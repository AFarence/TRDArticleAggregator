    "content": "Houston’s largest landowners include homebuilders carving out new suburbs and public entities managing flood zones and parks.\nThe top 10 landowners control about 2.6 percent of the metro, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe ranking was compiled based on an analysis of Harris, Montgomery, Liberty, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Galveston and Chambers counties, calculating acreage totals from public property records and mapping data and ranking by parcel totals.\nIt offers a snapshot of the region’s most influential landholders shaping development patterns in and around the Houston metro.\nPrivate developers dominate the landscape, with Camillo Companies leading the pack.\nThe Houston-based homebuilder owns 3,650 acres across six counties, supporting the development of 11,222 residential lots under its brands, including SimplyHome and Legend Homes.\nAnother major player, Arlington-based D.R. Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston’s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\nscrutiny over its business practices\n.\n\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City’s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\nHouston’s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro’s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston’s employment centers.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams’ new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby’s International’s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million — roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

    "content": "Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\nMiami-Dade’s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can’t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can’t earn more than $54,480.\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial’s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\n\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\neight-story, 132-unit\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\naffordable housing\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\npaused\nsome planned\nmultifamily\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\nrecord rent\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\n$14.8 million\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\n5,730\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\nThe Pérez family’s Related Group plans an\neight-story, 98-unit\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami’s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site’s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\nRussell Galbut’s GFO Investments family office proposes a\n410-unit Live Local Act project\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade’s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\n",

    "content": "Back when the sale of\nSignature Bank’s\nrent-stabilized loan book was fueling industry-wide gossip about\nsweetheart deals\nand stark discounts, the window into the sale process was all-but boarded up.\nNew documents now offer a look into who bid what and which parties’ money couldn’t sway the regulators.\nHere’s the upshot:\nCred over bread\nIn line with industry speculation, two slices of the $14.8 billion rent-stabilized loan book sold on the cheap despite a number of higher bids. That is, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation left some money on the table.\nStakes in the deals were awarded in three separate transactions. The largest went to Santander Bank, which faced no competing bids for the total $9 billion pool, FDIC documents show.\nOn the other sales, a venture led by nonprofit lender\nCommunity Preservation Corporation\nbeat out at least a dozen other parties despite bidding less than competitors.\nFor its 5 percent stake in the larger $4.3 billion pool, it paid the equivalent of 60 cents on the dollar; on the remaining $1.5 billion it paid 56 cents on the dollar, according to FDIC documents.\nConsidering the discounts at which rent-stabilized deals have traded in the past few years, the steep devaluation isn’t surprising.\nRent-regulated revenues have been effectively capped by state law for nearly six years. Meanwhile, expenses, including interest payments on mortgages, have soared. Buildings are underwater, and the deals that do trade are going for\npeanuts\n.\nWhat is striking is that there were four groups willing to pay more for a share of the $4.3 billion pool. The highest: 82 cents on the dollar from a venture between Brookfield Asset Management and Tredway.\nThe $1.5 billion pool drew five bids well above the 56 cents on the dollar CPC paid. The highest: 85 cents on the dollar by an unknown party, according to FDIC documents.\nWho’s worthy\nIn the thick of the sale process, Brookfield and Tredway, perhaps anticipating they’d be passed over, accused the agency of running a\n“secret”\nauction and picking winners that were not the highest bidders.\nThey claimed the move ran afoul of the FDIC’s directive to minimize losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by maximizing the value of assets.\n\nBut throughout the sale process, the FDIC repeatedly cited its mandate to maximize the preservation of affordable housing. The agency’s pick for the rent-regulated deals — CPC, which partnered with Related Fund Management and nonprofit Neighborhood Restore, seemed to jibe with that directive.\nCPC\ncut its teeth\nrehabilitating rent-stabilized buildings when the Bronx was burning in the 1970s. Neighborhood Restore helps handle the city’s third-party transfer program, which moves abandoned, delinquent buildings to responsible owners. Related, for its part, is a big owner of affordable housing, which it calls a “foundational element” of its company on its site.\nTo be fair, Brookfield and Tredway also own and operate affordable housing. It’s especially Tredway’s niche.\nThough, it could be argued that Brookfield’s rent-stabilized experience is concentrated in new buildings operating under 421a – not the much older stock in the Signature portfolios. And Will Blodgett, formerly of Fairstead, has more than a decade of experience with affordable housing; though, he’d only been running Tredway for two years when the Signature loan sales closed.\nThe FDIC did not specify the other three parties that outbid CPC. But the competition included entities tied to nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners and affordable housing owners and developers CIM Group, Slate Asset Management and Kushner Companies.\nDealing with distress\nThe smaller, $1.5 billion pool drew a different crowd.\nWinhall Investment Company, which deals in non-performing commercial real estate, made what the FDIC considered the next-best bid, though not the highest, at $55 million for a 5 percent equity stake. That’s 32 percent above what the CPC group paid.\nIt’s likely the FDIC, in working to meet its mandate, declined to take more money from a firm that specializes in optimizing the value of distressed debt, not preserving affordable housing.\nOther losing bidders may have raised similar red flags.\nAmong them: Meir Cohen’s Cohen Equities, another distressed debt investor; Ellington Financial, whose parent company foreclosed on the\nApplesway portfolio\nin Houston; and\nInterVest\n, which has partnered with Nightingale of the multi-million-dollar crowdfunding scandal.\nDespite CPC’s problem-solving reputation, the group has had to trade the carrot for the\nstick\nwith some borrowers.\nIn the past few weeks, the JV, operating under the name Community Stabilization Partners, has filed to foreclose on buildings owned by Ved Parkash, once named the city’s worst landlord by the public advocate, and a portfolio Madison Realty Capital acquired from notorious rent-stabilized owner Raphael Toledano. Toledano has since been banned from New York real estate for harassment of rent-stabilized tenants.\nCPC said it is also working out loans; though, it has yet to discuss details of those negotiations.\n",

The sale pencils out to about $70 per square foot.\nDenago plans to use the 29-acre, 620,000-square-foot facility at 3900 West Plano Parkway as a manufacturing hub, joining a growing list of companies establishing production lines in North Texas. DallasNews, formerly known as A.H. Belo Corporation, has owned the property since 1999, county records show.\nIt downsized its printing plant with a five-year lease valued at $3.5 million for a 67,600-square-foot facility in Carrollton last June, according to its\nlatest quarterly report\n. The property’s address was not disclosed.\nProceeds from the sale will be used to fully fund the company’s remaining pension obligations, with plans to transfer the pension to an insurance company. The pension’s balance stood at about $16 million late last year, and the transfer would remove the liability from the company’s balance sheet, it said.\n\nDallasNews’ pension expenses have been rising, with $1.42 million spent on net periodic pension and post-employments benefits in the first nine months of last year, more than double the $674,000 spent during the same period in 2023, the report said.\nThe company said last year it was moving to shed assets and return to profitability by moving to the\nsmaller printing plant with fewer workers\nto save an estimated $5 million a year.\nThe company has been selling off real estate assets since 2019, when it offloaded its historic downtown Dallas office building at 508 Young Street to developer Ray Washburne\nIn February, Washburne said he was selling to “one of the major data companies” to bring a data center to the 546,000-square-foot property,\nthrowing a wrench\nin the city’s intentions to integrate it into its larger convention center redevelopment plan. The deal is slated to close in April, Washburne said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The Zappettini family office has defaulted on $120 million in commercial mortgage-backed security loans tied to a 100,000-square-foot tech campus in Mountain View.\nThe San Francisco-based office led by John Zappettini received a notice of default from an undisclosed lender of loans tied to the Terra Bella Tech Park at 850-900 Shoreline Boulevard,  1212-1305 Terra Bella Avenue and 1330-1350 West Middlefield Road,\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal reported\n.\nThe family bought and developed the 10-acre office and industrial park with 17 buildings in the 1970s, then turned it into a tech campus. In 1921, it tried to redevelop it into a mixed-use village, with homes and commercial properties, according to its website.\nA default notice filed this week gives the Zappettinis 90 days to pay off the default amount. If they fail, the lender will record a notice of sale, Steven Hoffman, a real estate attorney based in Sunnyvale who is not connected to the situation, told the Business Journal.\nThe Business Journal reported in February that the\nMountain View tech campus had been heading toward foreclosure\nor a loan modification after the owner defaulted on a $120 million mortgage debt.\nLoan servicer reports obtained in January showed Zappettini Investment Company failed to repay the mortgage debt by its June 2024 maturity date. The initial loan default was\nfirst reported by The Real Deal\nthat month.\nCiti Real Estate Funding issued the two loans — one for $65 million and a second for $55 million — and then pooled them into commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.\n\nAs of last summer, leases for 40 percent of the tech park’s office, light-industrial and research and development buildings were set to expire within six months, a key factor in the default.\nThe Zappettini family was originally in the wholesale flower importing business and formerly used some of the Mountain View properties for its wholesale operations, according to its website.\nThe Zappettinis sold multiple parcels in Mountain View to Google in 2011, which the tech giant sold a few years later to the Irvine Company, according to public records. They sold another property to Google in 2016 for its now-abandoned\nGoogle Landings\nproject.\nThe family also owned almost 2 acres in the San Francisco Flower Mart from the 1950s until they sold it to Kilroy Realty in 2016 for $31 million in cash and $56 million in stock.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Philadelphia’s real estate industry will be paying close attention to the city’s budget process over the next few months.\nMayor Cherelle Parker revealed her 2025-26 budget proposal on Thursday, Bisnow\nreported\n, spending a few minutes of remarks to talk about real estate. A number of components of her budget proposal directly impact the industry.\nParker proposed the city borrow $800 million over a five-year period to\nbuild and preserve\n30,000 housing units across Philadelphia. The costs could be funded by several tax increases, including upping the real estate transfer tax from 3.28 percent to 3.58 percent, and increasing a document recording fee by $3.\nParker also called for the elimination of a 1 percent construction impact tax in hopes of getting more shovels in the ground. It’s unclear how much of the tax was actually an inhibitor to development, because it only generates $3.5 million for the city per year.\nThe proposal calls for $11 million in additional funding for the Philadelphia Department of Planning and Development to assist the hiring of 32 employees. Parker also pitched a reduction of the city’s wage tax and business income and receipts tax.\n\nNotably omitted from the budget proposal was the\nextension of a 10-year tax abatement\nfor conversion projects, pitched by the Tax Reform Commission last month. Finance Director Rob Dubow said the city prefers to simplify its tax structure by eliminating certain taxes, rather than altering abatements.\nThe city’s next big housing moment is only days away, when Parker reveals her Housing Opportunities Made Easy Initiative at a special session, a hearing she’s herself described as a “D-Day for housing.” That hearing is scheduled for March 24.\nThe coming fiscal year, meanwhile, begins on July 1, so the City Council needs to negotiate and adopt a budget before then.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Fair Housing Act funding for Chicago-area organizations is frozen.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development abruptly terminated or delayed grants to at least five local groups as well as 78 grantees across the country, leaving some without contracts or reimbursement since the start of the year, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nAmong those impacted is the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which had 16 months left in a three-year grant totaling $425,000 annually.\nThe termination was directed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, according to HUD’s termination letter to the group, which said the grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”\nAt least one group is challenging the cancellations in court, saying the termination of funds awarded through HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives Program is illegal.\nFour members of the National Fair Housing Alliance are suing HUD and DOGE over the allegedly unlawful cancellation of more than $30 million in grants through the program. The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, was filed Thursday in federal court in Massachusetts.\nThe South Suburban Housing Center and Open Communities in Evanston received the same letter and faces similar funding losses posed to disrupt decades of work supporting low-income and minority communities.\nThe nonprofit lost its two grants, which totaled about $1.4 million over the next three years, funds it has received since 1995. The amount represented 92 percent of its fair housing budget and 37 percent of its total organizational budget.\n\nChicago’s Continuum of Care network — responsible for coordinating housing services for the homeless — has over $112 million in HUD grants still pending contracts. At least 14 organizations have been operating without reimbursement since January.\nThe cuts come amid broader federal workforce reductions at HUD, including layoffs at the agency’s Chicago office.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Feb. 5, has defended the changes, saying the agency is “taking inventory” to improve efficiency. HUD officials have promised some clarity in the coming weeks, with letters to awardees expected soon.\nThe cuts are targeting racial justice initiatives and could erode protections for vulnerable groups, particularly as\nhousing discrimination\ncomplaints rise and\naffordable housing options shrink\n, the National Fair Housing Alliance said.\nFor other organizations, like Ignite, which provides services for homeless youth as the parent organization for Continuum of Care, the clock is ticking.\nIgnite has dipped into reserves to continue operations while awaiting its yearly $320,000 contract reimbursement. Others are turning to donors or state-level funding to close the gaps.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The plan also included indoor and outdoor parking and a public park.\nDes Plaines city officials had postponed a scheduled February review to give Advent time to revise the project following feedback from the council in December. But Advent withdrew its application earlier this month without explanation, according to city planning memos.\nAdvent, an entity tied to Paul Dukach, is reportedly still evaluating future development options for the nearly 3-acre site.\n\nThe withdrawal halts momentum for a proposal that could have contributed to Des Plaines’ broader downtown revitalization efforts. The suburb has been actively courting multifamily and mixed-use developments to reshape its urban core. Nearby projects include\nCompasspoint Development’s 131-unit apartment complex\nand the 212-unit Welkin project that opened in 2022.\nThe downtown Des Plaines apartment market has been\na draw for developers\nin recent years, with suburban multifamily investment outperforming Chicago’s core in terms of rental growth.\nSuburban rents rose 4 percent year over year in the fourth quarter, compared to 2.3 percent for central Chicago, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nAdvent’s withdrawal leaves a gap in the city’s downtown growth plans, though local officials indicated that development conversations could continue in the future.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A Seattle-based lender has filed a lawsuit against real estate investor Gary Segal, seeking more than $67.1 million for allegedly failing to honor a personal guarantee on a defaulted commercial real estate loan.\nColumbia Pacific Advisors filed the\ncomplaint\nthis week in New York Supreme Court, PincusCo\nreported\n. The lender claims Segal breached his obligations under a personal guaranty agreement tied to a loan for a Long Island City industrial warehouse, where an office development is planned.\nSegal guaranteed a loan made in December 2021 to the entity that owns 23-10 Queens Plaza South, according to the complaint. The original loan amount was $38.5 million, but through several modifications, the principal allegedly increased to $56.9 million by March 2024.\nThe lawsuit claims Segal failed to repay the loan when it matured in August. Despite receiving a notice of default in October, neither the borrower entity nor Segal has made any payments toward the outstanding debt, which now exceeds $67.1 million including interest and fees, according to the complaint.\nColumbia Pacific Advisors is seeking a judgment for the full amount due, plus ongoing default interest, legal fees and other costs outlined in the loan documents.\nThe lender initiated a separate UCC foreclosure process on the ownership interests in the borrowing entity. An auction is scheduled for May 9.\n\nColumbia Pacific Advisors did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n. Segal could not be reached for comment.\nTwo years ago, the City Council passed a zoning change that would allow Segal’s firm, Dynamic Star, to develop a 400,000-square-foot office building at the site, dubbed Opus Point. Segal purchased the property in 2019\nfor $27.5 million\n.\nLong Island City is not the only place where Dynamic Star is putting out alleged financial fires. This year, a joint venture of Blackstone and Rialto Capital\nfiled a pre-foreclosure action\n, alleging Dynamic Star and Namdar Realty Group defaulted on a loan for the Fordham Landing site in the Bronx.\nThe lender is seeking a receiver to oversee the site while pursuing a forced sale.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The development is near Fort Worth’s Cultural District, just off Interstate 30.\nThe antique mall has been a fixture in the district for more than 30 years, drawing loyal patrons and housing the Secret Garden restaurant. News of the redevelopment sparked social media backlash, with some residents calling it a “terrible decision” that could displace locals and worsen traffic. No one spoke in opposition at the council’s zoning hearing, despite online pushback.\nCouncil member Macy Hill noted that developers met with local stakeholders prior to the meeting and expressed optimism about the project’s potential to modernize the area.\n\nMontgomery Street Antique Mall’s owners have yet to announce whether the business will relocate or close.\nPhoenix is also working with the Texas Department of Transportation to address concerns about traffic flow and access at the nearby intersection of Montgomery Street and I-30.\nThe project is part of the redevelopment trend across Fort Worth. The council rezoned more than 83 acres along Montgomery Street for intensive commercial use, and downtown plans are progressing, including more than $2 billion in future projects and reimagining\nPanther Island as a waterfront district\n.\n— Judah Duke\nREAD MORE LINKS:\n",

    "content": "San Francisco officials have delayed suspending a voter-approved “Empty Homes Tax” during a legal challenge because of a push by Supervisor Jackie Fielder to keep the measure alive.\nThe tax, known as Proposition M, was approved in November 2022 with 54 percent of the vote and targets property owners with residential units left vacant for over 182 days a year,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nTaxes range from $2,500 to $5,000 based on size, rising to a maximum of $20,000 a year per unit, applying only to buildings with three or more apartments.\nFielder argued that amendments should be explored to prevent the tax from being suspended indefinitely while the city fights a lawsuit from landlords and property owners who say it violates their property rights.\nShe proposed that the tax suspension should only last “until the courts tell us otherwise,” allowing the city to collect if legally permitted. Fielder’s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\n\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\narguing in a ruling that property owners don’t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\nstruck down the tax\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court’s decision is reversed on appeal.\nThe city attorney’s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court’s decision.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Last year, Morgan Stanley purchased $700 million worth of loans from the trio. Also last year, distressed debt player Maverick Real Estate Partners\nacquired $247 million in debt\n, backed by eight properties including buildings in Midtown Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nIn December 2023, Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, BREIT, Rialto Capital and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\nscored a 20 percent stake\nin a venture holding Signature’s $17 billion commercial real estate loan book with a winning bid of $1.2 billion. The FDIC retained an 80 percent interest and provided financing equal to 50 percent of the venture’s value.\nA month later, the venture started\nshopping around\n$1.8 billion in performing loans, mostly backed by apartment buildings.\nThe collapse of Signature Bank and proliferation of its debt across firms continues to reverberate throughout New York City’s commercial real estate industry. This month, a group of lenders — Community Preservation Group, Related Fund Management and Neighborhood Restore —\nfiled six pre-foreclosure actions\nagainst borrower Madison Realty Capital at Manhattan properties once tied to the failed Signature Bank.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "The flight to quality office trend is responsible for yet another corporate relocation.\nAnderson Merchandisers is moving its headquarters from one Plano office to another; it’s leaving Granite Properties’ Granite Park III, which was built in 2007, for Apex at Legacy, a property delivered in 2021.\nThe retail merchandising company inked a deal to occupy 30,000 square feet — the full top floor — at the 210,000-square-foot office building, according to a news release from JLL. Anderson is bringing more than 100 employees to the space by the fourth quarter of this year, with plans to hire more.\nJLL’s Conor McCarthy and Jayme Schutt represented the tenant in lease negotiations. John Brownlee, Gini Rounsaville and Michael Williams represented the landlord, Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners.\nApex at Legacy, at 5801 Headquarters Drive, is a 14-story office building that was\ndeveloped\nby Dallas-based Heady Investments. Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners purchased the property in 2021.\n\nIt includes features like a game lounge that includes a golf simulator. It’s within walking distance from Legacy West, a mixed-use development in Plano with more than 400,000 square feet of retail and office space.\nThere are plans for expansion — the development will soon feature a second building with office space and a Kimpton Hotel, the release said.\nCorporate America’s push to return to the office has emphasized the flight-to-quality trend in the office market.\nCompanies like Anderson Merchandisers are luring employees into the office with top-of-the-line amenities. Meanwhile, operators of older inventory are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat’s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\n",

    "content": "Richard Ohebshalom’s Downtown\nBrooklyn rental building\nwent back to the lender in a foreclosure auction.\nChicago-based commercial real estate lender Prime Finance bought the brick-clad 103-unit apartment building at 180 Nassau Street for $1,000. There were no other bidders at the auction — but a few gasps erupted from the gallery as the $51.5 million upset price was announced.\nThe lender filed a foreclosure suit in 2022, the same year it bought a $52 million note on the property from Investors Bank. Prime claimed that Pink Stone failed to resume debt payments after a forbearance period extended to the developer ended that year. The court appointed a receiver in May 2023.\nThe debt on the property had ballooned to $58 million by August, when a state Supreme Court judge ordered a foreclosure auction for the property.\n\nOhebshalom, the son of Empire Management’s Fred Ohebshalom, bought the development site at Nassau and Duffield streets for $11.28 million from Brooklyn developer Isaac Hager in 2012. He wrapped up construction in 2014 on the 10-story rental building, known as Warehouse 180, and Investors issued the $52 million loan that year.\nOhebshalom tried\nselling the property\nin 2018, asking north of $60 million according to sources at the time, but no deal was reached. A potential obstacle was the looming phase-out of the building’s 421a property tax abatement, which caused property taxes owed on the building to increase.\nIn 2023, Ohebshalom\nlost control\nof a 7-story Soho building, including an apartment where he lived, after pledging the property as collateral for $4 million in mezzanine loans. A few years earlier, in 2018, Pink Stone found itself embroiled in a family feud when Ohebshalom filed\ntwo lawsuits\nagainst his father.\n",

    "content": "Longtime Douglas Elliman agent Pablo Alfaro joined Compass.\nAlfaro left\nElliman\nafter about 14 years. He’s been involved in sales totaling more than $1 billion over his 20-year career, according to a press release. That includes helping to bring new developments to Elliman such as Faena House, Alan Faena and Len Blavatnik’s ultra-luxury condo building; and Ian Schrager’s Edition Residences. Both are in Miami Beach.\nAlfaro most recently was\nleading sales\nat Rivage Bal Harbour Residences, Related Group, Two Roads Development and Rockpoint’s oceanfront luxury condo building at 10245 Collins Avenue. His listings include the nearly $25 million listing of a penthouse at Palazzo del Mare on Fisher Island. Recent deals include supermodel Elle Macpherson’s\n$18.5 million sale\nof her Coral Gables mansion in September.\nAlfaro joined\nCompass\non Monday, state records show. He’ll be based out of the Lincoln Road office in Miami Beach.\n\n“I see a lot of major changes going on in the industry, upper management, the way we run our business, social media. Compass was the best partner for me,” Alfaro said. “I run my business in a very private way.”\nAlfaro is the latest agent to leave Elliman for Compass over the past year. In South Florida, that list includes Thor Brown in Palm Beach and Bonnie Heatzig in Boca Raton. More recently, New York broker\nHolly Parker\n, who also operates in South Florida, joined Compass after 24 years with Elliman.\nThe moves have gone in both directions. While Elliman’s senior vice president of sales for development marketing in Miami,\nNikol Solares\n, left the brokerage for Compass in January,\nElliman brought on Drew Backoff\nas vice president of marketing for new development. Backoff was previously a senior leader at Compass’ development marketing arm.\n",

    "pub_date_dt": "2025-03-14T09:45:00",
    "content": "Just south of Palm Beach, the small island town known for its popularity with the rich and powerful, lies an even smaller island town: Manalapan. Long overshadowed by its more famous neighbor, it is now an ultra-luxury market hub with some of Florida’s most expensive home listings.\n“In the past, everyone only wanted to be on the [Palm Beach] island. Now, we’re seeing specifically people who want to be in Manalapan,” said Douglas Elliman agent Senada Adžem. “It’s not a Palm Beach address, but it’s become very prominent.”\nCurrently six properties are listed in Manalapan asking more than $50 million, remarkable for a town that spans just 2.4 square miles and has about 400 year-round residents, agents say. Those\ntrophy listings\ninclude a 4-acre spec estate\nasking $285 million\n. It would be the priciest home on the market in the U.S., except for a 9-acre Naples compound\nlisted for $295 million\n.\n“I’m shocked. I’m a little blown away with the amount of interest we’ve received,” said Nick Malinosky, the Douglas Elliman agent representing the record Manalapan listing.\nPerhaps the first sign of Manalapan’s ultra-luxury boom was\nbillionaire Larry Ellison’s $173 million\npurchase of a 16-acre oceanfront compound in 2022. It remains the most expensive home ever sold in Florida. Ellison doubled down on his investment in the town in August, dropping $277.4 million on the\nEau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa\n. All Manalapan residents are granted free membership to the resort, which functions as the de facto town center.\nOther high-profile Manalapan buyers include Fox News host Sean Hannity, who bought a waterfront mansion for\n$23.5 million\nin November.\nStill, brokers say many of their clients are interested first in a Palm Beach home. The island emerged from the pandemic as\nan epicenter of the American ultra-luxury market\n, a place where homes frequently trade for north of $50 million. Last year, the two\nmost expensive home sales in Florida\nwere both in Palm Beach: A private island sold for\n$150 million\n, and a historic oceanfront estate traded for\n$148 million\n. But with fewer than 2,500 homes on the 16-mile long barrier island, Palm Beach options are limited.\nPalm Beach’s market also has a crucial mismatch between what buyers want to buy and what sellers want to sell. Since the onset of the pandemic, affluent buyers across South Florida have prioritized large, oceanfront properties in turnkey condition. Nothing on the market in Palm Beach fits that bill. Pocket listings for such homes have make-me-move prices that agents say range from about $100 million to as much as $300 million.\nMeanwhile, oceanfront properties in Manalapan are abundant, and buyers don’t have to pay the premium for a Palm Beach address.\n“You’re going to get more bang for your buck,” Malinosky said.\nIn addition to large lots –– oceanfront Manalapan estates have a minimum of 150 feet of beach frontage –– the enclave is also a short distance from private schools, private airports and private clubs like President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. Many of the properties have both oceanfront and Intracoastal Waterway frontage, allowing for residents to keep their yachts docked in the backyard.\n\n“What they have to offer is exceptional,” said Corcoran Group agent Candace Friis, who has an oceanfront Manalapan listing asking $87 million.\nMalinosky agreed, saying spec developers in Manalapan also have a keen understanding of what ultra-luxury buyers want, something\nothers have struggled with\n.\n“There is no shortage of buyers who can spend $100 million, $200 million right now,” he said. But they want homes that check all the boxes: spa facilities, office space, a guest house and staff quarters are must-haves for buyers at that price range. Manalapan has ample listings with these amenities, agents said.\nAll together, these market dynamics have made Manalapan a household name among a certain set of sophisticated buyers, agents added.\n“There was a time I would have to explain to buyers coming to town what Manalapan is,” said Malinosky. Not anymore.\nHere are this season’s trophy listings in Manalapan:\n$285M | 1960 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Stewart Satter\nSpec developer and former Manalapan mayor Stewart Satter is\nasking $285 million\nfor the 4-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate planned for 1960 South Ocean Boulevard.

It will also have a guest house, boathouse, beach house, car museum, bowling alley, shooting range, padel court, gym, spa, theater and golf simulator, the listing shows. The design team for the estate, which is\nbeing marketed fully furnished\n, includes architecture firm Choeff Levy Fishman and Marc-Michaels Interior Design.\nMalinosky has the listing.\n$150M | 1370 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Christopher Rokos\nBillionaire hedge funder Christopher Rokos is asking $150 million for his 2.8-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate.

It has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, five half-bathrooms, a spa wing with a gym and wellness facilities, a billiard room, game room, theater and a 10-car garage with a club room, according to records and the listing. It is being marketed fully furnished with interiors by Marc-Michaels Interior Design.\nJack Elkins with William Raveis has the listing.\n$95M | 1140 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Joe Farrell\nSpec developer Joe Farrell has already found a buyer for the oceanfront estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard. He listed it for $95 million in August, and it became pending earlier this month, Redfin shows. Farrell bought the 1.6-acre site for\n$32.5 million\nin January of last year, and is planning a 19,000-square-foot, nine-bedroom main house and a 4,000-square-foot, four-bedroom guest house, eight-car garage, two pools and a pickleball court, the listing shows. Construction is expected to be completed later this year.\nMargit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties is representing both parties in the deal, she confirmed.\n$87M | 1160 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Robert Wexler\nSpec developer Robert Wexler is asking $87 million for the renovated oceanfront estate at 1160 South Ocean Boulevard. Records show his NBU Land Trust bought the 1.7-acre compound from Cantor Companies CEO Michael Cantor for\n$28 million\nin 2021. The estate was built in 1995 and renovated in 2022, records show. The compound includes a 14,800-square-foot main house with seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, according to records. It also has a 1,700-square-foot, two-bedroom guest house, a pool, gym, wine room, game room, theater, 13-car garage, staff quarters and a catering kitchen, the listing shows.\nCandace Friis and Phillip Friis with the Corcoran Group have the listing.\n$85M | 640 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Robert Wexler\nWexler has another listing down the road at 640 South Ocean Boulevard asking $85 million. Records show his trust bought the 1.9-acre oceanfront estate for\n$36 million\nin 2020. Built in 2019, it includes a 12,800-square-foot main house with nine bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and six half-bathrooms, according to property records. The compound also has a guest house, a guard house at the entrance, a wine room, gym, spa and pool, the listing shows.\nCasey Flannery with Equestrian Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.\n$79M | 1040 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: 1040 Ocean LLC\nA Delaware entity named for the address is selling the estate at 1040 South Ocean Boulevard, asking $79 million for the 2.2-acre compound built in 2018. The LLC’s address is listed as 616 Nimes Road in Los Angeles, which is a Bel Air mansion currently on the market for $56.8 million. The listing agent told the Wall Street Journal the owners are European, but declined to comment further on their identities. They bought the Manalapan mansion for\n$25.8 million\nin 2021.\nThe estate has a 16,400-square-foot mansion with eight bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, a guest house and a pool, according to records and the listing.\nMargit Brandt has the listing.\n$69.9M | 1460 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Vivian Dimond\nDeveloper and investor Vivian Dimond is asking $69.9 million for the 1.5-acre oceanfront estate at 1460 South Ocean Boulevard.

    "content": "The head of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices called bull on a\nWall Street Journal report\nclaiming Compass was in\n“advanced talks” to acquire the firm\n.\nIn an email to franchisees, HomeServices CEO and chairman Gino Blefari denied any ongoing deal discussions between the two companies.\n“I want to confirm to you that there are no discussions, negotiations, or agreements to sell HomeServices or any of its affiliated companies, and that includes the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise business,” wrote Blefari.\n“Moreover, no such sale is being contemplated,” he said.\nThe Journal first reported the residential giant was in talks for the firm, country’s fourth-largest brokerage, according to RealTrends.\n\nRepresentatives from BHHS and Compass did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe strong denial from Blefari is an abrupt turn of events in a deal that was expected to be coming together soon, sources told the Journal.\nThe move would be a major step in what has become a 12-month period of rapid consolidation for Compass, the nation’s largest brokerage by deal volume.\nCompass sent shockwaves through the industry last year when it announced\na $444 million deal\nto acquire Christie’s International Real Estate and @properties. @properties was the eighth-largest brokerage in the country before the acquisition, according to RealTrends.\nThe acquisitions have contributed to Compass’ push to grow its private listings network. In the firm’s most recent earnings call, Reffkin said 7,500, or 35 percent of the company’s listings, were off-MLS. In February, more than half of new Compass listings started as private exclusives or were available only on Compass.com, which are part of the company’s latest\nconsumer marketing strategy\n.",

    "content": "Padel may have fans everywhere\nfrom Brooklyn\nto\nBillionaires’ Row\n, but West Village residents won’t allow a new private members’ club hinged on the sport to get a liquor license without a fight.\nRoughly 30 people living in the neighborhood rallied against the proposal for 120 Leroy Street, which includes a rooftop restaurant and three padel courts, at a meeting with the state’s liquor licensing authority on Thursday.\nAmong their concerns, residents, brandishing signs reading “No Rooftop Restaurant” and “No Private Padel,” claim the project would drive noise up and add traffic and congestion to the largely residential area.\n“The community has been asking for a year, ‘Let us see your plans,’” said Massimo D’Angelo, an attorney representing a group of residents, who argued the team behind the project — including clothing designer Ronnie Fieg, the Cayre family’s Midtown Equities and the owners of Cafe Mogador — has been reluctant to share information with residents concerned about the plans.\nD’Angelo added that 450 local residents signed a petition opposing the project.\nThe authority denied a temporary permit for the premises and ordered the team behind the project to amend the application. Chair Lily Fan rebuked the applicants for failing to negotiate a solution.\n“Do something reasonable so that people will welcome you,” Fan said. She added that without the neighborhood’s support, “I don’t see how your business is going to survive.”\n“Convincing me is not a win,” Fan added. “That’s just the beginning. It’s these 450 people you have to convince”\nThe clash at the meeting was the latest development in a contentious saga between neighborhood residents and spearheads of the project, which is described as a private members’ club with spa, wellness, padel facilities and a restaurant. The restaurant is open to members of the public with a $50 cover charge.\nPlans for the building initially included a rooftop bar, though an attorney for the owners, Donald Bernstein, said zoning wouldn’t allow it. The developers instead pivoted to a rooftop extension of the restaurant and agreed not to allow any background music.\nAt the hearing, Bernstein said his clients would amend their application to exclude the restaurant’s rooftop extension and would seek only to license the restaurant on the floor below.\nAn architect for the project said at the hearing that the developers had invested $7 million in the project so far and that construction was about halfway finished with an expected completion in September or October this year — though residents strongly objected to his characterization of the progress.\n“That’s bullshit,” one resident yelled from the back of the room.\nAnother said, “We have eyes, you know.”\nWhen members of the authority asked attendees to quiet down, another added, “Someone needs to point out that he’s lying.”\nBut Bernstein dismissed their comments.\n“Money has been spent. Construction is being done,” he said.\nBernstein urged the authority to disregard the community’s objections to noise from the padel court, as the liquor license, if granted, would only apply to the restaurant and its rooftop extension, before he agreed to scrap it.\n“Whatever issue and complaints they have about the padel courts, this is not the right [venue] for it,” Bernstein said.\n\nFieg, Michael Cayre and a representative for the Mogador owners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe throwdown over the proposal began heating up last spring, when the developers applied for a liquor license and outlined their plans for the property’s roof and ninth floor. The fight was first reported by the\nNew York Post\n,\nIn the application, the team laid out its vision: a private members club with a spa, restaurant run by the acclaimed East Village restaurateurs, padel courts and a rooftop lounge with background music and the occasional DJ. The club, open from 7 a.m. until midnight, would allow non-members for a $50 fee and up to 20 private parties a year.\nResidents quickly rose up to block the plans. In May, members of Community Board 2, which includes Greenwich Village and the West Village, voted 33 to 1 to oppose the project, urging the SLA to deny the license application.\n“Noise pollution from this type of venue would be detrimental,” a couple with an eight-month-old child living at 421 Hudson Street wrote in a letter opposing the license. “A rooftop venue\nwith padel courts, alcohol, and loud music/live DJ all day until 12 a.m. every night of the\nweek is not at all in line with the character of this area.”\nAnother resident of the condo building objected to the project, claiming it would add “noise, drunken rowdiness, and crime to our lovely area.”\nBut the board’s vote was a suggestion, not a mandate, and the developer’s application continued to move forward, with residents pushing back each step of the way.\nThe following month, two state legislators, whose districts include neighborhoods near 120 Leroy, also wrote a letter to the SLA, encouraging them to deny the property’s liquor license. In the letter, State Senator Brian Kavanaugh and Assemblymember Deborah Glick pointed to residential buildings surrounding the property.\n“Most problematic is the rooftop bar and lounge,” Kavanaugh and Glick wrote in the letter, arguing it “would significantly increase the noise level experienced by these residents on a daily basis and late into the evening.”\nDespite residents’ vehement protests, by the end of the summer, signs pointed toward the license’s approval.\nSince the project is near other establishments that sell alcohol, it’s subject to the 500 Foot Law, which means the authority must determine whether issuing the license would be in the “public interest.”\nIn August, a judge sided with the applicants in a report, ruling the proposal met the public interest burden and recommending the authority grant the license.\nAt a January hearing on the license, community members once again voiced their objections to the project, and SLA chair Lily Fan ordered the developers to confer with residents privately to come to a resolution.\nBut a February meeting between the parties was to no avail.\n“The Applicants appeared for the February 22, 2025, Meet and Confer wholly unprepared and unwilling to foster a meaningful conversation with respect to the community members’ well documented and previously expressed concerns,” Massimo D’Angelo, an attorney representing a group of residents wrote to Fan last week.\nNow it’s back to the drawing board for the project’s team, who will have to re-file their application for a liquor license without the rooftop portion. Even with a small win under their belt, residents don’t appear to be backing down from their position.\n“Even if this proposed open-air padel stadium could be covered with a bubble, it would not be able to reduce the noise and lights that would disrupt this West Village residential community,” D’Angelo wrote in a statement.\n",

    "content": "A venture involving Zell Kravinsky’s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler’s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\nKravinsky’s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today’s elevated interest rates.\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland’s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\nselling off its smaller assets\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\n“There is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,” said Morning Sky’s Lev Kravinsky. “In general most of what we’re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It’s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.”\nFPA didn’t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\n\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm’s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\nreported\n.\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\nThat’s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\nset to raise rents\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\n",

    "content": "Andrew Cuomo got some attention this week for\ndefending bail reform\n, a\nmeasure\nhe signed as governor that critics blamed for rising crime (a claim the data\ndid not actually prove\n) and for signaling that wrongdoers wouldn’t be held accountable.\nBut there was another Cuomo action that sticks in the craw of some real estate people even more: his attempt to\nrein in the title industry\n.\nOne person from that field told me that although he’s not impressed with the other mayoral candidates, he won’t be voting for Cuomo because of the battle over\nRegulation 208\n.\nCuomo’s Department of Financial Services didn’t think customers should bear any of the cost of title insurance agents’ entertainment of real estate professionals — that is, the folks who can steer homebuyers’ business to them.\nIn fact, DFS tried to forbid the industry from giving gifts or doing anything resembling “wining and dining.” The agency called out such “unscrupulous practices” as bad for consumers, who tend not to shop around for title insurance.\nThe regulations followed a DFS investigation that the agency said “revealed that title insurance companies and agents have spent millions of dollars on inducements that the industry has charged back to consumers as ‘marketing costs.’”\nBut the industry challenged Cuomo’s action in court. The legal battle went on for years but title insurers eventually won — overcoming a\nruling in Cuomo’s favor\nby the Appellate Division, which called the inducements an “ethically dubious scheme.” Regulation 208 remains on the books today.\n“Why is it illegal for me to market my services!” the title professional said by email. “Why are we, as an industry, the only people in the real estate sector that are not allowed to entertain our clients? Must we go Dutch when inviting a client or prospective client for lunch or dinner?”\nWhat we’re thinking about:\nOne landlord on X bemoaned the field of mayoral contenders,\ncommenting\n, “Who would we vote for other than Cuomo? Eric Adams is Trump’s bitch; all the other candidates seem to be looney tunes\nDSA types\n.” Do you agree? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: Of all the metro areas in the country, New York had the largest natural growth last year, with 214,000 births and 141,000 deaths.\nElsewhere…\nNormally, New York City apartments priced below market rate don’t stay vacant long. But an owner of a 10-building portfolio in the Bronx lost $117,000 in potential rent last year while trying to re-rent affordable units through the city’s Housing Connect lottery system, according to a New York Housing Conference\nreport\n.\n\nThe group’s analysis focused on why it takes so long to match these units with eligible tenants, which should be like selling ice cream cones for a dollar on a 100-degree day.\nIn the above example, the landlord estimated that it would have missed only $20,000 in rent had it been able to simply list the units. The portfolio’s vacancy rate would have been 0.6 percent instead of 3 percent.\nIn case you missed it, check out\nmy column\nabout the poorly designed system that produces this result for owners of affordable housing across the city.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Thursday was\n$10.35 million\nfor a 2,695-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 500 West 18th Street in Chelsea. Deborah Kern and Steve Gold of the Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$259.5 million\nfor a portion of 333 Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn. Steiner NYC purchased the remaining stake from JPMorgan, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12 million\nfor a 3,344-square-foot townhouse at 214 West 11th Street in the West Village. The Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 93,072-square-foot, 12-story community and housing facility at 1546 East New York Avenue in Brownsville. David Kriegel filed the permit on behalf of Xenolith Partners.\n— Matthew Elo",

Aghamiri’s Msasa Properties\nfiled plans in September 2023\nto build the seven-story complex near San Jose’s Japantown.\nWith developers having built no market-rate projects larger than 20 units in the city last year, Aghamiri’s project appears to be the first large-scale multifamily development since 2023, in which 336 units were built.\nPlans call for 118 apartments on a half-acre north of Basset Street between North First and North Second streets, with six set aside as affordable for very low-income households. Parking would be available for 74 cars.\nInitial plans by Aghamiri included 18 affordable units, or 15 percent, but he cut it to 5 percent to make the project pencil out, according to Erik Schoennauer, a local land use consultant who spoke on behalf of the developer.\n\nThe project, designed by Oakland-based Studio T-Square, features a charcoal and white complex with balconies, according to a rendering, bookended by a brown brick sections.\nThe site is located in an opportunity zone, which offers tax advantages to developers.\nAghamiri bought the office property in 2022 for $5.3 million, or $442 per square foot.\nThe 61-year-old offices have been vacant for 10 months, and have been damaged by vandals, Schoennauer said. They’ve been 60 percent vacant for more than five years\nHe said Aghamiri hopes to break ground this summer, and complete the project in 20 to 24 months.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Add to the shuffle Chinese furniture manufacturer Sunon, which is negotiating to sublease R1 RCM’s 13,000 square feet space at 800 West Fulton.\nIf finalized, Sunon would join other furniture brands in the area, using the space as a showroom.\nR1 RCM was represented by JLL’s Andy Strand, Vital Proteins by Colliers’ Dougal Jeppe, and Sunon by JLL’s Sarah Silva and Nicole Becker.\nSterling Bay’s new offices will span the top two floors of a three-story building owned by Asana Partners.\n\nSterling Bay began to\nshed its Chicago assets\nlast year, likely to finance its Lincoln Yards project, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development on Chicago’s North Side\nthat has failed to attract investment\n.\nThe firm has also\nbeen selling off\nsome development parcels near Lincoln Yards and within Fulton Market itself.\nSterling Bay developed the 553,000-square-foot building at 333 North Green Street with JPMorgan in 2019, signing a long-term lease to have its offices in the building as part of the deal. The 19-story building is fully leased after nearly 97,000 square feet was\nleased by Dutch financial technology firm Adyen\nlate last year.\nFulton Market gained Google’s Midwest headquarters as well as McDonald’s, which leased the office building where Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Studios once stood.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A financier’s West Village condo just set a new record for Downtown Manhattan.\nHarsh Padia, CEO of HAP Capital, and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, traded their apartment for $60 million in an off-market deal that closed Thursday, the\nWall Street Journal\nfirst reported. The sale price was double what the Padias paid for the apartment in 2016.\nThe deal is now the most expensive for a condo in the area, surpassing private equity billionaire Robert Smith’s\n$59 million\npurchase of a penthouse in the Getty Building in 2018.\nThough it’s the priciest for a condo on record, the deal fell short of the largest townhouse sales Downtown, including a\n$73 million\nmegamansion that closed in Greenwich Village last year.\nThe buyer, whose identity remains unknown, paid roughly $10,300 per square foot for the duplex, which also features a sprawling private terrace overlooking the Hudson River. The ninth-floor unit has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a spiral staircase.\nSerhant’s Peter Zaitzeff and Compass’ Jim St. André represented the Padias in the deal. Compass’ Eric Brown and Zeve Salman brought the buyer.\n\nThe Witkoff Group’s 150 Charles has snagged several pricey resales in recent years. A company tied to Credit Suisse executive Robert Shafir sold a penthouse at the building for\n$52 million\n, or a whopping $11,500 per square foot, in 2023 after purchasing it for $29 million in 2016.\nThe developer launched sales at the building in 2013 and racked up an A-list roster of buyers, including Ben Stiller, Jon Bon Jovi and Irina Shayk. The building’s amenities include a spa, pool and fitness center.\nAlex Witkoff is now the sole CEO of Witkoff Group after his father, Steve Witkoff, was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by President Donald Trump. The elder Witkoff told Bloomberg this week he was in the\nprocess of divesting\nfrom his development firm and a cryptocurrency firm he co-founded with Alex and his other son, Zach Witkoff, to avoid conflicts of interest.\n—\nSheridan Wall\n",

The firm defaulted on the loan in January, according to CO.\nJake Sharp Capital, founded in 2020, is run by Lafayette Sharp, who lives in Dana Point, according to state business records.

    "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country’s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing “millions of property appraisals” over to 16 of the nation’s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump’s nominee\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte’s stance on Kaegi’s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal’s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as “regressivity.”\n\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can’t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\n“In recent years, we’ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County’s residential assessments,” Kaegi said in the release. “With the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.”\nA 2022 University of Chicago\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as “limitations in the data and methods used in assessment,” specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property’s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\n, in part, to “lack of data-sharing.”\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties’ Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi’s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\n",

CET Holdings is behind the Horizon mixed-use development and Bentley Ridge townhome communities, while Red Seal is advancing its Proximity and SkyVue residential projects. E3 Construction holds the largest land portfolio and is planning four residential projects within the district.\nThe rebranding comes as Texas-based Ewing Properties’\nrecent $200 million listing for The Riverside\n, a 65-acre waterside site slated for a massive $2.5 billion development. Three public parks and 5 million square feet of residential, office and retail space are in the plans.

    "content": "Arbor Realty Trust secured a $1.15 billion refinancing from JPMorgan that will go toward paying off its Collateralized Loan Obligation bondholders.\nThe lender said the funds from JPMorgan will be used to redeem the bondholders of two large CLOs. The bondholders will be paid in full, the company said in a release.\nJPMorgan is providing the refinancing as a repurchase line, also known as repo line, in which Arbor will use the proceeds to pay off its CLO bondholders. The refinancing also gives Arbor about $80 million in additional liquidity.\nThe news is a positive sign for Arbor. The lender has struggled with loan\ndelinquencies\nand announced it will cut\ndividends\nin its last earnings. Last year, Bloomberg reported that Arbor faced a probe from the FBI and the Department of Justice. Arbor has become the subject of\nshort-seller\nreports, which claim Arbor’s loans are distressed.\nMuch of the scrutiny about Arbor relates to its CLOs. The lender originates loans to multifamily owners and then securitizes them into something called a collateralized loan obligation, or CLO.\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates put strain on some of Arbor’s multifamily borrowers, who were stuck with floating rating loans, and led to an uptick in delinquencies and foreclosures. Arbor then had to\nmodify\nmany of these loans by pushing out maturity dates and providing temporary rate relief.\n\nBut any broader concerns about Arbor’s loan book did not deter JPMorgan from extending a massive repurchase line to Arbor. The deal is unusually structured, allowing Arbor to essentially refinance its debt at a lower rate and even take home some additional proceeds.\nIn exchange for the financing, Arbor transferred $1.4 billion of assets into a repurchase facility, of which $1.3 billion consisted of assets in two of its CLOs. The line is mostly non-recourse, according to Arbor.\nThe two CLOs Arbor intends to unwind have a leverage point of about 77 percent with pricing of SOFR plus 2.24 percent. The repurchase facility offers an 80 percent leverage and has a lower rate than the CLOS, according to Arbor. The lender did not disclose the exact rate.\n“This is an incredibly innovative transaction that creates tremendous efficiencies for us going forward,” Ivan Kaufman, Arbor’s CEO, said in a statement. “This result also continues to reinforce the quality of our loan book and the depth of our banking relationships.”\n",

    "content": "A LaSalle Street tower is hitting the market, but Chicago’s office market isn’t exactly dealing strong hands.\nBeacon Capital Partners listed its 40-story office tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a challenging moment for Chicago’s office sector, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nThe property, known as the U.S. Bank Building, is facing potential tenant losses and mounting financial pressure. The price wasn’t disclosed.\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down — a balance that now likely exceeds the property’s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\nTwo of the building’s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe looming vacancies add to the building’s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank’s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\n\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon’s\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\ndropped 62 percent last month\nfrom issuance four years ago.\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\nlast fall\n.\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization’s 10 South LaSalle Street. Feil was\nhit with a foreclosure suit\nby Wilmington Trust in January over contractors’ unpaid mechanics liens.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "It’s been a good week to be the ex-wife of a De Niro.\nClaudine De Niro, the ex-wife of Raphael, has entered into contract on her Tribeca condo asking $8 million, according to StreetEasy.\nThat deal came just days after Grace Hightower, the ex of Robert De Niro (Raphael’s father), sold her\nCentral Park West co-op for $18 million\n.\nUnlike Hightower, who sold her home for a loss, Claudine looks to have had a buy-low, sell-high strategy.\nRaphael bought the home, unit 2B at 60 Collister Street, for $\n3.5 million in 2012\n; in 2020, Claudine received ownership shares worth over $1 million, according to public records.\nIn 2023, Claudine, who is an agent at Compass, listed the home with an asking price of $7.8 million.\nCasa Blanca’s Hannah Bomze took over the listing with its new, higher price, earlier this year. Bomze declined to comment on the deal.\n\nThe nearly 4,000-square-foot apartment leans into its Downtown-loft features, with exposed wood beam ceilings and white brick walls, and a great room spanning over 1,000 square feet.\nThe home has four bedrooms; the primary suite comes with a walk-in closet, tri-head steam shower, heated floors and large tub. Two other bedrooms come with en-suite bathrooms.\nThe condo has tenants in place through the end of July.\nThe buyers are the owners of the building’s most well-known unit, a triplex maisonette known as the “Marble House,” according to a source familiar with the transaction. The unit’s owners, who bought the 80-foot-wide home for over $17 million in 2022, will likely combine the two units.\nThe Marble House comes with its own 45-foot-long pool, along with a sauna and steam room — and of course, lots of marble. The home, designed by former owner and “8 Mile” producer Stuart Parr, features four different types of imported marble across its 9,200 square feet.\nClaudine and Raphael founded the De Niro Team at Douglas Elliman in 2004, and in 2010\nappeared eighth\non\nThe Real Deal’s\nlist of top brokers in the city.\nThe pair separated in 2015 before finalizing their divorce in 2020. Claudine joined Compass shortly thereafter, where she works across Miami and New York City, according to her personal website.\n",

    "content": "A disgraced Venezuelan ex-banker identified in the Panama Papers joins a growing number of South Florida commercial real estate owners feeling the pinch of distress.\nAn entity managed by Eligio Cedeño in Coral Gables filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in Miami federal bankruptcy court on Saturday, two days before its four commercial units at\nBrickell House\ncondominium at 1300 Brickell Bay Drive were scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure auction.\nCedeño’s entity, Ectul Holdings, listed $19 million in assets and $13.3 million in debts, the bankruptcy petition shows. Ectul’s largest creditor is Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse 10, which won a $7.5 million final judgment against the entity in January, Miami-Dade court records show.\nEctul’s bankruptcy attorney Diego Mendez did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn October of last year, Fuse 10 filed a foreclosure complaint against Ectul alleging that the borrower defaulted on a $6 million loan issued in 2023, by missing two monthly interest payments and a payment to its real estate taxes and insurance account that year. Ectul entered into a forbearance agreement that expired in February of last year, the lawsuit alleges. Cedeño’s entity paid $7.5 million for the three commercial units in 2021, records show.\nEctul’s second largest creditor is North Miami Beach-based Blue Waves Investment, which also has a pending\nforeclosure\ncomplaint against the entity. The lawsuit alleges Ectul defaulted on a $5 million loan secured by a Brickell House penthouse also owned by the Cedeño entity. In 2023, Ectul paid $5.2 million for the 3,860-square-foot unit at 1300 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, records show.\n\nThe sale of the commercial units and the penthouse foreclosure complaint are stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.\nCedeño was among a half-dozen Venezuelan banking executives identified in the 2016\nPanama Papers\nas controlling secret offshore accounts, published reports state. Nearly a decade earlier, in 2007, Cedeño was arrested and detained in Venezuela for allegedly breaking the country’s currency laws and allegedly engaging in illegal transactions to obtain U.S. dollars.\nHe was released two years later and fled to the U.S. In 2011, the U.S. government granted Cedeño asylum, according to published reports.\nAcross South Florida, commercial property owners are catching the brunt of market headwinds. This month, a lender slapped Don King with a foreclosure complaint that alleges the legendary boxing promoter defaulted on a\n$5 million\nmortgage secured by a Deerfield Beach warehouse he owns.\nBrooklyn-based investor and Holocaust survivor Zipporah Goldstein is also feeling a lender’s heat. Recently, Troy, Michigan-based Flagstar Bank filed a foreclosure complaint in Miami-Dade County against Goldstein’s entity that owns nine ground-floor commercial units inside a three-story Art Deco building in Miami Beach. Flagstar alleges Goldstein and her entity defaulted on a\n$5.5 million\nloan.\nLast month, a partnership among Miami-based builder Marlon Gomez and Coral Gables-based developers Fausto Callava and Antonio Pardo was hit with a foreclosure complaint alleging the joint venture defaulted on a\n$10 million\nloan secured by a 1.8-acre Miami River development site.",

    "content": "A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit — calling it a “sweetheart deal” for the builders and the “worst settlement” he’s ever seen, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point “paltry,” and accused the plaintiff’s lawyers of selling out their clients.\n“No question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,” he said during a January hearing.\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard’s ongoing toxic cleanup.\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\nDonato accused the residents’ attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a “common interest agreement,” which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are “adverse parties” who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\nSuch a settlement “becomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests” of an absent defendant, Donato said.\n\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: “The judge’s order speaks for itself.”\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents’ complaint for the sixth time. The changes “drastically narrowed plaintiff’s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,” Donato wrote in his order.\n“The evidence of collusion is striking,” Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for “paying nickels.”\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter’s Point.\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\nto “see if they are interested in negotiating.”\nTetra Tech EC has faced\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\n$97 million\n, according to the Chronicle.\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the “negative fiscal impact” of the fraud at the shipyard is between\n$370 million and $570 million\n.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A flight to quality by Seattle office tenants could be a boon for Su Development, which plans to build a 23-story apartment tower in Bellevue — now a suburban challenge to the Emerald City.\nThe locally based developer has filed revised plans for a high-rise at 205 105th Ave NE, the\nPuget Sound Business Journal\nand\nDowntown Bellevue Network\nreported. It would replace a shuttered sushi restaurant.\nThe building, dubbed 205 Tower, would contain one of two options — either a 260-foot-tall building with 164 units and 5,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, or a 308-foot building with 173 apartments, with similar retail.\nThe project, designed by locally based MZA, is “an architectural expression of Bellevue’s evolution,” according to the project narrative.\nThat evolution, across Lake Washington from Seattle, includes a growing tech hub that’s now home to eBay, Meta, ByteDance, Oracle, Salesforce, Google, Microsoft and a\nmajor Amazon campus\n.\nSeattle-based\nAmazon.com\nhas 14,000 employees in Bellevue and plans to\nadd 11,000 more\nin the coming years, with downtown poised for more multifamily projects like 205 Tower, according to the Business Journal.\nSu, a vertically integrated design-build firm, is known for its architecturally dazzling projects, including a\ntwo-tower development at Yesler Terrace in Seattle\nand Soma Towers in Bellevue.\n\nIts latest project seeks to capitalize on its location along the Grand Connection, a series of projects designed to uplift the pedestrian experience between Meydenbauer Bay Park through Downtown, and across Interstate 405 to an Eastrail multi-use path.\nThe proposed glass towers at Northeast Second Street and 105th Avenue Northeast contain a sculpted crown atop a five-story podium, with exterior balconies jutting from floor-to-ceiling windows, according to renderings.\nThe first concept draws on the interaction between water and land, highlighting the contrast between Bellevue’s urban landscape and an adjoining park, according to dbNetwork. The second is based on Pacific Northwest stone outcroppings, with a prominent vertical element.\nSu’s project “directly engages” with the Grand Connection with a public plaza along Northeast Second Street, with “retail frontages, seating areas and landscaping to create a dynamic, human-scaled environment,” according to a project filing.\nZoe Wang, project architect for Su, said the company wants to break ground by the end of next year.\nSu, founded in 1981 by John Su, built Downtown Bellevue’s first concrete-and-steel condominium building, and has developed more than 2,400 apartments, according to the Business Journal.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In February, more than half of new Compass listings started as private exclusives or were available only on Compass.com, which are part of the company’s latest\nconsumer marketing strategy\n.\n\nThe firm also notched its most successful financial year since going public in 2024,  with its share price more than doubling in the last 12 months as it reported its first cash-flow positive year.\nBHHS had 820 brokerage offices and 270 franchises at the end of 2024.\nThe real estate arm of Warren Buffett’s conglomerate entered the New York City market in 2017 but has had a difficult time gaining a foothold since then, ranking 18th in the\nTRD\n’s most recent brokerage rankings.\nElsewhere in the United States, BHHS Chicago boasts a roster of more than 1,300 real estate professionals.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices acquired Ron Shuffield’s EWM Realty International in 2003. The Coral Gables, Florida-based firm, now called BHHS EWM, has more than 700 agents and employees across seven offices in South Florida.\nHomeServices made headlines last year when it\nagreed to pay $250 million\nto settle antitrust lawsuits accusing it of colluding with the National Association of Realtors and other major brokerages to hike agents’ pay. The settlement was the largest payout offered by the brokerage defendants, outpacing the $58 million deal reached by Compass.",

    "content": "As Steve Witkoff dives deeper into the diplomatic world, he’s pulling back on his real estate ties.\nThe business man and President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East\ndisclosed to Bloomberg\nthat he’s in the process of divesting from the Witkoff Group and World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency platform co-founded by Alex and Zach Witkoff. Alex has already assumed day-to-day responsibilities of the development firm, which Steve founded almost 30 years ago.\nWhen Witkoff joined the administration, ethics questions quickly followed considering how much of his business can be tied to places all over the world. In divesting from his firm and crypto assets, Witkoff is hoping to be judged on his diplomatic results going forward.\n“How do you ensure you’re not using the special envoy role to skew policy your way?” Harold Hongju Koh, a former legal adviser to the State Department, told Bloomberg.\nWitkoff and Trump were already enmeshed, business-wise. Both of their families have stakes in World Liberty Financial. Witkoff was also an investor in Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover; Musk leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency today.\nNow Witkoff is following Trump’s lead by installing progeny atop a real estate company when entering the political fray, though ethics questions about Trump’s businesses continue to linger.\n\nFederal ethics law mandates senior Cabinet officials divest individual stock holdings and assets that could bring about conflict of interest concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is divesting his business interests, recently\nnaming one of his sons\nas the chair of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nWitkoff’s fortune is estimated to be around $782 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though one person familiar with his finances suggested it could be double that.\nWitkoff has been especially busy internationally during the first couple of months of Trump’s second administration, and even before then, despite his lack of diplomatic experience. He helped negotiate the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He also\nmet with Russian president Vladimir Putin\nlast month and will soon do so again.\nIn some ways, he’s following in the footsteps laid out by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Ivanka Trump’s husband jumped from real estate to politics — negotiating the Abraham Accords — before jumping back into business. Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, counts $4.6 billion in assets, essentially all\nfrom foreign investors\n.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "A developer scored a $53.5 million construction loan for a 250-unit apartment complex in Boynton Beach, amid a multifamily supply overhang in South Florida.\nTM Real Estate Group plans the Shalimar at Boynton Beach project with 10 three-story and four-story buildings, a nearly 10,000-square-foot clubhouse and 4,300 square feet of retail in two additional buildings at 3570 West Boynton Beach Boulevard, according to a city commission meeting agenda from 2022, when the project was approved.\nCharlotte, North Carolina-based Truist Bank is the lender of the construction loan.\nTM Real Estate, based in Coconut Grove, paid $16 million for the 12.5-acre development site in 2021, records show.\nFounded in 2005, TM is a development, investment and management firm focused on South Florida multifamily and mixed-use properties, according to its website. Matthew Pellar is CEO of TM.\n\nIts portfolio includes the 240-unit Shalimar at Davie complex at 4901 Shalimar Lane in Davie, and the 240-unit Shalimar at Plantation West at 8500 Cleary Boulevard in Plantation.\nIn 2021, TM sold the Lincoln Square office complex consisting of a pair of five-story buildings at  18405 Northwest Second Avenue in Miami Gardens for\n$15.4 million\n.\nSouth Florida’s multifamily market has slowed compared to the boom years of 2021 and 2022 when the tri-county region experienced an influx of out-of-state residents and record rent hikes. After developers seized on the bonanza, they completed a record 18,600 units last year, outpacing 15,000 in new leases, according to CoStar Group data. This led to\nslower lease-ups and increased concessions\n. Median monthly rent hit $2,328 in January, down nearly 2 percent, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nDemand could catch up to supply late this year or next year, partly due to a drop in construction starts, experts said.\nConstruction loans\nhave flowed, including for multifamily projects. Last month, White Oak Development scored\n$67 million\nto build a pair of four-story buildings with 286 apartments at 4181 and 4233 Davie Road in Davie. That came on the heels of the Caltagirone brothers’ Calta Group scoring a\n$53.7 million\nconstruction loan for 251 apartments in two Hollywood projects, at 2750 Van Buren Street, and at 2217-2239 Jackson Street.\n",

He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff — Chairman John Goff’s son — to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent’s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm’s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas — a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components — and the Robert L. Crandall corporate campus for American Airlines in Fort Worth.\nIts development activity is also expanding. Crescent is advancing a\nsecond office tower in Fort Worth\n, constructing the 30-story, 215-unit\nCrescent Point Tower\nin Uptown Dallas and preparing to open a 31-story\nluxury apartment building\nat 2811 Maple in May, where rents start at $4,000 a month.\nIt recently started development on its 92-home\nhigh-end housing project in Horseshoe Bay\nnear Marble Falls, northwest of Austin. Groundwork and infrastructure at the 114-acre site is expected to be completed in March 2026.\nSuszynski said the company is deepening its focus on high-quality development, particularly in Uptown Dallas and Fort Worth, where Crescent is looking to cultivate environments that mirror the success of its flagship properties.\nThe leadership team has an average tenure of over 12 years, Suszynski said.\n",

    "content": "Las Vegas Sands’ vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city’s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino — pending state legalization — as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands’\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban’s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\n\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project’s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to “ongoing engagement and collaboration,” spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Six years after allegedly trashing a vacant property it intended to buy for $10.7 million, the city of Doral will pay the landowner nearly double the originally agreed purchase price.\nOn Wednesday, the\nDoral\nCity Council approved a settlement agreement that will pay Doral 10, an entity managed by Lizbeth Arencibia of Hialeah Gardens, $21 million to drop a 2019 civil lawsuit in Miami federal court. The settlement includes $17 million to buy the 9.6-acre site, with the remainder paying for Doral 10’s losses from not being able to use the property and attorney fees, said Raul Gastesi, a private lawyer representing the city.\nArencibia is the daughter of the late\nLowell Dunn\n, a developer whose family members are among the largest landowners in northwest\nMiami-Dade County\n. The 9.6 acres are between Northwest 102nd Avenue and 104th Avenue just north of 68th Street.\n“The market has changed dramatically since [the lawsuit was filed],” Gastesi told the city council. “And we were not doing well in court. [Doral 10] has not been able to develop the land or do anything on the land due to contamination that they allege we caused.”\nDoral 10’s attorney, Alejandro Brito, did not respond to requests for comment. The property owner sought $30 million in damages when Doral 10 initially filed its complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The lawsuit was transferred to federal court, where the city won a dismissal in 2020, court records show. The ruling was overturned on appeal in 2023.\n\nThe lawsuit also named three contractors, JVA Engineering Contractor, EE&amp;G Environmental Services and BBC Engineering, as defendants. But Doral 10 voluntarily dismissed the counts against the three firms, which were hired by\nDoral\n, court records show.\nBetween January and May 2019, the city and its trio of contractors used the site as a staging area for a roadway project without Doral 10’s consent, the complaint alleges. Yet, city officials allegedly “falsely and knowingly represented” to JVA and Miami-Dade County’s environmental permitting department that they had obtained the property owner’s permission.\nDoral 10 also accused JVA of taking clean fill from the vacant site to recycle contaminated soil that was excavated for the roadway project. The contractor then deposited contaminated soil mixed with clean fill onto Doral 10’s property, the lawsuit states.\nFour months into using the site as a staging area and without informing Doral 10, city officials informed the property owner that a required environmental remediation of the land would cost a minimum of $2.8 million, according to the complaint. As a result,\nDoral\nofficials opted to terminate the deal to buy the land, which the city planned to convert into a park.\nGastesi provided city council members with a grim outlook if Doral took the case to trial. “I would rather recommend you purchase the land rather than pay the damages,” he said. “The court is likely to find against Doral.”",

    "content": "Voucher recipients across Illinois are struggling to find housing as challenges in subsidized housing programs grow, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nMost subsidies come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients to pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent while local housing authorities cover the rest.\nYet many recipients are unable to lease units due to hurdles including landlords\nrefusing to accept vouchers\n, often due to discrimination, and a lack of inventory.\nThe Chicago Housing Authority’s lease-up rates fell to 31 percent last year, down from 45 percent in 2023. The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color — two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the “real urban experience of living in San Francisco,” which he didn’t associate with the city’s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, “eyes wide open,” buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n“No surprises,” he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. “We knew everything—all the good and the challenges that we were in for—and saw some real improvements along the way.”\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it’s “impossible to replicate what’s been done here,” according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it’s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n“You really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,” he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is “baked in” to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n“Not everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,” said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk’s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn’t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today’s “value-driven buyer.”\n“We wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,” Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The “perfect fit” would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women’s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has “flirted with” the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can’t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n“They want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,” he said.\nThat’s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n“It’s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,” he said. “It was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.”\n",

    "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder’s remedy.  And now La Cañada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Cañada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n“Continuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,” Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Cañada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder’s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder’s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Cañada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder’s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n“The message is: stop playing games with housing,” Leaderman said. “There’s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.”\nDespite the city’s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder’s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n“The City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,” Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n“The ball’s in their court,” Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary’s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create “permanently affordable units in the City’s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,” according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager’s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city’s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city’s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC’s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in “good condition” and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD “seized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco”. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot  “offers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.”\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That’s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, “With its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.”\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers’ agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin. At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni’s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

    "content": "A Grayslake-based real estate company whose manager reportedly paid an unhoused Chicagoan to take over the deeds of run-down properties it picked up in bulk and later sought to offload has become the latest target of the city.\nThe company, Goldmine Investments, and another Hinsdale-based investor, QCD Financial, follow a pattern of owners being pursued by a city task force that’s designed to pin down Chicago’s most indebted landowners. Both firms are alleged large-scale “land speculators” that bought up heavily distressed properties, often vacant lots, purchasing them under the names of various LLCs used to muddy the ownership of the properties, according to complaints filed by the city in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThey collectively owe $9 million in fines to the city from municipal code violations related to neglect and environmental hazards at their properties, which are predominantly concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods on the South and West sides of the city.\nThis is when “land speculation becomes problematic,” the city said in the case brought against QCD.\nFor its most negligent landowners, the Chicago Department of Law’s special collections unit is moving to consolidate judgements made against owners in city administrative hearings into lawsuits filed with the Circuit Court — as it did for QCD, Goldmine and\ninfamous Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson\nin recent months. The city recently reached a tentative, $11.5 million settlement agreement with Wilson to resolve an estimated $49 million in legal claims it brought against her and her companies.\nAfter bringing down Wilson, the city “seized an opportunity once we learned that there was an individual — individuals — who are accumulating property in a particularly unique way around these title structures that allow them to constantly change the titles without anyone in the city or the county noticing that was happening,” Chicago’s top lawyer Mary Richardson-Lowry said.\nNow, the unit is doing more research to track ownership and moving aggressively when they can bring legal action against the people behind the landlord LLCs — and officials are open to seeking to freeze personal assets in some circumstances as a “motivator,” said the city’s deputy attorney David Holtkamp, who runs the unit.\nNext on the city’s list of troubling landowners: Grayslake resident Keith Moll, the manager of Goldmine, according to court filings and business registry information.\nDigging into Goldmine\nThe city says that Goldmine owns hundreds of properties in Chicago and is just “one of many shell companies created by (Moll) to hold title to real estate in distressed neighborhoods.” Goldmine allegedly owes the city over $5.2 million in fines from more than 1,500 counts of blight-related code violations, according to city litigation.\nThis is not the first time that an LLC managed by Moll has been sued by the city, according to a\nChicago Tribune report from 2015\n. The city sued Z Financial Illinois G Properties, LLC a decade ago to force the company to repair, demolish or cover the cost of demolishing unsafe structures on its properties.\nShortly thereafter, Moll transferred ownership of several of the properties to an unhoused man named Abana Tabb, who told the newspaper Moll paid him to take the five properties.\n“(He said) ‘I wanna dump a couple of houses on you. Don’t worry about it. You’re not gonna get in trouble, blah, blah, blah … sign here,’” Tabb told the newspaper.\nAs a result, Tabb was added as a defendant in the city’s cases against the properties and Z Financial was let off the hook in nearly every case. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office later investigated the transfers, but ultimately closed the case without filing any charges.\nZ Financial acquired the properties through the county’s delinquent tax and scavenger sales — a high-risk, high-reward investment arena.\nTax buyers used to be able to earn double-digit interest rates as residents paid back taxes — they can still earn significant interest after state law was\nrecently reformed\nto lower the maximum rates to cut a break to homeowners who fall behind. But when those taxes aren’t repaid and the deed is turned over to the taxbuyer, investors like Moll can end up with a lot of properties that are worth less — or would cost more to repair — than they paid for them.\nMoll didn’t return requests for comment made by\nThe Real Deal\nvia phone and email.\nTransferring property in this way is not illegal and Moll told the Tribune that he gave the properties to Tabb because the man expressed a desire to rehabilitate and live in them. But a co-defendant in a recent city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Damien Garrett Chiodo, said this instance of it is unethical, if true.\n“I don’t know these guys. For all I know, they’re good guys and got themselves in just a pickle,” Chiodo said. “But I do know it smells bad.”\nChiodo said he became aware of Goldmine when he received notice that he was named in a city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Moll, himself and Novacore, LLC — an Arizona-based company, now inactive, formerly managed by Chiodo and others, according to court records and business registry information.\nThe complaint, which came in December as the city restarted gunning for Moll, centers around two neighboring properties in the South Shore neighborhood that the city claimed owners allowed to become “an illegal parking lot and dumping ground for abandoned vehicles and refuse.”\n\nNow, this is where things get tricky.\nUntil 2014, a single-family home straddled the line between the two properties at 7543 and 7545 South Oglesby, so they were typically bought and sold together, but had two separate property identification numbers with the county.\nIn 2003, the then-owner of the property transferred the ownership to someone new and signed a deed for both properties that was only recorded against the property identification number for 7543 South Oglesby. The other property, 7545 South Oglesby, was later sold at a scavenger sale, creating a whole different chain of ownership for that parcel.\nMoll’s other company, Z Financial Illinois G Properties, bought 7545 South Oglesby in 2011 and then transferred it to Goldmine via quit claim deed in 2017, property records show. Novacore acquired 7543 S. Oglesby through a quit claim deed in 2014, a deed that also included the property description of the neighboring lot.\nThe two properties have been in a state of neglect that the city claims is an environmental hazard to the neighborhood since 2023. So, when notices of code violations weren’t met with compliance, the city filed suit against both companies and the people they could tie to them, including Chiodo.\nChiodo, who is now the president of KeyLink, a company that helps manage distressed real estate assets for clients like banks and hedge funds, said he did not receive notice of the violations sent to the business because it has been dissolved. Arizona business registry information shows that the LLC has been inactive since 2019.\nThe city asked the court to order that the defendants in the case clean up the properties immediately and is seeking $4.35 million in damages, based on complaints that the owners of the properties used it as an illegal parking lot for abandoned vehicles and failed to put up required fencing or take down a falling tree, creating an environmental hazard for residents in the area.\nWhen he received notice of the suit, Chiodo said he paid to clean up the sites as requested and is hoping to clear things up with the city as soon as possible.\n“We had no idea we even owned the thing, and we’re just trying to make it right and get out from under this mess,” Chiodo said.\nMeanwhile, Moll is unlikely to be absolved anytime soon as the city has moved to consolidate three cases brought against Goldmine Investments to be litigated together in Circuit Court.\nQCD Financial\nHinsdale-based investor QCD Financial has been found liable “at least 1,618 times” for municipal code violations across 125 properties it owns, allegedly amassing over $3.8 million in fines and interest since 2013, according to court records.\nQCD has been operating in Chicago for at least the last 11 years, and the city has been slapping the landowner with health and safety violations ever since, court records show. The company currently owns at least 123 properties across the South and West sides of the city, according to a map compiled by the city.\nA Circuit Court judge granted a city motion that was filed in December to consolidate past judgements made against QCD into a single case. In the coming months, the court will weigh in on the central question that remains before the two parties: how will QCD pay its debts to the city?\nAttempts to reach QCD weren’t successful.\nA spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law declined to comment on the specifics of the cases brought against QCD and Goldmine in recent months, but confirmed that the city’s special collections unit had taken “additional enforcement actions” against the two companies.\nThe city’s special collections unit is a group of attorneys housed under the Law Department’s Collections, Ownership, and Administrative Litigation Division that evolved out of lessons the division learned while tracking and enforcing the debt racked up by another Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson, Holtkamp said.\nWilson racked up over $15 million in fines for municipal property violations and may be barred from ever investing in Chicago real estate again as part of any settlement that might be reached in a bankruptcy case filed by her businesses in the fall, Holtkamp said. The two sides will meet to discuss the proposed settlement on April 1. It remains uncertain whether the final agreement will include a ban on investing in Chicago.\nAs the city’s special task force ramps up its work, it will start by focusing on about 10 more landowners that hit a certain threshold of unpaid fines and fees with the city, including QCD and Goldmine.\n",

    "content": "Related California and East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation have employed an Oakland overlay zone for affordable housing to win approval for a 192-unit complex in Jack London Square.\nThe Irvine-based builder and locally based nonprofit developer used\nS-13 zoning\nto approve the five-story affordable apartments around a central plaza at 430 Broadway, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe joint venture had\nsought permits last fall\nto build the three-building, block-size project on land owned by Alameda County, south of Interstate 880 between 5th Street, 4th Street, Broadway and Franklin Street. The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it’s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway. A rendering suggests two seven- or eight-story buildings and a 20-story tower overlooking I-880.\nRelated California, founded in 1989, is a unit of New York-based Related Companies. The California subsidiary has developed 20,700 apartments, and owns and manages more than 13,000 affordable and workforce housing units across the Golden State, according to its website.\nEast Bay Asian Local Development, founded in 1975 by a group of Asian Pacific Islander college students and young professionals, owns and manages more than 35 residential and commercial developments, according to its website.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Developer Vivian Dimond took over the stalled condo building in North Bay Village, a 15-story shell on Harbor Island,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe planned\n54-unit building\nat 7918 West Drive will now be called Tula Residences.\nDimond’s\nBayshore Grove Capital is now the sole managing member of the LLC that owns the property, she said. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project, but is no longer involved in construction or the development.\nDimond declined to share financial terms of the deal, but said the agreement was finalized last year.\nConstruction of the building, which will rise to 21 stories once completed, stalled in late 2023,\nTRD\npreviously reported. Liens piled up against the developer, including a nearly $7 million lien filed by Thornton Residential, the former general contractor. A cooling company also filed a lawsuit against Pacific &amp; Orient.\nDimond said construction will resume “very soon” and will likely be completed within 18 months, sometime in 2026.\nThe new team made some changes to the floor plans and amenities, Dimond said.\n\n“We just got approved for some changes we made with the city,” Dimond said, referring to the floor plans. “The number of units didn’t change, but the layouts changed.”\nThe lobby will now be on the first floor; it was previously planned for the sixth floor. Dimond said the amenities, like the gym and pool, were enhanced with an emphasis on wellness. Some of the windows are also larger, offering better views.\nSales will launch this spring with\nEllis Bachman\n, who recently joined Brown Harris Stevens from Douglas Elliman’s Eklund-Gomes team, Pedro Cuberos and Madison Napoles. Bachman said the project was a “major factor” in deciding his move to BHS.\nThe units will range from two- to three-bedroom condos, as well as six five-bedroom penthouses. The two-bedroom units will start at just under $2 million; the three-bedrooms at nearly $3 million and the penthouses at close to $6 million. They’ll each have large outdoor terraces and waterfront views.\nSales will launch soon, Bachman said, calling the project “accessible luxury.”\nThe developer is also negotiating construction financing, Dimond said. Dimond, a broker and developer, has 1,500 residential units in the pipeline through her Coconut Grove-based Bayshore Grove Capital. Bayshore’s projects include\nLe Parc at Lauderhill\n, a 330-unit apartment development in Broward County, and a mixed-use project with about\n900 workforce housing units\nnear Miami’s Allapattah.\nDespite the delay with the previous developer, the\nNorth Bay Village\nproject will still mark the first new condo building to be completed in the city in more than a decade. The town has attracted major investment in recent years, with a number of projects in the pipeline. Last year, Mikael Hamaoui’s Riviera Horizons\nlaunched sales\nof a Pagani-branded condo project in North Bay Village; other developments include a phased megaproject by the billionaire Ansin family’s Sunbeam Properties, and the\nEichner family’s\nplanned Continuum Club &amp; Residences.\n“I like the fact that it is way ahead of everyone else,” Dimond said.\nP&amp;O’s Chan had been working on plans for the project for almost a decade. The developer paid $8.3 million for the 0.8-acre site in 2015. Construction was set to begin in 2018, but the firm broke ground years later, in 2023.\nSales launched\nthat same year. One of two presales from before Dimond’s involvement will remain, she said.\n",

    "content": "Another CrowdStreet executive has left the company.\nBrendan Sparrough, CrowdStreet’s former head of capital markets, has departed the embattled crowdfunding platform for a new position with a real estate private equity firm, according to a post on LinkedIn.\nSparrough is now the second high-level executive to leave CrowdStreet, a platform that allows everyday investors to invest in real estate, in recent weeks.\nCrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\nIan Formigle\nrecently announced on LinkedIn that he accepted a new role.\nFive employees working as investment managers or analysts left CrowdStreet in February, according to a review of FINRA’s BrokerCheck.\n“Personnel change is inevitable when you are expanding your value proposition and it is no secret CrowdStreet is actively structuring our business model to expand to other asset classes, including with several new executive hires over the past several months. CrowdStreet is evolving,” said a spokesperson for CrowdStreet.\nSparrough played a key role in CrowdStreet’s relationships with institutional clients, leading the company’s capital markets team that sourced and selected deals for the platform.\nSparrough oversaw the origination and closing of over $1.7 billion in equity across more than 100 real estate investments, according to his LinkedIn. He accepted a new position with O’Connor Capital Partners as the head of capital formation.\n\nThe platform has come under pressure from investors because of the Elie Schwartz fiasco. Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz recently pleaded\nguilty\nto one count of wire fraud where Schwartz acknowledged misappropriating $54 million of CrowdStreet investor funds designated for an acquisition of an office complex in Atlanta and a commercial property in Miami Beach. Schwartz faces up to 20 years in prison.\nInvestors have turned their eye on CrowdStreet in light of Schwartz’s guilty plea. A group of about\n125 investors\nin a Nightingale office project in Chicago filed a claim in arbitration demanding CrowdStreet cover $7.2 million in losses, alleging the firm failed to see clear issues with Nightingale and Schwartz, according to Bisnow.\nCrowdStreet has claimed to be a victim of Schwartz’s fraud and alerted authorities about the wrongdoing.\nIn the summer of 2023, an independent manager for investors in Nightingale’s projects announced in a webinar that most of their money had been misappropriated. Schwartz allegedly used that money for personal expenses and other Nightingale projects. He used $12 million of investor funds to bet on First Republic\nbank’s stock\nand options prior to the bank’s seizure by regulators.\nCrowdStreet came under scrutiny because it failed to require Schwartz to hold the money in a designated escrow account.\nCrowdStreet’s long-time CEO\nTore Steen\nleft the firm weeks after the news of the Nightingale scandal broke. Last year, the firm hired John Imbriglia as the CEO who replaced an interim chief executive.\nSparrough did not return a request to comment.\nCorrection\n:\nA previous version of the story\nmisidentified the name of CrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\n.\n",

    "content": "Los Angeles County voters favor building dense apartments in urban areas in exchange for allowing fewer homes in fire-prone areas.\nTo compensate for restricting homebuilding in fire-prone communities, county voters backed greater production of high-density housing in urban areas, with 55 percent in support compared to 30 percent opposed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n, citing a new poll.\nThe poll, conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the newspaper, found that voters favored boosting funding for fire protection, even if it increased their taxes.\nAn overwhelming majority of county voters also supported strengthening building codes and imposing greater restrictions on home construction in high-risk areas after the January firestorm burned more than\n12,000 homes\nbetween Altadena and the Pacific Palisades.\nSome 80 percent of those polled backed tougher building codes to make homes more fire resistant, even if it added costs.\nSeven out of 10 wanted more regulations to curb homebuilding in wildfire-prone neighborhoods.\n“This is a huge event in L.A. history,” Mark DiCamillo, poll director at UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, told the Times. “It’s having a major effect on what people think needs to be done in terms of making housing safer.”\nState and local officials have not decided if there will be any building code changes for homes rebuilt from the fires. Codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones now\nrequire significant measures\n, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires.\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes.\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in L.A. County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas, according to the Times.\nA poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute\nfound 81 percent of city voters\nbacked speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jamestown’s latest investment move in Atlanta gives it a minority stake in a key mixed-use development.\nThe firm acquired a stake in Inman Quarter, which anchors Inman Park, from TriBridge Residential, the Atlanta Business Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe 208,000-square-foot development includes 200 apartments and 40,000 square feet of retail, with restaurants like BeetleCat, MF Sushi and Bread &amp; Butterfly.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction establishes a joint venture with TriBridge, which purchased Inman Quarter for $72.5 million in 2015 alongside Coro Realty Advisors. Coro later sold its stake, leaving TriBridge as the sole owner. At that time, the apartments were 90 percent leased, and the retail was about 85 percent occupied.\nA block from the Atlanta Beltline’s Eastside Trail, Inman quarter has become a popular destination, drawing about 500,000 visitors annually, according to Jamestown, citing property software company Placer.ai.\nJamestown, the firm behind major projects like Ponce City Market and Colony Square, plans to lease out vacant retail spaces and to program events to activate its courtyard.\nAtlanta’s retail market is booming, with a\nrecord-low vacancy\nrate of 3.4 percent, according to Colliers.\n\nDeveloped by JPX Works and South City Partners, Inman Quarter opened over a decade ago, coinciding with the early growth of the Beltline’s Eastside Trail and rising demand for walkable, urban living.\nThe investment reflects a broader strategy in Atlanta, where investors are targeting intown districts for redevelopment.\nRecent deals include Canvas Company’s $6.6 million acquisition of a 17-space portfolio in East Atlanta Village last month and Third &amp; Urban’s $13.75 million acquisition of more than 35,000 square feet at the Virginia-Highlands retail district in December. That deal pencils out to $393 per square foot.\nMeanwhile, New City Properties is\nadvancing its redevelopment\nof the Neuhoff meat-packing plant site, backed by $550 million from JPMorgan and Cousins Properties, adding apartments, office and retail space as part of a significant mixed-use project.\nJamestown has been expanding its footprint in Atlanta. Most recently in August, it\nacquired the local office of North American Properties\n, taking on assets like Colony Square, The Forum Peachtree Corners and Avenue East Cobb.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Condos that went into contract last week had an average price per square foot of $2,277. Single-family contracts last week equated to an average of $1,344 per square foot.\nIn all, last week ended with 22 properties going into contract, totaling $148.2 million in asking dollar volume. That’s up from the slowdown of the past couple weeks, with the prior seven-day period ended March 2\nyielding 13 contracts good for $75.8 million\nin listing price volume.\nWest Hollywood’s\n8899 Beverly residences\nsaw the combined units of 7B/7E go into contract. The property is listed at just under $16 million.\n\nProperty and state records indicate the seller is a San Mateo, Calif.-registered LLC named after the building’s address.\nBrett Oppenheim of Oppenheim Real Estate holds the listing.\nThe property has three bedrooms and five bathrooms across 5,370 square feet, according to the listing. Standouts of the space include panoramic views, 11-foot sliding glass doors, wraparound balconies and over $1 million pumped into upgrades.\nLast week’s second-largest contract based on listing price was another condo, unit 2302 inside The Carlyle.\nColdwell Banker Realty’s\nJade Mills\nand Emanuele Rizzo have the listing located at 10776 West Wilshire Boulevard with a $14.5 million asking price.\nRecords show the unit was last sold in 2014, when Richard and Roselee Benaron bought the property for $7.9 million.\nThe three-bed, five-bath home in L.A.’s Westwood neighborhood is nearly 5,200 square feet and commands a half floor at the building. The unit touts views of the city and ocean, a private elevator, 10- to 12-foot ceilings and a veranda.\n",

    "content": "The push to get public employees back to offices in Chicago is being led by the private sector — and landlords anxious to resuscitate the streets of the Loop aren’t getting much help from City Hall.\nThe Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago is lobbying Mayor Brandon Johnson to take a clearer stance on the subject and the Chicago Loop Alliance is leading by example, having called its staff back to the office five days a week at the start of the year.\nBut there isn’t much political pressure being levied at City Hall, as downtown aldermen are staying quiet for now. Aldermen who represent the Loop — the 42nd Ward’s Brendan Reilly and Lamont Robinson of the 4th Ward — didn’t respond to requests for comment. Alderman Bill Conway, who also represents part of the Loop, declined to comment.\nThat leaves the industry on its own, with Farzin Parang, head of BOMA in Chicago, trying to rally allies by tying the cause to other concerns of the mayor’s constituents. Elsewhere, mayors are taking the lead on the issue. Most recently, San Francisco\nMayor Daniel Lurie\nordered city desk workers to return to the office at least four days per week by April 28.\n“We urge the mayor to promote a downtown return across all sectors and support policies that boost office occupancy, including reducing the reliance on property tax and improving public transit,” Parang said.\nThe impact of any additional in-office days for government workers could be significant. The City of Chicago alone employs about 10,000 people at offices, with many located in the Loop. Cook County has another 9,000 or so desk employees in the city, and the State of Illinois accounts for thousands more.\nExpecting office occupancy to reach pre-pandemic levels in any city is a stretch, but an influx of thousands of more workers on any given day could have a ripple effect on struggling retailers and support multifamily development, industry insiders say.\nA concerted effort by public sector leadership would supplement the private sector’s push, which has notched some gains for the area but leaves plenty of room for improvement, said John Vance of Chicago retail brokerage Stone Street Real Estate.\n“It would be unfair and wrong to blame the struggles of the Loop on just city of Chicago employees or state of Illinois employees who work in Chicago,” he said. “But they are working for an employer who has a vested interest in making sure that the city of Chicago, and therefore the state of Illinois, does well.”\nWhere RTO policies stand now\nOffice policies across all levels of government in Chicago vary and can be subject to any of the dozens of union contracts dictating certain terms for employers. Representatives of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois did not respond to repeated requests for comment about work-from-home policies.\nA representative of Cook County said all county employees must work in office at least three days per week. Employees can, however, request exceptions to the schedule from the human resources chief. The county didn’t return a request for the number of exemptions granted.\nAs of January, government office use in Chicago is at 73 percent of pre-pandemic levels according to an Avison Young analysis.\nWith over 48,000 employees, the federal government is the largest employer in the city of Chicago. But tracking various agencies’ office policies is complicated by the current presidential administration’s expansive effort to lay off workers and cut office space by as much as 50 percent.\n\n“These reductions, including the recent planned disposal of the SEC lease at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, could mean a busier government footprint in Chicago, but also a smaller one,” Avison analyst Sean Boyd said.\nThe LaSalle-Wacker corridor, a retail submarket that includes many government buildings and law firms, is one of the lowest performing in the Loop with a 36 percent retail vacancy rate in 2024, Stone Street Real Estate found.\n“[Retailers] need the streets to have a vibrancy and energy and people feeling good because there is a healthy buzz that people create when they are physically here,” Stone Street Real Estate’s Vance said.\nOther areas of the Loop bordering the West Loop and River North have had a faster recovery.\n“Chicago is recovering very unevenly, and if a segment of office that is concentrated recovers dramatically, it’s going to have a huge immediate impact on that submarket,” said Greg Kirsch, founder of retail brokerage Kirsch Agency.\nSeeking other solutions\nMultifamily development also plays a key role in the Loop’s recovery.\nIncreasing its full-time residents will improve retail traffic on evenings and weekends, create easier commutes for some workers and diversify the tax base, said Rob Karr, CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association.\nKarr’s organization isn’t fully on board with requiring in-office schedules; Stone Street Real Estate recently studied three boutique retail corridors through North Side neighborhoods that are flourishing, with little to no vacancy on stretches of Damen, Southport and Armitage avenues.\n“While it’s important we find ways to bring shoppers and workers back downtown throughout the week, we don’t support in-office mandates as no one approach fits the needs of all employers and employees,” Karr said. “It will take collaboration between the business community and policymakers to find creative ways to make downtown a destination once again.”\nA transformation is already underway. Between 2000 and 2022, the Loop’s population grew by 154 percent, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Meanwhile, the total population of Chicago declined by 6 percent during the same time period.\nIf the city’s plan to subsidize\noffice-to-multifamily conversions on LaSalle Street\nsucceeds, it will add to the Loop’s residential growth trajectory; developer\nMike Reschke\non Wednesday won Chicago City Council approval for the conversion of five floors of vacant former office space at 208 South LaSalle into 168 apartments with up to $26 million in tax increment financing support from the city, one of several such projects moving forward in the area.\n“The ultimate survival of the Loop as an office destination is going to happen because people live there,” Kirsch said. “There are other markets in the country that have less residential use and they’re going to have a harder time recovering.”\n",

    "content": "A law firm lease will bring Hines’ Texas Tower to 99 percent leased.\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors at 845 Texas Avenue, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren’t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills’ Mark O’Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines’\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building’s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city’s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines’ global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn’t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower’s leasing success highlights the “flight-to-quality” trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston’s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Terms of the deal, as well as any brokers involved in the transaction, were not disclosed.\nThe Roya complex is expected to benefit from a tailwind of strong demand, mainly due to its walkable location within central Los Angeles and nearby shopping options, according to Tom Burns, managing director for Affinius.\n“The property has already been well received by the market, and we expect it to continue to perform,” he told CO.\nThe Roya, 3.8 miles west of Downtown Los Angeles, has 157 studios, and one- and two-bedroom apartments. The complex has a resident lounge, coworking areas, a fitness center, karaoke room, pool deck and spa and a roof deck with fire pits.\nJamison Services, founded in 2006 by Dr. David Lee, is among the largest multifamily investors in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Jamison family of companies has $3 billion in assets under management, including 18 million square feet of commercial and medical office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties, according to its website.\nWithin the past year, the firm has hit financial headwinds.\nIn December, a 163,170-square-foot office complex owned by Jamison Properties at 16530 Ventura Boulevard in Encino was\nheaded toward receivership\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nA month earlier, a  $35.4 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan tied to a 340,000-square-foot office building owned by Jamison at 811 Wilshire Boulevard in Downtown was\nsent to special servicing\n, according to\nTRD\n.\nAt the same time, Koreatown’s biggest office landlord\ndefaulted on an $86.5 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\ntied to a 34-story office tower at 3435 Wilshire Boulevard, in Koreatown.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "An offbeat home sale in Deerfield shows there’s always appetite for a slice of something different.\nThe suburb’s famous “pie house,” named for its wedge-shaped design, sold for its $350,000 asking price, $55,000 more than it asked\ntwo years ago\n, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe 1,100-square-foot home gained national fame in August 2020 when a TikToker pointed out its triangular design. It has since earned sporadic media attention, including a shout-out from Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.”\nBuilt in 2003, the home’s unusual shape was a necessity born from its 0.09-acre lot. It initially drew some complaints from neighbors but later became a local curiosity. The house has an unconventional design despite appearing fairly traditional from the front, with its seven windows and a door. A view from the side reveals a wall only 3 feet wide, from which the remaining walls extend outward at an acute angle, like a slice of pie.\nIt was developed by Greg Weissman, then-owner of Advantage Properties, now a broker for @properties Christie’s International Real Estate in Northbrook. It has finally hit above the $325,000 price point\nWeissman hoped to sell it for in 2003\n.\nIt hit the market in September, finding a buyer just two days later.\n\nThe buyer was Tanaka Littlepaige, a manager at the world’s largest derivatives exchange, Chicago-based CME Group, according to county records.\nThe seller was Abigail Drazner, an operations project manager at insurance and financial services firm Alera Group, who bought the home in 2020. For a few months in 2020 it was listed as a short-term rental, offering free pizza for the first booker.\nTed Pickus and Lisa Schulkin had the listing, and Beth Wexler represented Littlepaige, all agents with @properties Christie’s.\nThe two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom house includes 9-foot ceilings, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and a paver brick walkway. It also features a storage shed and a parking pad that accommodates up to four cars, though it lacks a garage. The home has one bedroom upstairs and another in the basement.\nThe property has changed hands multiple times over the years, with the latest sale price comfortably topping its 2021 price of $295,000. Previous sale prices included $300,000 in 2004, $284,500 in 2007, and $260,000 in 2020. Its property taxes for 2023 were $8,014.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Horton picked up a 30-acre parcel along Davis Road in League City, according to a news release from Colliers.\nThe seller was Houston-based Broad Reach Capital, deed records show. Colliers’ Chris Hutcheson, Harrison Kane and James Kadlick represented Broad Reach Capital.\nThe purchase came on the heels of a\ntender offer\nfrom Forestar. The company offered shareholders cash to purchase outstanding 3.85 percent senior notes due. Forestar received offers for 83 percent of the notes, amounting to $329.4 million.\nOther big names in development have also been turning dirt for single-family development in League City.\nHillwood Communities started construction on Legacy by Hillwood, between Interstate 45 and FM 528, a year ago. It was the Dallas-based developer’s third community in the Houston area.\n\nAt full build-out, the 805-acre community will feature 1,600 homes, an elementary school and amenities like pools, a recreation center and launch areas for kayaks and paddleboards.\nLike other far-flung suburbs of major Texas cities, League City is experiencing a wave of growth. In 15 years, its population has nearly tripled to 122,000 people; 40 percent of the city is still undeveloped.\nThe city is preparing for an influx of development with drainage improvements to address flooding and by upgrading the League City waterline, which comes from Houston.\nForestar sold more than 15,000 residential lots last year. The company operates in 24 states, according to its website, but its focus is on communities in the Sunbelt. D. R. Horton acquired a majority stake in Forestar in 2017.\n",

Brokers Michael Haenel, Andy Markham and Phil Haenel of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented EQT Exeter.\nThe renter will use the two-year-old building for warehousing and distribution across the western U.S.\nIn August, Kenco and a division of British Petroleum won\npermission to store petroleum products\nat a 168,000-square-foot facility in Surprise, about 22 miles northwest of Phoenix.\nIn April, EQT Exeter bought the Buckeye warehouse now known as I-10 Gateway for $60.1 million, or $94 per square foot.\nThe Southwest Valley’s industrial submarket “is really, really favorable and attracting a lot of high-quality, national tenants,” Scott Guo, investment and leasing officer for EQT Exeter, told the Business Journal.\n\nHe said large firms such as Kenco are looking to either relocate from California’s Inland Empire, the heart of the Western U.S. industrial distribution market, or are looking to expand their footprints.\nProximity to California ports was “really important for these guys,” Guo said, while the Buckey warehouse’s direct access to Interstate 10 was a “very, very big competitive advantage when they were weighing other buildings that they could have otherwise leased.”\nAcross all submarkets, the Southwest Valley outside Phoenix had the\nmost industrial square footage\ncompleted or under construction in the fourth quarter, according to CBRE.\nSome 87 percent of the 3.2 million square feet of industrial warehouses completed last quarter was in the southwest region. At the same time, 9.7 million square feet were under construction, or 61 percent of the 15.9 million square feet being built across greater Phoenix.\nEQT Exeter, founded in 2006 as Exeter Property Group, has more than $30 billion in assets under management, including more than 2,000 properties and 375 million square feet of warehouses, office and life sciences buildings and homes, according to its website.\nIn early 2021, Swedish private equity manager EQT AB acquired Exeter Property Group and renamed it EQT Exeter, which serves as its real estate arm.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The owners of scores of torched homes from Altadena to the Pacific Palisades are cashing out.\nA forecast landslide of listings related to the January firestorms that burned more than\n12,000 homes\nin Los Angeles County has picked up speed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nIn late January, the first vacant lot was put up for sale in Altadena. Then more than a dozen lots were listed last month in the Pacific Palisades for\nbetween $2 million and $8 million\n, with the first lot closing at $1.2 million.\nNow the floodgates appear to have opened, according to the Times. Owners of blackened lots are increasingly choosing to sell rather than slog through the time-consuming and costly task of rebuilding.\n“There [are] so many to choose from,” Jeremy Hardy, a broker with Craig Estates &amp; Fine Properties, told the Times.\nAs of early Monday, there were 49 burned lots listed in Pacific Palisades, and 32 up for sale in Altadena, according to Zillow.\nThe reasons for choosing to sell are varied, real estate agents say. Some owners don’t think they have the money to rebuild, while others are aging and don’t want their last years tied up with construction.\n\nSome with rental properties concluded that keeping them wasn’t worth the hassle.\nMost of those interested in acquiring the burned lots are developers, agents say. Builders generally have the cash to buy vacant land. They can also put up with time, aggravation and costs associated with construction.\n“Building a house is one of the most complex and highly regulated activities you possibly can engage in,” Brock Harris, a Keller Williams agent with the first scorched lot listing in Altadena, which sold to a builder, told the Times.\nA rush by developers could help neighborhoods build back quicker.\nThey’re also raising concerns about gentrification and whether longtime owners are getting a fair price for their lots. In\nmiddle-class Altadena\n, residents proclaimed, “Altadena is not for sale.”\nAt least eight burned lots have been sold in the area with most selling for between $500,000 and $600,000, according to Zillow. Agents said the lots are going for two-thirds of what the typical land fetched before the fire.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which walked away rather than pay the tab for the beleaguered Westfield San Francisco Centre mall, wants to sell the office buildings next door for housing.\nThe French conglomerate is about to list the 77,000-square-foot building at 814 Mission Street and the 28,000-square-foot building at 818 Mission Street near Union Square for an undisclosed price,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNearly 20 years ago, Westfield bought the side-by-side buildings between Jessie and Fourth streets for a combined $42 million, or $400 per square foot.\nThe vacant buildings are set to hit the market this month, and could sell for less than half their last traded price. Recent office sales in the area have reset the market at between\n$100 to $200 per square foot\n.\n“Pricing will be in line with other office buildings that have recently sold in Mid-Market,” broker Darren Kuiper of Colliers, working to sell the buildings for Westfield, told the Chronicle. The  listing is shared by brokers Tony Crossley and Robert Gilley of Colliers, and Bruce Carlson of Kennedy Wilson.\nKuiper said Westfield hired Chicago-based SOM to evaluate the combined sites for redevelopment into housing, saying that under current density bonus laws, a 365-foot tower with 400 units was possible.\nBrokers said the Mission Street buildings can be sold separately or together and could be paired with the former Westfield mall next door,\nnow operated by a receiver\n. Its foreclosure auction was\ncanceled last month\nand is now slated for March 27.\nIt was in June 2023 that Paris-based Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and New York-based Brookfield Properties abandoned the city’s largest mall rather than pay its $558 million mortgage loan.\n\nThe owners of the nine-story, 1.5 million-square-foot mall with 170 stores at 865 Market Street pointed to a plunge in shoppers and sales post-pandemic.\nAt the same time, Seattle-based Nordstrom was poised to pull out of the half-empty mall, citing “unsafe conditions” for leaving a\n312,000-square-foot\nhole.\nThe part of downtown surrounding the mall has been\nchallenged\nwith quality-of-life and safety issues in the wake of the pandemic. A Denny’s on the ground floor of 818 Mission for nearly two decades\nclosed last year\n, adding to its vacant storefronts.\nA purchase of the vacant offices owned by Westfield would be a long-term play, brokers say.\nDespite the area’s challenges, it has “a lot of great infrastructure,” Carlson of Kennedy Wilson told the Chronicle, highlighting nearby parking, bus and BART stations, museums and the Moscone Convention Center. “The bones are there.”\n“The question is, are people OK with grabbing a big site like this and then waiting?” Kuiper of Colliers posed to the newspaper. “Because it may take five-plus years for the development world to come back, maybe longer.\n“But there are not a lot of high-rise opportunities in this kind of location with the ability for the builder to go really tall and do housing.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A headquarters tenant at downtown Houston’s newest office building is investing in its lease.\nLaw firm Hicks Johnson is spending $4.3 million to build out its 17,500-square-foot space at the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nSkanska delivered the building last year; it was previously known as 1550 on the Green. It is the first major office building to open downtown since\nHines’ Texas Tower\nin 2021.\nHicks Johnson signed for a 13-year lease on the 19th floor of the tower in September. The buildout — including offices, meeting rooms and a mock courtroom — will begin this summer and wrap in the fall. Houston-based Kirksey Architecture is designing the space with O’Donnell/Snider Construction as general contractor.\nThe 28-story building is 50 percent leased between Hicks Johnson, Norton Rose Fulbright and\nBoston Consulting Group\n. The remaining space is being marketed to tenants looking for modern, amenity-rich office environments downtown.\n\nThe building has 375,000 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. It features three landscaped terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with lounge areas, a bar and conference space.\nThe move aligns with the firm’s plan to double its headcount from 20 to 40 lawyers over the next five years, Managing Partner Andrew Hicks said.\nThe firm is exiting TC Energy Center, at 700 Louisiana Street, whose ownership includesM-M Properties and an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust. It was built in 1983, and buildings of that era contribute the largest share of vacancy in Houston. Buildings constructed in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s average about 30 percent vacant, while those built since 2010 have an average vacancy under 14 percent as tenants seek new buildings with amenities to attract workers.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A megalisting priced at $175 million has hit the market in what’s been a drawn-out saga for a piece of Benedict Canyon once slated for a\nBulgari-branded hotel\n.\nThe 15-parcel listing includes the 9712 West Oak Pass Road address among several others in the hillside of Los Angeles. The listing states the property is located in Beverly Hills Post Office, a Los Angeles neighborhood north of the city of Beverly Hills. It also includes two single-family residences at 9800 Wanda Park Drive and 2534 Hutton Drive.\nRecords through PropertyShark and listing sites note the property is in pre-foreclosure after a notice of default was sent in November, alleging a $49.7 million unpaid balance at that time.\nThe notice of default indicates Motcomb Estates Ltd. provided a $30 million loan to 9712 Oak Pass Road LLC, which Florida state records show is tied to developer Gary Safady.\nMotcomb handles property investments for real estate investment and development firm Reuben Brothers, which is helmed by billionaires David and Simon Reuben.\nThe Agency’s Adam Rosenfeld and Feroz Taj have the listing and declined, through a brokerage spokesperson, to comment on the property outside of confirming only one seller is involved. Also marketing the property is Compass’ Carl Gambino.\nDavid Reuben Jr., Reuben Brothers principal and co-founder of Blackship Advisors, declined to comment. The Reubens’ attorney, Eric Orenstein of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, did not respond for comment.\nLuxe Ambitions\nThe mega-property was a point of contention a few years ago when Safady planned for a Bulgari-branded hotel.\nAn initial study for the project, when it was known as The Retreat at Benedict Canyon, called for a 59-room hotel along with eight single-family residences. The latter were to each total anywhere from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet, according to city planning documents.\nThe project drew the ire of some locals who were against the expected impacts of the large-scale construction project.\n\n“I believe we’ve taken the time to address all those issues,” Safady, who could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday, told\nVoyageLA\nin April 2023.\nA few months after that interview ran, then-\nCity Planning Director Vincent Bertoni\nwrote to Safady that the project’s impact to the area was far greater than originally expected, effectively ending the entitlement process for the resort.\nMike Gatto, an attorney for Safady, told the\nLos Angeles Times\nfollowing the city’s decision to axe the project it sent “a message to all looking to invest in Los Angeles that the city can’t be trusted to follow its own rules.”\nGatto, reached Tuesday afternoon, said he wasn’t aware of any backup development plans following the city’s 2023 decision, which is when his retainer agreement with Safady ended.\n“Usually when there is a presence of a NIMBY group in an area, they make it so that whatever somebody proposes is going to be tough. Those factors would have made it very hard to build anything there,” Gatto told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPricey Properties\nOak Pass Road now ranks as the third-priciest property on the market within Los Angeles County, according to Zillow records.\nThe county’s most expensive property currently for sale is Westside Estate Agency’s listing at 1261 Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills, which has a $195 million price tag. WEA founders Kurt Rappaport and Stephen Shapiro are marketing the property.\nAngelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, gets its name from Hyatt Hotel heir Anthony Pritzker who built the 50,000-square-foot mega mansion with his now ex-wife Jeanne Pritzker. It has 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\nThe next priciest property on the market is 607 Siena Way, which is priced at $177 million by The Beverly Hills Estates’ Branden Williams and Rayni Williams. The eight-bed, 25-bath Villa Siena estate spans 35,000 square feet and hit the market in February.\n",

    "content": "The owners of a Newport Beach apartment complex by the Back Bay want to expand it by 366 units — at $800,000 a pop.\nDallas-based Park Newport LP has filed plans to expand its Park Newport Apartments at 1 Park Newport,\nthe Orange County Business Journal reported.\nThe 1,306-unit complex on 52 acres would expand by 366 apartments at a cost of $800,000 each. The total outlay: $293 million.\nThe sprawling complex along the bluffs of Upper Newport Bay sits across Jamboree Road from the Fashion Island mall. The complex, built a half century ago by Gerson Bakar &amp; Associates, has 44 two- and three-story buildings, plus seven pools, a clubhouse and 10 sport courts.\nResidents of Park Newport have included actors Telly Savalas and Raquel Welch, and athletes Joe Torre, Bobby Riggs and Dennis Rodman.\nThe property is now owned by San Francisco-based Prado Group, according to the Business Journal. It’s not clear how Park Newport, or a Park Newport Land it said was involved in the expansion, are tied.\nPlans for the 6-acre expansion call for demolishing a leasing building, reflecting pool, tennis court and a 260-vehicle parking structure, as well as six apartments.\nThe landlord would then build 360 new apartments, including 285 market-rate units and 15 set aside for low-income tenants. The other 60 new apartments are “density bonus” residences, an indication of affordable housing units, according to the Business Journal.\n\nThe project would include 40 studio, 138 one-bedroom, 151 two-bedroom and 31 three-bedroom apartments, with an average size of 950 square feet. It would also include a 12,000-square-foot amenity space and 7,000 square feet of shops.\nThe expansion of the largest apartment complex near Fashion Island is the latest development among other multifamily projects in the works.\nLocally based Irvine Company recently proposed a combined 800 apartment units at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and Newport Center’s Block 100, a four-building multifamily project at 11 Newport Center Drive.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for very low-income and low-income households.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Los Angeles may soon lower the cost of building apartments by allowing just one single stairway.\nCouncil member Nithya Raman filed a motion to scrub requirements for double stairwells and dual-loaded corridors as early 20th century planning relics that prevent larger, family-sized apartments with more natural ventilation and light,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n.\nLos Angeles, like many cities, requires buildings higher than three stories to have two stairwells that can be used as fire exits.\nThe code requirement forces architects to design buildings around a double-loaded corridor, or long central hallways with apartments on either side, similar to a hotel.\nThe requirement also requires a hallway connecting the stairwells, resulting in dual-loaded corridor buildings that limit the size of apartments and allow windows only one side, preventing natural sunlight and cross-ventilation.\nSuch corridor design is inefficient and costly, opponents say. They claim a fire exit on a centrally located stair, as practiced in Europe, is a far more manageable and “economically defensible” design.\n\nWhile common practice in European cities,\nSeattle has led the charge on single-stair reform\nin the U.S. Decades ago, the city tweaked its building code to allow for single-stair buildings up to six stories.\nWhile New York followed suit, Raman pointed out that\nSan Francisco\nand San Diego are also exploring single-stair rules after the passage of\nAssembly Bill 835\n, which directs the state fire marshal to develop standards for single-stair buildings by 2028.\nRaman’s motion seeks numerous reports on a single-stair regulation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department and the Planning Department, as well as the Livable Cities Initiatives and the American Institute of Architects.\nLikewise, the motion asks the Planning Department to report back on existing regulations in cities where single-stair buildings are allowed.\n“While the requirement for two stairwells was originally adopted for fire safety, developments over the past two to three decades have made such requirements obsolete,” explains\na landing page on the California YIMBY website\n. “Modern buildings across the U.S. and Europe have fire safety ratings that greatly exceed buildings with two staircases — even though they only have one staircase.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Lafayette, a city of $2 million homes, has played a shell game with state housing regulators to avoid building its share of affordable housing.\nThat’s the contention of the Housing Action Coalition, a San Francisco-based housing advocate that is suing the East Bay city for creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nThe coalition accuses the city of “pretending” to comply with the planning blueprint, known as the housing element, required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint filed by Farella Braun and Martel a San Francisco-based law firm.\nIn one case, the city said a CVS will be torn down and rebuilt into 26 homes — but CVS has a long-term lease, with no intention of moving, according to the lawsuit. Other examples were not disclosed.\n“We hoped that Lafayette would take its responsibility to plan for housing seriously, but instead, they passed a housing element that deliberately ignores the facts,” Ali Sapirman, the advocacy and policy manager with the Housing Action Coalition, told the Chronicle. “Lafayette is continuing a pattern of obstruction, using questionable calculations to block much-needed housing while pretending to comply with state law.\n“The housing crisis is severe, and every city, including Lafayette, must do its fair share,” Sapirman added.\n\nIn its housing plan, Lafayette proposed using city-owned parking lots for housing, as well as sites downtown and at religious institutions to build affordable housing. The city projects that 27 accessory dwelling units will be built each year, for a total of 216 units.\nOfficials also said more than 150 units were under construction, with another 570 approved units in the development pipeline.\nThe city didn’t immediately return a request for comment by the newspaper.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group attempting to stop the development, allowing it to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019 — according to its housing element plan.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",
