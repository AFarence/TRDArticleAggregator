    "content": "As Steve Witkoff dives deeper into the diplomatic world, he’s pulling back on his real estate ties.\nThe business man and President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East\ndisclosed to Bloomberg\nthat he’s in the process of divesting from the Witkoff Group and World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency platform co-founded by Alex and Zach Witkoff. Alex has already assumed day-to-day responsibilities of the development firm, which Steve founded almost 30 years ago.\nWhen Witkoff joined the administration, ethics questions quickly followed considering how much of his business can be tied to places all over the world. In divesting from his firm and crypto assets, Witkoff is hoping to be judged on his diplomatic results going forward.\n“How do you ensure you’re not using the special envoy role to skew policy your way?” Harold Hongju Koh, a former legal adviser to the State Department, told Bloomberg.\nWitkoff and Trump were already enmeshed, business-wise. Both of their families have stakes in World Liberty Financial. Witkoff was also an investor in Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover; Musk leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency today.\nNow Witkoff is following Trump’s lead by installing progeny atop a real estate company when entering the political fray, though ethics questions about Trump’s businesses continue to linger.\n\nFederal ethics law mandates senior Cabinet officials divest individual stock holdings and assets that could bring about conflict of interest concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is divesting his business interests, recently\nnaming one of his sons\nas the chair of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nWitkoff’s fortune is estimated to be around $782 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though one person familiar with his finances suggested it could be double that.\nWitkoff has been especially busy internationally during the first couple of months of Trump’s second administration, and even before then, despite his lack of diplomatic experience. He helped negotiate the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He also\nmet with Russian president Vladimir Putin\nlast month and will soon do so again.\nIn some ways, he’s following in the footsteps laid out by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Ivanka Trump’s husband jumped from real estate to politics — negotiating the Abraham Accords — before jumping back into business. Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, counts $4.6 billion in assets, essentially all\nfrom foreign investors\n.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "A developer scored a $53.5 million construction loan for a 250-unit apartment complex in Boynton Beach, amid a multifamily supply overhang in South Florida.\nTM Real Estate Group plans the Shalimar at Boynton Beach project with 10 three-story and four-story buildings, a nearly 10,000-square-foot clubhouse and 4,300 square feet of retail in two additional buildings at 3570 West Boynton Beach Boulevard, according to a city commission meeting agenda from 2022, when the project was approved.\nCharlotte, North Carolina-based Truist Bank is the lender of the construction loan.\nTM Real Estate, based in Coconut Grove, paid $16 million for the 12.5-acre development site in 2021, records show.\nFounded in 2005, TM is a development, investment and management firm focused on South Florida multifamily and mixed-use properties, according to its website. Matthew Pellar is CEO of TM.\n\nIts portfolio includes the 240-unit Shalimar at Davie complex at 4901 Shalimar Lane in Davie, and the 240-unit Shalimar at Plantation West at 8500 Cleary Boulevard in Plantation.\nIn 2021, TM sold the Lincoln Square office complex consisting of a pair of five-story buildings at  18405 Northwest Second Avenue in Miami Gardens for\n$15.4 million\n.\nSouth Florida’s multifamily market has slowed compared to the boom years of 2021 and 2022 when the tri-county region experienced an influx of out-of-state residents and record rent hikes. After developers seized on the bonanza, they completed a record 18,600 units last year, outpacing 15,000 in new leases, according to CoStar Group data. This led to\nslower lease-ups and increased concessions\n. Median monthly rent hit $2,328 in January, down nearly 2 percent, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nDemand could catch up to supply late this year or next year, partly due to a drop in construction starts, experts said.\nConstruction loans\nhave flowed, including for multifamily projects. Last month, White Oak Development scored\n$67 million\nto build a pair of four-story buildings with 286 apartments at 4181 and 4233 Davie Road in Davie. That came on the heels of the Caltagirone brothers’ Calta Group scoring a\n$53.7 million\nconstruction loan for 251 apartments in two Hollywood projects, at 2750 Van Buren Street, and at 2217-2239 Jackson Street.\n",

    "content": "A Fort Worth power player made changes at the top.\nCrescent Real Estate named Conrad Suszynski as its sole CEO following the retirement of co-CEO Jason Anderson, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nSuszynski steps into the role after almost 20 years at the company. He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff — Chairman John Goff’s son — to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent’s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm’s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas — a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components — and the Robert L. Crandall corporate campus for American Airlines in Fort Worth.\nIts development activity is also expanding. Crescent is advancing a\nsecond office tower in Fort Worth\n, constructing the 30-story, 215-unit\nCrescent Point Tower\nin Uptown Dallas and preparing to open a 31-story\nluxury apartment building\nat 2811 Maple in May, where rents start at $4,000 a month.\nIt recently started development on its 92-home\nhigh-end housing project in Horseshoe Bay\nnear Marble Falls, northwest of Austin. Groundwork and infrastructure at the 114-acre site is expected to be completed in March 2026.\nSuszynski said the company is deepening its focus on high-quality development, particularly in Uptown Dallas and Fort Worth, where Crescent is looking to cultivate environments that mirror the success of its flagship properties.\nThe leadership team has an average tenure of over 12 years, Suszynski said.\n",

    "content": "Gary Barnett is getting a big assist on notable Manhattan developments from the Israeli markets.\nExtell Development scored or agreed to multiple financing deals solicited on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Bisnow\nreported\n. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on either debt deal.\nFirst, Extell entered into a memorandum of intent with an unnamed bank to provide as much as $1.3 billion in financing for The Torch, a supertall mixed-use hotel at 740 Eighth Avenue in Times Square. The financing would include a senior construction loan and mezzanine debt, according to a Feb. 25 filing with the exchange and translated through Google.\nExtell also signed a letter of intent with an unnamed hotel chain. The operator would invest in construction and provide a guarantee that could help Barnett secure another $150 million in mezzanine debt.\nWork is already underway on the 1,067-foot-tall hotel, which will span 875,000 square feet and include 825 rooms. The most notable — and\ncontroversial\n— feature is a 300-foot transparent tube that will contain a drop ride, which has already passed the Department of Buildings’ muster.\nConstruction is expected to take four and a half years.\nThe developer also attempted to raise roughly $299.4 million from TASE bondholders to refinance 18 unsold condominium units at Central Park Tower. Barnett didn’t hit that number, but came close\nwith a $270 million closing\n, according to an offering report translated with Google.\n\nThe collateral features a first lien on the 18 sponsor units at 217 West 57th Street. As of the end of last year, the units were valued at more than $557 million combined, according to an investor presentation.\nExtell previously landed a $500 million inventory loan from JPMorgan Chase and the Reuben Brothers in 2023, which was secured by 87 apartments.\nBarnett has been forced to accept discounted deals at the world’s tallest residential building. As of late December, 114 sponsor sales recorded in an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nhave sold\nfor a combined $1.8 billion\n, 25 percent less than the $2.4 billion in total volume listing in the project’s original offering plan for those units.\nSales launched in 2018 for the building’s 178 units.\nIn case Barnett didn’t seem busy enough, Extell just\nsnapped up three buildings\nnext to his planned Madison Avenue residential tower from Sol Goldman’s Solil Management for $103 million.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Las Vegas Sands’ vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city’s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino — pending state legalization — as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands’\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban’s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\n\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project’s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to “ongoing engagement and collaboration,” spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "If you’re in the business of writing about Albany making things worse for the real estate industry and all New Yorkers, you never run out of material.\nRecently I wrote about Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposal to crack down on an\nentirely nonexistent problem\n: large investors cornering the market on single-family and two-family homes in New York.\nGovernors are supposed to be the adults in the room — executives with a broad purview who can stop the wackiest bills advanced by clueless or ideological legislators.\nIn this case, Hochul did the opposite: Her plan was like dangling crack cocaine in front of a drug-addicted legislature.\nPredictably, the Assembly and Senate\nsmoked that rock\nand came back for a much larger hit, as my colleague Kathryn Brenzel reported Wednesday.\nSenate Democrats’ formal 2025 agenda includes the\nEnd Hedge Fund Control of New York Homes Act\n, a truly Orwellian name because hedge funds do not control homes in New York. How can you end something that has not even started, probably never will, and even if it did, wouldn’t necessarily be bad?\nThe bill covers homes with up to four units, instead of Hochul’s two. Even more extreme, it slaps a\n50 percent tax\non investor purchases of homes. That is the equivalent of a ban. It’s probably unconstitutional and is definitely bad policy.\n\nMost investors who buy, renovate and flip (or rent out) houses are mom-and-pops, the kind of folks who have become popular on HGTV. You’d think state lawmakers would want to encourage this kind of thing, especially now that\nrenting is more economical than buying\nin every metro area in the U.S., as a LendingTree analysis found.\nYet the Assembly defines an institutional investor as anyone with a net worth of $5 million or more. That means if you own a townhouse in the city, or just have a co-op and a decent-sized 401(k), the Assembly would impose a 10 percent tax on your next home purchase.\nChances are, you wouldn’t even be able to make an offer: The Assembly’s\nagenda\nalso calls for not allowing sellers to receive bids for 90 days from potential buyers who have $5 million to their names.\nJust imagine an agent telling an affluent home shopper, “I cannot share your offer with the seller because the state legislature defines you as a hedge fund.”\nYou cannot make this stuff up. And there’s no need to, because politicians provide an endless stream of senseless ideas.\nThe vast majority of bills do not pass, but this one actually might because the governor, Assembly and Senate each have a version of it in their budget proposals.\nThe days of “three men in a room” are technically over, because now two of the three leaders are women. What Albany really needs in the room is at least one adult.\n",

    "content": "Six years after allegedly trashing a vacant property it intended to buy for $10.7 million, the city of Doral will pay the landowner nearly double the originally agreed purchase price.\nOn Wednesday, the\nDoral\nCity Council approved a settlement agreement that will pay Doral 10, an entity managed by Lizbeth Arencibia of Hialeah Gardens, $21 million to drop a 2019 civil lawsuit in Miami federal court. The settlement includes $17 million to buy the 9.6-acre site, with the remainder paying for Doral 10’s losses from not being able to use the property and attorney fees, said Raul Gastesi, a private lawyer representing the city.\nArencibia is the daughter of the late\nLowell Dunn\n, a developer whose family members are among the largest landowners in northwest\nMiami-Dade County\n. The 9.6 acres are between Northwest 102nd Avenue and 104th Avenue just north of 68th Street.\n“The market has changed dramatically since [the lawsuit was filed],” Gastesi told the city council. “And we were not doing well in court. [Doral 10] has not been able to develop the land or do anything on the land due to contamination that they allege we caused.”\nDoral 10’s attorney, Alejandro Brito, did not respond to requests for comment. The property owner sought $30 million in damages when Doral 10 initially filed its complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The lawsuit was transferred to federal court, where the city won a dismissal in 2020, court records show. The ruling was overturned on appeal in 2023.\n\nThe lawsuit also named three contractors, JVA Engineering Contractor, EE&amp;G Environmental Services and BBC Engineering, as defendants. But Doral 10 voluntarily dismissed the counts against the three firms, which were hired by\nDoral\n, court records show.\nBetween January and May 2019, the city and its trio of contractors used the site as a staging area for a roadway project without Doral 10’s consent, the complaint alleges. Yet, city officials allegedly “falsely and knowingly represented” to JVA and Miami-Dade County’s environmental permitting department that they had obtained the property owner’s permission.\nDoral 10 also accused JVA of taking clean fill from the vacant site to recycle contaminated soil that was excavated for the roadway project. The contractor then deposited contaminated soil mixed with clean fill onto Doral 10’s property, the lawsuit states.\nFour months into using the site as a staging area and without informing Doral 10, city officials informed the property owner that a required environmental remediation of the land would cost a minimum of $2.8 million, according to the complaint. As a result,\nDoral\nofficials opted to terminate the deal to buy the land, which the city planned to convert into a park.\nGastesi provided city council members with a grim outlook if Doral took the case to trial. “I would rather recommend you purchase the land rather than pay the damages,” he said. “The court is likely to find against Doral.”",

    "content": "Voucher recipients across Illinois are struggling to find housing as challenges in subsidized housing programs grow, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nMost subsidies come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients to pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent while local housing authorities cover the rest.\nYet many recipients are unable to lease units due to hurdles including landlords\nrefusing to accept vouchers\n, often due to discrimination, and a lack of inventory.\nThe Chicago Housing Authority’s lease-up rates fell to 31 percent last year, down from 45 percent in 2023. The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color — two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the “real urban experience of living in San Francisco,” which he didn’t associate with the city’s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, “eyes wide open,” buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n“No surprises,” he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. “We knew everything—all the good and the challenges that we were in for—and saw some real improvements along the way.”\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it’s “impossible to replicate what’s been done here,” according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it’s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n“You really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,” he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is “baked in” to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n“Not everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,” said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk’s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn’t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today’s “value-driven buyer.”\n“We wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,” Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The “perfect fit” would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women’s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has “flirted with” the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can’t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n“They want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,” he said.\nThat’s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n“It’s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,” he said. “It was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.”\n",

    "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder’s remedy.  And now La Cañada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Cañada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n“Continuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,” Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Cañada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder’s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder’s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Cañada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder’s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n“The message is: stop playing games with housing,” Leaderman said. “There’s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.”\nDespite the city’s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder’s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n“The City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,” Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n“The ball’s in their court,” Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Both of the leases were signed last month and originally disclosed in a CBRE report.\nMasterworks agreed to lease 37,000 square feet on the 57th Floor of 1 World Trade Center, which is owned by the Durst Organization and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The deal is in the form of a sublease from mortgage lender Network Capital and comes as Masterworks looks to exit its office space at Brookfield Properties’ 225 Liberty Street.\nAt 3 World Trade Center, Uber took an additional 44,000 square feet at the Silverstein Properties building. The rideshare company already occupies 300,000 square feet, which it started to utilize in 2019.\nBut by the next year, during the height of the pandemic, Uber reversed course and reportedly offered about 80,000 square feet\nfor sublease\n.\n\nFinancial details of the leases were not disclosed.\nFebruary was a major month for office leases in Lower Manhattan. Tenants leased 864,000 square feet in the district in February, according to CBRE, more than doubling the leasing volume in the area for the entire fourth quarter.\nOn the whole, Manhattan’s office leasing volume was down\nabout 13 percent month-over-month\nin February to 3.2 million square feet after a big January, according to a monthly Colliers report. Leasing velocity increased by 38 percent year-over-year and demand was 19 percent above the ten-year monthly average.\nThe availability rate tightened to the lowest level since March 2021, while sublet availability decreased to its lowest level since September 2020.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary’s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create “permanently affordable units in the City’s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,” according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager’s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city’s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city’s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC’s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in “good condition” and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD “seized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco”. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot  “offers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.”\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That’s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, “With its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.”\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers’ agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin. At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni’s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

    "content": "From the depths of delinquency, RXR and SL Green have emerged with a workout.\nThe sponsors on the $940 million mortgage backed by Worldwide Plaza, an office behemoth at 825 Eighth Avenue, locked down new terms on a deal that landed in special servicing late last year, according to a Morningstar Credit Newsflash released Thursday morning.\nThe modification let the borrowers, which also include a subsidiary of the liquidating company for the now-dissolved\nNew York REIT\n, use loan reserves to fund operating expenses and debt service shortfalls, according to Morningstar.\nThere is no mention of an extension; the loan comes due in November 2027, according to Morningstar.\nRXR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSL Green in a statement described Worldwide Plaza as an “iconic” asset with an “exceptional block of space” at the top that would draw demand as availability for those layouts “continues to tighten”\n“The mortgage loan is current and the existing reserves service the present needs of the property while we develop a robust repositioning plan,” the firm added.\n\nThe sponsors on Worldwide Plaza ran into trouble when its tenant, law firm Cravath, Swain &amp; Moore, left its office space, depleting nearly half of the building’s rent roll and one-third of its tenant roster.\nAhead of the exit, the building had already lost one-third of its\nvalue\n, according to an Evercore ISI report that cited an implied value of $1.2 billion.\nThe law firm’s departure last August triggered a cash trap provision that froze $22.4 million in reserves set aside for tenant improvements, including renovations or leasing incentives.\n$20 million of that money was instead applied to financial shortfalls, Morningstar details, as the $22.4 million in reserves is now $1.9 million.\nThe workout comes about a month after SL Green and RXR\nlost\na suit with\nNew York REIT\nthat denied the firms access to a $90 million pot of reserves. The money had been set aside to help lease the Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore vacancy; but the parties squabbled over the contract language, and a New York judge ultimately sided with the REIT.\nAs of October, the building was about\n68 percent leased.\nThis article has been updated with a comment from SL Green.\n",

    "content": "A Grayslake-based real estate company whose manager reportedly paid an unhoused Chicagoan to take over the deeds of run-down properties it picked up in bulk and later sought to offload has become the latest target of the city.\nThe company, Goldmine Investments, and another Hinsdale-based investor, QCD Financial, follow a pattern of owners being pursued by a city task force that’s designed to pin down Chicago’s most indebted landowners. Both firms are alleged large-scale “land speculators” that bought up heavily distressed properties, often vacant lots, purchasing them under the names of various LLCs used to muddy the ownership of the properties, according to complaints filed by the city in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThey collectively owe $9 million in fines to the city from municipal code violations related to neglect and environmental hazards at their properties, which are predominantly concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods on the South and West sides of the city.\nThis is when “land speculation becomes problematic,” the city said in the case brought against QCD.\nFor its most negligent landowners, the Chicago Department of Law’s special collections unit is moving to consolidate judgements made against owners in city administrative hearings into lawsuits filed with the Circuit Court — as it did for QCD, Goldmine and\ninfamous Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson\nin recent months. The city recently reached a tentative, $11.5 million settlement agreement with Wilson to resolve an estimated $49 million in legal claims it brought against her and her companies.\nAfter bringing down Wilson, the city “seized an opportunity once we learned that there was an individual — individuals — who are accumulating property in a particularly unique way around these title structures that allow them to constantly change the titles without anyone in the city or the county noticing that was happening,” Chicago’s top lawyer Mary Richardson-Lowry said.\nNow, the unit is doing more research to track ownership and moving aggressively when they can bring legal action against the people behind the landlord LLCs — and officials are open to seeking to freeze personal assets in some circumstances as a “motivator,” said the city’s deputy attorney David Holtkamp, who runs the unit.\nNext on the city’s list of troubling landowners: Grayslake resident Keith Moll, the manager of Goldmine, according to court filings and business registry information.\nDigging into Goldmine\nThe city says that Goldmine owns hundreds of properties in Chicago and is just “one of many shell companies created by (Moll) to hold title to real estate in distressed neighborhoods.” Goldmine allegedly owes the city over $5.2 million in fines from more than 1,500 counts of blight-related code violations, according to city litigation.\nThis is not the first time that an LLC managed by Moll has been sued by the city, according to a\nChicago Tribune report from 2015\n. The city sued Z Financial Illinois G Properties, LLC a decade ago to force the company to repair, demolish or cover the cost of demolishing unsafe structures on its properties.\nShortly thereafter, Moll transferred ownership of several of the properties to an unhoused man named Abana Tabb, who told the newspaper Moll paid him to take the five properties.\n“(He said) ‘I wanna dump a couple of houses on you. Don’t worry about it. You’re not gonna get in trouble, blah, blah, blah … sign here,’” Tabb told the newspaper.\nAs a result, Tabb was added as a defendant in the city’s cases against the properties and Z Financial was let off the hook in nearly every case. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office later investigated the transfers, but ultimately closed the case without filing any charges.\nZ Financial acquired the properties through the county’s delinquent tax and scavenger sales — a high-risk, high-reward investment arena.\nTax buyers used to be able to earn double-digit interest rates as residents paid back taxes — they can still earn significant interest after state law was\nrecently reformed\nto lower the maximum rates to cut a break to homeowners who fall behind. But when those taxes aren’t repaid and the deed is turned over to the taxbuyer, investors like Moll can end up with a lot of properties that are worth less — or would cost more to repair — than they paid for them.\nMoll didn’t return requests for comment made by\nThe Real Deal\nvia phone and email.\nTransferring property in this way is not illegal and Moll told the Tribune that he gave the properties to Tabb because the man expressed a desire to rehabilitate and live in them. But a co-defendant in a recent city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Damien Garrett Chiodo, said this instance of it is unethical, if true.\n“I don’t know these guys. For all I know, they’re good guys and got themselves in just a pickle,” Chiodo said. “But I do know it smells bad.”\nChiodo said he became aware of Goldmine when he received notice that he was named in a city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Moll, himself and Novacore, LLC — an Arizona-based company, now inactive, formerly managed by Chiodo and others, according to court records and business registry information.\nThe complaint, which came in December as the city restarted gunning for Moll, centers around two neighboring properties in the South Shore neighborhood that the city claimed owners allowed to become “an illegal parking lot and dumping ground for abandoned vehicles and refuse.”\n\nNow, this is where things get tricky.\nUntil 2014, a single-family home straddled the line between the two properties at 7543 and 7545 South Oglesby, so they were typically bought and sold together, but had two separate property identification numbers with the county.\nIn 2003, the then-owner of the property transferred the ownership to someone new and signed a deed for both properties that was only recorded against the property identification number for 7543 South Oglesby. The other property, 7545 South Oglesby, was later sold at a scavenger sale, creating a whole different chain of ownership for that parcel.\nMoll’s other company, Z Financial Illinois G Properties, bought 7545 South Oglesby in 2011 and then transferred it to Goldmine via quit claim deed in 2017, property records show. Novacore acquired 7543 S. Oglesby through a quit claim deed in 2014, a deed that also included the property description of the neighboring lot.\nThe two properties have been in a state of neglect that the city claims is an environmental hazard to the neighborhood since 2023. So, when notices of code violations weren’t met with compliance, the city filed suit against both companies and the people they could tie to them, including Chiodo.\nChiodo, who is now the president of KeyLink, a company that helps manage distressed real estate assets for clients like banks and hedge funds, said he did not receive notice of the violations sent to the business because it has been dissolved. Arizona business registry information shows that the LLC has been inactive since 2019.\nThe city asked the court to order that the defendants in the case clean up the properties immediately and is seeking $4.35 million in damages, based on complaints that the owners of the properties used it as an illegal parking lot for abandoned vehicles and failed to put up required fencing or take down a falling tree, creating an environmental hazard for residents in the area.\nWhen he received notice of the suit, Chiodo said he paid to clean up the sites as requested and is hoping to clear things up with the city as soon as possible.\n“We had no idea we even owned the thing, and we’re just trying to make it right and get out from under this mess,” Chiodo said.\nMeanwhile, Moll is unlikely to be absolved anytime soon as the city has moved to consolidate three cases brought against Goldmine Investments to be litigated together in Circuit Court.\nQCD Financial\nHinsdale-based investor QCD Financial has been found liable “at least 1,618 times” for municipal code violations across 125 properties it owns, allegedly amassing over $3.8 million in fines and interest since 2013, according to court records.\nQCD has been operating in Chicago for at least the last 11 years, and the city has been slapping the landowner with health and safety violations ever since, court records show. The company currently owns at least 123 properties across the South and West sides of the city, according to a map compiled by the city.\nA Circuit Court judge granted a city motion that was filed in December to consolidate past judgements made against QCD into a single case. In the coming months, the court will weigh in on the central question that remains before the two parties: how will QCD pay its debts to the city?\nAttempts to reach QCD weren’t successful.\nA spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law declined to comment on the specifics of the cases brought against QCD and Goldmine in recent months, but confirmed that the city’s special collections unit had taken “additional enforcement actions” against the two companies.\nThe city’s special collections unit is a group of attorneys housed under the Law Department’s Collections, Ownership, and Administrative Litigation Division that evolved out of lessons the division learned while tracking and enforcing the debt racked up by another Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson, Holtkamp said.\nWilson racked up over $15 million in fines for municipal property violations and may be barred from ever investing in Chicago real estate again as part of any settlement that might be reached in a bankruptcy case filed by her businesses in the fall, Holtkamp said. The two sides will meet to discuss the proposed settlement on April 1. It remains uncertain whether the final agreement will include a ban on investing in Chicago.\nAs the city’s special task force ramps up its work, it will start by focusing on about 10 more landowners that hit a certain threshold of unpaid fines and fees with the city, including QCD and Goldmine.\n",

    "content": "It’s not hard to spot a mullet in the lobby cafe of the WSA building.\nOne man sporting a blonde mini-mullet bounces past another — dark-haired half-mullet — leaning back in his chair, sporting AirPods and a red puffer jacket, facing the rack of artfully arrayed fashion and design magazines.\nThese people, Vanessa Low Mendelson says, pointing around to those milling about the cafe, are evidence of the resurgent and hip FiDi. Mendelson, the sales director at 77 Greenwich Street, has a vested interest in the attractiveness of the neighborhood.\nIn certain respects, the area is thriving.\nLarge office-to-residential conversions have filled up quickly, spurring more development and even more conversions. The area’s population has nearly tripled this decade. There’s a new Whole Foods!\nIt is no longer the dominion of suit-and-tie-wearing financiers that flee the scene once they punch their timecard.\n“This neighborhood is cool,” Mendelson exclaimed at one point during a walk-through of the 89-unit building.\nBut cool — of the mullet-sporting, canvas bag-toting variety — may not be synonymous with six-figure downpayments that brokers like Mendelson need to fill their buildings.\nFiDi has for years counted the most new development inventory of any neighborhood in the city. An analysis of public records by\nThe Real Deal\nfound the area’s unsold buildings account for over 20 percent of Manhattan’s unsold units and over 10 percent of New York City’s unsold units. That excludes buildings that haven’t begun closings, like the long-awaited 272-unit tower overlooking the site of the former World Trade Center.\nThe disparity has only grown in recent years. As of the end of 2024, FiDi had more unsold new condos than the rest of all of Manhattan below 34th Street combined — the first time that has happened since 2012, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\nThe explanations are, as often is the case in New York real estate, myriad. The 654-foot-tall elephant in the room, Harry Macklowe’s One Wall Street, contributes an outsize portion of the unsold units.\nBut conversions like LCOR’s Broad Exchange and shiny developments like Trinity Place Holdings’ 77 Greenwich Street still have a sizable chunk of places to move, and even well-regarded projects like Lightstone Group’s 130 William Street are not completely sold out.\nThen there are the projects that have languished, like Fortis Development’s 161 Maiden Lane, or until recently, the Rafael Viñoly-designed tower at 125 Greenwich Street.\nThe FiDi construction boom came as sales were already spiking in the mid-2010’s, and the resulting projects that launched have been the core of the city’s already anemic condo inventory. But as hundreds of units in the area continue to wither on the vine and the city’s pipeline looks dry for years to come, the pressure is on for these closely watched addresses and the answers they hold for the next wave of new development.\nA neighborhood with promise\nFor most of the 21st Century, the Financial District, with its cornucopia of Art Deco buildings and relatively cheap land, has proven irresistible to developers.\nLarge conversions at 15 Broad Street and 20 Pine Street showed circa 2008 that condos in the area could sell as a value proposition. Following the financial crisis, construction slowed across the city and it was not until the mid 2010s condo boom that sizable projects returned to the area. And once they started, they didn’t stop.\nTowers Time Equities’ luxury tower at 50 West Street and the Beekman Residences by GFI Development Company and GB Lodging brought around 250 units to the market as the first wave of successful larger new developments.\n“There was a bit of a divergence in thinking where some developers saw the neighborhood trending up and tried to push pricing, while others met the market where it was at.”\nCorcoran Sunshine Marketing Group’s Ryan Schleis\nThe two buildings scooped up contracts on over\n50 percent\nof their units by 2015, but by 2017, the 191-unit 50 West landed a\nfresh loan secured by its 46 unsold condos\n, which ended up being used as rentals for the time being (many of those units still have not been sold, according to public records and recent StreetEasy listings).\nThose two buildings were part of the more than 1,300 condos under construction at the start of 2015 — by\n2018\n, that number had ballooned to over 2,100, according to data from the Downtown Alliance. During that time, condos consistently made up a majority of the units under construction, despite the area being nearly two-thirds renters.\nThat group of projects included many of the big swings on the market now: One Wall, 77 Greenwich, 125 Greenwich and 130 William (25 Park Row just sold out its 110-unit project this year). The 64-unit conversion at 1 Park Row was announced shortly after, and launched sales just weeks ago.\nThe area has always held an appeal for developers, who see reasonably priced assemblages and an “eclectic” collection of Class B and C offices, according to Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller.\n“You’re getting big footprints, big envelopes, big buildings that you can get at a fairly decent price per square foot,” Starr Associates’ Shaun Pappas added.\nWrong price, wrong time\nThe screws on many of these projects were still turning when the condo market began to sour.\nAfter three straight years of growth, Manhattan condo sales dropped 20 percent in 2018, before falling off a pandemic-induced cliff in 2020, according to data from Miller Samuel. In the Financial District, 2016 saw 385 closed sales at an average price per square foot of $1,888 — numbers that fell precipitously the following year.\n“When they penciled and wrote those checks, it was pre-pandemic and the world and the city looked a little different back then,” said Compass’ Vickey Barron, who at one point worked on sales at 100 Barclay Street. “Then there’s so much that came to market.”\nWhile developers trying to catch a wave launched buildings around the city through the mid- to late-2010s, the density and scale of the projects in FiDi is relatively unrivaled for that time period.\n\nBut the frenzy to develop Lower Manhattan has led to self-cannibalization — the returns and prices developers thought they could get may not have accounted for the amount of supply building up at the same time in the same place.\n“There’s more development sites, more opportunity — but absorption rates are challenged by the fact that there’s this constant supply of new product entering the market,” Miller said.\nEven then, developers may have overestimated how far they could push prices in an area that has been claiming to be “revitalized” for almost two decades. Barron said one developer previously likened Park Place to the uptown enclave of a similar name.\n“It’s not Park Avenue,” she said.\n“There was a bit of a divergence in thinking,” said Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group’s Ryan Schleis, where some developers saw the neighborhood trending up and tried to push pricing, while others met the moment in the market.\nOne Wall, Harry Macklowe’s hulking obelisk at the epicenter of Wall Street, stands out as a poster child of what has turned out to be wishful thinking. The 566-unit office-to-residential conversion hit the market asking on average over $2,400 per square foot, with many units pushing $3,000.\nIt remains unclear how much leeway Macklowe has on pricing after sinking at least $2.6 billion into the project, but the units that have moved have been more in line with area norms — around $1,900 per square foot, according to Marketproof.\nOf the 130 units sold or in contract, 103 are studios or one-bedrooms, and One Wall has moved nearly half of its studio stock while two-bedrooms are 13 percent sold and three-bedrooms just 5 percent sold. The building hasn’t sold a single unit above the 34th floor, where the price per square foot is generally higher.\nAt 77 Greenwich, no studios are still on offer, and the property has sold or put into contract around 60 percent of its 89 units for an average price per square foot of around $1,800. “Demand in the neighborhood is not as deep for three and four bedrooms as it is in Tribeca or the Upper East Side,” Schleis said.\nProjects considered to be selling at a better clip, like the 242-unit tower at 130 William Street and the 110-unit conversion at 25 Park Row, benefitted from having fewer units to move and launching before 2020, despite both seeking over $2,000 per square foot.\n“Developments in the Financial District have been very aggressive with their pricing, and that’s why they’re not selling,” said Platinum Properties’ Khashy Eyn.\nShlomi Reuveni, who took over sales at 77 Greenwich Street last year, said that even if the price per square foot is reasonable, condo conversions can end up with massive apartments because of their deep floor plans.\n“Even at the same price per square foot, your price point is very high,” he said.\nRenters, for now\nJust around the corner from One Wall, 25 Broad Street has flipped rentals to condos at a humble $1,200 per square foot and sold nearly two-thirds of the 308-unit building.\n“Those boxes are checked for a certain demographic, looking for either studios, one-bedrooms or small two-bedrooms,” said Reuveni, who also took over sales at the LCOR development in 2023.\n“All you have to do is take a walk down Broad Street at 12 or 1 o’clock in the afternoon, and you’re not seeing the same suit-and-tie wearing professionals,” Reuveni said.\nFor those laser-focused on the Lower Manhattan condo market, the half-filled towers dotting the area might spell doom and gloom, but the success of the area’s rental projects shows people do want to live there, even if they don’t yet want to take out a mortgage.\nVanbarton Group’s 160 Water Street, which was just completed this year, has 99 percent of its 588 units leased, according to NY Yimby. Metro Loft’s conversions at 20 Broad Street and 180 Water Street both have occupancy rates above 95 percent across their more than 1,000 units.\nRental units likely appeal more to the 18- to 35-year old cohort, which makes up a third of Lower Manhattan’s total population, according to Downtown Alliance president Jessica Lappin.\nDevelopers have taken note, according to Lappin, and the current pipeline has reversed the 2010s condo craze — 70 percent of the 8,000 planned units in the area are now rentals.\nWhile the turn to rentals might seem foreboding for the developers sitting with empty condos, the population influx should only help over time.\n“The rental market sometimes gets hotter first, because people move down there, they rent for a year or two, and then they buy,” Pappas said. “The slowness is just part of the way that the city develops as these different areas become more of the ‘residential hotspots.’”\nIn the meantime, some buildings are taking part in the time-honored tradition of renting out vacant units. One Wall has a number of apartments listed on StreetEasy, including two recently rented three-bedrooms.\nAt 77 Greenwich, the tide is already starting to turn. All four of the building’s four-bedrooms have sold, according to Reuveni, and the team is now looking to combine units to meet the uptick in demand for larger spaces. (It likely has not hurt that since taking over the project, Reuveni has dropped the price on several units by as much as 30 percent from the original offering plan, according to StreetEasy.)\nEven the closely-watched One Wall has started selling over two units in each of the last six months, according to Marketproof. (That pace still places sellout in 2040).\nBut perhaps the most important factor is that the market is starting to turn. Last year, new development contracts\nbeat the city’s 10-year average\n, and Miller said there’s “probably more optimism” now than in recent years.\nThat is all lenders need to give projects in the area a little more time: Macklowe secured a\n$665 million refinancing\nat One Wall and Trinity Place Holdings\nextended its debt\non 77 Greenwich earlier this year.\nThe latest Downtown litmus test is the long-stalled, now-restarted luxury supertall at\n125 Greenwich Street\n, which just announced the completion of its top-floor amenities suite. At a party celebrating the reveal of the city’s highest gym and pool, Douglas Elliman’s Stacy Spielman said the 272-unit building was on track to begin closings this spring.\nIn the meantime, the development team is looking to\nrefinance its existing $313 million construction loan\n, a bid on the sense of renewed optimism in the FiDi condo market.\n“You don’t want to be caught coming to market in a three-year stretch where it wasn’t the best,” Pappas said of lenders’ willingness to work with developers. “At the end of the day you missed the next cycle of velocity, which I think we’re about to hit.”",

    "content": "Related California and East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation have employed an Oakland overlay zone for affordable housing to win approval for a 192-unit complex in Jack London Square.\nThe Irvine-based builder and locally based nonprofit developer used\nS-13 zoning\nto approve the five-story affordable apartments around a central plaza at 430 Broadway, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe joint venture had\nsought permits last fall\nto build the three-building, block-size project on land owned by Alameda County, south of Interstate 880 between 5th Street, 4th Street, Broadway and Franklin Street. The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it’s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway. A rendering suggests two seven- or eight-story buildings and a 20-story tower overlooking I-880.\nRelated California, founded in 1989, is a unit of New York-based Related Companies. The California subsidiary has developed 20,700 apartments, and owns and manages more than 13,000 affordable and workforce housing units across the Golden State, according to its website.\nEast Bay Asian Local Development, founded in 1975 by a group of Asian Pacific Islander college students and young professionals, owns and manages more than 35 residential and commercial developments, according to its website.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Developer Vivian Dimond took over the stalled condo building in North Bay Village, a 15-story shell on Harbor Island,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe planned\n54-unit building\nat 7918 West Drive will now be called Tula Residences.\nDimond’s\nBayshore Grove Capital is now the sole managing member of the LLC that owns the property, she said. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project, but is no longer involved in construction or the development.\nDimond declined to share financial terms of the deal, but said the agreement was finalized last year.\nConstruction of the building, which will rise to 21 stories once completed, stalled in late 2023,\nTRD\npreviously reported. Liens piled up against the developer, including a nearly $7 million lien filed by Thornton Residential, the former general contractor. A cooling company also filed a lawsuit against Pacific &amp; Orient.\nDimond said construction will resume “very soon” and will likely be completed within 18 months, sometime in 2026.\nThe new team made some changes to the floor plans and amenities, Dimond said.\n\n“We just got approved for some changes we made with the city,” Dimond said, referring to the floor plans. “The number of units didn’t change, but the layouts changed.”\nThe lobby will now be on the first floor; it was previously planned for the sixth floor. Dimond said the amenities, like the gym and pool, were enhanced with an emphasis on wellness. Some of the windows are also larger, offering better views.\nSales will launch this spring with\nEllis Bachman\n, who recently joined Brown Harris Stevens from Douglas Elliman’s Eklund-Gomes team, Pedro Cuberos and Madison Napoles. Bachman said the project was a “major factor” in deciding his move to BHS.\nThe units will range from two- to three-bedroom condos, as well as six five-bedroom penthouses. The two-bedroom units will start at just under $2 million; the three-bedrooms at nearly $3 million and the penthouses at close to $6 million. They’ll each have large outdoor terraces and waterfront views.\nSales will launch soon, Bachman said, calling the project “accessible luxury.”\nThe developer is also negotiating construction financing, Dimond said. Dimond, a broker and developer, has 1,500 residential units in the pipeline through her Coconut Grove-based Bayshore Grove Capital. Bayshore’s projects include\nLe Parc at Lauderhill\n, a 330-unit apartment development in Broward County, and a mixed-use project with about\n900 workforce housing units\nnear Miami’s Allapattah.\nDespite the delay with the previous developer, the\nNorth Bay Village\nproject will still mark the first new condo building to be completed in the city in more than a decade. The town has attracted major investment in recent years, with a number of projects in the pipeline. Last year, Mikael Hamaoui’s Riviera Horizons\nlaunched sales\nof a Pagani-branded condo project in North Bay Village; other developments include a phased megaproject by the billionaire Ansin family’s Sunbeam Properties, and the\nEichner family’s\nplanned Continuum Club &amp; Residences.\n“I like the fact that it is way ahead of everyone else,” Dimond said.\nP&amp;O’s Chan had been working on plans for the project for almost a decade. The developer paid $8.3 million for the 0.8-acre site in 2015. Construction was set to begin in 2018, but the firm broke ground years later, in 2023.\nSales launched\nthat same year. One of two presales from before Dimond’s involvement will remain, she said.\n",

The senior loan backing the office building was\ntransferred to special servicing\nover the summer as an October maturity date neared.\nBoth the $335 million commercial mortgage-backed security senior loan and the $170 million mezzanine loan held by Nuveen were extended. The senior loan was also securitized in a single-asset, single-borrower deal.\nTamares infused $20 million worth of equity in the building as part of the extension. The firm also paid another $20 million for leasing efforts and capital expenditures to stabilize the office property.\n“This is a new era, and we are feeling very positive about it,” Tamares chair Poju Zabludowicz told the Observer.\nAn Iron Hound Management team including Chris Herron and Anthony D’Amelio led the extension talks. SL Green Realty advised Nuveen. Rialto Capital is the special servicer of the CMBS debt.\n\nWhen the loan was transferred to special servicing over the summer, the 520,000-square-foot building was 75 percent occupied. Tamares is on the verge of losing a couple of major tenants in the coming summer: ABC’s “Good Morning America” is leaving its 66,000-square-foot studio space to go to Disney’s Hudson Square campus, while Nasdaq is leaving 53,000 square feet to consolidate offices elsewhere.\nA Tamares Group executive said the landlord was in “preliminary discussions” with possible tenants for the ABC space, saying it could accommodate retail or experiential tenants, in addition to remaining a studio space.\nOther tenants at the property include law firm Ice Miller and Shanghai Construction Group America.\nElsewhere in the neighborhood, the American Strategic Investment Company agreed to sell 9 Times Square\nfor $63.5 million\n, $100 million less than it paid for the office property a decade earlier.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Another CrowdStreet executive has left the company.\nBrendan Sparrough, CrowdStreet’s former head of capital markets, has departed the embattled crowdfunding platform for a new position with a real estate private equity firm, according to a post on LinkedIn.\nSparrough is now the second high-level executive to leave CrowdStreet, a platform that allows everyday investors to invest in real estate, in recent weeks.\nCrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\nIan Formigle\nrecently announced on LinkedIn that he accepted a new role.\nFive employees working as investment managers or analysts left CrowdStreet in February, according to a review of FINRA’s BrokerCheck.\n“Personnel change is inevitable when you are expanding your value proposition and it is no secret CrowdStreet is actively structuring our business model to expand to other asset classes, including with several new executive hires over the past several months. CrowdStreet is evolving,” said a spokesperson for CrowdStreet.\nSparrough played a key role in CrowdStreet’s relationships with institutional clients, leading the company’s capital markets team that sourced and selected deals for the platform.\nSparrough oversaw the origination and closing of over $1.7 billion in equity across more than 100 real estate investments, according to his LinkedIn. He accepted a new position with O’Connor Capital Partners as the head of capital formation.\n\nThe platform has come under pressure from investors because of the Elie Schwartz fiasco. Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz recently pleaded\nguilty\nto one count of wire fraud where Schwartz acknowledged misappropriating $54 million of CrowdStreet investor funds designated for an acquisition of an office complex in Atlanta and a commercial property in Miami Beach. Schwartz faces up to 20 years in prison.\nInvestors have turned their eye on CrowdStreet in light of Schwartz’s guilty plea. A group of about\n125 investors\nin a Nightingale office project in Chicago filed a claim in arbitration demanding CrowdStreet cover $7.2 million in losses, alleging the firm failed to see clear issues with Nightingale and Schwartz, according to Bisnow.\nCrowdStreet has claimed to be a victim of Schwartz’s fraud and alerted authorities about the wrongdoing.\nIn the summer of 2023, an independent manager for investors in Nightingale’s projects announced in a webinar that most of their money had been misappropriated. Schwartz allegedly used that money for personal expenses and other Nightingale projects. He used $12 million of investor funds to bet on First Republic\nbank’s stock\nand options prior to the bank’s seizure by regulators.\nCrowdStreet came under scrutiny because it failed to require Schwartz to hold the money in a designated escrow account.\nCrowdStreet’s long-time CEO\nTore Steen\nleft the firm weeks after the news of the Nightingale scandal broke. Last year, the firm hired John Imbriglia as the CEO who replaced an interim chief executive.\nSparrough did not return a request to comment.\nCorrection\n:\nA previous version of the story\nmisidentified the name of CrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\n.\n",

    "content": "The debate over 485x may have died down (for now), but the fight to expand prevailing wages for construction workers is far from over.\nNearly five years ago, lawmakers\napproved\na measure that required union-level wages on private projects where public funds cover at least 30 percent of construction costs and such costs exceed $5 million. The requirements did not kick in until 2022, and the law imbued a 13-member board with the authority to raise these thresholds and to determine which programs count as public funding.\nThe Democratic majorities of the state Senate and Assembly\nwant\nto get rid of that board and increase the number of projects that must pay construction workers prevailing wages. In their budget resolutions, both chambers called for reducing the threshold to 20 percent and eliminating the Public Subsidy Board. The Assembly has also floated new dollar thresholds.\nGary LaBarbera, who heads both the city and state chapters of the Building and Construction Trades Council, is on the board but agrees that it needs to go.\nThe board was tasked with hashing out what construction projects qualify and, more fundamentally, what constitutes “construction” under the law. That, by and large, didn’t happen, according to LaBarbera.\nLaBarbera told\nThe Real Deal\nthat construction and business interests are pretty evenly split on the board, and as a result, they can’t reach a consensus. Of the 36 projects that have come before the board, the group found that prevailing wages were only required on six projects.\n“We get together four times a year to review projects,” he said. “These are two- to three-hour meetings, and all it is is a debate.”\nHe believes the legislature needs to both clarify and broaden the requirements, and that the Department of Labor should take over for the board.\nDevelopers have repeatedly opposed efforts to expand prevailing wage requirements, arguing that it drives up construction costs to the point of making projects prohibitively expensive.\nThe law spares housing projects where at least 25 percent of the units are affordable, excluding most 485x projects.\nIf prevailing wage requirements will be expanded, they’d add onto an already complex set of challenges facing developers, including stubbornly high interest rates and the prospect of tariffs driving up material costs.\nLast month, New York’s Associated Builders and Contractors\ncalled\non state lawmakers to adjust how it calculates prevailing wages, arguing that they are wrongfully inflated. The group also opposed the passage of the 2020 law, and on Wednesday an ABC representative warned that expanding these mandates would be “devastating” to the industry.\nLaBarbera says securing changes to these wage requirements is his organization’s top priority this legislative session. The group has been working to build public support for these changes,\n\nLast year, a BCTC-commissioned poll found that 77 percent of the 834 voters in New York surveyed believe developers should pay prevailing wages to construction workers on projects that receive $1 million or more in public subsidies. At the city level individual unions are also\npushing\nto require prevailing wages on more city-funded projects.\nWhat we’re thinking about\n: Global tariffs on steel and aluminum went into effect on Wednesday. How will these and other tariffs affect construction in New York? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: The New York Housing Conference, along with more than 100 lawmakers, housing groups, developers and others, sent a letter to members of the New York Congressional Delegation, urging them to reject cuts to staffing and programs at the Department of Housing Urban Development. The letter also urges the officials to support\nlegislation\nthat would lift a cap on how many private activity bonds the state can issue to finance affordable housing and that would\nincrease\nallocations of the 9 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credits.\nElsewhere in New York…\n— Mayor Eric Adams faces an uphill battle to re-election, but he says he’s almost ready to start campaigning. Adams told reporters on Tuesday that he expects to begin campaigning “very soon,”\nPolitico New York reports\n. “I’m a solid, solid campaigner. I know how to articulate a message that’s clear and crisp, and that’s what I’m going to do,” Adams said. “I’m going to enjoy every moment of selling my product to the people of this city.”\n— More than two dozen elected officials in New York, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are calling on the Department of Homeland Security to release Mahmoud Khalil,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. “The administration’s pattern of targeting the rights of students and immigrants to speak against injustice undermines democracy and makes everyone less safe,” the letter states. DHS agents told Khalil his green card would be revoked and his student visa canceled. A judge temporarily blocked his deportation on Monday,\n— New York is testing raw milk for bird flu,\nthe Times-Union reports\n. In January, the state issued a notice requiring monthly testing for raw milk, in addition to testing of raw milk intended for pasteurization. Bird flu has not yet been detected in cattle in New York.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$15.3 million\nfor a 3,073-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 217 West 57th Street in Times Square North. Kane Manera and Janet Wang of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$14.35 million\nfor a development site at 103 East 29th Street in Kips Bay. Impact Equities purchased the property from Auevilla Holdings.\n— Matthew Elo",

    "content": "As the Trump Administration’s tariffs rattle the S&amp;P 500 and stoke fears of recession, New York City renters are buttoning down the hatches in response to mounting uncertainty about where the economy is headed.\nThose fears are fueling record rents.\nFor the first time since\n2023\n, Manhattan’s median rent hit a fresh high of $4,500 in February, according to a report by Douglas Elliman appraiser Jonathan Miller.\nThe city’s vacancy rate slipped for the fourth-straight month to a pinched 2.4 percent and the number of bidding wars broke a record — one in four units invited such competition.\nDemand in the outer boroughs reached a similar fever pitch. The average rental price in Brooklyn topped an all-time high for the second month straight at $4,035. In Northwest Queens, rents topped $3,400, stamping the fourth increase in five months.\nThe market has tightened as tenants considering homeownership delay their decision amid an uncertain economic outlook. Mortgage rates may have slipped since President Donald Trump took office, but the administration’s erratic policy decisions have obscured projections of where the market is headed.\n\n“The economic chaos of the past couple of months negates the perception of slightly lower rates,” Miller said.\nTrump, in his first 50 days, has imposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, promised higher levies, then reversed course on some of those threats.\nThe whiplash sent markets reeling; the S&amp;P 500 as of Wednesday had lost $4 trillion from its peak last month — an 8 percent decline, Reuters\nreported\n. The Nasdaq slipped 10 percent from its December peak last week, entering correction territory.\nThe Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts to the federal workforce have fueled a sense of instability, which may hold Americans back from making any big life decisions for the near future.\nThat means February’s record could be the first of many in 2025.\n“[The record] suggests that rents may set new highs this year, especially when we reach the seasonal high in the summer,” Miller said.\n",

    "content": "Los Angeles County voters favor building dense apartments in urban areas in exchange for allowing fewer homes in fire-prone areas.\nTo compensate for restricting homebuilding in fire-prone communities, county voters backed greater production of high-density housing in urban areas, with 55 percent in support compared to 30 percent opposed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n, citing a new poll.\nThe poll, conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the newspaper, found that voters favored boosting funding for fire protection, even if it increased their taxes.\nAn overwhelming majority of county voters also supported strengthening building codes and imposing greater restrictions on home construction in high-risk areas after the January firestorm burned more than\n12,000 homes\nbetween Altadena and the Pacific Palisades.\nSome 80 percent of those polled backed tougher building codes to make homes more fire resistant, even if it added costs.\nSeven out of 10 wanted more regulations to curb homebuilding in wildfire-prone neighborhoods.\n“This is a huge event in L.A. history,” Mark DiCamillo, poll director at UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, told the Times. “It’s having a major effect on what people think needs to be done in terms of making housing safer.”\nState and local officials have not decided if there will be any building code changes for homes rebuilt from the fires. Codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones now\nrequire significant measures\n, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires.\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes.\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in L.A. County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas, according to the Times.\nA poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute\nfound 81 percent of city voters\nbacked speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jamestown’s latest investment move in Atlanta gives it a minority stake in a key mixed-use development.\nThe firm acquired a stake in Inman Quarter, which anchors Inman Park, from TriBridge Residential, the Atlanta Business Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe 208,000-square-foot development includes 200 apartments and 40,000 square feet of retail, with restaurants like BeetleCat, MF Sushi and Bread &amp; Butterfly.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction establishes a joint venture with TriBridge, which purchased Inman Quarter for $72.5 million in 2015 alongside Coro Realty Advisors. Coro later sold its stake, leaving TriBridge as the sole owner. At that time, the apartments were 90 percent leased, and the retail was about 85 percent occupied.\nA block from the Atlanta Beltline’s Eastside Trail, Inman quarter has become a popular destination, drawing about 500,000 visitors annually, according to Jamestown, citing property software company Placer.ai.\nJamestown, the firm behind major projects like Ponce City Market and Colony Square, plans to lease out vacant retail spaces and to program events to activate its courtyard.\nAtlanta’s retail market is booming, with a\nrecord-low vacancy\nrate of 3.4 percent, according to Colliers.\n\nDeveloped by JPX Works and South City Partners, Inman Quarter opened over a decade ago, coinciding with the early growth of the Beltline’s Eastside Trail and rising demand for walkable, urban living.\nThe investment reflects a broader strategy in Atlanta, where investors are targeting intown districts for redevelopment.\nRecent deals include Canvas Company’s $6.6 million acquisition of a 17-space portfolio in East Atlanta Village last month and Third &amp; Urban’s $13.75 million acquisition of more than 35,000 square feet at the Virginia-Highlands retail district in December. That deal pencils out to $393 per square foot.\nMeanwhile, New City Properties is\nadvancing its redevelopment\nof the Neuhoff meat-packing plant site, backed by $550 million from JPMorgan and Cousins Properties, adding apartments, office and retail space as part of a significant mixed-use project.\nJamestown has been expanding its footprint in Atlanta.

    "content": "The push to get public employees back to offices in Chicago is being led by the private sector — and landlords anxious to resuscitate the streets of the Loop aren’t getting much help from City Hall.\nThe Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago is lobbying Mayor Brandon Johnson to take a clearer stance on the subject and the Chicago Loop Alliance is leading by example, having called its staff back to the office five days a week at the start of the year.\nBut there isn’t much political pressure being levied at City Hall, as downtown aldermen are staying quiet for now. Aldermen who represent the Loop — the 42nd Ward’s Brendan Reilly and Lamont Robinson of the 4th Ward — didn’t respond to requests for comment. Alderman Bill Conway, who also represents part of the Loop, declined to comment.\nThat leaves the industry on its own, with Farzin Parang, head of BOMA in Chicago, trying to rally allies by tying the cause to other concerns of the mayor’s constituents. Elsewhere, mayors are taking the lead on the issue. Most recently, San Francisco\nMayor Daniel Lurie\nordered city desk workers to return to the office at least four days per week by April 28.\n“We urge the mayor to promote a downtown return across all sectors and support policies that boost office occupancy, including reducing the reliance on property tax and improving public transit,” Parang said.\nThe impact of any additional in-office days for government workers could be significant. The City of Chicago alone employs about 10,000 people at offices, with many located in the Loop. Cook County has another 9,000 or so desk employees in the city, and the State of Illinois accounts for thousands more.\nExpecting office occupancy to reach pre-pandemic levels in any city is a stretch, but an influx of thousands of more workers on any given day could have a ripple effect on struggling retailers and support multifamily development, industry insiders say.\nA concerted effort by public sector leadership would supplement the private sector’s push, which has notched some gains for the area but leaves plenty of room for improvement, said John Vance of Chicago retail brokerage Stone Street Real Estate.\n“It would be unfair and wrong to blame the struggles of the Loop on just city of Chicago employees or state of Illinois employees who work in Chicago,” he said. “But they are working for an employer who has a vested interest in making sure that the city of Chicago, and therefore the state of Illinois, does well.”\nWhere RTO policies stand now\nOffice policies across all levels of government in Chicago vary and can be subject to any of the dozens of union contracts dictating certain terms for employers. Representatives of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois did not respond to repeated requests for comment about work-from-home policies.\nA representative of Cook County said all county employees must work in office at least three days per week. Employees can, however, request exceptions to the schedule from the human resources chief. The county didn’t return a request for the number of exemptions granted.\nAs of January, government office use in Chicago is at 73 percent of pre-pandemic levels according to an Avison Young analysis.\nWith over 48,000 employees, the federal government is the largest employer in the city of Chicago. But tracking various agencies’ office policies is complicated by the current presidential administration’s expansive effort to lay off workers and cut office space by as much as 50 percent.\n\n“These reductions, including the recent planned disposal of the SEC lease at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, could mean a busier government footprint in Chicago, but also a smaller one,” Avison analyst Sean Boyd said.\nThe LaSalle-Wacker corridor, a retail submarket that includes many government buildings and law firms, is one of the lowest performing in the Loop with a 36 percent retail vacancy rate in 2024, Stone Street Real Estate found.\n“[Retailers] need the streets to have a vibrancy and energy and people feeling good because there is a healthy buzz that people create when they are physically here,” Stone Street Real Estate’s Vance said.\nOther areas of the Loop bordering the West Loop and River North have had a faster recovery.\n“Chicago is recovering very unevenly, and if a segment of office that is concentrated recovers dramatically, it’s going to have a huge immediate impact on that submarket,” said Greg Kirsch, founder of retail brokerage Kirsch Agency.\nSeeking other solutions\nMultifamily development also plays a key role in the Loop’s recovery.\nIncreasing its full-time residents will improve retail traffic on evenings and weekends, create easier commutes for some workers and diversify the tax base, said Rob Karr, CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association.\nKarr’s organization isn’t fully on board with requiring in-office schedules; Stone Street Real Estate recently studied three boutique retail corridors through North Side neighborhoods that are flourishing, with little to no vacancy on stretches of Damen, Southport and Armitage avenues.\n“While it’s important we find ways to bring shoppers and workers back downtown throughout the week, we don’t support in-office mandates as no one approach fits the needs of all employers and employees,” Karr said. “It will take collaboration between the business community and policymakers to find creative ways to make downtown a destination once again.”\nA transformation is already underway. Between 2000 and 2022, the Loop’s population grew by 154 percent, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Meanwhile, the total population of Chicago declined by 6 percent during the same time period.\nIf the city’s plan to subsidize\noffice-to-multifamily conversions on LaSalle Street\nsucceeds, it will add to the Loop’s residential growth trajectory; developer\nMike Reschke\non Wednesday won Chicago City Council approval for the conversion of five floors of vacant former office space at 208 South LaSalle into 168 apartments with up to $26 million in tax increment financing support from the city, one of several such projects moving forward in the area.\n“The ultimate survival of the Loop as an office destination is going to happen because people live there,” Kirsch said. “There are other markets in the country that have less residential use and they’re going to have a harder time recovering.”\n",

    "content": "A law firm lease will bring Hines’ Texas Tower to 99 percent leased.\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors at 845 Texas Avenue, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren’t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills’ Mark O’Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines’\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building’s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city’s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines’ global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn’t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower’s leasing success highlights the “flight-to-quality” trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston’s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

As a whole, the project’s overall square footage remains the same, as BH3 added more units but decreased the average unit size. The commercial space also was scaled down to 12,200 square feet from 72,200 square feet.\nThe Development Review Committee evaluated the new proposal at its meeting on Tuesday. Next, BH3 will incorporate feedback from the committee and the city’s planning department into its site plan, which will be filed to the city, according to a source familiar with the process. City commissioners will have a final say on the changes at a yet unscheduled meeting.\nBH3 hasn’t yet decided if the units will be condos or apartments, according to the source.\n\nThe DNA project has been in the works since at least 2022. Records show BH3 owns the development site, having paid $23.1 million for it in 2019.\nBH3\n–– led by co-founders Daniel Lebensohn and Gregory Freedman and executive chairman Eric Edidin –– is a real estate development firm. Its projects include the two-tower, 16-story, 160-unit\nPrivé at Island Estates\non an 8-acre island in Aventura.\nDevelopers have seized on downtown Fort Lauderdale, including the\nFlagler Village\narea.\nIn December, BAM Property Development scored approval for a pair of 14-story buildings with\n257 apartments\n, combined, at 650 North Andrews Avenue.\nElsewhere in downtown Fort Lauderdale, developers Steve Hudson and Charlie Ladd plan the 12-story\nWhitfield\nboutique project with 81 hotel keys and 17 penthouse condos at 1007 East Las Olas Boulevard.

The commercial space spans 3,615 square feet.\nGoldstein, an Auschwitz concentration camp survivor according to published reports, bought the storefront in 2015 for $10 million, partially financing the purchase with a $6.3 million mortgage from New York Community Bank, records show. Last year, the financial institution rebranded as Flagstar Bank.\nGoldstein and Flagstar Bank’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGoldstein’s entity bought the commercial units from Aldo Shoes, which leased back the property until 2020, when the shoe retailer moved out. The space has been vacant since the landlord placed the units on the market in December with an undisclosed asking price. The storefront is being marketed by Miami Beach-based\nInHouse Commercial Sales\n.\nGoldstein’s entity allegedly defaulted on the loan by allegedly missing payments since January, as well as failing to pay property insurance and property taxes, the complaint alleges. The borrower also allegedly failed to notify the bank about the death of co-guarantor Leon Goldstein, Zipporah Goldstein’s husband.\nThe $5.5 million mortgage debt includes interest and fees, the lawsuit states.\nCompleted in 1952, the building also includes seven residential condo units that are not targeted in the foreclosure and are owned by entities unrelated to Goldstein, records show.\nInHouse Commercial is marketing the retail space as a possible package deal for six storefronts in\nArt Deco\nbuildings on a six-block stretch of Collins Avenue from Sixth Street to 12th Street. The asking price for the assemblage is more than\n$50 million\n.",

    "content": "In a scheme spanning several years, a Florida resident allegedly orchestrated a fraudulent takeover of a low-income housing cooperative in Brooklyn, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars while leaving the building in financial distress.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James\nfiled a lawsuit\nyesterday against Jessica Vargas for falsely claiming control over the Housing Development Fund Corporation at 13 Scholes Street in Williamsburg. The building was established in 1996 as affordable housing for low-income New Yorkers.\nAccording to investigators, the scheme began after all original resident shareholders of the cooperative had passed away. Vargas, the daughter of a former shareholder, allegedly exploited the situation, despite having no legal claim to the property.\nAlthough Vargas was once the administrator of her late father’s estate, it never contained any assets related to the building and was closed in 2021. Despite this, Vargas began representing herself as the cooperative’s president, secretary, treasurer and sole shareholder.\nTo solidify her fraudulent control, Vargas allegedly created false stock certificates and filed misleading ownership information with city agencies. She then established an invalid lease agreement with a private company, through which she collected at least $442,000 in rent payments that should have gone to the cooperative.\n\nWhile diverting these funds for personal use, Vargas neglected the building’s financial obligations, according to the complaint, failing to pay over $40,000 in property taxes and more than $3,000 in water bills. This left the once-stable affordable housing cooperative in significant debt.\nVargas then attempted to sell the entire building to generate additional personal profit, despite having no legal right to do so, according to the complaint.\nAttorney General James is seeking to remove Vargas from her fraudulently claimed position, ban her from conducting any business related to the property and recover the misappropriated funds.\n“Jessica Vargas declared herself president of a building she had no claim to, exploiting New Yorkers for her personal gain while living over a thousand miles away,” James said in a statement. “What was meant to be affordable housing for New Yorkers has now been manipulated into a Floridian’s personal piggy bank. That is unacceptable.”\n",

It has since earned sporadic media attention, including a shout-out from Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.”\nBuilt in 2003, the home’s unusual shape was a necessity born from its 0.09-acre lot. It initially drew some complaints from neighbors but later became a local curiosity. The house has an unconventional design despite appearing fairly traditional from the front, with its seven windows and a door. A view from the side reveals a wall only 3 feet wide, from which the remaining walls extend outward at an acute angle, like a slice of pie.\nIt was developed by Greg Weissman, then-owner of Advantage Properties, now a broker for @properties Christie’s International Real Estate in Northbrook. It has finally hit above the $325,000 price point\nWeissman hoped to sell it for in 2003\n.\nIt hit the market in September, finding a buyer just two days later.\n\nThe buyer was Tanaka Littlepaige, a manager at the world’s largest derivatives exchange, Chicago-based CME Group, according to county records.\nThe seller was Abigail Drazner, an operations project manager at insurance and financial services firm Alera Group, who bought the home in 2020. For a few months in 2020 it was listed as a short-term rental, offering free pizza for the first booker.\nTed Pickus and Lisa Schulkin had the listing, and Beth Wexler represented Littlepaige, all agents with @properties Christie’s.\nThe two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom house includes 9-foot ceilings, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and a paver brick walkway. It also features a storage shed and a parking pad that accommodates up to four cars, though it lacks a garage. The home has one bedroom upstairs and another in the basement.\nThe property has changed hands multiple times over the years, with the latest sale price comfortably topping its 2021 price of $295,000. Previous sale prices included $300,000 in 2004, $284,500 in 2007, and $260,000 in 2020. Its property taxes for 2023 were $8,014.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Forestar is planning 90 homes between Houston and Galveston after its latest land buy.\nThe subsidiary of Arlington-based homebuilder D.R. Horton picked up a 30-acre parcel along Davis Road in League City, according to a news release from Colliers.\nThe seller was Houston-based Broad Reach Capital, deed records show. Colliers’ Chris Hutcheson, Harrison Kane and James Kadlick represented Broad Reach Capital.\nThe purchase came on the heels of a\ntender offer\nfrom Forestar. The company offered shareholders cash to purchase outstanding 3.85 percent senior notes due. Forestar received offers for 83 percent of the notes, amounting to $329.4 million.\nOther big names in development have also been turning dirt for single-family development in League City.\nHillwood Communities started construction on Legacy by Hillwood, between Interstate 45 and FM 528, a year ago. It was the Dallas-based developer’s third community in the Houston area.\n\nAt full build-out, the 805-acre community will feature 1,600 homes, an elementary school and amenities like pools, a recreation center and launch areas for kayaks and paddleboards.\nLike other far-flung suburbs of major Texas cities, League City is experiencing a wave of growth. In 15 years, its population has nearly tripled to 122,000 people; 40 percent of the city is still undeveloped.\nThe city is preparing for an influx of development with drainage improvements to address flooding and by upgrading the League City waterline, which comes from Houston.\nForestar sold more than 15,000 residential lots last year. The company operates in 24 states, according to its website, but its focus is on communities in the Sunbelt. D. R. Horton acquired a majority stake in Forestar in 2017.\n",

Brokers Michael Haenel, Andy Markham and Phil Haenel of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented EQT Exeter.\nThe renter will use the two-year-old building for warehousing and distribution across the western U.S.\nIn August, Kenco and a division of British Petroleum won\npermission to store petroleum products\nat a 168,000-square-foot facility in Surprise, about 22 miles northwest of Phoenix.\nIn April, EQT Exeter bought the Buckeye warehouse now known as I-10 Gateway for $60.1 million, or $94 per square foot.\nThe Southwest Valley’s industrial submarket “is really, really favorable and attracting a lot of high-quality, national tenants,” Scott Guo, investment and leasing officer for EQT Exeter, told the Business Journal.\n\nHe said large firms such as Kenco are looking to either relocate from California’s Inland Empire, the heart of the Western U.S. industrial distribution market, or are looking to expand their footprints.\nProximity to California ports was “really important for these guys,” Guo said, while the Buckey warehouse’s direct access to Interstate 10 was a “very, very big competitive advantage when they were weighing other buildings that they could have otherwise leased.”\nAcross all submarkets, the Southwest Valley outside Phoenix had the\nmost industrial square footage\ncompleted or under construction in the fourth quarter, according to CBRE.\nSome 87 percent of the 3.2 million square feet of industrial warehouses completed last quarter was in the southwest region. At the same time, 9.7 million square feet were under construction, or 61 percent of the 15.9 million square feet being built across greater Phoenix.\nEQT Exeter, founded in 2006 as Exeter Property Group, has more than $30 billion in assets under management, including more than 2,000 properties and 375 million square feet of warehouses, office and life sciences buildings and homes, according to its website.\nIn early 2021, Swedish private equity manager EQT AB acquired Exeter Property Group and renamed it EQT Exeter, which serves as its real estate arm.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The Trump administration’s anti-DEI crusade is hitting affordable housing groups across the country.\nAfter a review by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, millions of dollars of federal contracts in the sector were canceled, Bloomberg\nreported\n. DOGE staff determined which contracts to cut by searching nonprofit websites and LinkedIn pages for terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThe contracts were cut in February after DOGE directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to inform nonprofits if they were “not in compliance with the Executive Order titled ‘Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.’”\nProjects in more than 1,000 communities were affected by the canceled contracts. The projects involved addressing homelessness, disaster recovery, persistent poverty and more housing issues.\nAt least eight national organizations saw technical assistance contracts canceled, taking away grants for consulting on tools, coordination and systems. Two of the three groups that administer Section 4 — which provides support for capacity-building and community development and requires recipients to “advance housing justice” and “support underserved communities,” according to HUD — had awards eliminated too.\nThe nonprofit\nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation\nhad all of its technical assistance and Section 4 awards canceled, according to the organization. The $30 million in lost contracts included providing first-time homebuyer support in the Mississippi Delta to local teachers.\n\nEnterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit\nrun by former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan\n, had four contracts canceled, including a $32 million reward under Section 4, for which the nonprofit would redistribute funds to groups that build and preserve affordable housing.\nDonovan said the cuts “will raise costs for families, hobble the creation of affordable homes, forfeit local jobs, and sap opportunity from thousands of communities in all 50 states.”\nThe third group that administers Section 4, Habitat for Humanity, did not appear to be affected by the cuts; its website describes the group as a nonprofit ecumenical Christian organization.\nWhile HUD acquiesced to the cuts, the agency said it was planning to allow appeals and is now communicating that process with grantees.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Spanning 8,700 square feet on less than a quarter acre, it sold then for about $931 per square foot, and now for about $667 per square foot.\nThe sellers listed it\n14 months after they bought it for $8.2 million\n, but price cuts over time brought the asking price down to $6.39 million.\nThe property went under contract in February and closed last week. The sellers’ names are hidden behind a land trust.\nThe buyers, not yet revealed in public records, were represented by Compass agents Eudice Fogel and Jayme Slate. Emily Sachs Wong of @properties Christie’s International Real Estate had the listing.\nThe sale price still ranks as the seventh-highest for a Chicago-area home so far this year.\n\nIt includes a four-car garage, elevator, rooftop deck with a metal pergola and a walled courtyard.\nA highlight is the staircase, designed as a modern homage to the iconic metal staircase legendary Chicago architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe created for the Arts Club. Lohan, the home’s architect, is Mies’ grandson.\nLohan designed the house for lumber scion Harry Seigle, who sold his family’s lumber and home supply business in 2005 for $121 million. The architect is known for designing prominent structures like the former\nMcDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook\nand the Shedd Aquarium’s Abbott Oceanarium.\nOthers among Chicago’s top home sales so far this year include a Gold Coast penthouse at Elm &amp; State that sold for over $10 million. It was previously owned by former Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari. In Winnetka, two $12 million homes\nsold last week\nin addition to a\n$35 million mansion at 419 Sheridan Road\n, sold by former Goldman Sachs partner Muneer Satter in February.\nLuxury homes in Chicago often sell for less than their last transaction.

    "content": "Russell Galbut’s GFO Investments plans a 410-unit Live Local Act apartment project in Miami-Dade County, as developers seize on the state affordable housing law.\nMiami-based GFO, the Galbut family’s office, proposes a 19-story building and a 16-story building with a seven-story, 950-space garage podium, and a seven-story medical office building on a 4.1-acre site at 7350 Coral Way in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application filed to Miami-Dade last week. The neighborhood is known as Coral Terrace.\nDr. Jorge Perez, whose specialties include neonatology and neonatal medicine, and his team are partnering on the project and will lease the medical office building, Galbut said. Perez lists affiliations with Baptist Health South Florida and Kidz Medical Services.\n“Housing is desperately needed in the area,” Galbut said.\nAn entity tied to Perez owns the site, records show. GFO also has an ownership stake in the property, which is a former Miami-Dade police shooting range, Galbut said.\nThe project, called Park Residences, will include 90,000 square feet of medical office and retail space. The apartment towers will consist of studios, as well as one- to three-bedroom units, the application shows.\n\nThe 19-story building will have 164 apartments at workforce rents, representing 40 percent of all 410 units, as is required under the\nLive Local Act\n, the application shows. They will be reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade’s annual AMI is $79,400, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation. To qualify for one of the workforce apartments, a one-person household can earn up to $95,400, a two-person household can earn up to $108,960 and a three-person household can earn up to $122,520.\nGFO, through an affiliate, filed a request to Miami-Dade for a pre-application meeting. Pre-application meetings generally are requested to gauge county staff’s input on a proposal before an official application is submitted.\nIf approved, Park Residences is expected to be completed in two to three years, according to Galbut.\nMiami-based\nGFO’s\nprojects include the 51-story short-term rental-friendly condo tower,\nGale Miami Hotel &amp; Residences\n, which was completed last year at 601 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami. Last summer, GFO launched sales for the 32-story, 283-unit short-term rental condo tower\n14 Roc\nat 125 Northeast 14th Street in Miami’s Arts &amp; Entertainment District.\nGalbut also co-leads Miami-based Crescent Heights. Last year, the firm scored Miami Beach project review board approval for a\nfour-story retail\nbuilding at 1901 Alton Road.\n",

    "content": "The owners of scores of torched homes from Altadena to the Pacific Palisades are cashing out.\nA forecast landslide of listings related to the January firestorms that burned more than\n12,000 homes\nin Los Angeles County has picked up speed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nIn late January, the first vacant lot was put up for sale in Altadena. Then more than a dozen lots were listed last month in the Pacific Palisades for\nbetween $2 million and $8 million\n, with the first lot closing at $1.2 million.\nNow the floodgates appear to have opened, according to the Times. Owners of blackened lots are increasingly choosing to sell rather than slog through the time-consuming and costly task of rebuilding.\n“There [are] so many to choose from,” Jeremy Hardy, a broker with Craig Estates &amp; Fine Properties, told the Times.\nAs of early Monday, there were 49 burned lots listed in Pacific Palisades, and 32 up for sale in Altadena, according to Zillow.\nThe reasons for choosing to sell are varied, real estate agents say. Some owners don’t think they have the money to rebuild, while others are aging and don’t want their last years tied up with construction.\n\nSome with rental properties concluded that keeping them wasn’t worth the hassle.\nMost of those interested in acquiring the burned lots are developers, agents say. Builders generally have the cash to buy vacant land. They can also put up with time, aggravation and costs associated with construction.\n“Building a house is one of the most complex and highly regulated activities you possibly can engage in,” Brock Harris, a Keller Williams agent with the first scorched lot listing in Altadena, which sold to a builder, told the Times.\nA rush by developers could help neighborhoods build back quicker.\nThey’re also raising concerns about gentrification and whether longtime owners are getting a fair price for their lots. In\nmiddle-class Altadena\n, residents proclaimed, “Altadena is not for sale.”\nAt least eight burned lots have been sold in the area with most selling for between $500,000 and $600,000, according to Zillow. Agents said the lots are going for two-thirds of what the typical land fetched before the fire.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which walked away rather than pay the tab for the beleaguered Westfield San Francisco Centre mall, wants to sell the office buildings next door for housing.\nThe French conglomerate is about to list the 77,000-square-foot building at 814 Mission Street and the 28,000-square-foot building at 818 Mission Street near Union Square for an undisclosed price,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNearly 20 years ago, Westfield bought the side-by-side buildings between Jessie and Fourth streets for a combined $42 million, or $400 per square foot.\nThe vacant buildings are set to hit the market this month, and could sell for less than half their last traded price. Recent office sales in the area have reset the market at between\n$100 to $200 per square foot\n.\n“Pricing will be in line with other office buildings that have recently sold in Mid-Market,” broker Darren Kuiper of Colliers, working to sell the buildings for Westfield, told the Chronicle. The  listing is shared by brokers Tony Crossley and Robert Gilley of Colliers, and Bruce Carlson of Kennedy Wilson.\nKuiper said Westfield hired Chicago-based SOM to evaluate the combined sites for redevelopment into housing, saying that under current density bonus laws, a 365-foot tower with 400 units was possible.\nBrokers said the Mission Street buildings can be sold separately or together and could be paired with the former Westfield mall next door,\nnow operated by a receiver\n. Its foreclosure auction was\ncanceled last month\nand is now slated for March 27.\nIt was in June 2023 that Paris-based Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and New York-based Brookfield Properties abandoned the city’s largest mall rather than pay its $558 million mortgage loan.\n\nThe owners of the nine-story, 1.5 million-square-foot mall with 170 stores at 865 Market Street pointed to a plunge in shoppers and sales post-pandemic.\nAt the same time, Seattle-based Nordstrom was poised to pull out of the half-empty mall, citing “unsafe conditions” for leaving a\n312,000-square-foot\nhole.\nThe part of downtown surrounding the mall has been\nchallenged\nwith quality-of-life and safety issues in the wake of the pandemic. A Denny’s on the ground floor of 818 Mission for nearly two decades\nclosed last year\n, adding to its vacant storefronts.\nA purchase of the vacant offices owned by Westfield would be a long-term play, brokers say.\nDespite the area’s challenges, it has “a lot of great infrastructure,” Carlson of Kennedy Wilson told the Chronicle, highlighting nearby parking, bus and BART stations, museums and the Moscone Convention Center. “The bones are there.”\n“The question is, are people OK with grabbing a big site like this and then waiting?” Kuiper of Colliers posed to the newspaper. “Because it may take five-plus years for the development world to come back, maybe longer.\n“But there are not a lot of high-rise opportunities in this kind of location with the ability for the builder to go really tall and do housing.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The deal gives United another 50 agents for a total of 1,500 agents in South Florida, a spokesperson said.\nFifty of Real Estate Authority’s 60 agents have signed up to join Charles Rutenberg Realty Fort Lauderdale, but that number is expected to rise, the spokesperson said. They’ll operate out of the company’s Fort Lauderdale office at 2201 Prospect Road. Charles Rutenberg Realty has about 1,200 agents.\nMichael Brownwell, founder of Real Estate Authority, will stay on as talent attraction specialist, focused on recruiting, according to a release.\n\nUnited Real Estate is active in 34 states and has more than 22,000 agents across the country. It was involved in deals totaling $26.3 billion in dollar volume last year, according to the release.\nThe merger is another sign of increased consolidation in the brokerage business, in part due to thinning margins.\nIn South Florida, eXp Realty\nrecently acquired\na 102-agent brokerage in Miami called OnePath Realty, and the 500-agent Aventura-based firm called Broker’s LLC. Locally, brokerages have been expanding beyond Miami-Dade and even the tri-county region, which has become more saturated.\nThe Keyes Family of Companies, which includes the Keyes Co. and Illustrated Properties, is the largest independently owned brokerage in the state with more than 3,000 agents. Last year,\nKeyes Company\nacquired a 24-agent firm called McCurdy &amp; Co. Realty in Fort Pierce, which is part of Florida’s Treasure Coast.\n",

    "content": "Howard Lutnick may have the president’s ear, but some in the administration and around Donald Trump are coming for his head.\nThe Commerce Secretary and former Cantor Fitzgerald head is bearing the blame for the tariff situation embroiling the nation, Politico\nreported\n. Lutnick is drawing increasing frustration from administration officials and Trump allies alike due to his close proximity with the president and economic counsel.\nLutnick hasn’t helped matters by seemingly overstepping on a number of occasions, sometimes contradicting the White House’s planned messaging. For instance, Lutnick said on “Meet the Press” that Americans should “absolutely not” brace for a recession, even though a taped interview where Trump refused to rule out the potential of a recession was about to air.\nHe also hinted on CNBC about a potential pause in\ntariffs\nfor Canada and Mexico while the administration was still negotiating with the countries.\n“He’s trying to be a mini-Trump. I don’t think he got the memo that only Trump gets to be Trump,” an administration source told Politico. “It just reinforces that he doesn’t really know how to do the job.”\n\nA White House spokesperson defended Lutnick as “an integral addition to the Trump administration’s trade and economic team,” pointing to the February jobs report as a feather in his cap. Lutnick did not comment.\nIt’s unclear if Trump is feeling the same frustration towards Lutnick that his allies are, given that  the latter joined the president on Air Force One over the weekend.\nBut it wasn’t long ago when Lutnick fell out of favor with others in Trump’s orbit during the transition, which Lutnick co-chaired. His control of the information flow to the president-elect reportedly\ndampened his chances\nto be Treasury Secretary.\nThe Dow fell substantially on both Monday and Tuesday as economic uncertainty ruled, along with a switch regarding tariffs on Canadian goods being flipped on and off at a nauseating pace. Lutnick helped negotiate a deal with Ontario Premier Doug Ford to suspend a threatened tariff on energy exports.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "A headquarters tenant at downtown Houston’s newest office building is investing in its lease.\nLaw firm Hicks Johnson is spending $4.3 million to build out its 17,500-square-foot space at the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nSkanska delivered the building last year; it was previously known as 1550 on the Green. It is the first major office building to open downtown since\nHines’ Texas Tower\nin 2021.\nHicks Johnson signed for a 13-year lease on the 19th floor of the tower in September. The buildout — including offices, meeting rooms and a mock courtroom — will begin this summer and wrap in the fall. Houston-based Kirksey Architecture is designing the space with O’Donnell/Snider Construction as general contractor.\nThe 28-story building is 50 percent leased between Hicks Johnson, Norton Rose Fulbright and\nBoston Consulting Group\n. The remaining space is being marketed to tenants looking for modern, amenity-rich office environments downtown.\n\nThe building has 375,000 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. It features three landscaped terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with lounge areas, a bar and conference space.\nThe move aligns with the firm’s plan to double its headcount from 20 to 40 lawyers over the next five years, Managing Partner Andrew Hicks said.\nThe firm is exiting TC Energy Center, at 700 Louisiana Street, whose ownership includesM-M Properties and an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust. It was built in 1983, and buildings of that era contribute the largest share of vacancy in Houston. Buildings constructed in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s average about 30 percent vacant, while those built since 2010 have an average vacancy under 14 percent as tenants seek new buildings with amenities to attract workers.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A historic Upper East Side townhouse just logged a price chop.\nThe property at 4 East 80th Street, known as the Woolworth Mansion, is asking just under $50 million — down roughly $10 million from its asking price when it hit the market in November, according to a listing on Realtor.com.\nIt’s a far cry from the\n$90 million\nthe sellers, the family of the late fitness mogul Lucille Roberts, sought when it listed in 2011, though the home hasn’t been offered for sale in more than a decade.\nThe discount comes as another Gilded Age mansion located one block away\nfound a buyer\nafter four years on the market. The townhouse at 973 Fifth Avenue landed a signed contract last month, just two weeks after the listing broker, Corcoran’s Carrie Chiang, lowered the asking price to $50 million.\nListing broker Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group said the Woolworth Mansion was the “best value” for a home of its size following the nearby sale, where he brought the buyer. He noted that the asking price works out to about $2,500 per square foot.\nRoberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, bought the Woolworth Mansion for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men’s Philanthropic League. The couple spent years restoring the home before Lucille’s death in 2003.\n\nThe Roberts family first tried to offload the property in 2011. Listed it for $90 million, the sprawling 20,000-square-foot mansion was the most expensive home on the market, and if it had sold for that price, would have made the priciest townhouse sale in New York City history.\nBut a deal never materialized, and the family pulled the townhouse off the market two years later. Before they stopped shopping the property, a disgruntled former employee of Lucille’s gyms was suspected of\nvandalizing the home\nin 2012 by throwing white paint on its exterior and shooting it with BB pellets.\nKevin Roberts, Bob and Lucille’s son, told the\nWall Street Journal\nhe lived in the home with his father until 2016. Bob left a few years later and now lives between the Hamptons and Palm Beach. The Roberts found a renter for the home in 2021 for $80,000 per month.\nFrank Woolworth, who made his fortune from “Five-and-Dime” stores, commissioned the Charles P.H. Gilbert-designed townhouse for his daughter, Helena Woolworth McCann, in 1915. He also had two adjacent homes built for his other children, all of which once formed a compound with his nearby property until it was demolished in the 1920s.\nThe 35-foot-wide mansion spans seven stories and has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and three kitchens. The home’s interior includes a mosaic floor, stained glass skylight, molding and a wood-paneled dining room fit for 50 people. It also features a gym, library, elevator, solarium and sauna.\n",

    "content": "Another historic office tower in downtown Chicago could soon join the city’s wave of residential conversions.\nAn investor group led by Tom Liravongsa has proposed converting the vacant office space in the Pittsfield Building into 214 residential units, Crain’s\nreported\n, citing a zoning application.\nLiravongsa, an investor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan,\nacquired 30 of the building’s 40 floors\nthrough a foreclosure sale in April 2023. His investment firm is L’Cre Global.\nThe conversion plan is aimed at upper office floors of the building at 55 East Washington Street, leaving untouched the 177 apartments already owned by Marc Realty on floors 13 to 21. Marc Realty has authorized the zoning application so long as the existing residential units remain unaffected. The building was the city’s tallest when it was constructed in 1927.\nIt would be the latest conversion in a trend that’s touched underutilized downtown office properties as the city grapples with remote work-driven office vacancies and\nstrong residential rental demand\n.\nOther projects in the pipeline, which have won city approval, include Campari Group’s conversion of\n79 West Monroe Street\n, two New York developers’\nplans for the Lightner Building\nat 1006 South Michigan Avenue, and Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE’s\nconversion at 135 South LaSalle Street\n.\n\nReviving the iconic Pittsfield Building will require overcoming a tight lending environment and the complexities of redeveloping historic properties.\nBesides that, the building is at the center of a\nlegal battle\nbetween a developer and the city.\n​​The building’s former owner, Miami-based Morgan Reed Group, filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and later sued the city, alleging that illegal downzoning stripped the property of value. The case was\nrecently set for trial\n.\nFurther complicating the building’s history, Chinese-Canadian investor Xiao Hua “Edward” Gong purchased Morgan Reed’s stake during bankruptcy proceedings but faced securities fraud charges in Canada, which froze his assets and stalled redevelopment.\nGong eventually\ndropped his yearslong lawsuit\ncontesting the foreclosure sale in November.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The firm’s minimum investment requirement rose to $62 million, and it was tasked with selling an additional 50 lots to third-party builders.\nHoque must purchase the site by May 12 and secure construction funding by August 10. Arthur Santa-Maria, vice president at Hoque, said the firm is on track.\nUniversity Hills, near the University of North Texas at Dallas and Interstate 20, is envisioned as a transformative project for Southern Dallas.\nPlans call for thousands of residential units, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and more than 50 acres of green space. The project could create a commercial hub in an area where median income levels are about 60 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth average.\n\nHoque faced scrutiny from delays on other projects, and Dallas officials said the city would terminate the agreement if the firm missed any deadlines.\nIt missed a deadline last year for vertical construction at its\n$50 million mixed-use project\nin Mansfield, and it was\nremoved as the master developer\nfor the Evans and Rosedale Urban Village in Fort Worth last April, after the city cited “unacceptable delays.”\nHoque contested those claims but did not reapply for the project.\nThe firm last year sold 580 lots in University Hills to D.R. Horton and Lennar for townhome and single-family development. It is also a partner in the proposed\n$350 million redevelopment\nof downtown Dallas’ Bank of America Plaza with Mike Ablon of PegasusAblon.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The Florida Legislature is considering bills this session that target two of the thorniest issues at condo and homeowners associations: alleged fraud and structural requirements.\nFor decades, some communities have been hotbeds for board members’\nalleged mismanagement and fraud\n. In the biggest fraud case in recent years, authorities in 2022 charged four former board members of the\nHammocks HOA\nand the husband of one of the ex-board members with misappropriating association funds to the tune of $2 million. The Hammocks, home to more than 18,000 residents in West Kendall, is South Florida’s biggest HOA.\nTo combat fraud, this legislative session’s bills seek to introduce an investigations pilot program and expand the powers of state oversight agencies.\nOther bills deal with hefty structural safety requirements imposed on condo associations following the deadly\nChamplain Towers South\ncollapse in Surfside in 2021. Since then, state lawmakers beefed up mandates in hopes of ensuring buildings’ safety. By the end of last year, all Florida condo associations were supposed to complete structural integrity reserve studies (SIRS). Starting this year, they are required to fully fund reserves. Condo associations also face milestone inspections once buildings reach 30 years, and every 10 years afterward.\nBut these requirements have proven to be a financial burden on unit owners. Many are getting hit with\nmultimillion-dollar special assessments\nto pay for repairs.\nBills proposed this session aim to give condo associations a reprieve from structural requirements, including giving options to finance repairs.\nThe legislative session started on March 4 and ends on May 2.\nSB 120/HB 137\nState lawmakers want to appoint an HOAs ombudsman, after they\nfailed to approve a similar proposal at last year’s session\n.\nCurrently, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) has less oversight over HOAs than condo associations. While DBPR’s administrative staff includes a condo ombudsman, the department does not have one for HOAs.\nUnder the proposed bills, the HOAs ombudsman will serve as a liaison among homeowners, boards of directors, association managers, DBPR and others, as well as develop policies and procedures so residents and boards understand their rights and responsibilities. The ombudsman will be able to mediate between homeowners and association leaders, as well as monitor and review complaints and recommend investigations by DBPR if election tampering is suspected.\nThe ombudsman also can appoint a board elections monitor if 15 percent of homeowners or six homeowners, whichever is greater, vote for this. The association would pay for the monitor.\nThe governor would appoint the ombudsman, who will have to be an attorney. The position will be within DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes.\nSen. Danny Burgess, a Republican whose district includes parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties, and Rep. Jervonte “Tae” Edmonds, a Democrat representing a portion of Palm Beach County, introduced the bills.\nSB 368\nThis bill again brings up an initiative Florida lawmakers failed to approve last year: a fraud investigation pilot program.\nThis year’s version is broader than that of last year, which only sought to create the program for condo associations. Under the latest bill, the state would initiate the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program for both condo and homeowners associations within the Florida Legal Affairs Department.\nThe bill aims to give HOAs a state ombudsman by expanding the existing condo association ombudsman’s powers to HOAs. The proposal will allow the ombudsman to void an election if voting issues are determined, request a court-appointed receiver for an association, issue subpoenas and conduct association audits.\nUnder the bill, the ombudsman would review complaints and decide which should be sent to the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program. If the staff of the pilot program determines the alleged wrongdoing is not within their purview, they would forward the complaint to DBPR’s condo, timeshares and mobile homes division.\nTo aid the pilot program’s investigation, the state will subpoena and audit association records. If sufficient evidence of corruption is found, complaints will be forwarded to state attorney’s offices.\nThe pilot program, which would sunset on Oct. 2, 2030, unless the legislature renews it, would be based in Miami-Dade County. It would be funded from DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund.\nThe bill’s other provisions include a requirement on condo associations to establish a searchable, cloud-based database with information about each association in Florida, including the names and contact information of board members; governing documents such as declarations and by-laws; annual budgets, including regular and special assessments, as well as their purpose; and copies of SIRS and other reports on a property’s physical condition.\nThe bill gives DBPR the right to levy fines on condo associations that fail to maintain insurance or a fidelity bond.\nFinally, the bill spells out procedures for HOAs to levy fines on homeowners, including that these fees can’t be more than $1,000, and levy suspensions on homeowners if they violate association declarations or by-laws. If a homeowner fixes a violation before his/her hearing, the association can’t levy the fine or suspension. If a homeowner cures an issue within 30 days after a hearing, the fine is halved and the suspension lifted. Also, fines won’t be due earlier than 30 days after a hearing. If a homeowner fails to pay a fine, the association also will be owed attorney fees.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sen. Ileana Garcia, a Republican who represents part of Miami-Dade.\nHB 983/SB 1600\nBoth bills say that a homeowner’s voting rights cannot be suspended when voting in a board recall. This includes lifting all previous suspensions to allow the homeowner to cast a recall ballot.\nThe proposals come as residents at some South Florida condo associations and HOAs have filed recall petitions, seeking to replace board members over various allegations, including mismanagement. In some cases, boards reviewing recall petitions deemed some homeowners’ votes invalid due to suspensions\nover reasons such as overdue assessments\n.\nUnder the bills, boards have to hold a meeting within five business days after receiving a recall petition to decide its validity.\nThe bills’ other proposals include that at least 20 percent of homeowners have to cast ballots in board elections for the elections to be valid.\nHB 983 also creates amenity dues at HOAs, which are different from assessments. Homeowners would pay the amenity dues to private owners of recreational facilities at HOAs to use these facilities.\nHB 983 was co-introduced by Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, and Rep. Meg Weinberger, a Republican representing a portion of Palm Beach County. Sen. Kristen Aston Arrington, a Democrat representing Osceola County and a portion of Orange County, introduced SB 1600.\nHB 913\nIn an attempt to enforce compliance with SIRS, a lawmaker proposes withholding coverage by\nCitizens Property Insurance\n, the state carrier of last resort, from condo associations that fail to meet structural integrity requirements.\nThe proposal comes as associations already have been struggling to obtain insurance due to several underwriters exiting the state and increased\npremiums and deductibles\nfrom the insurers still in Florida.\nThe bill also could be beneficial to developers who purchase a bulk of units at aging condo buildings and seek to dissolve the condo association. Specifically, the proposal eases the undoing of the association governing structure at buildings where repair costs exceed the property’s value.\nRep. Vicki Lopez, a Republican whose district includes Key Biscayne and parts of Miami, introduced the bill.\nSB 1742\nUnder this bill, condo associations can invest reserve funds in depository accounts for community, savings and commercial banks, or in credit unions.\nCondo boards are to create investment committees consisting of two board members and two unit owners who aren’t board members. The committee will recommend an investment adviser to be hired to manage reserve fund investment portfolios. Any interest earned on the portfolios that isn’t allocated for specific association uses has to be spent on capital improvements or maintenance.\nThe bill also aims to give a reprieve to condo associations facing higher expenses to meet structural integrity requirements. For budgets adopted prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, unit owners can vote for their association to obtain a line of credit to help cover reserve funds required under SIRS.\nSB 1742 also proposes that associations with budgets approved prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, that completed their milestone inspections in the previous two years, can temporarily pause reserve funding in order to finance repairs determined as necessary under the inspections. Associations that completed milestone inspections can delay their SIRS for up to two years to allow them to direct their funds to cover repairs.\nThe bill also aims to curb conflicts of interest between companies that conduct SIRS and contractors that do the repairs outlined as necessary under SIRS. It mandates that SIRS recommend reserve funding schedules in addition to determining necessary repairs.\nSen. Jennifer Bradley, a Republican representing the northern part of the state, introduced the bill. Her district includes part of Alachua County, as well as Baker, Bradford, Clay, Columbia, Gilchrist and Union counties.\nSB 690/HB 1415\nThe bills mark another attempt by state lawmakers to give condo associations a reprieve from the stricter structural integrity requirements imposed after the Surfside collapse.\nUnder the proposals, the SIRS requirement will be scaled back to condo buildings that are six stories or taller.\nAssociations for condo buildings that are five stories or shorter can elect, through a vote of unit owners, to waive funding reserves or to reduce reserve funding.\nSen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat representing part of Broward County, introduced SB 690, and Rep. Bruce Hadley Antone, a Democrat representing part of Orange County introduced HB 1415.",

    "content": "A megalisting priced at $175 million has hit the market in what’s been a drawn-out saga for a piece of Benedict Canyon once slated for a\nBulgari-branded hotel\n.\nThe 15-parcel listing includes the 9712 West Oak Pass Road address among several others in the hillside of Los Angeles. The listing states the property is located in Beverly Hills Post Office, a Los Angeles neighborhood north of the city of Beverly Hills. It also includes two single-family residences at 9800 Wanda Park Drive and 2534 Hutton Drive.\nRecords through PropertyShark and listing sites note the property is in pre-foreclosure after a notice of default was sent in November, alleging a $49.7 million unpaid balance at that time.\nThe notice of default indicates Motcomb Estates Ltd. provided a $30 million loan to 9712 Oak Pass Road LLC, which Florida state records show is tied to developer Gary Safady.\nMotcomb handles property investments for real estate investment and development firm Reuben Brothers, which is helmed by billionaires David and Simon Reuben.\nThe Agency’s Adam Rosenfeld and Feroz Taj have the listing and declined, through a brokerage spokesperson, to comment on the property outside of confirming only one seller is involved. Also marketing the property is Compass’ Carl Gambino.\nDavid Reuben Jr., Reuben Brothers principal and co-founder of Blackship Advisors, declined to comment. The Reubens’ attorney, Eric Orenstein of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, did not respond for comment.\nLuxe Ambitions\nThe mega-property was a point of contention a few years ago when Safady planned for a Bulgari-branded hotel.\nAn initial study for the project, when it was known as The Retreat at Benedict Canyon, called for a 59-room hotel along with eight single-family residences. The latter were to each total anywhere from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet, according to city planning documents.\nThe project drew the ire of some locals who were against the expected impacts of the large-scale construction project.\n\n“I believe we’ve taken the time to address all those issues,” Safady, who could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday, told\nVoyageLA\nin April 2023.\nA few months after that interview ran, then-\nCity Planning Director Vincent Bertoni\nwrote to Safady that the project’s impact to the area was far greater than originally expected, effectively ending the entitlement process for the resort.\nMike Gatto, an attorney for Safady, told the\nLos Angeles Times\nfollowing the city’s decision to axe the project it sent “a message to all looking to invest in Los Angeles that the city can’t be trusted to follow its own rules.”\nGatto, reached Tuesday afternoon, said he wasn’t aware of any backup development plans following the city’s 2023 decision, which is when his retainer agreement with Safady ended.\n“Usually when there is a presence of a NIMBY group in an area, they make it so that whatever somebody proposes is going to be tough. Those factors would have made it very hard to build anything there,” Gatto told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPricey Properties\nOak Pass Road now ranks as the third-priciest property on the market within Los Angeles County, according to Zillow records.\nThe county’s most expensive property currently for sale is Westside Estate Agency’s listing at 1261 Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills, which has a $195 million price tag. WEA founders Kurt Rappaport and Stephen Shapiro are marketing the property.\nAngelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, gets its name from Hyatt Hotel heir Anthony Pritzker who built the 50,000-square-foot mega mansion with his now ex-wife Jeanne Pritzker. It has 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\nThe next priciest property on the market is 607 Siena Way, which is priced at $177 million by The Beverly Hills Estates’ Branden Williams and Rayni Williams. The eight-bed, 25-bath Villa Siena estate spans 35,000 square feet and hit the market in February.\n",

The total outlay: $293 million.\nThe sprawling complex along the bluffs of Upper Newport Bay sits across Jamboree Road from the Fashion Island mall. The complex, built a half century ago by Gerson Bakar &amp; Associates, has 44 two- and three-story buildings, plus seven pools, a clubhouse and 10 sport courts.\nResidents of Park Newport have included actors Telly Savalas and Raquel Welch, and athletes Joe Torre, Bobby Riggs and Dennis Rodman.\nThe property is now owned by San Francisco-based Prado Group, according to the Business Journal. It’s not clear how Park Newport, or a Park Newport Land it said was involved in the expansion, are tied.\nPlans for the 6-acre expansion call for demolishing a leasing building, reflecting pool, tennis court and a 260-vehicle parking structure, as well as six apartments.\nThe landlord would then build 360 new apartments, including 285 market-rate units and 15 set aside for low-income tenants. The other 60 new apartments are “density bonus” residences, an indication of affordable housing units, according to the Business Journal.\n\nThe project would include 40 studio, 138 one-bedroom, 151 two-bedroom and 31 three-bedroom apartments, with an average size of 950 square feet. It would also include a 12,000-square-foot amenity space and 7,000 square feet of shops.\nThe expansion of the largest apartment complex near Fashion Island is the latest development among other multifamily projects in the works.\nLocally based Irvine Company recently proposed a combined 800 apartment units at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and Newport Center’s Block 100, a four-building multifamily project at 11 Newport Center Drive.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for very low-income and low-income households.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

They claim a fire exit on a centrally located stair, as practiced in Europe, is a far more manageable and “economically defensible” design.\n\nWhile common practice in European cities,\nSeattle has led the charge on single-stair reform\nin the U.S. Decades ago, the city tweaked its building code to allow for single-stair buildings up to six stories.\nWhile New York followed suit, Raman pointed out that\nSan Francisco\nand San Diego are also exploring single-stair rules after the passage of\nAssembly Bill 835\n, which directs the state fire marshal to develop standards for single-stair buildings by 2028.\nRaman’s motion seeks numerous reports on a single-stair regulation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department and the Planning Department, as well as the Livable Cities Initiatives and the American Institute of Architects.\nLikewise, the motion asks the Planning Department to report back on existing regulations in cities where single-stair buildings are allowed.\n“While the requirement for two stairwells was originally adopted for fire safety, developments over the past two to three decades have made such requirements obsolete,” explains\na landing page on the California YIMBY website\n. “Modern buildings across the U.S. and Europe have fire safety ratings that greatly exceed buildings with two staircases — even though they only have one staircase.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The five-story building was sold for $43.25 million in 2014, setting a record at $319 per square foot.\nThe owner is a subsidiary of New York REIT Global Net Lease.\nThe building, at 127 International Drive in Franklin’s Cool Springs area, was built-to-suit for the IRS in 2012 by New York-based Acquest Development. Valued at $4.6 million annually, the lease is expected to save the United States government less than $32 million, according to DOGE’s\nwebsite\n.\nThe lease termination is notable for its size and its implications in markets like Franklin, where large government tenants can drive valuations. Trump is\nat war with the IRS\n, which has been the sole tenant in the building.\n\nDOGE, which was created by President Donald Trump through executive order but lacks Congressional approval as an official agency, has focused on slashing vacant or underutilized federal leases across the country. Its “wall of receipts” website claims it has terminated 748 federal leases totaling 9.5 million square feet, including five in Middle Tennessee, as of March 11.\nFor Franklin and Cool Springs, the IRS lease termination removes one of its largest federal footprints and could reshape the area’s office market as the building seeks a new purpose or tenant.\nNashville’s office vacancy rate was 18 percent in the fourth quarter, lower than the then national rate of 20.4 percent, according to Colliers. The city\nset the pace for office demand\nlast year, but Franklin’s vacancy rate was 24 percent in 2023, according to CommercialCafe.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A mixed-use development is set to expand Fredericksburg’s Main Street.\nDC Partners, the developer behind Houston’s\nResidences at The Allen\nand the\nThompson San Antonio\nhotel, plans to develop The Meuse, a 22-acre project featuring retail, restaurants, tasting rooms and a small luxury hotel, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe development will rise near the intersection of Highway 290 and Main Street, adjacent to the city’s historic Klingelhoeffer House. Construction starts this spring, with completion anticipated by the end of 2027.\nThe project targets 73,200 square feet of destination and retail experiences designed to blend with Fredericksburg’s aesthetic appeal. The hotel brand hasn’t been revealed. Colliers’ Wade Green and Hannah Schiro are handling retail leasing.\nDallas-based Merriman Anderson Architects, the firm behind Dallas’ Statler Hotel revitalization, is leading design efforts, with Chicago-based Curioso handling the hotel interiors. Satterfield &amp; Pontikes, from Houston, is the construction manager.\nFredericksburg officials signaled their support for the project, saying it especially aligns with the city’s efforts to boost midweek tourism.\n\nThe Hill Country town has long been known for its small-town charm and robust tourism fueled by its wineries and German heritage. It was named one of the “most picturesque towns in America” by Reader’s Digest last year and received $1.4 million in American Rescue Plan funding in 2022 for infrastructure updates to accommodate swelling tourism.\nThe town was dubbed\n“the new Aspen”\nby Texas Monthly in 2021 for its high population of wealthy people and its part-time residents.\nCentral Texas is growing rapidly, and the Austin/San Antonio region is merging into a massive metro area.\nCrescent Real Estate is capitalizing on growing demand for upscale homes in the Texas Hill Country by developing a luxury residential project called Atten Hill in Horseshoe Bay, featuring 92 custom home sites on 114 acres, with prices starting around $500,000. The first phase will include 55 homes, and residents will enjoy exclusive amenities, including golf courses and a $40 million clubhouse.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Arson investigators are sifting through the ashes of a two-story industrial building to find the cause of the blaze that burned parts of nearby buildings in Downtown Los Angeles.\nIt took more than 100 Los Angeles firefighters on Monday to douse the early-morning fire that ignited in the graffiti-covered building at 1338 South Flower Street in South Park,\nCity News Service reported\n. It was snuffed out in an hour and 37 minutes.\nThe property appears to have been a two-story industrial building in front, backed by a 13,000-square-foot brick-and-timber warehouse, according to Loopnet and Google Maps.\nThe blaze was reported at 1:43 a.m. in the building between Venice and Pico boulevards, a couple of blocks east of the Los Angeles Convention Center and not far from Crypto.com Arena and L.A. Live, according to Margaret Stewart, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nFirefighters arrived and found flames erupting from two parts of the building, she said. Video showed flames through the roof, which the fire department said had been the site of a fire in November.\n\nCrews found heavy fire in the one-story portion at the back and were able to knock the bulk of the fire down in about 15 minutes.\n“However, the situation escalated as flames rapidly spread into the adjacent one-story commercial building,” Stewart said. “Approximately 20 minutes into the incident, smoke and fire were visible in a separate, one-story commercial building two doors to the south.”\nThe scores of firefighters managed to douse the blaze by 3:20 a.m. No injuries were reported. It’s not clear whether the building had been occupied.\n“They fought the heavy fire for over an hour and successfully defended two exposed buildings — an auto body shop and four-story apartment building to the rear,” Stewart said. “Occupants of the apartment building were able to safely shelter in place, and no evacuation was required.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The project would center around a five-story building featuring 7,500 square feet of retail — including a grocery store, cafe, community art center and pop-up retail — alongside 46 mixed-income residential units.\nThe project’s first phase would cost $39 million, funded by tax-increment financing, low-income housing tax credits, City of Chicago funds and a ComEd affordable housing grant. Subsequent phases would add more retail, residential units and outdoor community spaces.\nChicago Neighborhood Initiatives, with the Far South Chicago Community Development Corporation and designers Beehyyve and Gensler, proposed 1Fifteen at Michigan Station. It includes a four-story building with a 15,000-square-foot anchor grocery store, an 8,000-square-foot market hall for small businesses and 58 affordable apartments.\n\nAdditional phases envision retail, residential and community space, including townhomes and walk-up apartments surrounding a community park.\n1Fifteen’s initial phase is estimated to cost $48.3 million, supported by $15.8 million in tax credits, $26.7 million in government subsidies, $5.5 million in debt and $300,000 in philanthropic funds.\nBoth proposals emphasize sustainability and community connection and environmentally friendly elements, such as with solar panels, green roofs and rain gardens incorporated into their designs.\nThe city has opened the proposals to comment via an online survey. Residents can respond through March 21, but the city hasn’t said when the winner will be selected.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Developers trying to make lemonade out of the Trump administration’s plan to offload North Texas’ federal buildings will need a lot of sugar.\nThe General Services Administration’s list of buildings around the country that are burning a hole in the government’s pocket included five office buildings (and one small parking garage) in Dallas-Fort Worth totalling 1.7 million square feet.\nNone of them provide a quick and easy path to redevelopment.\nThe offerings include the mammoth Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building in downtown Fort Worth as well as three buildings in downtown Dallas, ranging from from 190,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet. There’s also a 317,000-square-foot building in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch.\nThe most exciting conversion prospect is the historic Santa Fe Federal Building at 1114 Commerce Street in downtown Dallas. Dallas developer Tanya Ragan could see it becoming a mixed-use project with a hotel, office, retail and most important, a “fabulous rooftop.”\n“It would be one of the best views in the city, because you’re adjacent to so many historic sites,” she said. “There are strict height restrictions and no obstructions.”\nThe expense, however, would be enormous. A transformation would require “incredible incentives” that city leadership might not support, she said.\nThe Farmers Branch building that’s home to an IRS office might be the most straightforward property from a marketing perspective, said Marcus &amp; Millichap veteran Ron Hebert. It’s a land play.\nIf the building at\n4050 Alpha Road\nwas torn down, the 9.44-acre plot would be “a great size for multifamily,” he said. The suburb’s school district is more desirable to Dallas’, he added, and that community would be more likely to tolerate rezoning.\n\n“You’d look out and see the stadium and the Green Belt. You could go walk around the college. It’s not a bad location,” he said.\nWhile it sits on a much smaller plot — 2.87 acres — the A. Maceo Smith Federal Building could also be a land play, Ragan said. The 189,000-square-foot office building at 525 South Griffin Street was built in 1971 and last renovated almost 15 years ago.\nBut its proximity to the convention center is a bonus, she said.\nIt could also work for an owner-user like a charter school or nonprofit organization, Partners’ Steve Triolet said.\nThe Terminal Annex, another mid-size property on the list, could also have a second life as an updated office building, Triolet said. Ragan pointed out that parking is bad at the location, and it’s on the National Registry of Historic Places, so it can’t be easily torn down.\nWhile downtown Fort Worth’s Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building has the benefit of a desirable location, its massive size and layout might make it an albatross of a development project.\nIt could be suitable for a multi-tenant conversion or repurposed into a mixed-use office space, Triolet said.\nRegardless of the fate of these properties, Ragan worries they’ll mess with comps if the government opts for a fire sale.\n“That is going to come up for conversation for everything else that is out there on the market,” she said.\n",

    "content": "New allegations tied to a mortgage fraud scandal that rocked the industry and landed an executive in federal prison now implicate JPMorgan, the lender on the deal, and the borrower — New York’s Chetrit Group.\nWells Fargo, which filed suit in federal civil court as trustee on a $481 million CMBS loan, alleges JPMorgan knew the mortgage it made to\nChetrit\nfor a national multifamily portfolio was based on inflated financials. But it doled out the debt anyway.\nThe suit — first reported by Reuters — also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into\nmortgage fraud\n. In 2023, Roco principal\nTyler Ross\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\nWells Fargo’s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers’ fraud.\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself “a victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.”\n“Financial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,” said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n“We suffered great financial loss due to the seller’s fraud,” the spokesperson said. “As a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.”\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco’s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\n\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.\nThe Chetrits then brought the fraudulent financials to JPMorgan’s attention.\nInternally, the lender acknowledged the reporting was unreliable, according to the complaint. An analyst handling due diligence on the deal texted a colleague that the financial statements were “‘made up’” and “‘ridic[ulous],’” the suit details.\nUltimately, the 10,000-unit portfolio traded for $522 million, the suit states. The deal was risky — a $481 million loan on a $522 million acquisition shakes out to an incredible 92 percent loan-to-value ratio. But JPMorgan knew it would insulate itself from problems by immediately securitizing the deal, and pocket millions of dollars in fees to boot, according to the lawsuit.\nJPMorgan “was willing to issue such a risky loan because it never intended to hold it,” the suit said. Rather, the risk would be passed on to the deal’s unwitting bondholders, who now face tens of millions of dollars in losses, the suit alleges.\nWells Fargo argues JPMorgan “had an obligation” to validate whether the figures were accurate.\nChetrit defaulted on the debt in 2022 after the deals failed to generate sufficient cash flow to\nservice the loan\n. In early 2023, a spokesperson for the firm said it was looking to sell assets to right the ship.\nThe firm nabbed a temporary forbearance agreement in June 2023 but defaulted on the terms just a few months later, according to Morningstar Credit. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 and the past year has seen a spate of foreclosures: four Texas properties, three in Alabama, seven in Mississippi, according to Morningstar.\nPre-foreclosure filings in Florida, Ohio, Arkansas and Louisiana are pending, as of last month.\nMeanwhile, the Wells Fargo suit seeks to hold Meyer Chetrit, the guarantor on the debt, personally liable for the potential tens of millions in losses to the trust.\nThe trustee demands JPMorgan either repurchase the loan or pay damages to cover the trust’s losses.\n",

    "content": "Lafayette, a city of $2 million homes, has played a shell game with state housing regulators to avoid building its share of affordable housing.\nThat’s the contention of the Housing Action Coalition, a San Francisco-based housing advocate that is suing the East Bay city for creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nThe coalition accuses the city of “pretending” to comply with the planning blueprint, known as the housing element, required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint filed by Farella Braun and Martel a San Francisco-based law firm.\nIn one case, the city said a CVS will be torn down and rebuilt into 26 homes — but CVS has a long-term lease, with no intention of moving, according to the lawsuit. Other examples were not disclosed.\n“We hoped that Lafayette would take its responsibility to plan for housing seriously, but instead, they passed a housing element that deliberately ignores the facts,” Ali Sapirman, the advocacy and policy manager with the Housing Action Coalition, told the Chronicle. “Lafayette is continuing a pattern of obstruction, using questionable calculations to block much-needed housing while pretending to comply with state law.\n“The housing crisis is severe, and every city, including Lafayette, must do its fair share,” Sapirman added.\n\nIn its housing plan, Lafayette proposed using city-owned parking lots for housing, as well as sites downtown and at religious institutions to build affordable housing. The city projects that 27 accessory dwelling units will be built each year, for a total of 216 units.\nOfficials also said more than 150 units were under construction, with another 570 approved units in the development pipeline.\nThe city didn’t immediately return a request for comment by the newspaper.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group attempting to stop the development, allowing it to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019 — according to its housing element plan.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In January, the firm snapped up an 91,000-square foot building in a lender sale at 1440 Broadway in downtown Oakland for\n$5.5 million, or $60 per square foot\n, 86 percent less than its previous sale.\nFrontline founder Rob Mann described 1440 Broadway as the type of building he wanted to acquire more of: a well-located asset “with significant potential to create value through thoughtful repositioning and patience.”\nFrontline Realty Capital, founded in 2016, invests in industrial, retail and office properties in the Bay Area, Inland Empire and select western markets, according to its website.\nHudson Pacific Properties, founded in 2009 by Victor Coleman, owns 2.4 million square feet of property in San Francisco, after a buying spree in the early 2010s, according to a regulatory filing. It’s selling\nfour office buildings for up to $150 million\nas it struggles with hundreds of millions in financial losses.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Green Brick owns five subsidiary homebuilders in Texas, including CB JENI Homes, Normandy Homes, Southgate Homes and a 90 percent interest in Centre Living Homes, according to its website.\n\nThe acquisition follows Green Brick’s September purchase of 557 acres along FM 1385 in northern Denton County, where it plans to build 2,200 homes near Pilot Point. The company cited the extension of the Dallas North Tollway to G.A. Moore Parkway as a factor in the area’s growing appeal to homebuyers.\nPrices are expected to start below $400,000. In February, the median home price in Denton County was about $480,000, in Cooke County it was $400,000 and in Grayson County it was $350,000, according to Realtor.com.\nFrom mid-2020 to mid-2023, the population in Denton County jumped 11.2 percent, increased 5.1 percent in Cooke County and 8.4 percent in Grayson County, census data shows.\nDenton County’s population surpassed 1 million in 2023, with nearly 30,000 new residents in a single year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A prominent real estate developer may be preparing to enter the race to be the next mayor of Boston.\nThomas O’Brien, managing partner of HYM Investment Group, is weighing a bid to supplant Michelle Wu at the top of the city’s political ranks, the Boston Globe\nreported\n. O’Brien has not officially announced a campaign for the election, which will take place in November.\nO’Brien would likely run as a Democrat. The top two vote-getters for mayor in preliminary voting in September would battle in a runoff two months later.\n“It is clear some developers are willing to do whatever it takes to buy this office,” read a statement from the Wu reelection campaign.“It seems like Josh Kraft is not turning out to be what they expected and now they are shopping for a new option.”\nResidents and business leaders have called O’Brien to express concern about fiscal health, rising property taxes, affordable housing and the quality of the city’s public school system. The commercial real estate community has lately grown frustrated with Wu, particularly her attempts to\nraise commercial property tax rates\nwhile capping rent hikes for residences.\nO’Brien has a number of important real estate developments in the works with HYM. The firm is spearheading the redevelopment of Suffolk Downs and the Government Center Garage. The firm also won the bid to develop a parcel in Roxbury into a life sciences hub and housing.\n\nProminent projects for HYM, which launched in 2009, also include Boston Landing in Brighton, NorthPoint in Cambridge and Bulfinch Crossing in downtown Boston.\nO’Brien — brother of Boston College football coach Bill O’Brien — served the city for five years at the city planning and development agency under Thomas Menino in the 1990s. He resigned after a scandal erupted over a senior agency aide buying a subsidized condo intended for low-income families.\nAnother candidate with a football connection, Josh Kraft — son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft —\nlaunched his campaign\nlast month. The philanthropist is honing in on rent control and more affordable housing while distancing from his father’s ties to Donald Trump.\nWu will be difficult to beat in the fall, as no incumbent mayor in the city has lost a re-election campaign in more than 75 years.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Even “desolate.”\nThen came a\nflood\nof new restaurants, coffee shops and stores, filling the streets with people.\nWith increased popularity, landlords also have boosted rents.\nSouthern Land’s project site\nused to be mostly vacant land, with a shuttered commercial building that had broken windows, graffiti and homeless sleepers.\nThe company is now building three seven-story buildings there with a two-story fitness center, a rooftop deck and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants. The firm expects to open early next year, according to Southern Land development manager Alex Woodin.\n\nWoodin said his firm began looking at the Arts District four years ago, noting its walkability.\n“It felt good, it felt right,” he told the Review-Journal.\nCedar Street Companies and Bridge Investment Group have also broken ground, and have said they expect to open by next summer. The seven-story complex will include a large fitness center, a resort-style spa, including saunas, and ground-floor shops and restaurants.\nSouthern Land, founded in 1986 by Tim Downey, has built apartments and homes from New York to Nevada, according to its website.\nCedar Street Companies, founded in 2009 by Alex Samoylovich, Will Murphy and Mark Heffron, has $4 billion in assets under management, including 7,500 apartments across numerous markets, including Chicago, San Diego, Portland, Minneapolis and Cleveland, according to a release.\nBridge Investment Group, an alternative investment firm founded in 2009, had $49.4 billion of assets under management as of September 2023. The firm went public in 2021.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Multifamily landlords have the upper hand over Chicago renters, and that’s not likely to change for years as apartment leasing prices are set to soar amid a cliffdrop for development.\nThe city’s downtown apartment market reached new heights last year, when the average unit within a group of 84 buildings tracked by Luxury Living surpassed $3,000 for the first time ever, according to the multifamily brokerage and consultant. The mean figure landed at $3,077, up 28 percent from 2023, with units in the Streeterville neighborhood — which holds the largest average floorplans of downtown areas — commanding the most-expensive average rent at $3,648.\nLandlords and their leasing teams pushed prices to the new milestone despite smaller units — studios and convertibles, in particular — making up a larger share of deals last year, Luxury Living found.\n“Knowing how minimal the new supply pipeline is, it’s easy to see demand will continue to go up. Retention will be high,” said Aaron Galvin, Luxury Living’s founder and a developer of the Saint Grand, a 248-unit tower in Streeterville that was being leased last year after opening to residents.\nLease signings increased 33 percent last year within the buildings studied, up to 14,086 from 10,600 in 2023. But there’s little carryover of new, move-in ready units into this year. In fact, only about 500 units are expected to come online this year, down from the 10-year average of more than 3,500 units, according to Integra Realty Resources. Historically low vacancy rates are the anticipated result.\n“Rents are expected to spike in 2025,” Integra said in its outlook.\nThe next two years aren’t so promising for renters, either, as developers are constrained by tight capital markets, rising construction costs and, most recently, increased uncertainty over material costs as President Trump threatens major trading partners with tariffs.\n\n“Developers indicate virtually every deal remains in a holding pattern until at least mid-2025,” Integra said, noting that the next wave of deliveries won’t occur until 2027 at the earliest.\nBehind Streeterville, the next-priciest downtown Chicago submarkets are River North, Gold Coast/Old Town and the West Loop/Fulton Market, which are the only others with average unit rents in excess of $3,000. The Loop was the only neighborhood where renters might have caught a break last year, with the average lease signed decreasing slightly to $2,848, down from $2,872 in 2023, Luxury Living found. The South Loop and River West respectively trailed those neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, the average unit size stayed fairly flat last year, at 781 square feet, up from 777 in 2023, but tenants opted far more often for studio and convertible units, forsaking the extra space offered by one-bedroom layouts in exchange for a break on cost, Galvin said. Rents per square foot were up 2.1 percent to $3.94 last year.\n“That’s coming down to attainability in terms of income that we’re seeing in the market,” Galvin said. ​​”There are just that many more people making enough money to qualify for studios and convertibles, as compared to one-beds.”\nRenters of smaller units are also less likely to need parking, he said, which developers are noting as they plot their return to the market from the slowdown.\n“When you’re looking at construction costs and how to get the development pipeline turned on again, less parking is likely to be more of a trend moving forward,” Galvin said.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated to correct the rents per square foot figure.\n",

The impact fees are meant to help districts fund expansions and improvements to accommodate the growth.\nNegotiations stalled over a massive gap in expectations. Fremont School District 79 is seeking $50 million from Wirtz to help fund a new $150 million elementary school, while Wirtz’s legal team has countered with an estimate closer to $5 million.\nIn recent weeks, tensions have spilled into the public. School officials accused the village of sidelining them during negotiations and criticized Wirtz for underestimating the project’s potential strain on schools.\nMundelein Mayor Steve Lentz responded by accusing the districts of trying to “embarrass” the high-profile Wirtz family into paying more than what Illinois law requires. Lentz also emphasized that municipalities, not school districts, are responsible for negotiating impact fees.\n",

    "content": "Related California plans to build a 41-story office building and hotel in San Francisco while nearly two out of five city workplaces sit empty.\nFor the Irvine-based developer, it’s all in how you crunch the numbers for the proposed office-hotel tower at 530 Sansome Street, in the North Financial District across from the Transamerica Pyramid near Jackson Square,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nYes, overall office vacancy across the city hovers at a dismal 37 percent.  Yes, the top five buildings have a 16 percent vacancy.\nBut when you pull away the drapes, the city’s true office trophies with views from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge command a vacancy of 6.9 percent — the target for the Related venture.\n“Right building in the right location at the right time,” Matt Witte, executive vice president of acquisitions and development for Related California, told the Chronicle.\n“This started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of COVID, it doesn’t seem so contrarian any more,” added Gino Canori, president of Related California. “It’s a story about San Francisco’s recovery, about the city coming out of a tough time and building something everyone can be proud of.”\nPlans call for a 544-foot tower with 360,000 square feet of offices atop a five-star, 200-room hotel, plus a new firehouse at 447 Battery Street to replace a station swallowed up by the project. A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\nThe city is expected to publish an environmental study on Tuesday, March 11. Related hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, the gleaming glass rectangle could be completed by 2030.\nIt would be the first new North Financial District building since 350 Bush Street opened in 2018, and the first new five-star hotel in 30 years, according to the Chronicle. It’s expected to cost\n$600 million\n.\n\nThe tower, designed by Chicago-based SOM, would anchor a block across from the Transamerica Pyramid, which New York-based Michael Shvo revamped, investing $1 billion. Rents for top-floor offices in the area are north of $200 a square foot, more than three times the city average.\nIt would also be built next to Jackson Square — the hot spot in San Francisco’s glacial rebound.\nRelated California, a unit of New York-based Related Companies, “did a lot of homework,” touring buildings and digging into leasing data, Canori said.\nAs it hoovered up information, it grew convinced there was demand for a new building with “killer views” and features that top tenants want  — meeting rooms and workout facilities and outside terraces and swank restaurants.\nSuch amenities not only help recruit and retain talent. They attract them to a return-to-office.\nThree North Financial District tenants have leases expiring in 2030 who are “taking a very close look” at the proposed building, Canori told the newspaper, which “is further emboldening our ability to press ahead with getting the project approved and started.\n“We think the market is there,” he declared.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Two new long-term retail leases have been signed at Mission Rock, and a long-awaited French bakery has opened its doors in the development.\nBlue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have both signed 10-year leases at the 28-acre Mission Bay development, which is owned by the Port of San Francisco and was formerly a parking lot for the Giants, according to a news release Tuesday from developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\nThe development team is now wrapping up its first phase with two apartment buildings and two office towers, one of which is Visa’s market support center, which provides resources for the credit card company’s clients and businesses globally.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the Visa building at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. The 13-story tower houses nearly 1,000 Visa employees, according to the company’s website.\nSalad and grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing. A representative for Tishman Speyer said that the developer anticipates both Sweetgreen and Blue Bottle will be submitting their permits shortly. The rep declined to give any further information on tenant improvement allowances or lease terms.\nCBRE’s Alex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented Mission Rock Partners. Blue Bottle was represented by Benzi Blatman with CBRE, while Sweetgreen was represented by AJ Schrader with Tier One Retail Group.\nSagues called Mission Bay “the most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco.” He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because “it is a true seven-day neighborhood,” with office, life science, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\nBeloved French bakery Arsicault, known as much for its long lines as its buttery pastries, was announced as a retail tenant in Mission Rock\nin the summer of 2023\nand just opened this week. It is the San Francisco pastry-makers’ third location, after expanding from its original location in the Inner Richmond into Civic Center in 2020. It signed a 10-year lease for nearly 2,500 square feet at the base of the Verde apartment tower in Mission Bay, according to the developers. At least to start, its Mission Rock offerings will be the same as at their other locations.\n\n“Our bakery honors traditional pastry-making techniques while Mission Rock represents San Francisco’s vibrant future,” Arsicault owner Armando Lacayo said in a statement. “The combination feels perfect for this community where tradition and innovation blend together seamlessly.”\nIn a statement, San Francisco Giants vice president of real estate development Julian Pancoast called the arrival of Arsicault, and signing of Blue Bottle and Sweetgreen leases, “exceptional additions” that were “carefully selected” to “enhance our vision of being a welcoming destination for all to enjoy.”\nA Giants representative added that it is important to “curate” a variety of brands and concepts for the neighborhood to hit a wide range of price points and tastes.\n“Our goal is to create a dynamic retail ecosystem that supports daily residents and office users while making Mission Rock a destination people visit often, for a variety of experiences,” the rep said via email.\nAdditional retailers will continue to be announced on a rolling basis, according to the press release. So far, much like Arsicault, the strategy seems to be to bring in mostly local brands with an avid following, but without a Mission Bay presence.\nIke’s Love &amp; Sandwiches, LuxFit gym and Proper Food all opened in Mission Rock last summer. The first permanent outpost of Quik Dog, a burger restaurant that began during the pandemic as a temporary-take out window at renowned Mission cocktail bar Trick Dog, will also open in the coming months. So will Flour + Water Pizza Shop, and a full-service restaurant from the team behind Che Fico on Divisadero. The new Che Fico restaurant will presumably have more offerings than the Che Fico Pizzeria that opened blocks away at Chase Center’s Thrive City last fall.\nIt’s not the only crossover between the Golden Gate Warriors’ home stadium and Mission Rock. The Warriors confirmed that the team\nwould be taking 71,000 square feet\nin Mission Rock’s Building B. It was the first lease signed in the nearly 300,000-square-foot building, which was\nbuilt as life sciences space\nbefore pivoting back to traditional office space.\n",

    "content": "The African American Sports and Entertainment Group is poised to buy half of the Oakland Coliseum after the county received needed paperwork before it finalizes a sale.\nThe Sacramento-based developer submitted a couple of key documents to purchase Alameda County’s half of the 112-acre stadium complex at 7000 South Coliseum Way, in East Oakland,\nFox2 KTVU reported\n.\nIn January, Alameda County Supervisors voted to enter into talks with the developer to buy the county’s share of the former home of the Oakland A’s, decamping to Las Vegas. The cost: $125 million.\nTo move forward, the county said last week it needed two documents from the would-be buyer: a quit-claim deed and a release related to litigation,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nCounty Supervisor David Haubert\ntold Fox2 KTVU on Friday\nthe documents were received, signaling a big step forward in the sale.\nThe county also expected to get them in time to approve a sale on Tuesday, March 11.\nThe county had asked the entertainment group to hold a $100 million insurance policy to cover unspecified costs after closing. The entertainment group made a counter offer to hold a $30 million policy for the next two years, which the county had yet to accept late last week.\nCity staff were concerned that a paperwork delay could cause investors to pull their funding and kill the redevelopment deal. The entertainment group and Loop Capital, a major Black-owned investment firm based in Chicago, could not be reached by the Business Times for comment.\n\nCounty negotiators said they had expected to have the required paperwork to allow for final approval from supervisors on Tuesday,\naccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n.\nThe Coliseum complex includes the stadium, the arena, administrative offices and acres of parking. The entertainment group’s proposed\n$5 billion redevelopment\nproject calls for homes, hotels, a convention center, youth amphitheater, restaurants and museums, while retaining the aging stadium.\nIn 2019, the A’s bought the county’s share of the site for $85 million, and were in the process of paying for it when the team left Oakland for Las Vegas.\nIn July, the entertainment group agreed to buy the city’s share of the Coliseum property for\n$105 million\n.\nIn August, the MLB franchise struck a deal with the entertainment group to sell its stake for\n$125 million\n, which required final approval by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "FPA Multifamily’s suburban buying streak hauled in a property with an assumable loan.\nChicago’s Rockwell Partners sold the 356-unit Huntington Apartments, at 20 South Naper Boulevard in Naperville, for $68 million to San Francisco-based FPA Multifamily, Crain’s\nreported\n. That’s $191,000 per unit.\nFPA assumed the balance of Rockwell’s existing mortgage, about $39.8 million, which carries an interest rate under 3.6 percent and matures in 2029. The assumable debt likely sweetened the deal, as interest rates for this type of asset hover near 5.22 percent.\nNewmark brokers Susan Lawson, Chuck Johanns and Elizabeth Gagliardi represented Rockwell in the transaction.\nThe deal also reflects the growing appeal of DuPage County, which investors view as less burdensome for property taxes as Cook County.\nRental demand is strong, with median net rent rising 4.4 percent year over year in the fourth quarter to $2.90 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\nHuntington Apartments, built in 1973. Originally apartments, it was converted to condos in 2007, but units failed to sell amid the 2008 financial crisis.\nRockwell acquired 313 units for $34 million in 2016 and spent the next few years buying the remaining 43 units and converting the property back to rentals. Rockwell invested close to $50 million into the acquisition and property upgrades, including $7 million to renovate 90 percent of the units and enhance amenities like the clubhouse.\nFPA Multifamily has been an active investor in the Chicago-area market.\nLast month it\nsold the 294-unit ReNew Downers Grove apartments\nfor $72.1 million, and last year acquired properties in\nHoffman Estates\nand\nChicago’s South Loop\nfor more than $100 million each.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Prologis has moved forward with plans to redevelop a former Greyhound bus station in Downtown Los Angeles into an entertainment studio campus.\nThe San Francisco-based industrial developer had a new planning study published last month by Los Angeles planners for the nearly 9-acre production campus at 1716 East 7th Street,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n.\nPlans for the 364,000-square-foot studio campus, dubbed Alameda Crossing, include four buildings with nine soundstages, more than 132,000 square feet of ancillary offices, 57,000 square feet of production support facilities and parking for 718 cars.\nThe developer has apparently revised its plans since 2022, when it proposed to build 291,000 square feet of studios, offices and support facilities, 10 soundstages and a parking garage for 941 cars.\nOff the table from its initial proposal is a plan to redevelop the former bus terminal at the southeast corner of 7th and Alameda streets into a logistics hub for research firms.\nThe latest plan includes a ground-floor commissary and cafe on 7th Street, as well as terrace decks overlooking the Downtown skyline and the Los Angeles River.\n\nThe project, designed by Chicago-based SOM, would be as tall as 132 feet, with “long, simple buildings with an expressed structural or construction logic,” ringed by a decorative fence and trees. The six-story studio offices would contain floor-to-ceiling windows and broad white eaves, supported by round vertical pillars, according to a rendering.\nPending approvals, Prologis would break ground in 2027 and be completed by 2029.\nPrologis bought the former bus terminal in 2021 for\n$91 million\n. Greyhound has moved its L.A. buses to\nUnion Station Patsaouras Transit Plaza\n.\nThe project is one of three large studio developments in the works along the Alameda corridor in Downtown Los Angeles, following similar projects at\n6th\nand\n8th Streets\n, according to Urbanize.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",
