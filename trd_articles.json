        "content": "It may be one of the country\u2019s most sprawling metros, but Houston has a surprisingly\nnarrow\nluxury market for single-family homes.\nNine of the 10 most expensive homes sold in Harris County this year are strung along the Buffalo Bayou, and five of these are within one square mile of each other in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Contrast Travis County, home to the denser, more constricted city of\nAustin\n, where the top 10 deals fan out westward from downtown as far as Bee Cave and Horseshoe Bend, which are up to 20 miles away.\nDallas-Fort Worth\nrivals Space City in geographic grouping \u2014\u00a0 none of the top 10 homes sold this year in the Metroplex is more than a mile and a half from the Dallas North Tollway \u2014 but Houston may be home to the clubbiest luxury resi market.\nIn Houston, the buyers and sellers of the top 10 deals shared 10 agents over just five brokerages. Austin and Dallas were far more diverse, with 18 different agents apiece represented in the top 10 deals for each city.\nThe home that topped the list reflects a trend that became more pronounced in Houston this year: As the wobbliness of the resi market finally infected the luxury set, some pockets were immune, including\nhistoric homes\n. The most expensive home sold in Houston in 2025 was built in 1938 by legendary Houston architect John Staub. Of the top ten, three were built in the last two years.\nHere are the top 10 residential sales of the year in Harris County, based on TRD Data and Redfin. Since Texas is a non-disclosure state, the final sales prices aren\u2019t public; the list is sorted by last listing price.\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $19 million\nThis gated estate, which is one of the 31 River Oaks homes Staub designed between 1924 and 1958, sold in the hot season when it was asking $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. The 9,400-square-foot main house, remodeled in 2000, shares 1.6 acres with a guest apartment and an entertainment pavilion built in 2012. The estate of Larry Brookshire, former owner of Fisk Electric, sold the property to philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade. Compass Real Estate agents Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes and Laura Sweeney, two of the city\u2019s top producers, represented the seller and buyer, respectively.\n2307 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $16 million\nDown the street is the silver medal sale,\nanother River Oaks historic mansion\n. Steel industry mogul Daniel Benditz sold the 11,200-square-foot home built in 1952 to a trust in November. The six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home was last listed for $16 million, or about $1,400 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Sweeney represented both parties in the transaction.\n3996 Inverness Drive, Houston | $14 million\nInverness Drive fielded two of the year\u2019s top sales in May\n, and Nan &amp; Co founder Nancy Almodovar represented both listings. The first was a Tudoresque mansion at 3996 Inverness, which was listed for just under $14 million, or about $843 per square foot, when it sold. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home built in 2011 is the largest on the list, with more than 16,600 square feet. The property had previously been listed for $17.9 million in 2024.\n1 Longfellow Lane, Houston | $10.6 million\nAn outlier among the top 10 homes\n, the five-bedroom, five-bathroom, 9,800-square-foot property at 1 Longfellow Lane is the only one south of I-69. The sellers, Kenneth and Cara Moczulski, were recognized by Preservation Houston in 2021 for restoring the home built in 1926, designed by Rice University architect and professor William Ward Watkin. Rancher and political donor Ashley Watt bought the property. The Moczulskis originally listed the home at $11.8 million in April 2023. Martha Turner Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Victoria Minton had the listing, and Guggenheim Howes represented the buyer.\n11264 Memorial Drive, Houston | $10 million\nThis Piney Point spec mansion was built in 2024 by the seller, an entity managed by Ghandi Saad. Guggenheim Howes and fellow Compass agent Nasseim Saad shared the listing, and Guggenheim Howes also represented the buyers, Dani Bidros and Shaghayegh Nikkhah. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home sold on June 30 when it was listed for $10 million, which comes out to about $815 per square foot for the 12,200-square-foot property.\n813 W Friar Tuck Lane, Houston | $10 million\nLocal custom builder Rob Ryan completed this home \u2014 that required the teardown of a home built in 1950 \u2014 in July and sold it to Robert Micah McDonald in September, according to public records. The 9,000-square-foot home is on a 1.7-acre lot on Friar Tuck Lane, a Memorial neighborhood street which\nfrequently\nappears\nin coverage of Houston\u2019s most expensive homes. The asking price amounts to about $1,100 per square foot. Sweeney represented both the buyer and the seller.\n11321 Green Vale Drive, Houston | $9.8 million\nAnother spec mansion, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 11321 Green Vale Drive was built by Thompson Custom Homes in 2024 and sold to Wilber and Judy Baker in February. At the time of the sale, the home was listed for $9.8 million, or about $900 per square foot for the 10,799-square-foot home.\n4004 Inverness Drive, Houston | $8.85 million\nHouston architect Charles Tapley designed the 1974 home at 4004 Inverness Drive, down the street from the third-most expensive home on the list. Jacquelyn Fisher, owner of Houston-based moving company 3 Men Movers, sold the property to Jentry Kelley and Kenneth Shawn Lynch in May. At the time of the sale, the seller asked $1,180 per square foot.\n19 West Lane, Houston | $8.5 million\nOn a 0.9-acre lot, this five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, 10,800-square-foot home, built in 2000, was listed at $8.5 million when it sold, or about $785 per square foot. Yun Bo Li sold the property to Thomas and Barbara Skeuse in March, according to public records. Compass agent Mike Mahlstedt had the listing.\n302 Timberwilde Lane, Houston | $8.25 million\nThe mid-century home at 302 Timberwilde Lane may just survive after being purchased by Kelly Barnhart, a local restaurateur with a background in art history. The house built in 1956 was marketed as a teardown opportunity, with William Wheless of Wheless Realty calling the 2.73-acre property \u201cone of the last remaining building sites\u201d on Timberwilde, a street whose other properties include the home at\n412 Timberwilde\n, listed for $12.25 million, and the\nLodge at Hunters Creek\n, a palatial estate asking $60 million. The house at 302 Timberwilde has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 7,400 square feet, making the asking price about $1,100 per square foot.\nNot bad for a teardown\n.\n",

        "content": "As Pebblebrook Hotel Trust chairman and chief executive Jon Bortz previously told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cL.A. is a difficult market to sell in today due to unfriendly government policies and the lagging impact from the fires, strikes, ICE, National Guard.\u201d\nThe City of Los Angeles has its share of the regionwide challenges of homelessness and a specific $30 minimum wage for hotel workers and property transfer tax that seems to have investors looking to neighboring municipalities for deals. The transfer tax, known as Measure ULA, didn\u2019t come into play on our ranking of the priciest hotel sales in Los Angeles County because they were all either in other cities or were bought out of foreclosure.\nHere are Los Angeles County\u2019s top five hotel sales in 2025 based on the publication\u2019s analysis of public records and prior reporting.\nThe Line\n3515 Wilshire Boulevard\nLos Angeles\nCorten Real Estate Partners\npurchased\nThe Line in Koreatown for $68 million. The 384-key hotel was developed in 2014 by an entity connected to billionaire investor Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa Companies. Yucaipa secured a $100 million\nloan\nfrom Corten but later defaulted \u2014 then the lender made the buy. The distressed deal came out to $177,000 a room. No transfer taxes were paid due to the change of title via foreclosure.\nThe Montrose\n900 Hammond Street\nWest Hollywood\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust\nsold\nthe 133-key Montrose hotel in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million. The boutique hotel, near Sunset Boulevard, traded for about $333,000 a room. The company did not disclose the buyer at the time of sale, but a person familiar said it is a high-net-worth individual who has roots in Los Angeles, believes in its future and shops bargains in distressed markets. We now know that is Daniel Negari, founder and chief executive of XYZ, according to property records. He recently purchased two Irvine Company office towers in Downtown San Diego at a discount before the giant made its\nexit\n.\nThe Surfrider\n23033 Pacific Coast Highway\nMalibu\nLuxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe Surfrider, a 20-key Malibu hotel, for $37.5 million. At about $1.9 million a room, it was California\u2019s priciest per-key deal all year, and one of the priciest ever. The seller of the luxe, oceanfront hotel at 23033 Pacific Coast Highway was Dauntless Capital Partners.\nMaison 140 &amp; the Mosaic\n140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive\nBeverly HIlls\nMalta-based Corinthia Group and Kuwait-based Action Real Estate\npurchased\ntwo Beverly Hills hotels \u2014 the 44-room Maison 140 and the 49-room Mosaic Hotel \u2014 for $35 million. That comes out to roughly $376,000 per key. The seller of the two hotels, at 140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive, is connected to Sandip Chadha, of the Chadha Family Trust, per records.\nThe Hyatt House\n810 South Douglas Street\nEl Segundo\nThe Mayer Corporation\u2019s Hyatt House hotel sold after it headed to a\nforeclosure auction\n. The company developed the five-story, 200-key hotel on the University of Southern California\u2019s health sciences campus, landed a $61.5 million loan from Westbrook Partners and then defaulted. The hotel at 810 South Douglas Street in El Segundo sold for $29 million or $105,000 a room. The buyer is not immediately known.\n",

The case could shift control of 5,100 rent-stabilized apartments across 93 buildings.\nWeaver told\nthe New York Times\nthe city was looking to ensure the new owner would pursue repairs and compliance with rent-stabilization laws.\nThe firm placed the buildings into Chapter 11 protection in May, after lender Flagstar Bank\nmoved toward foreclosure\non over $600 million in debt.\nThe portfolio spans Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, making Pinnacle Group one of New York\u2019s largest landlords.\nThe mayor\u2019s office\nsaid the buildings have been the subject of more than 5,000 violations, 14,000 complaints across 83 buildings over the years, and owed money to the city.\nPinnacle has argued in court filings the properties were compromised by a combination of factors, including high leverage,\nrising interest rates\n, increased operating and repair costs, and\nlimits on rent growth\nimposed by New York\u2019s rent-stabilization laws.\nWeaver brushed off the landlord\u2019s claims, telling\nthe Times\nthat the firm has a \u201clong track record \u2026 of egregiously treating renters in their buildings\u201d before the rent laws were passed in 2019.\nThe company \u201crelied on pushing people out of their homes and rent hikes that were untenable when you consider the affordability challenges that our city has,\u201d Weaver told the outlet.\nThe move kicked off Mamdani\u2019s time in office after a campaign that promised a four-year rent freeze for rent-stabilized tenants, a crackdown on bad landlords by revamping the Office to Protect Tenants, and exploring options for the city to take control of distressed properties.\nThe city\u2019s intervention in the Pinnacle bankruptcy would aim to enforce rent-stabilization laws and ensure any buyer is held responsible for fixing long-neglected building conditions, Mamdani said. He framed the case as a test of his administration\u2019s commitment to putting tenant safety and habitability ahead of distressed landlords\u2019 financial restructuring.\nThe move came days after Summit Properties USA made a\n$451 million stalking horse offer\nto acquire the 5,100 distressed units.\nThe bankruptcy paused foreclosure actions while the properties are marketed for sale under court supervision. Any sale would have to be approved by a judge.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It wouldn\u2019t be the end of 2025 without one more office distress scenario playing out in Manhattan.\nThe debt backing Brookfield\u2019s\nOne New York Plaza\nwas shipped to special servicing recently, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The goal of the maneuver is to aid Brookfield in modifying the $835 million CMBS loan backing the 2.5 million-square-foot tower at the intersection of South and Whitehall streets in the Financial District.\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the transfer of the loan, but time is of the essence, as it\u2019s set to mature on Jan. 9. Brookfield has never been delinquent or late to make a payment on the debt.\nWells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BMO Harris Bank provided the loan in 2020, refinancing a $750 million debt issued by Wells Fargo four years earlier. The refinancing included three-year extension options.\nBut cash flow and occupancy both declined at the 50-story tower in recent years. The loan was underwritten with an assumed net cash flow of $84.4 million, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics\u2019 David Putro, but last year\u2019s net cash flow was only $51.2 million.\nOccupancy, meanwhile, has fallen from 100 percent in 2022 to 83 percent as of this September. Office tenants include Morgan Stanley, law firm Fried Frank, and the New York State Office of General Services, while Starbucks and Chipotle are on the retail tenant roster.\nPutro expects Brookfield to pursue an extension on the loan. For its part, Brookfield appears ready to start 2026 with a breakthrough on the CMBS debt.\n\u201cGiven the circumstances and the constructive conversations to date, we are very confident that mutually agreeable extension terms can be achieved quickly with the special servicer,\u201d a spokesperson told the Observer.\nBrookfield can lean on recent success in this realm. In\nOctober alone\n, the landlord scored a $1.25 billion CMBS loan at 5 Manhattan West and a $1.2 billion CMBS loan at a recently redeveloped office tower at 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miki Naftali walks us on white marble floors to an indoor pool at the top of an\nUpper East Side\ncondo tower. He is eager to talk about the ceiling\u2019s heights.\n\u201cI mean, look at the size of the windows here,\u201d Naftali says, pointing to large arched openings that produce unobstructed views, all desired features of the building on East 83rd Street.\nListening to Naftali on the minutia, you momentarily forget he was the guy whose most sweeping deal was buying The Plaza Hotel in 2004 for what was then a record price per room.\nNow, the short and upbeat 63-year-old in clear-framed glasses has paid about a record price per square foot for a residential development site at 800 Fifth Avenue, where he plans to demolish the current structure and put up a 26-story\nRobert A.M. Stern tower\nfor New York\u2019s blue bloods and billionaires.\nIt\u2019s a project that celebrity broker Ryan Serhant believes will be the one the \u201cworld talks about for the next 30 years.\u201d\nIf Serhant is right, Naftali will be etching his name beside the city\u2019s real estate legends, along with Gary Barnett, the Dursts, Rudins, Silversteins and Elghanayans.\nNaftali became a major player in New York real estate seemingly overnight when he bought The Plaza for $675 million while at his former employer El Ad, ruffling feathers of the city\u2019s powerful hotel union and over plans to convert hotel rooms to luxury condos.\nThat splash laid a foundation for Naftali as a dealmaker \u2013 even before final numbers for the Plaza conversion came in. After that, he struck out on his own and did small but successful projects, gaining a reputation as an uptown tastemaker. His buildings are subtle, often with limestone facades, in line with the neighborhood and their residents\u2019 disdain for glass and steel structures favored by New York condo kings. His projects have brought in $1.6 billion worth of financing this year, he said.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThese are not projects that are done in three years.\u201d\nJonah Sonnenborn, Access Industries, on why Naftali\u2019s big swings need patient capital\nEven before 800 Fifth, Naftali had begun doing deals on the level of The Plaza, while also expanding outside Manhattan. He\u2019s bringing 950 residential units to North Brooklyn with a project called the\nWilliamsburg Wharf,\na 67-story tower to Miami and a luxury-branded condo to Fort Lauderdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units, right?\u201d\nThe question is whether Naftali can work on this scale with the laser precision and approach to windows and ceiling heights that have made projects like 200 East 83rd Street so successful. Condo development is always risky, in sway to foreign currency fluctuations, timing and the whims of a few buyers whose complaints about finishes can halt sales.\nNaftali combats the uncertainty with diligence. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do your research, you have no chance to be successful. And even if you do your research, sometimes you can make mistakes,\u201d he said.\nS\ningles and doubles\nNaftali moved to the United States from Israel in the 1980s and studied engineering at the University of Southern California. He got a job at El Ad Properties \u2014 run by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva \u2014 in 2000 and was surprised to be working on straightforward projects out of a nondescript office in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\nBut he picked up bigger and bigger deals until he purchased The Plaza, which overnight made him a major player.\nNaftali had wanted to strike out on his own, but the financial crisis delayed his plans to exit El Ad. In 2011, he opened the Naftali Group.\n\u201cPeople were skeptical, and rightly so,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I had to start with smaller properties and start to grow the business and get the confidence [to] tap into investors in equity funds that I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s first independent deals were a handful of rental buildings in Brooklyn; condos in Gramercy Park, Chelsea and the West Village; and a slew of uptown buildings on either side of Central Park.\n\u201cI tend to shy away from the ultra-tall buildings,\u201d he said.\nHe gained a reputation for luxurious, highly amenitized buildings that catered to Manhattan\u2019s upper crust. While he\u2019s ventured downtown and put up a few glassy structures, he\u2019s mostly known for the quiet limestone look that evokes old money status.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of the Robert Stern school of architecture: limestone facades, classic finishes, not really pushing the envelope but more timeless,\u201d Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s said.\nGeorge added that while Naftali might not have the international recognition of a developer like, say, Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett, he\u2019s definitely got clout with local buyers: \u201cNew Yorkers know his reputation.\u201d\nHe\u2019s done four buildings so far with Robert A.M. Stern\u2019s office (800 Fifth will be the fifth and, possibly one of the last that the famed architect ever worked on \u2014 Stern died last year; see page 56).\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert, who\u2019s headed sales on many of Naftali\u2019s buildings, agreed with the developer\u2019s own assessment that the details matter, even if construction is longer and more expensive.\n\u201cHe bet that people will appreciate it if you do things the right way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so far he\u2019s been both right and lucky.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no shortcuts, no noise, no ego,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trifecta for creating greatness in the development business, it\u2019s hard to find a developer who has one of those themes, let alone all three.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s character sets him apart from other developers. He\u2019s not brash or physically imposing. When he was working in Israel, he said he felt out of place because people were always yelling to get the attention of contractors or subcontractors.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think that he knows everything,\u201d said Glenn Grimaldi, the former head of U.S. commercial real estate at HSBC who now works at Naftali.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with him on a dozen projects over 15 and 20 years,\u201d Stuart Saft, who leads Holland &amp; Knight\u2019s real estate practice group, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him raise his voice, he has authority, he delegates, but he\u2019s not one of these guys when a problem arises he starts screaming at everyone.\u201d\nT\naking Fifth Avenue\nBernard Spitzer developed 800 Fifth Avenue in 1978 on a prime corner at East 61st Street, a stone\u2019s throw away from Grand Army Plaza at the southeast corner of Central Park.\nThe building never really fit the location. Built during the financial struggles of the 1970s, units have low ceilings and basic layouts; the facade never stood up to its grand limestone neighbors.\nAfter Naftali went into contract in March to buy 800 Fifth Avenue from Spitzer Enterprises and the Winter Organization for $810 million, Adam Doneger of Newmark took to LinkedIn to announce that it was the highest price per square foot for land ever. Based on square footage from Property Shark, that would put the price per square foot at about $2,275.\nNaftali acknowledged the high price.\n\u201cWe looked at 800 Fifth and we said, there is only one,\u201d he said. This is the only opportunity anyone will ever have to develop such a prime piece of land overlooking Central Park. \u201cWe think that you pay a big price for a special property. So, time will tell if we are right.\u201d\nThe opportunity is similar to what The Plaza offered in 2004. The condos there drew in buyers like Harry Macklowe, Tommy Hilfiger and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\nBut The Plaza\u2019s conversion had obstacles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now. In the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units.\u201d\nMiki Naftali\nIn February 2007, Russian hedge fund manager Andrei Vavilov went into contract to buy two of the project\u2019s condos for $53.5 million. But he sued El Ad, insisting the apartments were \u201cattic like\u201d due to small windows, low ceilings, obstructed views and ugly drainage grates \u2014 demanding his $10.7 million deposit back and $36 million in damages.\nEl Ad countersued, saying the lawsuit was full of false and defamatory statements, and that Vavilov was just trying to get out of his obligation to buy the apartments.\nThe two sides settled, and Vavilov agreed to buy the smaller of the two units for $11.2 million, which he quickly turned around and sold for a $2.8 million loss.\nA number of owners, in fact, have sold their homes for a loss or just broken even.\nHilfiger bought his two units for $25.5 million and reportedly spent another $20 million, combining them into a penthouse. He put it up for sale \u2014 at one point asking $80 million \u2014 and after 11 years sold it for $31.5 million.\nExperts have said that The Plaza\u2019s best sales happened during pre-sales before people could see their units, and resales were hurt by competition from newer buildings like One Central Park South and 432 Park Avenue.\nV\nenture to Brooklyn\nAs Naftali was selling out new condo towers uptown, he had his eyes on a site across the East River. Naftali was among the many Manhattan luxury builders over the past decade who saw potential in a 3.7-acre site in Williamsburg.\nThey saw the property as the last undeveloped land site in North Brooklyn. It was owned since the 1980s by Abraham and Isaac Rosenberg, for their lumber business. They had their own plans to redevelop the property but were stalled by infighting within the brothers\u2019 Satmar Hasidic community, where two factions, the Aronites and the Zalmanites, were bickering over the best use of the property.\nThe Rosenbergs put the property on the market in 2013. HFZ Capital and Vornado Realty Trust both looked at it, according to The Real Deal articles from the time.\nBut the Rosenbergs discovered that petroleum, pesticides, PCBs and other pollutants had contaminated the site, quashing interest. Three years after that, Isaac died in a drowning accident while swimming off the coast of North Miami Beach.\nNaftali said he became friendly with Abraham at some point that decade. In 2019, it emerged that he\u2019d persuaded Abraham Rosenberg to sell.\n\u201cIt took me about two years to get them to agree to sell it to us,\u201d Naftali previously told\nTRD\n.\nNaftali could make the deal work, unlike developers who\u2019d been scared off. He had the time and money from a big-money equity partner in Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries to go through the cleanup and remediation process. Naftali paid $180 million in 2019 and $100 million in 2020 for the parcels.\n\u201cA lot of [other potential bidders on the site] couldn\u2019t figure out the complexity of a complicated seller counterparty. They also knew that given the amount of buildable square footage that it was going to be a very significant equity requirement,\u201d Jonah Sonnenborn of Access Industries said.\nAccess also wasn\u2019t worried about a complicated deal. It was the firm, along with Witkoff, which ultimately took over the unfinished XI condo project on Manhattan\u2019s High Line when HFZ Capital collapsed.\nAccess and Naftali plan to bring a\nmini-neighborhood\nto Williamsburg.\nWilliamsburg Wharf\nwill span five residential towers with 500 rental units and about 450 condos.\n\u201cIn projects that are larger and more ambitious, it requires more patient capital. It requires permanent capital. These are not projects that are done in three years,\u201d Sonnenborn said.\nCondo sales have already impressed the industry. Williamsburg is a less tested market than the Upper East Side because there are fewer comps. But Naftali is already setting records. An 89-unit condo portion of the project sold 50 percent as of April, making it the city\u2019s top-selling building, according to Marketproof.\nE\nxpansion Mode\nNaftali is not a trend follower.\nSo when his peers started building in Miami Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood in the late 2010s, Naftali stayed put in New York. He missed the wave of wealthy New Yorkers seeking new condos in South Florida during Covid.\nIn 2022, Naftali saw an opportunity in a less glamorous part of Miami. He joined with Cara Real Estate Management and paid $40.5 million for a 1-acre site in a development site dubbed The WorldCenter. The building will be Naftali\u2019s tallest, a 67-story tower with a mix of condos and rental apartments.\nIn Miami, Naftali\u2019s pitch is similar to that of other New York developers: that he can bring New York-level living to Miami.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get the quality in South Florida and in Miami. I mean, we\u2019re sitting in a building that\u2019s not the most expensive building in New York by any stretch of imagination, but the quality here is really good quality,\u201d Naftali said, gesturing around the East 83rd Street condo\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get it in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to get it in South Florida.\u201d\nMiamians roll their eyes at these sorts of claims, and Naftali makes clear there are talented developers in South Florida. Still, fewer condo builders are able to meet buyer expectations, according to Naftali.\n\u201cSpeak with brokers in Miami, and I think the last couple of years, they see it more and more, there is a big difference between some of the projects, between the beautiful renderings at the beginning and the end product,\u201d he said.\nOutside of Miami, Naftali is making an even bolder bet in Fort Lauderdale. The city is seeking to change its reputation as a hub for spring breakers and boat enthusiasts, and Naftali is betting on this potential with a 45-story branded condo.\nHe has also expanded into the debt business, launching a credit arm in 2019 and hiring Grimaldi in 2022. The business focuses on mezzanine loans to other builders.\nMiki\u2019s daughter Danielle is head of marketing sales and design \u2014 she keeps him on his toes, he said. Together, the two review every offer they get.\n\u201cIf, God forbid, I don\u2019t see it for five minutes, Danielle immediately texts me and \u2014 she doesn\u2019t call me dad, she calls me Miki \u2014 \u2018Miki did you see this offer?\u2019\u201d\nT\nhe Cycle\nNaftali\u2019s buildings tend to blend admirably into their surroundings instead of standing out like the towers on Billionaire\u2019s Row or those with flashy architecture.\nAnd the same could be said about the man himself.\nYet 800 Fifth will inevitably draw comparisons to the Zeckendorf\u2019s Stern-designed \u201cLimestone Jesus\u201d at 15 Central Park West, the supertalls on 57th Street and, to some extent, Naftali\u2019s Plaza conversion.\n(Things did not go well for the last developer who sought to do large-scale condo developments uptown: Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital collapsed during Covid, losing historic Beaux Arts buildings such as the Belnord and the Astor to foreclosure. HFZ\u2019s managing principal Nir Meir was indicted in early 2024, accused of masterminding a $86 million fraud scheme in which he allegedly siphoned money out of the project accounts. Meir has pleaded not guilty.)\nSo what gives the developer the confidence he can pull it all off? It\u2019s the small successes, built over time. The attention to detail that hasn\u2019t wavered as projects have grown more ambitious.\n\u201cWe started to build it, and now we\u2019re 14 years after that,\u201d Naftali said of what might seem like a fast rise. \u201cSo this didn\u2019t happen in a day or a month.\u201d\nNaftali also points back to The Plaza. He\u2019s already got the experience, he said.\n\u201cI did it back at El Ad.\u201d",

        "content": "Days after Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic nomination in New York City\u2019s mayoral primary election, he joined NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to answer questions about his platform.\nHe\ntold\nthe show\u2019s host, Kristen Welker, that his primary victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo came down to his campaign\u2019s simple slogans \u2014 \u201cfree buses,\u201d \u201cfreeze the rents\u201d and raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers.\nA less publicized part of the \u201ctax the rich\u201d slogan is updating the city\u2019s\nproperty tax system\n, a notoriously complicated setup that observers of various political leanings find unfair. In campaign proposals, Mamdani said he planned to \u201cshift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and Whiter neighborhoods.\u201d (Mamdani later qualified his comment: \u201cIt\u2019s not driven by race. It\u2019s more an assessment of what neighborhoods are being overtaxed versus undertaxed.\u201d)\nThat pledge expanded the \u201ctax the rich\u201d fear to wealthy, upper-middle class and middle-class homeowners who have enjoyed relatively low rates even as the values of their properties have surged.\n\u201cReading the tea leaves, it feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor,\u201d Compass\u2019 Jason Haber said.\nMamdani reiterated to The Real Dealhis commitment to an across-the-board overhaul the week before he took office.\n\u201cWhen the city\u2019s wealthiest homeowners pay less in property taxes than working families across the five boroughs, it\u2019s clear our property tax system is broken,\u201d Dora Pekec, his spokesperson wrote. \u201cMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will use the full power of the mayor\u2019s office to fix this inequity and ensure that the wealthiest homeowners pay their fair share and working New Yorkers aren\u2019t left carrying the burden.\u201d\nT\nhe politics of it\nFor decades, New York City property tax reform has been a chimera. Most agree it\u2019s necessary, yet no one has managed to make it real.\nOne of the biggest obstacles is that comprehensive reform will require action at both the city and state level. There\u2019s been a lack of political will to be the administration that picks winners and losers.\nWhile the city has purview over how properties are assessed, the main governing law is a state-level statute, which means substantive changes to it would need to be approved by Albany. But in order to make reform a reality, a New York City mayor would likely need to propose and shepherd the updates through the state legislature.\nMayor Bill de Blasio may have gotten closest when he set up an advisory commission to study the issue, but by the time it released recommendations, he was already on his way out. Mayor Eric Adams campaigned on a promise to \u201cimmediately\u201d overhaul the system but took no meaningful steps forward.\nNow the buck passes to Mamdani, who has a few things on his side that his predecessors did not, indicating that his vow to tackle the issue might not be another empty promise. For one, as TRD pointed out in October, he\u2019s made taxing the rich a central part of his platform, so previous mayors\u2019 concerns about upsetting residents with deep pockets likely won\u2019t weigh as heavily on him.\n\u201cIt feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor.\u201d\nCompass\u2019 Jason Haber\nHe\u2019s also stepping into the role after the state\u2019s highest court gave a relevant, long-running lawsuit new legs. The Court of Appeals in 2024 ruled in favor of Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s petition to revive some of its claims against the city, arguing that the current property tax system is \u201cunfair, inequitable and has a discriminatory disparate impact on certain protected classes of New York City property owners.\u201d The group brought the lawsuit against the city and state in 2017, although the appellate court agreed to drop the group\u2019s claims against the state.\nThe lawsuit argues that homeowners in outer boroughs and working class neighborhoods are on the hook for higher tax rates compared to those in the city\u2019s wealthiest areas.\nUnder New York property tax law, condos and co-ops must be assessed in relation to rental buildings, and current city practice is to tie many of those values to rent-stabilized buildings. TENNY\u2019s\ncomplaint\nalso calls for the city to begin taxing some co-ops and condos at the same rate as market-rate rental buildings, a power it argues is under the city\u2019s control.\nWith part of TENNY\u2019s case reopened, the group and the city went back to the state Supreme Court and presented oral arguments in October. They\u2019re awaiting the judge\u2019s decision, which TENNY\u2019s policy director, Martha Stark, said should be handed down by press time.\nBut Stark also said that the appellate judges\u2019 order already paved the way for the city to make changes to its assessment practices without the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.\nFor owners of properties with rent-stabilized units, property tax reform is a welcome prospect. Mamdani\u2019s commitment to freezing rents has so far meant he is open to hearing from these landlords about how to bring down their spending, including on property taxes, so they don\u2019t go broke.\nT\nax burden\nThe prospect of an overhaul is a touchy subject for a certain cohort of New Yorkers, especially owners of co-ops and condos in buildings where sales have been pricey, making them ripe for reform.\nIn court documents, TENNY pointed to several luxury co-ops that had been assessed using rent-stabilized buildings last year, including 998 Fifth Avenue, where Est\u00e9e Lauder chairman William Lauder sold his apartment for nearly $38 million in September.\nUnder the current system\u2019s wonky math, the swanky co-op was compared to a rental building at 945 Fifth Avenue, which includes both market-rate and rent-stabilized units, and then given a lower assessment.\nBut assessing properties in line with market-rate rentals could raise some tax bills to levels unsustainable for many owners, according to Rebecca Poole, membership director for the Council of New York Cooperatives &amp; Condominiums.\n\u201cNo matter what changes are made, there will obviously be winners and losers, and some of the losers shouldn\u2019t be losers,\u201d Poole said. \u201cHopefully, [Mamdani will] see the needs of the middle class homeowners.\u201d\nOne potential tool to make sure \u201closers\u201d don\u2019t lose too badly would be for Mamdani to push for so-called circuit breakers, stop gaps that cap or slow the rise of an assessed value or tax bill if it goes above a certain level, a mechanism he\u2019s already acknowledged he\u2019s considering.\nCo-ops and condo owners also don\u2019t have the same protections as owners of one-to-three-family homes, where a cap bars the city from raising assessed values more than 6 percent each year or more than 20 percent over five years. That cap is especially important for homeowners in neighborhoods where property values have skyrocketed.\nBut the future of that cap could be in question, given Mamdani\u2019s campaign\u2019s stance on shifting the tax burden to richer, Whiter neighborhoods.\nS\nooner or later\nGiven the lawsuit, it\u2019s likely that the city could decide to change how it assesses co-ops and condos as soon as Mamdani takes office, although some say any significant shifts would likely be phased in or out, not immediately instituted. Mamdani, unlike other mayors, has expressed support for TENNY\u2019s lawsuit, signaling he\u2019s more open to going along with its findings than his predecessors. That includes changing assessment ratios, which could lower bills for homeowners in some working class neighborhoods.\nBut more substantive changes to taxation would happen later. If Mamdani does introduce a plan to, for example, change the cap on assessed values for one-to three- family homes, passage and implementation would most likely be years away.\nThat may not be much comfort to the city\u2019s 1 million homeowners. If Mamdani were to adopt the issue as one of his priorities, the back and forth over the fate of property taxes could stall sales or give buyers the upper hand in negotiations for homes likely to be affected by any changes.\n\u201cIf you want to make consumers scared of investing in New York City real estate, the worst thing you can do is play this out over a long time,\u201d appraiser Jonathan Miller said. \u201cUncertainty does no favors to the housing market.\u201d",

        "content": "The seven-story building at the Northeast corner of Walker and Church streets in Tribeca is mostly scaffolding \u2014 for now.\nBut behind the curtain of beams and blue netting, the team at 32 Walker Street has been busy. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff has been quietly shopping five full-floor condos, one of which has already sold after asking close to $10 million.\nZaitzeff, who is heading sales at the project, said his goal is to lock in three buyers before putting up any public listings.\nThe quiet sales process is not a one-off, and is becoming something of a perk offered by the top shelf in New York new development.\nAfter some brokers in 2023\ndeclared the death of the sales gallery, the latest wave of projects came online with little to no public listings, sales offices akin to Harry Potter\u2019s elusive Platform 9 3/4 and scarce Internet presence.\nThis includes several of the city\u2019s \u201c\nIt buildings\n,\u201d like 80 Clarkson, Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s buzzy development, and Aurora Capital Group\u2019s and William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s exclusive boutique at 140 Jane Street, which\nfound a buyer\nfor a penthouse asking $87.5 million.\nWhen The Real Deal reached out to Corcoran\u2019s Tara King-Brown, who is leading sales at 140 Jane along with Corcoran Sunshine, a spokesperson for the project responded, saying that \u201cin the spirit of a quiet new development sales strategy, the team will not be commenting for the story.\u201d\nAt 80 Clarkson, which has eschewed publicity down to filing piecemeal offering plans with the Attorney General\u2019s Office that only revealed a handful of units at a time, the project is well on its way to a $2 billion sellout. The project has not even recorded contracts, an even more extreme level of stealth than competitors. In December,\nTRD\nreported that the building found a buyer willing to pay $129 million for multiple units in the building, which would smash the record for priciest sale downtown.\nRepresentatives for 80 Clarkson did not respond to requests for comment.\nThey really have no need to. The city is bursting at the seams with wealthy buyers who are only getting richer yet aren\u2019t finding enough homes that meet their standards. Quiet sales have also created a hierarchy among brokers, with the select few who gain access because of the caliber of their clients signing contracts at places that the rest of the market hasn\u2019t even heard about.\nThe trend has sparked big market moves even at smaller projects. At a nondescript brick garage in the West Village, four buyers have already signed contracts for homes in what will become a seven-unit boutique condo at 125 Perry Street. One of them bought a unit asking $57.5 million, making it among the most expensive downtown condos.\nCompass\u2019 Stephen Ferrara, one of the agents marketing the building, said that as soon as the sales team started talking about the project, they had a \u201cconsiderable inbound response.\u201d\n\u201cI think people really underestimate how deep the buying pool is,\u201d he said.\nN\nothing to buy\nBefore 2020, it was not unusual to see multiple developments looking to sell more than $500 million \u2014 or in some cases, $1 billion \u2014 in condos.\nDuring those heady days, buildings had to do what they could to break through the noise: splashy spreads in the New York Times, elaborate launch parties and sales offices designed to stick out amid the crowd.\nIn 2012, Gary Barnett\u2019s first Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, One57, had a model of the building\u2019s library with a 24-foot aquarium installed in one wall in its sales office. When HFZ\nlaunched\nits twisting towers along the High Line known as XI in 2018, the project\u2019s sales office had pieces installed by the stage designer for Kanye West and Lady Gaga, including a foyer with a eucalyptus wall and screens with simulated river views.\nSix years later, the game has changed.\nThe project at 80 Clarkson is the first to attempt to do more than $2 billion in sales since the XI, now known as One High Line, and no other approved condo project this year even topped $400 million. The years of shrinking developments have pushed unsold condo units to a 10-year low, according to data shared by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get.\u201d\nPeter Zaitzeff on quiet luxury listings\nThe vanishing competition has given sales teams free rein to handle their processes as they see fit.\n\u201cIt put sellers in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Zaitzeff said of the limited supply of new condos. \u201cI feel like I could sell a C-plus project right now. The lack of inventory gives us a lot more leverage to get a better price and also to sell out a lot more quickly.\u201d\nCorcoran\u2019s Nicole Hechter has sold six buildings for the development firm Grid Group, all with a typical public-facing sales rollout.\nBut for the seventh, a 22-unit boutique building called The Myles, she\u2019s instead taking appointments at the development\u2019s VIP sales gallery. (Corcoran denied The Real Deal access to the office.)\nHechter said the decision was made after seeing the success of other downtown developments and the inbound calls she received before even doing any marketing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just such a lack of inventory in this specific segment of the market that I think we\u2019re getting a tremendous amount of outreach,\u201d she said.\nAn 18-unit boutique at 220 East 9th Street, Ferrara had over 1,000 registrations on the \u201cComing Soon\u201d website before putting up a single listing. \u201cIt caught all of us by surprise,\u201d he said.\nBrokers said that projects with units asking at least $3,000 per foot or $10 million are a typical threshold, where the buyer is already inherently limited by the price.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to a small network of buyers,\u201d Zaitzeff said. In that price bracket, \u201cit\u2019s the 5 percent of agents who do 95 percent of deals.\u201d\nBut beyond being expensive, it seems that projects need a certain something \u2014 a name-brand architect or developer, a superprime location or a truly superior product (something every marketing team says it has).\nEach project has an unreplicable selling point. At 80 Clarkson, buyers have the chance to pick up a piece of a revolutionary phenomenon: a Billionaires\u2019 Row-caliber offering, downtown. The prime units in 125 Perry Street and 140 Jane Street offer incomparable location, and the design from Leroy Street Studio have been major draws. There is only one triangle-shaped Flatiron Building.\nMass marketing can still work for projects with a wider potential pool of buyers, at a certain threshold, the exclusivity becomes another selling point.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get,\u201d Zaitzeff said. \u201cThat\u2019s the perception that we\u2019re getting to the market with a product like this.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not a simple plug-and-play for buildings that cater to the high end of the market.\nAt the Aman Residences at 730 Fifth Avenue, the OKO Group eschewed a public-facing sales office and launched just a handful of its original 22 units in 2017. Developer Vlad Doronin told the Wall Street Journal at the time that the restrained sales strategy spoke to the brand\u2019s exclusivity. But by 2022, the building still had 17 unsold condos, according to an update filed with the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nLuxury housing report author Donna Olshan said the strategy at the time was to market to foreign buyers with brand loyalty \u2014 but she\u2019s skeptical of the whole proposition.\n\u201cIn my over 45 years of experience, the best results are achieved by pricing the property correctly, presenting it in its best light, and immediately marketing to the entire brokerage community to generate maximum activity and create an auction effect,\u201d she writes on her website.\nD\nesperate money\nIt remains to be seen just how restrictive incoming additions to New York\u2019s new development scene can be. But the trend is likely here to stay in the city where the richest have gotten richer in the last few years.\nAfter the first half of 2025, Wall Street firms were on pace for more than $60 billion in profits, after having already seen those numbers jump 90 percent the previous year, to $50 billion. The bonus pool hit record numbers in 2025 as well, and could be on pace to do so again this year, according to a report from the state comptroller\u2019s office.\nThe money flowing through the city has been reflected in a strong luxury market, where contracts for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent in November compared to a year earlier.\nDevelopers are poised with a new playbook to entice future big spenders.\nSome buildings have rolled out pricing on a handful of units, giving developers more flexibility to up the pricing of other units later if the market seems to call for it. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s easier to push pricing if you haven\u2019t already stated what your pricing is going to be,\u201d said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\nIn a market flush with cash buyers and tight inventory, developers can then pitch buyers on getting in early \u2014 before the rest of the market comes flooding in.\nA quiet sales process can also be a way to appeal to those buyers, Kliegerman said, setting off a win-win-win scenario for developers, brokers and buyers.\n\u201cPeople of great means love shiny new items that very few other people can afford, or avail themselves of,\u201d he said. \u201cLike-minded people like to know that they\u2019re special and they like to know that their broker or their name carries enough weight to get them access.\u201d",

        "content": "Since the pandemic, New York City affordable developer Phipps has been giving more and getting less.\nPhipps manages about 10,000 affordable housing units using a comprehensive model, meaning that it provides social services to tenants \u2014 even to those who\nhaven\u2019t paid their rent\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become quite a burden on us for property management and social services to try to get the help needed for our families,\u201d Cathy Pennington of Phipps said.\nDistress in New York\u2019s subsidized affordable housing has been worsening since the 2019 Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act became law and then soaring insurance payments, high utility bills and increasingly expensive maintenance added pressure from the cost side.\nBut buried in the conversation is the fact that the revenue side of the equation has also taken a hit. Tenants, it seems, just don\u2019t\npay their rent\nlike they used to.\nThose in the affordable housing space have their theories about why that is: cultural shifts, economic forces and a system that helps only the renters in the worst shape. One thing they can agree on? It\u2019s not clear that collections will ever naturally recover.\n\u201cAs a lender, we\u2019re treating this as the new normal,\u201d said said Robert Riggs, from Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit lender.\nThe drop in collections and squeezing of revenue might on its own be brutal to New York\u2019s affordable housing. But combined with sharply rising expenses, the prognosis may be fatal.\nS\ntaying put\nAt Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit lender, the average rent collection in its New York affordable projects was once 95 percent. Now, it\u2019s\ncloser to 90\n.\nThe number of projects experiencing more concerning collection rates has also more than tripled. In 2017, just 3 percent of projects had collection rates below 80 percent. Now that figure is 11 percent.\nA shift from 95 to 90 percent may not seem big. But it can mean a loss of about $6,000 per month or $75,000 per year, according to Enterprise. That\u2019s as much as the annual insurance payment on three or four units.\n\u201cThat really does represent a lot of lost income to the properties,\u201d Patrick Boyle of Enterprise said.\nDuring the pandemic, market-rate units had increasing vacancies and lower rents, since tenants moved out of the city and supply overtook demand. But those living in regulated housing were both more likely to see their jobs cut and less likely to move away. They stayed where they were, and those who couldn\u2019t pay just \u2026 didn\u2019t.\nAnother nonprofit lender, Community Preservation Corporation, had collections at projects in its portfolio dip close to 70 percent during that time. Before the pandemic, the lender would underwrite all its projects to 95 percent collections, and it expected an even higher rate.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge. Which is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nJohn Crotty, founding member at Workforce Housing Group\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, it was just a truism in the industry that people with below-market rents paid their rent,\u201d Riggs said.\nSince then, CPC has had to revise its strategy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t underwrite to 95 percent collections anymore,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cThere\u2019s no track record of that happening in the last 5 years.\u201d\nThe collections numbers still hover at about 92 percent.\nAffordable housing in New York is developed by both nonprofit and for-profit operators, who agree to certain conditions to access city and state funding and financing. One is pegging maximum rent increases to levels set by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board. A freeze on those increases, the marquee campaign promise of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, would stymie revenue even further.\nIt\u2019s not totally clear to what extent the trend in New York\u2019s affordable housing mirrors collection declines in the market-rate and national housing markets. Data is difficult to come by, especially pre-pandemic data. The American Apartment Owners Association says that traffic to its collections agency has stabilized since the pandemic, and the National Multifamily Housing Council has stopped monitoring national rent collections.\nThose who study these numbers say that they believe national collections in market-rate housing are just slightly below where they were pre-pandemic, but that\u2019s based more on educated hunches than on hard numbers.\n\u201cEverything within our data suggests that even when renters do fall behind, they show a high priority to catch back up,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Kane of Chandan Economics, which monitors rental performance, said.\nBoyle, at Enterprise, said that he believes the issue is most acute in the affordable space, but not just in the city. About one-quarter of the projects in the nonprofit\u2019s data are outside the five boroughs.\nO\nut on the edge\nAmong borrowers in CPC\u2019s portfolio, collections are uneven across properties, Riggs said. But the lender has so far failed to find a pattern. Did the pandemic and the eviction moratorium change how tenants think about and prioritize rent? Are tenants who don\u2019t pay making their neighbors wonder why they don\u2019t do the same?\n\u201cSometimes we see an owner with similar buildings and the same management company in the same neighborhood and they have completely different collections,\u201d Riggs said.\nBut at the base of the issue, some in the affordable space say, is a tight financial reality.\n\u201cIf you have no money and there\u2019s three choices you have, and one of them is food, then there\u2019s the other two,\u201d John Crotty, a founding member at Workforce Housing Group and former city official, said. \u201cPeople are broke, they\u2019re hurting.\u201d\nThose in lower-cost housing are more likely to find themselves in a pinch.\n\u201cEveryone is concerned with affordability,\u201d Oksana Mironova, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society, said. \u201cLower-income people are the ones who are always hit.\u201d\nAt the same time, some city policies incentivize tenants to fall deeper into arrears. Housing court takes months, keeping renters in units they can\u2019t pay for without help.\nSometimes it takes being nearly evicted for a tenant to qualify for city resources.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to prevent eviction, but unfortunately, after a period of time and as the arrears grow, we do have to turn to the courts to help us,\u201d Pennington of Phipps said. \u201cAnd sometimes in court, they finally get the help they need.\u201d\nFor example, the city\u2019s \u201cone shot\u201d deal helps the neediest New Yorkers get out of arrears with a lump sum payment. But prioritizing only those in severe distress, some say, makes renters go through greater deprivation in the hopes of getting help.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cWhich is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nOther rental assistance programs, such as the CityFHEPS voucher program, can end quickly, leaving a tenant in a unit they can\u2019t afford, Pennington said.\nThe highest levels of rent nonpayment are likely in metropolitan areas where rents have risen steeply since the pandemic and salaries have not kept up, according to Alexandra Alvarado of the American Apartment Owners Association. The median rent for a new lease in Manhattan has risen 13 percent in the past year, according to a December report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\n\u201cThe majority of people are just struggling financially,\u201d Alvarado said of those who aren\u2019t paying nationally. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily a choice.\u201d\nP\nush and pull\nThose in the affordable and nonprofit space are keen to discuss carrots, not sticks. They focus on easing access to city resources.\nThe New York Housing Conference, which advocates for affordable housing, has proposed a separate housing court specifically for those in subsidized units. Staff there could assist with accessing city one-shot deals and other rental assistance programs. This could, at least in theory, save the city money by helping tenants when they have less in arrears.\n\u201cThe tenant gets so far in the hole in accumulated arrears that they can\u2019t dig their way out,\u201d Rachel Fee, the group\u2019s executive director, said.\nBut speeding up housing court could also ease evictions.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some hope \u2014 and this is terrible to say \u2014 that as evictions start to happen at a faster rate, that behavior will change,\u201d said Riggs.\nBut in the meantime, they say, something has to give. Piling on expenses without more revenue is pushing affordable housing toward a cliff.\n\u201cThe lack of cash coming in from failure to pay rent, and the court system not changing that in any timely fashion, indeed making it longer, is fatal,\u201d Crotty said via email. \u201cBuilding owners can\u2019t withstand it.",

        "content": "Sales slow, costs mount and investors grumble and place blame on e-commerce, tariffs or a pandemic:\nAnother\nretail\nchain\nis filing for bankruptcy. While creditors cross their fingers and lawyers go to court, landlords brace for missed payments.\nThis is when Ivan Friedman\u2019s phone rings.\n\u201cIn my business, bad is good,\u201d he said.\nOn the line, often, are the private equity firms and ownership groups who want to swoop in and buy low. To rescue a bankrupt chain, the companies need someone to renegotiate rents on hundreds of stores. It\u2019s unpleasant but critical grunt work, and many believe Friedman does it best.\nPlenty of mall mainstays have hit bottom during the four decades of his career. Friedman\u2019s company, Manhattan-based RCS Real Estate Advisors, was the go-between for retailers and their landlords for many of them. Friedman\u2019s arrangements can enable their survival. When\nClaire\u2019s\n, facing a $496 million loan it couldn\u2019t afford, filed for Chapter 11 last summer, the buyer turned to Friedman to\nfix its leases\nbefore closing on the sale. During Simon Property Group and Brookfield Corporation\u2019s purchase of Express out of bankruptcy in 2024, RCS saved the brand nearly $100 million on real estate obligations, court records show.\nEven those that have stayed out of bankruptcy, like Vans, Gap, Cole Hahn and Hollister, have used RCS\u2019 services to pay less for spaces or strategize expansions.\nThe typical story played out one Friday night a few years ago. Friedman was en route to his beach house when a call came in from an unfamiliar number. It was the head of a private equity firm that had recently purchased a national retailer out of bankruptcy.\n\u201cWe got a problem,\u201d the executive said.\nThe retailer and one of its landlords, a major shopping mall owner, could not agree on a reduced rent, putting nearly 300 of its more than 1,200 stores, and their revenue, at risk. As the court deadline approached and negotiations failed to advance, the executive started to sweat.\nFriedman worked out the numbers. If he could reduce the rent on that group of stores to 40 percent of the original, would the firm take that deal?\nAbsolutely, the executive said.\nAt the house, Friedman called the landlord. Only a handful of owners own most of the country\u2019s\nmalls\n, so a call from Friedman doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019re about to accept less money at one location but that they may have to reduce the rent across several properties. In this case, if the landlord agreed, Friedman told him, the firm would accept all of the leases by the next day. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d Friedman said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the guys who play the Bond villain, and he plays the Bond villain better than anybody,\u201d another major mall landlord who sits opposite Friedman in negotiations like this told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cNot a lot of people want to do this job because they want to be liked.\u201d\n\u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nIvan Friedman\nThe next morning, the landlord called Friedman to accept the terms. The good news and the speed of its delivery stunned the private equity executive.\nFor the last two decades, about half of Friedman\u2019s career, the phones have been ringing in a world where the realities of retail are rapidly changing. The last few years have been particularly jarring. Foot traffic has dwindled at mid- and lower-tier malls, with 10 and 18-percent drops, respectively, compared to 2019, according to Placer.ai, which tracks consumer movement. Even one-time high-performing malls have fallen on hard times, landing in\nforeclosure\nand wiping out bondholders.\nThe king of the discounted mall lease isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of years, and a lot of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either get old and you benefit from the years, or you get old and die. And I ain\u2019t dying.\u201d\nH\nolding the line\nFriedman follows the retail industry like a sports team, so Claire\u2019s demise was no surprise. \u201cClaire\u2019s had been a mess for 10 years,\u201d he said. As Maryland-based private equity firm Ames Watson began circling the 64-year-old retailer, Friedman expected a call from co-founder Lawrence Berger, whom he\u2019s known for 15 years. Ames Watson\u2019s purchase would require saving several million dollars per year on rent across the U.S. portfolio.\nFriedman determined Ames Watson needed to keep at least 675 of Claire\u2019s roughly 1,300 U.S. locations for the deal to pencil. Then, Friedman swung into action. \u201cOnce we lock up a deal, Ivan has to go perform,\u201d Berger said.\nOver the next six weeks, Friedman and his team of 17 examined each individual Claire\u2019s lease, dialed the landlords and haggled.\nFriedman doesn\u2019t hire accomplished, successful negotiators. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. Instead, he brings on employees he can tell are \u201canxious for success, for money, to learn, and to become established.\u201d Negotiation is something you teach, Friedman said, often through fire.\n\u201cYou give someone 20 landlords and see how long it takes them to cry,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAnd when they come back, because they were made to cry, they start asking the right questions. They start understanding that all landlords have the same stories of why what you\u2019re asking is too expensive and why they can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nFor the leases held by REITs such as Simon Property Group, Brookfield and Macerich, Friedman makes personal calls to top executives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of \u2018Hey guy, here are the numbers, here is what I\u2019m going to need, and this is why I\u2019m going to need it, you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nFriedman is adamant that the keys to his success are relatively banal: age, experience and relationships. Yet, he and his team have crafted creative ways to convince landlords to lower rents.\nSince Covid, percentage agreements, in which the landlord agrees to accept a lower base rent in exchange for a percentage of the store\u2019s sales revenue, have become more popular in shopping mall leases. The breakpoint percentage clause outlines the shape of this agreement, and sets the revenue threshold a store must reach before cutting the landlord in. For a retailer that spends $120,000 on annual rent, the landlord might set a breakpoint rate of 5 percent. This means that after $2.4 million in sales ($120,000 divided by 0.05), the landlord begins earning 5 percent of the store\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cI throw that out,\u201d Friedman said.\nIn that example, Friedman would instead aim to get the gross rent down to about 12 percent of total sales and then cut the landlord in on 12 percent of the sales revenue growth moving forward. These post-bankruptcy leases are often short-term, aimed at giving the retailer a chance to reset and begin growing the business again.\n\u201cI\u2019m selling them on the idea of keeping a long-term business that has value,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want 18 to 20 percent of sales for rent, I can\u2019t grow. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nMany in the industry respect his touch and gamesmanship. Still, Friedman knows his reputation: People have called him an animal, the enemy and the devil.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s probably because they lost the last transaction,\u201d the mall exec countered. In their small world, you\u2019re likely to\u00a0 encounter Friedman more than once, which helps the sides stay civil.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any landlord gets excited to hear from Ivan, but the reality is that it has to be done and he\u2019s a pretty rational person,\u201d Berger said.\nThis playbook worked for Claire\u2019s. When Ames Watson closed on its purchase in October, Friedman and RCS had successfully renegotiated more than 900 leases at heavy discounts.\nB\norn this way\nFriedman, now 84, is the child of Russian immigrants who came to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. The family lived above his father\u2019s shop, a women\u2019s clothing store in East New York, where Friedman began sweeping floors at age 5.\nAbout 1960, Friedman, not yet 20, opened his own ladies\u2019 clothing shop. An Army reservist, Friedman was briefly pulled back into active duty during the Cuban missile crisis. When he returned to New York, he expanded his business to \u201cfive or six stores,\u201d he said. Then, picking up the pace, he bought a department store chain with 150 locations in the late 1970s.\n\u201cHaving grown up in retail, there was nothing else for me to do besides the natural progression of opening up my own stores,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cImmigrant families are very much always focused on one thing, and don\u2019t always have the breadth of opening up to other possibilities.\u201d\nYet, he increasingly found the business exhausting, and as the 1980s approached, Friedman began looking for a way out.\u00a0 He found it in real estate.\nFriedman discovered he could make more money from selling off his brick-and-mortar leases than what the stores would earn over the next decade. \u201cThat business was worth more dead than alive,\u201d he said.\nFriedman didn\u2019t yet have a plan for his next chapter when General Electric Capital called later that year. An executive asked him to go down to Oklahoma on a semi-clandestine mission to gather information on the CEO of a retailer the company had invested in. Using his retail expertise, Friedman would operate as a \u201creal estate consultant,\u201d on behalf of General Electric.\n\u201cThen they said, \u2018While you\u2019re down there, maybe you can call some landlords and see if you could get some rent relief or something,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI said, hmm, that could be a business. And it was.\u201d\nWord got around that Friedman was a worthy advisor, and he soon started hearing from more retail executives with real estate problems. He then founded RCS Real Estate Advisors.\n\u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\nanonymous mall executive\nUpon reflection, Friedman doesn\u2019t see too many other ways it all could have gone. He avoids grand conclusions about life or work. \u201cBusiness is business, life is life\u201d is a common Friedman-ism.\nIn life, he said he mostly avoids malls, except \u201cwhen my wife asks me to shop.\u201d\nBut business was the order of the day on a recent Thursday afternoon as he arrived at the entrance of Simon Property Group\u2019s Jersey Gardens Outlet Mall in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Friedman stepped out from the backseat of a black Lincoln Town Car and adjusted his Paul Stuart overcoat as he scanned the property. It\u2019s the state\u2019s largest indoor outlet mall, and Friedman\u2019s fingerprints are all over it. Of the 200 brands here, he\u2019s negotiated for 26 of them.\nFrom his coat pocket he took out a schematic of the mall\u2019s retail spaces, printed on two sheets of paper stapled together. Red lines mark the spaces of the retailers he has represented.\n\u201cYou judge a mall by how much business it does per square foot,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cShitty malls do $200 to 300 per [square foot].\u201d\nThis one does $930, roughly $1.2 billion per year, making it \u201cone of the better-performing malls, especially for an outlet,\u201d he said.\nInside, Friedman could barely walk 20 feet without pointing out former or current clients, Gap and Old Navy, Brooks Brothers, Ann Taylor Loft, True Religion and Vans. Eventually, he made it to Claire\u2019s.\n\u201cMy Claire\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nFriedman hesitates to talk specifics about his partners, deals, nemeses or numbers. But standing among his stores, he opened up, the storefronts surfacing war stories from the negotiation room. Friedman described Covid as \u201ca godsend\u201d for his company. His phone barely stopped ringing with brands desperate to renegotiate their leases. Yet, few contracts had contingencies for global pandemics, which meant many retailers found themselves stuck in closed malls.\n\u201cI called up David Simon and said, \u2018Don\u2019t give me this force majeure stuff,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\nInstead of going to court, he suggested an informal plan: \u201cFor the companies that aren\u2019t in trouble, how about we pay a month of rent, and then you pay a month. We share the pain.\u201d\nSimon eventually agreed.\nTouring the mall, Friedman seemed to sense that at least some of the brands he hadn\u2019t worked with yet would eventually call.\n\u201cThere will always be a supply of weaker companies,\u201d Friedman said \u2014 future customers.\nU\npper hand?\nMarket conditions used to give Friedman the clear advantage in lease negotiations. From the 1980s into the early 2000s, malls boomed, and landlords had to compete to retain tenants. Friedman could more easily predict the answer to the question: \u201cHey, do you want some rent or no rent?\u201d\nBut these are different times, as malls continue to close while demand for retail space climbs.\n\u201cThis has been described as probably the best two-year period of retail demand in the last decade,\u201d Vince Tibone, head of industrial and mall research at financial services firm Green Street, said. However, in this inverse reality where landlords have the power, quality is key.\nIn Class A malls \u2014 those that make more than $630 per square foot in revenue \u2014 occupancy has hovered near 95 percent in recent years. A November Green Street report showed Tanger\u2019s third-quarter occupancy rate at 98 percent; Simon Property Group\u2019s 96 percent occupancy is within a percentage point of its all-time high. For these landlords, a vacancy might be a chance to bring in a growing chain, like an Alo, Sephora or Everlane.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life,\u201d the mall exec said. \u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\n\u201cWe can say, \u2018Okay, give me my five best stores back, you can keep the five worst, and we make deals,\u2019\u201d the exec added. \u201cIf you want to give me 100,000 square feet back of Claire\u2019s, I can absorb that without being killed now, especially when I know I can re-lease it for higher.\u201d\nThe landlord said Friedman has an advantage over the mid- and lower-tier mom-and-pop mall owners who can\u2019t risk the expense of a vacancy. Between 2017 and 2022, an average of 40 malls per year shut down, and experts believe that trend is likely to continue among the weaker malls in the U.S.\nYet demand at the high end can mask underlying weakness. In October, a distressed debt fund\nseized\ncontrol of The Palisades Center in West Nyack, one of the largest malls in the country, leaving CMBS bondholders with a $231 million loss. It was only the second time AAA CMBS bondholders suffered losses since the financial crisis, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, the 1.5 million-square-foot San Francisco Centre, another Class A mall, is over 90 percent vacant, and AAA CMBS bondholders could also take losses on at least four other deals, according to a Barclays\u2019 report.\nRetail\u2019s been declared dead before, but Friedman believes that the industry will outlast turbulence as it always has, from department store consolidation in the 1990s, the Great Recession of 2008, the so-called retail apocalypse brought on by e-commerce in the mid 2010s and the 2020 pandemic.\nPeople, on the other hand, don\u2019t last forever. Friedman counts himself among a respected group of peers still working. He half jokingly compares himself to Mick Jagger and admires Vornado CEO Steven Roth, also 84. \u201cHe comes to work every single day.\u201d (He disagrees with Roth\u2019s decision to let his hair go gray. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d) Although he has a succession plan in place, Friedman has no plan to step away.\n\u201cIf I could move a coffin into my office so that I could die at my desk and they just wheel it over and drop me in, that would be fine,\u201d Friedman said.",

        "content": "Nick P\u00e9rez has a clear view of South Florida\u2019s condo market, especially the ultra-high-end segment. From September to early December of 2025, his family\u2019s Related Group sold $450 million worth of condos, with more to come. Between October 2025 and this coming March, Related and its partners are completing condo projects totaling 1,500 units, including the Crosby at Miami Worldcenter and Nomad Residences Wynwood.\nP\u00e9rez is president of the condo division at Related, where he and his brother, CEO\nJon Paul P\u00e9rez\n, have been taking on more leadership, though the Miami-based firm is still led by Nick\u2019s father, billionaire developer Jorge P\u00e9rez.\n\u201cThe strength is definitely in the ultra-luxury product,\u201d Nick P\u00e9rez said in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWith partners, the firm is under construction at\nSix Fisher Island\nResidences, where buyers are paying an average price per foot of $4,000, high for preconstruction.\nBut he\u2019s also noticed that at cheaper, short-term-rental-friendly projects, developers are all fighting for the same buyer.\n\u201cTake a step down into the more affordable range, or once you\u2019re down in the range of $1,000 to $1,400 per square foot, that market is very saturated,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. That range includes Viceroy Residences, where\nTRD\nconducted this interview.\nSome developers are overleveraged and may fail, P\u00e9rez observed. But Related is pushing ahead with projects from Miami to West Palm Beach to Tampa, and holding onto a handful of sites with big plans, including one rumored to be a Ritz-Carlton-branded high-rise development in North Bay Village with Harry Macklowe\u2019s firm.\nIt\u2019s not 2008, when Related had to hand the keys over to its lenders on four condo projects.\nThe summer was slow, but an autumn boom emerged, thanks mostly to sales at three luxury waterfront condo projects: $70 million presold at Rivage Bal Harbour, which Related is co-developing with Two Roads Development; $80 million at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach (with BH Group); and $100 million presold at the St. Regis Residences Miami, with partner Integra Investments.\nBaccarat Residences, a 75-story, 355-unit tower that\u2019s under construction in Miami\u2019s Brickell in the same complex as Viceroy, has fewer than 10 units left, P\u00e9rez said, though sales launched in 2021.\nHere\u2019s what else Nick had to say about the market and the firm\u2019s pipeline.\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nTell me about 2025.\nIt was kind of a roller-coaster year. We had a new U.S. president, which the industry was super excited about. There was certainty on where we were going. Then Liberation Day came and the stock market took a tank. That caused a ton of\nuncertainty\n, not only in the real estate market, but in investment decisions across private equity, across data, every industry. Because uncertainty kills all investments. You don\u2019t know how to invest without knowing you know what your cost of goods is going to be. Are you going to hire? Are you going to fire? This summer was not a great summer, but come Sept. 1 there was some calm in the market. Interest rates have gone down, which has helped but still not enough.\nThere\u2019s still a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for further rate cuts.\nIs the Mamdani effect [of New Yorkers migrating to Southern Florida] overhyped?\nThis happens every time. Trump gets elected, some people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or Biden got elected, people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or when Mamdani got elected, New York\u2019s \u201cgone forever.\u201d Developers are talking with Mamdani. There\u2019s always a little bit of\noverhype\nbecause of, again, the uncertainty.\nYes, there\u2019s been more interest, more calls, more web leads, more form fills. But it hasn\u2019t been the rush that everyone has [predicted].\nThere is so much competition in lower price points. How do you stand out?\nBetween Miami-Dade and Broward, 144 projects have been announced. The vast majority are [like the Viceroy Residences]. But they don\u2019t have this location that we have [riverfront in Brickell], but it\u2019s that type of unit, size and price point.\nMiami has become extremely expensive. We\u2019re selling Icon Beach right now at $1,200, $1,300 [per square] foot in Hollywood. Six years ago, we sold out Hyde Beach House at $670 a foot. Prices have grown astronomically. Wages have not followed, and especially South American wages; and the dollar is strong. So, the purchasing power of South Americans has not kept up with the price appreciation that\u2019s happened in the market.\nAre you holding back on launching projects?\nWe are preparing, going through the design process, and getting all of our marketing material ready on a lot of jobs. Our Aventura multifamily site, we\u2019re going through the design process to get all the materials ready.\nNorth Bay Village\n, we cleared the site, we are going through the design process and getting through the marketing materials. That takes eight to 10 months.\nBird Road, which we bought with 13th Floor Investments, is another one, we think with product type, location, price entry point, young families. That one we\u2019re branding in a unique way, which we\u2019ll get to later next year. But that is going to have an entry point, about $1,200, $1,300 a [square] foot. It\u2019s right by the metro, in between Coconut Grove and Coral Gables.\nWe are getting all those ready \u2014 and watching the market.\nAre you expecting a price correction?\nPrice increases will be difficult. I don\u2019t think there will be a decrease. Immigration is starting to take effect on some labor issues. We haven\u2019t seen it but we\u2019re hearing labor is hard to come by. Construction costs, we haven\u2019t seen them spike a lot but it\u2019s starting to trickle in as we\u2019re pricing new jobs. There\u2019s no way someone can build cheaper in two years than they can today. The only thing that can adjust is owners\u2019 expectations of the value of the land. That\u2019s really hard to change also. You will see some people get in trouble for overpaying and realize how expensive it is to build.\nAre you offering incentives to sell condos?\nYes, they\u2019re definitely in the market. A lot of those are not very wide blasted. Once word gets out, then everyone else starts doing it.\nAre you looking at picking up stalled project sites?\nNot actively. We have enough. Maybe those buyers, if their projects don\u2019t come through, they come to our projects.\nI won\u2019t tell you where but we gobbled up a bunch of units in a condo to create a blocking position in case someone comes in. We\u2019re planting seeds for the next big run.\nNewly elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins campaigned on increasing affordable housing, restoring trust to City Hall and improving permitting issues. What policies or incentives would help create more affordable housing?\nAffordability is the biggest issue. People are spending over 50 percent of their income on rent, when the norm used to be 30 percent. It\u2019s not going to change overnight, but that has to change. We have the right mayor that was elected by the city of Miami to try.\nMayor Higgins was instrumental within the county in promoting affordable housing. She was probably one of our biggest cheerleaders. The county has massive amounts of land, so they\u2019re able to do affordable housing by executing 99-year ground leases to the developer. The city of Miami doesn\u2019t have that much land, so I don\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019s going to try to do.",

        "content": "I\nn California, there\u2019s Irvine Company, owned by the country\u2019s richest developer, and there\u2019s everyone else.\nBut calling FivePoint Holdings an also-ran doesn\u2019t convey the importance of what the land developer has done \u2014 or could do \u2014 in the state. The coastal California master-planned communities developer, connected to deep-pocketed Lennar, has delivered thousands of homes in a state that is underbuilt by millions, and managed to turn a profit.\nNew megadevelopments are rare in sought-after parts of the Golden State, but the company has three: one in Orange County, one in Los Angeles County and a third in San Francisco, with 12,500 homesites completed so far. All together, they plan to deliver 40,000 homes and 23 million square feet of commercial space. FivePoint began to develop the first two, Great Park Neighborhoods and Valencia, under singularly difficult conditions, including lender bankruptcies, municipal bait-and-switches, community resistance and \u2014 this being California \u2014 battles over native fish and carbon emissions.\nNonetheless, the developer has recently sold sites at Great Park, the Orange County community, for about\n$10 million an acre\n, much more than their pre-2020 price.\nBut if Great Park and Valencia, the L.A. community, seemed feasible only to the kind of developer who could pull off the hardest stuff, the difficulty of developing FivePoint\u2019s San Francisco project, called Candlestick and The San Francisco Shipyard, veered toward impossible.\nIn 1999, San Francisco named Lennar the master developer of the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, which the Navy had used to decontaminate ships after nuclear tests. A decade earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the area a Superfund site, and the Navy hired a firm called Tetra Tech to investigate, test and remediate much of the land in advance of handing it over to the developer. In the meantime, two things happened: In 2006, Lennar won development rights to the nearby Candlestick, once home to the San Francisco 49ers and Giants, and in 2009, Lennar spun out FivePoint to make the latter a focused land developer (or perhaps to satisfy a promising executive who may have wanted his own domain). Little went as planned. In 2014, it came out that Tetra Tech employees had falsified soil samples, swapping in clean dirt for contaminated in tests. Criminal and civil lawsuits dogged the remediator, and the development site, for years. Several, including one with FivePoint, are still winding their way through the courts. Two Tetra Tech employees were sentenced to federal prison in 2018 after pleading guilty.\nThe saga seemed to change FivePoint, which in 2022 installed a tight-lipped, Irvine Company-trained operator named Daniel Hedigan in place of its original chief executive, Emile Haddad, known industry-wide as a creative visionary not overly concerned with stock prices. The macro environment was changing too. Interest rates shot up, making financing more difficult, even as California\u2019s politicians finally came around to the idea that the state had to build more places to live. Per a state requirement, San Francisco is supposed to add 82,000 new homes by 2031. Together, FivePoint\u2019s Candlestick and Shipyard \u2014 neighboring peninsulas jutting out into the San Francisco Bay \u2014 could deliver 12,000, or 15 percent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really.\u201d\na Shipyard resident, where about 450 of a planned 12,000 homes have been built\nIn late 2024 came a sign that development could proceed.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors granted approvals to transfer approximately 2 million square feet of the Shipyard\u2019s entitlements to Candlestick for research and development and office space. While this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of the Shipyard or its soil, it does mean that FivePoint will be able to develop land for\na little more than half the housing\nit originally planned \u2014 about 7,000 homes \u2014 if it can find the funding after all this time.\nThe San Francisco project could cost \u201chundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, to develop,\u201d according to Walker &amp; Dunlop analyst Alan Ratner. And that\u2019s if the company can nab a partner at attractive terms.\nIf not, \u201cthe asset becomes worthless,\u201d Ratner said.\nFivePoint declined to make Hedigan or Haddad available for an interview. Lennar declined to participate.\nD\none it before\nGreat Park Neighborhoods, in Irvine, is among the best master-planned communities in the country, according to John Burns, who runs a research and consulting firm. Homes are modern and very uniform; residents report on Reddit that kids run around and families like the amenities, though some say landscaping is more sterile than in other Irvine developments. Either way, there are few other choices for buyers who want new builds. Valencia, in the Santa Clarita Valley, is the kind of place that began to do well during the pandemic as millennials simultaneously had kids and secured hybrid jobs that made the hourlong commute down the 5 freeway to L.A. proper tolerable. Valencia sells them angular townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes with model names like \u201cWren\u201d and \u201cSkylar\u201d for upwards of $800,000.\nGreat Park came into being after Lennar won an auction to buy the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Irvine in 2005,\npaying\n$650 million for the ex-military base. In 2008, its lender, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, kicking off the global financial crisis. Development stalled until FivePoint, post-Lennar spin-off, landed\nfresh financing\nthree years later.\nHere, too, there was contamination from the military, but after a Navy cleanup, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the majority of El Toro off the Superfund site list in 2014.\nThere were other problems. When Lennar purchased the land, it had transferred more than 1,000 acres to the city of Irvine and paid hundreds of millions of dollars in development fees. The idea was that the city would build a world-class park, and the development\u2019s homes and businesses would surround it. But the city\nspent\nmost of the $200 million Lennar paid without making much progress. By the time FivePoint took over the project, it had to figure out how to extend a private-public partnership and wrangle an agreement allowing the company to develop a scaled-back park and to double the number of homes planned.\nFivePoint made its first land sales that year, but a\nbattle\nover a cemetery tempered the victory. The city promised a veterans cemetery in the park, but Haddad, concerned about how a cemetery would be perceived by million-dollar buyers, proposed another location. The back and forth went on for a decade.\nBut development continued, and 9,400 homesites have now been sold to builders, including Lennar, as of September 2025. The homebuilders have sold 7,300 homes, and FivePoint is eyeing entitlements for more sites.\nThe road to Valencia wasn\u2019t any easier. A 2015 California Supreme Court decision required an amended analysis of the development\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and measures to protect the unarmored threespine stickleback fish, following uproar from environmental groups. In 2016, FivePoint filed an updated environmental review for the Santa Clarita Valley development, then called Newhall Ranch, which deemed the development net zero \u2014 no emissions ever. A year later, the developer reached a settlement to provide $25 million for conservation efforts and received reapprovals from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Builders have picked up about 3,100 homesites and sold nearly 1,800 to buyers as of the third quarter of 2025, according to quarterly filings.\nBut land sales have slowed while builders wait for buyers to be able to afford new homes and interest rates to ease. FivePoint has not sold any land at Valencia in about a year but said in its most recent quarterly report that it is \u201cworking with builders on two residential land sales that are expected to close in 2026.\u201d\nT\nhe missing element\nFifteen years ago, Newsom, then mayor of San Francisco, wearing a suit and signature blue tie, his hair only beginning to grey, held a press conference.\nHe signed 12 pieces of legislation to greenlight the second phase of what he said would be the largest redevelopment project in San Francisco\u2019s history \u2014 the future Shipyard and Candlestick.\nHe pitched the project well enough for at least one member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Sophie Maxwell, to actually thank the private homebuilder at the press conference.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s the boogeyman,\u201d Maxwell said, \u201cbut I still want to thank Lennar for hanging in there with us.\u201d\nNewsom continued to beat the housing drum, and when he campaigned for governor in 2017, he promised to shepherd the addition of 3.5 million homes.\nIt made sense that Lennar and FivePoint, firms able to turn less-than-desirable land into thousands of homes, would be allies of politicians with even a slightly YIMBY bent. That\u2019s especially true in San Francisco, which is now so short of housing goals that the state could invoke a punishment called builder\u2019s remedy.\nInstead of its mandated 82,000 new units by 2031, the city\u2019s Family Zoning Plan is likely to deliver only half that, and in twice the time, according to a recent report by local economist Ted Egan. A group called the California Housing Defense Fund, which sues municipalities over noncompliant zoning, has already threatened legal action against the City of San Francisco, which could force the issue.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy.\u201d\nStuart Miller, Lennar CEO, on the FivePoint spin-off\nIf triggered, builder\u2019s remedy would automatically allow some development proposals, even if they surpass local height limits or threaten rent-controlled units, essentially neutering local zoning power.\nMeanwhile, Newsom\u2019s second and final term is near an end, and there are nowhere near 3.5 million new places to live. (In 2022, running for reelection, he walked the number back to 2.5 million by 2030.) Just 650,000 new homes were permitted in the state between 2019, when he took office, and 2023, according to the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s late 2024\nreporting\n.\nIn the same period, many developers and investors left rather than take on the feat that is building in California. That includes the country\u2019s fourth-largest apartment developer, Wood Partners, which in 2024 announced it was no longer pursuing new development projects in the state.\nA\nnew leader\nBut FivePoint pushes on in California, thanks to two sharply different personalities who have led the way through the development gauntlet.\nThe first was Emile Haddad, who came to the United States from Lebanon at age 27, following the civil war.\nThe war \u201cleft a scar \u2014 a scar of seeing communities being torn apart, families torn apart, friends torn apart,\u201d he once told a group of University of Southern California students. \u201cI started realizing that really what I have is a passion for building communities.\u201d\nHe started at Lennar in 1996.\nHaddad looked to Lennar CEO and executive chairman Stuart Miller as a mentor, a person familiar with the company said. Miller, who is also executive chairman at FivePoint, took a chance on Haddad, who rose through the ranks to chief investment officer. The two had an almost father-son relationship, though they sometimes clashed, the source said.\nAt $14, FivePoint\u2019s opening share price was below the expected range. On the first day of trading, Lennar purchased $100 million worth of shares. Lennar still owns a 40 percent share in its spin-off.\nBut FivePoint wasn\u2019t trying to be a national leader like Lennar, and Haddad\u2019s calling appeared to be on the ground in California, building alliances, wooing the press and bolstering his defenses against naysayers. Lennar\u2019s Miller may have seen that as an opportunity.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy,\u201d Miller said the day of the IPO.\nAnd Haddad was all in from the start. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d he said when Lennar outbid others on what would become Great Park. In 2011, he got financing for the stalled development in a tight lending environment. \u201cIt is very unusual in today\u2019s world to be talking about a project of this magnitude as one that is moving forward,\u201d Haddad said at a press conference then. He innovated on marketing, selling a lifestyle \u201cbefore it was a thing,\u201d a source familiar with the firm said.\nAfter the city of Irvine spent the Lennar money meant for a new park, Haddad had to win over the five-person city council on a new plan. FivePoint would develop the park in exchange for the right to sell more homesites. During a 10-minute break before the vote, in 2013, he walked to a private council room to offer some last-minute concessions, the OC Register reported. The vote, at 1:48 a.m., gave FivePoint most of what it needed. Haddad felt \u201cexcited and relieved,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I just want to go get some sleep.\u201d\nStill, over time FivePoint\u2019s board soured on Haddad. They felt he cared more about vision rather than selling land at a premium, the person familiar with the company said. In came Hedigan, an Irvine Company alum and an attorney, though Haddad remained on the board and is an advisor.\nHedigan oversaw the crucial shift of entitlements from Shipyard to Candlestick, beginning in 2023 when he said on an earnings call that the company had initiated the process to \u201cobtain an approvable plan that rebalances the current development entitlements,\u201d or the right to keep going on Candlestick while while the Shipyard remains stalled.\nCandlestick would become a \u201cstandalone development,\u201d he said, later adding in a 2024 earnings call that the approvals would serve \u201cas a catalyst for advancing conversations\u201d with potential partners. The approvals came November that year. Still, the company\u2019s shares are trading at about $6 lately, compared to about $15 at the end of the day it went public, and shareholders have all but written off the San Francisco project.\nT\nhe parcel that could\nThere was one piece of the Shipyard whose remediation went smoothly, about 70 acres on the tip of Hunters Point. The Navy had handed it to San Francisco all the way back in 2004, before the project\u2019s troubles began. In 2005, San Francisco conveyed the parcel, known as Parcel A, to Lennar, who fought its usual fight \u2014 securing approvals, negotiating land deals, and battling complaints and concerns about gentrification\u2014 before breaking ground in 2013.\nLennar never transferred Parcel A to FivePoint and itself built hundreds of homes. \u201cIt will be the next full neighborhood in San Francisco,\u201d a Lennar executive said in 2014. \u201cAlmost a city within a city.\u201d\nThe first 88 townhomes sold out in early 2015, a sign that even once-toxic sites could spur demand if they could get to the finish line.\nAll the while, Candlestick was undergoing demolition \u2014 and in Southern California, Great Park was\nbeginning\nto bloom, and Valencia was getting closer to take-off.\nBut at the Shipyard, everything outside of Parcel A was frozen. Though Lennar eventually delivered 450 townhomes and condos, the skeleton crew who moved in never felt like they lived in a flourishing master-planned urban community (there\u2019s not even a grocery store yet), though they were grateful for the neighborhood\u2019s affordability.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really,\u201d one resident told the San Francisco Standard in 2024, conceding that he wasn\u2019t bothered by the quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very walkable,\u201d another said to the same reporter. \u201cIf you want to go out to dinner, you\u2019re driving.\u201d\nHomes still for sale at Lennar\u2019s Shipyard are asking for as low as $400,000. Listings describe them as in a prime location directly on the San Francisco Bay. Four are move-in ready, two are labeled \u201cfuture release.\u201d\nS\ntaying relevant\nCandlestick could finally break ground this year, though on the adjacent peninsula. FivePoint now has to solidify its financing in a very different world.\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure head told the San Francisco Business Times in 2024 that FivePoint informed him it had the funds on hand to break ground. The company does have $350 million cash on its balance sheet and access to another $217.5 million revolving credit facility, according to filings. That, plus Great Park Neighborhoods revenues could fund early development of Candlestick, and perhaps the firm can pace itself there until it has more clarity on when it\u2019ll actually get some or all of Shipyard from the Navy, according to Robert Rulla, a Fitch Ratings analyst.\nWhen it does need more capital, a pipeline of sites at Candlestick could provide more collateral to a lender. During recent earnings calls, Hedigan has changed his wording from saying the company continues to \u201cexplore opportunities to bring in a strategic partner or other capital sources\u201d to a slightly looser phrasing: The company \u201cremains engaged with potential capital sources to advance development,\u201d he said in the latest earnings call in October, reporting third-quarter 2025 results. Other firms on the West Coast that already have entitlements can\u2019t finance them, a knowledgeable insider said.\nThere will be plenty of time to engage lenders. Although cases concerning the botched cleanup could finally head to trial early this year, the Navy doesn\u2019t expect to transfer the Shipyard land until at least 2036, according to an agreement between San Francisco and the developer.\nWill California have solved the housing crisis by then? Will demand for San Francisco living persuade homebuyers to try these twin peninsulas?\nIf FivePoint finishes Candlestick and Shipyard, it may owe its success to Hedigan, who\u2019s kept the developer\u2019s reputation for doing hard things, even if the market doesn\u2019t have the patience for his timeline. But to bring them to life, the company could do well to heed the advice from its ex-CEO\u2019s 2012 TED Talk, about relevance.\n\u201cWe cannot survive unless we\u2019re relevant,\u201d Haddad said.",

        "content": "Multifamily syndication is an unlikely corner of real estate for a guy like Jon Venetos.\nInvestors who adopted the pooled-equity model of multifamily acquisition have a reputation. They\u2019re snake-oil salesmen for passive income, spreading the gospel of the value-add proposition to lawyers and doctors on LinkedIn: Give us money, and we\u2019ll buy old apartments, fix them up, raise the rents, sell the properties and get you an easy profit.\nMany syndicators got into the game when they were young and inexperienced. Take Sean Kia, who co-founded Tides Equities in 2016 at the age of 25. His work spawned headlines like Entrepreneur\u2019s \u201cThis 31-Year-Old Investor Nearly Quadrupled His Multifamily Housing Empire From California to Texas in Just 3 Years.\u201d\nWithin nine months of that story, Kia and his partner Ryan Andrade were begging investors for more cash. The foreclosures ramped up in 2024 as Tides\u2019 shabby apartment assets deteriorated. Then, lenders started pursuing the pair down for the loans they personally guaranteed.\nThe unraveling of Tides was the canary in the coal mine for aggressive multifamily investors and syndicators. The wave of distress then buffeted Alan Stalcup\u2019s GVA and Jay Gajavelli\u2019s Applesway Investment Group.\nVenetoses opened Lurin Capital the same year as Tides. The value proposition was similar, but the guy in charge seemed different.\nVenetos and his wife, Ashley, came up at prestigious banks and hedge funds. After launching at Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, Jon joined Citadel in 2006, rising to head of one of the fund\u2019s stock-picking units, Surveyor Capital. Ashley did investor relations at Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square.\nThe pair enjoyed the fruits of their finance paychecks, buying two penthouses in a five-story building at 87 Mercer Street in Soho. They combined the units and tapped Tony Ingrao to remodel them into a luxurious 6,700-square-foot pad, complete with a multi-level rooftop whose hot tub installation required a crane. They again hired Ingrao to design a shingled Hamptons mansion for the 2.3-acre tract they bought in Sagaponack in 2013.\nBut in 2016, a purge at Surveyor \u2014 whose primary funds tumbled at the beginning of the year \u2014 included Jon. He took a sharp turn, listing the penthouse, selling the 12,000-square-foot Hamptons estate for $15.8 million, moving to Dallas and pivoting to real estate.\n\u201cI saw a really inefficient market in real estate, specifically in the multifamily space,\u201d Venetos said on the Real Crowd Podcast in October 2022, the only time he\u2019s spoken publicly.\nHe thought he could professionalize the niche, introducing best practices from the big dogs on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cThere was a significant amount of what we could define in the fundamental equity business as \u2018alpha,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThis thesis formed the basis of his multifamily portfolio, which peaked at 10,000 apartment units in 19 markets across five states.\nPlus, he had a family advantage: The Venetoses had been investing in apartments in Chicago for decades, he said.\nBut neither pedigree nor legacy were enough to save him, and it was just a matter of time before he met the same fate as his contemporaries. In the fall of 2025 came a\ncrush\nof foreclosures, default lawsuits and receivership appointments. In the hunt for money still owed to lenders and limited partners, suggestions of fraudulent dealings surfaced.\nLenders were suing on a near-daily basis by early December. Lurin Capital\u2019s mounting legal trouble started to hint of more than mismanagement or bad timing: One lawsuit accused Venetos of falsifying documents to lenders; another accused him of pocketing loan proceeds while in default. That\u2019s when former employees started coming out of the woodwork with claims that fraud was part of Lurin\u2019s operation \u2014 not just a symptom of distress.\nThat fits with trends loan servicers have tracked, according to Trimont\u2019s Rob Walton. Fraud is prevalent in Class C Texas multifamily \u201cin a way I didn\u2019t ever expect to see,\u201d he said at a multifamily conference in Dallas in August.\nIt is unclear where the Venetos are; the family moved to an Aspen mansion for a while this fall before lenders sued to foreclose on that property too. Venetos did not agree to be interviewed for the story or comment on the claims. Lurin and Venetos have denied claims made in lawsuits by their lenders.\nD\nown to Dallas\nThe Venetoses swapped their posh New York life for the large-format stateliness of Dallas\u2019 well-heeled.\nJon and Ashley moved to Highland Park, the neighborhood where Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones lives.\nThey bought the Italianate Craftsman at 4001 Miramar Avenue in 2021, a few months after the nearly 6,000-square-foot tan brick home got a glowing profile in local real estate blog Candy\u2019s Dirt. Built in 1920 for a Waco cotton merchant, it\u2019s framed by mature trees that shade the backyard and pool on an almost half-acre lot.\nThe mansion is also a block from the Dallas Country Club, and Ashley embraced the role of Highland Park wife, making multiple appearances in the Lone Star State\u2019s society rag, Paper City.\n\u201cJust give me my damn K1 and I can write this off.\u201d\nReddit user who claimed to have invested in Lurin and is ready to count their losses\nIn October 2024, she was photographed at the grand finale of Two x Two for AIDS and Art Gala, a storied Dallas fete that has drawn celebs like Alan Cumming, Natasha Richardson and Sigourney Weaver during its two-decade run. She cut a chic figure in a white skirt and cropped short-sleeve jacket, bracelets piled past her wrist; guests drank Dom Perignon and ate a four-course meal that included Regiis Ova ossetra caviar, per Culture Map.\nMeanwhile, Jon wasted no time building his multifamily empire.\nLurin launched four funds between June 2016 and January 2017, Securities and Exchange filings show. The first fund didn\u2019t have a capped offering, but the second fund offered $3 million and sold $2.98 million. The third offered $7 million and sold $6.95 million. The fourth fund sold $4.8 million of its $5 million offering. The minimum investment in the Lurin funds ranged from $5,000 to $10,000.\nIn December 2018, he signed an office lease at Rosewood Court at 2101 Cedar Springs Road, a prestigious office address in Uptown, across the street from the Crescent, the mixed-use development that anchors the sought-after neighborhood.\nFrom 2016 on, he bought a few apartment complexes in the Sun Belt each year. Purchasing ramped up in 2021 and 2022. The priciest was The Delmar, a 689-unit waterfront apartment building in Tampa that he picked up for $132.8 million in 2022. The acquisition seemed to announce that Lurin had moved into a bigger sandbox, capable of managing assets that were bigger and more centrally located than prior purchases, like The Beacon, a 223-unit complex in Huntsville, Alabama, which Lurin snapped up for $15.8 million in 2021.\nThe local business world took notice. Lurin Capital came in seventh on the annual list of fastest-growing small private companies in North Texas conducted by Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business. The list is based on percentage growth and absolute dollar growth.\nT\nhe Venetos playbook\nLike fellow syndicators, Venetos focused on buying rental properties built after 1970 in high-growth markets. Unlike his peers, the cornerstone of the Venetos approach was rate caps.\nWhen syndicators were sweeping through Texas and picking up apartment complexes, interest rates were low. Some syndicators seemed to think they\u2019d always be. But this wasn\u2019t Venetos\u2019 first rodeo. He sensed rates would come back up again, and he paid to protect himself from that inevitability.\nDocuments provided by a former employee show that Lurin spent between 0.54 and 0.59 percent of the loan value on rate caps for three properties the firm purchased in Alabama in April 2021. The cost of rate caps quickly shot up when rates started increasing: Lurin bought a rate cap that cost more than 2.3 percent of the loan tied to a fourth Alabama property purchased in June 2022. The four caps in question cost between $76,000 and $406,000, including a $6,000 rate cap broker fee for each. They were attached to loans whose values ranged from $12.8 million to $21.8 million.\n\u201cWe have a deal where we paid sub $300,000 for interest rate cap. Today that\u2019s worth $4 million,\u201d he said in the 2022 podcast interview.\nVenetos\u2019 playbook also involved reducing exposure to external cost drivers like inflation by keeping things in the family. The Lurin Capital umbrella includes Lurin\u2019s in-house property management company Steward + Helm (which rebranded in 2024), Lurin Construction Services, Lurin Construction Management and Integrated Solutions and Integrated Renovations, two Lurin-owned companies that perform repairs, like roofing and unit upgrades.\nVenetos doesn\u2019t come off as braggadocious in the one-hour episode, but he gives the impression of an outsider who knows he\u2019s the expert.\nHe was \u201csuper surprised to hear\u201d that data-driven decision-making \u201cwas an exception rather than a rule\u201d in real estate, he said to the host. Government didn\u2019t have the answers. \u201cI think the Fed will overshoot and cause a deeper recession,\u201d he said.\nC\nrash out\nThe rapid interest rate hikes starting in 2022 proved a fatal blow for multifamily syndicators who took out floating rate debt and didn\u2019t have rate caps.\nDebt service payments ballooned. Construction costs soared. Outfits like Tides Equities and GVA effectively lost everything.\nVenetos held on longer, thanks to the rate cap play.\nBut three years later, problems hit in quick succession.\nIn April, lender Acore Capital Mortgage said Lurin defaulted on $384 million in loans tied to 12 properties in the Florida panhandle. The lender started auctioning off those properties in the spring and went after Venetos for what was left, claiming he\u2019d personally guaranteed the loans and still owed $81 million.\nBy fall, Lurin\u2019s lenders were in various stages of wresting control of Lurin properties and trying to get Venetos to pay what he still owed. Fannie Mae sued Venetos in November for defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex and asked the court to appoint a receiver, claiming the conditions \u201cpresent immediate danger to tenants.\u201d Keybank did the same, claiming in a lawsuit that Lurin defaulted on $24 million in loans tied to two Dallas properties. In its lawsuit, Vista Bank alleged that he still owed $3 million after the lender took back a Lurin property at a foreclosure sale. A lender from Luxembourg, Select Securities Europe, sued Lurin, claiming it defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nAll told, at least five lenders accused Lurin of defaulting on $710 million in loans tied to Sun Belt properties.\nA December lawsuit from Lurin\u2019s office landlord lays out a similar timeline.\nLurin missed a rent payment in October 2024 but caught up after two notices of default in November, landlord Rosewood Property Company wrote in a lawsuit. Lurin\u2019s last rent payment was made in May 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October and ordered the company to vacate, which it did in November.\nBy the end of six months, more than half of Lurin\u2019s holdings were in foreclosure proceedings or had already been handed back to lenders.\nLurin\u2019s remaining properties are mostly in receivership or foreclosure proceedings. Local municipalities have gotten involved after complaints about the decrepit state of the complexes.\nA Collin County judge on Oct. 27 issued a temporary restraining order on behalf of the city of Plano against Lurin and ordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments, an apartment complex there, to evacuate, deeming the property \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d\nThe property had racked up nearly 1,500 code violations. At the time the order was issued, residents did not have access to water, sewer or gas at the apartment complex. City official Curtis Howard called it \u201cthe worst apartment complex we have in the city of Plano.\u201d\nThis reality was starkly different from Venetos\u2019s take in 2022, when he critiqued the real estate world for not valuing human capital.\n\u201cThe people who operate your property, the people who support your properties, the people who reside in your property, the community, are all paramount to your success of that asset,\u201d he said in the same podcast interview.\nNow, it\u2019s the same groups \u2014 investors, tenants and employees \u2014 suffering most from his collapse.\n\u201cI have accepted that we as investors are totally screwed, there won\u2019t be any scraps after the banks and attorneys get whatever is left. Just give me my damn K1 and I can write this off,\u201d one Reddit user wrote on a thread about Lurin.\nDispatches from current and former residents of former Lurin properties paint a grisly picture of what can happen when value-add multifamily investors have financial trouble.\nAlondra Mendoza has lived at Estancia Estates, an apartment complex at 2222 Graycliff Drive in Dallas, for 15 years. The place was recently taken over by Dallas-based Indio Management, but during Lurin\u2019s tenure, work orders went unanswered.\n\u201cMy dad would fix everything at home,\u201d she said. When the building had a plumbing issue, Mendoza\u2019s family and her upstairs neighbor forked over $1,000 each to fix it, since Lurin wouldn\u2019t, she claimed.\nRegina Carruth, a resident of the Declan, at 1615 John West Road in Dallas, under Lurin\u2019s ownership, said the property fell into such disarray that \u201csquatters were coming in, kicking into empty apartments and staying in there.\u201d Her air conditioning didn\u2019t work for two months during the summer of 2023, the third-hottest summer in Dallas-Fort Worth on record.\n\u201cIt was just horrible,\u201d she said.\nThings got worse when Lurin stopped paying vendors altogether. Trash was an issue. At Estancia Estates, Mendoza said the dumpster was overflowing to the extent that \u201cthe trash took up half of the street.\u201d\nI\nnner workings\nOne investor surmised that Lurin didn\u2019t repurchase rate caps after they expired in 2023 and 2024, \u201cwhich made many of their properties [go] to a 3-4x higher rate, making things go to sh*t and belly up,\u201d per a Reddit post.\nBut lender lawsuits provide a first glimpse of something worse.\nKeybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere.\nEmployees say the fraud went deeper.\nA former employee who worked in property management and asked to remain anonymous claimed Lurin lied on reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done. That meant Venetos could access new tranches of money before he\u2019d reached the thresholds in his renovations when they were supposed to be disbursed.\nIn an email sent after an inspection of The Sutton in Alabama, a lender rep picked up on the problem. \u201cNone of the units inspected are 100% complete as requested in the draw,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe roofing line item is 97% drawn with no work completed or materials on site.\u201d\n\u201cUninhabitable.\u201d\nA Collin County judge ordering residents of Evana Grove Apartments, a Lurin property in Plano, Texas, to evacuate\nThe lender also points out dramatic inconsistencies between the value of repairs and what was invoiced to complete the work: \u201cFor example the parking lot on the LURIN pay app is valued at ~52K and is 100% drawn while the Integrated Solutions deposit invoice values parking lot work at $210K\u201d \u2014 meaning Lurin budgeted $52,000 for the repair on an application and certification document, but submitted an invoice to its lender for $210,000. Integrated Solutions is Lurin\u2019s in-house renovations company.\n\u201cThe LURIN schedule of values need to line up with the contracts you have in place,\u201d the lender wrote.\nReal estate owners often create their own property management and construction companies to do the work at properties they own \u2014 in that, Lurin wasn\u2019t unusual.\nAt best, the coziness of these entities simply means they\u2019re fully integrated. But at worse, it means that operators can move money from an operating firm to a property management firm with little oversight.\nVenetos didn\u2019t just mislead lenders, employees claim.\nTwo former employees said Lurin stopped being eligible to offer a 401(k) plan to employees this fall but never informed employees. They provided documentation that shows their 401(k) contributions were withdrawn from their paychecks in November but not deposited into their Fidelity-managed 401(k) accounts.\nC\nonundrum Valley\nWhen things started going south, the Venetoses went north and west \u2014 to Aspen.\nThe family moved to a 4,882-square-foot manse, at 82 Winding Way Road, which they bought in April 2022. It\u2019s billed as a \u201cluxury estate compound in the Conundrum Valley,\u201d an apt location for the Dallas refugees. The blocky home, covered in reclaimed vintage barnwood, looks more like an angular office building. They bought the house and an adjacent 7.6 acres for $18 million.\nIn a Dec. 22 response to the lawsuit brought by Keybank, Venetos confirmed he and Ashley are living in Colorado, but little has emerged about what they are doing there.\nThe house\u2019s lender foreclosed in December, and it\u2019s not clear where the Venetoses are living now. A recent legal document identified a Venetos-backed LLC as having an address at 625 East Main Street, Suite 102, in Aspen.\nThe couple also finally sold their Soho penthouse \u2014 the traditional way, though below asking. The new buyer paid $17.4 million, less than a quarter of the $81 million judgment Acore is seeking. The penthouse was first listed in 2017, long before the Lurin collapse, for $29.9 million.\nMeanwhile, Lurin is fighting the default lawsuits on its remaining properties. The firm denies allegations made by Fannie Mae, claiming the lender interfered in the management of the property and forced Lurin to miss a loan payment \u201cwhich created a domino effect from which Lurin could not possibly recover.\u201d\nLurin has hung onto a few properties, like Valley Estates, at 929 Saint Paul Drive in Richardson, outside Dallas. Indio was tapped to manage two DFW properties currently in receivership, including Estancia Estates, where Mendoza lives.\nOn a December morning, reps from Indio were putting up Christmas decorations in the leasing office, and a team of men were working all over the property. Most of the doors and windows had been boarded up with plywood.\n\u201cIt looks promising,\u201d Mendoza said of the repairs.\nVenetos\u2019 victims up the chain are looking for answers too. They\u2019re also looking for Venetos, in Aspen \u201cor wherever else he may be found,\u201d as Rosewood put it in their December lawsuit against him.",

        "content": "Old office space is a millstone around the neck of Houston, and investors spent 2025\u00a0 trying to break free.\nFittingly, the\nbiggest office sale of 2025\nin Bayou City was the return of Houston\u2019s largest office complex to its lender. There\u2019s a bright side to the city\u2019s glum office market for\nowner-occupiers\n, or buyers who would rather use the space they own rather than leasing. Such buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the Houston office market in 2025, Partners Real Estate concluded.\nHere are Houston\u2019s biggest office trades of 2025 based on data provided by Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nHouston Center | 1221 &amp; 1301 McKinney Street &amp; 909 Fannin Street | 4.6 million square feet\nIn the\nbiggest office transaction\nof the year, Brookfield Properties handed Houston Center over to its mezzanine lender in April. A joint venture between pension fund AustralianSuper and Stream Realty took control of the sprawling four-building, 4.6 million-square-foot office campus that Brookfield bought in 2017. Despite Brookfield\u2019s efforts to modernize the property, it\u2019s still been bleeding tenants in recent years, including LyondellBasell, which left 358,000 square feet, and Norton Rose Fulbright, which left a 350,000-square-foot block.\n5555 San Felipe Street | 1.19 million square feet\nThe city\u2019s\nsecond-largest office sale\nreflected the rising trend of owner occupants taking advantage of old office buildings\u2019 low valuations. Dallas-based midstream energy giant Energy Transfer bought the building formerly known as Marathon Oil Tower, at 5555 San Felipe Street, from Starwood Property Trust in April. Starwood floated a possible residential conversion at the 41-story building, but nothing materialized. Starwood took control of the tower in 2022 after prior owner M-M Properties defaulted on an $88 million loan. The 1.2 million-square-foot tower, built in 1983 as the headquarters for Marathon Oil, underwent a $15 million renovation completed in 2022.\nLake Pointe Plaza | 1 Fluor Daniel Drive | 1.17 million square feet\nThe next building on the list is being eyed for demolition. Lovett Commercial is moving forward with plans to transform the former Fluor campus in Sugar Land into a $1 billion mixed-use community. The Houston-based firm bought the property, which includes a nearly 1.2 million-square-foot office campus, in the second quarter of the year and\nproposed plans\nfor the 53-acre redevelopment project in April. Lovett\nsecured approval\nfrom the local zoning commission in the fall for Lake Pointe Green, a 53-acre community that could feature up to 720 multifamily units. This isn\u2019t the first time a\ndeveloper tried to reimagine\nthe campus\nFluor vacated\nin 2023. Sugar Land-based Planned Community Developers took a stab at the project, but plans fell through.\nBrookhollow Central I, II &amp; III | 2800, 2900 &amp; 2950 North Loop Freeway | 810,091 square feet\nThe\nsale of Brookhollow Central\nis also a distress story. A British Virgin Islands court ordered the owner Hertz Investment Group to liquidate its U.S. assets in 2024 to repay $145 million owed to Israeli bondholders. A joint venture of Dominus Commercial of Irving and Houston-based Meneses Holdings reportedly paid a bargain basement price for the three-building, 810,000-square-foot office complex: $58.4 million, or $72 a square foot. Hertz paid $70.5 million ($87 per square foot) for the property in 2018.\n717 Texas | 717 Texas Avenue | 697,195 square feet\nHines offloaded 717 Texas, its downtown theater district office building that\u2019s anchored by electricity company Calpine. Hines and Prime Asset Management developed the building in 2003 and renovated it in 2019. The buyer was New York Life.\nOne City Center | 1021 Main Street | 594,595 square feet\n3L Real Estate envisions a second act for\nOne City Center\n. The Chicago-based developer bought the downtown office tower, at 1021 Main Street, from Accesso Partners after special servicer Midland took over the property. It\u2019s been in a downward spiral since 2020 when its largest tenant, Waste Management, left, leaving it about 90 percent empty. 3L plans to convert the property into 93 corporate suites for visiting employees and 460 traditional apartments.\nThirty Forty Post Oak | 3040 Post Oak Boulevard | 425,199 square feet\nBraun Enterprises\npicked up the 426,000-square-foot office building, at 3040 Post Oak Boulevard with plans for an extensive renovation. The 22-story tower was about 82 percent leased at the time. Planned upgrades include a fitness center, coffee bar, lobby refresh and exterior enhancements.\nClear Lake Central | 600 Gemini Street | 363,050 square feet\nJet Lending took control of Gemini Office Park near Houston\u2019s Space Port after owner JMK5 Holdings defaulted on a $4.95 million loan tied to the property. The two-story, 363,000-square-foot office complex was built in 1986 and renovated in 2021. It\u2019s home to Houston-based spacesuit maker\nAxiom Aerospace\n, which has a 180,000-square-foot lease at the property.\nEnergy Center I | 585 North Dairy Ashford | 339,764 square feet\nAl Khor Holding picked up an office property in Houston\u2019s coveted Energy Corridor, a submarket squarely at the top of corporate tenants\u2019 office wishlists. Energy Center I, at 585 North Dairy Ashford, was previously owned by Spear Street Capital. The 13-story property built in 2008 and renovated in 2020 is home to Omaha, Nebraska-based Kiewit Engineering, which\nadded 106,000 square feet\nto its lease in 2023 for a total of 277,105 square feet.\nKirkwood Tower | 11757 Katy Freeway | 280,436 square feet\nA final\ndistress sale\nto wrap up the list: Apollo Global Management ownership of Kirkwood Tower after owner Gemini Rosemont defaulted on a $30.9 million loan from Voya Insurance. The 15-story office property sheathed in black glass was built in 1984 and renovated in 2015.",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group paid\n$520 million\nfor a bayfront Brickell property, marking the biggest development site sale in Miami and likely the state.\nThe December trade added fuel to the real estate industry\u2019s narrative that Miami\u2019s financial district is a prime market, insulated from the headwinds felt in most of the rest of the tri-county region and much of the nation, including elevated interest rates.\nSome lenders still are skittish, as South Florida has felt the sting in recent years from higher insurance and materials costs.\nYet, Brickell remains a prime target for investors and developers. It became a\nmagnet\nfor out-of-state companies in the first years of the pandemic, as well as\nresidential development.\n\\\nMost of the tri-county region\u2019s top development site deals have been in Brickell, with a few exceptions. Here\u2019s a look at some of Miami\u2019s most notable urban land sales over the years.\nOKO and Oak Row\u2019s new record\nMiami-based OKO and Oak Row, with offices in New York and Miami, paid $122.4 million per acre for the 4.25-acre Brickell site.\nPart of the purchase was financed by $85 million in transferable seller financing notes, according to Aimco\u2019s Dec. 22 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe property consists of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive. Both are income-producing.\nFor the first phase of their redevelopment, OKO and Oak Row plan a hotel and branded condos, they said in a news release.\nThe project will add to the surge in development of branded residences in South Florida, as the tri-county region is the\nepicenter\nof such projects in North America, according to Knight Frank. Miami had\n48 completed\nand 55 planned branded projects as of last month, second only to Dubai, according to Savills.\nThe Brickell property can be developed with multiple supertalls totaling more than 3 million square feet across property types. The Federal Aviation Administration caps heights in Miami to 1,049 feet. The site has 485 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard led the CBRE team that marketed the Aimco site. Aimco, which last month announced a\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slower multifamily market nationwide, listed the property last year, asking about\n$650 million\n.\nKen Griffin\u2019s HQ supertall site\nFor the past three years, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin held the record for the biggest South Florida development site deal.\nIn 2022, an entity tied to Griffin paid\n$363 million\n\u2013\u2013 or $145.2 million per acre \u2013\u2013 for the 2.5-acre vacant bayfront site at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, also in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nGriffin, who moved his hedge fund Citadel and sister market marker company Citadel Securities\u2019 headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022, plans a 1,032-foot-tall supertall tower on the site. Designed by starchitect Norman Foster\u2019s firm, the\n$1 billion\n-plus project will have 1.3 million square feet of office space on the first 34 floors, including space for the headquarters for Citadel and Citadel Securities. The firms are temporarily leasing space elsewhere, including at 830 Brickell.\nSome of the office space at the supertall will be leased to other companies.\nThe 54-story project also will have 212 hotel keys on the upper floors, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and an over 5,200-square-foot health and spa area with open space. In January, Griffin and New York-based Related Companies, led by Jeff Blau and President Bruce Beal Jr., announced they are\npartnering\non the project.\nThe site was long slated for a supertall. The Hollo family\u2019s Florida East Coast Realty, which sold the land to Griffin, and Corigin Real Estate Group and Frank McCourt\u2019s McCourt Global Properties had planned a pair of 1,049-foot-tall buildings on the property that never came to fruition. That project also was designed by Foster + Partners.\nSite of Swire\u2019s scrapped office supertall\nSwire Properties revealed its planned One Brickell City Centre supertall in 2022. This year, Swire Properties, which is the real estate arm of Hong Kong-based Swire, sold the 2.8-acre site for\n$211.5 million\n.\nMiami-based Melo Group, led by brothers Carlos and Martin Melo, bought the site at 700 and 799 Brickell Avenue in Miami in May for $75.5 million per acre. Melo Group, which has built over 8,000 condos and rentals in Miami and was started by the Argentine family\u2019s patriarch, Jose\u00a0 Luis Ferreira de Melo, hasn\u2019t revealed development plans for the property.\nSwire, which at one point was to partner with Related Companies on the project, had planned on a 1,000-foot-tall tower with 1.4 million square feet offices. It scored approval for some of the largest floor plates in Miami, from 40,000 square feet on upper floors to 60,000 square feet on lower floors.\nThis year, Swire\nscrapped\nthe office supertall just as the pandemic-era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida slowed. (Related wasn\u2019t involved in the project by then.) Swire Properties President Henry Bott\ntold Bloomberg\n\u201cthe pre-leasing for that specific scheme has not materialized in the way that we had hoped.\u201d\nBecause of the tower\u2019s large size, it required significant pre-leasing before it could secure a construction loan. Though out-of-state firms took big blocks of space from late 2020 through 2022, their appetite to Miami offices waned in subsequent years.\nThe Aston Martin condos site\nIn 2014, a trio of developers sold the 1.25-acre bayfront lot next to the Epic Residences &amp; Hotel in downtown Miami for\n$125 million\n\u2013\u2013 one of the top deals at the time. It broke down to $100 million per acre.\nBuyer G&amp;G Business Developments, led by German Coto of the Argentine Coto Supermarkets family, completed the 66-story, 391-unit Aston Martin Residences condo on the property last year.\nThe sellers of the property at 300 Biscayne Boulevard Way were Spanish billionaire\nAmancio Ortega\u2019s\nPontegadea family investment firm, Ugo Colombo of Miami-based CMC Group and Diego Lowenstein. Ortega and CMC Group completed the adjacent 54-story Epic with 414 hotel keys and 362 condos, in 2008.\nDubai firm buys Surfside collapse site\nDubai-based Damac Properties closed on its\n$120 million\npurchase of the Surfside collapse site in 2022.\nThe 12-story Champlain Towers South, at 8777 Collins Avenue, collapsed in the early morning of June 24, 2021, killing 98 people. The judge overseeing the class-action lawsuit over the tragedy ordered the sale of the oceanfront property. Damac was the sole bidder.\nFounded by billionaire\nHussain Sajwani\n, Damac has developed luxury condos, many of them branded, across the Middle East and London. Damac\u2019s Surfside project is its first ground-up development in the U.S.\nDamac\nlaunched sales of its planned luxury 12-story, 37-unit development, called Delmore, a year ago. Designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, Delmore will consist of four- and five-bedroom condos, averaging more than 7,000 square feet with asking prices starting at $15 million. Penthouses will start at 10,000 square feet.\nDamac\u2019s purchase broke down to about $60 million per acre for the nearly 2-acre site.\nThe biggest deal that never closed\nIn 2023, a group of investors led by David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra was in line to purchase the Miami Herald\u2019s former bayfront site for\n$1.2 billion\n. But the deal, which would have set an all-time record for Florida, was\ncalled off\ntwo months after Terra and its partners put the 15-acre site under contract.\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based gambling operator Genting Group listed the land at 1431 North Bayshore Drive in Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District, which represents more than half of Genting\u2019s holdings in the area.\nWhen Smart City Miami, the Terra-led group, put the property under contract, it gave a\nboost\nto the market, giving momentum for other South Florida deals at a time of higher interest rates and other headwinds.\nIn a joint statement about the deal cancellation, Smart City and Genting said the buyers sought amendments to the purchase terms and an extension to the due diligence period. At the time, it was expected that either Smart City would submit another bid or that Genting would renegotiate with some of the other four bidders. The property remains unsold.\nGenting paid $236 million for the 14.6-acre ex-Herald site in 2011, marking the top development site deal at the time. The newspaper\u2019s building was subsequently torn down.\nIf Smart City had closed on its $1.2 billion purchase, that deal would have penciled out to $77.4 million per acre.\n",

        "content": "HUBB NYC was among the buyers who closed out 2025 striking deals in Brooklyn.\nThe firm acquired 599 Baltic Street from Adam America for $40 million last week, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal works out to $571,000 per unit for the 70-unit building, which appears to feature both rentals and condominiums.\nJLL Real Estate Capital provided a $29.7 million acquisition loan to HUBB for the purchase. None of the parties in the deal commented to the Observer on the transaction.\nOmri Sachs\u2019 Adam America developed the nine-story building six years ago. It was part of a company portfolio of multifamily properties, including assets in Connecticut, Florida and Texas.\nFor HUBB, the acquisition was the culmination of a push in the borough to end 2025.\nIn November, HUBB acquired a 12-story, 105-unit multifamily building at 177 Front Street in Dumbo from the Carlyle Group\nfor $85 million\n. JLL Real Estate Capital was also involved in a lender position there, assuming a $43.3 million mortgage on the property.\nFounded in 2011, HUBB often positions itself as an all-cash buyer and features more than 80 properties in its portfolio. An affiliate of the company recently\npaid $20.3 million\nfor an apartment building at 254 Water Street; the seller of the 26-unit property was Michael Alvandi\u2019s City Urban Realty, which purchased the property in 2019 for $15 million.\nElsewhere in Gowanus, Midwood Investment &amp; Development\nsecured a $200 million construction loan\nfrom Affinius Capital for its 21-story, 276-unit multifamily project at 200 Douglass Street.\nThe development will include 20,000 square feet of retail space and a variety of amenities. The expected completion date is in the fall of 2027.\nGowanus grew in stature several years ago when the neighborhood was rezoned in 2021, a measure expected to add more than 8,000 apartments to the area over the span of a decade.\u00a0\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Related Group, Dezer Development and BH Group filed plans for their oceanfront condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach, months after acquiring the older condo complex that occupies the property.\nThe partnership\ncompleted a $131.8 million buyout\nof the 108-unit Miami Beach Club at 19051 Collins Avenue last summer, with plans for a luxury condo tower. The two-story Miami Beach Club was constructed in 1951 on a 2-acre site immediately north of\nResidences by Armani/Casa\n, a luxury condo tower that Related and Dezer co-developed.\nIn May, permit filings were submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration for a building that would be 828 feet above sea level or 820 feet above ground for the new project.\nOver the past year, the Related-Dezer-BH venture submitted plans to the city of Sunny Isles, obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, that included renderings of the proposed high-rise, details about the project and the breakdown in ownership.\nThe project\nMB RE Investments LLC is the developer. An ownership chart submitted to Sunny Isles in December 2024 shows that a Delaware entity, BLFO MBC MEMBER LLC, owns 75 percent. That LLC is owned by Bahamian entities tied to a Brazilian family. The remaining 25 percent is owned by the developers, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related, the Dezer family firm and Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s BH.\nA letter filed by the developers\u2019 land use attorneys regarding site plan approval states that with bonuses and the transfer of development rights, they plan a 62-story, 145-unit condo tower designed by Cohen Freedman Encinosa &amp; Associates Architects and Enzo Enea\u2019s landscape architecture firm. The developers plan to build a density of about 73 units per acre.\nThe project could cost about $294 million to build, and it has an anticipated completion date of December 2031, according to the letter, which was submitted by attorney Tracy R. Slavens of LSN Law. The developers are seeking up to five years from approval to obtain a building permit, and up to five years from the issuance of a building permit to complete the tower.\nThe tower is expected to include a padel court, pool deck, water features and a sculpture garden on the west-facing side of the property; and a lap pool, outdoor spa, cabanas and beach access on the east.\nThe buyout of Miami Beach Club was in the works for more than a decade.\nRelated owned units through executives, and the firm also created a company in 2013 named after the property\u2019s address. Investor and developer Richard Meruelo, or an entity he previously managed, sold the units to the Related executives, records show. Miami Beach Club\u2019s condo association and at least\none unit owner\nfiled lawsuits against the Related/Dezer entity that developed Residences by Armani/Casa. One lawsuit over construction next door was dismissed in 2022.\nIn Sunny Isles, Dezer is also building Bentley Residences. Dezer Development secured\na $630 million construction loan\nin November from Madison Realty Capital for the 61-story, 216-unit tower, which will mark the first Bentley-branded residential high-rise when it\u2019s completed.\n",

        "content": "AT&amp;T is officially leaving\nDowntown Dallas\n.\nThe telecommunications giant confirmed Monday that it will plant its flag in Plano after months of searching for office space across North Texas, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nA new global headquarters will rise at the 54-acre site at 5400 Legacy Drive in Plano\u2019s Legacy developement, with\nAT&amp;T\ntargeting partial occupancy as early as the second half of 2028.\nThe outlet reported that Stankey framed the decision as a consolidation move, saying the Plano site will allow AT&amp;T to \u201ccost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space,\u201d including major offices in Dallas,\nPlano and Irving\n, while creating a purpose-built corporate campus.\nThe announcement raises fresh questions about AT&amp;T\u2019s long-term commitment to Downtown Dallas, where the company has invested heavily over the past decade. AT&amp;T spent roughly $100 million developing its Discovery District, a splashy downtown campus with a massive outdoor media screen, food hall and public gathering space that opened in 2021.\nAt its peak in 2022, AT&amp;T had nearly 6,000 employees assigned to downtown offices. Its footprint there spans about 2 million square feet across four buildings, anchored by the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street, where its lease runs through 2030. The company relocated its headquarters to Dallas in 2008 after leaving\nSan Antonio\n.\nAT&amp;T told the outlet that internal data showed a majority of employees would have a shorter commute to Plano, a factor that weighed into the decision.\nThe Plano site is owned by Dallas-based\nNexPoint\n, which controls 215 acres that include the former headquarters of Electronic Data Systems, the information technology company founded by Ross Perot. NexPoint had been planning a 4 million-square-foot mixed-use project dubbed the\nTexas Research Quarter\n, aimed at life sciences and advanced manufacturing tenants.\nPlano City Council approved up to $15 million in reimbursements for the redevelopment last year through a new tax increment reinvestment zone. How AT&amp;T\u2019s arrival reshapes those plans remains unclear.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Months after\nsecuring the former\n, Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group landed the latter in Hudson Yards.\nRelated and Oxford scored $1.6 billion in construction financing for their 72-story office tower project at 70 Hudson Yards, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The partners subsequently completed a $2.45 billion recapitalization of the development, according to a statement.\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Standard Chartered underwrote and structured the construction debt. Institutional investors also provided equity for the development.\nRelated and Oxford broke ground on the project in July and anticipate opening the building to tenants by the end of 2028. Top floor leasing is expected to start this year.\nThe 1.4-million-square-foot development represents the nation\u2019s largest ground-up office development since the onset of the pandemic more than a half-decade ago. Amenities will include an event space, private dining, a media-podcast studio and \u201cred eye\u201d suites for use after flights.\nLast spring, accounting and consulting firm Deloitte agreed to lease 800,000 square feet at the property before it broke ground. The space, which includes an 8,000-square-foot terrace, will serve as North American headquarters for the company.\nThe developers are banking on interest from other tenants looking for high-quality office spaces. Judging from leasing activity in Manhattan last year, they should be feeling confident.\nManhattan was on track last month to surpass 40 million square feet worth of deals for the year, which would be the first time it crossed that threshold since 2019. Manhattan office availability came down to 14.2 percent in December, according to Colliers, the lowest rate since late 2020.\nThere were even a couple of leases last year that\ncracked the 1-million-square-foot mark\n; Deloitte\u2019s deal at 70 Hudson Yards was the year\u2019s third-largest lease in the borough.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "For decades, New York\u2019s private clubs were synonymous with wood-paneled dining rooms, academic affiliations and strict dress codes. Stuffy buttoned-up Midtown enclaves like the Penn Club, Harvard Club and Yale Club functioned more as after-hours boardrooms than places to meet up with friends for drinks.\nThat changed in 2003, when London-based social club\nSoho House\ncrossed the Atlantic, opening its first U.S. location in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District. The club signed a lease for 45,000 square feet at the brick loft building at 29 Ninth Avenue, kicking off a new era of private spaces that were hip and exclusive.\nToday, the city is awash in clubs, from stalwarts like Zero Bond and Casa Cipriani, to ZZ\u2019s Member Club from Major Food Group, and the newest entrants such as Moss and Flyfish Club. They\u2019re cropping up in office buildings, hotels and condo towers, adding cachet and amenity value for landlords. At the same time, family-oriented concepts like The Beginning Clubhouse and Kings Athletic Club are\nslated to open\nin vacant properties in Brooklyn, filling less desirable spaces and branding themselves as urban country clubs.\nBrokers are now tracking more than three dozen private clubs operating or in development across the five boroughs. To landlords and dealmakers, the trend has produced one of the most compelling tenant classes in the post-pandemic real estate reset.\n\u201cI think landlords understand the importance of these clubs and how it\u2019ll help them potentially in the leaseability of the asset for cool brands that want an element of cachet or want an element of cool to offer their employees or their clients,\u201d broker Brandon Singer of Retail by MONA said.\nBut to doubters, the sheer volume signals oversaturation. Private clubs typically lock in long-term leases, offering landlords steady rent but little flexibility. If the membership fails to materialize, those cavernous, custom-built spaces can go dark, leaving both club operators and property owners exposed.\n\u201cI think when you have too many that are opening, it\u2019s creating a problem,\u201d Singer said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much money you make, there\u2019s only so many people that can afford that [membership]. So I think you will see a thinning out.\u201d\nF\nrom nightlife to asset class\nThe current private-club boom can be traced, in part, to Zero Bond, a former Brooks Brothers factory at 670 Broadway that helped rewrite the playbook for post-pandemic hospitality.\nWhen Brandon Charnas first encountered the struggling loft building, he was a corporate lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis. But Charnas saw an opportunity. He connected the building\u2019s owner with Paramount Group, whose chief investment officer happened to be a college friend from Penn. In 2015, Charnas brokered the sale of the nearly vacant building to Paramount for $112 million.\nThat move set Charnas\u2019s next deal in motion: persuading Scott Sartiano, newly untethered after selling his nightlife business, to consider the space for a members-only club. He also had to win over Paramount Group.\n\u201cThis was before [the] wave of clubs,\u201d Charnas said. \u201dThey had no idea what it was going to be, and they didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\nBrokers are now tracking more than three dozen private clubs operating or in development across the five boroughs.\nCharnas managed to get approval from the city\u2019s Department of Buildings to change the address of the five-story landmarked property to 0 Bond. After Charnas secured a liquor license, Sartiano inked a 15-year, 20,000-square-foot lease across three floors of the office building. Asking rent was more than $100 per foot.\n\u201cWe got the lease done because we got the liquor license, and it all made sense,\u201d said Charnas, who co-founded Current Real Estate Advisors in 2018.\nThe club debuted in October 2020, when Covid restrictions were loosening, only to close weeks later amid new pandemic rules. It reopened in February 2021, just as the city began to loosen its grip. Since then, it has drawn a Who\u2019s Who of big names, including Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Eric Adams. Zero Bond quickly became a textbook example of how a private club could anchor a building and boost its prestige. It\u2019s \u201cjust grown to this amazing place,\u201d Charnas said.\nAs Zero Bond made its mark, other would-be private club proprietors raced to find pandemic-era deals.\n\u201cThere were a lot of vacant spaces, rents were cheap, so a lot of these clubs swooped in and signed leases,\u201d Singer said.\nV\nenue of their own\nPrivate clubs hit a sweet spot for landlords. They typically sign 10- to 20-year leases, often with extension options. Buildouts are expensive and bespoke, which discourages early exits. Unlike restaurants, clubs generate upfront capital through initiation fees and recurring revenue through regular dues. Landlords frequently contribute to private club buildouts through tenant improvement allowances, rent credits or extended free-rent periods.\n\u201cI work on a lot of these types of deals, and the best ones are where there\u2019s mutual alignment with the business plan between the landlord and the tenant,\u201d attorney Shaun Pappas of Starr Associates said. \u201cThe landlord becomes almost a partner.\u201d\nA private club in an office or residential building also functions as a built-in amenity that helps landlords lease the rest of the building. Moss, which recently opened across five floors at Rabina\u2019s new supertall condo and office tower 520 Fifth Avenue, was conceived to add to the building\u2019s broader value proposition. Pappas negotiated the 40,000-square-foot deal on behalf of the landlord. Both declined to discuss the terms of the lease.\n\u201cAs part of that development, [Rabina] had this member-club idea that\u2019s offered not only for residents, but also to the public,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s offering a little bit more than just a restaurant. It has amenities \u2014 a pool and gym and spa and all those things.\u201d He figures it\u2019ll be well-used in the neighborhood, by\nboth workers and residents\n.\nBrokers themselves patronize clubs as dealmaking venues. Last summer, Pappas brought together three of his real estate developer clients for dinner and drinks on the terrace at Casa Cipriani, one of the three private clubs he belongs to. The setting bred conviviality even though the clients hadn\u2019t previously met.\n\u201cI thought it would be nice for them to get together to talk about war stories,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThat type of thing overlooking the East River on a nice Tuesday night at 7 o\u2019clock while the sun sets is a pretty awesome experience.\u201d\nMembership also means avoiding the scramble of booking a table at the right restaurant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so impossible to even get reservations these days, right?\u201d he added.\nL\neasing versus owning\nNew York\u2019s private club boom is partly about filling a post-pandemic gap for \u201cthird places,\u201d gathering spots that are neither work nor home. Modern clubs double as coworking spaces, social lounges, dining rooms, wellness hubs and\nnetworking spots\n.\n\u201cThat element coming out of Covid of finding alternative safe spaces to congregate and socialize \u2014 there is a continued desire to find third spaces to kind of solve this trend of loneliness,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Aylin Gucalp said.\nClubs are growing more niche in an effort to stand out to potential members.\nIn Brooklyn, a wave of family-friendly clubs is cornering the borough\u2019s kid-packed neighborhoods. Little Big Hospitality is transforming an empty office building at 50 Columbia Heights into The Beginning Clubhouse, a seven-story space with a rooftop pizzeria, screening room, bowling alley and indoor jungle gym. Nearby, Kings Athletic Club will open in Brooklyn Heights with a mix of wellness and hospitality amenities for families.\n\u201cWhat they wanted to do was marry what everybody knows as that sort of private club scene and setting in a family-oriented environment,\u201d Newmark broker Peter Whitenack said. He represented landlord CIM Group at 50 Columbia Heights. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a place where adults are going to go and drop the kids off and have me-time upstairs. There\u2019s interaction with the kids and there\u2019s programming and movie nights.\u201d\nBut such specialized branding and build-outs can be expensive. While landlords love clubs right now, the clubs themselves don\u2019t have much leverage when leases come up for renewal, said Bob Knakal of commercial brokerage BKREA.\n\u201cAfter investing all that and having a location become known as \u2018the place,\u2019 the landlord would really have you [the tenant] in a pickle if you were doing great and your lease came up and they want to triple or quadruple the rent,\u201d Knakal said.\nBKREA is negotiating a deal for a private club planning to expand into New York from another location, Knakal said. The firm is also marketing the former Friars Club building, at 57 East 55th Street, which reverted to the lender in 2025 after the owner defaulted on a $13 million loan. BKREA has received multiple proposals for another private club that wants to buy the property.\n\u201cWe have several folks we talked to that own these clubs that have leased space,\u201d Knakal said. They wished they\u2019d bought instead, they tell him.\nA\ncrowded field\nSky-high dues and a flood of new clubs may be pushing the world behind the velvet rope toward a reckoning.\nAt Zero Bond, annual dues range from $2,750 to $4,400, depending on a member\u2019s age, and are on top of a $750 to $5,000 initiation fee also depending on age, according to the club\u2019s website. Casa Cipriani charges a $2,000 initiation fee plus annual dues of about $3,900, though prices vary. The ultra-exclusive Aman Club requires $15,000 in yearly dues, plus a staggering $200,000 initiation fee.\nMeanwhile, new clubs keep pulling members away from more established spots, in a constant shifting of the social landscape.\n\u201cBasically, you\u2019re going to one place now and then in a year, that place is yesterday\u2019s news,\u201d said Singer, who belongs to Colette, the private club on the 37th floor of the GM Building.\nSinger often pops into Coco\u2019s at Colette from his nearby office for breakfast, lunch or meetings, so he\u2019s still riding the trend, even if it\u2019s not forever.\n\u201cThe best of the best will last and stick around,\u201d he predicted. \u201cAnd I think the balance will shutter.\u201d",

        "content": "When David Schwartz\u2019s Waterton extended its dealmaking streak into Southern California, it notched what\u2019s likely to be the largest Woodland Hills multifamily sale of 2025.\nChicago-based Waterton\u2019s\n$180 million\nacquisition of AMLI Warner Center apartments, now called The Kitt at Warner Center, from AMLI Residential was the priciest multifamily sale in Woodland Hills in the first three quarters of 2025, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data. The deal also\ntopped the entire county\u2019s list\nof multifamily deals.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. Given that full-year data is not yet available at the tax assessor\u2019s office,\nThe Real Deal\nused\nthe county records to rank the top sales for the first three quarters.\nThe 522-unit Kitt at Warner Center went for $344,828 per apartment.\nAMLI Residential developed the San Fernando Valley property at 21200 Kittridge Street about two decades ago. It is within the master-planned community Warner Center, where Stanley Kroenke, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams, has proposed a $10 billion development.\nThe Kitt at Warner Center has one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, a resort-inspired pool and spa, al fresco dining, a fire pit and a gym.\nMonthly rents range from $2,105 to $6,358 for units spanning 695 square feet to 1,375 square feet, according to Apartments.com.\nWhen Waterton acquired the property in July the firm said it would update the units and common areas within the following 12 months.\n\u201cWhat made it attractive was primarily the value-add upside,\u201d Kol Rath, vice president of acquisitions for Waterton, said when\nthe deal was announced\n. \u201cThe vast majority of units are in either original condition from 2007 or have been partially upgraded over the years. The common areas and amenities can be reconfigured and improved.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Kurt Bender waded into a pool of multifamily distress with the latest extension of his firm\u2019s Chicagoland dealmaking streak.\nBender Companies bought a former Sears department store reborn as apartments on Chicago\u2019s North Side for $29 million, closing the book on a foreclosure fight against the property\u2019s previous owner, an offshoot of the embattled Chicago-based development firm\nCA Ventures\n.\nChicago-based Bender bought the four-story property at 1900 West Lawrence Avenue in the Ravenswood neighborhood alongside Denver-based Walker &amp; Dunlop Investment Partners, CoStar\nreported\n. The deal was recorded Dec. 16, according to property records.\nThe sale resolves a foreclosure suit tied to the property\u2019s redevelopment, which converted the long-vacant Sears box into 59 apartments and roughly 19,000 square feet of ground-floor retail about four years ago. The building sits at the corner of Lawrence and Wolcott avenues, steps from the Ravenswood Metra stop.\nThe transaction is described in Cook County records as a sale in lieu of foreclosure. The property had been owned by an entity tied to CA Residential, an affiliate of CA Ventures which partnered with another local firm on the adaptive reuse. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jack Maloney and Brad Smith represented the seller.\nThe deal comes a little more than a year after\nLoanCore Capital\nfiled a $32 million foreclosure complaint against CA Residential, alleging the developer failed to pay off its loan on the property.\nWhile the apartment portion of the building is modest in scale, the retail is fully leased. One tenant is DeVry University\u2019s Advantage Academy, a program that allows Chicago Public Schools high school students to earn college credits in technology-focused courses, giving the property a community-facing component.\nBender\nsaid it plans to invest in both exterior and interior upgrades, including a new fitness space. In a statement, Mark Barnes, the firm\u2019s vice president of investments, pointed to a shortage of larger apartment offerings in Ravenswood as a key driver behind the acquisition.\nThe purchase adds to what\u2019s shaping up as Chicago\u2019s busiest year for multifamily investment sales since 2022. Investors closed on $4.9 billion worth of apartment deals in the metro area in 2025, according to CoStar data, eclipsing the $3.9 billion recorded in all of 2024.\nThe Ravenswood deal marks Bender Companies fifth acquisition of 2025. Other recent acquisitions include a $75.3 million purchase of a 509-unit complex in\nMount Prospect\nand a $75.8 million deal for a 550-unit property in\nHoffman Estates\n, both joint ventures with Eastham Capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Mamdani\u2019s spokesperson later confirmed the appointment.\nLevy \u201cis an experienced and fearless housing leader, and I know that she will fight to protect tenants and tackle our housing crisis head on,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.\nBefore her most recent role at HCR, she wore a number of other hats at the agency. Among her jobs, Levy oversaw the state\u2019s mortgage agency, managed housing grants and led a program upstate for the manufacturing of low-cost homes.\nPreviously, she held roles with the attorney general\u2019s office and with the nonprofit Urban Homesteading Assistance Board.\nIn stepping into the HPD\u2019s top post, Levy will assume charge of an agency with a $2 billion budget that could help steer some of Mamdani\u2019s biggest campaign promises. HPD finances income-restricted housing developments and funds the preservation of existing affordable units.\nLast year, the agency financed the development of more than 13,000 affordable units and the preservation of another 15,000 units, according to the city.

        "content": "Affiliated Development scored a $73 million construction loan for a Live Local Act project in Boynton Beach, amid a rush to build apartments under the state workforce housing law.\nFort Lauderdale-based Affiliated, a workforce and affordable rentals developer, started construction of The Dune with 336 units on a 4.3-acre site at 2607 and 2617 South Federal Highway, steps from the Intracoastal Waterway, according to records and the developer\u2019s news release.\nPacific Life Insurance provided the financing. Affiliated also tapped equity from family office capital partners and its Affiliated Housing Impact Fund, the release says. The firm launched a fund last year, with the goal of raising\n$250 million\nfor mixed-income multifamily projects in Florida.\nThe Dune will consist of an eight-story, 298-unit building; 38 three-story rental townhomes; and retail, the release says. Out of the 336 apartments, 198 will be reserved for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the area median income. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows Palm Beach County\u2019s annual AMI is $111,800. This is expected to be updated in the spring.\nAffiliate\u2019s designation of 59 percent of units as workforce rentals exceeds Live Local\u2019s requirement that at least 40 percent of apartments are at below-market rents.\nThe state law, first approved in 2023 and tweaked the subsequent two years, incentivizes inclusion of affordable and workforce rentals in projects by allowing developers to build bigger projects than zoning permits and granting them property tax breaks. Through the law, developers also can bypass public hearings and score approvals administratively.\nAffiliated bought The Dune site in 2024 for\n$12 million\n, according to records.\nThe firm, led by Jeff Burns and Nick Rojo, has about a dozen multifamily projects in South Florida. Its completed buildings include the 142-unit The Six13 in Fort Lauderdale, 200-unit\nBohemian\nand 230-unit MID in Lake Worth Beach, and 301-unit\nThe Grand\nin downtown West Palm Beach.\nAlso in Boynton Beach, Affiliated plans the 300-unit\nThe Pierce\nworkforce rentals project with 17,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space at Ocean Avenue and Federal Highway, near the intracoastal. Construction of The Pierce is expected to start this year, according to the release.\nDevelopers have seized on the Live Local Act with a flurry of project applications, with a few also scoring construction financing and starting to build their complexes.\nCoral Rock Development Group landed\n$54 million\nlast month to build the eight-story, 227-unit Dulce Vida Live Local Act apartment building in Miami\u2019s Allapattah. Developer Daniel Abreu scored a\n$16.5 million\nconstruction loan in 2024 for an 80-unit apartment building near North Miami.\nOnly a handful of Live Local projects have been completed since the law passed.\nAcross Florida, developers finished nearly 3,200 below-market rentals under the legislation in 23 projects, according to a Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute. The pipeline consists of\n43,400 units\nacross 143 projects that are in various stages from proposed to approved, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows.\n",

        "content": "Hollywood actor\nMickey Rourke is hoping to stay in his Los Angeles home with the help of crowdfunding.\n\u201cThe Wrestler\u201d star was served with a three-day notice of eviction from his Beverly Grove bungalow last month after his landlord, Eric Goldie, claimed he owes $59,100 in rent, the Hollywood Reporter\nreported\n. Recent court filings said Rourke failed to comply with the terms of that notice because \u201cno person of suitable age or discretion\u201d could be found at the home at 6520 Drexel Avenue, People and\nRealtor.com\nreported\n, though he was photographed outside the home on Jan. 1,\nper\nPage Six.\nIn the face of legal action from the landlord, Rourke approved the launch of a GoFundMe\npage\ncalled \u201cHelp Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home,\u201d which is being managed by Liya-Joelle Jones, a member of his management team.\n\u201cToday, Mickey is facing a very real and urgent situation: the threat of eviction from his home,\u201d the page reads. \u201cThis fundraiser is being created with Mickey\u2019s full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\u201c\nMickey Rourke\nis an icon \u2014 but his trajectory, as painful as it is, is also a deeply human one,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cIt is the story of someone who gave everything to his work, took real risks and paid real costs. Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability.\u201d\nRourke first\nstarted leasing\nthe 1926-built home in\nBeverly Grove\nin March last year at $5,200 per month. The rent was later raised to $7,000 per month. The landlord is asking a court to compel Rourke to pay both damages and legal fees.\nThe fundraiser has a goal of $100,000 and has raised more than $70,000 so far.\n\u201cMickey is going through a very difficult time right now, and it\u2019s been incredibly touching to see how many people care about him and want to help,\u201d Jones told the Hollywood Reporter of the influx of funds.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Now they\u2019ll have one more place to do it.\nNewly-inaugurated Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed an executive order mandating \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings in all five boroughs. The hearings invite tenants to complain about their landlords, as well as propose changes from the city.\n\u201cNew Yorkers know that too often, if they can find a home that they can afford, there is likely a reason they can afford it: Roaches and rats, heat that never turns on, elevators that are always out of order,\u201d the mayor said at a press conference focused on his housing efforts.\nMamdani\u2019s relationship with the real estate industry warmed toward the end of his campaign, as both sides realized they would need to work with one another. But the rental ripoff hearings stand to re-ignite the anger of the city\u2019s multifamily landlords.\nThe hearings will be organized by the city\u2019s new Mayor\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants, headed by former tenant advocate Cea Weaver, as well as the city\u2019s housing development, buildings, and consumer and worker protection departments. The order calls for every borough to have a hearing within the first 100 days of the Mamdani administration, with the hearings resulting in a joint summary and report.\nThe hearings will specifically concern, \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices,\u201d according to the order. The text refers to landlords and property managers as potential speakers, along with tenant organizations, advocates, and service providers.\nThe report is due no more than 90 days after the last hearing and should include a plan for the city to address \u201charmful landlord practices.\u201d Outcomes should focus on ensuring faster correction of housing violations and increased coordination among agencies and with the public.",

        "content": "In the final hours of the Adams administration, the incoming mayor was handed a win.\nOne of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 new appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board, Lliam Finn, decided against serving, leaving a vacancy for Zohran Mamdani to fill,\nThe Real Deal\nwas\nfirst to report\n.\nBefore leaving office, Adams tried to replace him with Christie Peale, head of the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit focused on affordable homeownership. Though Peale appeared briefly on the board\u2019s website over the weekend, she also turned down the role.\n\u201cIt was an honor to be selected to serve in a role of vital importance to so many New Yorkers, however, I decided it was not appropriate for my nomination to the Rent Guidelines Board to move forward at this time,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThe New York Daily News first\nreported\nthat Peale was up for Finn\u2019s seat.\nLast month Adams announced the appointment of\ntwo new members\nto the board: Finn, as a public representative, and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative. It\u2019s not clear when Finn rejected Adams\u2019 offer, but he did not go through the process of getting approval from his employer, Merrill Lynch, to serve on the board.\nAdams also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one. A representative for Mamdani didn\u2019t return requests seeking comment.\nThose appointments meant that in Mamdani\u2019s first year as mayor, a majority of the board\u2019s members would be Adams appointees. The move was viewed as an attempt to prevent\nMamdani\u2019s\ncampaign pledge to freeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants for four years.\nFinn\u2019s departure and Peale\u2019s rejection mean that Mamdani can replace as many as five members (including the chair) whenever he chooses, ensuring that his appointees make up a majority of the nine-person board. Next year, he can replace the four remaining members.\nAppointing a majority of the members doesn\u2019t guarantee a rent freeze. The board is supposed to be an independent body, though mayors have historically influenced its decisions.\nThe final day of the Adams administration proved to be an eventful one. Adams vetoed 19 bills, including the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA. He also tried to secure a last-minute\ndeal\nwith developers to drop their lawsuit related to their planned development at the Elizabeth Street Garden, but they\nrejected\nthe administration\u2019s offer.\nMeanwhile, Mamdani\u2019s first actions as mayor included\nintervening\nin a major bankruptcy case that will decide the fate of Pinnacle\u2019s rent-stabilized portfolio, relaunching the Office to Protect Tenants and announcing \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings for tenants to sound off on bad landlords.\n",

        "content": "Lenders made another billion-dollar bet on the Manhattan market office in November, the latest vote of confidence in the borough\u2019s top-tier towers. Deutsche Bank Center landed the month\u2019s\nmarquee deal\n, a $1.1 billion CMBS loan from German American Capital Corporation and Wells Fargo. The fully leased Lincoln Square office tower is owned by a joint venture that includes Related Companies and sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Deutsche Bank occupies more than 93 percent of the former Time Warner Center under a 20-year lease.\nElsewhere in the borough, lenders doled out dollars to apartments, specialty medical buildings and student housing. Vanbarton Group\u2019s Midtown South apartment tower, which recently absorbed former WeWork floors for residential use,\nlanded a $280 million loan\n. Aire, a 43-story Upper West Side rental tower owned by Gotham Organization and Carlyle,\nlanded a $260 million refinance\n. And Nordic Trustee provided $245 million for the New York Proton Center in East Harlem. Rounding out the month, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo backed a $167 million CMBS loan tied to a hotel-to-dorm conversion at 525 Lexington Avenue, part of a larger student housing package spanning New York and Boston.\nHere are more details.\nDeutsche Deal | $1.1B | Upper West Side\nGerman American Capital Corporation and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.1 billion CMBS loan for Deutsche Bank Center, owned by a joint venture that includes Related Companies and sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. The floating-rate, interest-only loan refinances existing debt on the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at 60 Columbus Circle and covers roughly two-thirds of its $1.65 billion appraised value, Bisnow\nreported\n. Deutsche Bank, which relocated its U.S. headquarters to the tower from Wall Street in 2021, occupies 93.5 percent of the building under a 20-year lease with an option to renew for another two decades. The property \u2013\nformerly\nthe Time Warner Center before the media giant decamped to Hudson Yards \u2013 is fully leased.\nFresh Aire | $260M | Upper West Side\nNatixis\nprovided a $260 million loan to refinance Aire, a 43-story Upper West Side apartment tower owned by a joint venture of Gotham Organization and the Carlyle Group. The refinancing at 200 West 67th Street will go toward apartment renovations, as well as updates to the amenities. Carlyle and Gotham snapped up the 310-unit building in 2024 for $265 million from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty, which was forced to sell after being unable to repay a $225 million CMBS loan due to the expiration of the 421a tax break. The fresh financing replaced a $216 million bridge loan from MF1 Capital.\nVanbarton bucks | $280M | Midtown South\nInvesco Real Estate\nprovided a $280 million loan to refinance Vanbarton Group\u2019s Sixth Avenue apartment tower, where the developer recently\nconverted several former WeWork office floors\ninto apartments. Vanbarton bought the property at 980 Sixth Avenue in 2018 for $316 million. The 25-story building, just north of Herald Square between West 36th and West 37th streets, already had 380 rental apartments above the former co-working space and retail on the ground floor. The new loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust.\nProton payday | $245M | East Harlem\nNordic Trustee\n, an Oslo-based bond trustee, provided a $245 million loan for the proton therapy center at 225 East 126th Street. The financing for the New York Proton Center, owned by an affiliate of Murphy &amp; McManus, replaced a $150 million loan from Nomura Holdings. Murphy &amp; McManus developed the 139,000-square-foot specialty medical building for a partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Montefiore Health System and Mount Sinai Health System, which leases the building. It opened in August 2019.\nDorm dollars | $167M | Midtown East\nGoldman Sachs and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $167 million CMBS loan for a hotel-dormitory owned by V\u00e4rde Partners and Hawkins Way Capital\u2019s hotel-to-dormitory conversion at 525 Lexington Avenue. The deal is part of a $431 million loan package for a three-building student housing portfolio in New York City and Boston, according to\nMorningstar\n. The two-year, interest-only note has three one-year extension options. Hawkins Way and V\u00e4rde purchased the shuttered Marriott\nin 2023\nfrom German investment firm Deka Immobilien\n$153.4 million\nfor the 655-key property \u2014 a little more than half the $270 million Deka paid for it in 2015. The 34-story building provides 1,355 beds for students from multiple New York City universities and colleges.\n",

        "content": "Tryperion Holdings paid $59 million for Mid America Plaza, a two-building office complex in Oakbrook Terrace near the intersection of Kingery Hwy and West 22nd Street, according to DuPage County property records and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The price is well below the $78 million that seller Equus Capital Partners shelled out for the property in 2016, before the office market fell into its current malaise.\nThe deal marks one of\nTryperion\u2019s\nmore visible entries into the Chicago-area office market, coming just months after the firm announced it had raised $163 million for its latest real estate investment and debt vehicle. The fund targets \u201csub-institutional\u201d assets that often fly under the radar of large institutions, according to the publication.\nAt the time,\nTryperion\nsaid it was actively bidding on office properties in gateway markets while keeping flexibility to invest across other property types. Fund IV drew capital from family offices tied to high-profile investors, including Oaktree Capital co-chairman Howard Marks, Apollo Global Management co-founder Tony Ressler, Moelis &amp; Co. CEO Ken Moelis and Panda Express founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng. The firm also cited an unnamed top-20 university endowment in the Southeast as an investor.\nTryperion financed its suburban Chicago buy with a $36.6 million loan from Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of Chicago-based CNA Financial, property records show.\nThe more than 413,000-square-foot\nMid America Plaza\nsits across from Oakbrook Center, one of the region\u2019s largest shopping malls. The complex hit the market in June and was 87 percent leased at the time, with a weighted average lease term of 6.5 years, according to marketing materials from JLL, which brokered the sale. The Oakbrook Terrace sale was brokered by JLL\u2019s Patrick Shields, Sam DiFrancesca, Jaime Fink and Bruce Miller.\nJLL pitched the offering as a chance to acquire a stable, well-leased office asset at a basis far below replacement cost. Newtown Square, Pennsylvania-based Equus had invested $17.7 million into the property since acquiring it, upgrading lobbies and common areas. Tenants including Graycor Services, BCS Financial and Mike Ditka\u2019s Restaurant renewed leases between 2021 and 2025, JLL said.\nTryperion founder and managing partner Jeffrey Karsh said in a statement to the outlet that the firm saw long-term value in entering the Chicago-area market below the replacement cost of the prior owner, calling the property a victim of the broader stigma hanging over the office sector.\nEquus, which is nearing the end of its planned hold period, said it is handing the asset off after a full 10-year investment cycle. The firm is still marketing another suburban Chicago office property \u2014 the Helmut Jahn-designed\nMetroWest\nbuilding in Naperville \u2014 where Newmark brokers were hired in October to seek a buyer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas County\u2019s $5 billion plans to construct a new jail could unlock one of the most prominent redevelopment sites in the city.\nCounty Judge Clay Jenkins said the county will begin moving forward in 2026 on a replacement for the Lew Sterrett Justice Center at 111 Commerce Street, citing severe overcrowding and the age of the facility, which was built nearly 50 years ago, according to an interview with\nWFAA\n.\nThe new jail is expected to cost north of $5 billion and could take nearly a decade to plan, approve and build.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just throw up a jail in nine months or a year,\u201d\nJenkins said\n, comparing the timeline to other major civic projects like the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center\noverhaul\n.\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions is\nlocation\n. What is clear, Jenkins said, is that the next jail will not sit between Dallas\u2019 two iconic Calatrava bridges, where the current complex occupies highly visible land along the Trinity River. State law requires the jail to remain within four miles of the county courthouse, narrowing the field but still leaving several potential sites in play.\nJenkins said the county expects to purchase land for the new facility later this year, a key step that would solidify plans and start the clock on what would be one of the region\u2019s largest public-sector developments in decades.\nThe relocation could be just as consequential as the jail itself, as vacating the current site would free up a large swath of prime riverfront land near downtown, a parcel that has already been floated as a potential site for a new arena for the\nDallas Mavericks\n, among other high-profile redevelopment concepts.\nThe jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\n\u201cIf you were building a jail now, you probably wouldn\u2019t build it right in the middle of the postcard, front door of Dallas,\u201d Jenkins told the outlet.\nJenkins emphasized that the new jail will be designed to emphasize mental health treatment and lower recidivism, an improvement from the current situation, which cycles inmates through an outdated facility.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Conversion fever is not going anywhere this year, with novice figures now jumping on board with established players.\nSamuel Fisch of Blue Fin Equities filed plans to convert 40 Fulton Street in the Financial District from office to residential use, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The 28-story building would be expanded by two stories and the residential unit count would come in at 169.\nFisch signed a ground lease for the property in 2022 for $88.9 million, taking control of the building\u2019s fate. Immediately before that, prominent investor David Werner bought the property from Vornado\nfor $101 million\n.\nFisch signed the ground lease with Fulton &amp; Pearl, an affiliate of Werner\u2019s. The ground lease and conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nFisch could not be reached for comment by the Observer.\nThe conversion at the corner of Fulton and Pearl streets will put between six and eight units on most of the floors; there will be ground-floor retail space and office space on a majority of the lowest six floors. There will also be amenities, including a fitness center, a lounge and coworking spaces.\nThough Werner handed the keys of this project to another player, the developer has been involved in prominent office-to-residential conversions in Manhattan in recent years.\nWerner and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management are\nconverting\n675 Third Avenue into a 464-unit residential building, including retail space. Werner acquired the site for $100 million and received a $90 million loan for the acquisition and predevelopment.\nThe two firms are also partners on another large-scale conversion at 235 East 42nd Street, expected to be completed in late 2027.\nIn the first eight months of 2025, more than 4 million square feet of office space in Manhattan had been converted to residential use, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, already exceeding the totals for each of the preceding two full years.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 68 days on the market, on average.\nTwenty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,282 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed eight contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $54.4 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the three single-family homes and four condos under contract last week totals $78.7 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of about $12 million and spent an average of 59 days on the market. They total nearly $36 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe\nSunset Islands\nhouse at 1800 West 27th Street in Miami Beach topped the report. Property records show Sun Light Sunset LLC, led by Jack Azout of\nElion Partners\n, Harry Jamri Alfassi, Jerry Lechter and others, owns the six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom house. The 5,700-square-foot home, on nearly a third of an acre, is asking just under $18 million with Compass\u2019 Chad Carroll. The LLC paid just $3.3 million for the property in 2021 and completed the new tropical modern home last year.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $10.7 million and spent 75 days on the market, on average. They total nearly $43 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,800 per square foot.\nA penthouse at the\nSt. Regis\n, at 9701 Collins Avenue in Bal Harbour, asking $14 million, topped the condo component of the report. The 3,900-square-foot unit with three bedrooms and four bathrooms is on the market with Douglas Elliman agent Devin Kay, asking $3,600 per square foot.\u00a0Last week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 13 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $113.4 million, and the typical home spent 345 days on the market.\n",

It should have appeared on the list twice.\nThe 280,000-square-foot office building at 11757 Katy Freeway, which\nfaced foreclosure\nearly last year, changed hands again in the last week of 2025.\nGemini Rosemont handed over keys to the Energy Corridor building in March to Apollo Global Management after defaulting on a $30.9 million loan from Voya Insurance. David Z. Mafrige Interests, a Houston-based firm that redevelops office and retail, purchased Kirkwood Tower from Apollo in December, according to a release from Stream Realty, which represented the buyer and handles leasing at the property.\nIn conjunction with the ownership change, Stream completed 150,000 square feet of lease transactions, bringing the building\u2019s occupancy to 76 percent, it said in a release.\nThe 15-story office property sheathed in black glass was built in 1984 and renovated in 2015. The building is located along Interstate 10, about 17 miles west of downtown, in Houston\u2019s Energy Corridor, which has become a popular office destination.\nThe availability rate in Houston\u2019s office market was a tick over 26 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2025, according to the Greater Houston Partnership. Office availability peaked at the end of 2022 at a little more than 28 percent.\nThe flight to quality trend continues to tell the story of the Houston office market, with buildings completed in the last 15 years averaging under 15 percent vacancy while older buildings have, on average, nearly 28 percent vacancy, the report said.Houston\u2019s Energy Corridor has become a resilient pocket of Houston\u2019s struggling office market. The submarket saw a slew of leases in 2025, including SM Energy, which\ndoubled its space at Granite Properties\u2019 Eldridge One\n, at 777 North Eldridge Parkway, and\nKansas engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch\n, which landed $5 million in improvement dollars when it signed a lease for nearly 41,000 square feet of Mac Haik\u2019s Energy Tower II at 11720 Katy Freeway.\n",

        "content": "Dallas County\u2019s $5 billion plans to construct a new jail could unlock one of the most prominent redevelopment sites in the city.\nCounty Judge Clay Jenkins said the county will begin moving forward in 2026 on a replacement for the Lew Sterrett Justice Center at 111 Commerce Street, citing severe overcrowding and the age of the facility, which was built nearly 50 years ago, according to an interview with\nWFAA\n.\nThe new jail is expected to cost north of $5 billion and could take nearly a decade to plan, approve and build.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just throw up a jail in nine months or a year,\u201d\nJenkins said\n, comparing the timeline to other major civic projects like the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center\noverhaul\n.\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions is\nlocation\n. What is clear, Jenkins said, is that the next jail will not sit between Dallas\u2019 two iconic Calatrava bridges, where the current complex occupies highly visible land along the Trinity River. State law requires the jail to remain within four miles of the county courthouse, narrowing the field but still leaving several potential sites in play.\nJenkins said the county expects to purchase land for the new facility later this year, a key step that would solidify plans and start the clock on what would be one of the region\u2019s largest public-sector developments in decades.\nThe relocation could be just as consequential as the jail itself, as vacating the current site would free up a large swath of prime riverfront land near downtown, a parcel that has already been floated as a potential site for a new arena for the\nDallas Mavericks\n, among other high-profile redevelopment concepts.\nThe jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\n\u201cIf you were building a jail now, you probably wouldn\u2019t build it right in the middle of the postcard, front door of Dallas,\u201d Jenkins told the outlet.\nJenkins emphasized that the new jail will be designed to emphasize mental health treatment and lower recidivism, an improvement from the current situation, which cycles inmates through an outdated facility.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A Newmark team led by Adam Spies arranged the sale.\nThe deal is the latest sign of strength for Manhattan\u2019s office market, which for 2025 is expected to record its best year since 2019 as companies brought their employees back to the office in full force.\nSL Green has taken notice of the demand; at its investor conference last month the company said it plans to sell $2.5 billion worth of property, in part to help offset higher interest rates.\nThe REIT is \u201cselling assets [and] losing [income] to fight against interest rates that are too high,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Matthew DiLiberto said at the conference.\nSL Green also intends to be busy on the buy side, with about $1 billion worth of acquisitions planned for 2026.\nBoston-based Rockpoint, led by co-CEOs Tom Gilbane and Aric Shalev, recently inked a deal to sell its 50-story One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza tower to David Werner for $270 million.\n",

        "content": "A struggling mall outside of Chicago could be headed for a comeback.\nChicago-based commercial real estate firm Xroads Real Estate Advisors bought Lincolnwood Town Center this week for $12.3 million, completing a massive dropoff for a property dragged through a lengthy and costly\nforeclosure process\n.\nThe 31 acre property at 3333 West Touhy Avenue and McCormick Boulevard was previously owned by Washington Prime Group before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2022. The last loan on the property was issued in 2014 for $52.8 million, signaling a staggering loss in value over the past decade.\nEventually, Keybank took over the property before selling it to Xroads. The loan became the subject of a nearly $50 million foreclosure lawsuit in 2021. The new owner plans to work with the Village of Lincolnwood to \u201cre-imagine what this site can become,\u201d Xroads President Kirsten Bowersox said.\nThe move comes not long after the village of Lincolnwood considered taking over the site via\neminent domain\nas a last-ditch effort to bring the faltering mall back to life. But now the town has an easier path ahead that avoids\nthe legal\nchallenges of pursuing a takeover of the property\u2019s ownership.\nA redevelopment blueprint, the \u201cLincolnwood Town Center Concept Plan,\u201d was adopted by the Village Board in 2022, laying out mixed-use scenarios that include apartments, offices and entertainment.\nMall giant Simon Properties developed the mall over 30 years ago. Former Simon subsidiary Washington Prime became the sole owner of the property in 2014 when Simon spun off Washington Prime and it became an independent public company.\nLincolnwood Town Center was once dubbed \u201cthe largest redevelopment opportunity within Chicago\u2019s inner-ring suburbs,\u201d by Chicago\u2019s local NBC affiliate. The mall has cycled through owners and foreclosure proceedings for years. JLL was tapped to market it for sale in 2022.\nLincolnwood Town Center has long been a casualty of suburban malls\u2019 slow-motion collapse. Its largest anchor, Carson\u2019s, shuttered in 2018, and got replaced by RoomPlace, which has 84,000 square feet.\nToday, Kohl\u2019s is the main draw with a footprint of 102,000 square feet, alongside about three dozen smaller tenants, but swaths of space sit empty. The mall was 81 percent occupied as of the fall of 2025.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials pitched the 423,000-square-foot center as a \u201c1990 vintage property\u201d ripe for repositioning. The firm highlights Lincolnwood\u2019s support for a new owner, existing lease structures and the potential to introduce multifamily, office and service retail to the site.\nThe recent sale also comes as other large Chicagoland malls have\nundergone major renovations or redevelopment\nand new\ninvestments in suburban shopping centers\nthat are primed for upgrades in the Chicago area are picking up.\nAt least one shopping center in the Chicago area has bucked the trend of suburban shopping malls taking a nosedive.\nBrookfield Properties\u2019 Oakbrook Center in Oakbrook\nhas seen a slew of new retailers\nas property values in the area reach new heights.\n",

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat Metrick, a nearly 30-year company veteran, led Saks through its $2.7 billion acquisition of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus Group in 2024.\nBaker\nwill guide what Saks called the company\u2019s ongoing transformation.\nThe change comes days after Saks missed an interest payment of more than $100 million tied to debt from the Neiman Marcus deal, the Wall Street Journal first reported. The lapse has fueled expectations of an imminent Chapter 11 filing or asset sales as the company grapples with heavy leverage, soft luxury demand and a tough retail environment.\nThe uncertainty lands squarely on Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, the storied retailer whose real estate has already been in flux. Early in 2025 Saks announced plans to close Neiman\u2019s flagship store at 1618 Main Street, then repeatedly delayed the move after pushback from\ncity leaders\n, stating it would remain open beyond the 2025 holiday season as talks continue with the city on a potential reimagining of the nine-story property.\nThe fate of the historic downtown anchor remains unresolved, with possibilities ranging from a continued retail presence to a reimagining as a mixed-use destination or conversion to apartments or a hotel.\nDowntown Dallas Incorporated CEO Jennifer Scripps told the publication last week that negotiations with the city on an economic development package are ongoing but unresolved.\nOther Neiman properties have already changed hands. The retailer recently sold its Beverly Hills store at 9700 Wilshire Boulevard, which it occupied since 1979, while continuing to operate there, the Los Angeles Times reported. In North Texas, Neiman sold its three-level store at The Shops at Willow Bend in\nPlano\nas the mall undergoes a major redevelopment.\nEarlier this year, Saks also disclosed plans to shutter Neiman\u2019s headquarters at\nCityplace Tower\nin Dallas after just two years. Owner NexPoint initially contested the move before pivoting to a $445 million redevelopment that includes residential and hotel components.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

On his first day in office, Mamdani signed executive orders that created interagency task forces to study two issues that were also the focus of previous task forces created during the Adams administration.\nOne is dubbed the Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development, or SPEED, task force. That group aims to identify policies and procedures that \u201caffect the timely production and availability of affordable housing, including such policies and procedures affecting pre- and post-construction approvals, project financing, and project marketing,\u201d and propose ways to expedite affordable housing construction.\nThat\u2019s similar to the goals of the\nBuilding and Land Use Approval Streamlining Taskforce\n, or BLAST, which was launched during the Adams administration and took some liberties with spelling and letter inclusion to make BLAST work.\nA separate executive order creates the Land Inventory Fast Track, or LIFT, task force, which will identify city-owned or -controlled properties where housing can be built. Adams signed a similar executive order in 2024 and launched the \u201c24 in \u201824\u201d initiative to advance 24 projects on city sites that year.\nIt remains to be seen how these new task forces will build on the findings of those previous groups.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related issues will you be looking for in Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s State of the State address? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fiorello La Guardia was the first New York City mayor to call Gracie Mansion\nhome\n. He preferred to call it the Mayor\u2019s House or Gracie Farm because \u201cmansion was a little rich for his taste,\u201d according to a 1979 New York Times story.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 During the first year of congestion pricing, 27 million fewer vehicles entered Manhattan below 60th Street,\nGothamist reports\n. Compared to the previous year, when congestion pricing was not in effect, that area saw an 11 percent reduction in daily traffic, on average.\n\u2014 The Queens Democratic Party on Monday endorsed Diana Moreno ahead of the Feb. 3 special election for Zohran Mamdani\u2019s former Assembly seat,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Moreno has also been endorsed by Mamdani and the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\u2014 Mamdani signed two executive orders on Monday to ramp up enforcement against businesses that trick consumers into paying hidden \u201cjunk fees\u201d and those that have misleading subscription services (including free trials that automatically convert into paid subscriptions \u201cwith critical disclosures buried in fine print or behind hyper links\u201d).\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$4.4 million\nfor 75 1/2 Bedford Street. The West Village townhouse is 1,000 square feet and last sold on the market for $3.4 million in 2023.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$52.9 million\nfor a portfolio of buildings in Rego Park. The properties include 94-14 63rd Drive, 95-38 Queens Boulevard, 63-79 Saunders Street, 95-40 Queens Boulevard, 95-60 63rd Drive, 96-44 Queens Boulevard and two retail properties at 95-05 and 95-02 63rd Drive. The total square footage of all addresses exceeds 60,000. The buyer was the Malachite Group, and the seller was Imperial Sterling Corp.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $12.5 million for a co-op unit at 1107 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op is listed by\nColdwell Banker Warburg\u2019s\nBonnie Chajet and Lisa Ellen Chajet.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 90,355-square-foot, 11-story, mixed-use building at 270 West 135th Street in Harlem. Tahir Demircioglu Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

The three-bedroom home measures just under 1,000 square feet. The deal works out to $4,400 per square foot. The buyer was\nUnderlake LLC\n. Hammer purchased the property in 2023 for $3.4 million. It has three bedrooms, 150 square feet of outdoor space and a private garden. The 19th-century home has had a host of famous residents, including Cary Grant, John Barrymore and Edna St. Vincent Millay, after whom the house is named. It went on the market with an asking price of $4.2 million in November.\nCortnee Glasser\nwith Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was in Rego Park, where a portfolio of commercial buildings sold for $52.9 million. The seller was\nImperial Sterling Corp.\nand the buyer was Mineola, New York-based\nMalachite Group\n, which recently acquired another Imperial property for\n$13.1 million\n. The properties are: a 9,500-square-foot retail building at\n94-14 63rd Drive\n; a 4,000-square-foot office building at\n95-38 Queens Boulevard\n; a 4,000-square-foot store at\n63-79 Saunders Street\n; a 7,700-square-foot store at\n95-40 Queens Boulevard\n; a 13,000-square-foot store at\n95-60 63rd Drive\n; a 21,000-square-foot store at\n96-44 Queens Boulevard\n; and two more retail properties at\n95-05 and 95-02 63rd Drive\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial: Related Companies\nand\nOxford Properties Group\ndropped $52 million on a parcel at\n463 10th Avenue\n, which will be part of its under-construction office tower at 70 Hudson Yards. The seller was an LLC tied to\nSoheil Khayyam\nthat had owned the site for decades. Related and Oxford announced that the firms also secured $2.45 billion in financing for the 1.4-million-square-foot office tower, which will be Deloitte\u2019s new U.S. headquarters. The financing, led by Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Standard Chartered, includes a $1.6 billion construction loan.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to Great Neck-based\nNamdar Realty Group\nand\nKlosed Properties\npurchased a commercial condo at Essex Crossing\u2019s\n140 Essex Street\n, a newly built senior housing complex, for $7.6 million from an LLC tied to\nSettlement Housing Fund\nand Essex Crossing\u2019s sponsors, which include\nTaconic Investment Partners\n. The unit spans about 10,200 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $745 per square foot. It is fully occupied and has about 140 feet of frontage along Essex Street, according to Klosed.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Gramercy Park,\nDr. Nina Vincoff\n, a radiologist, and\nGary Vincoff\noffloaded a condo at\n200 East 21st Street\nfor $4.2 million.

The unit\u2019s new owners are\nMin Ji Song\nand\nYunqi Zhang.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nDavid Eskander\nand\nNoble Black\nrepresented the sellers in the latest deal, which pencils out to about $2,300 per square foot.\nBy the Numbers:\nHome mortgage firms led REIT performance in 2025\nAmong public real estate investment trusts, mortgage firms won 2025.\nThe FTSE Nareit Mortgage REITs Index, which covers 32 public REITs, ended last year up 16 percent, according to Nareit, a REIT industry organization.\nResidential mortgages fueled the rise, likely buoyed by three interest-rate cuts at the back end of the year. For instance, one mortgage REIT, New York-based MFA Financial, saw its total returns rise by nearly 6 percent last year. Overall, the total returns for mortgage REITs were up by more than 26 percent for the year, according to Nareit.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "The law firm representing embattled developer Meyer Chetrit wants out.\nBaron Samson has accused members of the Chetrit family of failing to cooperate with counsel and not paying legal bills, with the law firm allegedly no longer able to trust information from its clients.\nIt\u2019s unusual to see these sorts of public accusations from an attorney about their client, but nothing about Chetrit\u2019s past year has been typical. The developer is battling a $132 million judgement owed to an entity of Maverick Real Estate Partners after a foreclosure case, as well as criminal charges of tenant harassment.\n\u201c[P]romises of cooperation were made and broken many times over the months,\u201d attorney Elliott Joffe wrote in a legal affirmation to support his firm\u2019s effort to withdraw as Chetrit\u2019s attorney in several cases. \u201cI do not fully understand the difficulties.\u201d\nJoffe said recent communications with the Chetrits had also raised questions about \u201cpotential conflicts of interest\u201d between Meyer and brother Joseph Chetrit, who both head The Chetrit Group.\nJoffe has represented Meyer Chetrit in litigation tied to the Maverick foreclosure and in a separate matter involving Mack Real Estate Group. In the affirmation he said he also had frequent contact with Joseph Chetrit and the Chetrit Group staff.\nBut Joffe allegedly ran into issues \u201calmost immediately\u201d getting his clients to cooperate.\n\u201c[S]ome of my requests for information and cooperation remained unfulfilled for months after I first made them despite repetition and promises of compliance,\u201d Joffe wrote in the affirmation. That resulted in missed deadlines and, in some cases, contempt applications. And at the same time, the Chetrit\u2019s expectations of his services grew, he said, creating an \u201cexplosion of additional work.\u201d\nAs the work snowballed, payment stopped, Joffe alleges. Baron Samson\u2019s most recent invoice is so far unpaid with a significant amount due, according to the affirmation. The firm\u2019s retainer deposit has been depleted and not replenished.\nThose factors have all led to a \u201cdeteriorating relationship\u201d between the Chetrits and the firm.\n\u201cInteractions which were once cordial have become contentious, to say the least,\u201d Joffe wrote.\nFinally, the affirmation refers somewhat opaquely to potential conflicts of interest between brothers Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, with Joffe referring to attorney client privilege as to why he couldn\u2019t say more.\n\u201c[W]e have become concerned that these conflicts, if genuine, could impair our ability to represent either or both effectively,\u201d the affirmation reads. \u201cIndeed, it may be that these conflicts are responsible for some or all of the lack of cooperation we have received.\u201d\nJoffe does not appear to have represented Joseph Chetrit in any suit specifically, and Joseph is not named as a defendant in the cases related to Maverick or Mack.\nJoffe did not respond to a request for further comment. His affirmation was posted briefly on the court\u2019s portal, but then returned for correction.",

        "content": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani came out swinging against \u201cbad landlords\u201d shortly after taking office.\nThe new mayor\u2019s first actions included naming a frequent adversary of city landlords to an office dedicated to tenant rights. He also announced that the city will \u201cintervene\u201d in a bankruptcy case that will decide the fate of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments.\nDuring Mamdani\u2019s first 100 days in office, the administration will host\nhearings\nfor tenants to sound off about their landlords and living conditions, dubbed \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings.\nThese actions underscore a point the mayor made during his inauguration address, that he will not moderate or scale back on pledges he made while campaigning for mayor. He reiterated his promise to freeze rents and to \u201ctake on the bad landlords who mistreat their tenants.\u201d\n\u201cI was elected as a Democratic socialist and I will govern as a Democratic socialist,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical.\u201d\nReal estate professionals are closely watching the first days of the administration unfold. Seth Glasser, a multifamily broker with Marcus &amp; Millichap, wasn\u2019t surprised by Mamdani\u2019s first moves as mayor.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just wake up today and think \u2018this guy doesn\u2019t like landlords,\u2019\u201d he said.\nHe noted that the city\u2019s involvement in Pinnacle Group\u2019s\nbankruptcy case\ncould create uncertainty around how the government will intervene in private deals going forward, which could scare away investors and lenders.\n\u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t underwrite is government intervention,\u201d he said.\nOn his first day in office, Mamdani signed three housing-related executive orders. One relaunched the\ndefunct\nOffice to Protect Tenants, giving it a more specific mandate than its predecessor to \u201cpromote tenants\u2019 interests and concerns\u201d and develop \u201cpolicy changes to strengthen tenants\u2019 rights.\u201d The order also leaves the door open for the mayor to assign the office more responsibility.\nHe named tenant organizer\nCea Weaver\nas the director of the Office to Protect Tenants. Weaver, who heads tenant advocacy groups Housing Justice for All and the New York State Tenant Bloc and was a policy advisor to Mamdani during his campaign, played a major role in the passage of the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act, which closed off most ways that landlords can increase rents on stabilized apartments.\nJoanne Grell, a rent-stabilized tenant and co-chair of the NYS Tenant Bloc\u2019s rent freeze campaign, said in a statement that Weaver\u2019s appointment \u201cmakes clear that Mayor Mamdani is serious about following through on his commitment to protect tenants.\u201d\nOne of the office\u2019s first actions was to\nintervene\nin Pinnacle Group\u2019s bankruptcy and the Jan. 8 auction that would transfer 5,100 rent-stabilized apartments in the owner\u2019s portfolio. As of Monday, the city hasn\u2019t filed anything in federal court, but Weaver told the New York Times that the goal is to ensure that the new owner pursues repairs and complies with rent-stabilization laws.\nKenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said he is not against the city helping Pinnacle\u2019s tenants organize to buy the building, but doing so would cost millions of dollars. He also said taking such action should come with the recognition that there are many other rent-stabilized buildings in similar situations and that broader action is needed to help struggling owners.\nThe mayor signed an executive order directing the Office to Protect Tenants, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Buildings and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to host \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings. The hearings will focus on \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices\u201d as well as \u201coperational improvements that the City should adopt to strengthen housing and building code enforcement.\u201d\nThe order indicates that the city wants to hear from landlords in addition to tenants, tenant advocacy groups and others.\n\u201cI want New Yorkers who have long been ignored by their landlords to finally be heard by our city government,\u201d Mamdani said during a press conference announcing the hearings, noting that the hearings won\u2019t simply be \u201clistening sessions\u201d but will help shape policy.\nWithin 90 days of the final hearing, the city agencies must issue a report detailing common issues raised and a plan for addressing them.\nBurgos described the hearings as \u201cperformative\u201d and in service of justifying the mayor\u2019s campaign promises.\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly trying to build a narrative for a rent freeze,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data is not going to support a rent freeze, and he knows that, so he needs to create a public campaign of vibes instead of real numbers.\u201d\nMamdani also signed orders that continued initiatives started under the Adams administration. One such order creates a task force to study ways to speed up affordable housing construction, similar to the goals of one\nlaunched\nby the Adams administration. Another task force will identify city-owned or controlled sites where housing can be built. Adams\nissued\na similar order in 2024.\n",

        "content": "Mack Real Estate Group took control of a Hudson Yards development site long tied up in litigation with the Chetrit Group.\nMack closed on a $94 million title transfer for a vacant parcel at 545 West 37th Street, PincusCo\nreported\n. Mack acquired the site from a Chetrit affiliate in a deal that closed Dec. 18 and was recorded Jan. 2.\nThe transaction values the site at about $543 per buildable square foot, based on 172,00 square feet of unused development rights and no existing built space.\nMack and Chetrit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe transaction caps a years-long unraveling of Chetrit\u2019s plans for the site, which sits just west of Hudson Yards proper. Chetrit bought the parcel in 2012 for $26.5 million and later filed plans for a 131-unit, 373,000-square-foot hotel, a project permitted in late 2021. But construction never moved forward and there have been no permit filings since 2022.\nInstead, the property became the subject of courtroom drama.\nThree years ago, Chetrit\ndefaulted\non an $85 million loan tied to the property. The debt \u2014 a $53.7 million senior loan and $31.3 million mezzanine loan \u2014\nwas issued in 2018\nby JPMorgan Chase and Mack, the latter of which became the sole owner of the debt, collateralized by the full equity interest in the site.\nMack won a judgment tied to an $18.5 million loan connected to the site last year. The firm also pursued a carry guarantee suit \u2014 related to guarantors\u2019 funding shortfalls \u2014 that remains technically active, though court records show no filings since October.\nIn the\nsummer\n, two lenders, including Mack, argued that Meyer Chetrit\u2019s maneuvers around a $21.7 million debt to his late brother Jacob\u2019s estate were an attempt to hide assets from creditors.\nMack and Maverick Financial are trying to recover $220 million and $132 million, respectively, from Meyer.\nBack to the site itself, the 17,000-square-foot lot is zoned for commercial or residential development with inclusionary housing. City records pegged its market value at $14.6 million in 2022.\nFor Mack, the takeover adds another development opportunity to a portfolio skewed towards hospitality. Roughly a quarter of the firm\u2019s New York City square footage is in hotels, according to PincusCo.\nFor Chetrit, the transfer trims a portfolio that still spans nearly 40 city properties with more than $1.6 billion in debt. The firm has not bought any New York City assets in the past two years, per PincusCo.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The apartment last traded in 2022 to an anonymous buyer for just over $20 million. It hit the market again a year ago with a $27 million price tag.\nThe 3,400-square-foot condo has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. It also features a home theater and a terrace with a pool.\nThe second most expensive property to enter contract was Unit 16B, with an asking price of $21.5 million. The condo was purchased by a Thailand-based investor for $20.7 million in August 2024 and hit the market again roughly six months later.\nAmie Buchanan, who led the in-house sales team at the project, had both listings.\nAnother 18th-floor unit at the building topped the borough\u2019s luxury market in December when it found a buyer with an asking price just under\n$30 million\n. The seller bought the apartment from the developer for $35 million in 2022.\nThe building nabbed its\nfirst resale\nin July 2024, four years after the developer launched sales of the 22 units atop the historic Crown Building. Unit 23A traded for $64 million, up from the $51 million the seller paid for it earlier that year.\nOf the 13 properties to find buyers, six were condos, three were co-ops, one was a condop and three were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $113 million, which works out to an average of $8.7 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home was on the market for less than a year and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

        "content": "The developers planning a 60-home neighborhood in\nGlenview\ntook over the site in December after village leaders gave it final approval.\nHighland Park-based Generation 4, led by\nKeith Jacobs, formerly of the Jacobs Companies\n, and Red Seal Homes \u2014 a Nashville-based firm with an office in Northbrook \u2014 purchased the 19.4-acre former Scott Foresman site at 1900 East Lake Avenue in Glenview for $14 million in December, according to property records. Chicago-based investment firm R2 was the seller.\nIn a joint venture with Wheaton-based T2 Capital Management, R2 purchased the site for $10.7 million in 2022 after the previous owners faced foreclosure, property records show. The now-vacant building on the lot was previously operated by Scott Foresman, a publisher of school textbooks.\nSales for the 60 lots on the site are already in progress, with prices ranging from $399,900 to $725,000. KC Kaage, a Compass agent whose team Kaage Homes is leading sales of the lots, said 24 of the 60 lots are currently under contract.\nFor most of the lots, buyers will be able to work with designers and builders to build custom homes, Kaage said. The developers will build a few spec houses on the land, with Kaage Homes leading design, he said.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for people to customize their home to their tastes, to their liking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey control the budget, and it provides a unique opportunity that hasn\u2019t been seen in several decades here in Glenview.\u201d\nRed Seal Homes did not respond to requests for comment, and Jacobs declined to comment.\nMatt Garrison, CEO of R2, said the firm expected to flip the site into a residential development since it took it over. R2\nput the site on the market\nin 2023 after a\nprevious developer\u2019s proposal\nto turn the site into rental housing got rejected. Garrison said there was interest from buyers for other uses, but residential was the best fit.\n\u201cIn this case, with a 20 acre land site near downtown Glenview, it was clear from day one that this was likely a residential development site,\u201d he said.\nThe development, which was pitched as primarily marketed to empty-nesters, gained final village approval in December. Throughout the permitting process, the Glenview Village Board of Trustees wanted to ensure the lots were purchased by empty-nesters and limit the number of new school-aged children the development would add to the local district.\nThe village is requiring 75 percent of the homes built on the site to be ranch-style or have the primary bedroom on the first floor, according to city documents, in an attempt to appeal to the cohort.\nKaage said he could not share the demographics of the people under contract for the lots. The village\u2019s preferences for the first-floor bedrooms has \u201cproven to be very attractive to the market, given the lack of inventory right now,\u201d he said.\nThe developers plan to begin interior demolition on the vacant building in the next two weeks, Kaage said, and exterior demolition will begin in February. The building contains a time capsule installed by the education company, which the developers plan to hand over to the village, Kaage said.\nAfter demolition, the developers will begin preparing the lots by building utilities, roads and other infrastructure, Kaage said. He is expecting lots to be handed over to buyers by late spring.\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay is continuing to unwind its North Side land holdings tied to the ill-fated Lincoln Yards megaproject, selling another development site near the formerly envisioned campus.\nAn affiliate of Calgary, Alberta-based Jack Carter Automotive Group paid $15.5 million last month for two neighboring parcels at 1642 North Besly Court and 1400 West North Avenue, according to Cook County property records. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthe buyer acquired the properties from a Sterling Bay venture that had assembled the sites more than seven years ago as part of its push to control land around Lincoln Yards.\nThe deal further shrinks Sterling Bay\u2019s\npresence\nin the stretch between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, where the Chicago-based developer once pitched a $6 billion, 53-acre mixed-use district spanning roughly 14.5 million square feet. After struggling to secure financing and land anchor tenants, Sterling Bay surrendered much of the Lincoln Yards site to its lender early last year and is now finalizing a deal to sell most of its remaining interest in the project to\nNovak Construction\n.\nAs the megaproject faded, Sterling Bay has been steadily offloading nearby properties it once viewed as strategic. In 2023, the firm sold a 122,000-square-foot industrial building at 1854 North Besly Court, just a few blocks north of the parcels that traded last month.\nPublic records show Sterling Bay acquired the North Avenue and Besly Court sites in separate deals in 2017 and 2018 for a combined $13.8 million, part of a broader land-grab aimed at giving the firm flexibility to expand or reshape Lincoln Yards if the vision took hold. At the time, Sterling Bay was aggressively buying up industrial and commercial properties throughout the corridor.\nOne of the parcels, at 1400 West North Avenue, had been teed up for redevelopment. Sterling Bay previously proposed a roughly 100,000-square-foot medical office building at the site, with marketing materials highlighting its visibility along the Kennedy Expressway and proximity to the planned Lincoln Yards\ncampus\n.\nThe\nproperties\ninclude vacant land, a surface parking lot and an industrial building. The area has become a hub for luxury auto retailers, with dealerships for Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Acura and Lexus clustered nearby. The North Avenue site was formerly home to Nortown Automotive, which has since relocated a few blocks east.\nBoth Sterling Bay and the Jack Carter Automotive Group did not respond to requests for comment from the publication. The company operates multiple auto dealerships, power sports outlets and a bicycle store across Canada.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The University of California, San Francisco, is continuing its Bay Area expansion with a 280,000-square-foot lease in South San Francisco.\nUCSF Health signed on to be an anchor tenant at Kilroy Realty Corporation\u2019s Kilroy Oyster Point, taking up one of three buildings that are part of the roughly 875,000-square-foot second phase of the project completed last year, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The deal marks the largest one signed at the\nOyster Point development\nsince 2019 when Stripe took about 420,000 square feet in the project\u2019s first phase.\nTerms of the lease, including rent price, were not disclosed. The agreement is set to last 16 and a half years.\nUCSF Health will move its pharmacy and clinical laboratory groups from their hospital campuses to the new Kilroy space at 369 Oyster Point Boulevard, Brian Newman, chief of real estate at UCSF, told the Business Times. The university will open the new facility in early 2029.\nThe San Francisco university has been in expansion mode across the Bay Area over the past two years. In September 2024, the University of California Board of Regents approved a plan to build a 300,000-square-foot cancer center at Fifth Space\u2019s\nPower Station development\nin San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. It\nbegan construction\non the nearly $500 million project last year.\nLast month, the university\npurchased two buildings in Mission Bay\nfrom\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\nfor $767 million. UCSF\u2019s School of Dentistry will relocate to 409 Illinois Street, as the school plans to turn the approximately 280,000-square-foot building into dental clinics and a 60,000-square-foot education center for students enrolled in the university\u2019s dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and physical therapy programs. Work is expected to kick off this year and finish in 2029. The school already occupies the adjacent 499 Illinois Street building.\nKilroy began work on the second phase of Kilroy Oyster Point in 2021. As of the third quarter of last year, prior to UCSF\u2019s new deal, the company inked 84,000 square feet in new leases.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A show trial is \u201cheld in public with the intention of influencing or satisfying public opinion, rather than of ensuring justice,\u201d according to Oxford.\nThat sounds like what Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u201c\nrental ripoff\n\u201d hearings will be. His executive order asks tenants and activists to testify about \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t call for testimony about unfair,\nabusive\nor\nunconscionable\npractices by tenants, although landlords have lots of\nhorror stories\n. His order doesn\u2019t request facts about how laws and economic forces have made maintaining rent-stabilized housing so\nchallenging\n.\nNo, these hearings are only for landlord shaming.\nNew York City has thousands of landlords. Of course some are\nbad apples\n. In a functional housing market, with ample housing supply and no rent regulation, bad landlords would go out of business because tenants would move.\nBut Mamdani favors price controls, where tenants stay with a bad landlord because the rent is kept artificially low \u2014 as is the vacancy rate, so tenants can\u2019t easily move.\nInstead of normalcy, where landlords and tenants try to make each other happy, our system relies on enforcement, which is always going to fall short. This will be a recurring narrative at the \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings.\nBut is it fair to call them show trials? How do we know that \u201censuring justice\u201d isn\u2019t the aim of these hearings?\nFor one thing, no one will be fact-checking, rebutting or even questioning any testimony. For an example of how this might go, at Mamdani\u2019s press conference announcing the hearings, tenant activist Fitzroy Christian complained about being charged for scratching the floors of his rent-stabilized apartment.\n\u201cWhen I want to clean under my bed, and I want to clean under my couch, and I want to clean behind my dressers, I have to pull them away. When they scratch the floors, the landlord says I damaged the floors, and I get billed for damages. And that becomes a permanent part of my rent.\u201d\nAt a real trial, a lawyer might ask Christian these questions:\nWho should pay to repair floors damaged by a tenant?\nWhat other damages caused by tenants should they not have to pay for?\nHow does a fee for scratching your floors become a permanent part of your rent?\nIf you must move furniture, why not buy\nsliders for $5.99\n?\nWho is really damaging apartments \u2014 neat freaks who clean under sofas and beds? Or troubled tenants who punch holes in walls, clog pipes and\nabuse dogs\n?\nChristian also cited\na report\npublished \u201cnot too long ago\u201d about fees that make affordable housing unaffordable. The report was published in 2013.\nA lot has changed since. The Rent Guidelines Board kept rent increases below the rate of inflation for\n10 consecutive years\n. The 2019 rent law eliminated the 20 percent vacancy bonus and essentially banned renovations.\nInsurance premiums\nsoared,\nwater rates\njumped and property taxes kept going up. Some tenants\nstopped paying rent\nand it became\nextremely difficult\nto evict them.\nUnable to boost revenue to match these cost increases, landlords cut back on maintenance. It will be impossible at Mamdani\u2019s \u201cripoff\u201d hearings to tell which landlords ignored violations because of malice or because of math.\nIncidentally, Mamdani\u2019s order says landlords can speak at his hearings. But that is kind of like inviting sheep to a gathering of wolves. I highly doubt Bronx landlord Les Lerner will testify about how tenants game the system, as he explained last year to\nThe Real Deal\n:\n\u201cHPD has designed a system that\nallows tenants to weaponize violations\n, and housing court has designed a system whereby violations and repairs prevent non-payment cases from advancing. This is all an orchestrated scheme to prevent evictions.\u201d\nLandlords will surely be hammered at the mayor\u2019s show trials. But should they be worried about anything besides being portrayed as demons? Yes.\nShow trials are not just to let people vent. They aim to grease the skids so some action can be taken without anyone stopping it.\nBoth parties practice political theater. When Mamdani was in grade school, congressional Republicans held hearings to publicize fabricated or exaggerated IRS abuses, after which they slashed the agency\u2019s budget. About one of every six dollars owed in federal taxes now goes\nuncollected\n.\nThe worst show trials, such as in Communist China or Stalin\u2019s Russia, result in executions. Mamdani is not in that realm of evil, but he likely plans something.\nA probable goal is to enact\nCOPA\nor otherwise transfer ownership of distressed buildings to mission-driven nonprofits. Never mind that these organizations \u2014 and the Housing Authority \u2014 are\nstruggling\nto maintain their own rental buildings, despite not having to pay property taxes.\nAt the very least, by turning public opinion even further against landlords, the hearings will make it harder to launch programs or pass laws that help them pay for repairs.\nA key question is how much power tenant activist\nCea Weaver\n\u2014 whom Mamdani put in charge of a revamped\nOffice to Protect Tenants\n\u2014 will have. Weaver has made clear she believes for-profit ownership is the cause of the housing crisis.\nWill she be kept in check by more moderate, higher-ranking Mamdani aides such as Deputy Mayor\nLeila Bozorg\n? Will new HPD Commissioner Dina Levy be reasonable or ideological?\nThe best-case scenario is that now that Mamdani has the keys to the kingdom, he will realize no secret remedies for housing violations have been hidden within its walls. Unfortunately, the \u201crental ripoff\u201d show trials will only promote scapegoating, conspiracy theories and magical thinking, making real solutions even harder to achieve.\n",

        "content": "Robert Rivani is going after restaurateur Derek Gonzalez of Goat Hospitality Group for $10.5 million over a failed plan to open a steakhouse in Wynwood.\nRivani claims in court filings that Gonzalez\u2019s WGOAT15 owes $9.1 million in rent through 2035, plus taxes and common area maintenance, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nGonzalez signed a lease in 2024 to open Mia Steakhouse at Rivani\u2019s\nWynwood Jungle\nbuilding at 50 Northwest 24th Street in Miami. Last summer, Rivani\u2019s entities RJR Realty and RJR ML sued Gonzalez\u2019s affiliate, claiming it failed to pay May and June rent, and didn\u2019t open on time.\nRivani won possession of the property in August, but is now claiming damages against Gonzalez.\nRivani\nis an investor who moved his company in 2022 from Los Angeles to Miami, scooping up restaurant spaces and commercial buildings. In Miami Beach, he owns and is renovating the seven-story Rivani office building at 1691 Washington Avenue, where\nPlayboy\u2019s parent company\nwill move its headquarters.\nGonzalez\u2019s Goat Hospitality\u2019s venues include\nLuna Sol Night Club\nin Wynwood.\nRivani and Gonzalez are locked in the dispute partly over who was responsible for what payments. Under their agreement, Gonzalez was to pay for the restaurant\u2019s interior buildout and start paying rent early last year. Rivani was to cover the costs for the architect and interior designer.\nGonzalez said in a deposition that he thinks Rivani\u2019s entities led to the restaurant\u2019s opening delay partly by failing to release construction funds. Gonzalez also admitted that he didn\u2019t meet thresholds for the money to be released such as finishing the buildout.\nIn a countersuit against Rivani filed last week, Gonzalez again accused Rivani\u2019s affiliates of failing to pay for architects, interior designers and other agreed vendors, stalling the project.\nThe landlord also didn\u2019t provide electrical utility meters for the property, according to the counterclaim. Gonzalez claimed he was led to sign the lease partly by the landlord\u2019s false claims about other tenants signing up for space at Wynwood Jungle, including rapper Machine Gun Kelly.\nLisa Gonzalez, who is Gonzalez\u2019s attorney and wife, said that Mia Steakhouse didn\u2019t open because of the landlord\u2019s failures to meet its responsibilities, and that lease amendments were signed under pressure. She also said the dispute is part of\nbroader issues\nbetween the landlord and other tenants at Wynwood Jungle.\nThe lease terms were amended several times last year.\nAttorneys for Rivani\u2019s affiliates didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment. In court filings, they have reiterated that the landlord was on the hook only to pay the architects and interior designers.\u00a0\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "David Herro\nwill be sporting a haircut when he exits the Palmolive Building.\nThe deputy chairman of Harris Associates found a buyer for his full-floor condo in the Magnificent Mile building at 159 East Walton Place on Monday, marking the end of a five-year search to offload the property that saw its\nasking price slashed by nearly half\n.\nThe 31st-floor unit went under contract Monday with a price of just under $6 million, listing data shows. While the sale is not final and the ultimate price isn\u2019t known, the current asking price is a 45 percent drop from the $10.9 million Herro sought when he first listed in July 2020.\nAt $6 million, the sale would mark a loss for Herro, who paid $6.75 million for the unit in December 2013 \u2014 about $9.5 million in today\u2019s money, adjusting for inflation \u2014 property records show.\nThe three-bedroom, four-bathroom condo spans 5,500 square feet and features a renovation by Liederbach &amp; Graham Architects and interiors by Steven Gambrel that landed the home a\nfeature in Elle Decor\nin 2017. The unit comes with four spaces in a heated garage, a private elevator and three fireplaces.\nIt carries a hefty $9,230 monthly homeowner\u2019s association fee, and had a 2024 property tax bill of about $67,000, according to property records.\nThe unit\u2019s hard sell was a result of a downtown market that languished in the years after it was offered for sale. Other luxury condos at the top of the market, including\nKen Griffin\u2019s penthouse\nat 800 North Michigan Avenue and\nBill Farley\u2019s condo\nat 209 East Lakeshore Drive have also had to cut prices to find buyers after years on the market.\nAfter first listing for $10.9 million, Herro cut the price to $9.9 million in late 2020, then to $8.9 million in 2022 and $7.5 million in 2023. He pulled the listing in July 2024 before relisting it in September 2025 at $6.75 million, the same price he paid a decade prior.\nThe final price chop to $6 million came in December, just a month before the unit went under contract.\nKen Jungwirth of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represents the listing. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite the steep losses, if the condo fetches the $6 million asking price, it would be among the most expensive units to sell at the Palmolive building in the last few years. The 32nd-floor penthouse sold for $5.2 million in 2023, while the 23rd-floor unit brought in\njust under $5.2 million\nin February 2025, according to listing records.\n",

It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nMultifamily distress hit Houston hard in 2025, but the largest loan headed to auction this month isn\u2019t tied to an apartment complex. Miami-based Terra Hospitality is facing foreclosure on Heritage Place Houston Brookhollow, a 197-key hotel at 2504 North Loop West in Northwest Houston. Terra reportedly defaulted on a $50.9 million loan provided by Wells Fargo tied to the property.\nAustin\nBrennen Degner\u2019s DB Capital Management could lose an Austin apartment building to foreclosure this month. The Denver-based firm is accused of defaulting on the $14.3 million loan backed by Ascent at Northgate, a 112-unit apartment complex at 1830 West Rundberg Lane. ReadyCap Commercial provided the loan in 2021, deed records show. It works out to $127,678 per unit for the property built in 1972. The loan was assigned to Los Angeles-based Ascendant Capital Partners in August.\nSan Antonio\nIt\u2019s most common to see apartment buildings from the 1970s on the auction block, but that\u2019s not the case with Broadstone Colonnade Apartments. The 280-unit property at 4330 Spectrum One was built in 2005. David Shippy\u2019s Quantum Leap Multifamily Group bought the property in 2022 with a $40 million loan from CBRE, which comes out to $142,857 per unit.\nQuantum Leap partnered with Edcouch Community Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Quantum Leap sold the property to Edcouch, an affordable housing organization 250 miles from San Antonio, and leased the ground. Gov. Greg Abbott\nsigned a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors.\nDallas\nWhen it seems like there\u2019s nothing left for\nTides Equities\nto lose, the embattled syndicator gets hit with another foreclosure notice. This time, the firm owned by Sean Kia and Ryan Andrade could lose Tides at Highland Meadows, a 650-unit apartment complex at 11330 Amanda Lane in Dallas. New York-based Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies provided the $76.4 million loan tied to the property built in 1984. It works out to $117,461 per unit.\nFort Worth\nBruce Hall\u2019s AllTrades Industrial Properties could lose a 3.5-acre plot of land at 5001 Golden Triangle Boulevard in Fort Worth at this month\u2019s auction. AllTrades Industrial Properties bought the property in 2022 with a $5.8 million loan from Susser Bank.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, 12 have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been to the block before:\nLatitude 2976, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive in Houston ($77.2 million);\nMia Riverside, a 312-unit complex at 1601 Royal Crest Drive in Austin ($50.2 million);\nDecorative Center of Houston, a 500,000-square-foot design center at 5120 Woodway Drive ($50 million).\nVerandah Flats, a 120-unit apartment complex at 7130 Gaston Avenue ($26.5 million);\nTesoro at 12 Apartments, a 184-unit apartment complex 4271 Altoona Drive in Dallas ($24.2 million);\nAugusta North Houston, a 212-unit apartment complex at 12655 Kuykendahl Road in Houston ($22.7 million);\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 in Austin ($16 million);\nWyndham Garden Austin, at 3401 South Interstate 35 ($13.4 million);\nThe London, a 32-unit apartment complex at 5601 Gaston Avenue in Dallas ($12.9 million);\nIconic at The Station, a 75-unit apartment complex at 6810 Glendora Avenue in San Antonio ($4.9 million).\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio ($10.5 million);\nLa Bella Vista Apartments, a 152-unit complex at 3600 South Shaver Street in Houston ($9.2 million); and\n",

        "content": "Simon Dushinsky is gearing up to fill in a pit.\nThe Rabsky Group filed plans for a 24-story, 106-unit project at 65 Franklin Street in Tribeca, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The parcel on the corner of Franklin Street and Broadway is already excavated, but has sat empty and earned a rep\nas a neighborhood eyesore\n.\nDushinsky\u2019s firm previously proposed a 20-story, 89-unit project on the site, alternately addressed as 360 Broadway. But Rabsky was able to increase the scope of the development thanks to the City of Yes zoning reforms.\nLast summer, Rabsky\nlocked down\n$320 million in construction financing for the ground-up project, obtaining the debt from G4 Capital Partners. The latest filing doesn\u2019t indicate if Rabsky is building rentals or condominiums, but previous reporting points to the latter.\nDushinsky did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nThe assemblage was formerly in the hands of HAP Investments, the firm led by Eran Polack, which planned a 19-story, 41-unit condo on the site. HAP picked up the land in 2018 for $46 million and spent years considering a project that never got off the ground.\nThe firm sold 360 Broadway to Rabsky in March for $57.6 million, setting the stage for a reinvention of the site. Rabsky also bought the parcel next door in September for $47.5 million, as well as 25,000 square feet of air rights above 67 Franklin Street for $3.6 million.\nThe site has a sordid history of litigation. Charles Dayan\u2019s Bonjour Capital controlled 59 Franklin Street through an LLC, which sued HAP Investments and Noble Construction Group, claiming negligent work at 65 Franklin Street destabilized the building. He was seeking at least $15 million.\nBonjour once filed plans to build an 18-story, 89,000-square-foot building with 89 luxury rentals at 59 Franklin.\nElsewhere in the city, Rabsky and Joel Gluck\u2019s Spencer Equity Group recently\ntook over\nthe long-term ground lease at 356 Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn from Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development in a $39 million deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Last month, former \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and estranged husband Mossimo Giannulli sold their home for $16.5 million, up from the $13 million they paid for it four years earlier.\nApple CEO Tim Cook\n, singer Justin Bieber, reality TV personality Kourtney Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner, supermodel Cindy Crawford and music mogul Scooter Braun have also planted flags in La Quinta, per Realtor.com. The median home listing price there is $875,000. There are currently 188 homes listed for $1 million or more and 24 listed for $5 million and above.\nThe golf communities and mountain backdrops offer a \u201cbalance between resort-style living and a true residential community\u201d as well as \u201can exceptional level of privacy that attracts high-net-worth and celebrity homeowners,\u201d Karen Ahaesy, a Compass real estate agent and La Quinta resident, told\nRealtor.com\n. Wealthy residents have access to\nThe Thermal Club\n, an exclusive private motorsport club; the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport for private jet access; and the ritzy Zenyara events venue.\nBuyers from Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco and out-of-state markets like Texas and the Pacific Northwest have been attracted to La Quinta because of the space, privacy, amenities and newer construction, according to Aheasy. The uptick of remote and hybrid work, as well as low inventory in top luxury communities such as The Madison Club, Hideaway, Tradition and The Quarry have driven up home values in La Quinta. There\u2019s also a strong demand for second homes in the town.\nLa Quinta, in contrast to nearby Indian Wells,\nPalm Springs\nand Palm Desert, offers a unique living environment. The mix of high-end living, privacy, natural beauty, contemporary homes and access to golf, tennis, equestrian sports and private air travel is \u201crare not just in the Coachella Valley, but anywhere in California,\u201d Aheasy said.\n\u201cPalm Springs is more urban, midcentury and nightlife-oriented,\u201d Aheasy said. \u201cNearby Indian Wells is elegant and established, but smaller and more traditional.\u201d Palm Desert serves as the retail and commercial center of the Coachella Valley. \u201cLa Quinta is quieter, newer and known for high-end gated communities and custom architectural estates,\u201d Aheasy said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Miller also sought to resolve issues between agents and brokerages as a presiding officer for ethics and arbitration for the Greater Los Angeles Association of Realtors. In more recent years she had stepped away from those trade association roles, but her impact on real estate was clearly widespread as news of her death was learned.\n\u201cSuch sad news. She has the legacy of being a powerhouse and she will be missed.\u201d John J. Dean Jr. from\nEngel &amp; V\u00f6lkers\n\u2019 Boston office said on\nFacebook\n.\nUschi Brunner in the brokerage\u2019s Denver office echoed on the social media platform the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d sentiment, adding Miller was an \u201cinspiration\u201d and a \u201cleader.\u201d\n\u201cShe was one of the best. I always looked up to what she achieved. I\u2019ll miss her,\u201d Charli Bullard of the firm\u2019s Oklahoma City office said on Facebook.\nIgnoring the naysayers\nMiller, who had over $3 billion in career sales across residential, commercial and advisory, made the jump to real estate from sales in the telecommunications field. She managed to carve a path for herself in both industries, but didn\u2019t sugarcoat the sometimes uphill battle that went into that effort.\nShe partially detailed what she called one of her \u201cpet peeves as a woman\u201d when it came to working in a sales environment during an\ninterview with Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers colleague Alan Canas\n. Canas is based in the company\u2019s Burlingame office and posted a portion of that conversation on Instagram and Facebook in late December in a tribute to Miller.\nMiller recalled how \u201cespecially the women, for some reason, will all tell you how hard the business is and how much you\u2019re going to fail,\u201d noting she found that same experience to hold working at both wireless and real estate companies.\n\u201cI saw that over and over again in my life and in my career and I watched it in other companies that I helped form within the wireless business,\u201d she told Canas. \u201cAnd, so I swore that I wouldn\u2019t ever put myself in that situation in real estate because real estate\u2019s even worse. Because a lot of these women\u2026 started when their kids were little, and they were doing it part time and they just kind of grew into it and so there\u2019s offices filled with people that aren\u2019t productive that can\u2019t wait to tell the new people how bad they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nMiller instead took a different path and supported the mentorship program WomanUp to help guide agents and brokers nationally, the brokerage said in a statement released Monday.\nThe Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Santa Monica business is now being led by Miller\u2019s son Steven Walter and brokerage manager Raymond Dominguez.\nInformation on a service or celebration of life is expected to be distributed privately.\n",

The auction, for more than 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments, is slated for Thursday.\nThe filing follows Mamdani\u2019s\nannouncement\nthat he would intervene in the case and a similar request by the Adams administration to delay the auction. Pinnacle tenants had urged the Adams administration to intervene in the case, wanting more time to weigh in on future ownership.\nBut the new request goes further than its predecessor: not only does the administration want more time to consider who buys the properties, it also warns that the future health of the buildings is imperiled by the fact that most of the units are rent-regulated.\n\u201cHPD\u2019s preliminary internal analysis, based on information and belief, is that the proposed sale would not lead to a supportable business as long as the properties continued to have exclusively rent stabilized or rent controlled units because the current rents are very low-averaging,\u201d the filing states, pointing to increased distress and citing letters from tenants detailing health and safety problems at the buildings.\nSuch an acknowledgement comes as the administration is pushing to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for the next four years.\nA landlord group quickly seized on the filing\u2019s language, saying it was a stunning admission by the city that stabilized rents cannot support building operations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an astounding contradiction from the Mamdani administration, less than a week into their admin,\u201d said Kenny Burgos, CEO New York Apartment Association. He said the financial realities of the Pinnacle portfolio are shared by other rent-stabilized buildings where the 2019 rent laws closed off most options for raising rents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if this is some sort of anomaly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the norm.\u201d\nNYAA was part of a federal lawsuit\nchallenging\nthe state\u2019s rent stabilization system, which was dismissed and ultimately not picked up by the U.S. Supreme Court. The group has also argued against the mayor\u2019s plans to freeze rents for stabilized tenants.\nA City Hall source pointed to the reference to the \u201cproposed sale\u201d as a critical part of HPD\u2019s analysis, noting that the danger of the sale price being too high plays a significant role in the properties\u2019 future viability. The filing posits that if the buildings fall into disrepair, tenants may be pushed out and replaced by higher-paying residents unaware that their units are regulated.\nCea Weaver, Mamdani\u2019s newly-appointed head of the Office to Protect Tenants, previously told the New York Times that it is unfair to blame rent stabilization for the state of Pinnacle\u2019s buildings. She said the landlord\u2019s record of \u201cegregiously treating renters\u201d predates the 2019 law.\nThese latest filings object to the sale of Pinnacle\u2019s properties to Summit Properties USA, which made a\n$451 million stalking horse offer\nto acquire the buildings. Pinnacle, owned by billionaire Joel Wiener, amassed hundreds of stabilized units in the city over the years, many of which have fallen behind on maintenance and racked up housing code violations. In an effort to stave off foreclosure, 82 of the firm\u2019s entities\nfiled for bankruptcy\nlast May, leading to this week\u2019s scheduled auction. The city argues that it wants time to ensure that the new owner of the firm\u2019s stabilized apartments can address $12.7 million in unpaid bills and violations.\nThe administration notes its \u201csubstantial concern\u201d that Summit \u201cmay not have sufficient resources or willingness to rehabilitate the properties, or be able to maintain a profitable business based on the income stream from the rent stabilized or rent controlled apartments in the properties.\u201d\nThe city states that the next owner of the buildings must be able to show that the transfer of the buildings won\u2019t result in further distress and devolve into \u201cfinancial and social chaos potentially worse than the current situation of the Debtors themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIf Summit cannot \u2013 or does not \u2013 remediate the violations the costs of doing so might well fall upon the city, which might have no means to recover such costs,\u201d the filing states.\nThe filing states that the properties shouldn\u2019t be transferred to Summit because the company has \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the Properties can support the proposed sale price and maintenance needs and costs given the regulated rents.\u201d The administration wants more time to review Summit\u2019s plan and to \u201cexplore alternatives.\u201d\nThe filing was submitted by Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant, a holdover from the Adams administration. Mamdani\u2019s nomination for the role, Steven Banks, awaits approval by the City Council.\nMamdani announced his plans to intervene in the case shortly after\ntaking office\n, as part of several early actions related to housing. He also unveiled plans to hold a series of\nhearings\naimed at uncovering landlord neglect and finding policy solutions to tenant complaints.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan office leasing closed out last year\nlike it was 2019, posting its strongest quarter since before the pandemic.\nDemand surged, availability tightened and rents pushed higher across much of the city, according to Colliers data. Leasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter-over-quarter to 11.9 million square feet, the borough\u2019s most active quarter since late 2019.\n\u201cThe year 2025 will be remembered as a watershed moment in the Manhattan office market\u2019s recovery,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Franklin Wallach, one of the report\u2019s authors.\nFor the full year, tenants inked nearly 42 million square feet of deals, the highest yearly total since 2019, when the borough notched almost 43 million square feet of leasing. That marks a 26 percent increase from 2024.\nThe burst of activity in the fourth quarter was fueled by a handful of big deals.\nBloomberg renewed nearly 496,000 square feet\nat Global Holdings\u2019 120 Park Avenue,\nMoody\u2019s signed a 460,000-square-foot lease\nat Brookfield Properties\u2019 200 Liberty Street and\nMillennium Management extended its 438,000-square-foot footprint\nat 399 Park Avenue. Class A buildings captured more than 74 percent of leasing volume, continuing the market\u2019s flight-to-quality trend.\nTenant demand translated into tightening conditions. Manhattan\u2019s availability rate fell to 13.9 percent, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter and marking the seventh straight quarter of stable or declining availability, the longest streak since 2007. Sublet space also continued to shrink, with availability falling to its lowest level since 2019.\nRents crept higher in turn. The average asking rent climbed to $76 per square foot, up 1.5 percent from the third quarter and the highest level since October 2020. Class A asking rents rose to $83 per square foot, while Class B rents hit a record high of almost $69 per square foot.\nMidtown led the borough in leasing volume, posting 5.3 million square feet of deals in the quarter, while Midtown South logged its strongest quarter since 2019. Downtown leasing more than doubled from the prior quarter, helped by large leases from Moody\u2019s, the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Stripe.\nFinancial services, insurance and real estate firms (FIRE) were the most active tenants, accounting for 37 percent of leasing activity boroughwide, followed closely by TAMI (technology, advertising, media and information) companies.\nStill, Wallach cautioned that the market has only worked through about half of its post-pandemic excess supply.\n",

        "content": "Sovereign Partners is ruling its domain at 100 Fifth Avenue thanks to a refinancing package.\nRialto Capital provided a $150 million loan to refinance the Midtown South office building, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. A Newmark team including Jordan Roeschlaub and Chris Kramer negotiated the deal.\nSovereign \u2014 led by brothers Cyrus and Darius Sakhai \u2014 acquired the 20-story office building in 2023\nfor $126.5 million\n. That was barely half the $230 million price Clarion Partners paid to acquire the property a decade earlier.\nDuring its short stewardship of the building, Sovereign has brought the 277,000-square-foot property up to full occupancy, inking 170,000 square feet of new leases. Adobe is the building\u2019s anchor tenant.\nBeyond the refi, it\u2019s been a busy couple of months for the Sakhais.\nLast month, Sovereign Partners sealed the deal\non a $273 million acquisition\nof 2 Grand Central Tower from Rockwood Capital. The deal for the 667,000-square-foot property broke down to $409 per square foot. The last time Rockwood tried to sell (back in February 2020), the private equity investor had expected to sell the tower for\nclose to $580 million\n.\nRockwood purchased the office building in 2011 from Boston Properties, now BXP, for $401 million. Boston Properties bought it for almost $428 million in 2008 from Harry Macklowe, who developed it.\nRialto, through its affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s\nlargest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes\n. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nThe company\u2019s servicing arm has garnered a reputation for aggressive techniques. New York landlords who borrowed from the since-collapsed Signature Bank have accused Rialto of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing\u201d defaults,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The price for John Novak\u2019s year-end deal to buy the troubled southern portion of Lincoln Yards from JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling Bay amounted to $34 million.\nNovak Construction acquired the 18.4 acres of vacant riverfront land where Chicago-based Sterling Bay had proposed a huge multibillion-dollar mixed-use campus. CoStar first\nreported\nthe sale price. The property sits just west of the empty life sciences building Sterling built at 1229 West Concord Place, a 284,000-square-foot\nlab and office property\nthat remains the only completed building at the proposed megadevelopment.\nThe sale follows the announcement that\ntwo other parcels\nadjacent to the Lincoln Yards site sold last month to an affiliate of Calgary, Alberta-based Jack Carter Automotive Group. It paid $15.5 million for the parcels at 1642 North Besly Court and 1400 West North Avenue.\nNovak\u2019s purchase was the second try at a deal for the southern portion of the site. JP Morgan and Sterling Bay first attempted to sell the site earlier last year to developers JDL and Kayne Anderson at a price Chicago real estate sources pegged at about $60 million. That deal eventually fell apart after JP Morgan balked on completing the transaction.\nKayne and JDL did however form a development team last year to buy the northern\n30-plus acres\nof Lincoln Yards \u2014 which sits on the other side of the Chicago River from Novak\u2019s purchase \u2014 from Bank OZK. Bank OZK had stripped that portion of riverfront property from Sterling Bay and Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, its other partner on the megadevelopment, through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. JDL and Kayne have since sought Chicago City Council approval to build more than 3,700 residential units on that stretch.\nNovak told\nThe Real Deal\nlast month that the\nLincoln Yards deal\nwould amount to the most land his firm has ever purchased for development. The 45-year-old company began as a general contractor, but in recent years has forayed into development projects that include big box retailers such as Target and Whole Foods.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Meyer Chetrit appeared in court briefly Tuesday morning, where he and his brother Joseph are facing criminal tenant harassment charges that could see the landlords serve prison time.\nMeyer spent about 15 minutes in front of the judge at Manhattan\u2019s Supreme Court building, dressed in a tan cardigan, brown pants and a blue scarf hanging around the back of his neck. Joseph\u2019s appearance had been waived due to an infirmity.\nThe brothers had already pleaded not guilty several months ago to two counts of tenant harassment. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, two of the LLCs involved in the case entered not-guilty pleas, and the defendants signed a consent protective order regarding the tenants.\nMeyer gave a few quiet, one-word replies when questioned by the judge, and a few moments later the largely uneventful hearing was adjourned. The brothers are due back in court on April 29.\nHe\nwas indicted\nin September by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree. Those charges are classified as a class E felony and carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nAccording to the allegations, Meyer had \u201cwaged a campaign of harassment\u201d against two elderly, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over a period of five years, hoping they would move out so the building could be sold.\nThe tenants lived at 117-119 West 26th Street in Chelsea since the 1980s. Chetrit purchased the building in 2005 but allegedly failed to complete its conversion from commercial lofts to residential housing. The apartments are classified as \u201cinterim multiple dwellings\u201d and overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board.\nIn addition to extended periods without heat and a ceiling collapse, the building has been without an elevator since September 2023, the DA\u2019s office said. That year, part of the building\u2019s unoccupied commercial section collapsed, prompting a partial vacate order.\n\u201cFrom winters without heat and unrepaired roofs causing leaks and ceiling collapses, these New Yorkers were forced to live in uninhabitable conditions,\u201d Bragg said in a statement.\nJoseph\nwas indicted\nlater in October and charged as a co-defendant.\nThe Chetrits\u2019 arrest has become a\nlightning rod\nfor tenant advocates.\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the Upper West Side where the brothers own\nthe Park West Village\non Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets, said he launched a confidential survey to determine the scope of the problem.\nElected officials on the Upper West Side have raised alarms about\nChetrit\u2019s management of the Park West Village\n, where tenants there have accused Chetrit of pocketing city rent subsidies without crediting them to renters\u2019 accounts, and then pursuing eviction.\n\u201cMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment echoes the pattern of harassment and mismanagement that tenants in my district have reported for years under his management,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cNo landlord should take taxpayer funds, bill tenants twice, and leave people in unsafe homes.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The future\nof the Brooklyn Mirage\nis coming into focus.\nFive Holdings acquired the entertainment complex at 140 Stewart Avenue in East Williamsburg for $110 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Five Holdings is the parent company of nightlife brand Pacha \u2014 known for its famed Ibiza nightclub \u2014 and will set up shop in Brooklyn.\nThe acquisition by the Dubai-based holding company was first reported by\nTraded\n.\nPacha\u2019s deal is the latest twist in the fate of a venue as known for its storied live music scene as its propensity to harbor drug use, aggressive security and even death; a Gothamist\ninvestigation\nfound three visitors died of drug overdoses between 2018 and mid-2022.\nThe venue closed for renovations last year, setting a May 1 opening date and a summer full of shows. But the venue failed to meet its inspection deadline and the Department of Buildings yanked its temporary occupancy certificate, Brooklyn Paper\nreported\n; an agency spokesperson declared the venue unsafe.\nAvant Gardner\u2019s parent company filed for bankruptcy in early August, reporting\n$153.3 million in funded debt obligations\n, according to Bloomberg. The chief executive officer \u2014 himself a DJ \u2014 blamed financial troubles on the loss of the Mirage and aggressive lenders. The company claimed it was working with DOB on a remediation plan.\nHowever, ownership in October\nfiled for a demolition permit\nfor at least part of the venue. The application was for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet; the overall complex is roughly 80,000 square feet and the estimated cost of razing is $1.5 million.\nShortly after the permit was filed, private equity firm and lender Axar Capital Management reached a deal to buy the venue for $110 million with an eye towards reopening in 2026. As the calendar flipped, however, so did Axar, which agreed instead to have the property sold to Five Holdings for the same price.\nIt\u2019s unclear when Pacha\u2019s slice of European nightlife will hit Brooklyn\u2019s waters. Representatives for the buyer and seller did not respond to the Observer\u2019s requests for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Luxury deals drove Manhattan\u2019s sales market\nfor most of 2025, but by year\u2019s end, the momentum trickled down.\nLast quarter, co-op sales \u2014 generally priced below condos \u2014 outpaced condo deals in the borough for the first time in more than a year, powered by a steady decline in mortgage rates during the back half of the year, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s\nquarterly report\nfor Douglas Elliman.\n\u201cAs mortgage rates drifted lower, we saw an improvement in sales of lower-priced units because those buyers are more reliant on mortgage rates,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller, who added that mortgage rates had fallen 60 basis points since the summer.\nThe rise in co-op deals fueled an increase in sales across both property types in the three-month period, despite fears that New York City\u2019s mayoral election and its victor, Zohran Mamdani, would chill sales.\n\u201cThe housing market right now is a Goldilocks market,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s just right.\u201d\nManhattan nabbed more than 2,600 closed sales in the fourth quarter, up 5 percent from less than 2,500 in the same period in 2024. The median sale price was $1.13 million, up slightly from $1.1 million during the same time frame.\nRoughly 1,500 co-ops traded in the fourth quarter, up 7 percent from fewer than 1,400 in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the same period, the borough logged 1,200 condo sales, up just 3 percent year-over-year from 1,100. The median sale price of co-ops was $825,000, while the median sale price of a condo was $1.7 million.\nIf rates continue to dwindle, which Miller said many economists expect, it\u2019s likely activity at the lower end of the market could continue to bolster sales across the borough through the first quarter of 2026, especially as a\nboom in deals for luxury\nproperties throughout the first three quarters of last year tightened inventory levels at the highest end of the market.\nListings for luxury homes \u2014 defined in the report as the top 10 percent of condo and co-op sales \u2014 fell 15 percent annually, outpacing the overall market, where inventory dropped just 4 percent. While the decrease was less substantial, co-op and condo inventory in Manhattan fell to its lowest level since 2017.\nLast quarter was a departure from the rest of 2025, which saw modest increases in inventory in the first three quarters, though growth in the number of sales was outpacing listings hitting the market for most of those periods.\n\u201cWe have a housing market that is not showing the \u2018Mamdani effect,\u2019\u201d Miller said. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re seeing sales edge higher, prices edge higher and inventory declining, with the biggest drop at the top of the market because that segment has been outperforming the balance of the market.\u201d\nDespite a decline in mortgage rates, cash sales still dominated in the fourth quarter, with three out of four buyers purchasing their condos in all-cash deals. Cash sales hit their highest market share in at least a decade in 2025, with roughly 65 percent of purchases made with all cash.\nRoughly 7.5 percent of sales closed in the fourth quarter were the result of\nbidding wars\n, marking the highest share in three years. Despite the rise, Miller said bidding wars are still in the range considered normal for Manhattan, where the record share was 31 percent in 2015.\nWhile the lower end of the market stole the spotlight last quarter, Miller said the luxury market is still \u201cin a good position to fare better, regardless of rates,\u201d thanks to two \u201cbanner years\u201d for Wall Street.\n",

Thomas Duane filed a lawsuit looking to block the redevelopment of the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The lawsuit claims NYCHA\u2019s plan is illegal, as it involves leasing the properties to Related Companies, ostensibly in violation of a state law dating back to 2010.\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that the city of New York would sell its land and low-income housing to a private developer,\u201d Duane said in a statement. He represented the neighborhood for 14 years in the state senate.\nDuane expressed fear about displacement, citing statistics. The lawsuit cited a study from the comptroller\u2019s office that found eviction rates at privatized public housing to be 0.57 percent, compared to a 0.12 percent rate at more conventional NYCHA complexes.\nNYCHA declined to comment on the lawsuit due to pending litigation.\nIt\u2019s the latest challenge to NYCHA\u2019s $2 billion plan to demolish and rebuild the pair of properties.\nIn November, a judge\nrefused\nto order two senior citizens residing in the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses to immediately vacate. Most of the residents are able to stay in place while work is done to build the forthcoming properties, but some are being asked to temporarily relocate and not all are willing, leading to multiple lawsuits.\nNYCHA and Related\nfiled plans\nfor a 12-story, 217-unit building at 401 West 19th Street over the summer.\nThe development team, which also includes Essence Development, is replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also build retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments, 1,000 of which will be put aside at affordable rates.\nLast month, the Public Authorities Control Board approved the redevelopment of the first apartment tower, a project expected to cost $1.2 million per unit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The complex, at 333 Northeast Sixth Street in Fort Lauderdale, is on tap as South Florida feels pressure from a supply overhang following years of hefty multifamily completions.\nBridgeInvest, based in Miami, provided the floating-rate loan, which refinanced Midtown Capital\u2019s construction loan and funded remaining completion costs, according to a news release from the financing\u2019s broker.\nMitch Sinberg and Scott Wadler were part of the Berkadia team that represented the borrower.\nMidtown Capital obtained a\n$64.5 million\nconstruction financing for Astor Park in 2022.\nApartments will range from studios spanning nearly 600 square feet to penthouses spanning nearly 1,800 square feet, according to the release. Astor Park will include four live-work ground-floor apartments; 2,400 square feet of retail; and a 318-space garage. All apartments will be at market-rate rents.\nThe 1.4-acre site is across from Peter Feldman Park.\nBerkadia and Midtown Capital didn\u2019t immediately return inquiries about pre-leasing at Astor Park.\nMidtown Capital, led by Alejandro Velez, also plans a\n22-story, 348-unit\nLive Local Act building in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood; and it\u2019s developing the 230-unit Astor Sound apartment complex in Lake Worth Beach. It scored a\n$57 million\nbridge loan in September for the nearly finished Astor Sound.\nMultifamily developers seized on the influx of out-of-state residents to South Florida and ensuing apartment leasing frenzy in recent years by starting new projects.\nDespite a record\n18,600\nunit completions in 2024, developers kept building, with the tri-county region recording\n14,515\napartment construction starts in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to CoStar Group. The supply overhang led to slower leaseups, a decrease in rents and more concessions.\nDevelopers building multifamily have countered that leasing will resume by the time they finish their buildings and that they are carefully picking the submarkets for their projects to ensure the areas aren\u2019t over-saturated.\nAlso in Fort Lauderdale, Moderno Development Group and 75Invest received site plan approval in September for the 26-story, 265-unit Art Lofts with 43 workforce housing units south of the New River.\n",

New York-based Vanbarton Group bought 101 Mission in 2018 for $163 million before defaulting on a $93 million mortgage. Vanbarton spent more than $30 million renovating common areas and tenant spaces.\nThe deal for the 1985-built building is a deed in lieu of foreclosure, meaning the property was sold by lenders who foreclosed on the debt tied to the building. Last July, activist investor Elliott Investment Management\nacquired the $93 million debt\nfor an undisclosed amount before marketing the property for sale.\nThe building spans 213,000 square feet and is more than 50 percent occupied. Tenants include real estate firm\nRubicon Point Partners\nand beverage producer Constellation Brands.\nCallahan Capital\u2019s purchase marks the company\u2019s first office buy in San Francisco. The firm plans to renovate the building and \u201cmove forward quickly with a thoughtful repositioning strategy,\u201d CEO Tim Callahan said in a statement.\nProbis got involved in the purchase because it saw the San Francisco office market showing \u201cmeaningful signs of recovery\u201d as\nartificial intelligence firms moved into town\nand snapped up more office space, David Dowdney, managing partner of Probis, said. The company \u201cbelieve[s] high-quality, well-located office buildings in San Francisco are entering a new phase of opportunity, and 101 Mission is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from that recovery.\u201d\nLast spring, Brookfield Properties\nwas in talks\nto buy the debt linked to 101 Mission Street, as an affiliate of the New York-based company originated a mezzanine loan for Vanbarton\u2019s 2018 purchase of the building. But Brookfield and loan seller ING Group couldn\u2019t come to an agreement with lender partners about how to move forward, and the deal ultimately\nfell through\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A pair of aging buildings at one of downtown Austin\u2019s busiest corners could soon come down, clearing the way for new development \u2014 if the city\u2019s Historic Landmark Commission signs off.\nOn Wednesday, the commission is set to consider a demolition permit for 422 Congress Avenue and 101 West Fifth Street, according to the meeting agenda. Los Angeles-based Karlin Real Estate, which owns the properties, has already filed the application, and city staff are recommending approval,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal.\nThe proposed teardown would directly affect\nShiner\u2019s Saloon\n, the longtime bar that has occupied the ground floor space since 2008. Co-owner and manager David Jalufka said the bar\u2019s lease runs through the end of April, though renewals in recent years have been short-term. He said he would prefer to keep Shiner\u2019s in place, but acknowledged its future is uncertain.\nThe two buildings date back more than a century combined. The structure at 101 West Fifth Street was built in 1914, while the building at\n422 Congress Avenue\nfollowed in 1940. Despite their age, neither property contributes to the Congress Avenue National Register District, according to commission documents, weakening any preservation argument. The properties once belonged to Nate Paul\u2019s\nWorld Class Holdings\n.\nCity staff\u2019s recommendation includes conditions: salvaging any remaining original materials discovered during demolition and ensuring the work does not damage the structure at 416 Congress Avenue, an 1890s-era historic building that shares a wall with the sites slated for removal.\nKarlin declined to comment on its plans. A site plan application has been filed with the city, but its status is listed as \u201cnot started,\u201d offering no clues about what might rise in place of the existing buildings.\nThe property spans just 0.17 acres, and developers have the potential to maximize the vertical space. The properties sit at the southwest corner of Congress Avenue and West Fifth Street, a prime downtown location where density can soar.\nUnder Austin\u2019s land development code, a project participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program could reach a floor-to-area ratio of 25-to-1, with no hard height limit, subject to City Council approval.\nThat potential is partially complicated by a Capitol View Corridor slicing through a portion of 422 Congress Avenue, imposing height restrictions meant to protect sightlines to the Texas State Capitol. Still, most of the site lies outside the corridor, opening the door to a staggered tower design that steps down near Congress and climbs higher toward the rear.\nDowntown Austin is currently capped at 350 feet after the City Council imposed a temporary\nheight limit\nin October. But for developers willing to pay into the bonus program, the sky remains the real limit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Douglas Elliman\u2019s biggest brokers in Brooklyn is returning to Compass.\nLindsay Barton Barrett, known for brokering some of the borough\u2019s priciest deals, is exiting Elliman after seven years to join Compass, where she was previously an agent. Joining her at Compass are her four team members, including Kaitlin McGlynn, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr.\n\u201cIt really feels like a homecoming,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world from when I left.\u201d\nUnder the Compass banner, Barrett said she plans to add more agents to her team, which also represents listings in Downtown Manhattan.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve always had a super lean team, I think right now we might be a little too lean for the amount of business we\u2019re doing,\u201d Barrett said.\nBarrett began her first stint at Compass in 2015, when she left Corcoran to join the fledgling firm among an early class of New York City-based recruits. At the time of her move, the brokerage, then known as Urban Compass, had also just brought over 25 other agents from Corcoran to build out its headcount, which was then in the hundreds. Barrett said by the time she departed roughly four years later, that number had grown to more than 10,000.\nBarrett\njumped to Elliman\nin 2018, a move she credited, in part, to wanting to be with a more traditional, legacy brokerage. Once onboard the new firm, she began to enhance her focus on new development.\nWhile at Elliman, she led sales at the Brooklyn Home Company\u2019s 350 Butler Street in Park Slope, which sold out in August, and launched sales at the developer\u2019s 524 Halsey Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is roughly 85 percent sold.\nDuring her tenure at Elliman, Barrett closed some of the borough\u2019s most expensive townhouse trades, including representing billionaire Vincent Viola and his wife, Theresa, in the\n$25.5 million\nsale of their home at 8 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights. The deal closed in 2021, marking the highest price ever achieved for a home in the borough.\nBarrett also represented the Brooklyn Home Company in their 2024 sale of 1 Sidney Place, which Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, bought for\n$22.1 million\n. The deal claimed the No. 2 spot among Brooklyn\u2019s top deals.\nBarrett currently holds the priciest listing in Cobble Hill, a seven-bedroom townhouse at 205 Clinton Street asking $22 million. She\u2019s also bringing with her to Compass listings at 50 Bridge Park Drive, also known as Quay Tower, and 113 North 9th Street in Williamsburg.\n\u201cWe wish Lindsay the best as we continue to field calls from a high volume of agents who want to work for the only truly agent-focused luxury and independent brokerage in the nation,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nBarrett\u2019s team placed 21st among\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the top resale brokers in New York City with $78 million in sell-side sales volume. Her cohort also ranked 33rd among the leading new development agents with $58 million in closed deals.\nIn 2023, Barrett\nteamed up\nwith Maggie Marshall. Later that year, the Barton Barrett Marshall Team partnered with the Heyman Team at Sotheby\u2019s International to head sales at Fortis Property Group\u2019s Olympia Dumbo, replacing the Eklund-Gomes Team.\nMarshall and Barrett later parted ways. Marshall left Elliman to join Compass last August, as several of the brokerage\u2019s top agents, including Holly Parker and Noble Black, began departing for other firms.\nThough Elliman has lost a number of its leading brokers, the firm also nabbed its\nfirst major recruit\nlast month, when Heather Domi and her five-person team joined the fold. Domi, who was previously with Compass, is a co-founder and founding chair of the New York Residential Agent Continuum.\n",

The bayfront neighborhood is home to billionaires who include hedge funder Ken Griffin. Griffin paid nearly\n$107 million\nfor the waterfront 4-acre estate that belonged to Adrienne Arsht at 3031 and 3115 Brickell Avenue, also in Coconut Grove, in 2022.\nLast month, Mas, board chairman of the construction and engineering giant MasTec and managing owner of Inter Miami CF, sold the 7.3-acre residential lot next to the Kampong botanical garden in the Grove to a hidden buyer for\nmore than $100 million\n.\nAlso in December,\nBanyan Ridge\n, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way in Coconut Grove, traded for $101.5 million, according to the MLS. The property was most recently asking $115 million. The seller of Banyan Ridge is the estate of the late Jonathan Lewis, who was a prominent Miami restaurateur and LGBT advocate.\n",

        "content": "In Chicago\u2019s bustling multifamily market, local players are trading apartment buildings.\nThe estate of late Chicago-based investor John A Brown sold a 49-unit vintage apartment complex in Lincoln Park for $17.3 million to another Chicago-based real estate firm, Horizon Realty Group, according to a press release from Interra Realty.\nInterra\u2019s Colin O\u2019Malley represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal, which was completed in late December. The sale equates to $353,000 per unit.\nBrown was a longtime owner of the property going as far back as the 1990s, property records show. Though details of the original sale price are unclear, Brown took out a $7.3 million mortgage from Citibank on the property in 2007 and later refinanced it for $9.3 million in 2022, records show.\nThe courtyard-style building, built in 1915,\u00a0 includes seven studios, seven one-bedroom units, 31 two-bedroom and three three-bedroom units and one four-bedroom unit.\nThe sale price highlights\nthe strength of Chicago\u2019s multifamily market in 2025\n, particularly among\nmid-market properties\n.\nWhile Chicago deals with challenging market conditions ranging from an\nunpredictable property tax system\n,\na progressive city council\nand high interest rates,\nlocal buyers and sellers have an edge\nin navigating those obstacles.\nAt the same time, developers from Chicago and elsewhere have struggled to secure financing from hesitant lenders, resulting in\na historically low pipeline\nof new multifamily construction. Those same lenders are also often needed to back mortgages for some for the city\u2019s high-rises.\nAs a result, mid-market properties have found themselves in an advantageous position. Low supply has\ndriven rents up\n, and buyers have had easier access to financing for mid-range properties than for high-rises, which have\nmore often sold for less\nthan their prior price.\nInterra, which specializes in mid-market sales, recorded $111 million in multifamily transactions in 2025 on the North Side alone, according to a press release from the brokerage.\nJust down the street at 501 West Deming Place, Interra\u2019s\nO\u2019Malley brokered the sale of a 56-unit building for $19.4 million in November\n. The property was also owned by the estate of Brown, the former owner of the apartments at 506 West Deming Place. The buyers were another Chicago-based venture led by Hayes Properties.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s already protracted search for a permanent CEO just got longer.\nJillian Baldwin, one of six finalists \u2014 and the board\u2019s apparent top choice \u2014 withdrew from consideration, opting instead to remain in her current role leading the housing authority in Bridgeport, Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Post. The Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\nthat Baldwin decided to stay after negotiating with city leaders there, and she declined to comment when reached by the outlet.\nThe exit sends CHA back to the drawing board nearly after former CEO Tracey Scott\nresigned\non Nov. 1, 2024. At the time, the authority said it expected to name a successor by summer 2025. The job remains unfilled, with no clear timeline for resolution.\nBaldwin\u2019s departure is notable not just for the delay it causes, but for what it says about the job itself. Baldwin earns about $300,000 in Bridgeport, roughly in line with what she would have made in Chicago. Scott\u2019s salary was around $311,000 when she left. Compensation, at least on paper, wasn\u2019t the sticking point.\nCHA board member and resident Francine Washington told the outlet that Baldwin was the board\u2019s No. 1 candidate, and that residents cannot wait any longer.\nInstead, the authority remains mired in\ngovernance turmoil\nand a\npublic standoff\nwith the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Much of that conflict centers on retired Alderman Walter Burnett, Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s preferred candidate for the job.\nBurnett, one of the\noriginal finalists\n, cannot currently be considered because CHA lacks HUD-approved conflict of interest waivers. Those waivers are tied to Burnett\u2019s three decades on City Council and his longstanding role as a landlord to CHA voucher holders. Burnett and his wife have collected more than $260,000 since 2007 from CHA-backed rents.\nThe waiver process stalled during last year\u2019s government shutdown and is now awaiting a final determination from HUD\u2019s Washington headquarters, according to a HUD official. CHA resident leaders have vocally opposed Burnett\u2019s candidacy, arguing he is out of touch with public housing tenants \u2014 a charge Burnett disputes.\nBurnett has taken his case public, recently urging supporters on Facebook to send prewritten letters to HUD Secretary Scott Turner backing his candidacy. His wife, Darlena Williams-Burnett, also weighed in online. She previously resigned from CHA after being found to have violated the agency\u2019s ethics policy, the Chicago Tribune reported.\nOther candidates have thinned out, according to the Sun-Times. Keith Pettigrew of the District of Columbia Housing Authority has withdrawn. Eugene Jones Jr., CHA\u2019s CEO until 2019, remains in the mix, as does Gregg Fortner, formerly of the Anniston Housing Authority in Alabama.\nWhoever eventually takes the job will inherit oversight of 65,000 households, more than 21,000 units and a $1.4 billion budget \u2014 and an agency running out of patience. The CHA board meets next on Jan. 20.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Gencom and\nHersha\ndeclined to comment on the sale price, which was not recorded in a public deed.\nGencom financed the purchase with a $12 million loan from Banco Inbursa, records show.\nRitz-Carlton Coconut Grove consists of two 21-story towers completed in 2002 that also include 87 condo units owned by individual investors and 30,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor meeting space. Amenities include a pool, restaurant, spa, salon and fitness center.\nGencom purchased the hotel portion in 2011 for $10.2 million, records show. Six years later, the firm entered into a partnership with Hersha that acquired the hotel for\n$36 million\n.\nGencom and Hersha renovated the rooms, the lobby and the pool, as well as opening Isabelle\u2019s Coconut Grove restaurant in 2018.\nCoconut Grove real estate development is experiencing a revival with a handful of projects in the pipeline, including Ziggurat, a planned mixed-use project by Coral Gables-based Allen Morris Company that recently secured a\n$138.5 million\nconstruction loan. Last year, Venezuelan developer SSA Group launched sales for\nRoble One\n, a planned three-story, short-term rental friendly condo project with 16 units.\nFounded more than 40 years ago, Gencom controls a global portfolio of luxury hotels, resorts and branded residential properties with nearly $8 billion in assets under management. Through its affiliates, including Pyramid Global Hospitality and Convene, the firm is tied to more than 50,000 hotel keys and over 2 million square feet of meeting and flexible office space worldwide, the release states.\nLast month, Gencom partnered with Highgate and Argent Ventures to buy the InterContinental New York Times Square, a 607-room hotel in Manhattan, for\n$230 million\n.\nAnd last year, Gencom joined forces with Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Miami-based Fortune International Group to combine and renovate two Key Biscayne waterfront sites, consisting of a Ritz-Carlton hotel and the Grand Bay Club. A Gencom affiliate, which owns the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne, paid $20 million for Grand Bay Club, a 14,500-square-foot private beach club on 2.4 acres.\nThe firm and Fortune refinanced a\n$210 million\nloan with New York-based Blackstone, and increased the mortgage by $100 million. The new funds will be used to renovate the two properties.",

The deal and project are subject to final zoning approvals, but the club aims to break ground this spring and relocate next year from its longtime training base at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview.\nIf completed, the\nBannockburn\nproject would be the largest capital investment in the Stars\u2019 history since the franchise was founded in 2007, a demonstration of how quickly the economics of women\u2019s professional sports \u2014 and the real estate that supports them \u2014 are changing.\nThe National Women\u2019s Soccer League has benefited from a new media rights deal, growing sponsorship revenue and a landmark milestone in 2024, when Kansas City opened the first privately financed stadium built specifically for a women\u2019s pro team. Against that backdrop, Chicago Cubs co-owner\nLaura Ricketts\nbought the Stars in 2023 for $35.5 million with an all-female ownership group and has pushed to upgrade the club\u2019s infrastructure.\nThe\nBannockburn\nplan calls for reusing a vacant 56,732-square-foot former Walgreens customer support center along the Tri-State Tollway. Designed with the Ricketts family\u2019s Marquee Development and architecture firm Populous, the complex would feature two full-size soccer fields, a goalkeeper-specific pitch and roughly 45,000 square feet of training and\noffice space\n, according to the publication. One field would be enclosed by an air-supported dome, allowing year-round use and doubling as a high-visibility billboard for the club along I-94.\nStars President Karen Leetzow told the outlet that the team scouted sites across the region to escape what she described as \u201csubstandard\u201d conditions in Bridgeview. While the Stars no longer share SeatGeek Stadium with the Chicago Fire, they still face limited access and field wear from other tenants, she said.\nThe project\u2019s total cost is expected to land between $30 million and $40 million, including the purchase price. The property has been marketed for just under $7 million, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. It\u2019s owned by a venture tied to Miami-based L2B Invest, which bought it in 2015 for $11 million, records show.\nThe Stars plan to fund the project privately, though Leetzow said the club will continue to pursue public funding opportunities down the road \u2014 particularly if Illinois backs stadium projects for men\u2019s teams like the Bears or White Sox.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The purchase price and buyer\u2019s identity were not disclosed.\nWhile the land is coming under new ownership, Saks Global will still own the 200,000-square foot building and has inked a long-term lease deal for the Neiman Marcus store with the property\u2019s unnamed new owner. \u201cThis opportunistic real estate transaction does not impact our day-to-day operations,\u201d a spokesperson told the Chronicle.\nThe lease agreement for the Neiman Marcus store, completed last month, is for 99 years. Saks Global separated the land from the building lease last month \u2014 a move that could provide additional security to the buyer should Saks Global file for bankruptcy, as is expected according to reports this week. Documents linked to the transfer placed the building\u2019s market value at $160 million, down from its assessed market value in fiscal year 2024-2025 of $216.8 million.\n\u201cInvestors want future income stability, and financially troubled tenants can choose to separately sell the land beneath a building, and lease it back,\u201d Charles McCabe of San Francisco Capital Advisors told the Chronicle. \u201cThis safeguards the lease\u2019s income with the building\u2019s value, in addition to the corporate guarantee.\u201d\nSaks Global missed an interest payment of over $100 million due on its bonds on Dec. 30 and is reportedly in discussions with creditors to secure financing to navigate the bankruptcy process, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. On Jan. 2, Saks Global CEO\nMarc Metrick stepped down\nahead of the looming bankruptcy.\nThe land sale is the second recent case of Saks Global selling land beneath a Neiman Marcus store.\nLast month,\nAshkenazy Acquisition purchased\nthe land occupied by a Neiman Marcus building in Beverly Hills for an undisclosed amount. Similar to the Union Square deal, that Neiman Marcus location will still operate as a tenant under a long-term lease with Ashkenazy while Saks Global continues to own the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The pair pleaded guilty over a year ago to a\nmortgage fraud scheme\nin which they obtained an inflated loan for a 976-unit rental property in Cincinnati.\nA lawyer for Silber and Schulman argued the duo did not owe any restitution to JLL, claiming that employees of the lender were well aware of the fraud.\nThe defendants pleaded guilty in 2024 to a conspiracy to commit wire fraud charge and were sentenced earlier this year.\nBut how much they owed was undetermined, and the sides had vastly different numbers in mind. In December 2025, prosecutors argued the number should be $30 million. Silber and Schulman\u2019s side said JLL should be awarded no restitution.\n\u201cHigh ranking executives of JLL were complicit in, and facilitated, the Cincinnati fraudulent loan transactions,\u201d Silber and Schulman\u2019s attorneys wrote in a filing. \u201cAs a result, JLL is precluded from asserting that it was a \u201cvictim\u201d of the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d\nU.S. District Court Judge Robert Kirsch of New Jersey did not buy this argument. \u201c[T]o make such a finding that would resolve defendants of their substantial restitution obligations,\u201d he wrote in a 25-page ruling in late December.\nSilber and Schulman\u2019s case was among the first in a\nbroader crackdown on commercial mortgage fraud\nby the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Silber, Schulman and their co-conspirator, Boruch Drillman, embarked on a scheme in 2019 to buy an apartment complex for $70 million before using a stolen identity to essentially \u201cflip\u201d the property to themselves for $96 million.\nThe higher purchase price served as a key metric to secure a $74 million loan from JLL, which then sold the loan to Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored agency that buys loans from private lenders.\nThe true victim\nThe two sides bickered over where to pin blame.\nJLL was not a victim of the fraud, lawyer Jerome Ballarotto argued on behalf of Silber and Schulman.\nJLL repurchased the loan from Fannie Mae in 2024 for $81 million, the defense argued, knowing it would result in a significant loss, for two reasons: JLL had to repair its relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the firm became aware that two executives handling the loan were complicit in the fraud.\nBut Silber and Schulman failed to provide any documentation backing these claims, Kirsch said, and there was no indication that the two JLL executives were ever investigated by law enforcement over the Cincinnati transaction.\nIn his ruling, Kirsch deemed the true victim of the fraud to be Fannie Mae. He said JLL was not a victim since it repurchased the loan from Fannie Mae knowing the loan was in distress and the property was in disrepair.\nKirsch said JLL could still be awarded restitution because it compensated the true victim, Fannie Mae, for its loss by purchasing the loan.\nThe restitution came down to $21.7 million after fees, escrow money paid and the sale of the property for $60 million.\nThe elder investor\nSchulman had argued that if the judge did award restitution, he should pay much less.\nKirsch had gone easier on Schulman at the sentencing hearing in March 2025, allowing him to self-surrender and sentencing him to just one year in prison. (Drillman was given no prison time. Silber was sentenced to 30 months in prison, but was\nmoved to a halfway house\nin December just nine months into his sentence.)\nThis time, Kirsch was not sympathetic to Schulman, who is in his 70s.\nKirsch noted that Schulman was a lawyer, banker and venture capitalist who built a successful career and had claimed to be a mentor and father figure to Silber, who was nearly four decades younger.\n\u201cDespite \u2018clearly being the adult\u2019 in that relationship and well versed in the fields of law and finance, Schulman did not use his fatherly role and wealth of experience to advise Silber,\u201d Kirsch said.\nInstead, he undertook an \u201cactive and integral\u201d role in the fraud, Kirsch added.\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Kirsch allowed Schulman to surrender to prison based on certain upcoming family responsibilities, including taking care of his ailing wife.\nBut the federal judge noted in his ruling that Schulman took advantage of the court\u2019s generous spirit\u2026 \u201cover and over and over again\u201d by frequently traveling to the Hamptons instead of finding care for his ailing wife.\nSchulman and Silber\u2019s lawyer did not return a request for comment. JLL also did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A spike in insurance premiums is a big reason operating costs have shot up. But why did that happen?\nA prime suspect is bogus litigation, which some multifamily owners say insurers too often settle rather than fight.\nThey point to trip-and-fall lawsuits in which insurers caved despite video evidence proving that the accidents were fake, or that the person who fell in the stairwell was typing furiously on his cellphone rather than watching his step.\nWill the government come to the rescue? Might Zohran Mamdani prod the City Council or state to offer a low-cost insurance product, allowing owners to pour the savings back into their buildings?\nThe government does provide flood insurance and (after 9/11) terrorism insurance. But nobody can fake a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.\nFor standard liability policies, the government would not be any better at handling fraudulent claims, and probably worse. It seems to me that it would have even less incentive than private insurers to litigate rather than settle.\nHistory offers a clue. When Mike Bloomberg became mayor, he was faced with a large budget deficit and responded by raising property taxes 18 percent \u2014 which made him immediately unpopular. But then he set about cutting spending.\nOne way he did that was by\nshifting responsibility\nfor sidewalk maintenance to property owners in 2003. It wasn\u2019t just to save money on repairs. Rather, the city was getting hammered by trip-and-fall lawsuits. Now, property owners do.\nThe city did exempt one-, two- and three-family, owner-occupied homes from\nliability\nbecause those owners have less financial capacity (and also tend to be prime voters).\nThe 2003 shift wasn\u2019t exactly an innovative solution to rising lawsuit expenses. And it suggests that the government is not likely to take any responsibility back, even by offering a reinsurance product as a backstop for carriers.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill multifamily owners view Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\nas antisemitic? New York City landlords are disproportionately Jewish, and so far only landlords have been targeted by Mamdani for public hearings. One will be held in each borough.\nIt is true that housing is New Yorkers\u2019 greatest expense and that two-thirds of city residents are renters. So it\u2019s a logical place to begin the push for affordability on which Mamdani campaigned.\nHowever, many Jews in the industry were already on edge about Mamdani, and reacted negatively when he rescinded two executive orders by his predecessor, Eric Adams. One equated some criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews and the other banned city agencies from boycotting Israel, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Of the 47,000 planned housing units that don\u2019t have building permits, 31 percent are in filings from more than five years ago, \u201cwhich means they are likely stalled or may never begin construction,\u201d according to a Real Estate Board of New York\nreport\n.\nThe least productive of the 51 City Council districts is represented by Julie Menin, the new speaker. Her East Side district has\nnegative\nnine units in pre-development: More are slated to be lost through demolition, consolidation or use changes than created. However, in terms of units under construction, it ranks in the middle of the pack with 961.\nElsewhere\u2026\nOne of the best economics podcasts has shut down, but not before leaving real estate geeks with a final nugget of wisdom.\nThe 118th episode of The Economics of Everyday Things looked at\nurban trees\n, which significantly benefit not only the environment and human health but also real estate.\nA 2007 study in East Portland found that a single tree in front of a home raised that home\u2019s sales price by more than $7,000 and the value of homes within a 100-foot radius by a total of $13,000.\nAs a result, Portland\u2019s street trees were increasing property tax revenues by $15.3 million a year, about 5 times more than homeowners spent to maintain them.\nThe same researcher found that Sacramento shade trees reduced a home\u2019s electric bill by an average of $25 during summer months.\nAnother survey found trees benefit retail real estate, as shoppers judge merchants on tree-lined streets to be more knowledgeable and pleasant and said they would spend 9 percent to 15 percent more in retail areas with a nice canopy.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$10 million\nfor a 3,984-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 85 Worth Street in Tribeca. The Eklund Gomes Team with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$55 million\nfor the Woodcrest Rehab &amp; Residential Health Care Center property at 119-09 26th Avenue in College Point. An entity tied to Jacob Sod purchased it from Jack Deutsch.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$14 million\nfor a 4,315-square-foot condominium unit at 459 West Broadway in Soho. Kristina Paces with Serhant has\nthe listing\n.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The proposal also promised to fill the void left by the hospital\u2019s closure with a new grocer, medical offices and a 23-room hotel for visiting families.\nBut Lockwood defaulted on $44.2 million in debt tied to the project, according to a foreclosure complaint filed by a lender last month in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThe developer\u2019s financial problems aren\u2019t confined to Chicago\u2019s south suburbs, court documents show. The Blue Island foreclosure is one of at least seven simultaneous alleged defaults totaling $178 million in troubled debt owed by Lockwood, exposing a portfolio-wide collapse for the firm led by\nCharles Everhardt\nand Edward Dovner.\n\u201cWe are doing a sale of all assets to a third party which the lender has approved,\u201d Everhardt said. He claimed the sale price will be more than the debt Lockwood owes.\nThe firm\u2019s hotel portfolio, including properties in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee and elsewhere, is being sold as a package to one buyer, while the Blue Island property is being sold separately to a data center developer, Everhardt said in an interview.\nHowever, he said he was unable to name the buyers or disclose exact pricing due to an agreement with the lender; the lawsuit doesn\u2019t mention a sale. \u201cThe foreclosure, as I understand, will be dismissed,\u201d he said.\nBlue Island city officials didn\u2019t return requests for comment. But Everhardt said data center development is the \u201chighest and best use\u201d for the former healthcare site.\n\u201cThere is fiber that runs across the railroad tracks adjacent to the property. And we have been able to secure a power solution,\u201d he said.\nThe lender pursuing foreclosure is an affiliate of Puyallup, Washington-based\nBuilders Capital\n, which originated nearly $32 million in loans to Lockwood\u2019s Blue Island project in 2022. Builders Capital later provided a second mortgage of more than $15 million to the project in 2024, but now almost all of the principal remains outstanding and is well past maturity, records show.\nAn attorney for Builders declined to comment.\nCapital Crunch\nBuilders, in its Dec. 19 complaint, claims Lockwood failed to pay off the principal balance by the loan\u2019s extended maturity date of March 31, 2025. The lender also accuses Lockwood of allowing unauthorized liens to pile up against the property, constituting additional violations of the loan agreement.\nThe suit marks a reversal of fortunes for a project that appeared to be finding its footing just over a year ago. In September 2024, Lockwood reportedly paid nearly $137,000 in outstanding bills to the city of Blue Island to settle code violations and clear the path for permits. At the time, city officials expressed cautious optimism that the delayed redevelopment was moving a step closer to reality.\nInstead, the project appears to have hit a financial wall.\nThe lender claims six other Lockwood loans are also in default.\nBlue Island, Illinois: $31.9 million original principal (now $44.2M due)\nMemphis, Tennessee: $28.9 million loan\nTulsa, Oklahoma: $28.9 million loan\nOrlando, Florida: $25.6 million loan\nDayton, Ohio: $23.5 million loan\nWyomissing, Pennsylvania: $21.3 million loan\nMarietta, Georgia: $17.8 million loan\nMost of these loans, like the Blue Island debt, matured in March 2025, according to legal documents. The Tulsa, Orlando, Dayton and Marietta loans appear to be for hotel properties Lockwood lists on its website\u2019s portfolio page. The Pennsylvania property is encountering similar issues to the Blue Island project, according to a September\nreport by SpotlightPA.org\n.\nLocal officials there moved to seize the vacant site via eminent domain in 2025, but a county committee voted in November to remove the property\u2019s \u201cblighted\u201d designation after ownership promised to install HVAC units to prevent the sprinkler system from freezing, according to the publication. The reprieve came despite objections from Wyomissing officials, who argued the long-shuttered hotel remained a safety hazard.\nIn Blue Island, the road to revamping the MetroSouth site has been rocky from the start, also plagued by delays and friction with city officials over property maintenance.The lender is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take immediate control of the Blue Island property and is pursuing a deficiency judgment against Everhardt and Dovner personally, alleging they waived their \u201cright of redemption\u201d \u2014 a move that could fast-track the property to a judicial sale. The foreclosure lawsuit is scheduled for a June 22 case management hearing, online court records show.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s office market in 2025 topped a benchmark it hadn\u2019t touched since the pandemic cratered demand.\nTenants leased 10.3 million square feet of office space in downtown Chicago last year compared to an alltime low of 5.5 million square feet leased in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, historic data from Savills indicates. The 10 million square feet threshold hadn\u2019t been surpassed since 2019 until last year, according to a report from Savills rounding out 2025.\nData collected since 2020 shows leasing has inched upward each year, with 2025 coming closest to pre-pandemic leasing levels so far. In 2019, tenants leased 13 million square feet of office space in the central business district.\nThe progress is good news for\nthe beleaguered Loop\n.\nThe top office leasing transaction recorded by Savills in the last quarter of 2025 was the renewal and expansion of law firm\nBenesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff\u2019s 130,000-square-foot\ndeal in Irvine Company\u2019s building at 71 South Wacker Drive. The law firm\u2019s lease grew by 33,000 in the new deal.\nAnother law firm, Ropes &amp; Gray,\nexpanded its space to 105,000 square feet\nat 191 North Wacker Drive, which is owned by Manulife. It previously occupied about 79,000 square feet in the building.\nStill, office landlords are hardly in the clear. Out of the full inventory of downtown office space, about 29.5 percent is available for rent. The percentage stayed nearly stagnant from 2024, when it came in at 29.4 percent, according to Savills.\nAnd\nforeclosure lawsuits continued to play out\namong big-name building owners and lenders in 2025, including landlord AmTrust and special servicer LNR Partners over the Illinois Center.\nLNR Partners\nfiled to foreclose\non the New York-based landlord\u2019s $260 million loan for the two-tower property at 111 East Wacker Drive and 233 North Michigan Avenue in 2024 and the legal dispute over the property is still ongoing.\nTrouble started when\nThe U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services vacated 170,000 square feet\nin 2023, leaving a hole in the 2.1 million-square-foot complex.\nSavills notes, however, that overall trends paint a better picture for the year ahead.\nAsking rents increased 5.1 percent year-over-year to $47.08 per square foot, with Class A rents rising to $55.23 per square foot.\nMeanwhile,\noffice-to-residential conversions\nare getting underway\nwith support from the city\n, helping to chip away at the glut of available workspace.\n",

        "content": "Matt Garrison isn\u2019t backing away from Chicago\u2019s distressed loft office market.\nHis Chicago-based firm R2 Cos. added another distressed River North loft to its portfolio.\nThe firm purchased the building at 225 West Illinois Street in late December, according to a social media post from R2 partner Zack Cupkovic.\nR2 paid $4.65 million for the 46,150-square-foot, five story building, Garrison told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe sale comes out to about $100 per square foot.\nWhile a deed detailing the sale is not yet available, the seller appears to be a subsidiary of State Farm Life Insurance, the lender that took over the building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in October.\nThe building\u2019s previous owner, Leigh Rabman\u2019s RN Realty, surrendered the property to a subsidiary of State Farm in October, property records show. RN Realty took out an $8.5 million mortgage on the building in 2018, according to public documents.\nRabman and State Farm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe acquisition is R2\u2019s latest play into\ndowntown loft workspace\n, keeping up its bet that distressed and\ndiscounted boutique offices\nwill rebound. A venture of R2 and its Chicago-based partner Cubed Real Estate\nacquired a similar building\ntwo blocks north, at 225 West Ohio Street, out of distress in August.\nGarrison said the firm is targeting well-positioned lofts in River North and West Loop to build its portfolio. The buildings offer a low-cost way to compete with larger office towers, he said.\n\u201cThey allow us to offer smaller spaces cost effectively, and the space is interesting and feels good. More like an apartment versus a cold tower,\u201d he said. \u201cMore importantly, the cost structure of these buildings is less than half of tower economics.\u201d\nR2 has also dabbled in the distressed office tower market, however. In early 2024, it bought the\n41-story building at 150 North Michigan Avenue\nin partnership with Anagram Capital and Italy\u2019s billionaire Garavoglia family, in a deal that marked a massive drop in value for the property. R2 and its partners paid just $60 million for the property, down from more than $121 million its previous owners had paid for it in 2017 before sinking $35 million more into renovations.\nAt 225 West Illinois, R2 plans to upgrade the building\u2019s lobby and restrooms, and put money into improving the office spaces, Garrison said.\nR2\u2019s confidence in the subsector comes against the backdrop of stubbornly high\ndowntown office vacancy rates\n, especially for Class B properties like the Illinois Street loft building. Vacancy rates in the Central Business District reached 28 percent in the third quarter of 2025, according to CBRE. At Class B spaces, the rate rose to 35 percent.\nProperty records show Rabman\u2019s firm acquired the building in 2000 from a trust administered by Cole Taylor Bank. While records don\u2019t indicate a purchase price for the long ago transaction, his firm took out a $5.5 million mortgage when it purchased the building.\nThe structure, which was built in 1976, was renovated in 2000, according to property details on Loopnet.\nRN Realty refinanced the property multiple times during its ownership. It took out a $5.25 million mortgage in 2010, then a $6.25 million mortgage in 2015. The last $8.5 million mortgage with State Farm landed the building in distress and led to the lender to take back the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, prior to R2\u2019s purchase.\n",

        "content": "A long-running fight over the West Austin Business Park might transform into a dramatic reset with a high-profile winner.\nAustin-based space communications startup CesiumAstro is in talks to buy the 23-acre,\nthree-building campus\nnear State Highway 71 and Sweetwater Village Drive, with plans to convert the controversial site into its global headquarters, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The 270,000-square-foot property, known as Lot 7, sits in Bee Cave\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction and has been at the center of a\nbitter legal dispute\nfor more than a year.\nNothing is signed yet.\nCesiumAstro\nexecutives cautioned on Monday that discussions are ongoing and that no deal has been finalized.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll share updates on any expansion once details are confirmed,\u201d CFO Ken Smith told the outlet.\nStill, the city of Bee Cave has already teed up a path forward. City officials announced that CesiumAstro is poised to acquire the property from\nDallas-based Velocis\n, which had partnered with\nKBC Advisors\non the development, as part of a settlement agreement aimed at resolving the lawsuit over the project. The\nBee Cave\nCity Council unanimously voted in December to advance an updated settlement after an executive session, though the agreement has not yet appeared in court filings.\nIf completed, the sale would largely end Bee Cave\u2019s clash with Velocis \u2014 and replace a feared warehouse hub with a fast-growing aerospace employer. City officials said CesiumAstro plans to use the campus for office space and assembly of satellite communications equipment, not distribution.\nThat distinction is central to the deal. Bee Cave sued in 2024, arguing the developers violated a 2015 development agreement by pushing an industrial warehouse project incompatible with nearby residential areas. Velocis disputed those claims. Under the amended agreement, warehouse and distribution uses are barred.\nPlans call for converting 76 loading docks into windows, leaving just four truck bays. According to city documents, truck traffic would be capped at eight 18-wheelers per month, down from what could have been hundreds per day. All deliveries would require 24-hour notice to Bee Cave police and escorted truck trips. The developers also agreed to donate $500,000 to the city.\nMayor Kara King framed the settlement in a statement as a community win, saying the new agreement amounted to a \u201cbetter outcome for our community than a last mile warehouse distribution center.\u201d\nThe settlement does not resolve all legal issues. Claims tied to the project against Bee Cave\u2019s former city manager, Clint Garza, remain set for trial in February.\nThe site could anchor CesiumAstro\u2019s next growth phase. The startup raised $65 million last year, on top of a $60 million round in 2022, and has secured defense contracts with the Space Development Agency and the U.S. Air Force, according to the publication. Headcount has doubled to more than 200, and the company has been openly scouting for room to expand its Austin presence.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A longtime fixture on San Antonio\u2019s Broadway corridor could soon be wiped from the map.\nLocal developer Harper/Huddleston filed for permission to demolish the building that housed the former Antiquarian Book Mart at 3127 Broadway, according to city records. The demolition request, submitted Dec. 31, is now under review by staff in the city\u2019s Office of Historic Preservation, with a response expected in February, the San Antonio Business Journal first\nreported\n.\nThe property sits within a River Improvement Overlay district, a zoning layer intended to protect the character and development patterns along the San Antonio River. While the overlay adds scrutiny, the proposal would not automatically trigger a hearing before the Historic and Design Review Commission unless city staff determines the project warrants additional review, according to the publication.\nHarper/Huddleston bought the property in 2023 from bookstore owner Bob Kellel, ending the run of the beloved Antiquarian Book Mart. The deal also included the adjacent Half Price Books building and parking lot. Both retailers closed shortly after the sale, clearing a sizable stretch of frontage along\nBroadway\n.\nThe developer has continued to quietly assemble property in the area. In March 2024, Harper/Huddleston also acquired the neighboring building at 3125 Broadway, home to W.D. Deli. The firm did not respond to requests for comment about its plans for the sites.\nAny demolition would add to the steady churn reshaping\nLower Broadway\n, a corridor increasingly defined by redevelopment and higher-density projects. Last fall, The DoSeum purchased nearby land once occupied by Good Time Charlie\u2019s and Taco Cabana for a potential expansion. Farther up Broadway, construction is underway on the first phase of Terry Black\u2019s BBQ\u2019s\nmixed-use project\n, which includes a restaurant, a three-story hotel with a spa and an underground parking garage at 2100 Broadway Street.\nLarger projects are also in the pipeline. GrayStreet Partners and Fulcrum Development are planning the 15-acre\nBESA District\nmixed-use development in Government Hill, while Sandstone Developments recently repositioned the aging Ranch Motel into a boutique hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project is about five miles from campus.\nCollege Station-based Adam Development, led by Andrew Ball, director of real estate, and John Ben Blackburn, senior vice president, plans to start the project in March and complete it by January 2028, according to a plan filed in December with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The estimated cost amounts to $125,000 per unit, though TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nIt\u2019s the most expensive\nmultifamily\nproject on record for Bryan. It\u2019s also the most expensive plan for multifamily or student housing filed since\nTexas\nended bans on \u201cstealth dorms,\u201d as one ordinance called them. Earlier this year, the legislature passed a prohibition on relationship-based occupancy codes in college towns with populations of less than 250,000 \u2014 a law aimed squarely at College Station and Bryan, home to Texas A&amp;M University and one of its feeder schools, Blinn College.\nWith an annual enrollment exceeding 70,000 students, Texas A&amp;M has the largest in-person student body in the country. However, in the past few years, College Station and Bryan enforced occupancy restrictions that forbade more than four unrelated people to share a home outside of certain permitted neighborhoods. In College Station, the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule applied to apartments as well.\nAs part of a broader effort to free up housing supply\n, the legislature halted enforcement of these local ordinances beginning in September.\nThe end of the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule presents an opportunity to rent to more occupants \u2014 and the market shows signs that property owners are taking it.\nIn November, the latest month on record for Zillow, area rents dropped by $7, month-over-month. While only a modest decline for the average renter, it\u2019s the first time since 2016 that rents declined at all in November \u2014 a notable skip in the college town\u2019s clockwork seasonal trends.\nAdditionally, in October, the month after the law took effect, the number of rental properties in the county jumped 18 percent, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nAs a result, it\u2019s easier to fill five-bedroom or six-bedroom apartments in College Station. On the other hand, multifamily projects planned in advance of 2025 now face competition from an unleashed reserve of detached homes.\nAdam Development has owned the land slated for Copperfield Drive Apartments since 2003, according to public records. The company did not immediately respond for comment.Not long before the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule ended, Texas developer Parallel also began work on a 23-story student housing building on Boyett Street with an estimated cost of $59 million, and Subtext started on a two-phase student housing development two blocks from campus, with the estimated cost of the first phase alone exceeding $60 million.\n",

        "content": "Bank OZK has found a buyer for a nine-figure construction loan backing a mostly empty life sciences campus in Southern California.\nThe lender sold a $265 million loan tied to Pacific Center, a 500,000-square-foot property at 9955 Pacific Heights Boulevard in northwestern San Diego, to Connecticut-based private equity firm\nStrategic Value Partners\n, Bisnow\nreported\n. Bank OZK\u2019s sale marks one of the largest whole-loan dispositions in the Arkansas-based bank\u2019s history. Though the loan is valued at $265 million, the exact amount Strategic Value Partners paid to acquire the debt package was not disclosed.\nChicago-based Sterling Bay completed development on the property last May. A joint venture between Sterling Bay and\nHarrison Street Real Estate\nsecured the loan in 2023 for the first phase of Pacific Center\u2019s construction, comprising two six-story buildings, an amenity center and a parking garage. A dearth of life sciences tenants as\nfederal funds \u2014 and tenant demand for space \u2014 dry up\nhas left the campus largely vacant. Several 37,000-square-foot suites are available for immediate occupancy, according to\nLoopNet\n.\nThe sale represents the latest time Bank OZK has seen a loan with Sterling Bay go south. In 2019, the bank provided the developer with a $128 million mortgage for land at the Lincoln Yards megaproject in Chicago, but seized the property last March\nfollowing the project\u2019s collapse\n. The parcel was sold\nto JDL Development\nin October for roughly $84 million, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nPacific Center is in San Diego\u2019s Sorrento Mesa neighborhood, a life sciences hub in the city. More than 3 million square feet of life sciences space was available for rent at the end of the third quarter, representing about 40 percent of the market\u2019s entire inventory and more than any other neighborhood in San Diego, per CBRE data cited by Bisnow. The vacancy rate in the area was 35 percent at the end of the third quarter, well above the 23 percent average across all of San Diego\u2019s core markets.\nElsewhere in Sorrento Mesa, Bank OZK also provided Longfellow Real Estate Partners with a $202 million construction loan to build the 316,000-square-foot Bioterra life sciences property in 2022. The Bioterra development, like Pacific Center, is also facing vacancy and loan distress, per Bisnow.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s Thursday: Caravan day for agents in Altadena and Southern California\u2019s broader Foothills.\nAgents, who were out for a day of new listing previews, chatted over coffee at a cul-de-sac where a nearly finished home, expected to be the first developer-completed residence in Altadena early this year, was the draw.\nCompass agents Jeff Salcido and Mark Marquez hold the listing, at 3245 Arrowhead Court. It\u2019s priced just under $1.9 million and is one of 15 Altadena residences to be built by the developer New Pointe Communities.\nSalcido\u2019s brother and sister-in-law once lived there. But in April, they decided to sell the lot to New Pointe for $635,000.\n\u201cThey had a baby on the way, and trying to have your first baby, rebuilding and going through the whole process was just a bit more than they wanted to take on,\u201d Salcido said. \u201cFor them, it was a really hard decision.\u201d\nAside from the backstory, and the fact that the neighboring properties are dirt lots, burned by last January\u2019s Eaton Fire, the agent gathering would have been unremarkable.\nBut those lots are now primed for rebuilding, a sign of the effort that has gone into the recovery\nsince the\nPalisades and Eaton fires destroyed a combined 16,000 single-family and commercial structures a year ago.\nNow, green shoots are turning into a broader comeback, as real estate surveys the progress \u2014 what\u2019s sold and what\u2019s being built \u2014 and property owners make their own decisions to move forward on new homes, or move away. So far, the permitting pipeline is in sync with that activity, and developers are keeping up, although some wonder what 2026 holds, as the pace picks up.\nNearly 3,600 residential properties in the Eaton and\nPalisades\nfires\u2019 burn zones have already filed for permits related to rebuilding between Feb. 1 and Dec. 8,\u00a0 according to an analysis of Los Angeles County data by\nTRD\nData.\n\u201cIt could be a 1,000-square-foot cottage or an 8,000-square-foot architecturally significant home, as long as there are no conflicts to code and everything\u2019s buttoned up, you\u2019re going to get approval.\u201d\nMatt McRoskey, steel framing supplier\nAltadena appears to be moving at a faster clip, accounting for 40 percent of the total properties seeking permits. Pacific Palisades accounts for 15 percent, while Malibu is 9 percent, according to\nTRD\nData.\nClosings offer another view of what\u2019s moving and for how much. Market watchers are waiting for land sales to bottom out and an upward trajectory in values to become clear.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Malibu lays claim to the priciest lot sale post-fires, according to a review of Zillow records. The deal, one-third of an acre at Carbon Beach, closed in August for $14 million; it\u2019s located at\n22102 Pacific Coast Highway\n. At one time, it held a nearly 5,000-square-foot home with 60 feet fronting the ocean.\nThe Palisades\u2019 priciest lot sale since the fires, 1511 Old Oak Road, closed in September for $9.4 million.\nBuyers can get more for their money in Altadena, where the community\u2019s priciest lot sale was in November for $2.1 million. The nearly 1-acre lot at 1625 Braeburn Road sits just above the Altadena Golf Course in the Country Club neighborhood.\nP\nermit prognosis\nSpreadsheets alone suggest a seemingly daunting multi-year construction process: If some Woolsey Fire residents in Malibu are only just now moving into their rebuilt homes, seven years after that blaze, what\u2019s in store for Palisades and Eaton survivors?\nAt the heart of that answer is whether the expedited permitting process promised post-fires is working. By all accounts, it\u2019s so far, so good \u2014 despite some very loud criticisms of bureaucratic inertia in various aspects of the recovery.\nDeveloper Rick Caruso has been unfiltered in his critiques, but on a Friday in December, he was nothing but smiles and praise for Thomas James Homes executives celebrating the completion of their first Palisades rebuild at 915 Kagawa Street, which is partially the result of an expedited permitting process.\nThe developer \u2014 dressed in a crisp white shirt under a navy blazer, black slacks and double-monk strap shoes \u2014 was on site to lend his support to the project, a Thomas James Homes spokesperson said.\nSome in the rebuild effort qualify the critiques with the reality that construction simply takes time. In Malibu and certain parts of the Palisades, rocky hillsides, sandy beaches and other challenging terrain can tack more time onto a project than you\u2019d need with simple, flat lots. That\u2019s on top of the human element, where many homeowners have only reached the point, a year later, where they\u2019re ready for the design phase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very early in the Palisades,\u201d Matt McRoskey, founder of steel framing supplier Ghost Factory, said. \u201cA lot of folks needed to take some time. They needed six months to land their long-term rental, to get their inventory lists and they weren\u2019t even thinking about hiring architects for the first six to 12 months. But now they\u2019re ready.\u201d\nGhost Factory\u2019s steel is forming the new bones for entrepreneur Lisa Price\u2019s home at 854 Galloway Street, about three blocks away from the Kagawa Street property.\nMcRoskey came into the project after Price had already pulled a permit to build with wood. His firm had to apply for a supplemental permit for the change.\nThe application was 300 pages of engineering calculations, followed by a 30-minute in-person meeting at the permit office. Ghost Factory warned Price that approval might take weeks, or even months.\nInstead, the office granted the change in seven days, according to McRoskey who has since submitted plans for two other homes, including a 2,500-square-foot home along Sunset Boulevard in the Palisades\u2019 Huntington neighborhood and an over 4,000-square-foot property near Palisades Charter High School.\nMcRoskey, who grew up in the Palisades, said his parents and other relatives in the community are in talks with architects and will eventually turn to Ghost Factory once their designs advance.\nHe finds the permit system is working well, regardless of a project\u2019s size or complexity.\n\u201cIt could be a 1,000-square-foot cottage or an 8,000-square-foot architecturally significant home, as long as there are no conflicts to code and everything\u2019s buttoned up, you\u2019re going to get approval,\u201d he said.\nIn many instances, he pointed out, delays can be self-inflicted, since an understaffed L.A. Department of Building and Safety is not new.\nThomas James Homes CEO James Mead touted his firm\u2019s efficient permitting record to press outside his company\u2019s Kagawa Street property. Its average permitting time with the city of Los Angeles is less than 60 days.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t entirely about a streamlined process,\u201d Mead said. \u201cI think the city is really trying hard. It\u2019s about what you can do if you\u2019ve got a professional approach to permitting.\u201d\nNew Pointe founder and President Scot Sandstrom said about as much in the case of Altadena, where permitting is done through L.A. County. While the typical permit process is a year, the Arrowhead Court property that brought the Compass caravan out in December was permitted in four months.\nSandstrom said he has nothing but praise for the county, despite some of the negative chatter.\n\u201cI understand for people who have never built a home, how it can be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cHomes are complex.\u201d\nThe unknown now is whether the system can support the expected flood of permits this year.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s going to start getting extremely busy in the first half of 2026 and it will be interesting to see how the city reacts,\u201d McRoskey said. \u201cThe department will get absolutely flooded at some point.\u201d\nL\narge or small\nIf anyone was keeping score on first completions in the burn zones, it would seem the larger developers have command of the race.\nThose firms would argue that\u2019s where their building expertise shines.\nIn Thomas James Homes\u2019 case, Mead touted the company\u2019s single-lot experience. That is, its skill in building individual homes as opposed to tract housing in master-planned communities.\nThe CEO estimated the company could be under construction on more than 100 homes next year, with the bulk of that work done as early as the end of 2026. It\u2019s promising a starting price of $650 per square foot in construction costs.\nMany rebuilding with other developers have said quotes are well above $1,000 per square foot, as materials sourcing and supply chains lurch under the strain of tariffs, increased demand and other factors.\nAt New Pointe, the company has the added experience of rebuilding post-fires, going back to San Diego County\u2019s Witch Creek Fire. Those flames broke out in October 2007 and burned more than 1,000 homes.\nNew Pointe initially bought 16 lots in six neighborhoods after the fires and rebuilt those properties.\nNow, it\u2019s doing the same in Altadena, purchasing lots from homeowners like Salcido\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, who are unable to move forward with rebuilding.\nIt\u2019s a touchy subject, given the negative pall cast around\ncorporates\nbuying lots across the burn zones.\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for both,\u201d Sandstrom said of the role of large homebuilders and individual homeowners in a speedy recovery. \u201cThere are 4,000 homes here that need to be rebuilt. We need everybody to be a part of it. Not just homeowners rebuilding or builders rebuilding.\u201d",

        "content": "Almost two years after\nbeing indicted\n, Omnibuild and its former CEO John Mingione are finally nearing a trial date for their alleged roles in a $86 million fraud scheme.\nThe New York construction firm and Mingione reached a tentative agreement with the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office for a trial in April, which could last six to eight weeks.\nProsecutors said they recently completed their discovery, consisting of at least 470,000 documents.\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019re ready to go to trial,\u201d said Christopher Beard, an assistant District Attorney, during a hearing in front of Judge Ann Thompson in December.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office alleged in early 2024 that Mingione and Omnibuild participated in a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme spearheaded by former HFZ Capital Group executive Nir Meir to inflate invoices at the XI, a twisting condo project on the High Line. The D.A.\u2019s office charged Omnibuild and Mingione with grand larceny.\nBut since the start, Mingione and Omnibuild have maintained their innocence. They argued they were victims of the Meir and HFZ Capital\u2019s bad acts. (Kevin Stewart, a former accountant at Omnibuild, was also charged for his role in the scheme.)\n\u201cOmnibuild voluntarily assisted the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for months,\u201d said Omnibuild\u2019s civil attorney John Ruggiero. \u201cDespite that good-faith cooperation, and correspondence from the District Attorney\u2019s office confirming Omnibuild\u2019s status as a victim, the District Attorney\u2019s office ultimately chose to rely on a small number of self-interested cooperators who sought to avoid prosecution by shifting blame onto Omnibuild and Mr. Mingione.\u201d\nRuggiero also said the District Attorney\u2019s office has excluded \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d from its discovery production.\nThe D.A.\u2019s office said in a response that it \u201cwill respond to any defense motions in court filings.\u201d\nMingione and Omnibuild were eager to set a trial date. Omnibuild\u2019s criminal defense attorney Eric Snyder said the company\u2019s stock option plan has dropped to a fraction of its former value.\n\u201cThe company can\u2019t get jobs. They can\u2019t work. HPD [Housing Preservation Department] is holding up their work,\u201d said Snyder at the hearing in December. \u201cIt\u2019s destructive, it\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s choking off the company of these employees.\u201d\nIn 2024, Omnibuild\u2019s\nemployees claimed\nthat the indictment alone led to $1 billion in losses.\nSnyder pleaded with the court to hold the April trial date in place.\n\u201cWe want to keep this date. If it moves again, it\u2019s going to be the company dying on the vine,\u201d he said.\nThe case has dragged on since February 2024, when the charges were first announced against Meir, Mingione, Stewart, Omnibuild, HFZ, a former Omnibuild employee and two former HFZ employees.\nProsecutors leveled the most serious charges against Meir. The D.A.\u2019s office alleged Meir diverted millions of dollars from HFZ\u2019s real estate projects only to return the money with sizable shortfalls. Meir was also accused of defrauding New York City out of $15 million in taxes.\nMeir was fired from luxury real estate developer HFZ in December 2020, as the firm was\nlosing its high-profile projects\nto foreclosure. Meir\u2019s former boss Ziel Feldman blamed Meir for the firm\u2019s collapse in a scathing lawsuit. As Meir fended off lawsuits from HFZ creditors, he hunkered down in a Miami Beach estate, paying $150,000 per month in rent, until he was arrested in a hotel room at the 1 Hotel South Beach and extradited to New York in February 2024.\nMeir, who has pleaded not guilty, is now on his third attorney.\nHe was initially held without bail and held on Rikers Island for nearly a year before being released in March 2025 on a reduced bail package of $1 million. Just weeks later the judge claimed Meir violated the terms of his bail and sent him back to jail.\nMeir was released in June, but with electronic monitoring and restricted to the confines of a New York apartment.\nMeanwhile, HFZ Capital, two of its former employees, including their head of construction, and a former Omnibuild employee have pleaded guilty to various charges. None of the defendants who pleaded guilty were given jail sentences.\nAt the December hearing, the D.A\u2019s office said it has sent over a certificate of compliance to Meir\u2019s lawyer for his four indictments, meaning the prosecutors have provided all discovery and a trial date appears imminent.\nMeir will be tried separately from Omnibuild and Mingione.\nAt the end of the December hearing with Omnibuild and Mingione\u2019s lawyers present, the judge suggested the parties look at an alternative resolution other than a trial.\n\u201cI will always encourage a disposition, if there\u2019s any way toward a disposition\u2026 in much the way\u2026 that we ask jurors to consider the views of their fellow jurors, and don\u2019t be so wedded to their position, I ask that of all of you,\u201d said Thompson.\n",

Bayview PACE\u2019s recent deals include\n$180 million in C-PACE\ndebt provided for North Development\u2019s Domus Brickell Center.\nOkan, a planned 70-story mixed-use high-rise at 555 North Miami Avenue, is on the 40th floor of construction. The building will be 903 feet tall once completed in 2028, according to a news release. When completed, Okan Tower will include a 316-key Hilton hotel, 236 condo-hotel units managed by Hilton, 163 condos, more than 80,000 square feet of amenities and 56,000 square feet of office space.\nMichael Sadov of Fortune Development Sales is leading sales of the project.

        "content": "A 1920s-built,\nBel-Air\nestate designed by the same architect behind the Beverly Hills Hotel led the pack of last week\u2019s signed contracts kicking off the new year.\nThe home at 259 Saint Pierre Road sat in the top spot on the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfor the seven-day period ended Jan. 4. The\nweekly roundup\nis produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team and includes properties within L.A. County listed for $4 million or more.\nThe Elmer Grey-designed home first hit the market in March for $30.5 million or $3,456 per square foot, according to Zillow records.\nProperty records show the seller is an entity called Leeland Holdings International Inc., registered in the Bahamas.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 David Parnes and Keller Williams Beverly Hills\u2019 Greg Moore hold the listing.\nParnes and Moore are also the listing agents for 234 Saint Pierre Road. The mid-century modern abode sits next door and is listed for $18.5 million, or $3,631 per square foot.\nThe Saint Pierre residence that fell into contract last week counts eight bedrooms and a dozen bathrooms.\nThe Tudor Revival-style home includes an 8,825-square-foot main home, guest home of over 7,000 square feet and a more than 2,000-square-foot outpost for staff or security. In all, the structures sit on more than 2 acres, with walking trails, patios, two pools, a sport court and two gated driveways.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest home to go into contract was 1947 Glencoe Way in the Hollywood Hills.\nThe six-bed, seven-bath home spans over 6,600 square feet and is listed for $6.5 million, or $984 per square foot.\nRecords show the property went into default in September, with $1.4 million owed as of Aug. 11. The seller is Kenny E. Hanna Jr., according to records obtained through PropertyShark.\nStandard Home Realty\u2019s Brandon Guerrero has the listing.\nBuilt in 2022, the home boasts a primary suite that spans an entire floor with a walk-in closet, patio and its own staircase leading to the pool. Other highlights include a waterfall feature with the infinity pool, BBQ area and elevator.\nA total of five properties went into contract last week in L.A. County, which was on par with the year-ago period, the\nEklund Gomes team reported\n. That added up to $44.8 million in asking volume, which was off about 42 percent from the comparable seven-day period a year ago.\nA possible bright spot in the market is on the supply side.\nLast year ended with 939 homes available for sale in the county, according to the Eklund Gomes report. That\u2019s up slightly from the 875 listings in active inventory that kicked off the start of 2025 and is down from the nearly 1,600 homes available for sale at the most recent peak in mid-June. The clearing of for-sale inventory could signal the start of a swing to a seller\u2019s market for the county should the trend continue.\n",

Dubai-based Saray Capital, which owned a 5.4 percent stake in Paramount, tried to make a last-minute offer for $6.95 per share.

The properties include two Queens shelter properties at 104-16 Tuckerton Street and 95-10 218th Street in Jamaica and three Bronx properties \u2013 a women\u2019s shelter at 1591 East 233rd Street in the Eastchester section, an industrial building at 4510 White Plains Road in Wakefield and 2443 Poplar Street in Westchester Square, where a men\u2019s homeless shelter was planned.\nDorm dollars | $76M | Brooklyn Heights\nGoldman Sachs and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $76 million loan to refinance Hawkins Way Capital and V\u00e4rde Partners\u2019 student housing complex at 97 and 119 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. The fresh financing for the 99,0000-square- foot buildings replaces a $69 million loan from CIM Group. Hawkins Way bought the properties in 2017 for $18 million from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and converted them to student housing for St. Francis College. V\u00e4rde Partners became part owner of the property in 2021. The deal is part of a $430 CMBS loan package for a portfolio of three student housing buildings owned by V\u00e4rde and Hawkins Way in New York and Boston.\n",

        "content": "Downtown West Palm Beach\u2019s office market is booming. But not everyone can afford to stay.\nBillionaire Steve Ross\u2019 hefty office investment and development in downtown West Palm supercharged the market, aligning with city and county boosters\u2019 vision for growth. And Ross\u2019 towers have become a magnet for tenants.\nAs Ross\u2019 investment increased rents across downtown West Palm, including in buildings he doesn\u2019t own, some longtime area tenants have been priced out, leading them to seek space in suburban Palm Beach County areas, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n. Development in these less flashy submarkets also is picking up, the outlet\nreported\n.\nLaw firm Lytal, Reiter, Smith, Ivey &amp; Fronrath moved the majority of its office to Palm Beach Gardens last year from its space at downtown West Palm\u2019s\nNorthbridge Centre\n, where it was a tenant for four decades.\nVanderbilt Office Properties and Trinity Capital Advisors own Northbridge.\n\u201cThe proposed renewal rate was three to four times what we were paying,\u201d Lytal Reiter\u2019s Kevin Ryan told the publication, saying downtown rates are \u201cout of control.\u201d\nLytal Reiter, which focuses on personal injury and medical malpractice, opened its Palm Beach Gardens office at 4300 TBC Way.\nOthers are looking to make the move after getting sticker shock from the over $100 per square foot rents in downtown West Palm, according to Neil Merin of NAI/Merin Hunter Codman.\nAt least two office projects are on tap in suburban Palm Beach County.\nGatsby Florida, an arm of Gatsby Enterprises, plans the eight-story, 220,000-square-foot office building,\nThe Modern\n, and an adjacent six-story garage at 11200 RCA Center Drive in Palm Beach Gardens.\nShortly after last year\u2019s election in New York, Babak Ebrahimzadeh of Gatsby Florida told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the project partly will target New Yorkers moving to South Florida following Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win.\nConstruction completion of The Modern is expected in 2027.\nGatsby paid\n$17.5 million\nin 2022 for the development site, which is near the firm\u2019s\nDiVosta Towers\noffice complex.\nIn Boca Raton, the two-building, 140,000-square-foot\nThe Aletto\noffice complex is under construction and about 60 percent pre-leased.\nThese office developments are partly driven by demand for top tier offices in the suburbs, developers and brokers told the outlet.\nRoss, 85, stepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, in 2024 to start and lead West Palm-based Related Ross. That firm primarily focuses on downtown West Palm. Ross, owner of the Formula One Race and the Miami Dolphins, also has completed and is developing condos, apartments and hotels in West Palm. He has about a\ndozen office buildings\nin the submarket, including those purchased, completed, under construction and planned.\nHe tapped his New York network to quickly tenant his office buildings, primarily with out-of-state financial services firms. More recently,\nRelated Ross\nalso has made a push to turn Palm Beach County into a tech hub.\nRoss remains nonexecutive chairman of Related Companies and its biggest single shareholder.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "Another wealthy local buyer just surfaced from Ken Griffin\u2019s retreat from Chicago\u2019s luxury condo market.\nCharlie Mills, chairman and former CEO of Northfield-based Medline Industries, was the buyer who paid $7.4 million in April for Griffin\u2019s full-floor unit on the 35th floor of the Gold Coast tower at 9 West Walton Street. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat Mills and his wife are now planning to sink another $2.75 million into building out the raw space, according to a building permit recently filed with the city.\nThe deal, first reported by Elite Street, marks a sharp haircut from Griffin\u2019s original bet on the building. The\nCitadel founder\npaid $12.5 million in 2017 for the 7,327-square-foot unit, part of a broader buying spree that included the building\u2019s top four floors. Griffin never built out the space, leaving it unfinished even as he shelled out $58.75 million for the combined upper floors.\nAfter announcing in 2022 that he was moving both his hedge fund empire and his personal residence to Florida,\nGriffin\nbegan unwinding his Chicago holdings. The four floors ultimately sold for a combined $34.9 million, a loss of more than 40 percent from his purchase price.\nThe 35th-floor condo had a particularly bumpy ride. Griffin first listed it in 2022 for $14 million, pulled it from the market the following year, then quietly sold it off-market in April 2025 to a land trust that concealed the buyer\u2019s identity. A December permit, however, names Mills as the current owner and shows he hired architect Michael Waechter and Wujcik Construction to handle the initial buildout, according to the Tribune.\nAlso on the upper floors of the building, Illinois\nGov. JB Pritzker\npaid $19 million in 2024 for the building\u2019s top two floors, also acquired from Griffin, though he has yet to file permits for his own buildout. Another Griffin unit, the 36th floor, sold in April for $8.5 million, but the buyer remains unknown.\nMedline\nwent public in December, four years after the Mills family sold a majority stake in the medical supply giant to private equity firms, giving the former CEO plenty of dry powder for a high-end Chicago homecoming.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 20-year deal gives Starr floors 16 through 27 and accounts for about 30 percent of the 930,000-square-foot building. The landlord did not disclose the asking rent.\nThe lease marks a big win for BXP, which started construction without a significant amount of the space pre-leased. Starr will use the space as its New York headquarters, expanding and relocating from another BXP building at 399 Park Avenue. The firm\nsigned a lease in May\nfor 49,000-square-feet at Silverstein Properties\u2019 1177 Sixth Avenue and will continue to occupy that space.\nCushman &amp;\u00a0 Wakefield\u2019s John Picco, Peter Van Duyne and Alex Lachmund represented Starr in the deal. A CBRE team including Peter Turchin, John Maher and Evan Haskell represented the landlord.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October that Starr was\nin agreement\nto lease roughly a third of the development, but neither company would comment. The deal is the latest sign that large tenants are willing to lock in long-term leases for Class A office space in core locations as New York\u2019s office market\ncontinues to rebound\npost-pandemic.\nThe development of 343 Madison has been fraught with financial challenges. In September, BXP\nlowered its dividend\nby 30 percent to help pay for the\n$2 billion office tower\n, searching for $50 million in quarterly savings.\nThe development site of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s former headquarters suffered a blow last summer when Norges Bank\nbacked out of a plan to be a 45 percent partner\nin the project.\nSince then, BXP has been searching for a partner to pick up as much as half of the development cost. CEO Owen Thomas has said that BXP\u2019s costs could drop to $500 million under that scenario.\n",

        "content": "Boca Raton officials moved to tighten oversight of city land deals, approving an ordinance that requires two public hearings and findings that justify how the deals will help the public.\nThe measure, approved by the city council Tuesday night by a vote of 3 to 1, was approved more than a month after a\njudge blocked a proposed referendum\nthat would have required any sale or lease of public land larger than a half-acre to be approved by Boca Raton voters instead of just elected officials.\nThe blocked referendum, which garnered thousands of signatures from registered voters, and the new city law were inspired by a pending 99-year lease deal with David Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group that would enable them to build a 1.15-million-square-foot mixed-use community near Brightline\u2019s Boca Raton station, a deal that has already been backed by the\ncity\u2019s planning and zoning board\n.\nBrandon Schaad, director of development services, said the new city code creates a \u201chigher standard\u201d for the sale or transfer of city land. Among other things, the city now requires that people within 500 feet of a half-acre property under consideration for sale or lease be notified 10 days prior to the first hearing.\nThe transaction would also have to accomplish a public purpose, such as revenue for the city, substantial community benefits, or a project that would enhance recreational, cultural or economic opportunities for residents, according to the ordinance.\nThe new code specifies that this won\u2019t apply to easements or right-of-way conveyances needed for utilities and other public purposes. It also won\u2019t impact renewals and extensions of already approved leases where \u201cthe underlying public purpose continues to be served.\u201d\nJon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca, said the ordinance was drafted by Mayor Scott Singer to \u201cmimic\u201d a law pushed by his grassroots organization that would have required such deals to be ratified by voters. Although Save Boca\u2019s petition drive for such a referendum attracted thousands of voters, it was declared unconstitutional in late November by Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Curley following a lawsuit from Boca Raton attorney Ned Kimmelman. Pearlman said the judge\u2019s ruling is under appeal.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that [the city ordinance] does not put the power of disposition of city land, the sale of city lands and the lease of city lands, in the hands of the people, which the Save Boca laws do,\u201d Pearlman said.\nSinger, though, said his proposed ordinance marked an improvement over the status quo.\n\u201cWe should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\u201d the mayor said.\nBut Councilmember Andy Thomson, a critic of the One Boca project, said he didn\u2019t see the Singer\u2019s proposed ordinance as \u201cmeaningful.\u201d He voted against it.\nAlthough a referendum on future city land deals has so far been stopped, the council, Terra and Frisbie agreed last year to hold a referendum on the One Boca project on March 10.\nBoca Raton voters will have final say on One Boca, but city officials are still moving forward with the process. At this week\u2019s meeting, the council also introduced an ordinance to approve a 99-year lease deal with Terra and Frisbie.\nUnder their current plans, Terra and Frisbie would build three buildings, up to 130 feet tall, that would consist of 947 condos and apartments, 120,000 square feet of office, 79,100 square feet of retail, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, and a 180-room hotel on 7.8 acres of mostly public land at approximately Northwest Second Avenue and Northwest Fourth Street, Deputy City Manager Andrew Lukasik said. The deal would include Terra and Frisbie reviving the 17-acre city hall campus, which is scheduled to come back for second reading on Jan. 20.\nThe proposed development has been evolving ever since Boca Raton officials picked Terra and Frisbie over four other contenders nearly a year ago to redevelop its city hall campus. Back then, Terra and Frisbie\u2019s proposed project spanned\n2.5 million square feet\n, which was later reduced to about 1.5 million square feet. Following vocal opposition from hundreds of residents, Terra and Frisbie agreed to further\nscale back\ntheir project and limit it to the east side of Northwest Second Avenue.\n",

        "content": "One of the original office buildings in Dallas\u2019 Harwood District has a new owner, adding another chapter to the slow-motion reshuffling of one of Uptown\u2019s most distinctive office enclaves.\nDallas-based Cawley Partners acquired Harwood No. 1, a seven-story, roughly 106,000-square-foot office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, and plans to renovate the property in the first half of the year. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal closed Dec. 30 and was announced Jan. 6, according to a statement from the buyer.\nThe building, developed in 1982 by Harwood International, was the first office project in the 19-block district and was originally built for Swiss luxury watchmaker Rolex. The building is about 50 percent leased, with tenants including Cadence Bank, Huron Consulting Group and Unifeye Vision Partners.\nFinancial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but the Dallas Central Appraisal District last valued the property at $25 million, including about $7.6 million for the land. First United Bank sold the building after regaining control through a November\nforeclosure auction\n, where it posted a winning bid of $27.2 million, according to public records.\nThe sale comes amid mounting pressure on Harwood International, the firm led by Gabriel Barbier-Mueller that spent decades assembling and curating the district at the seam of Uptown and Victory Park. Over the past year, several Harwood buildings have traded hands, often at moments of financial distress. In 2024, Harwood sold\nfour office buildings\n\u2014 Harwood No. 2, 6, 7 and 10 \u2014 totaling nearly 900,000 square feet to private equity giant TPG.\nLate last year, law firm K&amp;L Gates signed on at Harwood No. 4, a tower known for its Asian art-filled lobby. But uncertainty still hangs over future development. Harwood landed a $100 million loan from TPG\u2019s real estate arm to jump-start construction of Harwood No. 15, though that project has yet to break ground after Jones Day, long expected to be the anchor tenant, backed out,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nCawley Partners, best known for suburban office developments along the Dallas North Tollway in Plano and\nFrisco\n, plans to overhaul the lobby, corridors, restrooms and top-floor lounge, as well as build out roughly 50,000 square feet of spec suites. Renovation work is expected to begin late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter, a spokesperson told the publication.\nThe building still bears a nod to its origins, with a Rolex clock in the atrium, even though the watchmaker later decamped to another Harwood tower.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "When Gov. Kathy Hochul stood on a stage a year ago, praising the real estate industry and musing that any elected official absent from the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s annual gala was \u201cmissing a damn good party,\u201d then-mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani was on the street outside the event.\nThe protestors with whom he gathered held signs that read \u201cRent Freeze\u201d and \u201cREBNY Raised My Rent.\u201d\nA lot has happened since that party. Mamdani now acknowledges that his view of the private sector\u2019s role in the housing market has shifted, making his case to the city\u2019s business community in closed-door meetings. Hochul endorsed Mamdani in September and seems more open than in the past to raising the money the new mayor needs to fund key parts of his agenda.\nAs Mamdani begins his term and Hochul intensifies her reelection campaign, their attempts not to alienate the constituents on either side at last year\u2019s REBNY gala has generated a powerful dynamic, not just for Mamdani\u2019s early days or Hochul\u2019s chances at reelection, but also for what legislation will get done this year and how real estate industry priorities will fare.\nG\nood alternatives\nAt least rhetorically, the mayor is likely to play a big part in the governor\u2019s race.\nMamdani has pitched raising taxes on the city\u2019s highest earners and corporations to fund universal childcare and free buses. Hochul has been against both, though reportedly she has softened on corporate tax rate increases.\nDoing so, however, threatens to anger high-earning donors, including those\nin the real estate industry\n. They could turn to Trump-backed Republican Nassau executive Bruce Blakeman, one challenger. Another, Rep. Elise Stefanik, announced in December that she was dropping out of the race.\n\u201cYou have two strong Republicans running against the governor, both very close to Trump,\u201d lobbyist Suri Kasirer said during an interview before Stefanik dropped out. \u201cTheir argument is likely going to be: We\u2019re close to Trump, and we can prevent the policies that Zohran has promised.\u201d\nAnd for those who supported Mamdani, there\u2019s Lieutenant Gov. Antonio Delgado, who has also used Mamdani as a lodestar, telling Politico that he viewed Mamdani\u2019s win as a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of his run for governor. A \u201cbig reason\u201d he is running is that he believes \u201cthe status quo is broken.\u201d\nBeyond the governor\u2019s race, political events this year could show where the Democratic party stands in New York. In the wake of Mamdani\u2019s win, moderate candidates saw early success in key contests, at times with the help of the mayor-elect.\nFor example, Council member Julie Menin declared victory in the City Council speaker\u2019s race even before she officially won on Jan. 7. And Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 backed off his bid to challenge House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, after failing to secure support from the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani reportedly urged the DSA against endorsing Oss\u00e9.\nMamdani also endorsed City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is running to unseat Rep. Dan Goldman over the DSA-endorsed Council Member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who has decided not to run.\nN\not a housing year\nHochul\u2019s primary and general election challenges, as well as the danger of angering the voters who made Mamdani mayor, could influence what policies the governor and the state legislature tackle.\n\u201cBecause of that push and pull on either side, I\u2019m not confident that a lot will get done on housing this year,\u201d George Fontas, a lobbyist whose firm represented a coalition that fought against the\ngood cause eviction\nbill, said. (A version of the bill passed in 2024.)\nDevelopers have argued that the property tax break 485x needs to be amended to encourage more housing construction. Since the incentive was enacted, developers have\nfavored projects\nwith 99 housing units or fewer, to avoid paying construction wages that kick in at 100 units, and then become higher in certain areas of the city at 150 units.\nChanging those thresholds or reducing the wages would be a major fight that would outrage New York\u2019s construction unions, something the governor would likely be loath to do in an election year. Delgado has made clear that he thinks the state\u2019s existing housing tax credit and subsidy programs do not work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a can of worms anyone is looking to open this year,\u201d one real estate consultant said, on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIf she goes too far on the developer\u2019s side, she runs the risk of losing labor, and that is critical for her.\u201d\nKasirer said it\u2019s probably too early to tell if the legislature will pick up 485x. Lawmakers have tended to wait until such programs expire before amending them, but 485x has a longer runway than its predecessors and doesn\u2019t expire until June 2034.\nTweaks to the state\u2019s rent laws would also be a tough sell in an election year, Fontas said. Reforms to elements of the law, like the Individual Apartment Improvement and Major Capital Improvement programs, could help landlords increase rents on stabilized apartments after completing renovations.\nSome streamlining of the state\u2019s environmental review process and increased resources for housing courts may be achievable, however, Fontas added.\nBut Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said he doesn\u2019t know how much longer the legislature can \u201cignore\u201d the deterioration of the city\u2019s rent stabilization stock. He noted that Mamdani has \u201celevated the issue of rent-stabilized housing and its overall operations to almost national proportions,\u201d through his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized housing.\nOn the bright side, Mamdani has spoken about the need to address landlord costs through\nproperty tax\nand\ninsurance\nreform.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an acknowledgement that you cannot simply freeze the rents and expect good results to happen in this housing stock,\u201d Burgos said.\nWhether those talking points turn into action at the state level remains to be seen.\nSome in the industry fear that the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would\ngive tenants first dibs\non buying their building if their landlord decides to sell, will gain traction this year, especially after the city passed a version that applies to nonprofits and other entities. Eric Adams\nvetoed\nthe bill, COPA, on his final day in office.\nThe New York State Tenant Bloc, a DSA-affiliated group, formed last year to organize tenants to only vote for mayoral candidates who supported a rent freeze. This year, it is focused on expanding rent stabilization throughout the state, said spokesperson Ritti Singh. That includes pushing for a measure that would make it easier for localities outside of New York City to adopt rent stabilization.\nSingh said securing more funding for the state\u2019s housing voucher program will also be a top priority.\nShe doesn\u2019t think the fact that it\u2019s an election year will necessarily deter the governor and lawmakers from tackling controversial issues.\n\u201cWe thought in 2024, there would be no housing deal for this reason,\u201d she said, referring to the state\u2019s budget that year, which included 485x and good cause eviction, along with several other housing-related policies.\nShe pointed to Mamdani\u2019s win, and the fact that he ran on a promise to freeze rents for stabilized apartments as a key reason the governor and lawmakers can\u2019t ignore this part of the affordability agenda.\n\u201cZohran Mamdani just ran on a rent freeze,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a mandate.\u201d",

        "content": "Co-op shareholders at Carnegie House were dealt a blow by the New York County Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parcel\u2019s landowners in a dispute over the ground lease.\nThe court upheld a rent hike for the property\u2019s ground lease, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n, affecting the payments of hundreds of shareholders that may no longer be able to keep up with payments. The rent increase, enacted by David Werner and Rubin Schron, is expected to bring the annual ground rent from $4.36 million to approximately $24 million.\n\u201cIn the middle of a housing crisis, our billionaire landowners are pulling out all the stops to push out middle-class New Yorkers for their own gain,\u201d Carnegie House board of directors President Richard Hirsch said in a statement, promising an appeal.\nFor his part, Hirsch\u2019s monthly costs could nearly triple from $5,000 to $13,000.\nA spokesperson for the landowners said they were \u201cprepared to work with permanent residents demonstrating a need for rental assistance.\u201d\nThe ground lease rent at 100 West 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row expired on March 15. The lease was renewed, but the landowners and co-op did not agree on rent as a scheduled reset arrived last year.\nInitial talks positioned rent at $40 million, 10 times the existing rate. The board came back with $5.4 million and then increased the offer by $50,000, according to court filings.\nThe owners then offered $25 million; the co-op would be responsible for 75 percent of the rent (10 percent of that is paid for by proceeds from the building\u2019s garage), while the owners of the retail portion would cover 25 percent, a representative for the landowners confirmed over the\nsummer\n.\nThe board and a limited liability company that controls the building\u2019s retail space filed a lawsuit in September 2024 asking the court to temporarily halt ground lease negotiations, but the judge\ndeclined\nthat request two months later and\ndismissed\nthe case entirely in March.\nIf Carnegie House fails to make good on its ground lease, it would lose it and the building would revert to rent-stabilization status, destroying owner equity while leaving shareholders stuck with mortgage payments.\nThe dispute already put out shareholders who struggled to secure mortgages due to the uncertain forthcoming costs of living in the co-op. Unit values declined during the fight and are well below market rate for the neighborhood.\nSchron and Werner purchased the land underneath the building in 2014 for $261 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

A few weeks earlier, Prologis\nbought a 177,000-square-foot industrial building\nfor $59 million.\nElsewhere in the Bay Area, in November, Prologis\nbought a portfolio of 11 buildings\nin Brisbane\u2019s Crocker Industrial Park for $314.5 million. That marked the priciest Bay Area warehouse and distribution transaction of 2025. The San Francisco-based firm, the world\u2019s largest owner and developer of industrial real estate, acquired the structures from\nCalifornia State Teachers Retirement Fund\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A quiet pocket of single-family homes in suburban Addison is shaping up to be the latest frontline in Chicagoland\u2019s industrial expansion wars.\nResidents of 53 Trails Estates, an unincorporated neighborhood east of Route 53 and south of Army Trail Boulevard, contend that Transwestern Development is targeting the area for a potential industrial or commercial project, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The push sparked months of organizing, public meetings and neighbor-on-neighbor tension in a community many residents insist was never meant to be considered a teardown.\nThe neighborhood, which includes more than 90 homes, sits just outside Addison\u2019s municipal boundaries, in a village that already boasts one of the largest industrial parks in Illinois. UPS, Pampered Chef and Nabisco all have a presence nearby, making the land increasingly attractive to developers chasing logistics and flex demand along major transportation corridors.\nTranswestern\nhas not publicly detailed a proposal, and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment. But residents told the outlet that outreach by a commercial real estate firm working on the developer\u2019s behalf has made it clear that the area is being explored for\nindustrial redevelopment\n.\nAt a Dec. 15 village meeting, Addison Village Manager Joe Maranowicz said there is no formal proposal before the board, and no action is underway. Village staff told the developer that any next steps would require interest from all homeowners \u2014 a high bar in a neighborhood that is anything but unified.\n\u201cLast thing we want is a community to be divided amongst each other,\u201d Maranowicz said at the meeting, acknowledging that some residents want to sell, while others are firmly opposed.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s appeal lies precisely in what industrial development would erase: mature trees, large lots and decades-long ties among neighbors, some of the residents contend. Several residents have lived there for 30 or 40 years. Others moved in more recently, drawn by the area\u2019s mid-century homes and low-key suburban character.\nSupporters of redevelopment, however, argue that Addison can\u2019t afford to turn its back on\ngrowth\n. With industrial demand still strong and neighboring municipalities competing for employers and tax base, some residents see a partial or phased development as a reasonable compromise.\nThe dispute echoes past battles in the\nO\u2019Hare area\n, where longstanding neighborhoods like Mohawk Manor were eventually bought out and demolished for industrial projects. Those scars loom large for residents now facing similar uncertainty.\nThe standoff has for now left 53 Trails Estates in limbo. Yard signs, custom T-shirts and even Christmas lights signal opposition, while others quietly weigh offers and future possibilities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

While the national median home price rose by 4.8 percent to $375,000, the median in the Austin-Round Rock area fell by 8.2 percent to $416,000.\u00a0Rhodes is just the latest movie actor to sell a home in Austin.\nEmma Stone sold her Tarrytown mansion\nlast month after asking $23.5 million for the house.\n",

But after the tower was completed in 2022, the tech giant never moved in, turning the sail-shaped glass tower into a downtown riddle: fully leased, architecturally striking and entirely vacant.\nGoogle\nconfirmed\nin March that it planned to occupy the building by the end of 2025.\nLeaving the tower empty was hardly cheap. According to commercial real estate firm Avison Young, trophy office rents in Austin\u2019s central business district averaged $67.39 per square foot at the end of 2019. At that rate, the Austin Business Journal estimated that Google would have been paying roughly $53 million annually \u2014 or about $145,000 per day \u2014 for space it wasn\u2019t using. That burn rate, while eye-popping by local standards, is a rounding error for\nAlphabet\n, which most recently reported about $125 billion in annual net income.\nGoogle wasn\u2019t exactly homeless during the gap either. The company also leases space at East Austin\u2019s Saltillo development and occupies much of the neighboring tower at 500 West Second Street. Whether those leases will be renewed or shed now that Sail Tower is active remains unclear.\nThe building\u2019s dark years didn\u2019t scare off investors. Atlanta-based Cousins Properties\nbought\nthe Sail Tower from Dallas-based Trammell Crow Company for $521.8 million in December 2024, betting on Google\u2019s long-term commitment. At the time, Cousins executives said they were comfortable with Google\u2019s plans for Austin, even as the tower sat unused.\nDespite leasing the entire building, Google may not be alone inside for long. The company has been marketing the top six floors for sublease. One potential subtenant is\nDigital Realty Trust\n, which filed plans last year to build out an executive office suite and terrace space on the upper floors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An AI startup with a housing stipend is swapping Long Island City for Williamsburg\u2019s waterfront.\nVoice analytics company Rilla inked a 57,000-square-foot lease at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. The AI company will occupy the entire eighth-floor penthouse, along with nearly 4,000 square feet of private outdoor space, the landlord announced.\nThe 10-year lease pushes occupancy at the eight-story building to 72 percent. The asking rent was $76 per square foot.\nNewmark\u2019s Cooper Weisman and Ryan Gessin represented Rilla in the deal. The landlord was represented in-house by Craig Panzirer and Alex Radmin, along with Newmark\u2019s Jordan Gosin, Will Grover and Drew Wiley.\nRilla will move its 160 employees from Long Island City. CEO Sebastian Jimenez made news this summer\nwhen he announced\nthe company was covering up to $1,500 per month in rent for employees who lived close to its Long Island City office (the company defines \u201cclose\u201d as within a 10-minute bike ride). Rilla follows a\n9-9-6 work schedule\n, meaning employees work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.\nA company representative said Jimenez will be moving to Williamsburg and employees can choose whether or not they want to relocate closer to the office to receive the rent stipend.\nThe lease marks a win for the borough, where office landlords have\nstruggled\nto fill the glut of new buildings built over the last two decades. Buildings like the Refinery at Domino and 25 Kent are attracting AI and tech tenants, though most deals so far have been small to mid-sized.\nRubenstein Partners co-developed the 500,000-square-foot project\nwith Toby Moskovits\u2019\nHeritage Equity Partners, billing it as the borough\u2019s first ground-up commercial development in more than four decades. In 2018, Eyal Ofer\u2019s firm made a preferred-equity investment of $100 million.\nThe building opened to tenants in 2019 and streetwear brand Kith signed on as an anchor tenant. Global Holdings took over management of the building in April and landed recent lease deals from e-commerce company Queen One, Five Iron Golf and Autonomous Technologies Group.\n",

Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are providing the debt, according to\nCommercial Real Estate Direct\n.\nMarc Holliday\u2019s firm is expected to make a $270 million down payment to secure the loan,\u00a0 equivalent to about 36 percent of acquisition\u2019s total financing. The figure represents a significant increase on the down payment Blackstone put down when it acquired the building a decade ago.\nThe five-year loan is expected to close next week, according to a report from S&amp;P Global.\nThe 600,000-square-foot building, which is 97 percent occupied, is filled with financial firms and hedge funds as tenants. The building\u2019s largest tenant is PineBridge Investments, occupying about 75,000 square feet; other major tenants include BTIG, Raine Group and a division of Creative Artists Agency. The seller previously spent $180 million renovating the property.\nSL Green will need to convince some tenants to stay, as about a third could leave early with a termination fee, according to S&amp;P.

The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the project, dubbed The Shops at Pheasant Run, would rise at the southeast corner of East Main Street and Kautz Road.\nChicago-based Vequity\nsubmitted\na concept plan for the site through an LLC dubbed SC Landman. Vequity acquired the property in April after the last remaining resort structures were demolished the year prior. The parcel represents the final chapter in the redevelopment of the once-sprawling Pheasant Run property, which has steadily been carved up since the resort shuttered.\nCity staff is reviewing the proposal, while the developers gather feedback. Once that process wraps, the group will decide whether to formally pursue the project.\nTo get there, the\ndevelopers\nare seeking $3.3 million in city assistance to offset what they describe as \u201cextraordinary development costs,\u201d including soil and environmental remediation, and to achieve a \u201creasonable rate of return,\u201d according to city documents. The site sits within the Pheasant Run tax-increment financing district, which was created with the expectation that redevelopment would require public subsidy due to the property\u2019s condition.\nThe land once held Pheasant Run\u2019s main resort buildings and hotel, which were destroyed in a\nmassive 2022 fire\nwhile the property sat vacant. Two teenagers were later placed on probation for starting the blaze.\nTwo site plans were submitted for review. Both envision a mix of service-oriented retail and dining. One version shows a gas station, hotel and urgent care facility on the east end of the site, while the other swaps in a car dealership. Either plan would introduce new driveways, shared access points and a stormwater detention area, with entrances off Kautz Road, East Main Street and Pheasant Run Drive.\nSeveral components would require zoning relief, including approval for multiple drive-through uses \u2014 a point city officials have already flagged. During a December plan commission meeting, staff also pushed for a more pedestrian-friendly layout, calling for sidewalks along storefronts, internal walkways connecting individual lots and paths around the detention area.\nCity officials\nencouraged public art, upgraded landscaping and a cohesive architectural approach across the development. Despite the critiques, the city has expressed \u201cgeneral support\u201d for the concept, according to documents.\nElsewhere on the former resort grounds, redevelopment has leaned heavily toward auto and industrial uses. Two car dealerships now occupy 21 acres, while the former golf course has been transformed into an 85-acre industrial park with three warehouses completed and a fourth underway.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

With the start of the state legislative session and the first meeting of the new City Council, things are about to get more interesting.\nAs expected, Julie Menin was elected City Council speaker during the Council\u2019s first meeting. Top of mind is whether she will move to override former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\nof the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act and a trio of housing regulation bills. Menin has said the Council is considering its options.\nIn her first address as speaker, Menin said the City Council will release its own housing plan looking for opportunities to redevelop the city\u2019s libraries to also include housing (as was done with the Sunset Park library) and to build on city-owned land.\nDuring her speech, Menin also noted that the first Muslim mayor and first Jewish speaker of the Council are serving at the same time.\n\u201cThis moment truly is historic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what will write this interfaith leadership into the history books is if it can act as an opportunity for all of us to come together \u2014 to calm tensions, to bridge divides and to recognize we are one city, no matter the religion we practice or the language we speak.\u201d\nIn Albany, the legislative session kicked off Wednesday, and in less than a week, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lay out her agenda in the State of the State. Hochul is up for re-election and is going to face pressure on the left to support tax increases on the state\u2019s wealthiest, which is key to funding Mamdani\u2019s key campaign promises. She\u2019s also up against a Republican challenger likely to emphasize the need to stop the new mayor\u2019s agenda.\nIndustry folks don\u2019t seem to have a lot of\nhope\nthat changes to 485x are on the table this year. Landlord groups have previously pushed for legislation that would allow one-time rent resets on vacant stabilized apartments, though lawmakers have shown little appetite to do so. Mamdani has voiced support for property tax reform and alternative insurance models, though, as ways to address owner costs.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Hochul include anything about property tax reform or other measures to address operating costs in rent-stabilized buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nOpen New York is pushing back against the Landmarks Preservation Commission\u2019s recent designation of Beverley Square West and Ditmas Park West as historic districts. The Yimby group argues that the designations unfairly exempt the areas from the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The designations await review by City Planning and City Council approval.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nChristina Cover, a public school teacher and DSA member, is considering running for Assembly District 84 in the South Bronx\n,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Assembly member Amanda Septimo, who currently represents the district, is challenging Rep. Ritchie Torres.\n\u2014\nAs part of her State of the State priorities, which will be announced next week, Gov. Kathy Hochul will propose new restrictions on 3D-printed guns and other illegal firearms\n,\nSpectrum News reports\n.\n\u2014\nAnd in news that was not on my bingo card, President Donald Trump\nannounced\nWednesday that he plans to block institutional investors from buying up single-family homes.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.1 million\nat 56 Crosby Street. The Soho condo unit is 4,000 square feet. It last sold in 2010 for $4.4 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$237.5 million\nfor 1540 Broadway. Buyers BDT &amp; MSD Partners are\nreportedly\ninvesting $150 million in amenities packages for the 907,000-square-foot office building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $18.5 million for 205 Clinton Street. The Cobble Hill townhouse is listed by\nCompass\u2019\nLindsay Barrett, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 68,813-square-foot, 13-story, mixed-use building at 7-45 Wyckoff Avenue in Ridgewood. Kao Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "DWS Group sold a two-building office complex in Coral Gables for $119.6 million, amid the firm\u2019s nationwide divestment from the asset class.\nDallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought The Alhambra, consisting of the 14-story building at 2 Alhambra Plaza and the seven-story building at 95 Merrick Way, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Lone Star Funds is led by Donald Quintin and John Grayken. Square2 and Highline are based in Miami.\nThe buyers obtained a $98.5 million loan from an entity tied to Rialto Capital Management. The debt consists of DWS\u2019 outstanding $58.3 million balance on its loan to a previous financier, which Rialto assumed, and an additional $40.2 million, according to records.\nThe deal comes amid a slow South Florida office market compared to the pandemic-induced boom fueled by an influx of out-of-state tenants and high valuations.\nThe 326,000-square-foot Alhambra is about 87 percent leased, the release says. The sale amounts to $367 per square foot.\nThe complex, completed in 1961 and 1987, spans a full city block. A Hyatt Regency Coral Gables Hotel sits between the two office buildings. The hotel wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nSquare2 Management will manage the property.\nHermen Rodriguez and Mathew McCormack were part of the JLL team that represented DWS. A JLL team also secured the financing on behalf of the buyers.\nDWS, and its U.S. real estate subsidiary Rreef, have been shedding offices in recent years. It put The Alhambra on the market last summer with a target price of about\n$125 million\n.\nDWS, led by Americas CEO Hepsen Uzcan and Todd Henderson as head of real estate for the Americas, paid $118.6 million for The Alhambra in 2015, according to property records and the firm\u2019s website.\nHenderson told\nThe Real Deal\nlast summer that Rreef made a policy decision to divest from its\noffice portfolio nationwide\neven before the pandemic took a toll on occupancies.\nIn February, the firm sold two office properties in downtown Fort Lauderdale, also for minimal gains from what it paid for them. DWS sold Las Olas Centre I &amp; II, consisting of an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas Boulevard and a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas Boulevard, for\n$208 million\n. Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors was the buyer. DWS paid $204 million for Las Olas Centre in 2014, records show.\nIn the same week, Rreef Property Trust sold the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at\u00a0 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$221 million\n, also to Lone Star Funds\u2019 real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital. Rreef paid\n$220 million\nfor the property in 2016.\nNew-to-market firms are still leasing in South Florida, though fewer than the bonanza in the first three years of the pandemic. But office investment sales became scarcer amid higher interest rates and other elevated expenses such as insurance, widening bid-ask gaps and\nlowering property valuations\n.\nLandlords divesting from offices nationwide are more likely to sell in South Florida, where they can still sell for at least breakeven prices or for smaller losses than what they would record elsewhere in the U.S.,\nexperts have told TRD\n.\nAlso in Coral Gables, AEW Capital Management sold the 11-story Ryder Colonnade office building at 169 Coral Way to Fort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate for\n$70.4 million\nlast month. The deal marked a 13 percent discount from what AEW paid over a decade ago.\u00a0A tougher capital markets environment opened the door to all-cash buyers who can avoid taking out financing. In last year\u2019s top office deal, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega paid\n$274.4 million\nin cash for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Residents and business owners gathered Wednesday in the Pacific Palisades as they pointed the finger at local and state officials for bungling the recovery and prevention of last year\u2019s deadly\nwildfires\n.\nCalled the \u201cThey let us burn\u201d demonstration, it was held on the one-year anniversary of the\nPalisades and Eaton blazes\n, which damaged or destroyed some 16,000 residential and commercial structures across mostly Altadena, Pacific Palisades and parts of Malibu.\nWhile local and state officials have repeatedly pegged the recovery as the fastest in history, many residents and business owners are still grappling with delays in insurance claims, rising construction costs and a web of taxes and fees for rebuilding or selling off their lots. They\u2019re asking their government leaders for accountability in helping complete the recovery.\nAt least one public official was on hand to listen to speakers at the demonstration, with Los Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park taking to the podium at one point to criticize \u201cbotched evacuations\u201d and \u201cdry hydrants.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you all are asking for going forward is basic. It is reasonable and we shouldn\u2019t have to beg our government to make this right,\u201d Park, whose district includes the\nPalisades\n, told the crowd of hundreds.\nShe earned cheers when she allowed that \u201cof course, your permit fees should be waived,\u201d before criticizing speculators, saying \u201cdevelopers are circling like vultures, looking to profit by adding density.\u201d\nThe ire harbored by some could earn reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who lost his home to the Palisades Fire, some voter support as he announced his run for mayor of Los Angeles. He confirmed it while at the podium in a shock announcement that will pit \u201cThe Hills\u201d star against incumbent Mayor Karen Bass in a move that drew cheers from the crowd.\n\u201cI coped with [the fires] by eating burritos and putting every ounce of energy into uncovering the truth and the dirty facts I\u2019ve uncovered this year will completely blow you away,\u201d Pratt told the crowd. \u201cI used to think my taxpayer dollars funded a functional city and a state government whose infrastructure and essential services would be there when I needed them, but I was completely na\u00efve.\u201d\nPratt would be the latest political outsider looking to shake up city hall. His announcement follows Presbyterian minister\nRae Chen Huang\n\u2019s bid to also unseat Bass. Huang, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, announced her run in November. While seen as a longshot candidate, she\u2019s campaigning on a platform that includes affordable housing, free transit and addressing public safety through a boost in mental health services.\nOn repeat\nWhile many of the speakers focused on what went wrong a year ago, organizers of the demonstration also outlined 10 key moves seen as necessary for future prevention and shepherding a fast-tracked recovery.\nSome of the imperatives outlined overlap with calls residential agents and brokers made in the weeks after the fires were tamed\nlast year\n, including a stop on permit fees and temporary moratorium on the Measure United to House L.A. levy, or so-called mansion tax, in the city of Los Angeles. The rally organizers are calling for a five-year \u201cULA holiday\u201d on property sales that would normally be hit by the transfer tax, while those who penned the\nagent letter\nasked for an exemption for sellers impacted by the fires.\nThat initial call to action was led by the Oppenheim Group\u2019s Jason Oppenheim and The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack in a letter to Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO Aaron Kirman, who was at the rally, was one of more than 45 agents and brokers who signed last year\u2019s letter.\n\u201cOne year later, the real failure isn\u2019t debris removal, it\u2019s rebuilding,\u201d Kirman said Wednesday. \u201cLeaders treated this like a press problem instead of a housing market crisis. That\u2019s why the five-year ULA holiday and eliminating taxes on rebuilds resonated so strongly. They confront the very policies slowing recovery.\u201d\nThe ULA tax, which has been a sore spot for residential and commercial real estate since going into effect in the spring of 2023, assesses a 4 percent tax on deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those of $10.6 million or more. Voters passed the tax as a 2022 ballot measure.\nIn October, Bass asked the city council to approve an ordinance giving the finance director power to grant a one-time exemption from Measure ULA to residential property owners impacted by the fires. That was followed up in November with the Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery\nrequesting a report\nin 30 days on the feasibility of such a carveout.\nSimilar consideration on the matter of permit fees is also winding its way through city hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, a Beverly Hills-based agent who was also at the demonstration, said full suspension of permit fees is the demand she backs the most.\n\u201cThese homeowners aren\u2019t upgrading or speculating,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are replacing what was lost. Every added fee delays recovery, increases underinsurance risk and pushes families out permanently.\u201d\nLike Kirman, she also supports the temporary ULA suspension and offered that in an ideal situation, the tax would be permanently waived in any instance of disaster recovery.\nAtlas Maize has several clients that are \u201cfrozen\u201d from moving forward, whether that\u2019s due to insurance proceeds not covering construction costs, permit fees or other factors.\n\u201cThese are not isolated cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThey reflect a systemic problem where recovery costs are being shifted onto individual homeowners instead of shared as a public responsibility.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s bulk sale of St. Regis Chicago condos in December was the result of a dispute with Sony over the rights to the popular \u201cOctonauts\u201d children\u2019s show.\nWhen the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group\ntransferred a group of condos valued at $47.5\nmillion in December,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported the buyer was CPE Stage Investments. But property records with more details on the purchasing company weren\u2019t available at the time.\nA recent Cook County deed shows the buyer is connected to Sony Pictures Entertainment, the U.S. media arm of the Tokyo-based media and electronics conglomerate. The deed also shows the sale included 16 of the\n37 condos Wanda owned\nat the building.\nThe transfer of the units at the 101-story, Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive is the conclusion of a long-running legal fight which spilled into a United Kingdom court in 2024.\nIn 2017, Wanda\u2019s children\u2019s entertainment subsidiary purchased a 51 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions, the holding company for the animated show \u201cOctonauts,\u201d from Silvergate, according to a Variety report from 2024.\nThe agreement stipulated the remaining share of Vampire Squid was subject to an option for Wanda to purchase at a later date, the publication reported. When Sony bought Silvergate in 2019, Sony exercised the option and valued the remaining 49 percent at $87.4 million.\nAfter disputes over the price, Sony sued Wanda in 2024, accusing it of neglecting its end of the deal. Last year, a UK judge ordered Wanda to pay Sony $49 million for the remaining 49 percent stake in the \u201cOctonauts\u201d property, ICLG News reported.\nRather than paying cash, Wanda agreed to a non-cash asset swap with Sony, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Wanda acquired the remaining 49 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions while Sony\u2019s subsidiary took over the 16 residential units at the St. Regis.\nThe asset swap gives Wanda full rights to the \u201cOctonauts\u201d intellectual property globally until 2034 and in China until 2053, according to the filing.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Sony will do with the units. Downtown\nChicago condos have been a tough sell\nin recent years, but the St. Regis, which was completed in 2020, notched some of the highest prices downtown in 2025. The bulk price for Sony\u2019s acquisition comes out to an average of nearly $3 million per unit, but it includes an 89th floor unit likely worth much more.\nThat 6,000-square-foot condo never sold individually but was listed in 2019 for $11 million. It was taken off the for-sale market in 2020 but was listed for rent at $35,000 per month for much of 2025; it\u2019s unclear if it was ever leased but the rental listing was most recently removed from the market in November.\nSony Pictures Entertainment and Wanda Group did not respond to requests for comment.\nWang Jianlin\u2019s Wanda has had a long history at the St. Regis. The firm originally invested in the 101-story project in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to debut its first U.S. hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. But after Chinese regulations on overseas investment tightened, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake to Magellan for $270 million in 2020.\nIn March, Wanda marketed the 37 condos it owned in the building as a bulk sale. The condos handed over to Sony came from that pool, property records show.\nIn 2024, Magellan sold its remaining 84 units to Denver-based GD Holdings for $117 million. GD holdings has been able to command high prices for the prime units in that portfolio: A 79th-floor penthouse sold for\n$7.5 million in September\n. In October, Siri co-founder\nDag Kittlaus\nbought an 84th-floor St. Regis penthouse for $9.25 million, property records show.\nThe priciest sale on record at the St. Regis came in 2022, when\nMexican mining executive German Larrea\npurchased a two-story, 10,000-square-foot penthouse spanning the 71st and 72nd floors for $20 million.\n",

        "content": "United States Steel Corporation\n\u2019s real estate arm purchased a former steel mill site in Pittsburg, California, for nine figures.\nU.S. Steel Property Holdings bought the plant site, which operated as a steel mill for decades until it closed two years ago, for $275 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The mill was formerly a 50-50 venture between U.S. Steel Corporation and South Korea-based steel company Posco. In 2020, U.S. Steel Corporation bought Posco\u2019s 50 percent share, placing ownership under U.S. Steel itself. The $275 million internal transfer moves ownership from U.S. Steel Corporation to U.S. Steel Property Holdings.\nThe property spans 11 parcels at addresses on Loveridge Road, East Third Street, Columbia Street, and Antioch-Pittsburg Highway in\nPittsburg\n. U.S. Steel Property Holdings acquired the site through a quitclaim deed, which transfers property ownership from a grantor to a grantee without any warranties or guarantees.\nIn December 2023, U.S. Steel indefinitely paused production at the plant in Pittsburg, halting all manufacturing of cold-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tinplate and tin-free steel. The shutdown coincided with the announcement that Japan-based Nippon Steel would be acquiring the company; in total, 474 workers at the plant lost their jobs. At the time operations were suspended, the factory was the West Coast\u2019s only producer of tin plates for the canning industry, as well as other products. Nippon Steel\u2019s purchase was completed last June.\nNippon Steel\u2019s purchase has appeared to revitalize some of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based firm\u2019s growth efforts. Since Nippon Steel officially took ownership, U.S. Steel has announced plans for a large renovation at an Alabama plant, restarting a blast furnace at an Illinois plant and a revamp of a blast furnace at an Indiana plant.\nU.S. Steel\u2019s plans for the Pittsburg, California, plant are not immediately clear.\nThe East Bay in particular has become the manufacturing and industrial hub of the Bay Area, attracting investors from near and far.\nIn July BKM Capital Partners and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, through their industrial-focused joint venture,\npurchased a 16-building industrial portfolio\nin Concord and Hayward from a Blackstone affiliate for more than $120 million. In November, BKM and Kayne Anderson also bought a four-building, 105,101-square-foot industrial campus in Pleasant Hill for $25 million. Companies like Zoox, Amazon\u2019s robotaxi company, are\npicking up manufacturing operations\nin cities like Hayward.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sometimes, winning a housing lottery isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nA Newsday newsletter on Tuesday caught my attention with this headline: \u201cA lottery could help some Long Islanders buy a condo for less than $300G.\u201d\nThe story said 16 two-story townhomes in the Beechwood Organization\u2019s 152-home Yaphank development can be purchased at a discount by buyers who meet income guidelines and are selected in the random drawing.\nI immediately thought back to a November story in Newsday about a condo lottery in Westhampton Beach. Winners would pay $535,875 for seven of the 45 homes in an Inland Real Estate Capital development where the listed prices were $1.4 million to $1.8 million.\nQuite a deal, right?\nHowever, of 136 lottery applicants,\nonly two were eligible\n. The earnings limit was 130 percent of the area median income, but some applicants didn\u2019t account for common charges, insurance premiums and other ownership expenses (the kind that tenants typically take for granted).\nYaphank isn\u2019t glamorous like Westhampton Beach, and the discounts for Beechwood\u2019s workforce homes don\u2019t sound as sexy either.\nSeven homes will be sold for $75,000 less than their $371,875 sticker price, a 20 percent discount. Another seven are just $25,000 off their regular price of $445,250, a savings of just 5.6 percent. The two income tiers are 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. (Two of the 16 workforce units will be built later and haven\u2019t been priced yet.)\nNewsday graciously put a puffy, e-mailed quote from Beechwood principal Steven Dubb high up in the article. \u201cOffering below market-rate homes through the lottery system helps us to help first-time new home owners, many who are essential workers, to establish themselves and stay on Long Island for years to come.\u201d\nAbsolutely true. But, reality check: This was a business strategy, not an act of pure altruism.\nAs the story later noted, Beechwood discounted 10 percent of the development\u2019s homes in return for being allowed to build at a higher density than the site\u2019s zoning.\nThis was possible under the Long Island Workforce Housing Act, passed in 2008. It applies to Nassau and Suffolk counties and defines \u201cworkforce\u201d housing as affordable to households earning up to 130 percent of the area median income. Developers can build the workforce units off-site, or not build them at all and pay into a workforce housing fund instead.\nA 2014\naudit\nof 29 developments built under the act flagged several for failing to meet its terms. The developer of a 32-unit project in the Town of Islip forgot to set aside any workforce units \u2014 and town officials forgot to check. The villages of Hempstead and Mineola approved three projects without the required workforce units.\nOne takeaway is that achieving affordability by regulation is possible but far from perfect. The Westhampton Beach lottery where only two applicants were eligible to buy\n$1.8 million homes\ndiscounted 70 percent might be an extreme example, but it shows the difficulty of this process.\nIn other cases, trust fund kids \u2014 just out of college but not earning much money yet \u2014 qualify to buy into affordable co-ops intended for working-class New Yorkers. Bloomberg blew the rich kids\u2019 cover with an\ninvestigative story\nin 2021, but gaming the system is still possible.\nAt one income-restricted co-op in East Harlem, where units are supposed to be owner-occupied, one woman\nacquired seven apartments\nand didn\u2019t live in any of them.\nNew York City in 2017\nmandated affordability\nin rezoned areas, but the law works much better in some neighborhoods (such as\nGowanus\n) than others (\nEast New York\n). A citywide law cannot account for the city\u2019s vastly different individual markets.\nThe quest to regulate affordability in high-demand metro areas such as New York and Los Angeles is enormously complex, inherently flawed and will never end. Meanwhile,\nsome cities\nhave achieved affordability without ever requiring it.\n",

The buyer is New York-based Nuveen Global Investments, deed records show.\nAfter buying the property in 2007, San Antonio Alternative Housing Corporation partnered with the Austin Housing Finance Corporation \u2014 crucially, the property it purchased is in Austin, the same municipality as the corporation \u2014 to issue $10.8 million in bonds to rehab the property.\nThe former owner got tax breaks in exchange for keeping rents affordable.

Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was last valued at $26.4 million by the local appraisal district, which works out to $104,642 per unit.\nTax benefits conferred by Texas housing finance corporations came under fire after reporting showed that apartment owners were partnering with affordable housing entities in far-flung counties to wipe their properties off of local tax rolls.\nLawmakers\nresponded\nwith a crackdown on these so-called \u201ctraveling\u201d tax credits via House Bill 21, which passed in the summer of 2025. Affordable housing developers and advocates say\nit goes too far\nin its creation of new affordability requirements.\nInvestors\u2019 discontent inspired a\nlawsuit\nagainst the new legislation, which has further divided Texas\u2019 affordable housing development community.

The suit, filed in September in Cameron County, remains pending.\nThe fallout of HB 21\u2019s passage is still ongoing.

The applicants are an affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, registered to an attorney in downtown Miami.\nThe site, now home to an 8,000-square-foot post office, is on the west side of Collins Avenue.\nDesigned by Plus architecture firm, the building would consist of 13 four-bedroom units, seven efficiencies, two one-bedroom units and 11 hotel rooms.

Developers also can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t specify how many units would be affordable.\nAcross South Florida, developers have seized on the law with a flurry of projects, but proposals for some small coastal Miami-Dade towns have touched off a firestorm.\nIn barrier islands such as Surfside, Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour, \u201cthe Live Local Act does not give enough weight to the traffic impacts,\u201d said Surfside resident Michael Karukin. \u201cIt also does not give enough weight to what many comprehensive plans refer to as capacity in infrastructure.\u201d\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, Ocean Walk opponents cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its own growth and development fate and preserve its small-town feel.\n\u201cIt takes me about 15 minutes to go 1 mile,\u201d said Surfside resident Robert Lisman. \u201cSurfside was designed to be a small family town, not like Sunny Isles Beach or Miami Beach.\u201d\nAlso a thorn for opponents: The developers propose underground parking, which the town banned in 2024, except for sites on the east side of Collins Avenue, according to the developers\u2019 letter of intent. But in the letter, they invoke\nSenate Bill 180\n, state law passed last year that prohibited local governments from enacting \u201cmore burdensome\u201d development regulations. The law was passed in the aftermath of several hurricanes as a way to remove roadblocks to reconstruction efforts.\nSurfside\u2019s underground parking prohibition \u201cdirectly impedes the redevelopment of the property,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorney, Graham Penn, wrote in the letter. The ordinance \u201cis therefore unenforceable and the applicant will be employing underground parking in the development.\u201d\nOpponents argue that Live Local only applies for sites zoned as commercial, industrial and mixed-use. The Ocean Walk development site\u2019s zoning doesn\u2019t fit under the state law, said Karukin, a former Surfside commissioner. Because of this, the proposal \u201cshould be rejected outright,\u201d he added.\nPenn, Postal Realty and Oren Lieber, the attorney listed as manager of Ocean Walk Surfside, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. It\u2019s unknown whether Postal Realty will partner on the project or sell the site to Ocean Walk Surfside.\nFabi\u00e1n Basabe, a state representative whose district includes much of coastal Miami-Dade, argued that Live Local isn\u2019t a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for projects. The law and Senate Bill 180 are meant to address the need for affordable housing, \u201cwhile intentionally preserving local authority\u201d and giving cities \u201cmeaningful tools\u201d to review and implement projects.\nTown staff members are working on the initial review of the application and will then proceed to more technical reviews, Mario Diaz, acting town manager said in a statement.\nAs for the developers\u2019 invocation of Senate Bill 180 regarding the underground parking ban, \u201cthe town views these positions as legal arguments\u201d and not \u201csettled conclusions,\u201d Diaz said.\nIn Bal Harbour, Surfside\u2019s neighbor to the north, Whitman Family Development\u2019s proposal for a Live Local Act project at its luxury Bal Harbour Shops led to an uproar. The project would add\n275-foot buildings\nwith 600 units, a 70-key hotel and 46,000 square feet of retail. Bal Harbour and Whitman have been locked in\nlitigation\nover the project.\nWhile opponents to Live Local projects tend to agree with its concept to incentivize development of below-market rentals, they take issue with its broad inclusion of all localities across the state, regardless of their own quirks.\n\u201cIt would be like putting up a 50-story affordable housing building on Fisher Island,\u201d Burkett said, referring to the exclusive residential island. \u201cWould that be a good idea, too?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A leading Keller Williams Realty team based in Austin is forming its own brokerage, aiming to claim ground ceded by a merging industry.\nBroker Kasey Jorgenson left Keller Williams to found Jorgenson Real Estate, ending a 16-year career at Austin-based Keller Williams, the largest franchise in the industry by agent count, according to a press release.\nThe Austin Business Journal ranked the Jorgenson Group second in the city from 2019 to 2023. The group totaled $75 million in sales over about 190 transactions in 2025, according to the release.\nAs the brokerage industry\ncoagulates\n, Jorgenson expects industry titans to gradually leave physical offices, presenting an opportunity for independent teams.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how these huge companies that have brick-and-mortar and local support staff \u2014 I don\u2019t see how they can afford to give the agents the value that they should be getting now. Not many Keller Williams market centers are hugely profitable,\u201d Jorgenson said.\nJorgenson Real Estate emerges amid a difficult market for the Austin area. Austin has lost more home value than any other major metropolitan area since its last market peak in 2022, with the median home price dropping to about $490,000 in 2025 from over $575,000 in 2022, according to Zillow. The decline reflects the wane of Austin\u2019s dalliance with the tech industry.\nWhile the Austin market may appear nominally\nbalanced\n, it has a vast, unrepresented share of homeowners who want to sell, but have failed, Jorgenson said.\n\u201cAt multiple points last year, about half of the properties that were active on the market were vacant. And that wasn\u2019t counting new construction,\u201d Jorgenson said. \u201cWe consider them as people that, quote-unquote, have to sell.\u201d\nAdditionally, while Austin\u2019s home inventory only occasionally\nlapped above six months supply last year\n\u2014 the traditional threshold of a buyer\u2019s market \u2014 it had been operating below four months supply\nsince the end of the Great Recession\n.\nA significant number of sellers have decided to rent out their homes instead\n, resulting in a \u201chuge behind-the-scenes\u201d inventory of homes that will return to the market in 2026, Jorgenson believes.\n\u201cWe opened up a property management side because we were tired of sending those people elsewhere. [Renters] saturated the\ncondo market, especially\n,\u201d Jorgensen said.\n",

        "content": "A bankruptcy judge has rejected\nthe city\u2019s bid\nto pause the auction of more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments, clearing the way for a possible takeover by Summit Properties.\nThe apartments were put up for sale as part of a bankruptcy suit connected to Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group. The judge\u2019s decision represents not only a likely change in ownership in New York\u2019s multifamily market but a reminder of the limits to city power when it comes to the dealings of private companies.\nThe Mamdani administration earlier this week had asked for a 30-day pause on the sale to evaluate the transfer to Summit and explore potential alternatives. That followed similar requests from a coalition that included tenants, elected officials and the housing department under Mayor Eric Adams to delay the sale, originally with the hope that a nonprofit or other entity might be able to draw up a workable bid. Mayor Zohran Mamdani had taken things further, publicly championing the cause and vowing to intervene for tenants.\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. Last summer, the company partnered with Savanna to acquire the leasehold at 444 Madison Avenue for $50 million. It offered $451 million for the Pinnacle portfolio as the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder in the auction.\nBut the Mamdani administration\nexpressed concern\nthat Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties with the proposed $451 million sale price. The legal rents on the units are low enough that the company likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nPinnacle\u2019s collection of bankrupt LLCs owes the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, according to court documents. They owe Flagstar Bank more than $564 million, according to court documents.\nThe sale is scheduled for Thursday. The mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKathryn Brenzel contributed reporting to this story.\n",

But the Council argued for a 4.55 percent citywide vacancy rate.\nNoble said the Common Council\u2019s resolution, which cites the 4.55 percent vacancy rate determined by an independent consultant hired by the city\u2019s Office of Housing Initiatives, \u201cmisconstrues aspects of the 2025 vacancy study and contains several factual errors.\u201d Notably, the city\u2019s report did not calculate a city-wide vacancy rate and the consultant only analyzed nine properties for its study.\nThe rent stabilization road in Kingston, which became the first upstate municipality to adopt the tenant protection measure in New York, has been controversial.\nLast August, the state\u2019s Court of Appeals\nrejected\na challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overreached by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings, allowing the reduction to stand and opening the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments, though exemptions and rehab projects cut that total to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units, a measure Noble supports \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The entity is asking the San Francisco Superior Court to order the removal of the occupants from the 1.2-million-square-foot property.\nThe court filings are focused on the owners and operators of shoe store Shoe Wiz, Eyebrow Plus beauty salon and Executive Order Bar &amp; Lounge, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nThe Shoe Wiz store is currently locked with boxes and shelves of merchandise inside, according to the Standard. Eyebrow Plus remains open with plans to close by the end of this month. Executive Order Bar &amp; Grill is also open, though owner John Eric Sanchez hopes to stay as long as he can despite a sharp drop in foot traffic and a $35,000 in monthly rent, he\ntold\nthe San Francisco Chronicle in November.\nIn November, legal counsel for the mall\u2019s owners\nserved tenants with letters\ndeclaring their leases \u201cextinguished\u201d and said they had to vacate. The complaints filed last week kick off a formal eviction process for those that did not leave voluntarily. According to the complaint against Eyebrow Plus, the store was given a three-day notice to leave on Dec. 13; the owner is seeking damages of $201.37 \u201cfor each day [the] defendant continues in possession of the premises and through the time of judgment,\u201d plus a declaration of forfeiture and recovery of lawsuit costs.\nSan Francisco Centre has been\nin a death spiral\nsince previous owners Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties abandoned their post in 2023 after stopping payments on $625.6 million worth of debt on the property. Vacancy is at more than 90 percent and\nfoot traffic fell 63.3 percent\nbetween 2019 and 2024. The mall sold at a foreclosure auction to the DBJPM 2016-SFC Emporium mortgage trust, which owned the original loan on the property, in November for $133 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 397,000-square-foot office tower is slated to be completed in 2028 and will rise next to a 304-unit multifamily building at 111 East Carson Boulevard.\nRiverside paired the debt with $105 million of structured equity from a joint venture involving RXR, One Investment Management and Liberty Mutual Investments, bringing the total capital committed for the phase to $350 million.\nThe financing comes with meaningful\npreleasing\nin hand. In September, Riverside announced that Charlotte-based law firm Moore &amp; Van Allen signed a 15-year lease for 206,000 square feet, more than half of the future office building, the Charlotte Business Journal\nreported\n. Insurance giant Pacific Life has also committed to 68,000 square feet, giving the project early momentum at a time when new office starts remain scarce nationwide.\nThe office tower is part of a larger, multi-tower redevelopment that Riverside has been assembling for years. The firm closed on the 1111 South Tryon site in 2021, which spans multiple parcels and currently houses fixtures like Midnight Diner and Uptown Cabaret. At the time, Riverside said construction on a mixed-use project featuring office, residential, retail and potentially a hotel would begin within a year.\nAltogether, the three-tower Queensbridge Collective is expected to carry total construction costs of up to $750 million, making it one of the more ambitious mixed-use projects in Charlotte\u2019s\nSouth End\ncorridor. South End, anchored by the LYNX Blue Line light rail and a steady influx of apartments and retail, has emerged as an\nactive submarket\nin the city for mixed-use development.\nNearby, Charlotte-based Panorama is adding to the momentum. The firm broke ground last year on The J, an 84-unit residential project at 1718\nSouth Tryon Street\n, with vertical construction now underway.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office building near the former Allstate headquarters campus could soon give way to wedding receptions and corporate galas.\nKehoe Designs President Tom Kehoe is planning to demolish a 106,167-square-foot office building at 2100 Sanders Road in Glenview and replace it with a two-story, 45,000-square-foot event venue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The project would mark a second outpost of the Geraghty, the Pilsen-based venue Kehoe has owned and operated since 2015.\nThe proposal points to a creative redevelopment option for suburban office corridors littered with obsolete buildings that have struggled to attract tenants in the wake of remote work. Glenview has already leaned into that reality, most notably at the former\nAllstate campus\n, which has been remade into a\nsprawling industrial park\nafter the insurance giant decamped.\nKehoe told the outlet that he\u2019s spent years scouting the North Shore for a site to serve clients who have been pushing him to open closer to home. The 5-acre Sanders Road parcel, which borders the Cook County Forest Preserve, checked the right boxes, including ample green space for a venue with both indoor and outdoor components.\nThe existing office building, constructed in 1987 and formerly occupied by IMC Global, is owned by a venture tied to local investor Richard Colburn. Kehoe declined to disclose the purchase price, and the seller declined to comment.\nPending village approvals, Kehoe aims to close on the property and begin demolition this spring, with an eye toward opening the new venue \u2014 dubbed the Geraghty North \u2014 in spring 2027. Plans call for a maximum capacity of 600 guests and a design geared toward social and corporate events, according to a letter sent to neighbors, according to the publication. Kehoe is scheduled to present the project to nearby residents at a meeting hosted by the Glenview Park District, with a formal appearance before the village\u2019s development commission expected later this month.\nThe site sits across from\nCaremark Towers\n, another aging office complex whose owner is pursuing an industrial redevelopment.\nThe hospitality angle is also notable, as full-service hotels nearby once relied heavily on corporate events tied to Allstate\u2019s campus, but that demand cratered after the pandemic. The Hilton Chicago Northbrook, just over a mile away, defaulted on its mortgage after Allstate announced its exit, while the\nCrowne Plaza\nacross the street was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit last year.\nKehoe told the outlet that he sees an opening precisely because nearby options are limited, pointing to strong demand for outdoor-friendly venues.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Steve Croman is facing yet another foreclosure \u2014 and from a familiar foe.\nDalan Real Estate filed separate lawsuits against the\ninfamous\nlandlord over alleged loan defaults tied to seven rental properties in Manhattan, according to court documents. Croman is accused of defaulting on loans totaling roughly $39 million.\nCroman allegedly stopped making payments on the loans a year ago, according to the court filings. One loan is a $4.6 million mortgage tied to 44 Avenue B \u2014 where Croman allegedly owes $4.2 million \u2014 while the other is a $34.2 million mortgage collateralized by a handful of properties: 1345 Amsterdam Avenue, 277 East 10th Street, 279 East 10th Street, 321 West 16th Street, 521 East 5th Street and 52 Barrow Street. Croman allegedly owes $25.1 million on that debt.\nDalan is seeking to foreclose on the properties and have them auctioned. Dalan and Croman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe two parties know each other well.\nLast month, Croman began\nbattling\na UCC sale on his $53 million Upper East Side home, initiated by Dalan. Croman argues the auction is not commercially reasonable, though he allegedly defaulted on a $31 million loan.\nEarlier last year, Dalan\nmoved to foreclose\non four of Croman\u2019s properties that have debt totaling $27.5 million; Dalan purchased a\n$140 million portfolio\nof the landlord\u2019s loans from Axos Bank in October 2024.\nIt\u2019s another headache for Croman, whose lenders are together trying to foreclose on more than $231 million in loan principal. Croman is also in the midst of a\nfight with his father,\nEdward Croman, who is trying to dissolve the family partnerships, alleging mismanagement.\nCroman the younger is one of the only New York landlords to have been sent to prison for real estate-related crimes. Once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords, Croman served eight months in state prison related to mortgage and tax fraud and paid $8 million in restitution related to accusations of tenant harassment.\n",

Only a few hotels are beating that trend, such as the oceanfront Surfrider in Malibu. Luxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe small Malibu hotel for $37.5 million from Dauntless Capital Partners. It was the priciest per-key deal of 2025 at about $1.9 million a room, and one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever.\nCapital Insight owns other hotels and motels throughout Southern California, in Anaheim, Thousand Oaks and Los Angeles, according to its website. That includes the shuttered Four Points by Sheraton, near Los Angeles International Airport, which Capital Insight intends to convert to\naffordable housing\n.\nCapital Insight\u2019s proposal for the former hotel \u2014 three interconnected, mid-century buildings with more than 560 rooms \u2014 is to turn it into 572 one-bedroom apartments. Of those, 229 units would be reserved for renters earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.\nBeyond the hotel world, Blackstone, early last year,\nacquired 93 shopping centers\nacross the West Coast, including eight in Southern California when it acquired the Retail Opportunity Investment Corporation for $4 billion.\n",

Gavin Newsom\nis allocating more than $100 million in state funds to build affordable homes for victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nOn Tuesday, the day before Los Angeles marked the one-year anniversary of the deadly wildfires, Newsom announced that $107.3 million in state money will be set aside to create 665 affordable rental units that will be offered first to those affected or displaced by the fires, according to Westside Current\nreporting\nand\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s calculations.\nThe money comes from a\nMultifamily Finance Super NOFA\n, or notice of funding of application, issued by the California Department of Housing and Community Development last February. A separate statewide Multifamily Finance Super NOFA announced in September provided nearly $56.9 million for four other developments with 301 affordable rental residences in fire-impacted areas across Los Angeles County. The September NOFA allowed developers in local jurisdictions to request funding from multiple state housing programs through a single application, in turn expediting the development of new homes.\nThe funding from the February NOFA will support the construction of nine multifamily projects across Los Angeles County. On the Westside, they include the 80-unit Tierra Apartments in Santa Monica, the 40-unit U.S. Vets-WLAVA building at the\nWest Los Angeles VA campus\nand the 176-unit Crenshaw Crossing development next to the Expo/Crenshaw Metro station. On the east side, the funding will support the 43-unit La Guadalupe project in Boyle Heights as well as the 100-unit Ramona housing project for seniors in Pasadena and 44-unit Colorado Crest Apartments, also in\nPasadena\n.\nElsewhere in L.A. County, a 50-unit complex at 15804 Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, a 59-unit senior apartment complex at 233 North Second Avenue in Covina and the 73-unit Mercy Claremont project in Claremont will also get construction financial aid from the NOFA.\nThe developments benefiting from the new NOFA aren\u2019t in burn scar areas and will not replace destroyed homes. Newsom emphasized that the state is \u201crebuilding stronger, fairer communities in Los Angeles without displacing the people who call these neighborhoods home.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The new Agency office opened Tuesday at 14140 Southwest Freeway, marking the brokerage\u2019s first office in the Houston market.\nUmansky\n, best known for starring in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d and his ties to Bravo\u2019s \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d universe, founded The Agency in 2011. Since then, he\u2019s built the firm into a global luxury brand with more than 150 offices across 14 countries. Expansion has been brisk: The Agency\nlaunched\n27 offices in 2025 alone, according to the outlet, with more in the pipeline.\nHouston has long been on the company\u2019s shortlist. The Agency already operates in other major Texas metros, including Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, and Umansky has pitched the state as a market with durable fundamentals and room for long-term growth, he told the publication.\nThe Sansone Group is led by Chris and Lizz Sansone, who founded the team in 2000 and have spent 24 years under the Re/Max umbrella. Their nine-agent operation ranked No. 10 among small residential teams in the publication\u2019s 2025 Residential Real Estate Awards, logging $78.2 million in sales across the Greater Houston area.\nThe pairing began with a chance meeting at a Houston Association of Realtors event and evolved into a franchise deal that gives the Sansones ownership of the first Agency outpost in Houston. Lizz Sansone described the move as a \u201clegacy\u201d play after decades with the same brokerage, citing alignment around culture, service and branding.\nThe Agency\u2019s arrival adds to a growing cast of personality-driven brokerages in Houston. White House Global Properties Chairman Washington Ho, star of HBO Max\u2019s \u201cHouse of Ho,\u201d already\nclaims a slice\nof the city\u2019s reality TV\u2013meets\u2013real estate overlap.\nWhile Umansky\u2019s\npersonal r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nleans heavily toward trophy deals, The Agency has been clear that it\u2019s not chasing only ultra-luxury listings. The Sansone Group\u2019s inventory spans from entry-level homes to multimillion-dollar properties, reflecting Houston\u2019s broad housing mix.\nThe firm was also drawn to Sugar Land specifically for its schools, planning and quality of life, Umansky said, positioning the suburb as a stable launchpad rather than a flashy inner-loop debut.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That price point represented an 18 percent premium on what the stock traded at before the deal was announced, but well below the $14 initial public offering in 2021.\nBillionaire Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa entity were set to roll over their existing stake and retain majority control of the new company, according to a press release when the deal was announced.\nMorse was set to snag a seat on the board as vice chairman. Actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher was part of a group chipping in new equity capital and joined the board, while Apollo Global Management was said to be refinancing roughly $700 million in debt.\nNow, everything is up in the air. MCR and Soho House could not be reached for comment by the publication.\nBurkle and his firm aren\u2019t throwing in the towel, yet.\n\u201cYucaipa and the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, together with their respective advisors, are engaging with affiliates of MCR, as well as other parties, to secure the funding,\u201d according to the funding, adding that success was not guaranteed.\nSoho House counts 46 locations and more than 200,000 members on its books. The company is credited with leading the wave of members-only clubs that have become a staple of the New York City social scene, snapping up buildings and long-term leases in recent years.\nThe company, founded in 1995, paved the way for clubs like Casa Cipriani, Zero Bond and Aman New York.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The storied St. Regis Houston has a new owner \u2014 and a new identity \u2014 as local businessman Leslie Doggett moves deeper into hospitality with plans for a ground-up refresh of the luxury hotel between River Oaks and the Galleria.\nDoggett, whose family empire\nLeslie Doggett Industries\nspans industrial equipment and car dealerships, acquired the hotel at 1919 Briar Oaks Lane and is planning a multimillion-dollar renovation over the next two years, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was not disclosed, and Doggett declined to share the purchase price.\nThe acquisition marks a personal and strategic pivot for Doggett, who said the hotel\u2019s revival is as much emotional as it is financial. He and his wife spent their wedding night there in 1984, when the property was known as The Remington. \u201cThe hotel has excellent bones,\u201d Doggett told the outlet, \u201cbut it just needs a few upgrades.\u201d\nAs part of the deal, the hotel will exit the St. Regis flag \u2014 operated by Marriott International \u2014 and rebrand under Marriott\u2019s Luxury Collection as The Houston Grand Hotel \u2014 River Oaks. Doggett told the outlet that the property is not affiliated with the nearby\nSt. Regis Residences\nHouston condo project.\nOpened in 1982, the hotel later became Houston\u2019s first\nRitz-Carlton\nand famously hosted Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 before losing the Ritz flag in 1997. Doggett\u2019s vision is to restore what he calls the city\u2019s \u201cgrandest hotel experience,\u201d with a family-owned approach.\nRenovations are expected to be designed this year and completed by the end of 2027, overseen by Saddlebrook Equity and Management, an arm of Doggett\u2019s broader business. Connecticut-based HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts has taken over management.\nPlans start with a dramatic lobby overhaul: tearing down walls, restoring 12-foot ceiling heights by removing the current drop ceilings and opening up back-of-house space to create a more theatrical arrival. The reimagined ground floor is slated to include a coffee shop, a barber shop, a restaurant replacing The Remington, a gun shop, a spirits-heavy lounge and other experiential touches Doggett believes guests are craving.\nDoggett told the outlet that the location is nonnegotiable. \u201cThis area is ground zero for Houston hotels,\u201d he said.\nGuest rooms across all 12 floors will be renovated in phases to avoid a full closure, while the property\u2019s event spaces, fitness center and pool deck are also in line for major upgrades. New York-based designer Charlotte Moss is leading interiors.\nDoggett is also partnering on a planned mixed-use development nearby that could bring a 50-story condo-hotel tower and office space to\nPost Oak Boulevard\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players are locked in a legal fight over a UCC sale tied to\nWorldwide Plaza\n.\nOwners SL Green and RXR are asking a New York judge to stop what they call a \u201csham auction\u201d by an entity tied to Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development that aims to wrest control of the debt on the 1.8-million-square-foot office tower at 825 Eighth Avenue.\nIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, the landlords accused Barnett of engineering a rigged UCC foreclosure to seize control of the ongoing restructuring of the $940 million CMBS senior mortgage on the 49-story tower. They are asking a judge to stop the\nJanuary 15 sale\n.\nBarnett claims to own a $190 million mezzanine loan tied to the property and has scheduled a public auction of the controlling entity. But the landlords say Extell has never shown any proof that it actually owns the loan, despite repeated requests. The owners received a default notice in October from Barnett, according to the suit.\nAccording to the complaint, the foreclosure effort is not a genuine attempt to recover on the mezzanine debt but a control play orchestrated by Barnett to give Extell leverage in the ongoing debt restructuring, claiming that Extell has a direct interest in the bonds backed by the tower.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the property.\nAn Extell spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWorldwide Plaza is an iconic, well-located asset, and we are ready to execute a robust redevelopment plan that will create an incredible offering in the heart of Midtown,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said. \u201cThe complaint reveals the lender\u2019s underhanded attempt to interfere with the revitalization of the building and the tenants in our property.\u201d\nKorea-based Shinhan Financial Group provided $190 million of mezzanine debt on the building in 2017. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest remaining tenant \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The leftover 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, down\n80 percent\nfrom its 2017 $1.7 billion valuation, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to cause $500 million of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nLast month, Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt. The special servicer is reportedly negotiating with the borrower regarding a loan modification, according to Morningstar.\n",

        "content": "In the aftermath of the passage of the 2019 rent laws, some prominent real estate leaders still didn\u2019t know the name of a person key to orchestrating what one landlord referred to as a \u201chorror show.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they know who I am? Ego and confidence,\u201d Cea Weaver\ntold The Real Deal\na few months after the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act became law.\nOf course, Weaver is no longer a stranger to the industry.\nThe renter activist was one of Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s first appointments after he was sworn in as mayor, naming her as the director of the newly revived Office to Protect Tenants. In recent days, news articles have highlighted her past posts on social media, leading to a flurry of attacks from the right and testimonials of her advocacy work from the left.\nBut ever since 2019, more real estate insiders have become aware of Weaver and the bloc she represents. Weaver and her organization, Housing Justice for All, have been a driving force behind policy initiatives most feared by the real estate industry, including the\nHSTPA\n, demands for canceling rent during the pandemic, good cause eviction, expansion of rent regulation throughout the state and calls for freezing the rent.\nIn the lead-up to the HSTPA, Weaver\u2019s coalition appealed directly to lawmakers, who reached a two-way deal without then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Despite\npleas\nfrom real estate executives to veto the bill, Cuomo signed it into law.\nNot all of these efforts have been successful. Rent wasn\u2019t canceled, and though the state legislature passed good cause eviction in\n2024\n, Weaver and other advocates complained that the approved version was\nwatered down\n. The Rent Guidelines Board declined to freeze rents last year, but the new mayor has vowed to do so for the next four years.\nIn the spotlight\nWeaver served as a housing adviser to Mamdani during his mayoral campaign and as part of the newly launched New York State Tenant Bloc, mobilized tenants last year to only support mayoral candidates who supported a rent freeze.\nShe\u2019s also periodically drawn the industry\u2019s ire with\nsocial media posts\nabout rent regulation and other far-left priorities, though not to the extent seen this week.\nSocial media and news sites erupted this week over some of Weaver\u2019s old tweets. One of her posts, from 2017, referred to homeownership as \u201ca weapon of white supremacy masquerading as \u2018wealth building\u2019 public policy.\u201d\nWhen asked about the post, Mayor Zohran Mamdani defended his selection of Weaver for the Office to Protect Tenants, saying she was hired \u201cbased on the track record that she had of standing up for tenants across the city in the state.\u201d He\u2019s also said he\u2019s committed to providing stability for homeowners and would-be homeowners alongside tenants.\nDuring interviews with NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, Weaver said the phrasing of the old social media posts was \u201cinelegant\u201d and \u201cregretful.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly do not think that all homeownership is white supremacy,\u201d she\ntold Louis\non his podcast this week, adding that she was referring to longstanding\ninequities\nin homeownership.\nLast year, as part of a\nTRD\n\u2019s magazine feature,\nThe Debate\n, Weaver defended rent stabilization as a way to provide predictability to renters in the same way that fixed-rate mortgages help property owners.\n\u201cRenters should have access to the same stability, especially as homeownership \u2014 always a myth, but a potent one \u2014 becomes unattainable for millions,\u201d wrote at the time.\nLongtime contentious figure\nThis week was not the first time that Weaver has faced backlash at the prospect of holding a government position. In 2021, she was\nnominated\nto the City Planning Commission, but withdrew her name amid opposition.\nIn her new role with the Office to Protect Tenants, Weaver will ensure that \u201cpro-tenant policy is moved into every aspect of the administration\u2019s housing agenda,\u201d she told Louis.\nThe office, alongside other city agencies, will host \u201c\nRental Ripoff\n\u201d hearings focused on \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d\nMamdani has repeatedly committed to addressing owners\u2019 costs through property tax reform and other initiatives, such as alternative insurance models, though he hasn\u2019t released many details on how to pursue those actions. Rent stabilization reform would need to happen at the state level, and lawmakers have shown little interest in taking up the issue.\nWeaver\u2019s old tweets have become a proxy fight over fears of what lies in store in the Mamdani administration and to what extent socialist policies take hold. (The City Council\u2019s new Republican minority leader, David Carr, quoted Weaver\u2019s tweets during a meeting on Wednesday and talked about the threat of \u201csmothering collectivism\u201d to property rights and individual liberties.)\nWhile his initial actions as mayor targeted \u201cbad landlords,\u201d Mamdani also\nsigned executive orders\naimed at finding ways to speed up housing construction. Ahead of the election, some affordable housing developers said they were hopeful about the mayor\u2019s plans to build 200,000 housing units over the next decade.\nWeaver has also voiced support for ramping up housing construction in the city. She publicly supported housing\nballot measures\nbefore Mamdani confirmed that he was voting for them. She also warned against housing regulation bills that housing groups argued would thwart the new mayor\u2019s housing plan.\n",

        "content": "Fred Seigel\u2019s commercial real estate firm Beacon Capital Partners is accused of abandoning its commitment to fund a series of biotech incubators, jeopardizing leases in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market and elsewhere across the country.\nChicago-based incubator firm Portal Innovations filed a lawsuit against Boston-based Beacon, its joint venture partner, last month, alleging the firm failed to follow through on agreements to fund the startup\u2019s operations in four U.S. cities, including Chicago. Beacon owns significant Chicago office properties, including one in the midst of a\n$370 million foreclosure dispute\n, and recently\ntook a loss on a LaSalle Street office sale\nin the Loop.\nPortal\u2019s litigation underscores fears that life sciences investments became over-saturated during and just after the pandemic.\nPortal currently occupies a 53,000-square-foot workspace in Trammell Crow\u2019s lab office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market. Portal is also a partner at the University of Chicago Polsky Center\u2019s life sciences incubator at\nHyde Park Labs\n, a 13-story commercial building at 5207 South Harper Avenue developed by Beacon and Trammell.\nBeacon, along with its key financial backer, California Teachers Retirement System, had an agreement to fund Portal\u2019s \u201claunchpads\u201d in Chicago, Atlanta, Houston and Boston so that Portal could use its \u201cexpertise\u201d at helping early stage startups with their real estate, equipment and capital requirements, the lawsuit says. The retirement fund owned 98 percent of the Beacon entities\u2019 stakes in the Portal projects at issue, according to the litigation.\nBut at some point in 2024, Beacon and the California teachers \u201clost interest\u201d in life sciences and began refusing to fund capital calls as agreed upon between the investors and Portal, the suit claims.\nSince the dispute began, Portal\u2019s locations across the U.S. have struggled to keep up with bills, including lease payments, the lawsuit alleges. In some locations, including Boston and Houston, Portal launchpads are at risk of shutting down imminently, the filing claims.\nMuch of Portal\u2019s lawsuit against Beacon is redacted, but it states Beacon refused to fund capital calls unless Portal \u201creworked its contractual obligations.\u201d The suit doesn\u2019t specify Beacon\u2019s demands within the un-redacted portions of the lawsuit, but Portal claims Beacon is trying to remove Portal as manager of their joint ventures. Beacon\u2019s refusal throughout 2025 to further fund Portal has caused their joint ventures to lose out on adding prospective members to their rosters at their various lab leases, Portal\u2019s suit claims.\n\u201cThe larger impact is the reputational damage in the life science market, as [Beacon\u2019s] actions have made it appear that [Portal] and the joint venture companies are untrustworthy partners that back out of deals at the last minute,\u201d Portal said in its suit.\nRepresentatives of Portal and Beacon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nBeacon filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit late last month, revealing more details about the fight \u2014 and claiming Portal\u2019s financial performance has been \u201cdismal,\u201d with losses of over $50 million posted by their joint ventures.\nOver the past few years, life science offices have seen a decrease in interest from the commercial real estate sector amid fears they were overbuilt during the pandemic when traditional office demand imploded. As the general office market continues to recover, investors are less keen to replace their hopes with life sciences.\nIn 2024, Chicago-based\nFulton Street Companies pivoted from developing a life sciences project\nto building a two-tower complex with over 1,000 housing units at 1200 West Fulton Street. Furthermore, investors in developer Sterling Bay\u2019s 285,000-square-foot life sciences building next to the\nfailed Lincoln Yards megaproject parcels\nare poised to take a loss. The property remains vacant and is set to be sold in a bid to cover construction debt funded by Bank OZK. Plus, a separate\n$265 million Bank OZK loan note\nbacking another vacant life sciences property that Sterling built in San Diego was offloaded this week by the lender to another buyer.\nIn Cook County Court in Illinois, Beacon\u2019s motion to dismiss claims Portal\u2019s only capital calls at issue were two rounds totaling just $900,000. Beacon also alleges that it and its partners have invested over $52 million in the Portal joint ventures, plus over $42 million in tenant improvement costs to help build out their workspaces.\nBeacon argues it had no obligation to fund the recent capital calls because Portal failed to secure approval for a 2025 annual budget, a contractual prerequisite for demanding cash. Beacon further alleges the entities have lost about $50.5 million to date, while significantly missing revenue projections.\nThe filing accuses Portal of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d claiming the incubator firm improperly used joint venture funds to pay itself excessive management fees and cover costs for unrelated businesses. Beacon asserts it exercised its right to remove Portal as the manager of the joint ventures last month \u2014 a few days before Portal filed its lawsuit \u2014 due to these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.\nBeacon further denies that the leases are in immediate jeopardy, stating the joint ventures currently hold about $2.5 million in cash on hand. Regarding the Fulton Market site specifically, Beacon argues it has already met its $15 million contribution cap and has no obligation to provide more funding.\nA hearing on each of the litigants\u2019 various motions is set for 10 a.m. Monday in courtroom 2408 at the Richard J. Daley Center in Chicago, online records show.\n",

        "content": "A Clybourn Corridor retail building that traded at a fire-sale price is starting to fill up, with Farpoint Development and MCZ Development landing a major national tenant.\nT.J. Maxx signed a lease for 26,000 square feet of street-level space at 939 West North Avenue, according to a press release, giving the off-price retailer street-level space at the southeast corner of North Avenue and Sheffield Avenue. The store is slated to open this fall under a 10-year lease, the release shows.\nThe deal marks a milestone for Chicago-based Farpoint and MCZ, which bought the roughly 200,000-square-foot property at auction in\nFebruary 2024\nfor about $20 million from Iowa-based Principal Financial Group. The price equated to $100 per square foot \u2014 less than a quarter of what it fetched in 2004, when it sold for $89 million. At the\ntime of the purchase\n, its nearly 95,400 square feet of retail space was just 15 percent leased, while the roughly 104,000 square feet of upper-floor medical office and fitness component was 88 percent occupied, according to CBRE data previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe building, built in 2002, currently houses tenants including Fitness Formula Clubs, Iteld Plastic Surgery and Urban Oasis Massage. MCZ has been investing in upgrades, including a refreshed facade and modernized amenities, as part of a repositioning aimed at drawing higher traffic retail to complement the existing health and wellness uses, according to the release.\nMid-America Real Estate brokers Paul Bryant and Jaime Bertsche represented Farpoint in the lease, while Metro Commercial Real Estate\u2019s Gary Greenfield and Steven Baer represented T.J. Maxx.\nFarpoint principal Alex Katz said in the statement that landing the discount retailer confirmed the firm\u2019s confidence in the building\u2019s location.\nT.J. Maxx operates about two dozen locations across the Chicago area, including downtown and nearby Lakeview, according to the retailer\u2019s website.\nThe lease follows a recent pattern for Farpoint, which has been scooping up high-profile retail properties at distressed prices and backfilling them with brand-name tenants. The firm recently announced deals to bring a\nJPMorgan Chase flagship\nand luxury chocolatier Hotel Chocolat to the building at\n830 North Michigan Avenue\n, another once-troubled retail property it acquired at a steep discount.\n",

        "content": "It would be an understatement to say there\u2019s little optimism that Albany lawmakers will do something good for real estate this session.\nKilling the 485x wage rules would create thousands more apartments, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Gov. Kathy Hochul and others defying construction unions \u2014 who basically wrote the rules \u2014 in an election year.\nWith the governor and everyone else focused on affordability, I would also be shocked if lawmakers allow higher rent increases to renovate rent-stabilized apartments, even as\ntens of thousands sit vacant\n.\nWhat about a new tax break or direct funding for apartment improvements? Don\u2019t count on it. Expanding child care is a much higher priority for lawmakers, and it will be expensive. Other funding will go toward offsetting federal cuts. Little will be left for buildings.\nIn another bad break for rent-stabilized owners, Linda Rosenthal\nisn\u2019t running\nfor the state Senate seat being vacated by Brad Hoylman-Sigal. That means she will remain chair of the Assembly Housing Committee, where she is a huge impediment to any reform seen as helping landlords.\nSome legislators are interested in bringing down insurance premiums, not so much to help landlords but because politicians like to go after big corporations. Insurance companies, which have jacked up their rates, would seem like a fine target.\nBut going after them is like stabbing Jell-O with a fork. They are already regulated by the Department of Financial Services, and most probably donate to legislators who sit on the relevant committees.\nMore importantly, if carriers feel they\u2019re taking on too much risk or being treated unfairly by the government, they simply stop writing policies. When insurers withdraw from a particular area or stop covering a certain class of buildings, the remaining insurers can charge more.\nI\u2019m a homeowner who has never filed an insurance claim. Yet insurers have canceled or declined to renew my policy several times. In what other industry do businesses regularly abandon their customers?\n\u201cHello, this is Equinox. We thank you for being a loyal customer, but we\u2019re declining to renew your gym membership.\u201d\nNever gonna happen.\nThe political strategy, therefore, is not to punish insurers but to attract them, to increase competition and add options for building owners.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOne landlord predicts state legislators will make things worse, not better, for owners this session. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pass\na ton of new rules\n,\u201d tweeted WestHarlm.\nA tenant who WestHarlm discovered illegally rents two rent-stabilized units threatened in front of eight witnesses to kill and then behead him. The landlord called 311 four times to file a complaint but was told there is no mechanism to do so. Tenants, he noted, have 11 harassment claims from which to choose.\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: It\u2019s notoriously hard to build anything in California, be it housing or high-speed rail. But when a devastating fire or earthquake hits, California suspends bureaucratic obstacles to quickly build back what was destroyed. Check out Kari Hamanaki\u2019s\nstory\nin\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s January magazine on how things are progressing one year after fires ravaged Los Angeles. (Here\u2019s the\nInstagram post\nand the\nLinkedIn post\n.) It\u2019s hard not to think that California\u2019s housing shortage could be eliminated if treated with the same urgency.\nElsewhere\u2026\nDespite some\nnews coverage\n, few people noticed when, two days before Christmas, a garbage truck in East Harlem caused a scaffolding collapse that killed a woman.\nTo my knowledge, no one has estimated how many lives have been saved by Local Law 11, which triggered an epidemic of sidewalk sheds in an effort to prevent fatalities from falling debris.\nAny such analysis, which should certainly be done, must also take into account how many people lose their lives in scaffolding collapses. It\u2019s rare, but then, so were deaths from falling debris before Local Law 11. They remain rare in cities that don\u2019t have an equivalent law.\nThe Adams administration made progress in reducing the number of sheds, but no one will ever acknowledge that it might not make sense to try to prevent every death from a particular kind of accident. The\nconsequences\nof such an effort \u2014 including the use of resources that would otherwise go toward other needs \u2014 have to be measured as well.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.73 million\nfor a 2,524-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at The Cortland, 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of CORE had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$71 million\nfor a 66,893-square-foot, mixed-use property at 410 West 13th Street in the Meatpacking District. TP Angelo Gordon purchased the property from British firm Epic.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$26.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot condominium unit at 1110 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Eva Penson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Parks paid $2.5 million for the site in 2006, and the home was completed in 2009. It hit the market in December with an asking price of $25 million.

        "content": "Billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s plan to add cabanas and waterslides at his iconic Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort could be swept away next month.\nTwo city elected officials, including Mayor Steven Meiner, joined a grassroots coalition of residents, activists and preservationists in opposing\nSoffer\u2019s controversial proposal\nto add a towering water park-style amenity to the historic 1,593-room hotel\u2019s pool deck, ratcheting up pressure on the city\u2019s Historic Preservation Board days before a crucial vote on Feb. 10.\nThe 22-acre landmark is at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n.\nMeiner posted an image of the planned pool renovations on his Instagram account along with a long caption on why he\u2019s against it, following a Zoom meeting of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association this week.\n\u201cThe resident outcry against this project over traffic, noise, and neighborhood impacts has been understandably loud, and I share these concerns,\u201d Meiner wrote.\nIn a phone interview with\nThe Real Deal\n,\nMeiner\nsaid the Fontainebleau proposal triggered one of the largest waves of constituent outreach he\u2019s experienced, and that the feedback has been overwhelmingly negative.\n\u201cIt is hard to find a resident who is supportive of the project,\u201d Meiner said.\nMeiner and his city commission colleagues won\u2019t get to decide the fate of Soffer\u2019s plan, however. That duty falls on the historic preservation board, which in November delayed voting on the planned renovation to give Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\ntime to tweak the height and size of a cabana structure and a concrete tower connected to a network of waterslides.\nMeiner said that his and residents\u2019 objections center on traffic, safety and environmental impacts, and that nothing he heard during the MidBeach Neighborhood Association meeting changed his mind.\nFontainebleau Development reduced the height of the cabana structure to two stories from three stories and slashed the waterslide tower from 12 stories to 10 stories, updated renderings and plans show.\nFontainebleau Development\ndefended its revisions in a statement, saying the revised project incorporates community input and feedback from the first Historic Preservation Board meeting.\u00a0 Fontainebleau Development senior vice president Anthony Stahl said in the Zoom meeting that the poolside upgrades will help boost nightly room rates and fund upkeep of the property\u2019s main historic building designed by the late Miami Beach architect, Morris Lapidus.\nStahl repeatedly downplayed opponents\u2019 assertions that Fontainebleau Development is creating a destination water park that will be open to the general public. He insisted that the slides and amenities are meant for hotel guests rather than day visitors. However, Stahl acknowledged that day passes to use the resort\u2019s amenities would include access to the waterslides.\nHe framed the overhaul as a pivot away from the \u201cspring breaker party scene\u201d toward a more family-friendly, high-end environment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have adults popping bottles, partying, loud music,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThe intent is for all that to go away.\u201d\nNeighborhood leaders questioned Fontainebleau\u2019s assurances.\nMarc Weiss, an attorney who lives in the city, called the plan \u201cthe greatest threat facing Miami Beach today.\u201d\nWeiss claimed he was able to place an online day pass order for 90 adults and 90 children for the existing pool, arguing that the new amenity will inevitably function as an attraction open to the public.\n\u201cTheme parks bring a ratchet crowd,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s tacky.\u201d\nCity Commissioner Tonya Bhatt derided the pool renovations.\n\u201cMorris Lapidus would be turning in his grave,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cWe are united, we are angry, we are going to fight this\u2026This is unthinkable.\u201d",

Property records show Scott and Laura Gilbert sold the 6,300-square-foot condo. The Gilberts paid $5.7 million, or about $2,200 per square foot, for the unit in 2011.\nIt was most recently asking nearly $16 million.

The 1926-built beach club was restored.\nThe Ashleys\u2019 Edgewater condo has four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, spanning 3,300 square feet. The asking price works out to $1,700 per square foot. They purchased the unit in 2021 for $2.7 million, when the project was still under construction by Two Roads Development.\nThe building features interiors by French designer Jean-Louis Deniot, whose portfolio includes the Waldorf Astoria Residences in New York. The unit has a private elevator, 10-foot ceilings and two terraces overlooking Biscayne Bay and Miami Beach.\nMarket America was founded in 1992 and grew into a global e-commerce and product brokerage platform.

        "content": "Kane County is poised to step into the short-term rental debate, with county officials set to vote next week on a package of regulations aimed at Airbnb and Vrbo-style rentals in unincorporated areas.\nThe proposed rules are headed to the northeastern Illinois county\u2019s board for a final vote Tuesday after months of committee debate, resident testimony and revisions prompted by complaints about noise, parking and safety. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat if approved, the ordinance would mark the county\u2019s first formal framework for regulating short-term rentals \u2014 a growing slice of the housing market that\u2019s increasingly colliding with suburban quality of life concerns.\nThe push gained momentum last fall, when residents from a quiet cul-de-sac urged the county to intervene. Susan Blassick told the county\u2019s Development Committee in October that a nearby short-term rental had brought loud parties, party buses and clogged street parking to her block.\n\u201cWe all bought homes here because of the serene environment,\u201d she said at the meeting, \u201cnever envisioning that a short-term rental would be on our street.\u201d\nIn response, Kane County staff drafted amendments to the county code that would require short-term rentals to obtain a license from the Development and Community Services Department and comply with a long list of operational standards. Similar debates are playing out\nacross the region\n. St. Charles opted for new\ntaxes and regulations\nlast year; Lake County banned short-term rentals in unincorporated areas, while Skokie and\nChicago\nhave explored tighter controls.\nUnder the Kane County proposal, operators would pay a $200 licensing fee, cap occupancy at two guests per bedroom with a maximum of 16 guests, and limit rentals to 12 contracts or 180 rental days per year, whichever is greater. Commercial vehicles would be barred, as would parking campers, food trucks or portable hot tubs.\nOwners\nwould also need to provide proof of insurance, pass safety inspections, test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and designate a 24-hour local contact.\nThe ordinance would require owners to notify adjoining neighbors by mail before the first rental of each year and post the license visibly inside the property. Violations could result in license suspension or revocation, while operating without a license could trigger fines of up to $1,000. Enforcement would fall to the Kane County Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the publication.\nNot everyone is satisfied. One community member urged county leaders this week to halt the measure, arguing it effectively legitimizes short-term rentals rather than curbing them. County officials counter that an outright ban wouldn\u2019t touch existing rentals and would leave them unregulated.\nAfter clearing the Executive Committee on Wednesday, the ordinance \u2014 as well as companion measures on noise and trespassing \u2014 are now headed to the full board.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An affiliate of Blackrock sold the one-story structure at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street.\nThe Christy Street industrial building was built in 1991 and spans 253,500 square feet. Current tenants include electronics manufacturing services provider Sanmina and\ndata center\nliquid cooling system provider DeepCoolAI.\n\u201cThe explosive growth of the AI, power management, electric vehicle, aerospace and defense industries has generated significant and enduring demand for institutional-quality industrial space across Silicon Valley,\u201d Michael Alderman, managing director at Tishman Speyer, said in a press release. \u201cWe were drawn to Christy Street as a part of our core plus strategy for its strong in-place tenancy, quality floorplate, substantial power and parking and the opportunity to gain a foothold in the supply-constrained Fremont submarket.\u201d\nThe purchase marks another industrial space buy in Fremont, which is emerging as a hotspot for such space in the East Bay and the Bay Area at large.\nIn June, Prologis, the world\u2019s largest owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, purchased an empty 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. The following month,\nconstruction began on the Campus at Bayside\n, an industrial complex spanning 473,250 square feet being developed by CBRE, Clarion Partners and 9th Street Partners.\nSan Francisco-based Prologis previously bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial and research building at 48350 Fremont Boulevard in August 2023 from Blackstone for $86.6 million. Later that month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\nTishman Speyer is active in the Bay Area, developing the Mission Rock office and retail hub in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood. The global firm also owns industrial real estate within the city of San Francisco. In 2023, Tishman Speyer\nbought a nearly 2.9-acre industrial site\nnear San Francisco\u2019s Bayview neighborhood for almost $32.3 million.

        "content": "Federal regulators are circling an Austin-based real estate operator already under siege from investors.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Alan Stalcup, founder and CEO of GVA Real Estate Group, following a wave of lawsuits alleging he misappropriated as much as $100 million from investors. The Austin American-Statesman\nreported\nthat the probe adds a new layer of risk for the multifamily debt syndicator.\nThe existence of the SEC investigation surfaced after Jackson Walker, a law firm representing a family\nsuing Stalcup for fraud\n, disclosed it had been served with an SEC subpoena in October seeking documents tied to the case. According to the outlet, a Texas judge later ordered the records turned over to law enforcement.\nWhile the SEC does not publicly confirm investigations, an attorney for Jackson Walker wrote in a court filing that \u201cbased on the SEC subpoena, it appears the SEC is investigating Mr. Stalcup for securities fraud.\u201d\nStalcup previously told the publication that he welcomed an SEC investigation into what he described as \u201cdefamatory fictions\u201d in the lawsuits.\nFounded in 2015, GVA operates as a property manager and\ndebt syndicator\n, pooling investor capital to acquire underperforming apartment complexes. Many of those investment vehicles are registered with the SEC as securities.\nCourt filings say Stalcup and GVA own or operate roughly 150 apartment properties, primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky. According to his firm\u2019s website, it has acquired 43,000 units across nine states and closed $10 billion in transactions since its founding.\nLegal trouble accelerated last year as rising interest rates strained floating-rate debt and exposed cracks in GVA\u2019s capital stack. In June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital\nsued Stalcup\n, accusing him of mismanaging three properties and allowing\nliens to pile up\nin violation of loan guarantees. In February, Benefit Street Partners filed suit in New York, alleging Stalcup misappropriated insurance proceeds, commingled tenant funds and engaged in other misconduct.\nAcross more than half a dozen lawsuits, investors claim Stalcup blurred the lines between properties and treated company accounts like a \u201cpersonal piggy bank.\u201d One complaint filed by attorneys for investor Brian Kastleman alleges more than $38 million was spent on personal expenses, including private jet travel, yacht charters and luxury vehicles. Other suits accuse GVA of inflating rental income and falsifying financials to mask deteriorating performance.\nOne filing alleges that in 2023 alone, GVA overstated rental income across its portfolio by more than $20.6 million. Another accuses Stalcup of improperly moving $650,000 between accounts tied to different properties he controlled, according to the publication.\nStalcup has pushed back, filing several counterclaims, including one that accuses Kastleman of trying to tank GVA\u2019s reputation to claw back capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Department of Real Estate conducted an investigation into the matter and concluded that McHarg had purposely done so to lift the information from the exams for educational materials offered by his Real Estate Trainers Incorporated for\nstudents\npreparing to take the state\u2019s\nreal estate license exam\n.\nAs part of the settlement, McHarg is barred for three years from applying for, taking, or participating in any way in an examination for a\nCalifornia real estate\nlicense and is prohibited from holding any position of employment, instructor, management, control or ownership in a real estate business or a business that offers pre-license, continuing education or any type of real estate license exam preparation courses. McHarg himself is barred from holding a real estate license, according to the press release. The state Department of Real Estate does not list McHarg as having a license, and the Secretary of State\u2019s website still lists Real Estate Trainers\u2019 business as active.\nReal Estate Trainers Incorporated and all of its affiliated employees are also barred for three years from applying for, taking or any type of participation in any examination for a California real estate license, as well as offering any type of real estate license exam preparation course or pre-license course that uses questions copied or subverted from Department of Real Estate license exams. The settlement also requires that McHarg be removed as an affiliate of Real Estate Trainers Incorporated.\n\u201cThe subversion of real estate license examination content is something [the Department of Real Estate] takes very seriously,\u201d Jeff Oboyski, head of the department\u2019s licensing division, which includes the education and research and examination administration sections, said. \u201cEnsuring that those who attempt to compromise the integrity of our real estate license exams are held accountable for their actions underscores [the Department of Real Estate\u2019s] commitment to consumer protection.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A proposed 5 percent tax on billionaires in California is propelling another wave of wealth to South Florida.\nLook no further than Google co-founder Larry Page, one of the three wealthiest men in the world, who recently spent a\ncombined $173 million\nto buy two waterfront homes in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove.\nPage\u2019s purchases aren\u2019t shocking. In addition to the proposed California tax, ultra high-net worth buyers have for decades been attracted to Florida for its lack of state income tax, conservative politics and pleasant weather. The region is already home to billionaires, who include Amazon founder\nJeff Bezos\n, PayPal co-founder\nPeter Thiel\nand hedge funder\nKen Griffin\n. To keep their Florida residency, they only need to spend six months and a day in the Sunshine State.\nAnd more are considering moves to South Florida, brokers and other industry insiders say.\nFellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was also shopping for a Miami abode, made an offer to buy a waterfront house in Miami Beach for about $50 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nBrin is buying LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke\u2019s Allison Island home.\nInterest picked up in early December, around Art Basel, according to brokers. That\u2019s when Brin arrived in Miami via his $450 million megayacht Dragonfly, which was docked in Biscayne Bay.\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing property almost every single day,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Devin Kay.\nLuxe Living Realty broker Dora Puig said the spike in interest from Californians is \u201cfoundationally strong.\u201d That includes prospective buyers who made their fortune in cryptocurrency, she said.\nThe billionaires, primarily from California but also other parts of the country, are looking from Miami to Palm Beach, where a number of large deals have closed recently as well: In December, fintech billionaire Ronald Clarke, chairman and CEO of Atlanta-based Corpay, purchased a 2.5-acre waterfront compound in North Palm Beach from William Wrigley Jr.\nfor $97.5 million\n. Another $72 million trade closed at the start of the year.\nDanny Hertzberg, of the top-ranked Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, said he\u2019s the busiest he\u2019s been since the pandemic boom of 2021. Hertzberg is part of the team that represented the seller of the $101.5 million estate Page purchased. He declined to comment on the deal.\nHertzberg flew out to California after the wealth tax idea was first floated. The ballot measure would tax California residents worth more than $1 billion the equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. It still has to secure enough signatures to make it onto the November ballot, but if it passes, it would apply retroactively to anyone who lived in California as of Jan. 1, 2026.\n\u201cOur team has been quite busy. Everyone thought it was going to be a New York-Mamdani story, but it\u2019s been a California story,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cexodus\u201d South Florida brokers predicted when Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York in the fall. That\u2019s fallen short.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just L.A., San Francisco. It\u2019s every pocket of California that has high net-worth individuals,\u201d Hertzberg said. South Florida, Texas and Nevada will benefit most if the tax becomes a reality, he added.\nThe buyers are interested in properties at the very top of the market. Coconut Grove has benefitted from the boom already \u2014 in addition to Page\u2019s buys, a mystery buyer spent over $100 million in the same Miami neighborhood, on another waterfront property that\nbillionaire Jorge Mas sold in December.\nKay of Elliman said he\u2019s starting to see a bump in activity spill over into big-ticket contracts for ultra-luxury condos at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club. The luxury condo market has performed less consistently than the waterfront single-family homes, but the Surfside development and its sister projects have attracted a Who\u2019s Who of buyers for years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that across all of our business,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "An Alabama-based insurance brokerage is betting on North Dallas office space, rolling four local offices into a single hub at a prominent building near Central Expressway.\nCRC Group signed a 49,000-square-foot lease at Lakeside Square, the 18-story office building at 12377 Merit Drive. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal brings occupancy at the 409,544-square-foot building to about 85 percent and adds more than 200 employees to the property by March 2026, with some staff already in place.\nThe move consolidates CRC\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth presence into one site. CRC Insurance Services, the operating arm of the group, is an independent brokerage focused on specialty insurance underwriting across the U.S. and Canada. The firm was founded in 1982 in Birmingham, Alabama, and was previously known as TIH Insurance Holdings.\nLakeside Square sits at the crossroads of U.S. 75 and I-635, near\nMedical City Dallas\n, a Costco and a growing cluster of apartments \u2014 a site that\u2019s long appealed to back office and financial services users. Built in 1985, the blue-glass building has its own Dallas lore: It originally served as headquarters for Ross Perot\u2019s Perot Systems and even included a helipad. Perot later decamped to Plano, where his former Electronic Data Systems campus is now being redeveloped as\nAT&amp;T\u2019s global headquarters\n.\nNew York-based\nAcram Group\nhas owned Lakeside Square since late 2018 and has poured more than $10 million into upgrades, including revamped landscaping, a renovated lobby, a fitness center and a tenant lounge. The building also features a boutique cafe and coffee bar, amenities landlords are increasingly leaning on to lure tenants back to the office.\nCRC joins a roster that includes Aethon Energy Management, Audacy and personal injury firm Sweet James. Audacy and Sweet James were among several tenants that signed deals at the building in late 2024, helping reposition the offices.\nJLL\u2019s Gini Rounsaville and Trevor Franke represented Acram in the CRC lease, while Lincoln Property Co.\u2019s Kyle Stanich and JLL\u2019s Conor McCarthy and Taylor Dickerson handled the lease for CRC. Rounsaville said the move reflects sustained demand for high-quality office space in North Dallas.\nThat demand is showing up in the data. A recent JLL report found the\nNorth Dallas\nsubmarket has logged roughly 2.9 million square feet of financial services leasing since 2020, outpacing Uptown and Las Colinas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas luxury is settling into a new normal after booming during the pandemic.\nSales volume, median price, inventory and days on market all describe a luxury market that\u2019s growing, just not as rapidly as it was a few years ago, according to data released by Texas Realtors on transactions that took place between November 2024 to October 2025. The five-year trajectory of the Texas luxury market points to a return to pre-pandemic levels as volume swells at a more consistent rate.\nThe number of home sales over $1 million hit the highest level on record in Texas last year. More than 14,400 homes over $1 million sold in 2025, dethroning the period from November 2021 to October 2022, when almost 14,000 homes above $1 million sold.\nThe state has reached a new high water mark for luxury sales almost every year since 2015. The steadiness of the state\u2019s growth was interrupted in 2021 and 2022, when Texas saw a whopping 90 percent increase in home sales above $1 million. That growth slowed rapidly in 2023 when the luxury market abruptly posted a 16 percent decline in million-dollar home sales from the year before \u2014 the only statewide decline in sales in the last decade.\nThe growth rate of million-dollar home sales in 2025 resembles pre-pandemic conditions. In 2018, million-dollar home sales grew by 11.5 percent. Last year, they grew by 12 percent.\nThe market showed other signs of slowing, as months supply and days on market increased in 2025. Both metrics have been on the rise since 2021.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, inventory rose slightly from 8.1 to 8.3 months supply. The average luxury home also spent 72 days on the market last year, four days slower than 2024.\nThe third-most expensive residential sale in Dallas\nthis year, a 15,7000-square-foot six-eight at\n1 Dorset Place\n, sold in 72 days.\nWhile the market is slowing, it\u2019s not stalling. Before 2021, when inventory plunged below 4 months supply and the average million-dollar home sold in just 55 days, Texas luxury homes generally took at least 80 days to sell, and months supply reached double-digit levels.\nThe growth in inventory from 2024 to 2025 is the flattest change between years since the last decade, indicating a settling ratio of buyers to sellers.\nThe average price per square foot of Texas homes above $1 million rose five dollars to $423 last year. Meanwhile, the average price per square foot of all Texas homes decreased from $190 to $188.\n",

        "content": "Buyers looking for new condos in 2025 faced a steep climb.\nNew development contract signings were down 11 percent compared to 2024, according to\nMarketproof data\ncovering deals closed in 2025.\nThe culprit for the lackluster contract numbers was not a lack of demand, according to Marketproof CEO Kael Goodman, but a dearth of desirable buildings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a function of the product,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the product is good, people will buy it. If the product is less desirable, even in this type of market, it just sits there.\nThat phenomenon was seen in the strong sales figures a number of newer buildings posted, said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Marketing Development. On the other hand, when buyers can\u2019t find a suitable condo, they haven\u2019t been taking the next best thing.\n\u201cBuyers are waiting a little bit to have either product in locations that they\u2019re more interested in, or sizes or price points,\u201d he said.\nBoth Manhattan and Brooklyn felt the inventory squeeze.\nIn Manhattan, contract signings fell 12 percent annually to just over 1,400, according to BHSDM. Despite the dip in contracts, total inventory in the borough fell roughly 13 percent to just under 3,600.\nThe deal volume in the borough fell by 3 percent to $6.5 billion, driven by what BHSDM estimates is nearly $1 billion in sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury downtown offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development. In December, the building inked a\n$129 million deal\nfor multiple units, which would be a downtown record if it closes at that price.\nThe building has yet to report sales numbers, but even adding in its estimated contracts makes a dull 2025 look only so much rosier.\nIn Brooklyn, there were just over 1,000 new development contracts signed, 6 percent down from 2024, according to BHSDM. At the same time, the supply of new condos in the borough fell 19 percent yearly to just above 1,300.\nUnlike Manhattan, where pricing has been nearly flat over the last 10 years, Brooklyn\u2019s price per square foot rose 44 percent in that time to $1,385, driven by an outsize number of sales occurring at pricey waterfront developments like Two Trees\u2019 condominium at\nOne Domino Square\nand Naftali Group\u2019s residential offering at\nOne Williamsburg Wharf\n.\nA surprise top performer\nBuyers looking for something new found it, in a way, at\n125 Greenwich Street\n, the top-selling building in the city in 2025, according to Marketproof.\nKnown as The Greenwich, the 272-unit condominium re-launched sales in 2024 following a turnover in the development team and a building rebrand in 2023.\nA Douglas Elliman Development Marketing Team led by Stacey Spielman put 64 units into contract in 2025, according to Marketproof. The sales efforts likely benefitted from steep price drops, with newly listed units asking on average 25 percent less than they were before 2023.\nBut the building also hit some noteworthy milestones, selling its first handful of units asking at least $4 million, including a 79th-floor asking $5 million, or roughly $3,000 per square foot, according to Marketproof.\nGlacier Equities and InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 project at\n720 West End Avenue\nnetted 59 contracts, right behind The Greenwich.\nBoth buildings\u2019 success this year proved \u201cthat once you find your price point things do move quickly,\u201d according to Kliegerman.\nIn Brooklyn, One Domino Square scored 49 contracts for over $130 million, according to the report from BHSDM.\nNo reprieve in sight\nDespite the lackluster numbers in 2025, there\u2019s no sign that 2026 \u2014 or even 2027 \u2014 will be any better for buyers.\nIn Manhattan, BHSDM projects an average of just under 1,300 units to come online in each of the next two years, less than the total contracts signed this past year.\nIn Brooklyn, the situation is even more stark. In the next two years, BHSDM projects an average of roughly 580 units to be delivered, despite the borough averaging over 1,000 contracts per year.\nIf deal numbers fall short again in 2026 though, don\u2019t blame buyers, said Kliegerman.\n\u201cWe believe very, very firmly that there\u2019s a lot of demand for product, but that the lack of new product is actually creating less transactions, not that buyers aren\u2019t interested in purchasing,\u201d he said.\n",

Garodnick guided several of Adams\u2019 biggest housing policies, including passage of the City of Yes and the Midtown South rezoning.\nPrior to his time with the planning department, Garodnick was a Manhattan City Councilmember for 12 years. He helped negotiate Blackstone and Ivanhoe Cambridge\u2019s $5.3 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village in 2015, which required the owners to keep 5,000 of the complex\u2019s apartments affordable for at least 20 years.\nHe also shepherded the\nrezoning of Midtown East\nthrough the city\u2019s arduous land use review process.\nWho takes Garodnick\u2019s post with the DCP and CPC will be closely watched by those in the real estate industry. The position is instrumental for development plans in the city, particularly in the realm of affordable housing.\nMamdani has promised to construct 200,000 affordable units in the next decade.\nDina Levy, the senior vice president of single family and community development with the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal,\nrecently\nlanded the nomination as commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Meritage Homes is pursuing a rezoning of a 30-acre site it has under contract in Wellington, with preliminary plans for a 206-townhome complex.\nThe Scottsdale, Arizona-based homebuilder proposes the project for the six-lot site at 16300, 16350 and 16426 Velazquez Road, and at 16275, 16301 and 16421 Rembrandt Road, near\nLion Country Safari\n, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. Meritage, led by Phillippe Lord, filed the rezoning and master plan application in November.\nEach townhome lot would range from 1,800 square feet to 2,100 square feet.\nThe Wellington Planning and Zoning Board and Village Council are to each vote on the project. The proposal hasn\u2019t been scheduled for a meeting yet.\nMeritage\u2019s filing comes as more rural areas of Palm Beach County are experiencing redevelopment, primarily with housing complexes. The area is one of the few sections of South Florida with enough land supply for more sprawled communities.\nWestlake, the county\u2019s youngest municipality that incorporated in 2016, is in a western part of the county. Master developer Minto Communities has approvals for\nthousands of homes\n, commercial space, a school and police and fire stations. Minto bought the\n4,000-acre\nsite for Westlake in 2013.\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, the 4,800-acre master-planned Avenir is taking shape on the northwest corner of Northlake and Coconut boulevards. It has approvals for 3,900 residential units, mostly single-family homes, plus a 300-key hotel, 200,000 square feet for medical offices, 400,000 square feet for retail and a 2,400-acre nature preserve. Coral Gables-based Landstar is the master developer,\nselling off\npieces of the Avenir assemblage to homebuilders in recent years.\nAnother master-planned Palm Beach County community is the 1,200-acre\nArden\n, near Wellington. It is approved for 2,300 homes and is billed as an \u201cagrihood\u201d complex due to a 5-acre farm that allows residents to grow and harvest produce.\nLennar has invested over\n$226 million\nfor homesites in Arden.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "Wilmette was busier than usual in 2025, and not just by North Shore standards.\nHome sales in the lakefront suburb jumped more than 20 percent last year, according to an analysis of preliminary year-end sales records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s, putting Wilmette among a small group of Chicago-area communities that defied an otherwise flat housing market. Agents on the ground told the outlet that the surge was palpable, even compared to nearby high-end enclaves.\nLisa Finks for instance, a Compass agent who works across several North Shore towns, told the publication that sales volume in Wilmette seemed much busier than in other areas.\nWilmette\nwas among nine suburbs and city neighborhoods where home sales rose sharply in 2025, Crain\u2019s reported, bucking a metro-area market that barely moved. Across the nine-county region, sales ended the year up just 0.2 percent from 2024 \u2014 essentially flat \u2014 which itself was the slowest year for Chicago-area home sales since 2011. Final numbers could shift slightly once final year-end Illinois Realtors data is released, but the broader picture remains one of stagnation.\nAlongside Wilmette, several Chicago neighborhoods posted notable gains, including Little Village, where sales climbed 24 percent, Avondale at 19 percent, and\nHumboldt Park\nand South Shore at roughly 13 percent, each. Suburban standouts included Plainfield, Flossmoor, Schaumburg and Glen Ellyn, all up by double digits.\nA common thread across many of these pockets is relative affordability, especially as buyers grapple with elevated interest rates and years of price appreciation. In\nSouth Shore\n, for example, the median sale price in November was $185,000, according to Redfin, compared with $230,000 in Hyde Park and $276,000 in\nKenwood\n.\n\u201cSouth Shore is still one of the few areas where prices make sense in today\u2019s interest rate environment,\u201d said Greg Faulkner of the Howell-Faulkner Group at Re/Max Premier.\nEven Wilmette benefits from a perception of value, at least within its peer group. The suburb is seen as more attainable than other New Trier Township communities, Finks said, with median home prices just under $1.3 million, compared with about $1.7 million in Glencoe and more than $2 million in Winnetka.\nBeyond price, Wilmette\u2019s strong schools, walkable village center and transit access have regained importance, as remote work fades and daily commutes matter again, Fink told the publication.\nThe broader market, meanwhile, remains constrained by historically tight inventory. Many owners are staying put, locked into low-rate mortgages.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Hollingsworth and Alemayehu Mergia to reverse the sale of the 83-foot-long, 7-foot-wide unpaved dirt alley, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nIt all started last spring when the couple received a letter from the San Francisco treasurer\u2019s office that advertised an auction on pieces of land where owners had failed to pay their property taxes. The parcels for sale were \u201crendered unusable by their size, location, or other conditions\u201d with bidding starting at $1.\nHollingsworth and Mergia believed they were competing for a neighboring home at 1926 Kirkham Street, submitted a bid for $25,000 as well as an additional $8,000\ntransfer tax\n, taking the money out of their retirement funds to put in the offer. After celebrating their successful purchase at the sealed-bid auction, they realized that they had actually bought the alley next to their home officially referred to on Google Maps as \u201cDirt Alley,\u201d rather than the building next door.\nLast month, Hollingsworth reached out to Wong\u2019s office, asking the newly appointed Sunset supervisor to \u201crepresent me on a recent \u2018street fight\u2019 in San Francisco which needs immediate resolution with the [San Francisco] Board of Supervisors.\u201d\nThough Hollingsworth and Mergia don\u2019t have to have Wong by their side to bring their case before the board and ask it to overturn the sale, they believe having Wong\u2019s support \u2014 and vote \u2014 will bolster their case.\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco tax collector, which organized the sale, said the office doesn\u2019t have a position on undoing the transaction, which has only happened once before in 2017 when homeowners in\nPresidio Terrace\nsuccessfully reversed the $90,000 sale of a street in their gated neighborhood to a\nSan Jose\ncouple.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this done,\u201d Hollingsworth told the Standard. \u201cIt would be an opportunity for [Wong] to prove that he can represent a constituent in the right way, see through this bullshit and fix it.\u201d\nWong\u2019s office will likely meet with the couple in person to explain the process in the coming weeks. A majority of supervisors would have to vote to overturn the sale.\n\u201cSupervisor Wong is committed to serving and representing the residents of District 4,\u201d his office said in a statement, per the Standard. \u201cIf the constituent ultimately wishes to pursue a request to rescind the sale, the supervisor\u2019s office stands ready to assist them through the appropriate process with the Board of Supervisors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Charles Cohen can\u2019t do right by his creditor, Fortress Investment Group.\nThis week, Cohen sold the office building at 3 East 54th Street in the Plaza District to Vornado Realty Trust for $141 million, Bisnow\nreported\n. Steven Roth\u2019s firm applied the $107 million debt it bought against the property over the last two years towards the purchase of the building, which it plans to raze.\nThe sale would seem to be good news for Cohen, who is scrambling to raise cash after a New York judge ordered him to\nrepay $187 million\npersonally guaranteed to Fortress.\nBut the final sale price proved to be a pittance compared to what once was. In court documents this summer, Cohen Brothers Realty claimed it agreed to sell the property to an unnamed buyer\nfor $188 million\n. The funds were expected to arrive by international wire transfer.\nThey never did, though, leaving Cohen with few options to sell the 300,000-square-foot building, in which it owned a 63 percent stake. In stepped Vornado, which moved quickly to finalize the transaction. It\u2019s expected to generate $30 million to pay down the judgment, according to the firm representing Cohen.\nIn a letter to a judge, attorneys for Fortress said the deal was a \u201cvery far cry from satisfying the judgment debt,\u201d claiming the creditor was blindsided by the deal. The company wants to subpoena Cohen for financial records and have a pair of properties put into receivership.\nFortress declined to comment to the publication, while Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.\nCohen also recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado for $218 million. That sale was expected to generate $70 million towards paying the debt to Fortress, but only $30 million has been provided to the creditor from that deal so far, according to court filings.\nFortress has been trying to recoup more than $500 million it says Cohen defaulted on. The private equity giant has accused him of shifting assets \u2014 including his Connecticut home and 220-foot yacht \u2014 into his wife\u2019s name, allegations Cohen denies.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The walls are closing in on a once prominent condo deconversion team.\nStrategic Properties of North America, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, is facing foreclosure on its Skokie office building. The firm is based in Skokie and Lakewood, New Jersey.\nAttorneys for Byline Bank this week filed a foreclosure complaint against SPNA for a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAbout the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nKupperwasser, Klor and attorneys for Byline did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe filing is the latest sign that SPNA is facing mounting financial trouble. The condo deconversion specialists had two proposed purchases fall through in recent years due to lack of financing.\nThe company bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit Ontario Place in Chicago\u2019s River North, but after three years of negotiations,\nfailed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units\n. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nIn 2024, SPNA fumbled a second condo deconversion at\na condo building at 200 North Dearborn\nin Chicago. The condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the remaining units for $90 million, after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nSPNA also recently sold an apartment building at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group\nbought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month.\nThe seller last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records. It\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property to Laramar last month.\nPrior to the sale, the building had faced its share of challenges. Loan records indicate Wave Lakeview struggled to generate income for SPNA while the company owned and operated it.\u00a0 When SPNA refinanced the property with MF1 in 2019, the lender bundled the $62 million debt into a collateralized loan obligation package, public records show. Doing so made some of the loan\u2019s details public.\nThe loan was watchlisted by its servicer in May 2021 for having a debt-to-service coverage ratio under 1, meaning the building\u2019s income was not covering its operating costs, according to commercial debt tracker MorningStar Credit. It was later removed from the watchlist in August 2021 when SPNA secured an extension on the loan. More recent details of the loan are harder to determine because MF1 appears to have taken the debt off the public market at some point in 2022.\nIn October, the company\nlisted the K Square Apartments\nin Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "Texas put its signature on one of its biggest economic development wins yet under a new incentive regime, officially clearing the way for Eli Lilly\u2019s $6.5 billion manufacturing plant in northeast Houston.\nThe final Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act tax agreement that lured the pharmaceutical giant to Houston was posted to the state comptroller\u2019s website this week, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal caps a fast-moving courtship that began less than a year ago, when Eli Lilly first applied for the\nincentive program\nand\npublicly disclosed\nits interest in the region.\nThe global drugmaker plans to build the massive facility on 236 acres within McCord Development\u2019s Generation Park, a 4,300-acre master-planned industrial park off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston. The plant will manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, including orforglipron, Lilly\u2019s closely watched\noral GLP-1 drug\naimed at treating obesity.\nThe agreement offers a clearer look at the economics behind the splashy announcement.\nLilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category. The company said the plant will ultimately create more than 600 high-paying jobs, with an initial requirement of 75 jobs and $200 million in investment by the first year of the incentive period. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs for the duration of its buildout.\nMcCord Development will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nTo secure the deal, Sheldon Independent School District agreed to exempt the property from school taxes through 2030, then cap the taxable value at 50 percent for another decade. The district\u2019s board signed off in November, and Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office added its signature on Jan. 5, finalizing the agreement after a joint announcement with Lilly last fall.\nThe timing of construction remains murky. While the incentive paperwork lists a Sept. 1, 2025 construction start date, no visible signs of work existed following Abbott\u2019s Sept. 23 announcement. Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.\nThe project is part of Eli Lilly\u2019s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing.\nCEO David Ricks\nhas pointed to permanently lowered federal corporate tax rates as a tailwind for \u201cintellectual property-driven\u201d businesses, though he has downplayed the role of state incentives alone. Houston beat out a \u201cvery competitive\u201d runner-up, he said, thanks to workforce quality, available space and a collaborative local government culture.\nThose factors are baked into Generation Park\u2019s pitch. The development is home to San Jacinto College\u2019s Center for Biotechnology, creating a direct training pipeline for pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs, with Sheldon ISD already feeding students into the program.\nWhile Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than\n700 life science\ncompanies making Houston home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The fallout from\nLuxUrban Hotels\u2019 spectacular unraveling\nis no longer confined to courtrooms, creditors and locked hotel doors. For a former executive, it\u2019s turning personal.\nBrian Ferdinand, the founder and former chief executive of the short-lived hotel operator, filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy last month, seeking a clean break from nearly $100 million in liabilities tied largely to the company\u2019s failed New York City hotel leases. Ferdinand reported less than $4.5 million in assets against more than $98 million in debt, according to the filing, first reported by\nBisnow\n.\nAt the core of the wreckage are the personal guarantees Ferdinand signed as LuxUrban raced to scale up its master-lease model across Manhattan. Those guarantees left him directly on the hook for tens of millions of dollars after the company stopped paying rent and landlords moved to enforce their claims.\nFerdinand owes $28 million to MAve Hotel Investors, which owns Hotel 27 on Madison Avenue, $6.4 million to the owner of The Herald near Herald Square and $14.2 million tied to the Tuscany Hotel, court records show.\nThe list of creditors reads like a cross-section of LuxUrban\u2019s most troubled deals. Ferdinand also disclosed a $19 million obligation to Wyndham Hotel Group stemming from an abandoned partnership, a $2.7 million judgment related to a defaulted lease at 123 Washington Street and nearly $4 million owed to merchant cash advance lenders.\nHe reported 18 lawsuits filed against him in the year before the bankruptcy, most connected to breached loan or lease guarantees, along with $148,000 in unpaid federal taxes from 2023.\nFinancially, the filing portrays a dramatic reversal. Ferdinand says he is unemployed, with no income, less than $170 in cash across three bank accounts and a repossessed Porsche Cayenne. He is receiving a $30,000 monthly allowance from his father. His biggest remaining asset is a Sunny Isles Beach condo valued at $4.4 million, though it is encumbered by $5.7 million in mortgages.\nFerdinand launched CorpHousing Group in 2017, initially leasing apartments for short-term stays before pivoting during the pandemic to master leasing hotels. That strategy powered a $13 million initial public offering in 2022 and a rebrand to LuxUrban Hotels, pitching the company as a fast-growing disruptor in hospitality.\nThe ambition outpaced the balance sheet. After a short seller report and mounting lawsuits, LuxUrban filed for Chapter 11 in September, only to\ncollapse into Chapter 7 liquidation\nweeks later after abandoning hotels, workers and\nbooked guests\n.\nThough Ferdinand had stepped away from day-to-day leadership, the company\u2019s court-appointed trustee is seeking to pull him back into the liquidation, arguing that only he can produce key financial records.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Pompano Beach apartment building traded for $41 million, marking a slight discount from its price four years ago, while a Boca Raton rental complex sold for $30 million.\nGreenwood Village, Colorado-based Griffis Residential bought the eight-story, 144-unit building at 275 North Federal Highway in Pompano Beach from Montreal-based Frankforter Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $29.5 million from Chicago-based PPM America for the purchase.\nAlso, Matthew Paul\u2019s MAP Communities bought the 106-unit Boca Villa Apartments complex at 100 West Hidden Valley Boulevard in Boca Raton from Edwidge Realty and Marina &amp; Briana limited partnerships. MAP took over a $32.5 million loan on the complex, with a $28.5 million balance, provided by Greenwich, Connecticut-based lender Ellington Financial.\nThe deals come at a dubious time for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market. While\nleaseups\nhave taken a hit due to hefty completions in recent years and a slower influx of out-of-staters, landlords also have felt the sting from elevated interest rates and increases in other costs such as insurance, leading some to sell at a discount.\nThe Pompano Beach building was completed in 2019 on a 0.8-acre site, property records show.\u00a0 Frankforter, led by Yaakov Frankforter, paid\n$42.9 million\nfor the building in 2021, meaning the recent sale marked a 4.3 percent discount from the 2021 price.\nThe building, called Griffis Pompano Beach, consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $2,175 to more than $2,895, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThe Boca Raton complex sits on 7.2 acres. It was completed in two phases. The first five two-story buildings with 53 units, combined, were finished in 1988. In 2021, another 53 units were completed in one three-story building and one five-story building.\nBoca Villa Apartments consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, Vizzda records show. Rents aren\u2019t listed.\nGriffis, led by Ian Griffis and David Birnbaum, is a multifamily owner and manager with a portfolio of 30 communities spanning 9,000 units across 13 national markets, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment.\nIn June, Griffis paid\n$87 million\nfor the 15-story, 223-unit apartment building at 345 Banyan Boulevard in downtown West Palm Beach.\nMAP Communities was founded in March by Paul, who previously was vice president for Florida at single-family rental homes developer Christopher Todd Communities, according to his LinkedIn. MAP has focused its investment in South Florida, amassing a portfolio of about six properties since it was founded.\nIn other recent South Florida multifamily deals, Ortsac Capital Group bought the 206-unit Ventura Pointe complex at 7850 Pasadena Boulevard in Pembroke Pines for\n$52.5 million\nlast month. It marked a 5.6 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2019 price.\nAlso last month, Greystar and Artemis Real Estate Partners bought the 220-unit age-restricted Everleigh Palm Beach Gardens complex at 3660 RCA Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$69.4 million\n.\n",

However, he is under contract to sell the site to Miami-based Key International, led by brothers\nInigo and Diego Ardid\n, according to a memorandum filed in public deeds.\nThe purchase and sale agreement is being used as collateral for the Banco Santander mortgage, records show. It\u2019s unclear if the $65 million loan is for construction of the project.

        "content": "The hangover from the craft beer boom has turned into a legal headache for Steve Soble, owner of District Brew Yards.\nWaterman Bank filed a foreclosure suit against the ownership entity of the\nrecently shuttered beer hall\u2019s Wheeling outpost\n, alleging the borrower owes more than $2.3 million in unpaid principal, interest and fees. The complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court late last month, marks the latest distress signal in a local brewing scene that has seen a wave of closures from industry titans and neighborhood favorites alike.\nThe lawsuit targets 700 N Milwaukee LLC and its guarantors, Dale \u201cSteve\u201d Soble and wife Kendall Soble. Steve Soble, a 36-year veteran of the Chicago brewery and dining scene who also founded Burnt City Brewing, opened the Wheeling brewery in 2022 as a suburban expansion of his popular West Town concept. It allows District Brew Yards patrons to pour their own beers from a wall of taps.\nBut the taps ran dry quickly. According to Waterman\u2019s complaint, the borrower stopped making payments on the $2.3 million Wheeling loan in April 2024. While the two sides apparently attempted to salvage the deal through multiple forbearance agreements, the bank alleges the borrower defaulted again In August 2025, court records show.\nAs of last month, Waterman Bank claims the total payoff amount has swelled to more than $2.3 million, with interest accruing daily.\nThe foreclosure filing comes just months after Soble publicly announced a \u201cwind down\u201d of District Brew Yards\u2019 operations. In September, reports indicated the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue was being marketed for sale with an asking price of roughly $3.6 million. At the time, Soble cited a desire to retire and a difficult market as reasons for the exit.\nThe legal action suggests a buyer hasn\u2019t materialized at a price sufficient to clear the debt before the bank\u2019s patience ran out, but it remains on the market with CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero. It is now asking $2.7 million, according to an online\nlisting\n. The West Town property in Chicago is still operating, but the property is also listed for sale asking $4.5 million.\nWaterman\u2019s foreclosure is emblematic of a broader crisis facing the middle market of the hospitality industry \u2014 full-service venues sandwiched between high-end dining and quick-serve chains.\n\u201cThere has been a real pullback in mid-level dining experiences that is not just craft beer-focused,\u201d Steve Soble told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cA lot of places on the high end are doing really well. The middle is being hollowed out.\u201d\nThe craft beer sector, once a darling of retail real estate, has been battered by a perfect storm of headwinds. Inflation has squeezed margins, but a cultural shift is proving even more damaging: Americans are simply drinking less.\nIndustry analysts have also pointed to the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, which can curb cravings for both food and alcohol, as a growing threat to revenue. Combined with the \u201cDry January\u201d movement extending year-round for many younger consumers, volume-dependent businesses like large beer halls are finding it harder to cover the rent.\nDistrict Brew Yards is far from alone in its struggles. Miskatonic Brewing\nshuttered its suburban Chicago location in Darien\nthis month, blaming the downturn on \u201cpeople drinking less\u201d and the financial strain of a failed expansion. That closure followed the\nhigh-profile exit of Lagunitas\n, which closed its large Chicago production facility and taproom in 2024 after a decade of operation.\nHowever, a\n$12 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfor the Great Central Brewing property on Chicago\u2019s Near West Side filed by Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital in 2023 was resolved without stripping the property from the borrowers. \u201cThe sponsor was resourceful and was able to recapitalize the property,\u201d T2\u2019s CEO Jeff Brown said Friday.\nDavid Avram, one of the original owners and borrowers for the Great Central property, took on several million dollars of additional debt tied to the brewery building over the past year in an attempt to straighten out the company\u2019s financial affairs, and T2\u2019s foreclosure was dismissed in early 2025, court records show.\nMeanwhile, Waterman Bank has requested a judgment of foreclosure and sale for the Wheeling District Brew Yards, as well as the right to appoint a receiver to take control of the property. An attorney for Waterman didn\u2019t return a request for comment. The lawsuit\u2019s next court date is scheduled for a June 29 case management hearing, online records show.\n",

        "content": "The long-shuttered Empire Theater in West Portal is facing the wrecking ball and a rebirth as a nine-story residential building.\nThe arts venue at 85 West Portal Avenue is\nslated for demolition\n, and local builder DM Development is plotting to build 64 residential units across nine floors at the site, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nDM is acting as developer for a group led by Jesse Appleton, whose family has owned the theater for more than 100 years. Appleton and a partner bought it in 2021 from other family members following longtime operator Cinemark\u2019s abandoning its lease and closing the theater, ripping out seats, screens and projectors in the process.\n\u201cThe [former operator] mothballed it, stripped out all the equipment and just left it,\u201d Appleton told the Chronicle. While his group explored bringing the facility back as a theater, the building\u2019s poor condition and the opening of a multiplex nearby meant theater operators weren\u2019t interested in moving in. As a result, the team opted to build housing instead, planning for 62 two- and three-bedroom rental apartments at the site.\n\u201cWe want something that is going to endure. We want to stay in this long term. That is our goal,\u201d Appleton said.\nTo bring the project to life, developers will take advantage of two state laws that allow the structure to be taller and denser than currently allowed by zoning regulations.\nSenate Bill 330\ndoubles the permitted density on the site, and Assembly Bill 2011 requires a streamlined 90-day approval. Of the 64 units, 10 will be below market rate, with five affordable to households earning 50 percent of the area median income, and five units\u00a0 meant for households making 120 percent of the area median income. Groundbreaking is expected next year.\nHistoric theaters in San Francisco have been trading hands or floated for renovations or redevelopment over the past year.\nLast April, the San Francisco Planning Commission\napproved a zoning change\nfor the Alexandria Theater to allow for the construction of 75 housing units. In June, the fate of the\nClay Theatre\nwas revealed as its new ownership plots upgrades for 4K digital projection, 35mm film capabilities, new acoustics and accessibility improvements. And last month, the San Francisco Giants\npurchased the Curran Theatre\nfrom Shorenstein family scion Carole Shorenstein Hays.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller is a ranch company owned by the late Eugene Kincaid III, an accomplished amateur historian and heir of a historic ranching family.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but seller\u2019s agent Robert Dullnig with Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had listed the property for $16.5 million. Seger\u2019s company, BC Frio 5000, secured a $13.5 million loan from Security State Bank and Trust for the purchase.\nAside from some irrigation wells and a 1,000-square-foot cabin, the land remains mostly unimproved, differing little from the \u201c\nOne League and one Labor\n\u201d of land that the Republic of Texas granted to Maria Francisca Sosa in 1838, according to the General Land Office.\nDullnig billed the raw land as a\ndevelopment opportunity\n, ready for \u201cimprovements of your choice,\u201d the listing states. The property includes several buildable homesites, according to Dullnig.\nThe sellers have leased the property as a\nhunting destination\nfor years. The perimeter of the land includes over seven miles of high fence, and five irrigation wells supply water to troughs and tanks, supplementing the Leona River.\nThe land has just over two miles of waterfront on the Leona. It\u2019s also veined by seasonal creeks that add over seven miles of waterfront during high-water periods.\nEugene Kincaid Jr. bought the land in 1948 for $121,000, according to public records. He was the grandson of William Davis Kincaid, who founded the Kincaid Ranch near Uvalde, just northeast of the Leona River ranch.\nEugene Kincaid III counted among his ancestors a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto, which won the independence of the Republic of Texas. He collaborated with a professional historian in identifying a historic Spanish explorer campsite on the Kincaid Ranch.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s CityFHEPS voucher program has a $1.2 billion price tag. Now, the state comptroller wants less of that money going to \u201cbad\u201d landlords.\nIn an audit of the program released Friday, the comptroller\u2019s office found that the city approved units with infestations and other serious concerns for participation in the program. And some tenants have used their vouchers to pay landlords on the city\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nAs such, the comptroller recommended that the program establish a \u201clandlord disqualification\u201d list.\nThe audit is the latest public criticism of the rental assistance program, which serves mostly formerly homeless New Yorkers, and is a source of income to private landlords. Disqualifying specific landlords from the program would cut them off from that income stream.\nThe state comptroller\u2019s office reviewed 45 CityFHEPS cases in the five boroughs. Of those, three had open housing code violations classified as \u201cimmediately hazardous,\u201d including infestations.\nThat\u2019s not only not a great situation for tenants, it\u2019s expensive, the report argued. For audited voucher recipients who ultimately had to move, the program had to pay nearly $119,000 in new brokers\u2019 fees and landlord incentives.\nIn one case, the city\u2019s Department of Social Services approved a tenant to move into a unit with 20 open violations, including mouse and cockroach infestations. DSS paid more than $7,000 to the broker and the landlord to secure the apartment before the tenant moved in. Another CityFHEPS tenant had already been approved to move out of that unit because of similar concerns.\n\u201cLandlords continue to participate in CityFHEPS without having to rectify poor living situations,\u201d the report said.\nFurther review by the comptroller\u2019s office found DSS also approved at least 57 CityFHEPS households to use their vouchers on units owned by landlords on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nDSS said it would establish a landlord \u201cescalation\u201d list, \u201cto enable more intensive reviews of specific landlords.\u201d DSS disputed several of the report\u2019s conclusions, saying it contained several inaccuracies and doesn\u2019t highlight the successes of the program.\nIn a statement to\nGothamist\n, DSS accountability chief Bedros Boodanian blamed the habitability issues on New York\u2019s low vacancy rate.\n\u201cTenants, especially low-income households with vouchers like CityFHEPS, have very few available units from which to choose,\u201d Boodanian wrote. \u201cRestricting voucher use to only pristine landlords would shrink an already microscopic pool of available units, further delaying housing for people who need it most.\u201d\nTo the comptroller\u2019s office, DSS said The \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list lacks legal enforceability.\nThe audit identified other concerns with CityFHEPS oversight. For example, in thirty out of 75 statewide cases, there was no record of income verification. The comptroller\u2019s office recommended that DSS follow its income verification policies.\n",

Dropbox has been\nretreating from the space\nlittle by little in recent years.\nIf the deal is completed, it will bring\nOpenAI\n\u2019s presence in Mission Bay to about 1 million square feet.

The company is currently linked to another deal at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard, though there is \u201cno confirmation of either deal closing,\u201d a source familiar with the matter told the Chronicle. It is not clear whether the firm plans to occupy both 1800 Owens and 455 Mission Bay or is deciding between the two locations.\nThe 1800 Owens complex totals approximately 750,000 square feet and is located about half a mile from OpenAI\u2019s existing offices in Mission Bay. Dropbox at one point occupied the entire building but began\nparing down its footprint\nduring the pandemic,\nsubleasing out much of the space\n.\nThe creator of ChatGPT has been on a growth spurt in Mission Bay since 2023, beginning that year with a nearly 500,000-square-foot\nsublease from Uber\nacross two buildings on Third Street and continuing the following year with a full-building lease encompassing 315,000 square feet at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. The latter deal marked one of the largest office deals in San Francisco in 2024.\nThough OpenAI\u2019s operations are concentrated in San Francisco, the ChatGPT giant is looking to grow into Silicon Valley.

        "content": "San Antonio is moving closer to securing a key piece of its Project Marvel vision, putting a $30 million price tag on a trio of federally-owned parcels that city leaders see as critical to reshaping downtown around a new Spurs arena and mixed-use district.\nCity officials are seeking approval to acquire three properties in and around Hemisfair, including a federal office building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard and two adjacent parking lots at 610 and 611 Indianola Street, according to documents submitted to San Antonio City Council and first\nreported\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The\nSpurs\nwould front the purchase price under a funding framework the council\napproved\nlast August as part of its broader partnership with the NBA franchise.\nThe office building, controlled by the General Services Administration, was deemed surplus and placed on the GSA\u2019s accelerated disposition list last year. Council is set to vote on the acquisition Jan. 15, following a recommendation from the Planning Commission in December. City officials estimate the federal review process would take 90 to 120 days once an offer is submitted.\nWhile the city would own the properties, the federal government is expected to remain in the office building for up to five years under a leaseback arrangement. Officials say the rental income would cover operating costs during that period. Any future redevelopment of the building would also be constrained by restrictive covenants from the Texas Historical Commission, adding a layer of complexity to long-term plans, according to the publication.\nStill, city staff have framed the acquisition as foundational to Project Marvel\u2019s ambitions. In a memo to the Planning Commission, officials said federal control of the parcels has long acted as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d between Hemisfair and surrounding streets, limiting pedestrian and vehicular access and contributing to underinvestment in nearby Tower Park.\nBringing the land under local control would allow the city to rework entrances, improve wayfinding and better integrate Hemisfair into the surrounding urban fabric, while opening the door to\nuses more consistent\nwith a dense, mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena, according to city documents.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County voters approved $311 million in\npublic funding\nfor Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The city is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization committed to $1 billion toward the district.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Last year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition, and former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 15.\nThe auction commenced despite efforts by tenants and elected officials, most recently Mamdani\u2019s office, to delay the sale. The coalition had asked the judge in the case for more time, originally hoping that the city or a nonprofit might be able to draft a workable bid. After Summit came forward as a stalking horse bidder, the city asked for a 30-day pause to evaluate the sale to Summit and explore potential alternatives.\nHowever, the judge rejected that effort in a Wednesday hearing, clearing the way for Summit\u2019s acquisition.\nAs distress grows in the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock, the auction result shows a potential future for thousands of units across the city. Surging expenses and elevated interest rates have eaten away at revenue, at the same time that a 2019 statewide law has limited owners\u2019 abilities to raise rents. Pinnacle placed its LLCs into Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing $564 million to Flagstar Bank, according to court records.\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to New York and understand how critical the preservation of affordable housing is to the success of our City,\u201d Zohar Levy, chairman of Summit, said in a statement. \u201cWe have reached out to the City and look forward to talking with the new administration and residents about our plans to invest in the portfolio and help make New York affordable for everyone.\u201d\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. But the Mamdani administration expressed concern that Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties and maintaining rent stabilization. The bankrupt LLCs owe the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, which number more than 5,000.\nThe legal rents on the units are low enough that Summit likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nEastdil Secured advised on the auction.",

        "content": "Billionaires are leaving California in droves in the face of a ballot initiative seeking to place a 5 percent tax on their wealth.\nAt least six dozen billionaires\nleft the Golden State\nbefore the new year and more than a dozen others could follow suit, Bloomberg reported, citing financial advisers working for the affluent. If approved by voters this November, any billionaire living in the state as of Jan. 1, 2026 would be eligible for the one-time 5 percent tax on fortunes exceeding $1 billion.\nOn Dec. 31,\nPeter Thiel\nand\nDavid Sacks\nboth publicly announced new office locations in Florida and Texas, respectively, following the relocation of four other billionaires ahead of the new year. Financial adviser David Lesperance told Bloomberg that he helped four billionaires leave the state ahead of the Jan. 1 residency cut-off date;\nIconiq Capital\nfounder Divesh Makan knows a handful of other families that have already departed and expects another 15 to 20 to flee if the tax is approved, Makan told Bloomberg.\nThe billionaire tax initiative still has a ways to go before making it to the\nNovember ballot\n. The effort must gather hundreds of thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, then secure approval from a majority of California voters. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those who have spoken out against the bill.\nTech founders from major companies like Netflix, WhatsApp and Stripe are\nreportedly also looking\nat homes in Florida to escape California, the New York Post reported. Last month, Google co-founder Larry Page\nbought roughly\n$173 million of waterfront real estate in Miami, including one $100 million estate and another one nearby for $72 million, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn the last probably month or so, I\u2019ve had multiple billionaires from California come to see several different listings that I have,\u201d Devin Kay, a Miami-based agent with Douglas Elliman, told the Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s definitely a huge wave of them, it appears they are either\nbuying properties in Miami\nor in the market to buy properties, and will once they find something here shortly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a huge influx from California ever since Covid,\u201d Kay added. \u201cIn the last three or four years, I\u2019ve seen more buyers from California than I ever have in my entire career. But I would say the megabillionaires or the very, very wealthy people from California \u2014 that is definitely more recent as of the last, maybe two or three months.\u201d\nSimply put, these ultra-wealthy buyers are looking to escape the possible ballot measure in California. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious why these guys are doing what they\u2019re doing in Miami,\u201d Kay said.\nBut billionaires aren\u2019t the only ones leaving California, and this trend isn\u2019t new among the average person.\nOf the more than 2.5 million one-way trips using\nU-Haul\nvehicles last year, the difference between number of people leaving and the number of people arriving\nwas higher in California\nthan in any other state, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing data from U-Haul. The Golden state has had the biggest net outflow for six years in a row. Of California U-Haulers, 50.6 percent of the moving company\u2019s one-way customers left, while 49.4 percent arrived.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "On Thursday afternoon, a group of tenants gathered at the corner of West 55th Street and Sixth Avenue.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let our homes be sold to another slumlord!\u201d they said.\nJust a few blocks away, a very different gathering was taking place: an auction for those same homes.\nAt the law offices of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, bids were circulating for more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized apartments. They are the property of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group, which had put them into bankruptcy.\nWe\u2019ve heard the auction started Thursday morning and went into the night. But the winner was confirmed at 4 p.m. on Friday: Summit Properties, run by chairman Zohar Levy, is\nslated to be the new owner\nof the units.\nIt\u2019s a deal that\u2019s been much scrutinized. The city has raised concerns about the profitability of the minimum bid and sought to delay the auction. Tenants obviously consider Summit to be a slumlord. On Wednesday, reporting from Bisnow\nrevealed\nconnections between Summit and Wiener\u2019s brother Jonathan Wiener.\nBut beyond the back and forth about the sale price and Summit\u2019s stewardship, the pushback is, in my estimation, really about tenants and the Mamdani administration sensing an opportunity to take these units outside the purview of a traditional private landlord and into something\u2026 else.\nWhat that something else is, well, they haven\u2019t quite worked that out. The words \u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cpreservation\u201d and \u201ccommunity land trust\u201d have been bandied around. I\u2019ve written before about the\nvery real and bold dreams of alternative ownership\nfrom advocates and city officials. But so far there\u2019s no clear vision of what tenants and Mamdani want for these units.\nWhat is clear is that they have a limited time to get it. A delay would have given them time to think and plan, but that effort was\nthrown out by the bankruptcy judge\n. Summit now all but holds the keys. There\u2019s a hearing scheduled to confirm the auction result on January 15, giving the city just days to throw around its weight.\nIt\u2019s not looking so good right now for the city, but what could happen next is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have so many examples that sort of show us what\u2019s possible here,\u201d Ariel Hirsch of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board told me at the rally.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho is buying rent-stabilized buildings? Since the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 gutted the ability of landlords to raise those rents, it\u2019s been said that rent-stabilized buildings are worth next to nothing. But clearly, someone is willing to pay for them. We\u2019ve already profiled Peter Hungerford. This auction will give us another name. We\u2019re hearing it\u2019s a lot of local long-term landlords who plan to stay in the business. Got info about the folks getting into the rent-stabilized game as everyone is getting out? Email\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nElsewhere:\n\u2014 Mamdani has\nendorsed\nClaire Valdez, a 36-year-old state Assembly member from Queens, in the race to represent New York\u2019s seventh district in Congress. The district is prime \u201cCommie Corridor\u201d territory, incorporating parts of Bushwick, Ridgewood, Clinton Hill, Williamsburg, Greenpoint and the mayor\u2019s own Astoria. Valdez is a fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America. The seat was previously occupied by Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and is also being pursued by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso.\n\u2014 More red light cameras are heading to New York City streets,\nwrites\nGothamist. The Department of Transportation has a goal of 600 cameras by the end of the year, up from 150.\nA thing we learned:\nA growing number of Americans are getting their mortgages from places that aren\u2019t banks. That number is now 64 percent, up from 42 percent in 2014.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$14 million\nfor 53 West 53rd Street, 59B. The Midtown Central condo is 3,200 square feet. The property was last sold as a new development in 2020 for $12.8 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$15.2 million\nfor 4275 Boston Road. The Eastchester industrial building is 72,248 square feet. UPS acquired the property from Excelsior Investors, who purchased the site five years ago for $8.1 million.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $11.9 million for 50 Bridge Park Drive, Unit 26A.

        "content": "Hyperion Group won increased incentives for its delayed Boynton Beach multifamily project in a deal presumed to be the local Community Redevelopment Agency\u2019s biggest-ever tax increment financing agreement.\nThis week, the\nBoynton Beach\nCRA approved a bump to $11.5 million from $9 million for the project that\u2019s expected to include 371 residential units, 25,600 square feet of retail space and a parking garage with 633 spaces, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe CRA also extended the term of the TIF agreement to 14 years from 12.\nThe eight-story project, called Ocean One, has been in the works since at least 2023, when the city\napproved the development.\nWinter Properties was part of the partnership at the time. Construction was expected to start in early 2024 and take two years.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Hyperion and New York-based Winter paid $12 million for the 3.7-acre development site at 114-222 North Federal Highway in 2021. Washington Real Estate Partners was the seller.\nThe increased subsidy is less than what Hyperion requested. The developer asked the CRA last year to raise the incentive to $16 million and stretch the deal to 15 years, citing a shifting economic landscape since the agreement was inked in May 2024.\nThe site is just north of Boynton Beach\u2019s downtown core. Arquitectonica is designing the development.\nCRAs can deploy taxpayer dollars to spur investment in redevelopment zones, often using TIF agreements to rebate a portion of future property tax revenue generated by developments.\nHyperion pointed to rising construction costs, persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, higher insurance premiums and uncertainty around tariffs, all of which it said had eroded the project\u2019s feasibility, in its request for additional subsidies.\nAn independent analysis commissioned by the CRA and conducted by Washington, D.C.-based Abramson &amp; Associates largely backed that assessment, finding Hyperion\u2019s revised cost projections \u201creasonable\u201d and concurring that broader economic conditions had worsened since the earlier agreement.\nCity officials previously described the $9 million incentive as the largest TIF package in the CRA\u2019s history.\nThe property sits within Boynton Beach\u2019s 2.6-square-mile redevelopment area, which has drawn interest as developers look for relatively cheap land between\nBoca Raton\nand\nWest Palm Beach\n.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Developer BGI Capital completed a $40.9 million acquisition of a development site adjacent to its nearly completed waterfront West Palm Beach condo tower, Alba Palm Beach.\nRecords show the Miami-based developer, led by Kenneth Baboun and Robert Barthelmess, bought the properties at 4720, 4802 and 4804 North Flagler Drive from Justo Naranjo, Beatriz Corrales, and Nataly Nicole Corrales for $33 million.\nThe purchase includes a waterfront single-family home and the 11 remaining units in the 4800 North Dixie condominium complex. That\u2019s in addition to the five units BGI bought for $7.9 million in 2023, according to property records.\nThe property is adjacent to BGI\u2019s\nAlba Palm Beach\n, a 22-story, 55-unit condominium set for completion this spring. Alba is 70 percent pre-sold, Baboun confirmed. BGI financed the purchase with a $25.6 million loan from a Linkvest Capital affiliate, according to property records.\nThe sites total 2.2 acres and 200 feet of waterfront, Baboun confirmed.\nThe developer is in the approval process for a second condo project tentatively dubbed Alba Reserve and slated for 31 stories and 87 units, according to city planning documents. BGI tapped Carlos Ott and Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners as the architects for the project. The tower will rise 360 feet, and units will be larger than in the adjacent Alba project, with square footage starting at 3,000 square feet, he confirmed. Baboun is also\nconsidering branding the project\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early to know what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in concept design, this is the exciting part.\u201d\nWhile the project is in early stages, Baboun made clear he is going for a luxe client with a bigger budget than his first West Palm Beach tower, where prices started at $2.5 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going high end all the way,\u201d he said, noting the strength of the market over $6 million.\nNaranjo is a local resident and real estate investor with a portfolio of properties throughout Palm Beach County, records show. He and his wife Beatriz Corrales bought the single-family home at 4720 North Flagler Drive for $1.7 million in 2014 and have it homesteaded.\nAfter the developer acquired the 1.7-acre Alba site for $5.8 million in 2020, Naranjo and his family members started acquiring units in the neighboring condo buildings, anticipating future developer interest. Records show they spent about $2 million buying the units.\nThe two planned towers are part of\na deep pipeline of condo projects\nin West Palm Beach that total more than 2,000 units. The rapid market growth has raised speculation about possible saturation, but Baboun said he sees \u201cdepth\u201d in the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conservative with our pipeline, we\u2019re in no hurry to launch projects as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that sales will not launch for this second tower for another year or two.\nBaboun said he sees a severe shortage of existing waterfront condos in the city.\nOther developers see it, too. Huizenga Holdings and Integra Investments are planning a $2 billion redevelopment of the waterfront around Rybovich Marina at 4200 North Flagler Drive that will include four towers with more than 660 residential units. Toronto-based Great Gulf is planning a 32-story, 97-unit tower at 5400 North Flagler Drive, a site it bought for\n$28.5 million\nin 2024.",

        "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom\nis taking aim at institutional investors making purchases in the residential market.\nFollowing a\nsimilar announcement by President Donald Trump\n, Newsom is\nplanning to work\nwith local legislators to prevent private equity and hedge fund investors and other corporate entities from purchasing homes in California, the Mercury News reported, citing communications with the governor\u2019s office.\n\u201cThe fact is that large investors are purchasing homes faster than families can buy them,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cThe governor believes that working families shouldn\u2019t be competing with large, well-capitalized investors.\u201d\nNewsom shared his approach in his State of the State address on Thursday.\n\u201cThere is another urgent area requiring our attention. That\u2019s institutional investors snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership, and forcing rents too damn high for everyone else. It\u2019s shameful that we allow private equity firms in Manhattan to become the biggest landlords in many of our cities,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, we will work with the Legislature to combat this monopolistic behavior, strengthen accountability, and level the playing field for working families. That means more oversight and enforcement, and potentially changing the state tax code to make this work,\u201d he said.\nAbout 3 percent of single-family homes in California are owned by large landlords; publicly traded\nInvitation Homes\nis the largest owner, according to a 2024 study by the California Research Bureau cited by the Mercury News. Large\ninstitutional landlords\nown less than 1 percent of total U.S. single-family housing inventory, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company analysts said in a statement this week, per the Mercury News.\nAfter Trump announced his intentions to take on institutional investors in residential real estate, stock share prices of single-family landlords fell by as much as 10 percent, according to the Mercury News. \u201cAt the risk of whistling past the graveyard, we could argue that the dip in the stocks presents a buying opportunity,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said in their report.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement is already being well received in the state legislature. Last year, the state assembly approved a bill that would ban large single-family residential property owners from buying and leasing more homes. The measure ended up stalling in the state Senate amid opposition from real estate agents and the California Apartment Association.\n\u201cHaving the governor\u2019s backing and support is going to be crucial and very helpful,\u201d Assemblymember Alex Lee, who authored that bill, said, vowing to pursue it again this year. Newsom has not endorsed a specific proposal.\nState Senator Scott Wiener also supports legislation targeting corporate landlords but shies away from policies that could choke housing production. \u201cThere\u2019s been a desire to do something about the gobbling up of single-family homes by institutional investors for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an issue that we need to deal with.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing the city\u2019s appetite for new housing in the South Loop, proposing a 19-story apartment building.\nA venture led by Vahooman Mirkhaef filed a zoning application to build a 237-unit residential building at 557\u2013571 West Polk Street. The proposal would replace a two-story office building that currently serves as the headquarters of Environmental Group Services, Mirkhaef\u2019s environmental consulting firm, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nDetails on construction costs and timing were not disclosed, but the plan would add to a\nsparse downtown\npipeline. Financing challenges over the past few years have sidelined many large projects, even as rents have rebounded sharply.\nJust three large-scale apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed downtown in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. That shortage has helped push rents up more than 8 percent, year over year, in the third quarter of 2025, the firm said.\nSome new building permits for apartments near the city\u2019s core are starting to take shape, however. Across the water in River North, a full building permit was issued last week for\nZSD\u2019s\nmixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot.\nMirkhaef\u2019s venture has owned the Polk Street property since 2003, according to the zoning filing. The original purchase price does not appear in Cook County property records. Mirkhaef did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe proposal includes 102 off-street parking spaces and would fall under Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nPlans\ncall for 12 affordable units to be built on site and another 12 elsewhere in the 28th Ward, with an in-lieu fee covering the remaining obligation.\nMirkhaef is also a controversial figure in local real estate and business circles. He previously operated Cub Terminal, a\nsuburban logistics depot\n, and in 2021 pleaded guilty to paying bribes to former state\nSen. Martin Sandoval\nto aid that business, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. In 2024, federal prosecutors declined to oppose his appeal to overturn the conviction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Rogers Park\u2019s most recognizable homes is heading to national television, and possibly a six-figure renovation.\nThe Candyland House, the pastel-drenched Victorian at 1525 West Pratt Boulevard in Chicago, is featured this season on HGTV\u2019s \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d giving the property a shot at a $150,000 makeover. The home appears in the show\u2019s seventh season, which premiered this week, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nOwners Joe Bergantino and Ricky Gonzalez said HGTV reached out in late 2024 about a potential appearance, without initially disclosing the show. When they learned the\nCandyland House\nwas being considered for \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d the couple took it in stride. Gonzalez told the outlet that they started laughing.\nThe show, hosted by comedian\nRetta\n, tours some of the country\u2019s most over-the-top fixer-uppers before selecting one for a full renovation led by \u201cSin City Rehab\u201d designer\nAlison Victoria\n. The winning home gets a fast-tracked overhaul that would otherwise take years for most owners to tackle.\nIn 2022. Bergantino and Gonzalez bought the house built in 1891 and have been slowly restoring it while documenting the process on Instagram. Longtime\nRogers Park\nresidents know the home for its candy-colored exterior and wildly imaginative interiors, a legacy of artists Jackie Seiden and the late Don Seiden, who coated nearly every surface in pastel hues, sometimes accented with glitter.\nWhen the Seiden family sold the house in 2021, neighbors worried the next owners might strip away its personality. Bergantino and Gonzalez promised to preserve the home\u2019s\neccentric spirit\n, and say that won\u2019t change even if HGTV selects it for the renovation.\n\u201cNo chance in hell would the renovation ever be black, white, gray or beige,\u201d Bergantino told the publication.\nFilming took place in June, with a 12-hour shoot expected to be edited down to a brief segment. The couple paused their own renovation work once they learned they\u2019d be featured, figuring an untouched interior might improve their odds of winning the makeover.\nWithout the\nHGTV\nboost, they estimate it would take roughly a decade to complete their plans. If selected, the transformation would take about six weeks \u2014 a dramatic shift in both timeline and cost.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project, deemed Sutro Cove, would rise on a site owned by longtime residents that live in two homes on nine lots, which firm founder Stanley Saitowitz said his team plans to subdivide into 20 units.\n\u201cThe property actually belongs to a family that grew up there,\u201d Saitowitz told SF Gate. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a few buildings around the city that present this\u2026 modern interpretation of the traditional texture of the city, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the design.\u201d\nThe buildings would feature floor-to-ceiling windows and inset balconies facing the Pacific Ocean. Units would feature repeating bay windows that Saitowitz said would create a \u201cwaving facade\u201d mimicking the ocean waves below. Residences at Sutro Cove would range from studios to four-bedroom units. Two of the apartments in the building would be set aside as deed-restricted\naffordable housing\nfor\nresidents making 80 percent\nof the area\u2019s median income \u2014 $87,300 for one person or $124,700 for a household of four.

Sutro Cove\u2019s design is inspired by the recently completed \u201cHouse of Fog\u201d at 2117 46th Avenue in the\nSunset District\n, which Stanley Saitowitz | Natoma Architects designed. That two-unit property is centered around a central courtyard and served as \u201ca prototype for the thinking around these houses,\u201d Saitowitz said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Starwood is expected to file the foreclosure Friday, ending Todd Interests\u2019 run at the property.\nTodd\nsaid his firm owes roughly $230 million on the building and won\u2019t contest the action. The decision, he said, comes down to math that no longer works: elevated interest rates, soft downtown values and apartment occupancy that has slipped below 80 percent.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication, adding that negotiations with\nStarwood\nwere cordial. \u201cIn 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nDallas-based Todd Interests and partners poured about $460 million into transforming the long-vacant, 1.5 million-square-foot tower at 1401 Elm Street. Opened in 1965 and shuttered in 2010 as office demand collapsed, the building sat empty for a decade before becoming one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country and the biggest in\nDallas\nhistory.\nThe redevelopment converted the mid-century office monolith into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail, backed by heavy public incentives. Todd once billed the financing as the largest historic tax credit deal in\nTexas\n, anchored by roughly $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing.\nTodd told the outlet that more than $150 million has already been repaid to tax credit investors, including Stonehenge Capital and AHP, Warren Buffett\u2019s tax-credit arm. The project was refinanced with Starwood three years ago, a deal that allowed Todd and major investor Moriah Real Estate to recoup about 90 percent of their investment. Much of that capital was plowed back into the building in hopes a rebound would follow.\nIt didn\u2019t. \u201cThe values aren\u2019t there,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe loan is due, and we\u2019re not going to continue to pay.\u201d\nThe foreclosure comes shortly after Todd Interests sold its stake in the nearby East Quarter redevelopment to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
