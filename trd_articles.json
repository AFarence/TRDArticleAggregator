        "content": "A top broker in New York City known for his dealings in Downtown Manhattan has executed a deal of his own.\nClayton Orrigo, co-founder of Compass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team, paid $6.5 million, or $3,400 per square foot, for a three-bedroom condo at 160 Leroy Street, according to public records.\nUnit 5A-N previously traded for $6.2 million in 2021. The home spans more than 2,000 square feet and has three bathrooms, 11-foot floor-to-ceiling windows and a windowed bathroom in the primary suite.\nOrrigo\u2019s team, which he launched with Stephen Ferrara in 2017, is headquartered in the building\u2019s retail space.\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t control the workload, I can control the commute,\u201d Orrigo said of his latest purchase. He added that he\u2019s \u201cbullish\u201d on the Hudson River-side condo, pointing to a recent $25 million deal he did for a 14th-floor apartment.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Arlene Gutterson had the listing.\n\nElsewhere in the West Village, Orrigo appears to have recently traded a co-op at 256 West 10th Street. He bought the apartment in 2017 for $2.1 million and embarked on\na gut renovation\nfeatured in Architectural Digest.\nTwo years earlier, he picked up a one-bedroom at 25 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village for $1.4 million, which he offloaded for $1.8 million in 2019.\nThree floors above Orrigo\u2019s new unit is a condo that just snagged a\nrecord rental deal\nfor the building at $40,000 a month, or $234 per square foot. The lease for the apartment, which sold for $7 million just two months ago, was signed by an executive at Michael Rubin\u2019s sports platform, Fanatics.\nHotelier Ian Schrager, Ares Management, Weinberg Properties and William Gotlieb Real Estate developed the 157-unit condominium, which launched sales in 2016. Since then, buyers at the building have included Rubin, who bought a penthouse for $44 million, and Jennifer Stengaard Gross, daughter of Pimco founder Bill Gross, who paid\n$28 million\nfor a penthouse.\nThe building is located blocks from KITH Ivy, a controversial\nnew private padel club at 120 Leroy\n. The club, backed by streetwear designer Ronnie Fieg, Midtown Equities and the owners of Cafe Mogador, just announced it would house the\ncity\u2019s first Erewhon\n, albeit a pared-down version of the Los Angeles grocery store.\nOrrigo and Ferrara\u2019s Hudson Advisory Team placed first among the city\u2019s top resale agents with $366 million in sell-side deal volume, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. The cohort also landed among the top 10 new development agents with $119 million in sales.\n",

        "content": "Toll Brothers paid $19.5 million for a site at Parkland\u2019s long-closed Heron Bay Golf Course, with plans for 52 single-family homes.\nThe Fort Washington, Pennsylvania-based homebuilder plans Saltgrass at Heron Bay on a nearly 21-acre site at 11773 Northwest 70th Place, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The city of Parkland sold the property to Toll Brothers.\nThe sale breaks down to $933,461 per acre.\nSaltgrass at Heron Bay will consist of four-bedroom and five-bedroom homes, ranging from 2,632 square feet to more than 4,000 square feet, Toll Brothers\u2019 website for the project shows. Ground-up construction and presales haven\u2019t started. Homes will have three-car and four-car garages.\nAsking prices are expected to start at $1.6 million, the website shows.\nLed by CEO Douglas C. Yearley Jr., Toll Brothers won a 2023 city solicitation for homebuilders to redevelop the Heron Bay Golf Course.\nAfter the 223-acre golf course closed in 2019, the North Springs Improvement District purchased it for $32 million in 2021, according to records and the city of Parkland\u2019s website.\n\nThe district, which provides water treatment and management to the cities of Parkland and Coral Springs, retained 150 acres for stormwater management and open space, and another portion was designated for a memorial for the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.\nParkland purchased the balance of the site for $25.4 million in 2023 and solicited offers for redevelopment, the city\u2019s website shows. Toll Brothers beat\n10 other developers\nto purchase the 21-acre portion of the golf course, including second-ranked K. Hovnanian Homes and third-ranked Mattamy Homes.\nToll Brothers\n, founded in 1967 in Philadelphia by brothers Bruce E. Toll and the late Robert I. Toll, is a luxury homebuilder that also develops apartments, according to its website.\nFor years, homebuilders have\nseized\non South Florida\ngolf courses\nas development sites. The large swatches of greens and fairways are one solution to the tri-county\u2019s limited supply of buildable land due to constraints by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Everglades to the west.\nLast year, Miami-based Lennar and the Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group launched sales of a\n103 single-family home community\nthey plan on a shuttered 104.3-acre golf course at 19650 Presidential Way near Aventura.\nMiami-based 13th Floor Homes plans a\n335 single-family home community\non the closed Woodlands Country Club at 4600 Woodlands Boulevard in Tamarac.\n",

While departures from heavyweights like USAA, Visionworks and PricewaterhouseCoopers left a glut of space, inquiries are picking up.\nAmegy Bank\u2019s recent 44,000-square-foot lease at 300 Convent was one of the few notable wins, but brokers say smaller deals in the 5,000- to 20,000-square-foot range could follow if momentum builds.\nJoe Bright, senior vice president at Partners Real Estate, told the outlet that more corporate tenants are requesting tours and surveys downtown, even if many stop short of signing.\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s still a little bit of a hangup in the execution,\u201d he said, pointing to parking and traffic perceptions as persistent hurdles. Bright believes tangible progress on Marvel construction will be the tipping point: \u201cOnce you start to see dirt moving \u2026 then it\u2019ll switch.\u201d\n\nOn the investment side, John Taylor, CBRE\u2019s senior vice president in San Antonio, said downtown is starting to look more attractive to buyers hunting for a bargain.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually received questions from a handful of clients saying, \u2018Where are some really nice quality buildings for reasonable or aggressive economics right now?\u2019\u201d Taylor said, adding that the answer increasingly points downtown.\nThe projects\u2019 potential aligns with a broader trend of repositioning central business districts into mixed-use neighborhoods rather than strictly office corridors. But with leasing demand still fragile and execution risk high, it\u2019s unclear whether Project Marvel\u2019s momentum can bridge San Antonio\u2019s vacancy gap.\nIf the buzz translates into leases, downtown could shift to a growth story. But for now, the market is watching and waiting for cranes to rise in the skyline.\nThe county\u2019s\nfunding\npiece for Project Marvel was sent to voters to\ndecide\nthis November by the Bexar County Commissioners Court in August, and while the San Antonio City Council voted recently to continue negotiations with Spurs Sports and Entertainment on a term sheet, it is\nunclear\nif Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones will continue to push back on the development.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Despite hints that the City Council would take its fight against housing ballot measures to the courts, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says the next phase will be a war of words.\nAdams on Wednesday said the Council will turn its attention to educating the public on three ballot questions it believes are misleading.\nThe Council had urged the city\u2019s Board of Elections to remove the questions from the ballot, arguing that the trio concealed from voters that power would be taken away from their elected officials on certain land use matters. The board overwhelmingly\napproved\nthe measures on Tuesday, along with two other questions that were not targeted by the Council.\nThough an attorney for the Council\nindicated last week\nthat the Council wasn\u2019t shy about suing the administration, Adams said Wednesday that it will instead focus on an \u201cintentional campaign\u201d to inform voters on the measures\u2019 consequences.\n\u201cWe were hoping that the BOE would see our side of it,\u201d she said when asked by a reporter about filing a lawsuit.\nAdams began Wednesday\u2019s press conference by defending the Council\u2019s reputation, calling claims that the Council isn\u2019t pro-housing \u201cpreposterous.\u201d She said it is \u201ccompletely dishonest\u201d to characterize the Council\u2019s land use powers as the biggest obstacle to housing production, noting that her guiding mantra has been: \u201cWe cannot be the Council that says no to housing.\u201d\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mayor Eric Adams said the Council \u201cwill now be remembered for trying to block voters from having a say in eliminating New York City\u2019s barriers to housing and bringing down the cost of rent.\u201d\nThe speaker repeatedly took shots at the mayor during the press conference, which preceded the Council\u2019s planned override of three bills the mayor vetoed.\nShe said the mayor \u2014\u00a0who has repeatedly bragged that he led the most pro-housing administration in the city\u2019s history \u2014\u00a0has been taking credit for the Council\u2019s work getting major rezonings and housing projects across the finish line. She touted the promise of a $5 billion investment ahead of the approval of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, saying the commitment wouldn\u2019t have happened without the Council (housing projections were also reduced as a result of changes sought by the Council).\n\u201cThis Council is doing the work. Not just talking about it,\u201d she said.\n\nThough the fight over these measures has, at times, become personal, the changes proposed would affect mayoral administrations and Councils beyond the officials now in office.\nOne of the three questions that the Council objects to asks whether the city should create a fast-track approval process for modest housing and infrastructure projects that bypasses either City Council or City Planning approval, depending on the project type. Another asks voters if the mayoral veto in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, should be replaced by a three-member appeals board for certain projects. The third proposal takes aim at districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Affordable housing projects in those districts would undergo a shorter review process, bypassing Council review.\nThe speaker said the Council\u2019s opposition to the questions is not about losing the power to block housing or even member deference, the Council\u2019s tradition of voting according to the local Council member\u2019s position on land use actions. She noted that the Council has, at times, defied member deference \u2014\u00a0though it remains a rare occurrence.\nThe Council, she went on, uses its authority to demand deeper affordability and neighborhood investments.\n\u201cDevelopers do not automatically produce housing that is affordable to New Yorkers without being pushed to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city often fails to invest in our communities unless pushed to do so by the Council.\u201d\nIf Wednesday\u2019s press conference is any indication, the Council\u2019s campaign around the ballot question will emphasize the potential of the mayor being handed more power, while\nunderscoring ties between the mayor and the Trump administration.\nProponents of the ballot questions, including Open New York and other housing groups, have\nlaunched their own campaign\n, aiming to spend $3 million on promoting the changes.\n\u201cThe actual questions on the ballot still maintain community input and Council members\u2019 authority when they are really trying to build more housing in their neighborhoods,\u201d Annemarie Gray, executive director of Open New York, said after the Board of Elections\u2019 vote. \u201cThese are very thoughtfully designed measures, to really target the worst actors and actually finally make a dent in our cost-of-living crisis.\u201d\n",

The deal has yet to register in public records and the buyer is unknown.\nJill Eber with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal.\nWallack founded\nMango\u2019s Tropical Caf\u00e9\nin 1991, and it has been a mainstay in Miami Beach\u2019s nightlife since then. He opened an Orlando restaurant in 2014, according to Mango\u2019s website. He also owns a 14.4-acre estate in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Dubbed Breezy Oaks, it has three freshwater grottos and is listed for $17.9 million, according to Zillow.\nWallack bought the North Bayshore Drive home, known as \u201cWhispering Pines,\u201d for $600,000 in 1996, property records show. The 3,900-square-foot home was built on 0.9 acres in 1969, and it has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, according to the listing. The property also has a treehouse, a music studio, a 140-year-old gazebo, a pool, dock and 125 feet of waterfront.\n\nEber said the size of the lot was a major draw. She declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s plans for the property, but said it was a great development opportunity.\n\u201cThis was pretty much about the property itself,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to find this kind of property with the water frontage you get on the wide bay.\u201d\nWallack listed it for $20.9 million in May, Zillow shows. The sale tops\nMorningside\u2019s\nprevious price record, which was set in 2021 when\nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy\ndropped $14 million on a waterfront home.\nPrice growth in nearby\nBay Point\nhas been even more explosive in recent years. In January, Fatos Rosenberg sold a waterfront estate in the neighborhood for more than\n$85 million\n.",

        "content": "Blackstone bought the 352-key East Miami hotel at Brickell City Centre.\nFunds affiliated with New York-based Blackstone bought the 40-story hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza in Miami from funds managed by Honolulu, Hawaii-based Trinity Investments and New York-based Certares, according to the sellers\u2019 news release. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nEast Miami is home to rooftop venue Sugar and also has 89 serviced apartments.\nThe sale marks the second time the hotel has traded in the past four years. In 2021, Trinity and Certares bought East Miami for\n$174 million\nfrom the developer, Swire Properties. Deeds recorded for that sale show the price was $120.3 million, but the larger price reported by media outlets likely is due to the addition of furniture and fixtures.\nMiami-based Swire, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Swire Properties, completed East Miami in 2016 as part of the\nBrickell City Centre\nmixed-use complex that spans about five city blocks. Aside from the hotel, the complex consists of about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; and a pair of office buildings.\nBlackstone, an alternative asset management giant led by CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, had about $1.2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, according to its website.\nThe firm has been active in South Florida, including selling off industrial properties in recent years. In June, the firm and its industrial properties arm, Link Logistics, sold a 43.7-acre development site planned for offices and warehouses at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road in Opa-locka for\n$105.7 million\n. The deal brought Blackstone and Link Logistics\u2019 South Florida sales since November to more than $1 billion.\n\nIn April, Blackstone paid\n$115.9 million\nfor the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes. The firm has also financed South Florida projects this year, providing a\n$300 million\nloan in May for Karim Alibhai\u2019s Gencom and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group\u2019s renovation of the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne at 455 Grand Bay Drive, and planned renovation of the Grand Bay Club at 425 Grand Bay Drive in Key Biscayne. The debt was a refinancing of a previous loan.\nIn the past five years,\nBrickell\nhas emerged as an epicenter of South Florida\u2019s luxury condo market and also became a magnet for out-of-state companies expanding and moving to South Florida.\nThe neighborhood has hosted continuing investment sales activity over the past year, despite elevated interest rates, a slower in-migration of new-to-market firms and other economic headwinds. Some buyers closed their purchases with all cash, avoiding more expensive financing.\nIn May, Melo Group paid more than\n$200 million\nfor the 2.8-acre Brickell City Centre development site at 700-799 Brickell Avenue. The seller, Swire, canceled its planned office supertall on the site, citing a \u201cchallenging\u201d office market amid slower preleasing. Also at Brickell City Centre, Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International bought a nearly 1-acre development site at 9 Southeast Sixth Street that\u2019s proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys for\n$45 million\n.\nSwire continued cashing out of Brickell City Centre this year, selling its 75 percent stake in the retail and parking portion at the complex to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\nin June.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, known for closing his deals in all cash, is under a\n$275 million\ncontract for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Coastal California might be one of the country\u2019s most desirable locations to buy a home, but investors in the Golden State are fleeing inland in search of deals.\nFrom the beginning of 2024 through this June, seven of California\u2019s 10 biggest increases in investor share of homebuyers were far away from the ocean, the Orange County Register\nreported\n, citing data from\nCotality\n, formerly known as CoreLogic.\nSan Jose and Greater Los Angeles continue to attract investors looking to purchase homes. But several inland cities, many in the Central Valley, saw the fastest increases in investor activity in that year-and-a-half period.\nIn third place is Hanford in the Central Valley, which saw 34 percent investor share of homebuying in the 18-month period compared to 16 percent from 2015 to 2023. Fresno, less than an hour north, witnessed 36 percent of home sales go to investors, contrasting 20 percent over the previous nine years.\n\nVisalia, another Central Valley city not far from Hanford, came in at number five with 35 percent investor interest versus 19 percent from 2015 to 2023. It was followed by Merced with 36 percent, up from 21 percent in the 2015 to 2023 period; Modesto in eighth place at 34 percent compared to 19 percent previously; Stockton with 34 percent investor purchases versus 20 percent in the preceding nine years; and Bakersfield rounding out the top 10 with 32 percent of homebuyers being investors compared to 18 percent from 2015 to 2023.\nAffordability was the likely driver in the uptick in investor interest, according to California Association of Realtors data cited by the Register. In 20 counties spanning Southern California, the Bay Area and the Central Coast, about 17 percent of households could afford to buy a home this spring, down from 21 percent four years prior. In 33 other counties outside those markets, median affordability was higher at 29 percent, though it was also a decrease from 39 percent in 2021.\nOverall, investors made 33 percent of\nhome purchases\nin California in the 18-month period ending in June, up from 21 percent in the nine-year period ending in 2023. The 12 inland metro areas saw the biggest jump among the state\u2019s three core markets, bringing in a median 32 percent investor share of homebuyers versus 19 percent in the previous nine years. By comparison, investor purchases in Southern California increased 11 points to 36 percent in the same period, while it was up 10 points to 34 percent in the Bay Area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "John McCallion is ready to take MetLife out of one of suburban Chicago\u2019s most high-profile retail corridors, even if it means selling property while a main tenant is having financial trouble.\nA couple years after McCallion-led MetLife Investment Management bought a fully leased Oak Brook shopping center for $41 million, the institutional landlord is testing the market as suburban retail makes a comeback.\nMetLife listed The Overlook at Oak Brook, a 54,000-square-foot property at 1715-1775 West 22nd Street, according to marketing materials. The firm tapped a JLL team to seek buyers for the property, even as a tenant leasing about 20 percent of the floor area, Guidepost Montessori, is making its way through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe property consists of seven free-standing buildings, with its other tenants including Smashburger, Verizon, Panera, Bibibop Asian Grill and Blackwood BBQ.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the property could fetch, though some Chicago CRE experts are concerned it will be less than MetLife paid due to Guidepost\u2019s problems, according to people familiar with the property. But MetLife persisting with its listing shows it believes the market will price through the potentially temporary blip for the property\u2019s Montessori space. The landlord paid cash for the property and has no mortgage debt to clear, meaning it isn\u2019t on the clock to sell ahead of a loan maturity, according to property records.\nAn insurance giant\u2019s investment arm testing the waters for retail, as other big Chicagoland shopping center properties are vying for deals, shows there\u2019s competition in the sector. The sale effort in Oak Brook comes as real estate players are revving up interest in Chicago-area retail.\nEarlier this year, a joint venture between\nDLC Management, Crow Capital Holdings and Temerity Strategic Partners\npaid nearly $62 million for the 314,800-square-foot Danada Square West property in Wheaton, near Oak Brook, from asset management firm PGIM. Plus, a team of Chicago developers late this summer put the 391,000-square-foot\nNewCity shopping center\nin the coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood up for sale.\n\nThe listings follow\nDRA Advisors\u2019 nearly completing its selloff\nof a massive portfolio of retail assets in the Midwest, concentrated in the Chicago area, which it acquired in a $2.3 billion buyout of an Inland Real Estate entity.\nMetLife and JLL didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nMetLife acquired the Overlook property in 2023 from GW Properties, the previous firm of developer\nMitch Goltz\nthat has since wound down as he started anew by founding\nGTZ Properties\nlast year. Goltz\u2019s old firm paid nearly $15 million to buy the property in 2018, when it held a 110,000-square-foot Macy\u2019s Furniture Gallery store before it moved to another nearby location.\nIt was then redeveloped through the pandemic into an anchorless shopping center, although the JLL team is now playing up its proximity to the adjacent, separately owned Costco, calling it a \u201cshadow anchor.\u201d Furthermore, Overlook at Oak Brook is kitty-corner from Oakbrook Center, the second-largest shopping mall in Illinois.\nGW dubbed the project a \u201cCovid special\u201d for weathering delays, inflation and rising rates, as the firm took on a $29 million loan for the redevelopment, property records show. GW sold the property to MetLife fully leased. It\u2019s 94 percent occupied today, according to JLL.\nJLL\u2019s Alex Sharrin, Moshin Mirza, Danny Kaufman, Michael Nieder, Brian Page and Danny Finkle are marketing the property on behalf of MetLife.\n",

The asking price for the five bedroom house is $956 per square foot. The 6,800-square-foot house sits on a nearly double lot at 1964 North Burling Street, one of the most exclusive blocks in the city.\nThe couple bought the property in 2002 after it was restored by developer Fred Latsko\u2019s firm, though the sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in public records. They later acquired the adjacent lot, creating a 50-by-123-foot parcel that gives the home a lawn, patio, rooftop decks and room to entertain.\nColette Cachey Smithburg\nand\nJoelle Hayes\nof @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate have the listing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history,\u201d Smithburg told the outlet, noting the carved stone fa\u00e7ade, ornate cornice brackets and preserved details like stone mantels and curved staircase railings. The main floor features herringbone-patterned hardwood floors, high ceilings and crown moldings, while a top-floor penthouse room with a bar opens onto a large rooftop deck tucked away from street view.\n\nThe property is in a neighborhood long reshaped by mega-mansions. The Burling corridor just south of Lincoln Park High School has seen teardowns give way to new construction over the last two decades. One neighbor\u2019s palatial estate\nfetched\nmore than $15 million last summer, while a modern villa next door\nclosed\nfor $6.75 million in July.\nThe listing underscores the appetite for historic homes that survived Lincoln Park\u2019s building boom. While many buyers have opted for glassy new builds, well-maintained 19th-century properties with extra land are rare and command a premium.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That was the last time the city\u2019s real estate market could be defined as \u201cnormal,\u201d according to SF Gate.\nRedfin used a mortgage payment-to-income ratio to make its calculation. By that metric, homes cost about as much as they did before the pandemic, relative to how much money people make.\nIn San Francisco, the median home price has risen 8 percent since July 2018. By contrast, the national median price surged 56 percent over the same time period. At the same time, annual household incomes have grown 7.7 percent in San Francisco, nearly double the 3.9 percent yearly increase across the country.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you find yourself back to normal, and there\u2019s not this big adjustment that happened,\u201d Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin, told SF Gate, noting that there hasn\u2019t been a \u201ccataclysmic event\u201d like a housing crash or a large decline in mortgage rates that would typically reduce housing costs.\n\nOakland is on track to return to \u201cnormal\u201d housing prices this month if prices remain stable or decline. It\u2019s a promising sign considering no other metro area in the U.S. is expected to reach \u201cnormal\u201d levels until Austin is predicted to in March 2027.\nWith the same calculation at a mortgage rate of 6.7 percent, Sacramento will return to \u201cnormal\u201d in November 2028, San Diego in February 2029 and San Jose in May 2029. Redfin\u2019s projections don\u2019t factor in property taxes or insurance costs, which weigh more heavily on California homeowners.\nAnaheim metro residents are seemingly out of luck, as prices will never return to normal there, according to Redfin\u2019s calculations. This is due to prices increasing so much that it would be virtually impossible to return to pre-pandemic levels, even over the next decade.\nMultifamily vacancy in the Bay Area dropped to 5.3 percent in the first quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s most recent published\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sky Developers is moving ahead with a big bet in Tribeca, locking down $320 million in construction financing for a ground-up condo project that will span an assemblage of Franklin Street lots, where\nprevious projects\nhave failed to make the grade.\nG4 Capital Partners provided the loan to the developer, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital arranged the deal, which will support a 280,000-square-foot condominium across three parcels: 65 Franklin Street, 59 Franklin Street and the corner site at 356 Broadway.\nThe assemblage had been in the hands of HAP Investments, the firm led by Eran Polack, which once planned a 19-story, 41-unit condo on the land. HAP picked up the site in 2018 for $46 million and spent years mulling a build that never got off the ground.\nIn March, the firm unloaded 360 Broadway to Sky for $57.6 million, according to Crain\u2019s, setting the stage for a fresh plan.\nHAP\u2019s website once teased a 101,000-square-foot mixed-use condo at 65 Franklin, but Sky\u2019s vision is significantly larger. A source told the Observer that the development will be \u201ca much bigger building than initially thought or planned,\u201d a sign of how bullish the firm is on the downtown condo market.\n\nThe site has historically been a contested one, wrapped in litigation. Charles Dayan\u2019s Bonjour Capital controlled 59 Franklin Street through an LLC, which sued HAP Investments and Noble Construction Group, claiming negligent work at 65 Franklin Street destabilized the building. He was seeking at least $15 million.\nBonjour once filed plans to build an 18-story, 89,000-square-foot building with 89 luxury rentals at 59 Franklin.\nElsewhere in Tribeca, Urban Capital Group and Prosper Property Group have\nassembled\na corner portfolio they plan to turn into a seven-story development with five full-floor loft condominium units and ground-floor retail.\nThe developers purchased the site at 32 Walter Street for $5.25 million. The 30,000-square-foot project is backed by a $32 million acquisition and construction loan from Kriss Capital.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The second quarter \u201cbegan with the Liberation Day tariffs and subsequent escalations,\u201d the CBRE report noted, \u201cbut the trade war rhetoric and effective tariffs have softened since then.\u201d\n\nEastGroup properties has a market capitalization of $8.7 billion and has owned the distribution center for decades.\u00a0 The warehouse was built in the 1970s but was renovated around four years ago.

EastGroup Properties has other industrial assets throughout Los Angeles.\nThe change in plans follows a pickup in sales for industrial property in L.A.

        "content": "Tenants in a Koreatown apartment building have staged a protest after the landlord proposed replacing parking garage spaces with accessory dwelling units.\nResidents of the 22-unit building at 501 South Kingsley Drive are standing up to the landlord\u2019s plan to remove several spaces used by tenants and convert them into five ADUs, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Though tenants are opposed to the move, state and city government officials have given the green light to the redevelopment.\nThe replacement of car spaces with\nADUs\nin infamously parking-strapped Koreatown is made possible by Senate Bill 1211, which passed last year. Under that law, local agencies are not required to replace parking spaces for tenants if the spaces are demolished by owners and property managers to make way for ADUs in an effort to increase housing density.\nTo show their opposition to the removal, tenants of the apartment building, at 5th and Kingsley,\u00a0 set up a peaceful protest using a long white plastic table and outdoor chairs to occupy some parking spaces. The protest has been going for three weeks after they were informed that building management company North Oak Property Management was pursuing an ADU conversion plan.\n\u201cWe found the permits online before they ever announced anything,\u201d resident Megan Thomas Bradner told the outlet. \u201cThey actually never officially notified us of the construction. All it said was, \u2018You have no parking as of this day.\u2019\u201d\nThe Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety approved its permit in April and offered tenants a monthly $200 credit for each parking spot lost as well as a \u201cTenant Habitability Plan,\u201d a spokesperson for North Oak Property Management told the outlet. But the habitability plan the tenants received was blank, the outlet said.\nThe protestors at 501 South Kingsley have been able to delay the project so far. Construction was expected to start late last month and wrap up next June, but the sit-in protest has seemingly cauased the project to pause.\nAnother garage-to-ADU conversion project at 450 South Normandie Avenue received a stop-work order. That rendered the parking spaces useless for residents and the owner.\n\nMark Nassab, building owner for 450 South Normandie, said the project has been in full compliance with city and state law since the beginning.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to help the city of L.A. combat shortages of housing, and we\u2019re following the law, and I wish tenants would do the same,\u201d Nassab said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to provide more housing.\u201d\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Heather Hutt has fielded letters from tenants, as have the Los Angeles City Planning Department and other agencies. Hutt is opposed to the legislation that allows for parking-to-ADU conversions without resident feedback.\n\u201cDecisions are being made in Sacramento without local input,\u201d Hutt said. \u201cLocal governments are better equipped and designed to work directly with the community.\u201d\nParking-to-ADU conversions are legal, but if parking spaces were part of a tenant\u2019s lease agreement, that could entitle the tenants to a rent reduction, a Los Angeles Housing Department spokesperson told the outlet.\nThat doesn\u2019t appear to be the case at 501 South Kingsley.\n\u201cWhat blew my mind was that my lease is apparently just a sheet of paper. It doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d resident Mel Raymond told the outlet. \u201cI thought my lease was something that protected me.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Elsewhere in DuPage County there are three more apartment complexes underway. Those include an 87-unit project in downtown Itasca, a 334-unit\nbuilding\nin downtown Wheaton, and a project that could\nlead\nto 600 apartments in Lombard\u2019s Yorktown Center mall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Only one place in the state, Santa Barbara, falls into that category, according to 2020 census\ndata\ncited by Cal Matters.\nThe bill looks to hold back the proposed CEQA exemptions to any projects next to a wetland, a creek and a state-registered historical landmark. It also includes a carveout for projects larger than four acres and those that use\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\nfor development.\nBy process of elimination, those provisions seemingly describe just one project in Santa Barbara: A 270-unit, eight-story building proposed for construction behind the city\u2019s historic Old Mission, according to Cal Matters.\nThe district is represented by Sen. Monique Lim\u00f3n, the incoming leader of the State Senate.\n\nThe planned development has sparked outrage among local residents and city officials, with Mayor Randy Rowse\ndecrying\nit as a \u201chorrendous nightmare.\u201d\nMission LLC, the developers behind the project, have repeatedly sued the city of Santa Barbara claiming the local government has illegally delayed the project and denied awarding a religious-based property tax exemption.\nLim\u00f3n has denied that she is out to prevent Mission LLC\u2019s project with her proposed legislation.\nOpponents of the project have flagged the danger of wildfires and flooding risk in the site north of downtown Santa Barbara. The city, in response, said that the new CEQA exemption legislation, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in July, doesn\u2019t apply to the project based on its interpretation of the law. SB 158 reaffirms that position.\nThe 11th-hour exemption is one part of a broader budget trailer bill, meant to direct state agencies on how to distribute the annual budget but often become political lightning rods as a means of trying to effect policy changes. Budget bills, unlike other legislation in the body, are written by the entire budget committee rather than individual legislators.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "As the summer heat broke in Manhattan in August, so did a streak of record-breaking rents.\nMedian rent for a new, brokered lease in Manhattan last month fell to $4,600, according to the monthly rent report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. That\u2019s a 2 percent\ndecline from the peak reported in July\n.\nSo ends a period of record-high prices that\nbegan in February\n. The numbers reflect the forces beginning to moderate rents in the city, including falling mortgage rates. But just because rents aren\u2019t rising, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re likely to fall significantly, according to report author Jonathan Miller. Manhattan rents in August were still the third-highest in history and have increased more than 8 percent in a year.\n\u201cPretty significant price growth is being maintained,\u201d said Miller.\nThirty-year mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since October last month. When those rates come down, that entices would-be renters to consider buying a place of their own and, in turn, removes some demand from the rental market.\nBut it\u2019s still fairly surprising that a new record wasn\u2019t set in August, considering it\u2019s typically a high-demand season, according to Miller.\n\u201cRents started banging against the wall of records beginning in January,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this year so unusual is that it\u2019s had a defiance of seasonality.\u201d\n\nThe\nFederal Reserve is widely expected\nto cut interest rates at its meeting next week, which could moderate mortgage rates \u2014 and potentially rents \u2014 further.\nAnother factor perhaps influencing rent movement is\nthe FARE Act\n, the city law that prohibits brokers from charging fees to tenants who didn\u2019t hire them, after it went into effect in June. Listing inventory as measured by the report fell in both Manhattan and Brooklyn, as brokers and landlords may be working out how to comply with the law. Listing inventory in Manhattan fell 10 percent month over month, and 13 percent in a year.\nThe Elliman data only includes new leases. It\ndoesn\u2019t capture any increases in lease renewals\n, which account for about two-thirds of leases in Manhattan, according to Miller.\nThe FARE Act may be enticing landlords to pursue those renewals, according to Allia Mohamed, CEO of the\nrenter platform openigloo\n. Landlords with units already filled might see the value in avoiding a potentially hefty broker\u2019s fee. Historically, openigloo data shows rent increases associated with lease renewals are typically modest, around 5 percent year over year.\nAlthough rents fell in Manhattan, Brooklyn was a different story. The median rent for a new, brokered lease reached $3,950, an all-time high. (Trends in the borough are often just slightly behind those in Manhattan, Miller said).\nNabbing a rental remains competitive. About one-third of new Brooklyn leases were subject to bidding wars, which raised prices on those units an average of 11 percent. In Manhattan and Northwest Queens, about one-quarter of leases were signed after bidding wars.\nIn Northwest Queens, the median rental price reached $3,775, a 0.7 percent increase from July and a 6.6 percent increase over last August.\n",

        "content": "The industry is scrambling to ensure Andrew Cuomo is the next mayor. The industry is resigned to a socialist mayor.\nBoth these things can be true because, unlike\nthe Borg\n, the real estate industry isn\u2019t a cybernetic collective with shared consciousness.\nRelated Companies CEO Jeff Blau threw up the bat signal Monday night, calling on fellow developers and other ultrawealthy donors to meet the next morning,\nthe New York Times reported\n. According to the Times, the attendees convened to strategize former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s path to victory. Whether this translated to a concrete action plan or simply executives cutting checks in the Pool Room of the Seagram Building, is unclear.\nOf course, if the strategy is to throw more money on the campaign, that is pretty much the same strategy employed pre-primary.\nMeanwhile, some affordable housing developers are concluding \u2014\u00a0as the Borg like to say \u2014\u00a0resistance is futile.\nA developer told me\nlast week\nthat folks in this space are meeting Mamdani and keen to be part of his agenda-setting and administration-building conversations. The Wall Street Journal spoke with developers who are\ndrafting housing proposals\nfor Mamdani.\nSome in the industry decided to support Mamdani post-primary, simply because he\u2019s the Democratic nominee. As I\u2019ve previously\nreported\n, professionals in the affordable and nonprofit housing world, as well as other sectors (property management, construction, architecture and brokerage) have also donated to his campaign, though not to the same degree we\u2019ve seen with Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams.\nThe point is: there are many rooms in this industry, not just the Pool Room. Even within each of these rooms, there are variations. (Related, one of the city\u2019s largest developers, got its start in affordable housing, which it still builds in addition to luxury residential, office towers, etc.)\nAnd how the people in these rooms view the race is fluid.\nA poll by the New York Times and Siena University found that 46 percent of likely voters intend to cast their ballot for Assembly member Zohran Mamdani. The polls showed Cuomo in second with 24 percent.\nThe margins narrow considerably if the race becomes a two-way contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, with the former taking 48 percent and the latter 44 percent of the vote. Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa have maintained that they are staying in the race, and even if they drop out, they will likely\nremain on the ballot\n.\nStill, if the race narrows to two contenders, the calculus may change for those looking to work with Mamdani. It is going to be a long two months!\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you a developer who decided against pursuing a project \u2014\u00a0either in the very early stages or once public review has started \u2014\u00a0because the local Council member made their opposition clear? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Vatican has had an observatory since 1891, which is now run by Guy Consolmagno, who is known as the \u201cPope\u2019s Astronomer,\u201d\naccording to the New Yorker\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Testimony got heated during recent public hearings about the downstate casino bids,\nThe City\nreported. At meetings in Queens and the Bronx, supporters and opponents weighed the value of the promised community benefits and economic activity of two controversial proposals for new developments atop public parks: Steve Cohen and Hard Rock International\u2019s bid for Citi Field and Bally\u2019s proposed casino at Ferry Point Park.\n\u2014 Greenpoint residents are complaining about worsening fumes, dust and odors from Long Island City\u2019s Green Asphalt plant, according to\nGothamist\n. The plant says it hasn\u2019t changed its operations since opening in 2011, but locals believe the problem has gotten noticeably worse over the last three years. The Department of Environmental Conservation has cited the facility for air quality violations and ordered it to raise its smokestack and add emissions controls. Compliance, however, remains unclear.\n\u2014 Apartment construction in the city took a nosedive, declining 67 percent this year, according to data from CoStar,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. Developers pointed to the new 485x tax abatement for driving up costs and eroding returns, while shifting investments toward existing buildings instead of new ones.\u00a0 \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$14 million\nfor a 6,000-square-foot co-op at 1010 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Sheila Ellis and Patricia Wheatley of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$56.7 million\nfor a project that includes 372 Schermerhorn Street and 475 State Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The two buildings are part of a proposed 538-unit project dubbed One Third Avenue;\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nin August on Alloy Development securing $500 million for the development.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$26.8 million\nfor a 3,347-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. The Mercedes Berk Team with Engel &amp; Volkers has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 42,794-square-foot mixed-use project at 42-62 24 Street in Long Island City. This plan includes an attended parking garage with retail to accompany the 39-story residential project by Grand Construction &amp; Development at 23-07 43 Avenue.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

At full buildout,\nEastVillage\nis slated to include a 1.5 million-square-foot health and life sciences campus, 350,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, hotels, entertainment space, 2,500 multifamily units and more than 450 single-family homes.\n\nCBRE\u2019s Zack Holderman, Jesse Greshin, Bob Ybarra, Jim Korinek and Doug Birrell arranged the financing.\nHolderman\ncalled the structure a win in what he described as a \u201cchallenged life science construction environment,\u201d noting that the deal provided more than 70 percent loan-to-cost in a sector where capital has tightened.\nConstruction on the life sciences campus started a year ago, with BillionToOne expected to move into its building by late 2026. A timeline for the other five buildings hasn\u2019t been announced, though Gordon Reger, CEO of\nReger Holdings\n, has said full buildout of EastVillage is seven to 10 years away.\nFounded in 2016, BillionToOne develops DNA-based diagnostic tests to detect a range of health problems. Its rapid ascent to unicorn status underscores why developers and lenders still see opportunity in the lab sector despite market headwinds.\nThe project marks another swing at scaling up its life sciences ecosystem in Austin, which has lagged traditional biotech hubs.

Amy Carr with Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Wellington brought the buyer, and Cameron Wentworth Scott with Wellington Equestrian Realty had the listing.\nJohn Malone is a cable magnate and billionaire with a net worth of $11.2 billion, according to Forbes. He is the chairman of Engelwood, Colorado-based Liberty Media, and was CEO of Tele-Communications from 1973 to 1996. As a major shareholder in Discovery, Inc., he was integral to the $43 billion merger with WarnerMedia in 2022, according to\npublished\nreports\n. Through Liberty Media, he also has holdings in Formula 1 and the Atlanta Braves. Dubbed the \u201cCable Cowboy,\u201d Malone is the second largest landowner in North America, with a portfolio of 2.2 million acres, according to the\nLand Report\n. The largest landowner is billionaire lumber mogul Red Emmerson.\nMalone\u2019s wife, Leslie Malone, is an equestrian and patron of the U.S. Olympic Dressage team.\nThe couple bought the 7,300-square-foot Hurlingham Drive house for $7.8 million in 2013, according to property records. Built on 0.9 acres in 1998, the home has seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, records show. It is part of the gated Palm Beach Polo &amp; Country Club neighborhood, and adjacent to the 92-acre Cypress Preserve, which is considered Florida\u2019s largest remaining Cypress Hammock, according to published reports.\n\nThe Malones listed the house for $16 million last year, Zillow shows.\nThe buyer, Charlie Jacobs, is the son of Jeremy Jacobs, who founded the concessions giant Delaware North. The Buffalo, New York-based firm provides food services for Wembley Stadium,\nMetLife Stadium\n, Busch Stadium, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, according to its website.

        "content": "Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation is breaking into a new market sector.\nThe Boston-based real estate investment firm, in a joint venture with Marina del Rey-based LaTerra Development, acquired EZ Access Self Storage in Santa Clarita, Multi-Housing News\nreported\n. The 784-unit facility at 23715 Carl Court sold from a private seller in a $27 million off-market deal.\nThe transaction marks Intercontinental\u2019s first foray into the self-storage sector. The property consists of nine single-story buildings and a separate office and residential unit for on-site management, in total spanning 100,000 square feet on a 4.2-acre site. The facility was completed in 1999 and boasts drive-up access for 222 of the 784 units.\nIntercontinental and LaTerra plan to breathe new life into the property with a capital improvement program including upgrades to the management office, hallway lighting, entry security and on-site landscaping.\nThe former EZ Access property will be rebranded as a Public Storage, which has been tapped as the management company to oversee day-to-day operations on the site. It will be one of eight Public Storage facilities within a 3-mile radius, according to Multi-Housing News, citing Yardi Matrix\ndata\n.\n\nIn total, residents will have more than 15 square feet of rentable space per capita. In the Los Angeles metro, self-storage space is at 5 square feet per capita, below the national average of between 10 and 13 square feet per capita.\n\u201cThe market is significantly under-supplied,\u201d Bryan Miranda, managing director of self-storage at LaTerra, said in a statement,\nper\nthe Boston Real Estate Times. He noted that self-storage has \u201coutperformed all real estate asset classes over the past 25 years.\u201d\nAs of July, there were 3,043 storage properties in all stages of development across the United States, according to Yardi Matrix\u2019s report. In Los Angeles, annualized average rent in the self-storage sector was $30.37 per square foot \u2014 nearly double the national average of $16.91.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Boca Raton City Council agreed to wait for a voter referendum before formally approving a 99-year lease that would enable Miami-based Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group to build apartments, condos, retail, and offices on public land.\nOn Tuesday evening, elected officials instructed the city attorney to add in a referendum clause to any proposed lease after hearing from dozens of residents who demanded a special election on the latest plans by Terra and Frisbie to build on 30 acres of city-owned land at West Palmetto Park Road and Northwest Second Avenue.\nUnder the revised plan, Terra and Frisbie would build 580 apartments, 160 condos, 80,000 square feet of retail, and 250,000 square feet of offices along with a redesigned Memorial Park, a new city hall and community center and other public improvements.\nFrisbie managing partner Ron Frisbie, Jr. and Terra CEO David Martin said the new design is far less dense than their earlier 1.5-million-square-foot proposed project that included 912 residential units, 150 hotel rooms, 350,000 square feet of offices and 152,000 square feet of retail.\nFrisbie told council members the developers downsized their project and added more green space in\nresponse to residents\nwho appeared a week prior at city hall in droves to oppose the mega-development.\u00a0 He also said he was not against holding a referendum and agreed to hold public workshops with residents on Sept. 29 at the city\u2019s downtown library and on Oct. 6 at the Spanish River Library, both at 4 p.m. Plus, Frisbie said his team was eager to meet with local homeowners\u2019 associations and would not push for a development agreement to be approved by late October, as the city originally scheduled.\n\u201cWe need to get the community behind this project,\u201d Frisbie told council members. \u201cThis is a [really] exciting plan and they should get to vote on it.\u201d\nBesides removing the hotel concept and reducing the number of units and retail space, the new Terra-Frisbie plan includes a new tennis center with up to 10 clay courts, a playground that will incorporate banyan trees on site, a World War II memorial and a new children\u2019s museum.\n\nA reduced site plan, though, also means less money for the city in terms of rent and taxes. Under the larger plan, the developers said they would pay out about $3 billion over the course of the 99-year lease. Through the scaled-down plans, the developers would pay the city about $2.1 billion. Terra and Frisbie would also obtain a developer fee for building a new city hall and other public facilities, although Frisbie said his team was still committed to providing $10 million for a pedestrian bridge near Brightline\u2019s Boca Raton station between the government campus and Mizner Park.\nBut the new concessions did little to dissuade opposition from critics who now collected 7,000 signatures for an ordinance or charter amendment that would require a public vote prior to the sale or leasing of more than a half-acre of public land. About 1,000 of those signatures were collected over the weekend when Boca Raton was hit with torrential storms, said Jon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca.\n\u201cRight now, the land is public. They want to get it into their possession. And once they get it, they will have full control over it for the next 99 years,\u201d Pearlman said.\nSeveral residents said they would rather the city renovate or replace city hall and other public facilities on its own, without handing over public land and attracting more traffic that would ruin Boca Raton\u2019s small town appeal. In addition, the present plans still include moving some of Memorial Park\u2019s recreational facilities, such as its two softball fields, to other parts of the city.\nIn February, Terra and Frisbie beat out\nWest Palm Beach-based Related Ross and two other development teams\nin a city bid for the redevelopment of Boca Raton\u2019s \u201cgovernment campus\u201d area. At the time, the Terra-Frisbie project was 2.5 million square feet and included 1,129 residential units.\nAside from that project, Terra and Frisbie are also moving forward\nwith redeveloping the Palm Beach Kennel Club site\nin Palm Beach County with as many as 1,145 apartments.\nBoca Raton and nearby West Boca Raton have attracted increased attention from developers. Among developments moving forward is a\n$101 million, 306-unit apartment project\nthat is slated to be built by Mill Creek and Group P6 in downtown Boca Raton. Local developers James and Marta Batmasian also received the backing of the Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board to\nbuild two 12-story hotel towers by Mizner Park.",

It also claims that John failed to provide evidence of an agreement with Prime that outlined exactly how the loans would be paid to John.",

Inventory has been trending up in the area since 2022.\n\u201cLast year, we were still solidly in a seller\u2019s market with low inventory. In some areas, we had less than a month inventory on the market,\u201d said Paul Epperley, president of the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\nCowtown is more stable than Dallas and other major Texas cities. Tarrant County had 3.9 months inventory last month, while Dallas County had 4.7, and Texas had 5.5.\n\u201cDallas had a little bit of an explosion of inventory in the second quarter this year,\u201d Epperley said.\n\nActive listings are up 11 percent year over year, and closings are up 2 percent in Tarrant County.\nClosings in the Fort Worth suburb Aledo are up a whopping 500 percent year over year, due to the Walsh Ranch development, which is projected to deliver 18,000 homes once complete.\nColleyville is one of the only areas in Tarrant County where the average price per square foot rose 11 percent or more, along with the zip code that includes Meacham International Airport.\nPrices rose modestly in suburban Grapevine and east Keller to the north, and in Benbrook, Kennedale and Arlington to the south and east. Prices dipped along the Interstate 35 West corridor, from Burleson to west Keller, and plummeted in downtown Fort Worth and the Haltom City area.Other Texas metros are more firmly in a buyer\u2019s market.\nAustin had one of the highest seller-to-buyer ratios in the country this summer\n, and months of inventory grew especially high in the luxury and\ncondo\nsubmarkets. In San Antonio,\nwhere sellers have been reluctant to adjust\ntheir expectations with the market,\nsales plunged 10 percent year over year in July\n.\n",

Morgan Asset Management declined to comment. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Josh King is running the process.\n\nThe asking price for the roughly 587,000-square-foot building works out to about $450 per square foot.\nJPMorgan paid $470 million for the 1980s-era building in 2013 from BXP (then known as Boston Properties), which had acquired it as part of the $3.9 billion deal to buy a portfolio of buildings previously owned by Harry Macklowe, including the General Motors Building.\nJust a few weeks after JPMorgan put the property up for sale in early 2020, the first cases of Covid appeared in New York and the city went into shutdown. Many owners pulled their properties from the market and reassessed their plans.\nIn the meantime, the city\u2019s office market has gone from doom and gloom to recovery. Early on, vacancies spiked and many questioned whether workers would ever return to the office like they had pre-pandemic.\nNow, Manhattan\u2019s office leasing activity is on track to record its best year since 2019. Still, with high interest rates and the costs associated with attracting new tenants, many buildings are still trading at discounts to previous valuations.\n",

Records show a Lennar affiliate bought the land at the intersection of Krome Avenue and Southwest 288th Street from Pedro Adrian\u2019s Adrian Homes.\nAdrian bought the properties for a combined $11.5 million in a pair of deals in 2022 and 2023, according to property records.\nMiami-based Lennar applied for a rezoning last year, planning records show. Miami-based Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates designed the site plan. It utilizes a 25 percent workforce housing density bonus, allowing for 3.1 dwelling units per acre, the plans show.\n\nLennar\nhas already launched sales for Redlands Ridge, although it is currently advertising only 78 homesites, its website shows. The planned homes range in size from 1,800 square feet to 2,800 square feet, with three bedrooms to five bedrooms. Prices range from $646,000 to $816,000, the website shows.\nLennar, led by Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller and co-CEO and President Jon Jaffe, is one of the largest homebuilding companies in the country. It has a prolific pipeline in South Florida, with thousands of units planned across the region.\nIn June, Lennar proposed a\n106-townhome project\nnear Homestead. That same month, it won approval for a 50-townhome project in\nWilton Manors\n, with prices starting at $800,000. In February, it proposed\nRodan Estates\n, a development with 192 single-family homes in south Miami-Dade County.\nMore recently, the developer landed a high-profile investor. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 7 million shares for\nnearly $800 million\n. News of the cash influx sent Lennar\u2019s stock surging, and it now sits at $140 per share as of 2 p.m. on Thursday.",

        "content": "California legislators are looking to stop some of the bleeding brought on by Measure ULA, or the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d in the City of Los Angeles.\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers released a bill that seeks to cut tax rates for some newly built multifamily and commercial properties, LAist\nreported\n. Luxury homes would still be subject to the full tax levy under the new proposal, save for those rebuilt after a natural disaster in the previous five years.\nThe move is purportedly being done in response to criticism that Measure ULA p\nushes away developers\nwhen increased housing production is desperately needed in the city. Since April 2023, the voter-approved Measure ULA has imposed a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on transactions totaling more than $10 million.\nIn the more than two years since then, Measure ULA is estimated to have collected $830 million in revenue to fund rent relief, eviction defense and affordable housing programs. However, only a small fraction of the funds have been spent actually building multifamily affordable housing as of May, according to the city\u2019s most recent\nbudget report\ncited by LAist. The tax\u2019s application to any sale of any property at more than $5 million\u2013regardless of profit margins\u2013has also been cited as a damper on development in the City of Los Angeles specifically.\n\nIn the new bill, co-authored by state senators Lena Gonzalez and Tina McKinnor, some commercial properties built within the last 15 years would have their ULA tax lowered to 1.5 percent. It would also relax some financing restrictions in Measure ULA, such as the requirement that financially distressed apartment buildings that received city funding could only be sold to certain buyers, such as nonprofit organizations and community land trusts.\nThe signs appear to confirm a drop-off in development as a result of Measure ULA. Economic reports cited by LAist claim the tax has caused a sharp decline in housing development activity across the city, with one University of California, Los Angeles study estimating the city would have more affordable housing units if the tax did not apply to new apartment buildings.\nThe new bill will need to be approved by tomorrow in order to make any changes to Measure ULA before the end of the legislative session. In the meantime, the Los Angeles Housing Department is gearing up to\ndistribute a record $387 million\nlargely raised via the mansion tax to build affordable multifamily residences.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "More lenders are going to court to collect debts from Chris and Aneta Urban, whose South Side fix-and-flip business buckled last year as unpaid debts stacked up.\nNewly filed lawsuits brought against the brother-and-sister builders by a fellow member of a local real estate training program are the latest in a string of disputes centered on the Urbans and dozens of their properties across Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs, with more than 80 properties in foreclosure proceedings. Chris Urban\u2019s former mentor, Andrew Holmes, is suing the siblings for fraud.\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving the same runaround, that they\u2019re working with their attorney, that they\u2019re trying to sell his bulk portfolio, and he wants to settle the balance owed,\u201d Wendy Valencia, one of the individuals Chris Urban met and borrowed from through the Holmes network, said of the Urbans. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s not going to happen because [Chris Urban] is in foreclosure on all the properties, he\u2019s just given out second mortgages like candy, and he doesn\u2019t have equity.\u201d\nStarting in about 2019, the Urbans began buying and rehabbing homes in the South Side, selling some and later venturing into rentals. The Urbans had amassed a portfolio of more than 100 properties, along with a debt of more than $14 million, when they began to have trouble paying their debts,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\nThey borrowed money from fellow members of the Andrew Holmes Mastery Program, a real estate investment training program based in Lombard, as well as Chicago-based lender Renovo Financial.\nValencia is seeking to foreclose on three properties where she loaned the Urbans money that she says wasn\u2019t paid back. Valencia has been in contact with other individual lenders who are planning to foreclose on the Urbans\u2019 properties, and a group of lenders is considering a fraud lawsuit.\nValencia had been lending the Urbans money for their business since 2019, and for a long time she said the debts were being paid without issue. That changed in 2024, when they started to fall behind.\n\u201cHe started to run behind on payments. Just started to get a little bit later and later,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cAnd it would always be just an excuse after another, just something would come up, but then he would send the payment.\u201d\nBut in February, around the time Renovo launched foreclosure proceedings against dozens of the Urbans\u2019 properties, Valencia said the operation fell apart and all payments stopped. Chris promised the individuals from the Andrew Holmes network that he would make good on his debts to them after he finished rehabs and sold his properties, Valencia said. But as time went on, Valencia said she lost faith that she would be repaid.\nChris Urban declined to comment on the ongoing disputes, saying he will resolve them \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nValencia is suing to foreclose on 8014 South Yates Boulevard, where she obtained a second lien in January. Valencia loaned the Urbans $170,000 for a property on South Aberdeen Street in 2024. When they started to fall behind on payments, Valencia said she accepted a short sale of the property and was given second lien positions on two other properties, including 8014 South Yates Boulevard, as collateral for the $80,000 the Urbans still owed her.\nBut that second position lien wasn\u2019t recorded in public records for five months, and the Urbans never made payments on the loan, Valencia said. In April the Urbans gave the South Yates property up to the first lender, VC New Concept LLC, through a quit claim deed without a public record of Valencia\u2019s second lien and without her knowledge, she said.\nValencia is now suing for foreclosure, arguing the property\u2019s first mortgage and ownership merged when VC New Concept was given the real estate, giving her a first lien on the property. She is suing VC New Concept and Fidelity National Title Company, arguing they knew about the second position and the failure to record it harmed her.\nVC New Concept is run by Valdy Biernacki, a real estate broker and investor in Palos Hills. Biernacki did not return a request for comment.\n\nValencia\u2019s experience is shared by other private lenders who knew the Urbans through Holmes\u2019 mastery program, she said, and other lenders are planning to foreclose on properties in the near future.\nIn cases with other investors, Valencia said Urban would do a short sale on properties to satisfy the first mortgage, selling them to another LLC he operates and taking out another private mortgage to fund the purchase. Property records show several instances in which one of the Urbans\u2019 LLCs sold a property to Construction &amp; Technology Solutions, another LLC operated by Chris Urban and Tomasz Szumny.\n\u201cHe basically would do a short payoff with a private lender, and he wouldn\u2019t disclose that he was selling a property to another one of his entities,\u201d Valencia said.\nAndrew Holmes, along with his business partner Mary Desloover, is suing the Urbans for allegedly running a \u201cPonzi-like scheme\u201d by taking loans from individuals intended for rehabilitations to pay off their troubled debts across their properties,\nTRD previously reported\n. The Urbans moved to dismiss the lawsuit in July, arguing Holmes and Desloover didn\u2019t provide enough evidence they had acted fraudulently. Holmes and his attorney declined to comment on the proceedings, and they have until Oct. 1 to reply to the motion.\nValencia is also suing to foreclose on two other properties that she has a first mortgage on through another LLC, Elixir Enterprises.\nElixir loaned the Urbans $175,000 for a mortgage at 12434 South Elizabeth Street in Calumet Park and $125,000 for a mortgage at 10504 South LaSalle Street in Chicago. Valencia said those payments stopped in February along with the others.\nIn another lawsuit filed in July, business loan company OnDeck is trying to recover $87,000 from Urban for a loan that went bad near the end of 2024. Urban took out a $155,000 loan in March 2024, according to the lawsuit, with a one-year repayment period, and began to miss payments in October 2024.\nRenovo foreclosures continue\nAs new lawsuits stack up, the Urbans are still facing foreclosure lawsuits at dozens of properties with loans from Chicago-based Renovo Financial. Renovo pooled those debts into a few trusts and U.S. Bank was appointed as the trustee for the loan package.\nMost of those cases are still being litigated. In several of those lawsuits, the court entered a foreclosure judgment against the Urbans\u2019 properties, in some cases because they didn\u2019t respond and in other cases after they answered the complaint.\nIn a few cases, the Urbans have received judges\u2019 approvals to vacate foreclosure judgments and continue to litigate. In court filings asking to vacate a judgment, the Urbans\u2019 attorney, Jeffrey Dan, noted they were facing more than 60 cases and their lack of answer was \u201cdue to excusable neglect.\u201d\nIn at least two cases, the judge has approved a sheriff\u2019s sale of the properties.\nUrban previously told\nThe Real Deal\nhe planned to sell the properties with Renovo loans to avoid foreclosure. Some of the properties under foreclosure threats have been sold, and at least one lawsuit was dismissed after the property sold, records show.\n",

Last year, Astor paid $10 million for the 1.2-acre site at 315 Northwest 27th Avenue.\nDesigned by Coral Gables-based Hamed Rodriguez Architects, Havana Enclave will have a mix of market-rate studios, one and two-bedroom apartments, a press release states.

The residential portion will account for 194,000 square feet.\nConstruction is estimated to cost $105 million, though that doesn\u2019t include all development costs.

        "content": "Apartment construction in New York City has cratered this year as the housing affordability crisis looms large.\nHousing starts for market-rate units have dropped 67 percent from last year, falling from an average of 7,500 per quarter since 2021 to 2,500 this year, according to CoStar data. The pipeline of units under construction shrank over the same period from 71,000 to 47,000, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nOne culprit, many developers say, is the\n485x property tax abatement\n, which replaced the expired 421a program. While both programs were designed to spur affordable housing development, landlords argue the replacement\npiles on labor mandates and affordability thresholds that tank returns\n.\n\u201cWhen you increase cost to a developer, they may ultimately decide the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze,\u201d CoStar\u2019s Victor Rodriguez told the Observer.\nConstruction costs were already a barrier, as New York is one of the priciest markets in the world to build. Add soaring land prices, high union wages and elevated interest rates, and the calculus for ground-up development becomes tougher. Many investors are instead buying existing rentals, betting on steady rent growth. That metric stands at 2.7 percent this year, more than double the national average.\nConversions are offering a partial release valve. As of February, more than 8,300 apartments were in the pipeline from office-to-resi projects, led by marquee redevelopments at 5 Times Square and the former Pfizer headquarters on East 42nd Street.\n\nThe city has streamlined approvals for such projects, making them more appealing than costly office repositionings. Still, the numbers pale in comparison to the scale of demand.\nDevelopers and investors remain split on the future of 485x. Lev Kimyagarov, managing principal and co-founder at Development Site Advisors, previously said the law at least \u201cfixes real flaws\u201d in 421a and can work in today\u2019s political climate.\nThe looming mayoral election is another overhang: 40 percent of real estate professionals cited government policy as the biggest hurdle to projects, according to CoStar.\nFor now, the city\u2019s housing supply continues to lag. Apartment inventory grew 6 percent between 2020 and 2024, compared to more than 20 percent in Orlando and Austin.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo has had his fair share of issues across his career as a broker and developer, only to walk away unscathed.\nAt 125 Greenwich, a planned 88-story high-end condo tower in downtown Manhattan, Shvo\u2019s partners\u00a0 bought out his interest when he was indicted on tax evasion in 2016. The development group struggled to sell condos, and one of the project\u2019s lenders stopped funding the project. Construction stalled and lender BH3 Management threatened to foreclose. Eventually, Fortress Investment Group took over the project.\nShvo, who pleaded guilty and resolved his tax issues without a jail sentence, may have been the only original partner to make money in the deal.\nNow, Shvo is the one dealing with BH3, which this time holds the loan on the iconic Raleigh Miami Beach redevelopment project.\nThe drama has been high for months as the project sits in limbo. Last month, the Wall Street Journal published an\narticle\nwith the headline: \u201cA Luxury Real-Estate Builder\u2019s Improbable Comeback Is Starting to Crumble.\u201d\nCan Shvo manage to stay in this deal and pull off another comeback?\nShvo has been in arbitration proceedings with one of his German investors, with Shvo seeking $85 million in fees he alleges he\u2019s owed. A source familiar with the matter said the arbitration proceedings have been resolved. If he secured the $85 million, he could use that cash to help fund his equity position in the Raleigh.\nAs Shvo plots a way to hold onto the stalled luxury condo and hotel development, a rival bidder, Nahla Capital, is working on its plans in the event it takes over the property.\nShvo and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds\npaid $243 million\nfor the 3-acre property at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenues in 2019 with plans for the Rosewood-branded project. The assemblage includes the Richmond and South Seas hotels.\u00a0In 2023, the partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\nfrom BH3, a Fort Lauderdale-based alternative lender led by Dan Lebensohn and Greg Freedman. BH3 has extended the maturity date for the loan, most recently with an extension that expires in October, but could be extended again. Shvo is current on the loan, according to a source.\nHere\u2019s what could happen next:\nNahla Capital\u2019s bid\nThe Raleigh\u2019s ownership hired Newmark earlier this year to market the property to potential bidders. Newmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo are representing the ownership.\nNew York-based Nahla Capital won the bid to purchase the project for about $275 million, as first reported by\nBusiness Insider\nin July. Shvo had the right of first refusal and is trying to match the offer, though a source said his right of first refusal expired.\nNahla is a private equity firm with $2 billion in assets under management, led by Genghis Hadi. The firm has experience in the same arena as the Raleigh project: It recently completed The Rosewood Residences Beverly Hills.\n\nNahla would take over construction of the Raleigh project, which has not gone vertical, though site work has been completed.\nNahla is moving toward signing a contract, sources said. The company is reportedly working to assemble a team in Miami Beach, if Shvo loses the property. Nahla would likely keep the current plans for a Rosewood-branded condo and hotel in place. (Shvo hired Peter Marino and Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design to design the Raleigh.)\nNahla did not respond to requests for comment.\nShvo\u2019s plan\nThe Shvo-led partnership has gutted the original buildings, which include the historic Art Deco Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels, and planned a new 17-story luxury condo tower on the beachfront site. But vertical construction has stalled.\nTo hold onto control of the Raleigh, Shvo would have to raise new money to pay off his partners, and likely secure new debt, Business Insider reported. Shvo did not respond to requests for comment.\nShvo has missed the peak of the cycle in what\u2019s one of the hottest markets in the country. The developer tapped Oren and Tal Alexander\u2019s now-defunct brokerage, Official, to lead sales of the project in 2023. The following year, the brothers were accused of drugging and raping women. Official lost its new development business. The brothers, who deny the allegations, are in jail awaiting their sex trafficking trial in January.\nOfficial\u2019s invitation-only strategy focused on Rosewood VIPs and friends of Marino and Shvo. All buyers had to be\ninterviewed and approved\nby Shvo. The strategy backfired, industry insiders said.\nLast summer, Anna Sherrill of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty took over presales.\nPresales at the Raleigh have continued to lag behind its competitors. The Raleigh\u2019s closest competition is Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge Resorts-branded Shore Club luxury condo and hotel project, at 1901 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. It\u2019s nearly fully presold, sources said. A penthouse at the Shore Club is reportedly under contract to sell for over $120 million, or more than $11,000 per square foot.\nShvo has contracts signed for nine of the 44 luxury condos planned at The Raleigh, according to a source. The Wall Street Journal reported the highest known price for a unit in contract is nearly $8,500 per square foot or more than $50 million, but most presales are in the $5,000-plus per square foot range.\nMeanwhile, Shvo has parted with one of his other properties in Miami Beach.\nLast week, he sold his Alton Road assemblage, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective. Sources told\nTRD\nthe property was being marketed for sale with a whisper price equal to the amount of the\n$28.3 million loan\n.\nShvo still owns a portion of the development for his One Soundscape Park office project at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\nKeith Larsen contributed to this story.\n",

Forman Capital is also seeking default interest and fees totaling roughly $220,000.\nThrough a spokesperson, Forman Capital declined to comment. Joseph Pardo, the attorney for the Kodsi entities, said his clients are seeking a quick resolution.\n\u201cThis project is transitioning from a land loan to a construction loan, and this is a timing issue,\u201d Pardo said. \u201cWe are in active negotiations with the lender to resolve this, and we fully expect that it will be resolved promptly.\u201d\n\nThe\nKodsi\nentities, which paid a combined $10.7 million for the assemblage in 2022, are working with the city of Miami to finalize the project\u2019s design and the permitted density, Pardo said.\nLast year, Forman Capital provided the loan to refinance a previous mortgage, records show.\nKodsi and former partner Rafael Pecchio had previously planned a 200-unit apartment building. But Peccio bowed out, and Kodsi changed course with new plans for a condo-hotel with 360 units, including some short-term rentals.\nKodsi is also fighting a separate foreclosure case involving his Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter that is currently under construction. Recently, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Spencer Eig gave the Kodsi entity developing the Miami Worldcenter project roughly two months to pay back more than\n$35 million\nto another lender, New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital.\nIn July,\nMonarch\nfiled a foreclosure complaint tied to the partially built 50-story mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami.

        "content": "Homes sold in an average of 37 days in Chicago this August, faster than nearly every other major city.\nNationally, deals took 60 days on average, a slowdown from last year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nOak Park real estate agent Swati Saxena told the outlet that one of her listings on Ridgeland Avenue went under contract in five days at $652,000, while buyers she represented grabbed a $935,000 Grove Avenue house just as fast. Both closed in August, a month when Chicago tied for the nation\u2019s second-fastest-selling housing market behind Milwaukee, according to Realtor.com. Chicago tied for second-fastest with Buffalo, New York, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Cincinnati.\nIn Chicago, sales were only a day slower than August 2024, signaling resilience even as interest rates and prices kept many markets in check.\nLow supply is the culprit. Illinois had one of the steepest inventory drops in the nation, with Chicago buyers facing less than 40 percent of the listings available in 2019, housing tracker ResiClub reported. That\nshortage\nkeeps demand concentrated on the \u201cgood\u201d listings \u2014 those well-priced, well-located or turnkey \u2014 which in many cases spark bidding wars and premiums over ask.\n\nIn La Grange, Coldwell Banker\u2019s Judy Ellison and Teresa Fox sold a 1920s Stone Avenue house for nearly 15 percent over list in mid-August after it found a buyer in two days. In Lakeview, Compass agent Tony Mattar priced a condo low to draw multiple offers and sold it in a week for 2.6 percent over ask. And in Avondale, Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Patrick Hinton watched at least a dozen households flood an open house before his condo listing landed a buyer six days later, closing above ask.\nThe \u201ccircular problem,\u201d Ellison said, is that many owners won\u2019t sell without knowing where they\u2019ll go next. That keeps fresh supply from hitting the market, which in turn fuels even more aggressive buyer behavior. For renters feeling squeezed, the urgency is amplified. In the West Loop, Compass agent Quentin Green\u2019s clients jumped on a $910,000\ncondo\nwith a rooftop deck in five days, citing ballooning rents.\nAs fast as these\ntransactions\nare, there is still room for fallout. Chicago had 16 percent of pending home purchase agreements fall through in July, up from about 15 percent a year prior, according to Redfin. Contract cancellations were similarly high in July 2023, when 16 percent of pending deals fell through.\nNot every property flies \u2014 overpriced or less appealing\nhomes\ncan linger \u2014 but for listings under $1 million in hot neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, speed is the rule. As one broker put it, if it doesn\u2019t sell in a week, something\u2019s wrong.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal would be for about 47,000 square feet in the six-story building.\nPIMCO Prime Real Estate, formerly Allianz Real Estate, owns the building. The Munich, Germany-based PIMCO subsidiary bought a 45 percent stake in the property from Columbia Property Trust in 2020 for $180 million. It went on to grab another 45 percent stake after\nPIMCO acquired Columbia\nin late 2021. PIMCO-owned Columbia is still responsible for managing the building.\nAffirm was founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and set up shop at 650 California Street in Chinatown, also owned by Columbia, in 2017. At that time, the company signed an eight-year lease for 86,000 square feet across four floors in the building. The firm seemingly extended its lease at some point as it has one more year left on its lease, according to the Business Times.\n\nIf the deal closes, Affirm\u2019s headquarters would be smaller than its space at 650 California, though the company has subleased some of its space there to other tenants in recent years. The fintech firm reported impairment charges of $1.2 million in 2023 and $800,000 last year for subleasing out portions of its offices.\nAside from Affirm, software company\nDocuSign\nand financial services company Prosper Marketplace also have offices at 221 Main Street. Late last year, math-focused high school\nProof School\nleased about 35,000 square feet on the first and second floors of the building. JLL, working with Columbia to lease the building, is searching for a tenant or tenants to lease approximately 123,000 square feet in the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The plans also call for The Hangar, a 12,000-square-foot aviation-themed event venue, along with rooftop patios, restaurants, public plazas, and a Texas-style beer garden.\nThe development will connect directly to Addison Circle Park and the Cotton Belt Trail Corridor, part of the region\u2019s 57-mile hike-and-bike system.\nAddison is chipping in $40 million for infrastructure and two parking garages, while Quadrant is expected to put up more than $200 million in private capital. City leaders project the development will support more than 1,600 permanent jobs and generate over $300 million in annual economic output once built. Construction is slated for 2026, though no tenants have been signed for the office space, and the hotel operator is still under negotiation.\n\nThe project is years in the making.\nAddison\nbegan acquiring land along the rail line in the 1980s, anticipating future transit-oriented development. In 2019, the city adopted a special area plan to guide growth around the Silver Line station.\nThe deal with Quadrant\nreplaced\na $472 million plan with Stream Realty Partners and Amli Residential that included housing. Changing market conditions and a shift in partners redirected the vision toward a commercial and entertainment-heavy mix.\nThe development will plug directly into the 26-mile Silver Line,\nlinking\nPlano, Richardson, Carrollton, Cypress Waters, Dallas and DFW International Airport.

        "content": "SRS Real Estate Partners is riding the profitable wave of retail real estate with the hire of Ryan Byrne.\nByrne, who previously spent 10 years as a partner at Byrne Company, is joining the Dallas-based firm as its leader of retail investments for the south central region, which includes Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\nThe death knell of retail has been foretold plenty of times in the last two decades, but the asset class has emerged stronger after its last existential threat, the pandemic. It\u2019s even\nweathering the closure of big box stores\nlike\nForever 21\nand\nParty City\nwith relative ease.\nThe retail market in Dallas-Fort Worth is healthy, with a vacancy rate of 4.8 percent at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from a year before, according to Partners Real Estate. Average asking rents are up from last year, too, rising from $19.78 per square foot to $20.28.\nThe Real Deal chatted with Byrne about his new role and why retail \u201cis not going anywhere.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s in your wheelhouse in terms of price range?\nIt\u2019s going to be a mix of private, institutional, family office type groups. Five-tenant and above, and roughly $10 million in value.\nGrocery-anchored retail is all the rage. Is that the ideal property for your clients?\nNot necessarily. Grocery-anchored is a really attractive space, but we do power centers. We do some of these lifestyle centers, where it could be a $30 million deal, but we\u2019re in a $250,000 average income market with high home values. Some of those deals might not have a main anchor, but it\u2019s going to be high-end shops and high-end restaurants.\nHow have these types of assets been performing lately?\n\nWe\u2019ve been lucky in the retail space. We had Covid, which caused some problems with some of these shopping centers. We had the Amazon effect that came in. We even had higher interest rates. Retailers weathered the storm on every single one of these.\nPeople have realized that retail is not going anywhere. Americans, just by habit, we like to go and shop. We like to go to restaurants. We like to walk in a store. We like to be social and be around people.\nHow long are investors typically looking to hold these kinds of assets?\nIt really can be all of the above. There are some groups that are going to be short-term value-add buyers that are going to buy and try and push rents, redevelop it, backfill some vacant space and then go sell it pretty quickly. There\u2019s a developer side that\u2019s going to buy the land, go lease up the whole center and sell it off. And then you\u2019ve got a mix of other buyers that will do a five-to-seven year hold, depending on hitting return. And there\u2019ll be other groups that are saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a long term holder. I\u2019m a high net worth group. I\u2019m gonna go hold it, I just want cashflow longterm.\u201d\nWith the closure of big-box stores like Party City and Tuesday Morning, what are you seeing owners do with these big vacant spaces?\nPeople used to get scared of the big box space, but everyone\u2019s realizing\nthey\u2019re getting backfilled quickly\n. Every time something happens, there always tends to be another tenant coming in, and there always tends to be almost a higher and better use that gives opportunity and value to the center. It can be reinvented. You can get a new tenant that changes the model. But there\u2019s always new tenants, especially in Texas, which is one of the strongest markets. Every tenant in the country wants to be here\nWho\u2019s doing that these days? Experiential tenants?\nFitness companies\n?\nIt all depends on the location, on the type of center, on the market, on the incomes. That\u2019s what\u2019s so great and unique about retail: every center has a life of its own.\nHow are owners getting creative with these properties?\nEveryone kind of has their model of what they\u2019re looking for, but the properties that have a lot of daily traffic with restaurants and a little more life to it, those centers, tend to do pretty well, because you can obviously order food online, but if you want to go see your friends, you\u2019re going to go to dinner, and you\u2019re going to get out. So it brings life at night and at day. And it\u2019s good to have a center that has not only good daytime traffic, but also brings in a crowd at night.\n",

        "content": "La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley\u2019s Verdugo Mountains, is home to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Descanso Gardens. It also contains the 1.3-acre site of a\nbattle over housing\nthat\u2019s become a case study for\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n.\nThe state provision, which allows developers to circumvent local zoning in cities that have not mapped out plans for future housing development, gave Cedar Street Partners the leverage it needed to push a mixed-use development forward.\nAfter a Los Angeles judge ordered the city in March to post a\n$14 million bond\nin order to move forward on an appeal, La Ca\u00f1ada Mayor Mike Davitt said continuing the legal battle against Cedar Street\u2019s proposed five-story apartment-hotel-office project at 600 Foothill Boulevard was \u201cno longer in the best interest of the city.\u201d\nThe development calls for 7,200 square feet of office and roughly 80 dwelling units, of which eight are affordable and 16 are slated for hospitality.\nThe project\u2019s winding its way through city hall, and building plans are expected in six to eight months. The company is also looking to recover $6 million in costs related to the city\u2019s litigation against the project.\nCedar Street managing member Jonathan Curtis sits from an interesting perch as a developer and a former La Canada Flintridge City Councilmember from 2013 to 2024, even serving as its mayor for a one-year term. He sat down with\nThe Real Deal\nfor a conversation on the push and pull of housing development.\nHas the increased use of builder\u2019s remedy prompted any shift in attitudes about housing developments among communities that have pushed back?\nBuilder\u2019s remedy has definitely moved the needle. A number of jurisdictions realized that the games they\u2019ve played in the past to prevent housing will not work in the future. They\u2019ve come to realize that they need to do legitimate housing elements [required by the state].\nThe HCD, the Housing and Community Development Department of the state of California, reviews [housing elements] and is keeping closer tabs on what cities are doing as far as implementations. So, yes, I do think there\u2019s a shift in cities.\nAt the same time, if you were to contact various lawyers around town, you will find that they have more builder\u2019s remedy cases than they know what to do with. It\u2019s just certain cities that are bad actors, so to speak.\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed budget trailer bills in June paving the way for additional\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act review exemptions\n. Similar bills have been proposed in the past. Why did they get so far this time?\nA fundamental change of attitude toward realizing that the lack of housing is affecting the economy. It affects health. It affects all sorts of things. It\u2019s a realization that we need to do something about housing. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, there\u2019s more of an acceptability of multifamily. It\u2019s a change in attitude. Everybody realizes it is affecting California significantly on many different fronts, and it costs more to deal with homelessness than it would if you dealt with it in a logical way.\nCEQA and other environmental laws are not being thrown out. They\u2019re being reined in to what they should have been for a long time.\nWhat might this shift in attitudes and policy changes mean for\nrebuilding\nplaces such as the Palisades and Altadena?\nThose exemptions under CEQA are for the entitlements to get a permit, but you still have building plans that have to be done.\nSo you\u2019ve got the permitting time. You\u2019ve got construction and construction inspections.\nRebuilding\u2019s got to be done on a holistic basis, because you could get your entitlements, or even if you\u2019re in the [Coastal Commission] zone, you could still sit there and wait a year for building plans. There\u2019s been efforts by the state, the county and the city to set up separate programs for rebuilding. The challenge on some of the rebuilding is you have a limitation as far as how much more you can build [back]. You can change a little bit, but you can\u2019t change it too much. What you\u2019re losing there is other [development] opportunities.\nDoes Cedar Street have interest in going into any of the communities impacted by the fires for possible development?\nWe would probably prefer doing mixed use as opposed to pure retail. I think retail can be a tough one, at least in Altadena, just because you need the critical mass. But which one comes first? It\u2019s really hard to tell.\nWhat other challenges face the development community right now?\nTariffs. But we don\u2019t know where tariffs are going to go because they keep changing.\nThere\u2019s also financing with the higher interest rates, it\u2019s more difficult, both on the construction financing as well as permanent financing. There\u2019s talk of two rate cuts, so that could potentially help things.\nWe also still face the attitude a lot of cities have, despite what the laws are, in pushing back [against development].\n",

        "content": "Colliers International Group is doubling down on multifamily and planting deeper roots in Texas with its latest acquisition.\nThe global brokerage\nacquired\nDallas-based Greystone Sales Group, also known as GREA Dallas, a 25-person multifamily investment sales team led by Todd Franks, Bisnow\nreported\n. The firm represents private and institutional investors across the country. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe move is part of a mergers and acquisitions binge that helped Colliers post a strong second quarter. The company snapped up Canadian engineering firm Higher Ground Consulting and Chicago-based Terra Consulting Group this spring, with acquisitions contributing $436 million in revenue \u2014 a 67 percent jump from last year.\nGreystone gives Colliers more firepower in the multifamily space where Dallas-Fort Worth is one of the\nbusiest\nmarkets in the country, said Gil Borok, Colliers U.S. president and CEO. Borok cited strong economic fundamentals, population growth and investment activity as top reasons Colliers is focused on North Texas as part of its national multifamily capital markets strategy.\n\nThe Metroplex had nearly 47,000 units under construction halfway through the year and another 18,000 scheduled for delivery by mid-2026, according to Colliers. That pipeline ranks DFW second nationally behind only New York City, according to RentCafe. With the region on track to surpass Chicago as the nation\u2019s third-largest metro area by 2030 \u2014 more than 450 new residents arrive daily, according to the U.S. Census Bureau \u2014 the appetite for more\nmultifamily\nunits has been steady, even with higher borrowing costs.\nThe acquisition demonstrates how population gains in North Texas are bolstering more than just apartments. Retail leasing has rebounded, hotel development is picking up, and even the sluggish office market has seen stabilizing demand. For Colliers, the Dallas foothold is as much about\ncapturing\nfuture growth as it is about immediate deal flow.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the Greystone team will relocate from its 5728 LBJ Freeway office to Colliers\u2019 Uptown Dallas home at the 17Seventeen tower on McKinney Avenue. Either way, the brokerage now has another flag planted in a hot multifamily battleground.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Morgan Wealth Management \u2014 snagged a six-bedroom townhouse at\n171 East 73rd Street\nfor $12.1 million. The seller was an LLC tied to\nOwen Tunney\n, an investment professional, and\nJennifer Frame-Tunney\n, a managing director at BlackRock, that paid $6.4 million for the home in 2012. The five-story home has four outdoor spaces, heated sidewalks, a gym and elevator. The property\u2019s most recent asking price was $13.5 million.

An affiliate of\nPamera North America\npicked up a nine-story building at\n640 Broadway\nfor $49.5 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAcadia Realty Trust\n, which bought the property, also known as\n172 Crosby Street\n, in 2012 for $32.5 million via a joint venture with Winhaven Group. The building\u2019s retail space spans just over 11,000 square feet, and the residential portion, with 21 units, covers about 42,000 square feet. Acadia once planned to convert the property into a\nresidential condominium\n. JLL\u2019s\nSteven Rutman\nand\nJeffrey Julien\nhad the\nlisting\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Washington Heights, a stalled construction site at\n4452 Broadway\nand an adjacent lot at\n44 Fairview Avenue\nsold for $15.3 million. The seller was\nMadison Realty Capital\n, which took over the sites in 2024 through a bankruptcy sale from HAP Investments for $26.5 million. The latest transaction marks a 42 percent drop from its previous trade price. The newest owner is a Clifton, New Jersey-based LLC tied to\nThree Pillars\n. HAP had planned to build a 129-unit, seven-story apartment complex at the site, but the project remains unfinished.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nThe\nCatholic Near East Welfare Association\nshed a church property at\n248 East 62nd Street\nin Lenox Hill for $9.7 million.

The Soles purchased the Greenwich Village home in 2011 for $5.7 million. The property dates to 1844 and has some 4,300 square feet of living space, which includes five bedrooms and a chef\u2019s kitchen.

        "content": "What do Comptroller Brad Lander and President Donald Trump have in common?\nI\u2019m sure if I asked Lander, whom I have known since he ran the nonprofit Fifth Avenue Committee in Park Slope from 1993 to 2003, he would say, \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d\nBut there is one thing, actually: Both proposed declaring a housing emergency so they could take steps not otherwise possible to improve affordability.\nLander did so during his Democratic primary campaign for mayor, in which he finished third behind Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo. Then Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, said early this month that the administration\nmight declare a housing emergency\nthis fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out what we can do, and we don\u2019t want to step into the business of states, counties and municipal governments,\u201d Bessent said.\nThat\u2019s an unfortunate caveat. Without fixing local zoning, regulation and sludge that drives up housing prices, a Trump emergency declaration would produce little besides a day\u2019s worth of headlines.\n\u201cOverriding, or at least standardizing, local laws on zoning would be a great step toward allowing builders to deliver the inventory needed by the American people,\u201d Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner told Newsweek.\nLander\u2019s emergency would have helped him \u201ctake certain executive actions to, for example, increase funding for housing-focused agencies and eliminate time-consuming budget office reviews of certain affordable housing deals,\u201d the New York Times\nreported\n.\nHe also proposed letting certain projects\nskip Ulurp\n, the public review process that takes five to seven months, and instead go through a 90-day review. But he would have first formed a committee to decide what kind of projects would qualify. Lander\u2019s preamble would surely have taken many months.\nNeedless to say, Lander doesn\u2019t want Trump to declare a housing emergency because he doubts Trump would put any new powers to good use. In a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, Lander said Trump\u2019s policies so far have been bad for housing.\n\u201cHis erratic tariff policies and cruel mass deportation regime are driving up the costs of building new homes,\u201d Lander said. \u201cHe\u2019s cut housing subsidies and proposed to eliminate far more. He\u2019s declared war on America\u2019s cities and deprived them of funds. And Project 2025 calls for opposing any efforts to weaken single-family zoning, the biggest single impediment to denser housing construction.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nGoldman Copeland principal Daniel Colombini engineered his\nown home\u2019s construction\nin Westchester County, spending $300 per square foot, or 8 percent more than traditional construction would have cost, to achieve passive house standards \u2014 a cost that energy savings will make up in 10 to 15 years. But he says the indoor air quality has already cured his allergy-induced asthma. Do you plan to build or buy a passive house? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Home refinancing is coming back as interest rates decline along with the number of homes that still have pre-2022, low-rate mortgages. Over the past year, about 42 percent of home loans were refis. Last week, 49 percent were, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A new Public Policy Polling survey shared with\nCity &amp; State\nshows Zohran Mamdani leading the New York City mayoral race with 39 percent of the vote, ahead of Andrew Cuomo at 25 percent. That lead is smaller than other recent polls, like a recent Times/Siena poll that found Mamdani at 46 percent.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s decision to scale back New York\u2019s Essential Plan could cut off free government health insurance for about 450,000 New Yorkers,\nGothamist\nreported. It would reverse last year\u2019s expansion that raised the income eligibility limit for the Essential Plan to 250 percent of the federal poverty level (the limit had been 200 percent). Hochul blamed the rollback on federal funding cuts, saying that the move will allow for emergency funds to safeguard coverage for most of the 1.7 million current enrollees.\n\u2014 The Adams administration is advancing a plan for Related Companies to keep operating Central Park\u2019s Wollman Rink, sidelining the Trump Organization\u2019s bid to retake the concession, according to\nThe City\n. The Parks Department has sent Related\u2019s bid to the city Department of Investigation for a required background check.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$12.1 million\nfor a 7,100-square-foot townhouse at 171 East 73rd Street on the Upper East Side. Chase Landow of Serhant had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$49.5 million\nfor a 53,439-square-foot, nine-story, mixed-use property at 640 Broadway in Noho. Acadia Realty sold the building to German investor Pamera North America.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21.5 million\nfor a 6,000-square-foot co-op unit at 895 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "\u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing,\u201d said Chris Tourtellote, managing director at Marina Del Rey-based LaTerra Development, on developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles.\nThat sums up the seeming political impetus for a\nstate bill\nthat is eligible for a floor vote today after 11 p.m., which could relax the transfer taxes as outlined in United to House LA measure, aka Measure ULA.\n\u201cYou build for $100 million, sell it for $105 million and pay $5.5 million in taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax should be on your profit, not on your sale price. It makes it tough in a city that already has high development impact fees and affordability requirements, and even construction costs are higher and interest rates are higher.\u201d\nIn order to side step hefty tax bills\u00a0 via Measure ULA after building and then selling a new development, LaTerra is pursuing development in cities in California and elsewhere that are not subject to the \u201cmansion tax.\u201d\nThe firm is looking in Burbank \u2014 where LaTerra opened a 573-unit project in Burbank on Aug. 1 \u2014 as well as in San Diego, Orange County and Riverside because the mansion tax is not in effect there, Tourtellote said.\nSean Burton, CEO of Cityview, headquartered in Los Angeles, said his firm is actively developing around the country.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been focused on L.A. because of ULA,\u201d he said.\nThe one exception is a project that has been in the works since 2021: Cityview\u2019s 489-unit 6136 West Manchester Avenue, which received\nCity Council approval\nin May. The eight-story, 489-unit project is expected to break ground in 2026 and be complete in late 2028.\n\u201cCalifornia obviously already has a housing crisis,\u201d Burton said. \u201cLos Angeles has a housing crisis, and this tax is exacerbating it.\u201d\nDevelopment in L.A. only works if you have a good land basis, can build above-grade parking and can capture high rents, according to Tourtellote.\nLaTerra has two projects that fit that bill \u2014 4112 Del Rey Avenue in Marina Del Rey and 2311 North Hollywood Way in Burbank.\nLess building\nMeasure ULA was approved by L.A. voters in 2022 and went into effect in the city in April 2023 to fund homeless initiatives. It imposes a 4 percent tax on property sales over $5 million, and 5.5 percent on those above $10 million.\n\u201cThe idea was not to significantly reduce market-rate and affordable housing production,\u201d Tourtellote said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what anybody wants, right? But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nSo far this year, the City of Los Angeles issued fewer permits for new apartment buildings with\nfive\nor more units year-over-year, dropping from 157 developments with 7,609 units in 2023 to 122 buildings comprising 5,156 units in 2024 to 90 buildings with 3,704 units through Aug. 31, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof new building permits issued by the city for the last five years.\nMeasure ULA is a \u201cmajor factor\u201d contributing to the slowdown in permits, Drachman said. \u201cIt has driven up the cost of building anything since the tax is so punitive given it\u2019s a tax on a transfer, not profits.\u201d\nThat slowdown is colliding with the city\u2019s already daunting housing mandate to plan for the construction of 456,643 new housing units between 2021 and 2029.\n\nPaul Schon, founder of Hollywood-based Schon Development Group (formerly Schon Tepler), said his firm is not developing because it\u2019s \u201cso expensive\u201d between construction costs, high interest rates and Measure ULA.\nInstead, the firm is building accessory dwelling units on firm-owned properties and acquiring value-add, multifamily properties like the 21-unit Mar Vista Lofts at 3992 Inglewood Boulevard in Mar Vista it nabbed for $9 million in December.\n\u201cInterest rates put a shock to the environment across the nation \u2026 but then what really hammered it down was the mansion tax for the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Schon said.\nFor the tides to turn, Schon said it would take massive rent hikes or a significant drop in interest rates. The Federal Reserve first hiked interest rates in March 2022 in response to rising inflation.\nWhat\u2019s old is new\nLaTerra Development is also acquiring existing apartment buildings.\n\u201cRight now you can buy new apartment buildings for less than it costs to build,\u201d Tourtellote said.\nWaterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman shared a similar sentiment about Measure ULA\u2019s impact.\n\u201cSpecifically for the City of Los Angeles it makes absolutely no sense to be building projects when it\u2019s a lot cheaper to buy existing projects,\u201d said Drachman, co-founder of the Newport Beach-based multifamily development firm. \u201cIf you look at recent trades in places around the city, newer projects are selling for far cheaper than what it would cost to replace.\u201d\nGovernment hand\nAt the state level,\nchanges\nwere made in July to the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA \u2014 enacted in 1970 to balance environmental protection and development but believed to be an effective tool at slowing or stopping development. The changes essentially cut red tape for many multifamily and single-family housing developments.\nThat alone is not the complete solution to the housing crisis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about CEQA,\u201d Tourtellote said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, but if the deal doesn\u2019t work and you can\u2019t find the investors, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\nSome significant changes to Measure ULA could be on the way.\nA bill published late Tuesday and slated for a vote by the State Assembly and State Senate Friday night calls for the reduction of the transfer tax on new multifamily, commercial and industrial construction to 1.5 percent for the first 15 years. It also exempts the rebuilding of single-family homes destroyed in natural disasters from the transfer tax for five years.\n\u201cIt would really help spur investment in new projects,\u201d Burton said of the legislation co-authored by Sen. Lena Gonzalez and Assembly member Tina McKinnon.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019 infamous \u201cTrash House,\u201d previously freed of debris and detritus, is once again covered in garbage.\nA year after residents in the Fairfax District complained about piles of trash at a home on Martel Avenue, it has once again started to pile up at the so-called \u201cTrash House,\u201d KTLA\nreported\n. The brown, Spanish-style stucco home at 617 North Martel Avenue has been a lightning rod of criticism from neighbors for more than a year.\nIt started in April of last year when neighbors first complained about smelly plastic bags that had been piling up in front of the home for months.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in that, so it could be anything,\u201d one resident told KTLA at the time. \u201cProbably stuff rotting, attracting rats and all sorts of things\u2026 And if something happens to his house or him inside, no one can get in.\u201d\nThe home is occupied by 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran Raymond Gaon. While some neighbors have described him as a \u201cnice man,\u201d the issue of compiling trash had been brewing for years. After the property gained notable attention last year, his sister explained that Gaon is autistic and makes his money by recycling.\nAt the time, the property attracted the attention of local Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky, Mayor Karen Bass and even a producer of the TV series \u201cHoarders,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Sanitation workers cleaned up the property and found a variety of objects underneath the rubble, including a Toyota car.\n\u201cThis is a fire hazard, and I worry about the individual there, this place catching fire, him losing his life,\u201d Bass said last year. \u201cThis is just outrageous, and it will end today.\u201d\n\nNow, with trash piling up at the home once again, Yaroslavsky has taken notice, issuing a statement yesterday about the growing problem.\n\u201cNeighbors have lived with a health and safety hazard for far too long and it is completely unacceptable. Our office has pushed [the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety], the City Attorney, and the County for more than a year, flagged every complaint from neighbors, and demanded updates on every court hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis case shows how slow and fragmented the system is.\u201d\nSome neighbors and friends have come to Gaon\u2019s defense, however.\n\u201cIf he was homeless, nobody would be pointing a camera in his face and trying to record him or his living situation,\u201d Paul Wilson, a neighbor who lives across the street, told the L.A. Times.\nThe mess is organized chaos for his recycling business, according to Tonya Lee Jaymes, a friend of Gaon\u2019s who helps people with hoarding problems.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a one-man operation, and this is how he makes his money,\u201d Jaynes said. \u201cHe\u2019s not bothering.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The last record holder,\n1800 The Strand\n, was sold last July and has claimed the record title each of the three times it has gone on the market.\nBefore 1800 The Strand, the last record for Manhattan Beach was 1000 The Strand, a corner-lot property that sold in 2017 for $21 million.\nHomes in Manhattan Beach traded for a median price of $3.1 million in July, according to Redfin data.

        "content": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker is putting a price tag on the Chicago Bears\u2019 suburban ambitions: more than half a billion dollars in debt tied to Soldier Field renovations.\nThe governor said this week that before lawmakers consider the property tax break the team is\nseeking\nfor its Arlington Heights stadium plan, the Bears will need to deal with the $534 million still owed on Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe need the Bears to pay off what\u2019s owed on the existing stadium,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIf they want a PILOT [payment-in-lieu-of-taxes] bill, or some other help, we\u2019re going to make that a prerequisite.\u201d\nThe team has been\nlobbying\nSpringfield for a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes law that would let megaproject developers negotiate fixed annual payments instead of facing regular property tax assessments. The proposal would apply statewide but is central to the Bears\u2019 $5 billion vision for Arlington Heights, where Kevin Warren, president of the team\u2019s organization, has said they hope to start construction this year. Without legislation, the project is stalled, Warren said.\nThe debt complicates things. Soldier Field\u2019s bonds are backed by a hotel tax and annual city and state subsidies, with shortfalls covered by Chicago\u2019s share of state tax revenue. Even if the Bears leave, they aren\u2019t directly tied to repayment. But as debt service ramps up over the next decade, the cost of walking away without a plan would land on taxpayers \u2014 a sticking point for legislators already wary of another stadium bailout.\nThe Bears\u2019 lease with the Park District runs through 2033, but the team has signaled it could try to exit earlier, citing frustration over maintenance. Terminating the lease would require a fee, which shrinks each year, but it wouldn\u2019t come close to erasing Soldier Field\u2019s debt.\n\nPritzker has\nopposed\nusing state dollars to fund stadium construction in the past, though he\u2019s left the door\nopen\nto infrastructure support. He\u2019s also made clear his preference for keeping the Bears in the city, but stopped short of tying state assistance to location.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a private business. They can go wherever they would like to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would like them to stay in the city of Chicago.\u201d\nLawmakers, meanwhile, aren\u2019t convinced. State Rep. Kam Buckner said the governor\u2019s stance reflects growing pressure to make the Bears address \u201cunfinished business\u201d before Springfield helps them move.\n\u201cLeaving the city high and dry without having a way to address that debt is the wrong thing to do,\u201d Buckner said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

New York-based Westbrook Partners was the seller.\nThe deal for the 123,577-square-feet structure works out to $159.41 per square foot. Westbrook Partners bought Stadium Centre from Guggenheim Services, another New York-based firm, in 2018 for $28.8 million, or $233.05 per square foot, according to the Business Journal.\nThe property rises six stories at 2099 South State College Boulevard near Angel Stadium. Tenants at the building include Anaheim Visitors Bureau and Rexel USA, according to the Business Journal. The structure was built in 1985 and is located in Anaheim\u2019s Platinum Triangle mixed-use district, which features residences, restaurants and retail near the Angels\u2019 ballpark.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest office building near Angel Stadium to trade hands in recent months.\nIn June, Henry and Susan Samueli, owners of the Anaheim Ducks, bought the Stadium Tower office building next to the team\u2019s home rink at the\nHonda Center\n. CBRE Investment Management and CalSTRS sold the 261,939-square-foot property at 2400 East Katella Avenue for $72.1 million, or about $275 per square foot. CBRE and CalSTRS previously bought the tower in 2017 for $63.9 million.\nThat acquisition is purportedly part of the Samuelis\u2019 ongoing expansion plan in the area around the two sports venues known as OCVibe. The megadevelopment, projected to cost $4 billion, calls for 100 acres of multifamily buildings, two hotels, a 50,000-square-foot food hall, two live event venues and office and retail spaces, according to\nForbes\n.\nIn addition to commercial properties such as the Stadium Centre office building, San Francisco-based Baco holds retail, self-storage and single-family properties in its\nportfolio\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The population of Leander grew by 7,000 people, representing a 9 percent increase and outpacing second-place Georgetown by 2,400 people. Austin grew by 4,000 people, or 0.4 percent, as the city\u2019s Big Tech-propelled growth of\na few years ago\nhas flagged.\n\nPound for pound, the fastest-growing city in the Austin area was the southwestern town of Dripping Springs, where an increase of 1,500 people grew the population by 17 percent.\nSome agents are calling Austin a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, especially certain submarkets such as\ncondos\nand luxury homes. Selling a home appears to be easier in the suburbs, however.\n\u201cThe whole market is going through a kind of right-sizing, if you will,\u201d Havel said.\nTri Pointe\u2019s planned developments, named Ridgeview Reserve and Noven, will comprise one- and two-story homes of 3,500 to 4,400 square feet of space on 70-foot lots. Ridgeview Reserve, expected to accommodate 42 homes, will go up next to Rouse High School at Raider Way and Woodview Drive, roads the city recently finished improving with crosswalks and bike lanes. Noven, expected to include 108 homes, is less than 3 miles away on County Road 177.\n",

        "content": "Fort Lauderdale is attempting to find a developer for its new city hall, two years after the former government center was damaged in a flood from a historic rainstorm.\nSix groups filed proposals to build a new city hall at 100 North Andrews Avenue, with some of the applications proffering two or more alternative designs.\nThe previous eight-story, Brutalist-style gray concrete building with a fortress-like appearance was completed in 1969.\nIn 2023, record rainfall led to floods in\nFort Lauderdale\n, with water pouring into the former city hall building\u2019s basement. The building was demolished in November and staff has been working in leased space elsewhere.\nIn May, Meridiam Infrastructure North America, the builder of the\nPortMiami Tunnel\nand an affiliate of Paris-based global investment and asset manager Meridiam, filed an unsolicited proposal to partner with the city on a new city hall. Under a state law requirement, the city opened the opportunity for other developers to submit competing applications by Aug. 5.\nHere is an inside look at what each group proposes:\nBalfour\u2019s three options\nMalvern, Pennsylvania-based Balfour Beatty, a global infrastructure firm, offered three options designed by\nKobi Karp\nand DLR Group. Costs for the proposals aren\u2019t listed.\nThe first option is a 250,000-square-foot city hall with a library and a small commercial space. The second option adds additional floors for lease to retailers and office users other than the city. And the third option is a large campus consisting of one of the first two options plus another building with residential or commercial uses, the filing shows.\nThe proposal shows a target completion date of mid-2028.\nMeridiam\u2019s three options\nMeridiam outlines three Zyscovich-designed options.\nThe firm\u2019s largest proposal is for a 12-story, 340,000-square-foot building with a podium of up to three stories with services such as child care, a wellness center and a gallery.\nAlternatively, Meridiam also outlines a baseline proposal for a seven-story, 200,000-square-foot city hall with a two-story podium with \u201climited shared spaces,\u201d the filing shows.\nThe middle ground option is for a 10-story, 275,000-square-foot building with a podium of up to three stories. Under this proposal, the commission chambers and the common areas will be smaller than in the firm\u2019s largest city hall option, the filing shows.\nThe estimated project capital expenditures will range from $172 million to $292 million, according to the proposal.\nCompletion of the commission chambers is expected in late 2028, with the full project buildout expected in 2029.\nFort Lauderdale Civic Hall Partnership\n\nA consortium of firms that includes Melbourne, Australia-based Plenary Group as the project developer and lead equity partner, proposes an oval-shaped, 10-story city hall.\nDesigned by Palma and PGAL architecture firms, the building would span 196,000 square feet, according to the proposal.\nCompletion would be in late 2028. The project is estimated to cost $280 million.\nFort Lauderdale Beacon Collaborative\nGilbane Development Company proposes an\nArquitectonica\n-designed building, with its most notable feature a wave-like awning.\nProvidence, Rhode Island-based Gilbane wants to build a 229-foot tall building, with its proposal emphasizing hurricane-proof windows, energy efficiency and public spaces. The expected completion is in 2027.\nV. Industry Grade Construction Group\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t identify an architect or list the project\u2019s height or square footage. It lists an expected completion in 2028 and a fully private financing structure that will require no upfront city expenditure.\nVI. Cypress West\nCypress West, an entity led by Sheldon Gross of Hillsboro Beach, proposes a new government center with two campuses.\nThe city\u2019s back office operations would be at a North Operations Campus at 1515 West Cypress Creek Road in Fort Lauderdale, a building on which Cypress West has the leasehold and that\u2019s currently used by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. The building is in an X flood zone, which designates areas least exposed to flood risk.\nThe second portion of the campus would be a new, roughly 100,000-square-foot building at 100 North Andrews Avenue. The final design, size and other features would be determined collaboratively with the city.\n\u201cRather than offering a one-size-fits-all financing approach, our development team will work collaboratively with [the city] to explore various financing structures,\u201d the application says.\nThis proposal also projects a 2028 completion.\n",

        "content": "Austin leaders are moving to create a housing fund aimed at preserving existing affordable apartments, a tool they hope can slow the pace of displacement in one of the nation\u2019s hottest housing markets.\nThe Austin City Council is moving to establish a fund that would attract philanthropic contributions to keep naturally occurring affordable housing from being sold off and demolished, KXAN\nreported\n. Council Member Marc Duchen, who proposed the measure, said the effort is meant to counter the unintended consequences of incentive programs like DB 90, which lets developers build taller in exchange for affordable units but can still lead to a net loss of affordability when existing low-rent properties are torn down.\nOne flashpoint has been the Acacia Cliffs complex, where demolition of older affordable units made way for a taller building that technically met DB 90\u2019s requirements but displaced longtime tenants.\nCity officials envision the fund offering property owners grants for repairs in exchange for\naffordability\ncovenants. That model could preserve units without forcing owners to sell to developers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily buying down the rent,\u201d said Eric Johnson, assistant city manager. \u201cIt\u2019s saying to an owner, without disrupting the market, \u2018We have a grant source we could provide to you to do the capital improvements in exchange for a covenant on the property to guarantee affordability.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson previously helped launch a similar fund in Dallas in 2021. That effort began with $6 million in seed funding and has since grown to more than $40 million, with another $60 million in the pipeline, backed by private and banking sector contributions. The Dallas Housing Opportunity Fund has a target of preserving or producing at least 1,500 affordable units by 2031.\nIn Austin, officials expect the money to flow toward three areas: grants for repairs, low-cost financing for new affordable development, and\nservices\nfor residents. But they acknowledge a looming challenge \u2014 competing with private developers who can move faster to acquire aging complexes and redevelop them.\nIt also might be difficult to make the math work for landlords struggling with\nkeeping\nheads in beds. Oversupply of multifamily units has meant higher vacancies. Apartment occupancy dipped to 85 percent in August, with rents sliding 7.5 percent year-over-year to an average of $1,405, according to\nApartmentData.com\n. In 2023, rent\ndipped\n12.5 percent from its 2021-22 highmarks, but many renters still find the city unaffordable.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 25 sales this year are the most recorded for the market since 1999, and are on pace to double last year\u2019s total.\nPruner cited the stock market and uncertainty surrounding\nNew York City\u2019s impending mayoral election\nfor the \u201caccelerating\u201d activity in the market.\nOne of the biggest obstacles holding back home sales across the nation,\nelevated mortgage rates\n, does little to daunt buyers of high-end homes.\nPruner estimated there could be $597 million worth of trophy home sales in Greenwich for the full year. That would shatter the previous record of $314 million, which was set two years ago.\n\nThe market has seen sales this year that exceed $10 million by leaps and bounds. A 27,000-square-foot manor sold for $43.5 million, while a waterfront mansion that is less than half the size of that manor is in contract after asking $43 million.\nThe home at 214 Clapboard Ridge Road sold for more than $43 million last month after originally listing for $55 million. The buyers agreed to the purchase 42 days after the luxury home hit the market.\nMichele Tesei, an agent with Houlihan Lawrence in the area, told Bloomberg inherited wealth appeared to also be playing a role in the market\u2019s increased activity, with multiple couples under 40 visiting the listing at 214 Clapboard Ridge Road.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m dealing with a high-end luxury property, I always advise the seller not to expect a quick sale \u2014 they have to be prepared for the house to be on the market for 200 to 365 days,\u201d said Tesei. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen sales way quicker than that.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A New York City-based real estate attorney is suing celebrity broker Ryan Serhant, alleging he jilted her of her full referral commission in a Fisher Island deal with Stoli Vodka billionaire Yuri Shefler.\nThe attorney, Natalia Sishodia, is demanding $455,000 and a jury trial, court documents show. According to the complaint and an attachment, Sishodia signed a referral agreement with Serhant, whose firm brokered the sale of the Fisher Island home, in April 2024.\nSishodia, who heads her namesake firm in New York City, alleges that Serhant owed her 25 percent of the $840,000 gross commission, which equates to $210,000. She alleges he only paid her $105,000, citing an amended agreement. Her complaint, filed in July in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County, names Serhant and seven of his companies as defendants.\nThe $455,000 accounts for the additional $105,000 Sishodia claims she is owed, as well as $350,000 in damages.\nAttorneys for Sishodia declined to comment. Serhant\u2019s attorney, Andrew Lieb, in an email confirmed the broker is seeking to dismiss the case and \u201cwill let the papers speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe dispute revolves around Shefler\u2019s\n$21 million\npurchase of the home at 6915 Valencia Drive on\nFisher Island\nin Miami Beach in December. Serhant agent Mariana Niro represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal for the 9,400-square-foot mansion, one of just a few single-family homes on the private island.\nShefler\u2019s affiliation to the purchase was revealed in the legal filings and has not been previously reported. The Russian-born vodka magnate has a $1.1 billion net worth, according to Forbes. He heads SPI Group and its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Stoli Group, the maker of the vodka of the same name and several other liquor brands.\nIn 2015, Shefler sold his 440-foot superyacht, Serene, to Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $550 million, the\nNew York Times\nreported. In 2022, he bought Angelina Jolie\u2019s share in the French Ch\u00e2teau Miraval vineyard for $28.4 million, according to published reports. The sale angered her ex-husband and Miraval co-owner Brad Pitt, who is suing Jolie for $67 million over the deal, according to published reports.\nThe sale to Shefler marked a win for\nSerhant\n, who only expanded to South Florida in 2023. His growth efforts have been dogged by legal battles \u2013\u2013 that year, Palm Beach Gardens-based\nSutter &amp; Nugent sued Serhant Florida\n, alleging the brokerage stole trade secrets. That suit was\ndismissed\nin April.\nSince then, he landed top Palm Beach agent Gary Pohrer and\nopened an office on the island\n. He\u2019s also orchestrating the purchase of\na $350 million-plus oceanfront assemblage\nin Palm Beach linked to Microsoft billionaire Charles Simonyi.",

The building would span 148,000 square feet alongside Fifth Avenue.\nThe property would be significantly larger than the one LVMH is in the process of razing, which stood 20 stories tall and spanned a comparatively meager 91,000 square feet.\nThe upgraded 485-foot-tall property would feature a 10-story flagship retail store, a \u201cworld-class experiential retail destination,\u201d according to the DCP application. There will be a cafe and terrace with Central Park views on the eighth floor and four floors of exposition space perched above, which will have programs about the company\u2019s brand history.\nOther elements of the building would include a luxury spa, showroom suites, restaurants and a top-floor bar and garden.\nLVMH is applying for a floor-area bonus of nearly 25,000 square feet. In exchange, the company would facilitate improvements at the nearby Lexington Avenue-59th Street subway station, including an elevator that meets the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nLVMH did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\nA year ago, the luxury goods retailer filed plans to tear down the existing flagship building. Since then, the 8,100-square-foot lot has been clad with scaffolding from LVMH, adorned with Louis Vuitton\u2019s signature logo print and styled as a stack of trunks.\nLVMH\u2019s plans for the revamping of its flagship store have been in the works for years. The conglomerate was\nreported in 2023 to be interviewing\n\u201cstarchitects\u201d for the job. It\u2019s unclear where it landed on its search, however, as the DCP application doesn\u2019t appear to make any mention of an architect.\nThe firm is reimagining its real estate portfolio on both coasts,\nplanning\nto build a new Tiffany &amp; Co. store on the site of the old Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel in Los Angeles. It also submitted plans for a large Louis Vuitton store and adjacent campus designed by architect Frank Gehry.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That ranking was based on the team\u2019s $940 million in volume across their representation of 76 transaction sides.\nThis year alone, Parnes and Harris were part of a group of agents that pushed the $110 million purchase of\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air across the finish line in May.\n\nCarolwood\u2019s Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, Parnes and Harris represented a limited liability company in the estate\u2019s sale to former Crown Resorts chair James Packer.\nCarolwood\u2019s Drew Fenton and Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport represented Packer in the mega deal that\u2019s now tied with Spelling Manor for priciest sale this year.\nHarris and Parnes, both from London, established Bond Street 13 years ago. They carved out a business of their own in the U.S. when they joined the cast of \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d which they credited in another Instagram post with having \u201cchanged our business and our lives.\u201d The two would go on to grow their real estate business over the course of seven seasons of the show before announcing their exit in 2022 saying at the time \u201cwe feel that as our business has evolved, we need to keep moving.\u201d\nTwo years later, the two parted ways with The Agency after a decade at Mauricio Umansky\u2019s brokerage to join the fast-growing Carolwood Estates in 2024.\n\u201cI love [The Agency founder and CEO] Mauricio [Umansky] and we did incredibly well there,\u201d\nParnes\ntold\nTRD\nlast September of the thinking behind the move. \u201cThe Agency went global. They achieved everything they set out to do and more. They have offices everywhere. For us, we\u2019re focused on the super high end, in our key market \u2014 which is Los Angeles. We find that the Carolwood brand is more aligned with what we are and who we are now because it\u2019s a boutique Beverly Hills office with some of the top agents in the country.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Michael Jordan\u2019s former Highland Park mansion won\u2019t be carved up into million-dollar slices after all.\nHighland Park officials this week amended the city\u2019s zoning ordinance to ban timeshares in single-family homes, effectively killing a plan from self-storage investor John Cooper, who\nbought\nthe 7.4-acre estate at 2700 Point Lane in December for $9.5 million.\nCooper had plans to sell $1 million shares in property \u2014 renamed Champions Point \u2014 giving buyers a deeded interest and a weeklong stay each year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The zoning change, approved this week, plugged any potential loophole that may have allowed that model.\n\u201cIt may be that the issue was brought to our attention because of one particular property,\u201d Steven Elrod, Highland Park\u2019s corporation counsel, told the council before the vote, while stressing the measure applies citywide.\n\nCooper said he was exploring alternatives, including long-term or short-term leases. Those are now in motion: the 37,700-square-foot home, still adorned with Jordan\u2019s No. 23 on the gate, is\nlisted\nfor $89,000 a month or $78,137 for a five-night stay on Airbnb.\nThe nine-bedroom, 19 bathroom home has a full-size indoor basketball court, two salt-water aquariums and a cigar lounge with humidor and custom leather poker tables.\nFractional ownership\n\u2014 which Cooper had pitched as a unique chance to \u201cown a piece of history\u201d \u2014 is distinct from the vacation timeshare model, but that distinction didn\u2019t matter to Highland Park. The council\u2019s amendment allows timeshares only in commercial districts. The city does allow short-term rentals, meaning Cooper can still monetize the estate through leasing.\nJordan built the house in the early 1990s while dominating the NBA, and he lived there until after his 2006 divorce from Juanita Jordan. He listed the mansion in 2012 for $29 million, but it languished on the market for more than a decade before\nselling\nat a steep discount last year.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Forman Capital is also seeking default interest and fees totaling roughly $220,000.\nThrough a spokesperson, Forman Capital declined to comment. Pardo, the attorney for the borrowers, said his clients are seeking a quick resolution.\n\n\u201cThis project is transitioning from a land loan to a construction loan, and this is a timing issue,\u201d Pardo said. \u201cWe are in active negotiations with the lender to resolve this, and we fully expect that it will be resolved promptly.\u201d\nThe entities, which paid a combined $10.7 million for the assemblage in 2022, are working with the city of Miami to finalize the project\u2019s design and the permitted density, Pardo said.\nLast year, Forman Capital provided the loan to refinance a previous mortgage, records show.\nKodsi and former partner Rafael Pecchio previously planned a 200-unit apartment building. But Peccio bowed out, and Kodsi changed course last year with new plans for a condo-hotel with 360 units, including some short-term rentals.\nKodsi is fighting a separate foreclosure case involving his Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter that is currently under construction. Recently, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Spencer Eig gave the Kodsi entity developing the Miami Worldcenter project roughly two months to pay back more than\n$35 million\nto another lender, New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital.In July,\nMonarch\nfiled a foreclosure complaint tied to the partially built 50-story mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami. Kodsi\u2019 entity countersued Monarch.\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Dan Kodsi is no longer involved in the project, he and his attorney said.",

It comes more than two years after WeWork Capital Advisors defaulted on a $240 million loan backed by the 359,880-square-foot office building.\nThe listing price for the building is expected to be in the mid-$300-per-square-foot range, according to the Business Times. That would place the total value of the building in the mid-$120 million ballpark. The property was appraised at $124 million early last year. WeWork Capital Advisors bought the building in the fall of 2019 for $322.8 million, or under $900 per square foot.\nWeWork Capital Advisors\u2013a joint venture of the co-working pioneer and New York-based\u00a0 Rh\u00f4ne\nGroup\u2013defaulted on the $240 million loan in March 2023. At the time, the firm told its lenders it stopped making payments on the debt because WeWork, the coworking space housed in the structure, stopped making payments on its lease for 186,000 square feet in the building. WeWork began leasing space in the building a few years prior, according to the Business Times.\n\nWeWork stopped paying rent at 600 California in March 2023, though it maintains a presence at 600 California. The company filed to assume its lease in the building during bankruptcy proceedings last year, though it shaved down its footprint down to 43,520 square feet, per the Business Times. It also reduced the rent it would pay for the space and cut back the term of its lease, which now expires at the end of 2030.\nThe 600 California building went into receivership in November 2023. Trigild has been weighing selling the building for more than a year, according to the Business Times. The receiver has purportedly been waiting for the San Francisco office market to improve before listing the property for sale.\nAs of last month, JLL, which handles leasing at 600 California, was advertising more than 270,000 square feet in the building for lease, per the Business Times. By that metric, the building is roughly 75 percent vacant.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 175,000-square-foot standalone store has been vacant for four years.\nThe finished product won\u2019t be your typical warehouse.

Companies can rent space for six months or a year without making a long-term commitment.\nTenants at WareSpace\u2019s properties range from local tradespeople, like plumbers and electricians, to candle-makers to online resellers.\n\nWareSpace has 20 locations all over the country, including four other properties in Texas \u2014 three in Dallas-Fort Worth and one in Houston.\nThe Plano project points to the adaptive reuse opportunities for big box retail vacancies left by the bankruptcies and closures of stores like\nForever 21\nand Party City. While some spots are getting backfilled with experiential companies or\nfitness concepts\n, industrial conversion provides another option.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s industrial market has exploded in the last decade, moving the area to third among the nation\u2019s top markets, behind Los Angeles and Chicago. Despite weathering a glut of deliveries amid a period of rampant growth, vacancy in the market is still down, from 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2024 to 9.1 percent a year later, according to Partners Real Estate.\nEven so, Cohen said the strength of the area\u2019s industrial market isn\u2019t the top driver for his company\u2019s investment in DFW.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s not even about being an industrial hub. It\u2019s more that there\u2019s just a significant amount of people moving there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s just a huge market for us there, just based on the population count and the trajectory of where the city\u2019s going.\u201d\n",

Ikea, through Ingka Investments, will\nanchor the retail component\nwith 80,000 square feet and a one-third stake in the full project.\nThe developer completed a $175 million land buy earlier this year to round out the necessary assemblage.\nDelivery of the KPF-designed tower is expected by the end of 2028.\n\nIf finalized, the Simpson Thacher lease would mark a major win for Barnett at a time when securing tenants of that scale has become rare.\nThe law firm\u2019s deal joins other notable signings this year, including\nAmazon\u2019s 330,000-square-foot lease at 10 Bryant Park\nand Goodwin Procter\u2019s\n250,000-square-foot deal at 200 Fifth Avenue\n.\nNationally, law firms have been an outsized driver of office demand, signing nearly 6 million square feet in the first half of 2025, the sector\u2019s strongest showing since 2018, according to Savills.\nFor Barnett, the lease is validation of a strategic pivot. Extell in 2021\nfiled plans\nfor a 78-story mixed-use tower with more than 1,500 hotel rooms and nearly 500 apartments at the same site.\nInstead, the developer doubled down on the office play and\nsecured financing from South Korea\u2019s IGIS Asset Management\nto move forward.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A member of the Simkins family sold a waterfront home in North Bay Village to an investor who has been buying up houses in the three-island town,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe investor, Pawan Singh, has paid $61.5 million on 11 houses, many on the water, on Terrace Drive in\nNorth Bay Village\n, according to\nTRD\u2019s\nanalysis of property records. Singh has assembled at least 2.5 acres of land in the village via purchases in his name and LLCs linked to him. He likely controls more than 500 feet of water frontage, though it\u2019s not entirely contiguous.\nSingh is CEO of Vienna, Virginia-based NavX Consulting, a management and technology consulting firm, and previously was a principal at Deloitte, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a request for comment.\nHis latest purchase is the largest he\u2019s made since he began buying houses on the island in 2022. Last week, he paid $13.5 million for the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house at 1365 Bay Terrace. The property has 215 feet of waterfront.\nSingh purchased the property via a Falls Church, Virginia-based LLC. Simkins paid just over $3 million for the 3,700-square-foot house in 2016, records show. The corner lot includes a waterfront pool and dock. The five-bedroom, four-bathroom house was built in 1942.\nSingh\u2019s first purchase was in 2022, when he paid $3.9 million for the four-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 1480 South Treasure Drive. The 2,556-square-foot home, built in 1950, sits on a 0.2-acre lot with 60 feet of waterfront. Mark Stephan of Engel &amp; Voelkers brokered that deal.\n\nSingh has listed at least one of the properties for rent. The 2,015-square-foot, three-bedroom and four-bathroom house at 7401 Miami View Drive is asking\n$8,000 a month\n. It\u2019s listed with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Elizabeth Gazay.\nLarger assemblages of waterfront land have sold for record prices in Miami Beach over the past year.\nIn July, spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser and the Posner Group paid $105 million for\nthe 2.3-acre estate\nat 5940 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. The partners are looking to flip the property for $169 million, or rent it out for $495,000 a month, but Glaser is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listings.\nHomeowners in North Bay Village include developer Alexandra Eichner, Anatomy Fitness co-owner Marc Megna, the owners of Farrey\u2019s Lighting &amp; Bath, and a number of real estate agents, including Sam Heskial, Sari Libben Shapiro and Chris Wands, property records show.\nWands, an agent with Douglas Elliman, said the neighborhood\u2019s location and security appealed to him and his wife when they moved in 2021. North Bay Island is a gated community.\n\u201cI felt it was undervalued with the connectivity to the beach and the mainland. Without traffic, I\u2019m in the Design District or beach in 10 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife loved the idea that it had its own municipalities, police and fire.\u201d\nLast month, a Miami businessman sold the waterfront home at 7520 West Treasure Drive\nfor $12.5 million\n, marking one of the priciest deals ever recorded in the town and the most expensive on Treasure Island.\nA handful of major condo and mixed-use projects are also planned in the town, including developments led by Related Group and Macklowe Properties, the Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties, a partnership led by Vivian Dimond, the Eichners\u2019 Continuum Company and Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons.\n",

        "content": "Waterton has tightened its grip on Chicago\u2019s rental housing market, shelling out nearly $90 million for a Fulton Market apartment tower while weighing the sale of another downtown property.\nThe multifamily investment firm paid $89.5 million, or $340,300 per apartment, for The Mason, a 263-unit building at 180 North Ada Street, according to property records. The 14-story tower opened in 2019 and was developed by Naperville-based Marquette Cos. and Deutsche Bank affiliate DWS Group, which put it up for sale in April, CoStar\nreported\n.\nCasey Mog, the firm\u2019s vice president of acquisitions, said the firm leapt at the opportunity to add a property in the West Loop back into their portfolio, following the $35 million sale of the 81-unit property at 20 North Aberdeen Street to JAB Real Estate, which notched a 13 percent discount from the property\u2019s previous value with the deal.\nThe acquisition pulls one of Fulton Market\u2019s most prominent listings off the market in a neighborhood that has seen some of the city\u2019s\npriciest\nmultifamily deals. Earlier this year, a New York investor\npaid $170 million\nfor the 375-unit Fulbrix tower on Elizabeth Street, less than a block away.\n\nWaterton\u2019s move comes as the firm could just as\neasily\nbe a seller. In August, it listed the 346-unit Grand Central apartments in the South Loop, less than two years after buying the property for $81.9 million. The dual strategy follows the 2023 close of its $1.73 billion value-add fund, one of the largest of its kind in the country.\nMarquette and DWS had financed the property with a $54.7 million Wells Fargo loan in 2022. The partnership sold another downtown asset, the 223-unit Catalyst tower, for $94 million earlier this year. They didn\u2019t disclose what they had hoped to fetch for The Mason. CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Danny Zeboski, along with Eastdil Secured\u2019s Kenneth Glomb and Bryan Rosenberg, marketed the sale.\nThe Mason\u2019s amenities include a rooftop lounge, co-working areas, fitness club and a pool deck with cabanas and fire pits.\nWaterton\nsaid it will make light upgrades to units, common areas and amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A bruising, decade-long development process and ensuing court fight over a newly built suburban Chicago apartment complex ended with a $65 million sale\nJSB Capital Group\nlast week.\nRescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments, based in Kansas City, Missouri, gave the green light to sell the Lincoln Station property in New Lenox, a southwest suburb, to the Miami-based JSB following a lawsuit it filed against developer Richard Gammonley, who has a checkered past of real estate investments in the Chicago area, public records show.\nThe 220-unit property completed in 2024 at 208 North Prairie Road was originally conceived in the mid-2010s, when Gammonley was trying to pitch a more than 300-unit plan to New Lenox officials. Due to concerns with the scope of the proposal, however, the project was scaled back, and was finally completed as five separate buildings, each with 44 units, that sits near the town\u2019s Metra train station connecting to downtown Chicago.\nBut the project ran into financial trouble. Gammonley\u2019s development venture turned to 7 Acre, led by Adam Fletcher and Chase Watson, for more debt to help complete the project about a year ago. The Lincoln Station developer borrowed $1.4 million in September 2024 to help fund cost overruns on the project, public records show. As collateral for the loan, the Gammonley venture pledged 76 percent of the ownership interest in the LLC used as the property\u2019s owner.\nYet by November, Gammonley was in default on the debt to 7 Acre, according to a letter contained in Missouri court records from the lender to the developers. In December, 7 Acre filed a lawsuit against Gammonley, who has tussled with lenders over multifamily and condo developments in the Chicago area multiple times throughout his career, previous reports said.\nGammonley fought back against the allegations. He claimed that after 7 Acre made the loan, it improperly tried to insert itself into the decision-making process as the development team was looking to sell Lincoln Station, with the understanding that the lender would be paid back out of the proceeds from the sale.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, 7 Acre interfered with two separate purchase negotiations for the property, that were all but under contract in the months of November and December 2024, by attempting to raise purchase price and altering the core structure of the deals in the last hour,\u201d Gammonley alleged.\nHe argued the conduct of the lender caused the debt to enter default and that 7 Acre should be blocked from asserting its right to take majority control of the property\u2019s ownership.\nJSB and 7 Acre did not respond to a request for comment, nor did attorneys for Gammonley.\nThe lawsuit was settled earlier this month, but a person familiar with the situation said 7 Acre ended up in control of most of the property ahead of the sale. The developers made little to no money on the transaction, after factoring project costs, despite only taking out a $34 million senior construction loan in 2022 to fund the development, the source said. The developers incurred additional debt behind that loan that was separate from the 7 Acre loan to complete the buildings.\nThe deal closed as\ninterest from institutional landlords is ramping up\nin Chicago-area multifamily properties, due to rising rents stemming from the low supply of new development projects on the horizon amid difficult fundraising conditions in real estate equity markets. Earlier this month, Waterton, one of the nation\u2019s largest apartment landlords, paid $90 million for a property in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market neighborhood, on the heels of\ntwo other trades in the city\u2019s suburbs that each exceeded $100 million\n, the first in\nVernon Hills\nand the second in Naperville.\n",

        "content": "A development approved by the Chicago Plan Commission will bring one of the first hotels to the Far South Side in decades.\nConstruction is expected to begin on the $30 million, 101-room hotel in the Pullman neighborhood early next year. Located at 111th Street and Doty Avenue, the 62,000 square foot, 4-story Hampton by Hilton Hotel will be the first ever nationally branded hotel in the neighborhood.\nThe Pullman Hotel Group LLC bought the land from Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives with a $5 million grant from the city of Chicago\u2019s Recovery Grant Program. It also received a $100,000 pre-development grant from the Chicago Community Trust.\nThe project is the latest in a series of investments in the far south side community that began with a Walmart Super Center opening in 2014, followed by two Gotham Greens greenhouses, an SC Johnson warehouse, an Amazon fulfillment center and a Whole Foods Distribution Center.\n\u201cNone of this could have happened without Walmart. Walmart was the first catalyst that broke the ice for us, and that created the synergy to keep the ball rolling,\u201d said 9th Ward Alderman Anthony Beale.\nThe past 10 years of development are starting to turn the tides for a neighborhood that experienced redlining and other disinvestment methods from the public and private sectors throughout much of the last 75 years.\n\nThe hotel will also serve visitors to the Pullman National Historical Park which was designated a national monument by President Barack Obama in 2015. The historic site commemorates the history of the Pullman Company Town which was developed in the late 1800s to serve workers from the Pullman Luxury Rail Car factory.\nWorking-class residents of the town went on to play a key role in early labor and civil rights movements including the establishment of the The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which was the first all-African-American labor union in the country.\nUntil recently, much of the major economic activity taking place on the south side of Chicago centered around The University of Chicago in Hyde Park.\nBut investment has been expanding to Bronzeville, South Shore and some farther south side communities including Pullman.\nIn Bronzeville, a megadevelopment centered on medical technology and services could provide an economic boon to the community that was once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cBlack Metropolis.\u201d Speculation has\nspurred multifamily interest\nbut\nslow progress on the megadevelopment\nis casting doubt on the overall impact it will have on the area.\nMeanwhile, farther south of Hyde Park, the near completion of the Obama Presidential Library is making waves. The area has seen renewed investor interest including\na 28-story hotel proposal\nat 6402 South Stony Island Drive.\nAlso on the far south side, the state of Illinois is providing $500 million toward a $9 billion\nquantum computing campus\nled by CRG and Related Midwest that is planned for the former U.S. Steel South Works site, which closed in 1992.",

In late August, though, the judge overseeing the case approved Rialto\u2019s request to withdraw its motion to declare RFR in default.\n\nA spokesperson for Rialto was not immediately available for comment and a representative for RFR declined to comment. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger is overseeing the note-sale process.\nRFR bought the building for $37 million in 2000, and refinanced in 2017 with a $104.5 million loan from Goldman Sachs, which sold the debt off to CMBS investors.\nThe 137,000-square-foot building had recently been partially leased to Compass, which had an 89,000-square-foot office there. Compass\nsevered its lease\n, though, and now the 126,000-square-foot office portion is completely vacant.\nRialto and Rosen\nhave sparred before\n, and in some instances have been able to work out deals. RFR negotiated a settlement when Rialto sued the company over 17 State Street. But the rules of engagement are stricter when it comes to CMBS investors, which Rialto is representing in this action.\n",

        "content": "A player in the Hamptons trophy market has unlocked another achievement.\nMatthew Karch, co-founder of video game developer Saber Interactive, paid $31.5 million for a 1970s-era oceanfront estate in East Hampton Village, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. The home lines up with Zillow images and past reports as 33 Lily Pond Lane.\nThe sale breaks down to $4,500 per square foot.\nThe roughly two-acre spread sits directly on the beach with a 7,000-square-foot main house, a guesthouse, tennis court and pool.\nKarch said the location sold him \u2014 \u201cthe house literally sits on top of the ocean\u201d \u2014 and he plans to replace the existing five-bedroom residence with a build he\u2019ll use as a second home.\nThe sellers, Norman and Helene Stark, owned the property since 1994, when they bought it for $4.7 million. They first floated it for $75 million in 2017, pulling it on and off the market over the years before cutting the ask to $39 million.\n\nKarch, who is based in Florida, isn\u2019t new to the Hamptons. He owns two homes in Sag Harbor and told the outlet he may sell one now that he\u2019s secured his East Hampton oceanfront perch. In 2020, he paid\n$10 million\nfor a condominium unit at Auberge Beach Residences &amp; Spa in Fort Lauderdale.\nFounded in 2001, Saber Interactive counts more than 1,300 employees among its ranks. Notable games developed by the company include Will Rock, TimeShift and NBA Playgrounds.\nThe East Hampton deal underscores how quickly the East End\u2019s ultra-luxury market has bounced back from a recent lull. Pandemic-driven demand drove prices to records, but sales slowed sharply in early 2023 as inventory thinned and mortgage rates spiked, according to a Douglas Elliman report from Jonathan Miller.\nMomentum turned late in 2023 when closings were up annually in the fourth quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. By this summer, brokers say, the market was moving at its fastest clip since the pandemic boom.\nThat\u2019s borne out in the numbers: in the second quarter, there were 26 trades at $10 million or higher, up from 22 a year earlier and just six in 2023, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller\u2019s Douglas Elliman report.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "One of Miami Beach\u2019s last gas stations will be redeveloped into a mixed-use Class A office building,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nArkadia\nProperty Group, led by Richard Kilstock and David Aaron, closed on acquisition of the gas station and car wash at 1840 Alton Road last week, Aaron said. The Bal Harbour-based firm plans to develop a 40,000-square-foot office building with 2,500 square feet of food and beverage retail space on the 0.4-acre property.\nIt\u2019s in the\nSunset Harbour\nneighborhood. The building, called Sunset House, will be 75 feet tall and will include at least one residential-office live-work unit, which is required by the zoning. Arkadia secured zoning changes two years ago that will allow the developer and neighboring property owners to build an additional 10 feet of height, Aaron said.\nThe deal has been in the works for more than a decade. Aaron said that he and his partner bought an option to purchase the property 12 years ago. Mika Mattingly, now with Colliers, was involved in arranging that contract in 2013.\nProperty records show Alton Road Supreme Services, led by Jose M. Suarez, sold the site. It was developed in 1997. It\u2019s one of six gas stations left in Miami Beach.\n\u201cWe saw this convergence of neighborhoods and we knew something was happening but we didn\u2019t pretend to know what and when,\u201d Aaron said. The deal was originally structured as a sale-leaseback, but it fell apart at the last minute. \u201cThe only solution we found was to create an option for the property.\u201d\nKilstock said in a statement that the neighborhood has \u201cchanged dramatically over the past 12 years.\u201d\nArkadia paid $4.2 million for the property, Aaron said.\n\nAaron pointed to the \u201cclear demand\u201d for new office space in the area, and the lack of available office space at\nEighteen Sunset\n, a five-story office project in Sunset Harbour being developed by Bradley Colmer\u2019s Deco Capital Group and billionaire Marc Rowan\u2019s RWN Real Estate Partners. Audemars Piguet is among the tenants set to open.\nEighteen Sunset has reportedly signed leases at $160 per square foot, net.\nKobi Karp of Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design designed the new project.\nNewmark\u2019s Matt Himmelsbach was hired to handle office leasing, and Sara Wolfe of Wolfe Town Retail will lease the retail space. Robert Kaplan and Mark Rutherford of Cushman &amp; Wakefield were the debt brokers on the deal. Mark Meland and Bryan Vega at Meland Budwick, and land use attorney Michael Larkin of Berkow were also involved.\nThe building could be delivered about 30 months from now, Aaron said. The developer will complete the required environmental remediation.\nProspective tenants could include residents on\nNorth Bay Road\n, the Sunset and Venetian islands, and Sunset Harbour. Preleasing is underway, Himmelsbach said. He declined to disclose asking rents.\n\u201cSunset Harbour is extremely demanded and special. People want to work there but there\u2019s no supply,\u201d Himmelsbach said. \u201cThere\u2019s a missing hole that this building will fill.\u201d\n",

Maxxam Enterprises did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe building at 1453-1457 3rd Street Promenade, called Promenade Gateway, is worth $180 million and hasn\u2019t lost value since underwriting a decade ago. But the decline in occupancy cut into income and cash flow, which each dropped to $3 million in June, compared to almost $9 million two years ago.\nThe latest servicer commentary before the refinancing loan was transferred to special servicing, indicated that the borrower has been marketing the property since the second quarter of last year and is looking for tenants. The largest occupants include Luma Pictures, Like Labs, Lululemon, Riverside Partners and Rialto Capital Management, which account for 42 percent of the space.\nThe property has 61,000 square feet of office, 33,300 square feet of retail and 32 multifamily units.\nThird Street Promenade\nhas been in an economic decline since the pandemic. Shops, bars and restaurants have less foot traffic, resulting in empty storefronts. That got politicians\u2019 attention: The city council in May\napproved\na proposal to turn the area into an entertainment zone, meaning people could buy alcohol from businesses and drink their drinks outside \u2014 very Vegas-esque.

        "content": "The site of the Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Francisco is slated to become a life sciences complex, though developer SteelWave still has some hurdles to clear.\nThe San Mateo-based firm won approval from the city Planning Commission on a 12-year development agreement to redevelop the Golden Gate Produce Terminal into a 2.5 million-square-foot, five-building life sciences campus, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nWith SteelWave\u2019s approval secured, the famous\nGolden Gate Produce Terminal\nwill have to consider a major relocation for a second time in its history. It left its former home in San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero during the area\u2019s redevelopment in the 1960s, ending up in South San Francisco in 1969. The Golden Gate property is one of the largest and busiest produce terminals across Northern California, providing restaurants, retailers and members of the public access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\nSouth San Francisco has gained a reputation as one of the country\u2019s top life sciences hubs. But the past four years in the biotech industry have faced a cut in funding from investors and venture capital firms as well as a glut of millions of square feet of new space coming online. That has sent Bay Area life sciences vacancy rates higher than 25 percent, according to the Business Times.\n\nOnce a project is approved, developers usually have two to three years to secure permits and start construction, according to the Business Times. When SteelWave decides to dig shovels in the ground remains to be seen, but the Produce Terminal can remain in operation until then.\nSteelWave leased the 17.6-acre produce terminal site at 131 Terminal Court in 2022. SteelWave bought another 8.7-acre site at 101 Terminal Court for $85 million. Its planned biotech projects are known as Infinite 101 and Infinite 131. The Infinite 101 site is set aside for life sciences and won city approval in 2023 for 700,000 square feet. If the City Council approves the development agreement, it would essentially extend the timeline for development of Infinite 101 and provide development approvals for Infinite 131 with another roughly 1.7 million square feet.\nAt the same time, the City of South San Francisco is considering rezoning five adjacent parcels along Produce Avenue and Terminal Court to allow for \u201cbusiness technology,\u201d according to the Business Times.\nTwo other biotech projects in South San Francisco \u2014\nIQHQ\u2019s development\nat 800 Dubuque Avenue and Steelwave\u2019s project at 180 El Camino Real \u2014 are looking to extend development rights in the hope that the biotech market will bounce back.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Some of South Florida\u2019s biggest developers are in secretive talks to develop a rare, 38-acre waterfront property in Miami.\nIt\u2019s the Miami-Dade County-owned Miami Seaquarium property on Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay, and little is known about proposals so far, according to reporting from the\nMiami Herald\n.\nIntegra\nInvestments, headed by Paulo Tavares de Melo, has submitted a 28-page presentation on its vision for the site.\nDavid Martin\nof\nTerra\nhas also thrown his hat in the ring, and signed an NDA to do so, the outlet reported. A spokesperson for Martin declined the outlet\u2019s request for comment, and it is unclear whether the developer has submitted a formal proposal.\nCounty leaders have expressed interest in a marina on the site.\n\u201cA marina has always been a discussed use there,\u201d Miami-Dade Commissioner Raquel Regalado told the outlet. Regalado is the commission\u2019s representative in lease talks with the Dolphin Company, and the\nSeaquarium\nsite is part of her district.\n\u201cOn the county\u2019s side, there has always been a desire to expand marinas and to expand dry-dock storage,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cThat\u2019s a big need for the county.\u201d\nIt may mark the end for the Seaquarium, which opened in 1955, and is one of the oldest oceanariums in the country, according to reports. Famously, the hit 1960s show Flipper filmed at the theme park.\n\nThe Seaquarium\u2019s parent company, Mexico-based Dolphin Company, has a ground lease with the county for the site at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway. The county filed an\neviction lawsuit against Miami Seaquarium\nlast year, alleging Dolphin failed to maintain Miami Seaquarium in good repair and clean condition. The county also alleged the Seaquarium was in violation of the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary, according to published reports.\nSeaquarium representatives deny the allegations, the Herald reported. Dolphin, led by CEO Eduardo Albor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, and is seeking to raise cash in its restructuring, according to\nreports\n.\nIt\u2019s been a contentious process. In April, Albor and about 20 armed men took control of Dolphin\u2019s Cancun headquarters,\nBloomberg\nreported. In June, a U.S. bankruptcy judge moved to Sanction Albor for $10,000 a day, in response to him defying court orders,\nWLRN\nreported.\nAs the company restructures and pursues deals, Miami-Dade has a unique position to weigh in on the future of the Seaquarium property. Because the site is county-owned, any agreement Dolphin came to with Integra, Terra, or another firm, would require a vote by the county commission. Redevelopment of the site is also complicated by its land use restrictions. The property is part of the county parks system, which means condos and apartments are likely a no-go.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "And the seller is \u2026\nBrad Pitt, who closed on the sale of his Los Feliz Mid-century Modern pad on Friday,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe Los Angeles home, dubbed The Steel House for its steel frame, was being shopped around by the Oscar winner off market, with an asking price of $5.5 million, according to sources familiar with the deal. The closing price and buyer were not immediately known.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Marci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi, who\nrepresented\nPitt on the sale, declined comment.\nPitt bought the home from oil heiress and philanthropist\nAileen Getty\nin 2023 for $5.5 million. The trade was part of a swap of sorts, with Getty paying $33 million for Pitt\u2019s Craftsman-style home in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe Steel House is tucked away on a hill surrounded by palm trees and other landscaping, with three beds and two baths. The property made headlines of its own in June when\nburglars\ntargeted the residence while Pitt was away.\nThe actor appears to be doing some fine tuning of his real estate portfolio, with the Carolwood connection handling Pitt\u2019s purchase of a\n$12 million home\nin the Hollywood Hills last month. The Killers lead guitarist Dave Keuning and his wife and interior designer, Emilie Keuning, sold the home to Pitt, after originally asking nearly $14 million for the hillside abode. It has six beds and eight baths across 8,400 square feet.\nThat Hollywood Hills deal highlights the Carolwood agents\u2019 respective ties to colleagues in the entertainment business, with Mogharrabi counting connections to many of the agents and managers at Creative Artists Agency and William Morris Endeavor. Kays, meanwhile, is dialed into the music world.\nIn June, the duo set a record in Silver Lake with the priciest residential sale in the neighborhood when the five-bed, five-bath home at\n1844 Silverwood Terrace\nclosed for $10 million.\nLast year, Kays and Mogharrabi closed on about $100 million in sales volume.\n",

        "content": "A Kenilworth mansion on Lake Michigan\u2019s shore sold for $6.8 million on Thursday after sitting on the market for four years and taking a more than 50 percent price cut from its listing.\nThe 11,000 square-foot estate at 501 Sheridan Road sits on two lots on the Kenilworth lakefront, covering 1.6 acres. It has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, including a one-bedroom guest suite. The second lot featured a sculpture garden under the previous owners. The sale came out to $618 per square foot.\nThe home, which was built in the 1960s and expanded in 2006, was first listed on a\nprivate market in 2021\n, asking $14 million. It hit the\npublic market in 2022\nfor $14 million, but underwent several price chops before its last listing price at $7.7 million.\nThe ultimate $6.8 million price tag makes it among the most expensive Kenilworth properties sold in recent years, despite the steep drops. One mansion fetched a record $11.75 million in 2020, and another home sold for $9.5 million in 2021, both on Sheridan Road.\nThe buyers plan to tear down the estate and build a new house on the land, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s agent Nancy Nugent, who represented the sellers on the deal, said. Nugent did not name the buyers, and their identity is not available in public records.\nMilena Birov of @properties, who represented the buyers, did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe home was last owned by the late Yadelle and Robert Sklare, and their family managed the sale through their estate, Nugent said. Robert Sklare died in 2008, and Yadelle Sklare died in 2021.\nNugent said the time on the market and big price cuts were in part because the sellers were not in a rush to sell the house. Some offers on the house came when they were not ready to sell, and the family spent time appraising art and organizing an estate sale before selling, she said.\n\u201cWe were ambitious about pricing, but soon realized that we kept clipping the number, and I think my clients, when they were finally ready to let go of the property is when we sold it,\u201d Nugent said.\nMost potential buyers were interested in tearing down the house, and the surge in materials and construction costs in 2021 and 2022 factored into what buyers were willing to pay, Nugent said.\nBecause of the sellers\u2019 situation and the property being a teardown, Nugent said she doesn\u2019t think the drastic price cut is a signal for other high-priced homes in Kenilworth. Space on the lake is sparse, and turnkey homes move quickly on the North Shore.\nJust a few blocks south on Sheridan Road, a\n$15 million, 8,280 square-foot mansion\nreached a pending deal just two weeks after listing. Two more homes in Kenilworth \u2014 one at $6.9 million and one at $6.5 million \u2014 got contingent offers about a month after listing.\n\u201cIf the house is turnkey, it commands whatever the buyer is willing to pay,\u201d Nugent said. \u201cBecause Kenilworth in particular is a very small community, and this was one of the last bastions of teardown properties in Kenilworth.\u201d",

Architect Jack Hemphill designed the nearly 21,000-square-foot home on 3.2 acres. At $1,362 per square foot, it\u2019s one of the priciest listings within Dallas city limits, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nOnly the Crespi Estate\ntops\nit, among Dallas homes on the market, with an asking price of $64 million and $2,362 per square foot.\nDallas Central Appraisal District records show\nThe property\u2019s ownership is hidden behind the Four Thousand Trust, which acquired it in 2022 following Maguire\u2019s death. Over the past two and a half years, the owners poured millions into upgrades, reimagining the mansion for modern living before a job transfer forced a change of plans.\n\u201cThe whole home has been completely redone,\u201d said Compass broker\nFaisal Halum\n, who has the listing.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a house \u2014 it\u2019s a stage. A great hall stretches the length of the first floor, with refinished parquet floors and custom fixtures. A two-story den with a 23-foot ceiling anchors the home, while the glass conservatory, Art Deco bar and barrel-vaulted banquet hall provide ample space for gatherings. The estate also features a black-lacquered lounge, a wine room, and a sculptural brass tub in the primary suite.\nThe estate\u2019s guest list reads like a who\u2019s who of 20th-century politics. Both Bush presidents, Gerald Ford and Margaret Thatcher walked its halls, while Czech President Vaclav Klaus and Cowboys legend Roger Staubach also made appearances. Maguire\u2019s extensive presidential memorabilia collection once filled the home and was part of the attraction, including Benjamin Harrison\u2019s White House china and busts of every U.S. president.\nHalum called the offering a rare chance to secure land and legacy in one of Dallas\u2019 most\nexclusive\nenclaves, and said grabbing acreage in Preston Hollow is almost impossible.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Another week, another peak sale hit the books in New York City \u2014 this time, in Staten Island.\nA sprawling mansion in Todt Hill, the borough\u2019s premier luxury neighborhood, snagged a record-breaking deal when it closed for $8.5 million, the New York Post first reported. The sale marked Staten Island\u2019s most expensive of all time, beating a $4.6 million deal notched just a year prior.\nThe 11,000-square-foot estate, which has a basketball court, pool and hair salon, hit the market last September asking $9 million. The sellers, Richard and Vania Cardinale of Farm to Bagel, paid just $1.7 million for the property in 2017 and shelled out $6 million to build the eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom home.\nNews of the sale comes as home prices in Staten Island rose last month, with the borough\u2019s median sale price up nearly 9 percent in August compared to the same month last year, according to data from Redfin.\n\u201cStaten Island always seems to be the forgotten borough,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Tom Le, who had the listing for 176 Benedict Road. \u201cIt should get more attention than it does.\u201d\nThe deal for 176 Benedict Road blew past the norm for Staten Island, where the typical home traded for $750,000 in August. But the neighborhood is also home to two other likely exceptions to the local market.\nThe next priciest are a listing for another home on Benedict Road, a six-bedroom abode asking $5.7 million, and a 5,800-square-foot property on High Point Road asking $2.5 million, according to Zillow.\nHomes on Benedict Road purchased in the last two decades have been gut-renovated or knocked down and rebuilt into larger mansions, Le added, which will likely yield even pricier deals when they trade in the coming years.\nOne such deal could be for the mansion across the street, which once belonged to the head of the Gambino crime family, Paul Castellano. The mob boss\u2019 former estate at 177 Benedict Road hit the market two years ago, asking\n$17 million\n. Now priced at $18 million, it\u2019s the most expensive listing in Staten Island.\nNot so fast\u2026\nA contentious divorce between two fashion icons is throwing the fate of some of New York\u2019s swankiest real estate into question.\nNet-A-Porter founder Natalie Massenet sued her husband, Frame Denim co-founder Erik Torstensson, in a Los Angeles court last month, alleging he swindled her out of $95 million during their roughly 15-year relationship and had drug, alcohol and sex addictions.\n\nTorstensson hit back with his own claim in New York court earlier this week when he filed for custody of their 7-year-old son amid allegations that Massenet used drugs, drank heavily and became occasionally \u201cviolent\u201d with Torstensson, the\nNew York Times\nreported.\nThe couple\u2019s messy split will likely extend to their businesses and homes, including their double-wide townhouse on the Upper East Side. An entity tied to Massenet bought the property on East 74th Street for\n$25 million\nin 2019 from developers Larry Gluck and Ivan Hakimian.\nAt the time of the sale, the 12,000-square-foot historic mansion was about 80 percent complete.\nMassenet and Torstensson then embarked on a two-year renovation of the home, which was temporarily thwarted by a rogue sprinkler, which saturated the home, the couple\ntold the Wall Street Journal in 2022\n. The duo then bought the neighboring property with plans to combine it with the under-construction homes.\nThe couple also owns a home in East Hampton on Further Lane, which may have been the site of an extravagant Louis Vuitton garden party featured in Vogue last summer. The article describes the soiree\u2019s setting as a \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cSaltburn-like estate,\u201d where the fashion brand drove guests around the grounds, including a Japanese maple tree sanctuary, in branded Jeeps.\nMassenet hosted the party alongside writer Derek Blasberg and the crown princess of Greece, Marie-Chantal.\nAlso in the pair\u2019s portfolio is an estate outside London known as Donhead House, the renovation of which was featured in the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for a townhouse on the Upper East Side, which closed for\n$21 million\n, or $3,300 per square foot. The deal was less than its 2005 purchase price when the sellers bought it for $22 million and later renovated it.\nThe 20-foot-wide home at 16 East 64th Street, built in the late 1800s, hit the market last March asking $25 million. It spans 8,700 square feet and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, an elevator and two terraces.\nLeslie Garfield\u2019s Thomas Wexler and Tyler Wexler had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Every day brings New York City closer to an election that could prove to have major ramifications for real estate, which is responding with a groundswell of its own.\nAt the start of the week, Jeff Blau and Aby Rosen\norganized a meeting\nof prominent developers to support Andrew Cuomo for mayor and oppose Zohran Mamdani, as first reported by The New York Times.\nDespite Cuomo\u2019s primary loss to Mamdani, he is seen as a top contender, while incumbent Eric Adams is being pressured to suspend his re-election campaign.\nWorth noting: not every real estate figure opposes Mamdani. Affordable housing developers in particular are engaging with his campaign due to his housing-focused agenda.\nIn the city\u2019s office market, JPMorgan is\nmarketing\nits 23-story office building at 125 West 55th Street \u2014 Avenue of the Americas Plaza \u2014 for $270 million, half the asking price from early 2020.\nThe building is currently half empty, with vacancies concentrated on the higher floors.\nThe listing price reflects a trend in the Manhattan office market where buildings are still trading at discounts due to high interest rates and the costs of attracting tenants, even as overall leasing activity is recovering.\n\nWhile Jamie Dimon is looking to dispose of an office building, Meyer Chetrit isn\u2019t willing to let go of assets that could be used in a judgment against him \u2014 at least that\u2019s what\u2019s being alleged.\nMaverick Real Estate Partners\nclaims\nMeyer Chetrit is fraudulently shielding assets to evade a $132 million judgement.\nA lawsuit filed by Maverick focuses on a debt document between Chetrit and business partner Gadi Ben Hamo, which Maverick claims is a false attempt to remove assets.\nBen Hamo denied the allegations, stating the debt is legitimate and that Maverick is trying to acquire debt at a discount. Ben Hamo is considering a counterclaim.\nFinally, Silver Creek Development\nacquired the lease\nfor the former Ritz-Carlton hotel, rebranded as the Wagner in 2018, in Battery Park City after a three-year bankruptcy process.\nThe previous owners, Taylor Woods and Howard Wu of Urban Commons, accumulated significant debts and faced multiple legal issues, including charges of fraud and misappropriation of funds.\nWoods and Wu were removed from controlling the hotel\u2019s debtor entity and ultimately received no proceeds from the bankruptcy sale, where Silver Creek emerged as the sole bidder.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a mantra often repeated to the parents of young children. The phrase is especially true if you\u2019re living in a cramped New York City apartment in the dead of winter with restless toddlers. Michael Schoen and Chris de Koos are hoping to capitalize on that.\nTheir company, Little Big Hospitality,\ninked a 15-year, 45,000-square-foot lease\nthis summer at CIM Group\u2019s long-vacant office building at 50 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. The firm plans to use the space to open The Beginning Clubhouse,\na private family-oriented club\nthat will offer curated programming and classes for children, childcare, food and beverage options, and fitness and wellness amenities.\nSchoen, a Brooklyn dad with a background in commercial real estate, said he got the idea for the business during his family\u2019s temporary relocation to London. There, he joined a small club where parents could drop off young children for classes and playtime while slipping away for a sauna or spa treatment.\n\u201cThat was kind of when the light bulb went off,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018how does this space not exist in New York?\u2019\u201d\nThe seven-story clubhouse will merge the best of adult-focused clubs like Soho House with the needs of families. Plans call for a rooftop pizza oven and garden, a screening room and bowling alley. U.K. design firm Tigerplay is designing a custom indoor jungle gym. There will also be a restaurant and bar.\n\u201cWe want this to be a place where you can come for date night, or meet friends, just as much as you can bring the whole family,\u201d Schoen said.\nThe choice of 50 Columbia Heights is as much about real estate as it is about lifestyle. The 1920s brick and timber structure once belonged to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as part of their vast Brooklyn Heights campus.\nCIM Group acquired it in 2016\nalong with the rest of the five-building complex. Built into the side of a hill, the property is connected to Furman Street by a dramatic steel staircase that leads to a garden. But CIM never found a tenant.\nThe lease marks a turning point. Brooklyn\u2019s office market has lagged Manhattan\u2019s recovery, and much of the Panorama development was caught up in the pandemic\u2019s work-from-home fallout.\n\u201cThis revitalizes it with a use that feels like a home run, given the density in the area and how families already use Brooklyn Bridge Park as their backyard,\u201d said Dan Marks, CEO of Brooklyn brokerage TerraCRG.\nThe concept appears to be striking a chord. The Beginning has already drawn more than 1,500 membership applications, surpassing the expected cap of 1,200 families. Schoen envisions the Columbia Heights building as the flagship, but says interest is already coming from other cities like Chicago and Nashville.\nBut for now, he\u2019s focused on Brooklyn.\n\u201cBrooklyn is home, and this is where it begins,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNew York City\u2019s hotel market is on fire, according to several brokers I\u2019ve spoken with and a\nrecent Wall Street Journal\narticle. So why do\nmany owners\nseem to be\nstruggling\n? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThere will soon be more private money spent on the construction of data centers than office buildings. While office construction spending has declined significantly since 2019, data center spending has surged, reaching an annual rate of nearly $40 billion in mid-2025, compared with $44.17 billion on office space, according U.S. Census Bureau data. Not surprisingly, the rise is largely driven by AI and cloud computing.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2013 Gov. Kathy Hochul declared this the safest summer for New York\u2019s subways in 15 years, according to the\nNew York Times\n. There were 480 major crimes \u2013\u00a0 which include robbery, burglary, grand larceny, assault, murder and rape \u2013 recorded in the subway from June to August, a 9 percent drop compared with the same period last year and the fewest since at least 2009, the governor\u2019s office told the Times. Felony assault fell to 31 incidents in August from 52 the same month last year.\n\u2014 The killings of a couple in their 70s shocked their Queens neighborhood after a fire set by their killer consumed their home of more than 40 years. Prosecutors said Friday they had tracked down Jamel McGriff, the man accused of killing Frank and Maureen Olton, after he used the victims\u2019 credit card to pay for items that he bought with his own Macy\u2019s loyalty card number,\nNBC 4 reported\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$15 million\nfor 330 Spring Street, 12A. The Hudson Square condo unit at The Urban Glass House is 4,300 square feet. The last on-market sale of the unit was in 2007, when it sold for $11.2 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7.3 million\nfor 208 Centre Street. The mixed-use rental building in Little Italy is five stories and 12,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29 million for 18 East 71st Street. The Lenox Hill townhome has seven floors and is 13,000 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nAdam Schneider has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 32,507-square-foot, three-story, mixed-use building at 1677 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Architect Richard Bienenfeld is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority is bleeding senior talent, with its human resources chief the latest to head for the exits.\nDominick Maniscalco, who has served as CHA\u2019s deputy chief of HR since 2021, resigned the first week of September to become chief HR officer for Milwaukee Public Schools. He is the ninth senior leader to leave the nation\u2019s third-largest housing authority in the past year, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nIn an email to staff, Maniscalco praised colleagues\u2019 \u201cdedication and talent\u201d and said he was proud of how the department had moved HR forward since 2021. He declined further comment. CHA spokesperson Matthew Aguilar confirmed the resignation but declined to elaborate, citing personnel rules.\nManiscalco\u2019s exit follows a string of high-level shakeups at the agency, which oversees more than 65,000 households and owns more than 21,000 public housing units across Chicago. Former CEO Tracey Scott left\nearlier\nthis year, while other leaders \u2014 including chief development officer Ann McKenzie and chief of staff Dan Cruz \u2014 were terminated without public explanation. Former COO Eric Garrett resigned in January, and general counsel Ellen Harris stepped down in August after staff accused her of fostering a\ntoxic workplace\n.\n\nThe turnover has proven costly. CHA paid out more than $787,000 in\nseparation agreements\nto senior staff over the past five years. Ryan Ross, a senior director of asset management, was ousted for violating procedures that cost the agency over $19,000.\nThe churn comes as CHA is\nwithout\na permanent CEO. Interim chief Angela Hurlock stepped down Sept. 2, leaving board chair Matthew Brewer to take over as operating chairman. The agency\nfloated\nretired\nAlderman Walter Burnett Jr.\nas its next leader, but the vote has been delayed while the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reviews conflict-of-interest waivers tied to his appointment.\nDespite the leadership vacuum, CHA is pressing ahead with initiatives aimed at expanding housing options and boosting safety for residents. But the rapid-fire departures at the top of the agency cast doubt on its ability to\ndeliver\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Riaz Capital bought an apartment complex in downtown Berkeley for 20 percent under the property\u2019s assessed value amid a wave of distress in the market.\nAn affiliate of the Oakland-based real estate manager bought the Dwight apartments for $37.8 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That works out to $381,600 per unit for the 99-unit property at 2121 Dwight Way. The seller\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe multifamily market in the Bay Area, particularly the East Bay, hit a patch of rough waters over the past year. While some properties are trading hands, albeit at lower prices than their assessed values, many property owners have fallen into loan default and faced foreclosure.\nSlow job growth when apartment development has outpaced demand is part of the problem, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap. Higher vacancy rates across the Bay Area have weakened rental levels in certain areas, creating financial hurdles for apartment owners attempting to repay mortgages.\n\nSo far this month, several multifamily properties in the region have traded hands.\nLast week, the 230-unit\nLINQ\napartments in San Jose sold for $97.6 million, or more than $424,000 per unit. The buyer was a joint venture between Ethos Real Estate and Prospect Ridge, and the seller was an affiliate of Stockbridge Capital Group, which acquired the property for $104 million in 2019.\nAn Acacia Capital affiliate bought the Waymark apartment complex in Walnut Creek, dropping $190 million, or nearly $531,000 per unit, for the 358-unit property. Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, the firms that developed the complex, sold the 2022-built property. That deal placed Waymark\u2019s value at 15.1 percent lower than its estimated value of $223.8 million.\nEarlier this month, Sack Capital Partners and Las Palmas Housing bought the 164-unit\nFountain Park\napartments in San Jose for $52 million, or $317,000 per unit. And a Greystar affiliate sold the 948-unit\nPark Kiely\napartment complex in San Jose to Standard Communities, Housing on Merit and Vistria Real Estate for $370 million, or $390,300 per unit. That marked the highest amount paid for a multifamily property in Santa Clara County so far this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Southwestern University quietly cashed in on its vast real estate holdings, fattening its endowment and putting it in the driver\u2019s seat of a 560 acre development set to expand the reach of its campus in Georgetown.\nThe 185-year-old liberal arts school amassed holdings in the thousands of acres \u2014 more than any other private college in Texas \u2014 over the course of decades, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. One tract donated in the 1930s sold for $28 million during the pandemic boom.\nSouthwestern started selling after an audit of its real estate portfolio five years ago, and its endowment has grown $377 million, up from $289 million four years ago, with proceeds largely earmarked for financial aid.\nThe university held back a massive parcel east of campus, where it is advancing plans for a mixed-use district called Southwestern University 560, envisioned as a \u201cmini city\u201d with housing, offices, retail, restaurants, a boutique hotel, cultural spaces and a concert venue. The City of\nGeorgetown\n, about 30 miles north of Austin, has agreed to build a service center there for 275 city employees.\nSouthwestern tapped Austin-based Banbury Development \u2014 best known for\nco-master-planning\nthe 700-acre Mueller redevelopment in East Austin \u2014 to lead the project. The first phase is slated to hit Georgetown\u2019s\nplanning\ncommission this month, with horizontal infrastructure work targeted for completion by next year.\nThe design process has leaned heavily on community input. A 20-member task force of students, faculty and alumni, along with a packed town hall, pushed for a blend of career-building opportunities, cultural amenities and environmental preservation.\n\nOnly 325 acres will be developed, and 70 acres will remain open as an \u201ceco gateway\u201d with creeks, floodplains and trails.\nLaura Skandera Trombley, president of the university, previously ran Pitzer College and the Huntington Library in California. She framed the project as a chance to cement Southwestern\u2019s unique identity in a fast-growing region, noting that no other liberal arts college in the United States has this type of opportunity.\nGreg Weaver, CEO of Banbury, said the mixed-use development could attract unique retail and corporate headquarters.\nWilliamson County has been one of the\nhottest\ngrowth markets in Texas, and corporate tenants are already scouting for campus-like settings with retail and residential built in. The 560 could be a financial engine and a recruiting tool for Southwestern University as well \u2014 a town-and-gown experiment at a metropolitan scale.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Weeks ago\nThe Real Deal\nbroke the story that a\ndeal\nto sell the Brookfield-owned EY Plaza to Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld fell through, putting the\nnon-preforming loan\ntied to the 920,000-square-foot tower back on the market.\nThen came our scoop that a deal for 811 Wilshire also fell out, leaving Jamison in default and facing\nforeclosure\non the 337,000-square-foot property.\nThere\u2019s no telling what next week will bring \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned to TRD, as usual \u2014 but it does appear that local Jamison is in better shape than global Brookfield as far as the two downtown L.A. property values go. The debt connected to 811 Wilshire stands at about $35 million, compared to the original $39 million note that matured and moved to special servicing last year. Jamison bought the property in the early 2000s for $26.5 million. It was valued at $68 million when the current loan was originated in 2014, and it\u2019s been appraised at $40.5 million more recently.\nEY Plaza, on the other hand, fell out of its deal with Carolwood at $130 million. That explains why the $275 million note on the property is being marketed at a discount.\nBackup plan for Original Pantry?\nLeo Pustilnikov of Builders Remedy fame \u2014 AKA the guy who beat the Beverly Hills NIMBY crowd \u2014 might have a backup plan if his out-of-blue buy of the Original Pantry just up Figueroa from LA Live leaves him disenchanted with the restaurant business.\nPustilnikov told KABC Radio\u2019s Frank Mottek on the day of his reported $5.5 million deal for the recently shuttered restaurant \u2014 a longstanding asset in late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan\u2019s portfolio \u2014 that it\u2019s a pure dining play.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming back, the workers are coming back, the Pantry is coming back,\u201d touted the eclectic Pustilnikov, who also has significant holdings of commercial real estate from Huntington Beach to Skid Row.\n\nPustilnikov can look about a block away for a different potential for the prime location the Original Pantry occupies at 9th Street and Fig \u2014 and note that 9th Street is known as James M. Wood Boulevard for a stretch just east of Figueroa. By any name, however, Pustilnikov can hardly miss the 2.3-acre open patch of land at 9th and Francisco streets, especially now that it\u2019s got a\nprice tag\nof $100 million.\nThe land, owned by nonprofit Salvation Army, spans 832 and 900 James M. Wood Boulevard and 916 and 927 Francisco Street, plus another commercial parcel. It\u2019s near LA Live, two Marriott-branded hotels, the Grammy Museum and Los Angeles Convention Center.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Catherine Bassick holds the private listing that is described as entitled to become a \u201cskyline-defining landmark,\u201d in sales materials. There\u2019s no height limit, so that could be true.\nThe land could become a mixed-use residential tower with retail space and rooftop amenities, or a hotel or a creative campus for corporate headquarters, if the buyer goes with any of the scenarios laid out in the sales materials.\nAbout that bonus\nA couple months ago, Hudson Pacific Properties announced it was cutting two board members, who the company said voluntarily resigned.\n\u201cThis more efficient board structure maintains the experience needed to guide our management team while contributing to our ongoing focus on corporate costs to drive value creation for shareholders,\u201d chief executive and chairman Victor Coleman said.\nThat\u2019s the same Coleman who made about $25 million in total compensation, a substantial boost compared to the $8 million or so he made the year before. As\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n, his base salary remained at $1 million, but his discretionary and non-discretionary cash bonuses and stock awards increased to encourage retention, stockholder alignment and stock price recovery. His stock awards were valued at about $22 million. That was despite ballooning losses that have only\ncontinued to mount\nand shares trading under $3.\n",

The loans matured last year, and the firm owed $10.7 million in interest as of last month.\nThe firm\u2019s co-founders, Jon and Ashley Venetos, personally guaranteed the loans, meaning they could be on the hook to pay if their firm can\u2019t cough up the dough.\nLurin lost 12 properties to foreclosure in Florida earlier this year, when Acore Capital Mortgage foreclosed on $383.6 million in loans and auctioned off the property. The firm is also poised to lose the 592-unit Estates at Avenstar in Houston, which\nhit the auction block\nearlier this month, after the firm defaulted on a $52.5 million mortgage from Nexstar.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\n\nThe new Texas law aimed at reforming the use of \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporations in affordable housing deals drew a lawsuit,\nas predicted\n. The Texas Workforce Housing Coalition\nsued in a challenge to the constitutionality\nof House Bill 21. The coalition argued the law retroactively imposes stricter standards on existing agreements, violating the Texas Constitution, and putting current tax exemptions at risk before the law takes effect in 2027. Critics of HB 21 claim it overreaches and undermines local control, while supporters see it as a necessary fix to prevent abuse of tax exemptions.\nAres Real Estate\nswooped into Fort Worth\nwith a massive industrial acquisition. It bought 1.6 million square feet of warehouse space across Tarrant County, including properties in Arlington, Fort Worth and Northlake. The fully leased assets, located along key logistics corridors, will be managed by Ares Industrial Management and are part of the Los Angeles-based firm\u2019s push into high-demand markets.\nTexas lawmakers\u2019 recent ban on certain foreign buyers has\nchilled Chinese homebuying\nin the state. The law targets buyers who aren\u2019t legal U.S. residents, from countries deemed security threats, including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, but it has led to panic selling and buyer hesitation among legal residents.\nAustin\u2019s\nglut of office sublease availability\n, including Meta\u2019s full-building offering for Sixth and Guadalupe, has stuck around for years now.\nA prominent Austin broker turned to HGTV to market an unusual listing. @properties Lone Star\u2019s Katie Jackson presented the\nBouldin Treehouse at 801 Post Oak Street\n, listed for $1.6 million as a redevelopment opportunity, on the show \u201cZillow Gone Wild.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The prototypical Silicon Valley commercial developer and the AI chipmaker driving the region\u2019s next big phase continue to pair up for a generational swap meet, with the former cashing eight- and nine-figure checks on a regular basis and the latter getting office complexes around the South Bay city of Santa Clara.\nThe long-established developer is Mountain View-based Sobrato, which began to make its distinctive mark on the commercial landscape of Silicon Valley in the 1950s, when Bill Hewlett and David Packard were still giving rise to the notion of a global innovation hub clustered around Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto.\nSobrato went on to develop hundreds of millions of commercial space in the area. It more recently has sold off more than $400 million worth of its portfolio to Nvidia. The chipmaker\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed more than 10-fold in the past three years, with the AI boom driving its market capitalization past $4 trillion, helping finance the growth that has prompted the recent buying binge on office properties.\nThe latest exhibit of the trend came last week when Nvidia added\n2701 San Tomas Expressway\nto its hometown portfolio for $83.2 million. Sobrato sold the 125,000-square-foot building, which was developed with three other buildings that form an office complex at the Santa Clara site.\nOther recent sales by Sobrato to Nvidia include a May deal for the three other buildings in the complex on San Tomas Expressway for $254 million. Each structure has about 125,000 square feet of space, and all four buildings are situated around Nvidia\u2019s headquarters at 2788 San Tomas Expressway.\nAlso in May, Nvidia\nbought a 10-building\n, 13-acre office and research campus from Sobrato at 2348 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, across the street from its HQ, for $123 million. In July, it purchased another property at 2740 Scott Boulevard, adjacent to the four-building office complex, for $4.5 million.\nSobrato\u2019s take of more than $400 million indicates the developer is tops on dollar volume when it comes to property sales to Nvidia, but Prelock Holdings appears to take the cake for biggest single deal. Los Angeles-based Preylock got $374 million from the chipmaker in May 2024 for its 557,000-square foot\nheadquarters\nlast year.\nThe newest new \u2018normal\u2019\nBreak out the air quotes because housing prices in San Francisco have returned to \u201cnormal.\u201d\nAt least that\u2019s the analysis of real estate brokerage\nRedfin\n. The firm published a report noting that\nhousing prices in the city\nare back at July 2018 levels \u2014 the last time the city\u2019s real estate market could be defined as \u201cnormal.\u201d\nTo make its calculations, Redfin used a mortgage payment-to-income ratio, coming to the estimate that homes now cost about as much as they did before the pandemic relative to residents\u2019 annual income.\nThe median home price in San Francisco has increased 8 percent since July 2018 \u2014 a stark difference from the national median price surging 56 percent over the same time period. Annual household incomes in San Francisco have grown 7.7 percent, nearly double the 3.9 percent yearly increase across the country.\nAcross the Bay, Oakland isn\u2019t far behind in returning to so-called normalcy. The East Bay city is poised to return to \u201cnormal\u201d housing prices this month if prices remain stable or decline. By contrast, no other metro area in the U.S. is expected to reach \u201cnormal\u201d levels until Austin in March 2027.\nUsing the same 6.7 percent mortgage rate calculation, Sacramento will return to \u201cnormal\u201d in November 2028, San Diego in February 2029 and San Jose in May 2029. The projections don\u2019t consider property taxes or insurance costs for California homeowners more heavily.\nResidents in Orange County are seemingly out of luck, with no return to \u201cnormal\u201d expected there, according to Redfin\u2019s calculations. Home prices in much of OC have gone up by so much that it would be virtually impossible to return to pre-pandemic levels, even over the next decade.\nOceanwide finds a buyer\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Oceanwide Center, the similarly abandoned sibling of Los Angeles\u2019\nOceanwide Plaza\n, appears to have found a buyer.\nDan Kingsley, co-founder of Bay Area development firm SKS Partners, is in contract to buy the development at 50 First Street. Kingsley and private equity alum Jay Yang are reportedly in talks with Haitong International, a lender on the project that\nseized it in 2021\nfrom developer Oceanwide Holdings.\nWhen construction began on the project in 2016, the goal was to build two high-rises with offices, condominiums and a high-end hotel and complete construction in 2020. The 2-million-square-foot project came to a halt after Oceanwide Holdings\u2019 financial issues and debt became impossible to overcome. The total cost of the development effort was valued at $1.6 billion.\nThe long gap since any work has been done on the project means that Iingsley and Yang, or another buyer would have to apply for permit renewals with the Department of Building Inspection even if they choose to stick with the current entitlements on the property.\nA curious CEQA proposal\nCalifornia lawmakers are seeking an\noddly specific legislative carveout\nin Santa Barbara.\nThe newly introduced Senate Bill 158 calls for subjecting any project within a city of more than 85,000 but fewer than 95,000 residents and within a county of between 440,000 and 455,000 people to undergo environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, which received a\nmajor overhaul in July\nas exemptions for environmental reviews were expanded. The bill also aims to prevent CEQA exemptions to any projects next to a wetland, a creek and a state-registered historical landmark, as well as any projects larger than four acres and those that use\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\nfor development.\nThat criteria narrows it down to just one project in the whole state: A 270-unit, eight-story residential building proposed for construction behind Santa Barbara\u2019s historic Old Mission.\nThe district is represented by Sen. Monique Lim\u00f3n, the incoming leader of the State Senate. Lim\u00f3n denied that she\u2019s out to prevent the development with the legislation.\nMore multifamily properties trade hands\nYet another multifamily property in San Jose has traded hands.\nThe 230-unit\nLINQ apartments\nat 1700 Newbury Park Drive sold to a joint venture between Ethos Real Estate and Prospect Ridge for $97.6 million. The seller was an affiliate of Stockbridge Capital Group, which acquired the property for about $104 million in 2019.\nThe complex is near San Jose\u2019s Berryessa BART station, which is set to transform with new commercial and residential developments surrounding the station. The progress of\nSB 79\nin the state legislature could boost further development around transit hubs throughout the Bay Area if passed.\nMeanwhile, in Walnut Creek, Acacia Capital bought the 358-unit\nWaymark apartment complex\nat 101 Pringle Avenue for $190 million. The sellers were Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, the firms that developed the complex. The purchase price was 15.1 percent below Waymark\u2019s estimated value of the property of $223.8 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "From luxury North Shore homes trading at steep discounts to zoning battles in Fulton Market and a lawsuit in the Loop, Chicago\u2019s real estate scene moved through a few scrapes and bold bets this week.\nA\nlakefront Kenilworth estate once listed for $14 million\nsold for just $6.8 million Thursday. With the new owners planning to demolish the 11,000-square-foot mansion on 1.6 acres along Sheridan Road, the deal highlights that even in exclusive areas, buyers are looking for move-in ready properties.\nElsewhere on the North Shore, Highland Park boxed out the\nself-storage investor who rebounded Michael Jordan\u2019s former mansion\nat a huge discount. The new owner, John Cooper, had intended to convert the estate into a\ntimeshare-like property, offering a one-week annual stay\nof \u201cChampions Point\u201d for $1 million. However, local authorities\nbanned timeshares in the town\nthis week, leaving Cooper with a high-value property that now looks more like a conventional resale than a reinvented business model.\nTurbulence continues to jolt Chicago\u2019s affordable housing system. The\nChicago Housing Authority lost another senior executive this week\n, with HR chief Dominick Maniscalco walking away for a job with Milwaukee Public Schools. He\u2019s the ninth top CHA official to depart in a year, and the agency remains\nwithout a permanent CEO amid a delay to the appointment\nof Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s choice to fill the role, former alderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n\nIn Fulton Market, deals and disputes are heating up. Waterton paid\n$89.5 million for The Mason\n, a 263-unit rental tower at 180 North Ada Street, removing one option for investors out of a\nlong list of Chicago multifamily assets\ncurrently listed for sale.\nJust a few blocks away,\nDomus Real Estate Group has to push harder\n. Its plan for a 30-story, 347-unit tower at 215 North Racine is colliding with city zoning limits. Domus wants to pump the floor-area ratio to 24 times the size of the lot \u2014\na bold ask\nby Fulton Market standards. Officials suggested additional land acquisition to soften the bonus density, but neighbors worry that the next chapter for the corridor could look less like loft conversions and more like Loop towers.\nThere\u2019s always action in the Loop, where a fight is brewing that involves city subsidies going into the\nLaSalle Street Reimagined\noffice-to-residential conversion program.\nCeladon Partners is sparring with its ex-partner Primera Group\n, alleging it got cut out of a deal to turn much of the Clark Adams Building into apartments, underscoring how developer alliances can quickly turn contentious.\nIn the southwest suburbs,\nJSB Capital Group\nwrapped up a\n$65 million multifamily purchase\nthat helped end a messy legal fight between Kansas City-based lender 7 Acre Investments and the developer of the property in New Lenox. JSB bought Lincoln Station, a 220-unit complex, after its builder Richard Gammonley, allegedly defaulted on a rescue capital loan from 7 Acre.\nAnd in\nChicago\u2019s Pullman neighborhood\n, the city approved a $30 million Hampton by Hilton project, bringing 101 hotel rooms to the Far South Side with the first lodging development in the area in decades. The hotel is being touted as more than just a project: it\u2019s a marker of outside capital finally staking a claim in an area long overlooked by mainstream development.",

        "content": "The lecturing came hot and heavy this week.\nGovernment leaders took\nHuntington\nBeach and Artesia to task as the state cracks down on jurisdictions that can\u2019t \u2014 some might say won\u2019t \u2014 get in compliance with housing laws.\nGov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta claimed victory on Friday, when a California court of appeals ruled in their favor, forcing\nHuntington Beach\nto get a compliant housing element done in 120 days.\nThe Orange County city locked horns with the state a few years ago after failing to approve plans that outline how it will address housing needs in the long term across income levels in what\u2019s known as a housing element.\n\u201cToday\u2019s win is an important development,\u201d Bonta said of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cHuntington Beach is running out of excuses, and the consequences for failing to plan for its fair share of housing are becoming clearer and more serious.\u201d\nThe lecturing followed Artesia\u2019s settlement with the state on Tuesday. After falling out of compliance by not having a housing element completed in 2023, the city now has until January to figure out how it\u2019ll accommodate 1,069 more housing units.\nNewsom accused Artesia of \u201cwasted time and money,\u201d while California Department of Housing and Community Development Director Gustavo Velasquez brought up cities\u2019 \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d when it comes to housing in the Huntington Beach ruling.\nSome local jurisdictions say they are struggling to meet the housing targets while balancing local and state regulations around development.\nMorality and legal compliance. They\u2019re two different conversations happening in the context of a single subject. As is so often the case, that leaves little room for common ground.\n\u2026 and cue builder\u2019s remedy\nA builder\u2019s remedy project in\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nresulted in several years of litigation, but the city backed down from its fight in March, after a judge ordered the town to post a $14 million bond if it wanted to continue fighting against Cedar Street Partners\u2019 mixed-use project at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\nPlans call for about 7,200 square feet of office and 80 dwelling units, of which eight would be affordable and 16 for hospitality. The firm is seeking development entitlements at city hall as well as $6 million in legal costs in court.\nCedar Street managing member Jonathan Curtis called the city\u2019s development pushback \u201cbewildering.\u201d Whether the project is now on a fast track to getting approvals remains to be seen. It\u2019s set to go before the planning commission on Sept. 18 and city council Oct. 2.\n\nBond Street\u2019s shakeup\nDavid Parnes and James Harris\n, founders of the Bond Street Partners team at Carolwood Estates, are splitting as business partners.\nDetails on what will happen with the nine other agents on their team or if the Bond Street name will be dissolved are not yet known. The two declined to say anything beyond their prepared Instagram message.\nThe announcement, they said, marks the \u201cnext chapter\u201d for their business, one that\u2019s swelled in recent years to make Bond Street RealTrends\u2019 No. 1-ranked medium team in the U.S. with $940 million in volume.\nLuka snags Sharapova\u2019s pad\nOceanfront neighborhood The Strand gets all the attention, but how about that Hill Section? That\u2019s where Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\npaid $25 million for tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s custom build.\nCarolwood Estate\u2019s Sus\u00e2n Perryman was the listing agent, and it appears the property traded off market.\nThe purchase price pushed past 1800 The Strand to be Manhattan Beach\u2019s most expensive home sale ever. The Strand property claimed the record last July when the beachfront property sold for $24.5 million.\nBrad Pitt retools property portfolio, again\nTwo-time Oscar winner\nBrad Pitt\nshuffled the deck on his real estate holdings yet again.\nThe actor sold his Los Feliz home, known locally as The Steel House, in an off-market deal on Friday. Sources told\nTRD\nthe asking price was $5.5 million. What the home actually closed at is not yet known. If the purchase price was less than $5.3 million, Pitt will have managed to bypass paying the contentious Measure ULA two-tier tax on real estate deals.\nPitt\u2019s agents Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays of Carolwood Estates represented the A-lister in his latest trade.\n",

        "content": "Four years after the Surfside condo collapse, families of the 98 people who died still don\u2019t know why the building toppled. It will be at least another year before they get answers.\nThis means the Champlain Towers South investigation will take longer than the probes into the collapse of the Florida International University pedestrian bridge in 2018 and the\nWorld Trade Center twin towers\nin 2001. With more than $40 million allocated so far, the Surfside investigation also is costlier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years, 98 dead. And there\u2019s no answers and no accountability,\u201d Martin Langesfeld, whose sister and brother-in-law died in the collapse, told Surfside commissioners on Tuesday.\nLangesfeld\u2019s comments came hours after the National Institute of Standards and Technology presented its preliminary findings.\nSo far, evidence shows the collapse beginning in the pool deck, which started to cave in at least\nseven minutes\nbefore the tower toppled. Investigators said the pool deck\u2019s design wasn\u2019t up to code, and slab reinforcements weren\u2019t placed per design requirements. Nearly all of the deck\u2019s construction joints didn\u2019t have steel reinforcement dowels, and the concrete \u201ckeys\u201d in the joints were either improperly built or missing, NIST\u2019s Glenn Bell said. This could have allowed for water to seep in, leading to corrosion and cracking of slab reinforcements.\nInvestigators also outlined a slew of issues that appeared at\nChamplain\nbefore the collapse. Hours before the tragedy, a water drip turned into a \u201cfaucet,\u201d investigators said, likely referring to a\nwidely circulated video\nthat shows water gushing into the underground garage. Weeks before that, a gate between the pool deck and street-level parking deck jammed, and about a month prior, a sliding glass door came off its tracks.\nNotably, the location of some of these issues coincides with the placement of improperly built construction joints, investigators said.\nNIST, which originally expected to release its final report this year, says draft reports will be submitted next year.\n\u201cWe share the public\u2019s desire to have answers,\u201d said NIST\u2019s Judith Mitrani-Reiser, \u201cand what we can do to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nNIST, in a statement, said it \u201cshared from the beginning of this investigation that it would be especially complex, given the lack of any obvious cause, such as a fire or plane crash.\u201d\nBut the delays are frustrating and painful to family members.\nLangesfeld agreed that the investigation is vital for the safety of condo residents across Florida. Someone has to answer for the failures at Champlain, he added.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy requires criminal accountability. Who developed and constructed this building? Who approved this building? There are many potential parties that must be investigated,\u201d he told town commissioners. \u201cThis was not a natural disaster, this was not a hurricane. This was a preventable human error.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMichael Shvo sold one Miami Beach development site in a deal we heard was close to the amount of the loan backing the property. He is still trying to\nhang onto\nthe Raleigh assemblage. What\u2019s going on with his One Soundscape Park property? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Ex-Apple CEO John Sculley and his wife, Diane, sold an oceanfront estate at\n1214 North Ocean Boulevard\nin Palm Beach for $37 million. The buyer was Chestnut Park Holdings LLC.\nCommercial\n: The purchase price for the Bikini Hostel at 1247 West Avenue, scooped up by Michael Stern\u2019s JDS and David Martin\u2019s Terra, hit records this week, coming in at $20 million. The acquisition was part of a\nlarger, $120 million development site\nthat includes the bulk purchase of Bay Garden Manor at 1250 West Avenue, where the developers plan to construct a waterfront condo tower.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe oceanfront estate at 1610 North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach\nhit the market\nfor $65 million. The nearly 9,800-square-foot mansion, with six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms, was built in 2018 on a 0.9-acre lot. It\u2019s on the market with Margit Brandt of Premier Estate Properties. Records show it last sold in 2019 for $25.5 million.\nObituaries\nLast week, we reported on the death of Douglas Elliman agent\nDarin Tansey\n, who was found dead at his condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach, at the age of 50. We also learned that\nDanny Zelonker\n, a commercial broker who focused on industrial real estate, died in August. He was 75.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA Florida appeals court struck down the state\u2019s decades-old ban on openly carrying firearms, citing recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings,\nPolitico\nreports. The ruling reverses prior precedent and could have major implications for gun laws and tourism in the state.\nThe Miami-Dade School Board voted to sue South Florida Public Media Group, which manages the public radio station WLRN, over its $6.5 million purchase of a station in West Palm Beach,\nWLRN\nreports.\nThe Z Ocean Hotel in South Beach was shut down after months of unpaid electricity bills, prompting the Miami Beach Fire Department to evacuate the building even though it was already vacant. It\u2019s unclear if the closure is temporary or permanent, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.",

        "content": "Fashion week in New York City is a stressful time for designers showcasing their latest lines in the hopes that shoppers will buy what they\u2019re selling.\nBut fashion designer Jill Stuart has already cashed in on her latest product \u2014 a Soho penthouse, which she sold for $15 million, according to public records filed with the city this week.\nStuart bought the condo for $11.2 million in 2007, and was originally seeking $24.5 million when it hit the market in July 2023. The home underwent a series of price cuts and was last asking $16 million when it went into contract in June, according to StreetEasy.\nModlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Compass\u2019 Nick Gavin shared the listing.\nCompleted in 2005, the 12-story, 40-unit building at 330 Spring Street was\narchitect Philip Johnson\n\u2019s last project before his death.\nWith interiors designed by Annabelle Selldorf, the full-floor five-bedroom features two terraces totaling almost 1,600 square feet and 360-degree exposures from floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. From a private elevator landing, a foyer leads into the open-layout living and dining rooms, which are separated from a western media room.\nAn eat-in kitchen with two islands, two full-size fridges and a wine fridge is on the eastern side of the unit. The western and southern sides of the penthouse hold bedroom suites that can be closed off from public areas. Four of the five bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms; two of the bedroom suites share jack-and-jill bathrooms, each with a soaking tub and stall shower.\n\nThe primary suite has its own terrace, a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom with a soaking tub and double vanity.\nStuart is not the first artful resident in the striking building, which was named in homage to Johnson\u2019s original Glass Building in New Canaan, Conn. Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic purchased a two-bedroom condo for\n$2.65 million in 2013\n.\nStuart, who has been spending more time in Paris per a friend quoted in the New York Post, also sold her Sagaponack estate for\n$9.4 million in 2023\n. The 5,000-square-foot farmhouse sat on a 1.6-acre property, which came with a pool house with its own gym, a gas fire pit, Jacuzzi and four-car garage.\nStuart, whose parents owned a sportswear brand that dressed celebrities like Natalie Wood and Lucille Ball in the 1960s and 1970s, attended the prestigious Dalton School in the city and sold her first collection of accessories while there at the age of 15 to Bloomingdale\u2019s.\nHer fashion empire later expanded rapidly, and she has dressed celebrities like Kerry Washington, Elizabeth Banks and Jessica Biel.\nThe recent sales still may be of help to Stuart, who claimed in court that her now ex-husband lost $25 million mishandling a family trust.\n",

        "content": "For about three years, New York affordable housing developers had access to a program that gave them a little wiggle room when things were tight. Now, that program has been paused, and its chances of returning are slim.\nThe program, called Section 610, allowed landlords to collect the full value of a federal rent voucher when it was more than the rent. But money came from the federal Section 8 program.\nIn March, when Section 8 funding appeared in jeopardy, the city\npaused authorizations\n. In July, New York State\u2019s housing department seemed to put the final nail in the coffin, ending authorizations for landlords who receive certain city subsidies.\nAdvocates for affordable housing developers and landlords are looking to both federal and local authorities to fund the program as expenses grow.\nDiminishing collections, rising costs\nSamantha Magistro, CEO at affordable housing developer Bronx Pro Group, has applied to the program for 15 different projects. Her first 10 requests were granted, giving her portfolio some room to breathe. But her most recent five requests have yet to be processed.\nMagistro, who chairs the board of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, said her concern is for smaller and nonprofit developers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have this really important tool to help increase income and help them pay the most important bills,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your expenses are more than your income, it\u2019s hard to spend on that extra paint job or do all the repairs that an owner might want to do.\u201d\nLaunched in 2022, Section 610 was aimed at projects facing financial difficulties. Certain building owners who had agreements with the city to limit rent could demonstrate financial need.\u00a0 With a Section 610 authorization, they could amend their agreements upon lease renewal to collect the full amount of a federal voucher, without changing costs for tenants.\nAt Bronx Pro Group, that made a difference. Expenses have risen sharply, especially in insurance costs. Rent collections have been more sporadic than expected. Projects were underwritten with the assumption they would collect 95 percent of the rent, a conservative projection before 2020. Now, collections stand around 93 percent, Magistro said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for close to 25 years, and my father longer before that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve seen our portfolio really distressed.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s older projects were less able to withstand those expense and income shocks. Magistro can still collect the full voucher amount on those buildings where her applications were already approved.\n\n\u201cWe feel pretty confident that 610 is going to help us support getting those portfolios out of financial distress,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very proactive.\u201d\nBut newer buildings in the portfolio can struggle too, faced with a difficult interest rate environment and unexpectedly low collections.\n\u201cMost affordable housing developers are mission-based,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us aren\u2019t looking for some kind of boondoggle profit here, but we are looking to make sure that we can operate sufficiently and be compensated for the work that we do.\u201d\nSolutions stuck in bureaucracy\nFederal budget negotiations are deadlocked in Congress, which has until September 30 to avoid a government shutdown. The Senate has proposed raising funding for Section 8 by about 4 percent, while the House has proposed flat funding.\nUnless funding for Section 8 is increased during federal budget negotiations, Section 610 is unlikely to be revived. Even flat funding, which is typical for short-term funding bills, may not be enough to bring back authorizations, said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference.\n\u201cAs rents go up, if you don\u2019t add additional appropriation, you\u2019re serving fewer households,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really at the mercy of what happens in Washington.\u201d\nSome have been looking for solutions closer to home.\nThe New York Apartment Association has been lobbying for a state pilot program that would allow owners of rent-stabilized housing to collect full voucher amounts when they\u2019re more than the legal rent, according to executive vice president Jay Martin. The expansion would incentivize landlords to rent out vacant apartments and specifically to tenants with vouchers, who they otherwise might avoid. The provisions was included in a state senate bill\nintroduced in March\n, but is still in committee.\n\u201cIt was a proposal that we thought was going to get broad support and build off the momentum of 610,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did not move.\u201d\nIf New York wants to address housing challenges, he said, it needs to fund solutions.\n\u201cWe keep telling property owners and, obviously, these poor people in shelters that getting them into permanent housing is the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we try to do it on the cheap.\u201d\n",

Cawley Partners recently\nacquired\nSouth Creek Ranch and plans to build data centers, manufacturing and logistics on the former cattle operation. Undeveloped ranches often become profitable as\nhunting destinations\nif they can\u2019t sustain cattle operations.\nImprovements on the Two Rivers include a manager\u2019s house, several stocked tanks, a shooting range, a new shop and a four-bedroom main house fronting a creek that runs through the property.\n",

        "content": "A local development team pulled together nearly $100 million to build an apartment tower in the West Loop, one of the few major ground-up projects moving forward in Chicago\u2019s otherwise sluggish multifamily pipeline.\nA joint venture of Focus Development, Melrose Ascension Capital and DAC Developments scored $71.6 million in construction financing from CIBC and $23.9 million in preferred equity from Heitman, , Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The partners plan a 19-story, 287-unit building at 1221 West Washington Boulevard, just south of Fulton Market.\nThe $96 million package is a rare win in a market where high interest rates and rising costs have stalled downtown projects. The development was initially pegged at $100 million when proposed in 2021. Tim Anderson, CEO of Focus, said landing debt and equity wasn\u2019t easy, but he said Chicago\u2019s apartment fundamentals are compelling, as the market has strong demand and a lack of supply.\nDesigned with smaller-format units, the glass-and-brick tower will target renters priced out of Fulton Market\u2019s\nluxury\nstock. Rents are expected to start at $1,800 a month. The project will also include 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and is slated for completion in late 2026.\n\nThe deal marks only the second major downtown resi development to secure financing in more than a year. Vista Property Group\nbroke\nthat drought in May with $173 million for a 31-story tower at 370 North Morgan Street. With deliveries thin until at least 2027, Class A landlords downtown are enjoying leverage: average net rents jumped 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nFocus is a\nveteran\nFulton Market player, having co-developed The Parker apartments and 167 North Green Street\u2019s office tower. Its partners are also busy downtown: DAC and MAC recently started construction on a separate 19-story South Loop rental project with a\njoint\n$69 million construction loan.\nFor the West Loop, the tower adds to a neighborhood buzzing with office-to-residential conversions and corporate relocations. Anderson called Fulton Market \u201cthe most desirable neighborhood in Chicago right now,\u201d a claim that lenders and equity partners appear to be warming up to.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Earlier this summer, a penthouse at the building asking\n$34 million\nfinally landed a buyer after\n\n10 years on the market.\nCorcoran\u2019s Nick Riback, Patrick Rukai and Reid Lacognata had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to enter contract was a condo at the Naftali Group\u2019s 255 East 77th Street, with an asking price of $8.5 million. Unit 28B spans 2,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nThe apartment was one of 44 of the building\u2019s 62 units to find buyers since sales launched last October. Amenities in the tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern, include a garage, fitness center, pool and porte-cochere.\nA team with Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, led by Alexa Lambert, is heading sales at the Lenox Hill property.\nOf the 11 properties, seven were condos, three were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $70 million, for an average price of $6.4 million and a median of $5.4 million. The typical home spent nearly 250 days on the market and was discounted 4 percent from the original listing price.\n",

First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company took over the loan following SVB\u2019s collapse in 2023.\nThe debts include an $11.8 million loan backed by the 159-room Hotel North Beach at 935 Kearny Street and a $14.8 million debt tied to the apartment building at 1499 California Street. The California Street building, rising four stories with 89 units, is reportedly listed for sale at $13 million, or $146,000 per unit.\nIt\u2019s the latest series of loan defaults for San Francisco-based Mosser Companies. Early last year, the firm defaulted on a 2018 loan for $88 million tied to 12 buildings and 459 apartments. A joint venture between The Swig Company and Mosser also defaulted on a $68 million loan tied to five apartment buildings in San Francisco.\n\nLast year, Mosser Companies exited its Financial District headquarters at 220 Montgomery Street after being\nserved an eviction notice\nby landlord Swig. After that, it\nlisted five apartment properties with 173 units\nin Oakland. In 2021, Mosser was sued by tenants in Oakland alleging illegal utility fees and shutoffs and called the landlord a \u201cserial evictor,\u201d the outlet said.\nThe Mosser Companies affiliates have at least 90 days to take care of the default before the lender could serve the firm a notice of potential foreclosure auction. The borrowers could reach a mutual agreement with the lender, including selling the properties to recoup some of the debt.\nMosser owns and operates at least 40 apartment buildings in San Francisco and other properties in Oakland and Los Angeles as of last year. Earlier this summer, a Mosser affiliate\nsold another Nob Hill apartment building\nat 1060 Bush Street for $16.5 million after defaulting on its JPMorgan-issued loan linked to the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nathan Berman is cooking up his next office-to-residential conversion, taking his prodigious spirit to Third Avenue.\nMetro Loft Management filed plans with the Department of Buildings for a residential project at 675 Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. It\u2019s a significant sign of progress coming less than six months after Metro Loft\u2019s partner in the project, David Werner Real Estate Investments, acquired the site from the Durst Organization for $100 million.\nThe conversion plans call for a 464-unit building \u2014 more expansive than previous reports of roughly 430 units \u2014 spanning 321,000 square feet, including retail space on the ground floor. The property would be slightly taller than the office building that stood on the site, leaping from 31 to 35 stories.\nDemolition work is underway at the site, but Metro Loft has not provided a concrete timeline on the project. Werner could not be reached for comment by the outlet.\nThe DOB filing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\n\nIn April, Ron Eliasaf\u2019s Northwind Group handed Werner\na $90 million loan\nfor the acquisition and predevelopment of 675 Third. The 340,000-square-foot office building was roughly two-thirds occupied at the time of sale.\nBerman\u2019s firm is one of the conversion kings of Manhattan and Werner is a frequent ally in his projects. The two are partners at 235 East 42nd Street, where they are redeveloping the former Pfizer headquarters into 1,500 rental units, representing the largest office-to-residential conversion in New York City.\nThe project ran into a brief stumble last month when\nsmoke\nbillowed out of the construction site, briefly sidelining workers. Metro Loft said there was no actual fire, but the New York Fire Department did respond to the scene.\nConstruction is expected to wrap the last quarter of 2027. The property, which will feature a mix of luxury rentals and affordable housing through the 467m tax abatement program, will include more than 100,000 square feet of amenities and 30,000 square feet of retail space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Blackstone\u2019s purchase price for the 352-key East Miami hotel in Brickell is revealed as $147.8 million.\nFunds affiliated with New York-based Blackstone bought the 40-story hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza from funds managed by Honolulu, Hawaii-based Trinity Investments and New York-based Certares, the sellers announced in a news release last week, declining to disclose the price. The sale\nclosed\nlast week and deeds became public on Friday.\nThe deal breaks down to $419,886 per key.\nEast Miami is within the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex that Miami-based Swire Properties completed in 2016. The complex, which spans about five city blocks, also has about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; and a pair of office buildings.\nEast Miami is home to rooftop venue Sugar and has 89 serviced apartments.\nTrinity and Certares bought the hotel from Swire in 2021 for $174 million. The price recorded in the deed for that deal was $120.3 million. Deeds generally reflect the price of the real estate and exclude furniture and fixtures, which usually are purchased with hotels.\nThe true price of the most recent East Miami sale also could be more than the $147.8 million recorded in the deed if furniture and fixtures were to be included.\n\nBlackstone, an alternative asset management giant led by CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, had about $1.2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, according to its website.\nIt\u2019s been active in South Florida recently. This summer, Blackstone and its industrial arm, Link Logistics, sold a 43.7-acre development site for offices and warehouses at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road in Opa-locka for\n$105.7 million\n. The deal brought the sellers\u2019 South Florida sales since November to more than $1 billion.\nBlackstone paid\n$115.9 million\nfor the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes in April, and also provided a\n$300 million\nloan in May for Karim Alibhai\u2019s Gencom and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group\u2019s renovation of the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne at 455 Grand Bay Drive, and planned renovation of the Grand Bay Club at 425 Grand Bay Drive in Key Biscayne.\nBrickell\nemerged as the epicenter of South Florida\u2019s real estate boom, attracting many new-to-market firms expanding to the tri-county region as well as condo developments.\nThe East Miami trade marks the latest sale of a portion of\nBrickell City Centre\n.\nIn June, Swire sold its 75 percent stake in the retail and parking portion at the complex to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n. After canceling a planned office supertall on a 2.8-acre Brickell City Centre development site, Swire sold the property to Melo Group for\n$200 million\nin May.\nAlso, Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International paid\n$45 million\nfor a nearly 1-acre development site at 9 Southeast Sixth Street at Brickell City Centre last month. The site is proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys. Kerzner hasn\u2019t revealed its planned project.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is turning to the courts to secure a key piece of land for its $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nCity attorneys filed a condemnation lawsuit this week against Charter DMN Holdings, a firm controlled by developer\nRay Washburne\n, after failed negotiations over a 36,000-square-foot parcel near Young and Houston streets, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The site sits next to the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street, which the city purchased from Washburne\nearlier\nthis summer for $45.1 million.\nWashburne told the outlet that he\u2019s willing to sell but\nnoted\nthat a long-term ground lease with broadcaster WFAA complicates matters.\nThe disputed lot is a smaller, adjacent parcel, now a parking lot between the newspaper\u2019s former garage and WFAA\u2019s studio. The city council previously authorized up to $6.5 million to purchase it. That April resolution also cleared the way for eminent domain if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached, laying the groundwork for this week\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe city\u2019s $3 billion convention center overhaul, slated to open in 2029, requires more land to accommodate the Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s planned widening of Interstate 30, rail line upgrades and design changes to avoid building over active tracks. Officials last year identified the Dallas Morning News property as essential to fitting the project into downtown\u2019s tight footprint.\nThe city often uses eminent domain for small parcels that don\u2019t make headlines, such as for easements, but it\u2019s less common in high-profile cases.\nWashburne\n, who bought the campus for $28 million in 2019, retained the site\u2019s frontage even after selling the main tract to the city. Earlier this year, he publicly\nfloated\na sale to a data firm, citing frustrations with delays in the city\u2019s planning and prompting the city\u2019s $45.1 million purchase of the property. The city took control of it in June.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The previous week saw\n15 contracts\n\u201410 condos and five houses \u2014 with a total asking volume of $41 million.\u00a0 During the same week last year, just nine luxury contracts were signed in the borough for $27 million.\nThe top contract last week went to Unit 4F at 1 Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights..\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom unit spans 3,200 square feet and came on the market in March, asking $5.75 million, before dropping the price. The seller bought the unit for $2.5 million in 2009, according to public records.\nThe 34-foot-wide great room opens up onto a balcony overlooking Prospect Park. The primary suite features a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom with a soaking spa tub, marble-tiled shower and radiant heated flooring.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Karen Heyman and Alan Heyman had the listing.

It also comes with a shared roof terrace with an outdoor kitchen and grills, billiards room and residents\u2019 lounge.\nThe property previously snagged a top contract last year, when Brooks Brothers CEO Ken Ohashi purchased a penthouse unit in the\nbuilding for $9.45 million\n.\nThe second priciest deal last week went to a combined condo unit at 360 Furman Street in Brooklyn Heights asking $4.5 million.\n\nThe seller purchased Unit 321 in 2012 for $1.2 million before adding Unit 320 in 2018 for $1.9 million.

The building comes with a 24-hour doorman, a 3,000-square-foot fitness center, a yoga studio, parking garage, billiards room, golf simulator and movie theater.\nCombining units at the building has been a popular undertaking.\nIn 2022, hedge fund executive Stuart Leaf sold a 5,040-square-foot apartment that combined\ntwo duplexes for $7.9 million\nin the building. Leaf had previously combined three units at One Brooklyn Bridge Park on the 10th, 11th and 12th floors and listed the mega-spread for a\nrecord-seeking $32 million in 2015\n.\nIn 2022, another seller combined two units, 427 and 428,\nselling them for $4.1 million\n.\nHomes in the borough entering contract last week had an average price per square foot of $1,614 and a median asking price of $2.7 million.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty Corporation is\nopening up its options\nto kick off its stalled redevelopment of the San Francisco Flower Market site.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed an application with the city of San Francisco to tweak its design for its mixed-use project at Sixth and Brannan Streets in Central South of Market, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe firm was approved in 2019 to construct office buildings at the site spanning 2 million square feet. In its new application, Kilroy floated several new variants of its approved plan, all of which remove a 22,000-square-foot child care facility and about 1,000 square feet of community space that were part of the original project. The amount of parking on site and the height of the proposed buildings, however, have increased.\nIn one version of the modified project, Kilroy proposed constructing five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. In this iteration, the buildings would range from 11 to 18 stories tall.\nAnother version of the project would utilize the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes; each structure would rise a maximum height of 500 feet, or up to 49 stories. That version would also include 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\n\nAnother version, the \u201cMixed-Use Variant,\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces. They would be housed across five buildings reaching as high as 480 feet, or 47 stories.\nThe \u201cInstitutional Variant,\u201d meanwhile, proposes building roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings that would top out at a maximum of 270 feet, or 18 stories.\nThe city of San Francisco faces a\nstubborn office vacancy rate\nand desperate need for housing.\nThe old San Francisco Flower Market has since\nrelocated\nto a 125,000 square feet at 901 16th Street in Potrero Hill and opened to customers earlier this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A German property investor is pushing further into the United States real estate market, acquiring a Manhattan property from Acadia Realty Trust.\nPamera North America, the U.S. affiliate of Germany\u2019s Pamera Real Estate Partners GmbH, acquired 640 Broadway in Noho from Westchester-based Acadia for $49.5 million, Bisnow\nreported\n. The deal for the nine-story, 41,000-square-foot building breaks down to $1,207 per square foot.\nThe property features 21 loft-style residences, as well as 4,000 square feet of retail space. The retail tenant roster includes an outpost of the popular Van Leeuwen Ice Cream chain.\nGlosslab, a membership-based manicure and pedicure company, was once a retail tenant at the property. But ownership sued Glosslab for more than $100,000 in unpaid rent and evicted it from the building in July 2024, according to court records.\nJLL represented both sides of the sale transaction.\nAcadia and Winnhaven Group acquired the property in 2012 for $32.5 million. Acadia had a 24.5 percent stake in the joint venture, according to an annual report from last year.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Acadia\nfiled an offering plan\nfor a condominium conversion of the property, once known as the Empire State Building. The plan called for a $135.5 million sellout, an average of about $6.5 million per unit.\nElsewhere in the city, Acadia has been on a buying tear, snapping retail properties in Soho and Williamsburg. Since last fall, the real estate investment has acquired more than $280 million in New York City property alone.\nBased in Munich, Pamera opened its first office stateside a little less than a year ago, planning to target properties in the Big Apple, Boston and the Sun Belt, according to PERE News.\nSince then, the firm has launched its efforts with a $30 million acquisition of a luxury residential property on Crosby Street, as well as deals on the Upper East Side, Denver and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The home entered contract in August with an\nasking price of $14.5 million\n.\nThe home originally hit the market asking $18 million in May 2024 with Brown Harris Stevens.\nThe sellers, Jeanne and Dennis Masel, bought the five-story home for nearly $6 million in 2017 and undertook a four-year renovation with Leroy Street Studio beginning in 2018.\nThe Masels cut the price at the start of this year to $17 million before re-listing it with Compass\u2019 Tim Malone at $16.5 million in April and dropping the price again to $14.5 million at the end of May.\n\nThe sale takes the crown from 53 Prospect Park West, a townhouse around the corner from the Masels\u2019 former home that initially sought $30 million when it hit the market in 2021. Poly Prep Country Day School\nbought the home for $13.5\nfrom the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture in 2024 in an off-market deal.\nSingle- and multi-family homes have been some of Brooklyn\u2019s most popular offerings for the past several years. In the second quarter, the borough saw its average price per square foot for 1-3 family homes increase almost 11 percent to $829 from last year, according to a market report from Miller Samuel.\nIn Park Slope in particular, while the number of sales in the first half of 2025 decreased 20 percent, the average price per square foot increased 2 percent year-over-year and homes on average sold for over their asking price, according to a townhouse report from Leslie Garfield.\nThe Massels\u2019 townhouse, which sits less than a block from Prospect Park, has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The garden level features a sunken den with a gas fireplace, an open kitchen with an 18-foot marble island and direct garden access. A second gas fireplace is in the parlor-level living room, and an open library with glass walls looks out to the backyard.\nThe third-floor primary suite has a walk-in dressing room, private terrace and en-suite bathroom.

Built on half an acre in 2009, the 8,300-square-foot home includes six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool, according to records.

Last year, designer Tommy Hilfiger sold the lakefront home at 313 Dunbar Road for\n$28 million\n.\nThe Tasekaars\u2019 off-market deal marks the latest pricey\nPalm Beach\nsale, as the island revs up for the busy season.

        "content": "Hot on the heels of California\u2019s CEQA overhaul, state lawmakers are clearing the way for even more housing construction.\nSenate Bill 79, the landmark housing proposal that overrides local zoning laws to increase high-density housing near transit hubs, passed in the state legislature hours before the 2025 legislative session concluded, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe bill, introduced by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener, allows for the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the new zoning rules.\nThe zoning height limits are tier-based according to the type of transit offered at each hub. Tier 1 zoning includes heavy rail lines such as the L.A. Metro\u2019s B and D subway lines and permits buildings from six to nine stories, depending on proximity to the stations. Tier 2 zoning includes bus routes with dedicated lanes and light rail lines such as Los Angeles\u2019 A, C, E and K lines with the possibility of building between five and eight stories.\n\u201cOver the last five years, housing affordability and homelessness have consistently been among the top priorities in California. The smartest place to build new housing is within existing communities, near the state\u2019s major transit investments that connect people to jobs, schools and essential services,\u201d state Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva said in support of the bill.\n\nThe state is rushing to meet a housing crisis that has gripped the Golden State for years.\nIn July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, which increase environmental review exemptions for infill housing, removing hurdles for developers. AB 130 exempts housing-rich infill developments smaller than 20 acres or builder\u2019s remedy projects under 5 acres from CEQA analysis, while Senate Bill 131 protects any rezoning required by a municipality\u2019s Housing Element from CEQA analysis.\nSB 79 faced pushback from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to oppose the bill last month. Bill co-author Traci Park called it a \u201cone-size-fits-all mandate from Sacramento.\u201d The resolution called for L.A. to be exempt from the state-mandated upzoning as it already has a state-approved housing plan. Mayor Karen Bass joined the chorus of local officials opposing SB 79.\nThe bill heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month. California overall must plan to build more than 2.5 million new homes by the turn of the next decade,\naccording\nto its Statewide Housing Plan.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The package includes a $62.4 million senior construction loan from Derby Lane Partners, an $11 million loan from Hoyne Savings Bank and more than $17 million in state and federal historic preservation tax credits, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe redevelopment is slated to be delivered next spring, according to the project\u2019s website. It joins several\nother\noffice-to-residential conversions in the Loop, including city-backed efforts along LaSalle Street, as landlords face high office vacancies.\nBuilt in 1928 as the Millinery Mart Building, the brick and limestone tower later housed Esquire magazine for the publication\u2019s first couple of decades and is home to Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse, which will stay on the ground floor.\nThe building\nchanged\nhands several times in recent years: Rochester-based Intersection Realty bought it from an Acres venture in 2022, then gave it back through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure last year. Acres then\nteamed\nwith Mavrek to pursue the conversion, winning Chicago City Council approval last December.\n\nWith\npermits now in hand\n, the development team can begin to start interior work. The finished product will feature 105 studios, 105 one-bedrooms and 42 two-bedrooms with in-unit workspaces, plus amenities like a co-working lounge, gym and rooftop terrace. According to Mavrek\u2019s website, the third floor will house most of the amenities. Fifty-one units \u2014 about 20 percent \u2014 will be affordable, priced at an average of 60 percent of the area median income. There will be no on-site parking. The project was designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners.\nThe timing comes as downtown\u2019s construction pipeline is all but frozen, with little relief expected until 2027. That scarcity has bolstered landlords\u2019 leverage, pushing median Class A net rents up 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is the city\u2019s largest shopping mall, and is now only 7 percent occupied after\nretailers\nsuch as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Zara, Steve Madden and Kate Space\nmade exits\n. Bloomingdale\u2019s was its last anchor tenant, occupying 340,000 square feet of space, and it closed shop earlier this year even though the company\u2019s lease wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2046, per Morningstar data.\n\nUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties stopped making payments on a $558 million note a couple years ago; total exposure is $626 million now. The latest servicer commentary notes that the lender is in negotiations with the ground lessor over a ground lease default \u2014 and that the lender intends to foreclose as soon as possible.\n\u201cUpon foreclosure, Lender will immediately market for disposition,\u201d the special servicer commentary, via Morningstar, reads.\nA notice of trustee\u2019s sale was recorded in October last year.\nThe mall\u2019s\nforeclosure auction\nhas been delayed several times but now appears to be an \u201cimminent outcome,\u201d according to Morningstar. The property\u2019s operating losses are continuing at about $4.6 million for the first six months of the year. The mall made about $57 million when its current loan was underwritten in 2016.\n",

        "content": "Adam Hochfelder is facing a new issue in New York, this time courtesy of the state tax department.\nThe former Nassau County developer was named New York\u2019s top delinquent taxpayer with more than $48 million in unpaid personal income taxes, according to\nNewsday\n.\nThe onetime \u201cWharton Whiz Kid,\u201d who once controlled a slice of Manhattan\u2019s skyline, holds the dubious distinction of leading the state\u2019s \u201cTop 100\u201d list of individual tax scofflaws.\nThe ranking, published periodically by the state Department of Taxation and Finance, highlights taxpayers with active warrants, the legal lever that allows authorities to seize property, withhold income and block big-ticket purchases, including real estate.\nIn a statement from Hochfelder\u2019s counsel to\nThe Real Deal\n, his lawyers disputed the underlying taxes allegedly owed to the state, claiming former partner Anthony Westreich issued him an improper K-1 tied to the sale of 1440 Broadway more than a decade ago.\n\u201cIn 2013 when 1440 Broadway was sold, Mr. Westreich issued an erroneous K-1 to Mr. Hochfelder improperly allocating $50 million in profits to Hochfelder, nine years after Hochfelder had sold his interest in 1440 Broadway to Westreich in 2004,\u201d the statement read. Hochfelder, per his lawyer, was only a 1 percent partner in the property after he sold his interest.\n\u201cHochfelder\u2019s counsel has been working with NY State to get Hochfelder\u2019s 2013 tax allocation corrected.\u201d\n\nHochfelder\u2019s tax woes are the latest entry in a career defined by difficulties.\nHe was convicted in 2008 of duping family and friends into lending him $17 million, supposedly for resort investments and later served two years in prison after stealing another $2.5 million. In 2019, he\npleaded guilty again\nto a misdemeanor charge stemming from the older fraud case.\nHe\u2019s far from alone on the delinquent roll call. More than 20 Long Island taxpayers cracked the top 100 this summer; Nassau residents owed a combined $68 million.\nAmong them: restaurateur Zvi Yosef, who owes nearly $3 million tied to his shuttered kosher barbecue spot Chimichurri, and George and Tassos Strifas, operators of East Meadow\u2019s Colony Diner, who also owe close to $3 million in sales tax and previously settled wage theft and harassment claims.\nState officials frame the list as both a warning and an equalizer.\n\u201cThis list is about transparency and fairness,\u201d a Tax Department spokesman told Newsday, arguing that enforcement protects compliant taxpayers from being undercut by those who flout obligations. Still, the agency acknowledges the overall sums are small compared with Albany\u2019s multibillion-dollar budget.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

When rescue crews responded to the site, they removed the patient from a \u201cconfined space\u201d on the second floor of the construction site and airlifted him to Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. The man died later that day.\nWhitman Family Development, owner of Bal Harbour Shops in Bal Harbour, is working on a 250,000-square-foot expansion of the 500,000-square-foot luxury shopping center.\nLast year, a construction worker\ndied\nand three others were injured after a portion of a tower crane collapsed at a downtown Fort Lauderdale site where Gables Residential was developing the 43-story Gables Riverwalk apartment tower.

        "content": "A Lake Geneva mansion is about to hit the market asking $8.5 million in the luxury resort town where demand is hot and listings rarely go public.\nThe 7,500 square-foot house at 837 Bayview Drive in Lake Geneva is the third notable home in the last month on the lake to be marketed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d before hitting the public market. Houses of that value rarely hit the public market at all in Lake Geneva, where sellers often opt for exclusivity and sell their multimillion-dollar mansions among private brokers.\nTwo lakefront mansions\nlisted by Compass\u2019s Bob Webster\n\u2014 at $8.7 million and $9.8 million \u2014 got contingent offers just three days after hitting the market in early September following a short period listed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nGina Nocek, an @properties broker who is representing the sellers at 837 Bayview Drive, said Webster\u2019s success motivated her clients to use the same marketing strategy and use a delayed listing in the Milwaukee-area\u2019s METRO MLS. The listing alerts other brokers that the house is about to hit the market, and it shows up on some listing services before officially going public.\nNocek said she and her clients think they can fetch a higher price by getting more eyes on the property rather than pursuing a pocket listing. The asking price is $1,135 per square foot.\n\u201cWe felt that we have a better chance of actually driving up the price rather than selling internally,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of Realtors do that, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a benefit to the sellers. Why not put it on the market and get more exposure?\u201d\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom house was built in 2018, Nocek said. It sits on a half-acre lot on the Northeast end of Geneva Lake and has two canopied piers.\nThe listing will go public on Sept. 19, Nocek said, and showings will begin Sept. 20.\n\nNocek declined to identify the property\u2019s sellers, but she said they are relocating to Florida. Property tax bills are addressed to a trust under the name Peggy Roth.\nThe string of properties using \u201ccoming soon\u201d listings is unique for Geneva Lake,\nwhere private listings\nand\noff-market sales\nare common. Of the handful of lakefront homes that sold this year for more than $5 million, just one was listed on the public market, according to listing services.\nReal Estate prices on Geneva Lake have been growing in the last few years as inventory has shrunk and demand for second homes has risen. Homeowners are reluctant to sell their valuable lakefront property, so competition can be fierce when listings go public.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, I used to see 25 lakefront listings. Now we\u2019re lucky if we see five a year,\u201d Nocek said. \u201cI think since COVID, people are not selling them as much as they used to. And that\u2019s what\u2019s creating the increase in price.\u201d\nWebster, who listed two lakefront properties in August using delayed listings, said the process went well for his sellers. Both properties had several showings booked in the first two days of going public, and they got contingent offers within three days. Webster said the properties are under contract and expected to close in mid-October.\nWebster described the delayed public listing as an alternative to office exclusive listings, which Compass has been pursuing with its three-phased marketing approach that begins with an internal private exclusive listing. The delayed public listings can give sellers a broader reach than private listings, while giving the property time to generate interest before hitting the market, Webster said.\n\u201cWe were very successful in getting what I think was the best price and terms for the seller we could, and also at the same time giving all the real estate agents in the realtor community a fair shot at showing it and selling it if they had a prospective buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think it was a win-win all the way around.\u201d\n",

        "content": "St. Charles is preparing to bring order \u2014 and revenue \u2014 to its Wild West short-term rental market.\nCity officials this week outlined a plan to regulate and tax Airbnbs, Vrbos and other short-term rentals, which currently operate without oversight or city revenue collection, in the suburb roughly 45 miles west of downtown Chicago, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The move follows growing concern about the impact of rentals on neighbors and the lack of enforcement tools.\nMayor Clint Hull said any standards must be enforceable, with clear authority to revoke or deny registrations if operators fail to comply.\nCommunity Development Director Russel Colby pitched a registration program run through the city\u2019s website, requiring hosts to disclose property details, ownership information and manager contacts. Operators would also agree to abide by occupancy limits, parking rules ans noise and trash regulations. Violators could face suspension, revocation or denial of renewal.\nWhile staff have not\u00a0 proposed a registration fee, fines would be levied against unregistered hosts, escalating with repeat offenses. The city also plans to tap AirDNA, a third-party analytics firm, to track operators and calculate expected tax revenue.\n\nCity staff estimate more than $70,000 in tax revenue went uncollected last year. Under the proposal, short-term rentals would be subject to the same hotel tax as local lodging operators: 6 percent of 94 percent of gross rental revenue. Currently, the tax is self-reported and largely unenforced, leaving the city blind to the scope of the market.\nOfficials said they identified 47 active short-term rentals in St. Charles, with 44 listed on Airbnb and the rest on Vrbo. With demand for alternative accommodations still strong post-pandemic, more properties could surface once the city builds a formal tracking system. Enforcement measures and bans have been\nconsidered\nin\nlocales\nacross the country since short-term rentals\u2019 pandemic\nboom\n.\nElsewhere in the Chicago area lawmakers have addressed issues with short-term rentals. Highland Park\nblocked\na timeshare plan for \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of Michael Jordan\u2019s former estate, and Chicago aldermen squabbled over whether to\nlower\nthe threshold of ward-wide bans on short-term rentals if enough residents sign a petition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

And\nThe Real Deal\nrecently discovered that Behler personally pushed for a no-bid contract to a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager.\nNow,\nTRD\nfound that Behler \u2014 who currently serves as chairman of the board \u2014 had extensive past business dealings with Mark Patterson, an independent board member who once chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee.\nTRD\nalso found that Patterson faced similar allegations about his objectivity and independence while serving on another board.\nAbout a decade ago, Behler agreed to provide at least two loans to Boomerang Systems, a robotic garage company led by Patterson, as it neared bankruptcy. It is unclear whether the debt was ultimately paid back based on a review of bankruptcy and SEC filings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good look, whether in fact he\u2019s compromised or not; the optics are bad,\u201d said Charles Elson, the founding director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\nParamount declined to comment. Patterson did not return a request to comment.\nIndependent board of directors are supposed to provide an added level of objective oversight for publicly traded companies. But the company\u2019s disclosures around millions of dollars heading to Behler\u2019s personal business, along with his high compensation relative to the stock\u2019s performance, raise questions about whether the board is acting in shareholder\u2019s interest or Behler\u2019s.\nThis comes at a critical time. Paramount is in the midst of\nselling the company\nas its stock hovers around $7 per share.\nBoomerang\u2019s bankruptcy and Patterson\u2019s undisclosed ties\nParamount and Behler\u2019s ties to Patterson go back years.\nPatterson, who was formerly a managing director of Merrill Lynch, became the\nCEO\nof Boomerang Systems in 2010. The company built a new technology that essentially created an automatic valet system where parked cars would slide to drivers on concrete slabs, no human operators needed.\nIn 2012, Boomerang\nannounced\nthat Paramount would use Boomerang\u2019s technology for a 256-space garage in an unnamed multifamily project on the West Coast. At that time, Boomerang\u2019s system was only installed in three properties, and Paramount\u2019s project would have been by far its largest.\n\u201cHaving an accomplished and experienced real estate firm like Paramount Group select Boomerang provides great affirmation of our value proposition of enhancing developer\u2019s margins,\u201d said Patterson in a release at the time.\nBoomerang said its robotic car garage would expedite the construction timeline and improve the \u201ceconomics of the project.\u201d But Boomerang ran into one disaster after the next across its projects. In Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, a condo project using Boomerang left residents waiting hours to get their cars.\nBehler was a major investor in Boomerang, according to SEC filings, and participated in offerings for convertible notes, a type of debt that can be converted into equity such as stock.\nBehler also contributed to efforts to keep the company afloat. By late 2014, Behler joined other investors and committed up to $400,000 as an \u201caffiliate\u201d lender. Behler ultimately loaned the $400,000 and controlled over 5 percent of the common stock of Boomerang, owning over 1 million shares, according to an SEC filing as of June 2015.\nBut Boomerang filed for bankruptcy in August 2015 and Patterson, also a major stockholder in the company, stepped down as CEO.\nIn 2016, a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the company\u2019s assets to an existing lender for $2.5 million. Equity holders in the company were wiped out through bankruptcy. (The case officially closed in 2020.)\nBehler was not listed as a creditor in Boomerang\u2019s bankruptcy petition and it is unclear whether his loans were ever repaid.\n\nIn May 2018, Patterson joined Paramount\u2019s board.\nPatterson chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee. He also served as the lead independent director, a role where Patterson acted as a liaison between Behler, the chairman of Paramount\u2019s board, and the other independent board members.\nParamount never disclosed Behler\u2019s past ties to Boomerang in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or its proxy statement.\nStock exchanges set the rules for independent directors, but corporate governance experts say it\u2019s not unusual for board members and CEOs to have friendly relationships.\nAnn Lipton, a business law professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s law school, described the standards for independence as \u201cvery loose.\u201d\nBut Behler\u2019s investment and possible debt to Patterson\u2018s former company raise questions about Paramount\u2019s motivation for keeping Patterson on the board.\nIn 2021, Patterson was voted off the board by shareholders in an uncontested election, with 56 percent of shareholder votes going against Patterson. (Paramount said the vote was a result of Patterson\u2019s role as lead independent board member and not because of his qualifications.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon for shareholders to reject a director that way,\u201d said Michael Levin, founder of consulting firm the Activist Investor.\nParamount ultimately overruled the shareholders and kept Patterson on the board, Crain\u2019s reported. Paramount told shareholders it believed Patterson is a \u201cvaluable contributor\u201d with a \u201ctremendous skillset\u201d, according to an SEC filing.\nPatterson remains on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, serving on the corporate governance committee.\nThe ends justify the means\nPatterson\u2019s board participation \u2014 and prior relationships \u2014\u00a0have raised concerns elsewhere.\nPatterson serves on the board of Digital Realty, a data center REIT, where fellow Paramount board member, Greg Wright, is the chief investment officer.\nThe former chairman of Digital Realty, Laurence Chapman, took issue with Patterson and Wright\u2019s relationship. In 2023, Chapman resigned from Digital Realty\u2019s board and cited a number of alleged corporate governance issues by the board and Patterson in his resignation letter.\nIn addition to serving on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, Wright used to work for Patterson and the two are personal friends, Chapman claimed.\nChapman said these relationships had the \u201cpotential to impact real or perceived objectivity and independence\u201d of the board.\n(Digital Realty said in an SEC filing that the company \u201cwishes to emphasize that the written notification of resignation reflects the thoughts and beliefs of Mr. Chapman only.\u201d)\nChapman also alleged that Patterson personally contacted other company directors at Digital Realty to lobby for executive changes, claiming such maneuvers were improper for someone in his board member position.\n\u201cWhen I tried to discuss my concerns about his approach, Mark told me that in his view, \u2018The end justifies the means.\u2019 That principle originated in Machiavelli\u2019s \u2018The Prince,\u2019\u201d wrote Chapman in the letter.\nWhen it comes to the traits of good governance, Chapman went on, \u201cMachiavelli\u2019s principles seem to be the polar opposite.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A deal for a waterfront mansion in Malba, Queens, just set a new neighborhood record.\nA home at 117 Malba Drive closed for $6.3 million in August, making the priciest sale to hit the books in the wealthy enclave, known for its sprawling suburban-like abodes, according to public records. It last traded for $5.5 million in 2017, which held the previous record.\nThe Mediterranean-style estate hit the market last April with an asking price of nearly $8 million, according to Zillow. It snagged a signed contract in July after multiple price cuts brought its ask down to just under $7 million. The identities of both the buyer and seller were shielded by an LLC.\nThe property spans 8,300 square feet and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a finished basement. It also features a backyard and multiple terraces. The deal includes a deeded boat dock in the neighborhood\u2019s private marina.\nPo Wei Tair of Remax 1st Choice in Great Neck, and Hui Fang Chen of Flushing-based AAA Young Shuen Realty had the listing.\n\nNews of the deal comes as prices have been rising in the luxury section of Whitestone, Queens. In the first quarter of 2025, Malba ranked as the 11th most expensive neighborhood in New York City with a median sale price of $1.6 million, falling just behind the Theatre District in Manhattan, according to a report from\nProperty Shark\n.\nSellers in the neighborhood have been trying to push prices to new heights for several years, though deals continue to fall short of their aspirations.\nAnother waterfront mansion at 3 Point Crescent hit the market in 2017 with an asking price of $9.2 million, at the time the most expensive asking price in Queens. However, the seven-bedroom home didn\u2019t land a buyer until five years later, when it finally sold for just $4 million. It\u2019s now under contract with a last asking price of $5.9 million.\nDespite its climbing prices, the top trades in the borough have largely occurred in the Rockaways. A beachfront home next to Jacob Riis Park scored Queens\u2019 priciest deal in 2023 when it closed for $8.3 million, followed by another home south of Rockaway Beach Boulevard, which sold for $7.6 million in March.\n",

        "content": "This week will determine the fate of two casino proposals in Manhattan.\nAfter more than two years of trying to sell their visions to the public, Wednesday is either the end of the road or a green light to embark on the final stage of the casino competition for Silverstein Properties and SL Green Realty.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees \u2014 each made up of six members \u2014\u00a0will vote on the proposals put forward by the two teams.\nAt least four members of each CAC must vote yes on the respective proposals for the projects to proceed to the final stage of the casino licensing competition. If approved, the proposals will be considered by the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board, which will ultimately decide which three projects are awarded a license.\nA \u2018no\u2019 vote means the project is out of the running. It also means we get to see what becomes of the project sites sans casino. Silverstein has said its property will remain a \u201cgiant hole in the ground.\u201d SL Green\u2019s site is already an office tower, the long-term financial health of which has been\ncalled into question\nif the real estate investment trust does not secure a license.\nSL Green, which has teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, wants to convert the 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway in Times Square into a $5.4 billion casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nSilverstein, along with Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a vacant site at 41st Street and 11th Avenue. The project would feature a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue. The developer has also committed funding to convert offices in and around Community Board 4 into 2,000 housing units. The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.\nThe CACs\u2019 votes are intended to determine whether a project enjoys public support or not. Of course, it is more complicated than that: CAC members were appointed by elected officials, some of whom have made their opposition to casinos clear. Both of the CACs, as with each of the other teams, held two public hearings on the proposals. You could tally up the speakers at those hearings (and in fact, Silverstein\u2019s team counted 122 speakers who supported its proposal at the last hearing, compared to 39 opposed), but that is a snapshot based on hearing attendance and is no guarantee of how CAC members will vote.\nBoth proposals have their detractors, the Broadway League and residents of Manhattan Plaza among the most vocal against the Times Square and Manhattan West proposals, respectively.\nTo what extent these voices, the CAC members\u2019 pre-existing positions on casinos and the various perks promised by the competitors factor into Wednesday\u2019s vote remains to be seen.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I have a guess for how Wednesday\u2019s casino vote will go, but I want to hear from you. What proposals will make it through the CAC process to the competition\u2019s final round? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fortis Property Group\u2019s Olympia Dumbo appears prominently in Spike Lee\u2019s new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d In addition to several shots of the building\u2019s exterior, a model of the building also has a cameo, and at one point, A$AP Rocky\u2019s character name-drops the building.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new report from State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli finds that New York will see relatively little benefit from the Republicans\u2019 sweeping new spending bill, with the biggest winners limited to seniors and tipped workers,\nThe City\nreports. While provisions like deductions for overtime pay, car loan interest and a higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions exist, most New Yorkers won\u2019t qualify or see significant savings. The findings set the stage for a fierce political battle ahead of the 2026 elections, as Republicans tout the cuts and Democrats highlight reductions to key safety net programs.\n\u2014\u00a0Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s retirement has sparked a crowded Democratic scramble for his Manhattan congressional seat, but Assembly member Micah Lasher has quickly emerged as an early front-runner and is reported to be Nadler\u2019s succession choice, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n. Lasher\u2019s political experience, West Side base and alignment with Nadler\u2019s progressive brand position him strongly. Still, a handful of younger or high-profile candidates may jump in. With no ranked-choice voting in the primary, even a narrow plurality could secure the nomination.\n\u2014\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Zohran Mamdani for mayor in a\nNew York Times\nop-ed, calling him a partner in her priority to make New York more affordable while ensuring public safety and economic growth. Hochul highlighted areas of agreement \u2014 affordability, public safety, combating antisemitism \u2014 but repeatedly distanced herself from Mamdani\u2019s democratic socialist agenda, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$10.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 944 Park Avenue. The Upper East Side condo unit is a 3,300-square-foot consolidation of three units.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18 million\nfor 643-47 Ninth Avenue. The Hell\u2019s Kitchen apartment building is a five-story, multifamily building with an office/commercial component. LNR Partners is the seller and Aetna Realty Financial is the buyer.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29 million for a condo unit at 50 Central Park South. The Central Park condo unit is 6,800 square feet and\nlisted\nby Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 76,363-square-foot, 11-story, mixed-use residential and community facility at 16 Convent Avenue in Manhattan. Architect Nickolas Kazalas is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Back then, they were only offering the 500,000-square-foot office condominium, which they own 50-50. This time around, MetLife is including the 40,000-square-foot retail condo at the base of the tower, according to an offering memo from Eastdil, which is handling the sale.\nRepresentatives for Beacon and MetLife did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The year 2023 ended with about 29 million square feet of transactions in Manhattan, a decrease from the previous year.\nNow, 2025 is on track to record more than 40 million square feet worth of Manhattan office leases, which would be the first time the borough has cracked that figure since before the pandemic.\nThe Midtown building at the corner of East 47th Street sits across the street from Extell Development\u2019s 570 Fifth Avenue, where Gary Barnett has reportedly signed the law firm Simpson Thacher to a\n700,000-square-foot office lease\nto kick off the development of his planned 29-story office and retail project.\nMetLife bought 575 Fifth Avenue for $385 million in 2005 and sold a 50 percent stake in the office portion to Beacon for an undisclosed price in 2015.\n",

The buyer appears to have combined three units into one, totaling about 3,300 square feet.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded was in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, with the sale of two mixed-use properties, which sit next to each other, at\n643 and 647 Ninth Avenue\nfor $18 million. The seller was an affiliate of Miami Beach-based\nLNR Partners\n, and the buyers were LLCs tied to\nAetna Realty Financial Corp\n. The property at 643 Ninth Avenue stands five stories tall and has 19 apartments across 15,200 square feet. The other building, at 647 Ninth Avenue, is six stories tall and has four apartments across about 6,700 square feet.

The five-bedroom, 8,300-square-foot, waterfront mansion sits on a 23,400-square-foot lot and has a gym, multiple terraces, outdoor kitchen, saltwater pool and dock. The seller was an LLC linked to\nFrank Pecora\n, who purchased the property in 2017 for $5.5 million. It hit the market in April 2024 with an asking price of about $7.9 million. RE/MAX 1st Choice\u2019s\nPo Wei David Tair\nhad the listing.

        "content": "Thaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube, a real estate titan of the San Francisco Bay Area and prolific philanthropist, has died at the age of 94.\nTaube died at his home in San Mateo County, according to a statement from Taube Philanthropies.\nBorn in Poland in 1931, Taube immigrated to the United States in 1939 with his parents Zygmunt Taube and Lola Popper Taube just before the Nazi invasion of the country. The family settled in California, with Taube even breaking into Hollywood as a boy with his role as a Polish child in the 1942 wartime film \u201cThe Greenie.\u201d\nTaube went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering and a master\u2019s in industrial management from Stanford University. He spent time in the U.S. Air Force before going on to work for two companies in the\nsemiconductor\nindustry. After his stint in tech, Taube turned his sights elsewhere.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d the Polish philanthropist said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nAt first, he joined forces with Stanford roommate Benjamin Johnson to create The Woodmont Companies. The firm went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nFrom there, he became chairman and CEO of Koracorp Industries, the successor to San Francisco-based apparel company Koret of California. He was in charge of the company from 1973 until 1979 when he negotiated the sale of the company to denim giant Levi Strauss.\nOnce he sold Koret of California, he established the Koret Foundation for charitable causes, leading the organization for the next quarter century.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me then, and has continued to stand out through two decades of watching Tad in action, is the depth of his philanthropic pursuits,\u201d former Secretary of State George P. Shultz once said of Taube. \u201cBeyond his generosity of spirit, Tad actively works to make a difference. He wants to see results.\u201d\nIn his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nIn the Bay Area and across California, Taube funded projects including the revamp of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Besides that, he launched programs for at-risk youth in tandem with Bay Area sports teams such as \u201cHoops for Kids\u201d with the Golden State Warriors, \u201cTouchdowns for Kids\u201d with the San Francisco 49ers and \u201cGoals for Kids\u201d with the San Jose Sharks.\nIn addition to sports, education and museums, Taube invested in health care initiatives like the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health. He helped launch the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative between several universities including Stanford.\nTaube is survived by his wife Dianne, who serves as president of Taube Philanthropies, and their children Mark, Paula, Sean, Juddson, Travis and Zakary.\n\u201cHis impact will shape the world for years to come,\u201d Dianne said.\n",

The seven condos are attached to Bowie House, the Auberge Resorts Collection hotel in\nFort Worth\u2019s Cultural District\n.\nThe 2,700-square-foot home, still under construction, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The other condos range from two to four bedrooms with asking prices between $5.5 million and $6.4 million, according to Douglas Elliman agent Hannah Sullivan, who has the listing.\n\nEntrepreneur and cutting horse champ Jo Ellard is the developer behind Bowie House. After years of traveling to Fort Worth for equestrian events, Ellard recognized the demand for luxury accommodations in Cowtown. The hotel and condos are close to Dickies Arena and the Will Rogers Memorial Center, which host rodeos and horse competitions. The property is also adjacent to the River Crest Country Club.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the only thing like that there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have any competitors.\u201d\nThe condos at Bowie House aren\u2019t just the first of their kind in Fort Worth;\nthey\u2019re among the first in Texas\n. Other branded luxury condo projects in the Texas pipeline include\ntwo Ritz-Carlton residences\n, an Auberge-branded condo development and a St. Regis tower, all in the Houston area, and\nthe Knox in Dallas\n, another Auberge concept.\nAlthough three of the units have already sold, this fourth residence was the first to be listed publicly, according to Sullivan. The rest are also under construction, and the next two are expected to list in October and November.Residential inventory has been steadily piling up in Fort Worth. It\u2019s no longer a seller\u2019s market,\nbut\ninventory is still lower\nthan the average in Dallas and in Texas overall.\n",

Those builders account for a significant\nshare\nof the 65,000 structures built in floodplains since the storm.\nTexas has no statewide code for\nfloodplain\nconstruction, leaving standards to local governments, which often allow development if homes are elevated and detention ponds are built. That flexibility has fueled suburban expansion but, critics say, ignores mounting climate risks.\nJim Blackburn, an environmental attorney and Rice University professor, told the outlet that developers are likely targeting cheaper, more available land in floodplains as large tracts elsewhere dwindle.\n\u201cWe have generally accepted floodplain development in the past,\u201d Blackburn told the outlet. \u201cI just think it may not be the right way to go forward in the future.\u201d\nMiami\n-based Lennar, through its Friendswood Development arm, has been especially active, with 5,700 homes built since Harvey, 25 percent of them in flood zones. Its projects include Tavola in New Caney, where residents reported major flooding during Tropical Storm Imelda just months after moving in.\n\nMeritage built nearly 3,000 homes \u2014 28 percent of them in floodplains \u2014 including the controversial Spring Brook Village in Spring Branch that drew sharp pushback from flood control advocates and residents that contended the elevated homes would make flooding in adjacent neighborhoods worse. That project ultimately won Houston City Council approval.\nD.R. Horton\nput up 8,100 homes, about 760 of them in high-risk zones, while\nPerry Homes\ndelivered 3,900, nearly 20 percent in mapped floodplains.\nPerry\u2019s Woodridge Village project near the Harris-Montgomery county line triggered lawsuits after nearby homes flooded; the dispute ended with a $14 million land sale to Houston and Harris County for detention basins.\nMcGuyer Homebuilders, now part of Dream Finders Homes, placed nearly a third of its 2,200 post-Harvey builds in flood zones, including portions of Towne Lake in Cypress.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Part of that strategy involves tacking a crack at retail real estate abandoned by other national chain stores.\nBarnes &amp; Noble is gearing up for three store openings across the metro area as part of a nationwide\ngrowth\nstrategy, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The bookseller confirmed upcoming locations in Spring, the Aliana community between Richmond and Sugar Land in Fort Bend County, and on Fry Road in Katy. The additions will bring its Houston-area store count to 15.\nIn Aliana, the company pre-leased an 18,000-square-foot building in the Market Center at 10191 Grand Parkway, according to developer Property Commerce. Construction is set to begin in weeks, with delivery expected in the spring or early summer. The retail center is nearly fully leased, anchored by H-E-B and Target, with the Barnes &amp; Noble site designed by LA Architects and built by U.S. Builders.\nAnother store will open in mid-November at the Target-anchored Grand Parkway Marketplace in Spring, taking over a 12,500-square-foot space formerly occupied by Party City, at 6600 Spring Stuebner Road. Another deal was inked for a nearly 22,000-square-foot former Party City in Katy\u2019s Greentree Shopping Center at 435 South Fry Road, which is slated to debut early next year, Ironbridge Realty confirmed.\n\nThese moves follow a January reopening of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s renovated Town &amp; Country Village store and a July 2024\nopening\nin the Conroe Marketplace in a space vacated by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nThe Houston surge is part of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s broader rebound after years of shrinking. The chain said it\nopened\nmore stores last year alone than in the entire decade between 2009 and 2019, when it\nsold\nto hedge fund Elliott Management for $475 million cash.\nBy the end of this year, it expects to open more than 60 locations nationwide, with a similar pace planned for next year. It also recently struck a $3.25 million deal to acquire Books Inc., a longtime San Francisco Bay Area independent chain.\nThe company\u2019s strategy for success is not just in its retail expansion, but also to keep local bookshops in business. James Daunt, Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s CEO, said last year that over the past couple of decades the company has bought and maintained bankrupt independent regional bookstores.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Veranda Apartments, which was delivered last year, is about 7 miles southeast of downtown, near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and the Tesla factory.\nBow River Capital coined and trademarked the term \u201cRodeo Region,\u201d which refers to the Southwest and Mountain West states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.\n\nThe firm also recently bought two properties in Kansas City, Missouri and the 337-unit Camden Midtown, at 2303 Louisiana Street in Midtown Houston, from Camden Property Trust and rebranded it as\nHadley Midtown Apartments\n.\nInvestors like Bow River Capital are calling bottom for Austin\u2019s multifamily market, which has been wrecked by a historic glut of supply that resulted in big losses for rent rates and occupancy.\nRents slid 7.5 percent\nlast month, compared to a year prior, and occupancy fell to 85 percent, according to ApartmentData.com.\nIn fact, rents have fallen so much that the city\nleads the country in rental affordability\n, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said last month. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nAustin\u2019s tailwinds are promising, though, Pan said. In the last decade, the city has seen 30 percent population growth and 48 percent job growth. Its Sun Belt peers average growth rates of about 25 or 30 percent.\n",

Records show the sellers are Lawrence and Nancy Reid, who bought the house for $4.9 million in 2021. Built in 2019 on 0.3 acres, the home has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool.\nThe couple listed it for $8.5 million in February, and the price was since dropped three times, Zillow shows. David Roberts with Royal Palm Properties has the listing.\nThe second-priciest home to find a buyer last week is the 3,300-square-foot townhouse at 217 Everglade Avenue in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $7.3 million. Records show the seller is the estate of the late Gilbert C. Maurer, the former chief operating officer of media conglomerate Hearst, who died in April. He bought the townhome for $1.1 million in 1995, property records show. It was built that year, and has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, according to property records.\nIt hit the market on Sept. 5 asking $7.3 million and went pending three days later, Zillow shows. Paulette and Dana Koch with the Corcoran Group have the listing.",

        "content": "Marc Benioff recently said his tech company was able to cut thousands of jobs due to artificial intelligence, but rising demand in the sector is also leading the Salesforce CEO to add space at its Manhattan home.\nThe San Francisco-based company agreed to expand its footprint by 71,000 square feet at 3 Bryant Park, otherwise known as Salesforce Tower, CoStar\nreported\n. The dual expansion and renewal means Salesforce leases a 311,000-square-foot chunk of the 1.2-million-square-foot Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge property at 1095 Sixth Avenue.\nIn a statement, an executive for the tech company said its \u201cvision for real estate is to create the right spaces and experiences that accelerate growth and empower humans, agents and robots to work alongside one another.\u201d\nFinancial details of the lease were not disclosed, but Salesforce\u2019s lease is locked in through May 2029. The additional space will include an employee training center, collaboration and hybrid-work areas, and space for a customer-focused initiative.\nSalesforce\u2019s footprint has been boomeranging back and forth in recent years as the office landscape has changed. Last year, the company said it leased 900,000 square feet in its home city of San Francisco, a 45 percent reduction from the 1.6 million square feet it said it had in the city as of early 2023.\n\nArtificial intelligence is counterintuitively bringing tech companies back to their physical spaces, though. Tech companies\u2019 leasing rose 21 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to CBRE, accounting for about a sixth of total office leasing volume in the country.\nThis year, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\nlanded a $1.13 billion refi\nfor its trophy office tower, receiving a CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal. It paid $2.2 billion in 2015 to buy the Bryant Park tower, the second most-expensive office purchase in U.S. history at the time.\nThe property was 97 percent leased at the time of the refinancing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is slated to be built on land that Marina Annex Housing acquired for $2 million in February, property records show. The seller was the Riviera Beach Housing Authority, which was deeded the land by the city in 2024 for $10 and remains a partner in the venture.\n\u201cThe way we can effectively work as the housing authority is to\u2026 partner with others to bring affordable housing to this community,\u201d said Riviera Beach Housing Authority Executive Director John Hurt.\nThe housing authority will also partner with the Alpha Phi Alpha Foundation to run the community center, which can be used for educational purposes, meeting room space and offices for nonprofits, he added.\n\nA later presentation by Harris of Urban Farmers revealed that the community center would be named after the late Edward Rodgers, the first Black circuit court judge of Palm Beach County.\nSince its founding in 1983, O\u2019Connor Capital Partners has developed $30 billion worth of projects in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Asia, according to the company\u2019s website. Led by CEO Bill O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Connor Capital\npaid $28.8 million for an 86,000-square-foot shopping center in Delray Beach\nin July.\nWorkforce housing developer Urban Farmers was started in 2010 by former Marriott International development manager Terry Booty. In 2019, the Hallandale Beach City Commission approved Urban Farmers\u2019 plan to build the 200-unit\nEighth Avenue Commons\nproject on a parking lot previously owned by the Hallandale Church of God.\nDevelopers are targeting Riviera Beach, as they seek new frontiers to build in Palm Beach County.\nTwo blocks east of Marina Annex\u2019s development site, Boca Raton-based SobelCo proposed a\n1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use project\nwith 508 condos at West 11th Street and Broadway. Between those two development sites the Riviera Beach Community Development Corporation is building Villa L\u2019Onz, a 12-unit workforce townhouse project.\nAnd on the east side of Broadway, Related Urban and the Related Group have secured development sites in the city-owned, 90-acre Marina Village area for\nResidences at Marina Village\n(a 149-unit workforce housing project) and\nGallery at Marina Village\n(a 418-unit market-rate project).\nThe Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency is still entertaining additional development proposals at Marina Village after elected city officials\ndeclared a do-over\nin July after most developers sent incomplete applications for a previous request for qualifications. Anyone interested in building on publicly-owned waterfront land has until Nov. 18 to submit plans and qualifications.Related Urban, the only bidder to submit a completed application in July, will present plans to build a condo-hotel with food and beverage establishments, a Related Urban spokesman previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. Robert Sonnenblick, chairman of Pacific Palisades, California-based Sonnenblick Development, said he wants to build a two-phased project that will include a\n150-room Compass by Margaritaville hotel\n.",

        "content": "A Malibu estate home to the Malibu Rocky Oaks vineyard is on the auction block.\nThe property, which spans nearly 38 acres, could go to a buyer at a $21 million reserve price, Realtor.com\nreported\n. The estate includes 5 acres of\nvineyards\nwhere the Malibu Rocky Oaks wine brand grows 10 grape varietals for red, white and ros\u00e9 offerings.\nMalibu Rocky Oaks was founded in 2003 by Howard Leight Sr. His son Howard Leight Jr. now runs the business. The Leights bought the property in 2005 for $3.5 million, per Realtor.com.\nIn the more than two decades since then, new local laws have prevented the opening of new wineries in the area, making the Rocky Oaks property that much more of a rare purchase. The sale would include the estate\u2019s grapes and irrigation sales, though a new owner wouldn\u2019t get ownership of the Malibu Rocky Oaks brand.\nThe family has been trying to sell the property since 2012 when it first hit the market for $43 million. The property went on and off the market several times after that and was even available for rent. It was\nlast listed in 2022\nfor $49.5 million.\nThe estate\u2019s Tuscan-style main house, built in 2009, sits on a hilltop and comes complete with a stone exterior and red tile roof, both essential in creating a natural fire resistance.\n\nThe 7,665-square-foot manse boasts classic Italian-inspired touches like stone fireplaces, wrought-iron balustrades and beamed ceilings as well as contemporary features like tall ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. It contains five bedrooms and five bathrooms, including a primary suite with its own fireplace and private terrace.\nA rooftop terrace tops off the house, while a deck wraps around much of the exterior. Elsewhere outside, the home has an infinity-edge pool with a hot tub. Reality TV fans might recognize the property from \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and\n\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a one-of-a-kind property in which modern approvals for an estate of this scale and location would be next to impossible,\u201d Chris Cortazzo of Compass, who is helping handle the sale, said in a statement, per Realtor.com.\nThe online auction for the home is now open and ends Oct. 30, barring the seller accepting a bid before the deadline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "At first glance, the\nsale of 346 Madison Avenue\nto SL Green didn\u2019t seem to involve RFR. But Aby Rosen\u2019s firm is seeking damages after allegedly doing significant due diligence on the property, only for that information to apparently facilitate the sale to another party.\nRFR filed a lawsuit Monday in New York County Supreme Court, The Promote\nreported\n. The company is suing the selling ownership entities, led by Luxottica heir and former Brooks Brothers CEO Claudio Del Vecchio, for unspecified damages.\nThe saga dates back to before the pandemic, when Del Vecchio started looking to offload the Brooks Brothers store at 346 Madison alongside an adjacent office building at 11 East 44th Street. They were put up for sale in 2021, according to the suit, via JLL.\nAfter struggling to sell the properties, RFR claims to have come on the scene, conducting extensive due diligence on a site mired by difficult zoning and capitalization issues. It allegedly reached an exclusivity and confidentiality agreement with the seller and shared information from its due diligence.\nThere was even a purchase and sale agreement put in place, according to the lawsuit. But after an exclusivity term expired, the agreement was allegedly \u201cduplicated into the name of another buyer and executed.\u201d RFR didn\u2019t name the buyer, but it likely didn\u2019t have to, as SL Green entered into contract on a $160 million acquisition at the start of this month.\n\nRFR alleges its confidential data was uploaded to a third-party site accessible to competitors, a breach that allowed SL Green to quickly scoop up a deal after RFR\u2019s exclusivity window closed. RFR likened the breach to a \u201cTrojan Horse.\u201d\nJLL listing broker David Giancola allegedly used RFR\u2019s interest in the property to \u201csqueeze out value\u201d from the deal, but Giancola is not listed as a defendant in the case.\nRFR declined to comment on the lawsuit to The Promote. Del Vecchio could not immediately be reached by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the lawsuit may affect SL Green\u2019s plans for a ground-up office development steps away from Grand Central Terminal; the site could house an 800,000-square-foot project. It\u2019s adjacent to 350 Madison Avenue, a 400,000-square-foot property owned by none other than RFR.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The listing works out to $2,230 per square foot.\nThe move comes more than eight months after lender First Foundation Bank accused Cosby of defaulting on a $17.5 million loan tied to the 13,000-square-foot home. The bank claims he stopped making payments on the debt and owes more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nCosby and his wife, Camille, bought the limestone manse in 1990 for $6.3 million. Known as the Luyster Mansion, the residence dates to 1899 and is packed with period flourishes, from mahogany floors to an original elevator that still connects nearly every level.\nThe six-bedroom property boasts a dining room that seats 30, multiple suites, a roof garden and a parlor level for entertaining.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider has the\nlisting\n, which marks the first time the property has hit the market in more than 35 years.\n\nThe 71st Street property isn\u2019t Cosby\u2019s only Manhattan fire drill.\nIn April, he listed another townhouse, a four-story property at 243 East 61st Street once used by his late son Ennis, for $7 million. That asking price was cut to $6.75 million in July. CitiMortgage accused Cosby and his wife of defaulting on a $4.2 million loan tied to that home and is\npursuing foreclosure\n.\nThe foreclosure suits are only the latest legal headaches for Cosby. His sexual assault conviction was overturned in 2021, but he continues to face fresh claims, including one in January accusing the actor of drugging and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in Las Vegas in the 1980s.\nThese days, Bill and Camille primarily live outside Philadelphia, where they paid $225,000 for a suburban estate in the 1980s before \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d elevated the comedian to new heights.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Richard Elias signed the deed on behalf of the seller. The Miami Beach-based law firm Kellermann Varela is listed for the buyer.\nThe six-bedroom, four-bathroom house spans more than 5,000 square feet of interior space on a quarter-acre lot.

That total was already the second-highest ever, behind 2022\u2019s record 136. If momentum holds, 2025 is on track to\nchallenge\nor top that peak.\nMuch of the action is in Winnetka, where @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay has\ndominated\nthe leaderboard, repping one side or both in five of the year\u2019s top six deals. The suburb notched the year\u2019s headline-grabber: a 22-room lakefront estate that went for over $31 million, the highest price ever paid for an existing home in the Chicago area. Radnay told the outlet that Winnetka\u2019s mix of investment value and lifestyle draw buyers fast when properties enter the market.\nChicago itself has notched a\nmajority\nof the high-ticket sales this year. A Gold Coast condo crossed the $10 million mark, and Ken Griffin quietly sold two unfinished Gold Coast floors for a combined $15.9 million \u2014 deals that could end up ranking higher once ownership details are clarified. So far this year, 64 of the 109 luxury sales have been in Chicago.\n\nThe run isn\u2019t just about wealth cushioning buyers from inflation. Radnay said families are betting on long-term appreciation and paying premiums for lakefront security. Carrie McCormick of @properties Christie\u2019s said that scarcity drives urgency.\nThere\u2019s still potential reshuffling ahead, with a pair of pending suburban sales near $15 million in Kenilworth and Lake Forest. Even so, nothing comes close to Winnetka\u2019s record-setter.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market has come a long\nway\nsince the 2010s, when $4M deals averaged around 50 a year. Prices have swelled in the 2020s, with Redfin data showing the metro\u2019s median home price up 73 percent since 2019.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The proverb \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is not my friend\u201d does not apply to the controversy around\nTexas\u2019 House Bill 21\n.\nThe affordable housing reform law meant to close the state\u2019s \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation loophole has been heavily\ncriticized by the same people who advocated for reform\n. But the law\u2019s detractors aren\u2019t all on board with a\nlawsuit challenging HB 21\nthat was filed last week.\nThe lawsuit exacerbated the drama, since one of the entities that brought it is affiliated with Post Investment Group, which has used the traveling housing finance corporations loophole. Meaning the firm got tax credits on apartment complexes by partnering with housing finance corporations in counties other than where the properties are located.\nThis divisive Texas law has politicians and developers squabbling in a climate where real estate often gets what it wants from the legislature, but in this case, real estate is divided.\nIt\u2019s a Venn Diagram with three circles representing Rep. Gary Gates and his HB 21, affordable housing developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole and developers who partook of traveling tax credits.\nThe first two overlap in their opposition to the affordable housing scheme. But the next two overlap in their opposition to HB 21, meaning developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole oppose Gates, his law and the group of developers who used the loophole.\n\u201cThey screwed this up for people doing in-jurisdictional deals,\u201d Waterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman said of developers that used the loophole. But he also opposes HB 21, which he argues is \u201canti-Texas\u201d for undermining local control and the decisions of local housing authorities.\nWaterford belongs in the second circle, and Drachman has been raising the red flag about the loophole for over a year.\nThe lawsuit was brought by Texas Workforce Housing Coalition and an affiliate of Post, the ground lease tenant of a San Antonio apartment complex that is a traveling housing finance corporation deal. It aims to legitimize these cross-juridictional deals, emphasizing that Chapter 394 expressly allows these kinds of deals and claims they were affirmed by governmental bodies, including appraisal districts.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to craft a story of victimhood for both them and their partners and lenders and tenants especially that is just patently false,\u201d Drachman said.\nIn particular, he has a problem with the lawsuit\u2019s claim that HB 21 \u201cwill cause mass evictions of teachers, nurses and first responders.\u201d That\u2019s a lie, he said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t comply, you don\u2019t get property tax exemptions. Then you have to pay your property taxes. I don\u2019t know why that would lead to mass evictions,\u201d he said.\nThe argument behind the lawsuit\u2019s contention is that if developers lose properties due to increased tax bills, new ownership could raise rents.\nDrachman concedes there\u2019s merit to the lawsuit\u2019s argument that HB 21 violates the Texas Constitution by affecting contracts already in place. HB 21 creates new affordability requirements for future housing finance corporations deals and requires that prior deals, including those that used the loophole, come into compliance with the stricter standards.\nHB 21 is the result of a campaign to outlaw traveling housing finance corporations. But the legislation that ended up getting signed was so divisive that it made enemies out of the loudest voices pushing for reform of the program.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Gates, who is a multifamily operator in Houston, has repeatedly called the arguments of his detractors \u201cred herrings,\u201d treating the loophole-using developers and the developers who didn\u2019t use it as the same group.\nGates\u2019 office said he wouldn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n",

New York-based Sculptor Capital Management provided the rest of the financing.\nThe package likely marks the largest condo construction financing in Tampa.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads, led by Taylor Collins and Reid Boren secured the debt for the Pendry Tampa and Pendry Residences\nTampa\n, which will have a 220-key Pendry hotel and a 207-unit condo component. The condo portion is more than 60 percent presold with more than $300 million in presales, according to the release.\nCondo prices range from $1.8 million to $5.8 million, excluding penthouses, according to a spokesperson.\n\nConstruction is underway on the fourth floor of the planned 38-story tower, which fronts the Hillsborough River. Amenities will include waterfront restaurants, more than 10,000 square feet of conference and ballroom space, a 14,000-square-foot spa and a fitness center.\nC-PACE stands for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, which encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. The Pendry project is being built more than 11 feet above sea level. The building\u2019s HVAC system and the design of the structure will save 55,701 lifetime metric tons of carbon, according to a press release from Nuveen. That\u2019s equivalent to the annual energy use of 7,500 homes in the U.S.\nThe project was once slated to become\nTrump Tower Tampa\nunder a different group of developers, the Tampa Bay Times previously reported.\nIn South Florida,\nTwo Roads\nand its partner, Alpha Blue Ventures,\nrecently completed\nFort\u00e9 on Flagler, a 25-story, 40-unit condo project in West Palm Beach. Nearly all the units were presold for a combined $289.1 million at the time the building was completed.\nTwo Roads\u2019 track record in the region is complicated by litigation surrounding its planned Edition Residences condo project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\u00a0In July, the Third District Court of Appeal\nruled in favor\nof a group of eight holdout owners who have been fighting the buyout of their condo building, Biscayne 21, for years. In 2022, Two Roads Development paid\nabout $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront 192-unit building, on the site where it plans to build Edition Residences. The following year, the holdout owners sued over the developer-controlled condo association amending the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. Two Roads has said it plans to take the issue to the Florida Supreme Court.\n",

        "content": "A Hinsdale mansion brought in the highest sale price in the wealthy Chicago suburb in over a year, even after taking a 20 percent cut from its asking price.\nExcluding lakefront North Shore towns, the Elm Street deal in Hinsdale marks the priciest inland suburban home sale so far this year in Chicagoland, aside from a\nBarrington home featured in the hit TV show \u201cEmpire\u201d\nthat sold for $6.5 million. Yet that deal only closed after the home spent a dozen years on the market and originally listed for nearly $16 million.\nThe Hinsdale mansion at 818 South Elm Street, with seven bedrooms and eight-and-a-half bathrooms, sold for $5.9 million on Sept. 11. The 16,000-square-foot home sits on a tree-lined 1.27-acre lot that includes a swimming pool.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s\nDawn McKenna\nand Lauren Walz represented the property\u2019s seller, and Alexandra Shaban of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented the buyer. Both declined to comment on the deal. The house was previously owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity. The buyer is not yet reflected in public property documents.\n\nThe South Elm Street house was initially\nlisted at $7.3 million\nin August 2024, testing the upper end of the market for the high-end western suburb. It came off the public market in December 2024 and was not listed publicly again before selling.\nThe ultimate sale price of $5.9 million makes it the most expensive sale of the year in Hinsdale and among the priciest so far this year in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs. The last Hinsdale sale to surpass the Elm Street home\u2019s price closed in June 2024.\nHinsdale was ranked the 8th wealthiest suburb in the U.S. according to a July GOBankRates analysis,\nThe Real Deal reported\n. It had the highest year-over-year home value growth among the country\u2019s wealthiest suburbs in May 2025, with the total average home value reaching about $1.2 million on an 8 percent year-over-year gain.\nMany of the top western suburban sales this year have been in Hinsdale, including a $4.9 million house on South Park Avenue, a $4.7 million estate on County Line Road and a $4.5 million house on East 6th Street.\nTwo homes have fetched prices above $7 million in Hinsdale: A\n17,600 square-foot mansion\nsold for a record $7.7 million in 2021, and an off-market sale\nbrought in $7.5 million in 2022\n.",

Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments got approval on its planned 203-unit project at 400 Divisadero Street in 2017.\n\u201cThe original approvals were based on the building code standards of 2016,\u201d Mahmood told the Chronicle. \u201cThey have to keep going back and\nchanging the project\n.\u201d\nUnder current regulations, San Francisco\u2019s building code requires projects to adhere to the building code in place when they break ground, rather than when the application was filed. The\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been stalled for nine years, and the building codes change every three. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans.\nIn the years since then, codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy have made projects such as these less feasible, tacking on an additional 5 percent to 7 percent of costs, according to the Chronicle. By using the regulations in place in 2016, the developer would save approximately $4 million on the project.\n\u201cWe wanted to see if we could solve the housing death spiral in which each delay results in other delays, compounding the problem,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nThe project calls for 203 units to be built in six stories on the Touchless Car Wash site, including approximately 20 set aside for affordable housing. Mahmood\u2019s proposed legislation would reduce hurdles to getting shovels into dirt.\n\u201cAt a minimum what it does is gives us a little bit of relief in lower construction costs,\u201d 4Terra partner Amir Massih told the Chronicle. \u201cHaving somebody in City Hall advocating on your behalf is a welcome change from the past.\u201d\nUncertainty still remains a factor as tariffs could threaten to increase already high construction costs and equity partners are wary of investing in housing projects. But if the stars align and Mahmood\u2019s legislation allows the project to stick to its original application plans, groundbreaking on the project could happen next year, Massih told the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The plans from Frontier Group call for a 29-story tower rising approximately 300 feet and replacing a partially vacant two-story building on a narrow lot.\nThe project was first proposed in 2019, when the local lodging market was flourishing, but the pandemic ground that pace practically to a halt.\nChelsea Pacific Group, the owner of the historic seven-story Chancery Building next door to the proposed hotel, fought against the plan.\nChelsea Pacific argued that Frontier Group\u2019s planned hotel would be so close to the Chancery Building\u2019s side windows that it would block sunlight, decrease privacy and make it harder for the firm to find tenants for offices. It also pointed out the effects of noise, dust, air pollution and vibration caused by construction that can damage property. The building\u2019s office space is 96 percent leased \u2014 a notable success with the city\u2019s second-quarter office vacancy rate at 35.7 percent, according to JLL.\n\nChelsea Pacific submitted an economic analysis earlier this summer saying a new hotel isn\u2019t needed and would hurt existing hotels, but Frontier Group\u2019s analysis, completed by CBRE\u2019s hotel advisory group, said the proposed hotel will likely enter a \u201cstrong and viable\u201d market.\nSan Francisco visitor spending fell from $9.6 billion in 2019 to $2.7 billion in 2020, while the number of visitors dropped from 26.2 million to 11.8 million. Tourists have started flocking back, but tourism levels haven\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Tourism is expected to rise over the next year, with 23.5 million visitors projected this year, according to San Francisco Travel Association.\nHotel occupancy is projected to reach 65.2 percent this year and 66.3 percent next year. In the year before the pandemic, the rate was at 82.7 percent.\nHotel properties in San Francisco\nand across the Bay Area have seen better days. Hotel owners have fallen into\nloan default\nor faced\nforeclosure\n, bankruptcy,\ndepressed sale value\nand closure as the market gets back on its feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "H-E-B\u2019s long-awaited arrival inside Dallas city limits isn\u2019t getting the warm welcome the Texas grocer is accustomed to.\nThe San Antonio-based grocery chain is facing opposition over plans for a 127,000-square-foot store on nearly\n10 acres\nalong Interstate 635 at Hillcrest Road, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The company bought the land earlier this year, sparking celebration among shoppers who trek miles to reach the nearest H-E-B. But the site requires a zoning change from low-rise commercial to regional retail, which would allow a building up to 70 feet tall with heavy lot coverage \u2014 a scale that some neighbors say doesn\u2019t fit.\nSupporters argue the store would fill a\ngap\nin North Dallas retail options. Some residents praised H-E-B\u2019s reputation as a civic-minded operator and said traffic concerns were being exaggerated.\nBut homeowner groups are rallying against the project, citing congestion, truck loading zones and design issues. The Hillcrest Forest Neighborhood Association, which has circulated petitions, called the store \u201cout of character\u201d with the area and warned it could dump 6,000 additional cars onto an already busy intersection.\n\nThe pushback is consistent with a \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d streak that has shaped development battles in affluent North Dallas. Similar concerns have derailed or delayed projects like the Pepper Square\nredevelopment\n3 miles north. This latest fight is less about H-E-B itself than the scale of the plan \u2014 most H-E-B stores sit on 20 acres, double the proposed footprint. Some have suggested the grocer relocate to the former Valley View mall site 2 miles away, a sprawling 110-acre property already zoned for retail.\nMabrie Jackson, H-E-B\u2019s public affairs director, said the company has met with neighbors since January and is committed to being \u201ca good neighbor.\u201d The rezoning request heads to the Dallas City Plan Commission this week before reaching Dallas City Council. If approved, construction could still be years out \u2014 with 2028 pegged as the earliest opening date.\nH-E-B\u2019s growing presence since the grocer entered Dallas-Fort Worth in 2022 has driven competitors such as Walmart, Kroger and Tom Thumb to increase their investments in the region. Kroger also\nsignaled\nits own North Texas expansion plans with four new stores announced last month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Months after reports emerged of\na sublease deal in the works\n, Cond\u00e9 Nast finally found a taker for 192,000 square feet at 1 World Trade Center.\nThe Bank of New York is subleasing the huge swath of space from the publishing giant at the Financial District tower, the New York Post\nreported\n. The bank plans to occupy the four floors for four years as it renovates its headquarters at 240 Greenwich Avenue.\nDiscussions over a possible sublease deal were reported by the Commercial Observer back in May. Further details about the financial arrangement were\nnot disclosed\n.\nJLL represented BNY in the sublease deal, while CBRE\u2019s Scott Gottlieb represented the publisher. Newmark also gave building co-owners The Durst Organization and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey a seat at the table.\nCond\u00e9 Nast will need to figure out a strategy for the space four years down the line, as its lease doesn\u2019t expire until the end of the next decade. Cond\u00e9 leases 1.2 million square feet in the 104-story, 3.1 million-square-foot building, but started subleasing space almost immediately after moving in.\n\nSince 2019, more than 230,000 square feet had been claimed by subtenants before this latest agreement. Last year, financial advisory firm Kroll\nleased 48,000 square feet\nfrom the publisher on a 10-year deal with an asking price of $59 per square foot.\nCond\u00e9 publicly fought with its landlords at one point, withholding $2.4 million in rent after the onset of the pandemic as it attempted to renegotiate its lease. It ultimately paid the amount owed in full.\nIn May, Durst made the 89th and 90th floors\navailable to lease\n, the first time they\u2019re being marketed to office tenants. The landlord is looking to capitalize on the sky-high floors and garner rents in the ballpark of $160 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Factory in Long Island City has landed in special servicing, another sign of distress in New York\u2019s outer-borough office market.\nThe $300 million loan tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot office property at 30-30 47th Avenue was sent to special servicing this month for \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d according to Morningstar Credit. The debt comes due in October after several extensions.\nThe owners, a group led by Midtown-based Atlas Capital Group, were current on their payments through August, according to Morningstar. The loan had not previously been delinquent, but the building\u2019s financials have steadily worsened. Operating expenses have climbed every year since the loan originated in 2020. At the same time, income has eroded.\nOccupancy stood at just over 73 percent as of the second quarter. That\u2019s\ndown from\n83 percent in 2020. The largest tenant, Macy\u2019s marketing department, occupies 146,000 square feet across three floors, according to CoStar data. Other tenants include the New York City School Construction Authority, Tourneau and Polo Ralph Lauren.\nUnder the loan agreement, the borrowers have already exercised three extension options. If they can\u2019t secure new financing, the property could be at risk of default.\n\nOriginally built in 1926 as a Macy\u2019s furniture warehouse, Atlas Capital, Invesco and Square Mile Capital Management acquired the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2013. They invested more than $90 million to redevelop it into creative office space with large floor plates, high ceilings and Class A amenities. In 2018, Partners Group invested in the complex by buying a portion of Square Mile\u2019s stake in a deal that valued the property at\n$400 million\n.\nIn 2020, the owners secured a\n$300 million\nCMBS loan from Credit Suisse subsidiary Column Financial. In July, Moody\u2019s downgraded the mortgage from AAA, to the equivalent of AA+, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nA representative for Atlas Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Partners Group declined to comment.\nWhile Manhattan\u2019s trophy towers have led a recent wave of leasing activity, outer-borough landlords have struggled to land tenants. Long Island City\u2019s availability rate hovered just below 27 percent in the first half of 2025, according to CBRE, compared to Manhattan\u2019s overall availability rate of 17.5 percent.\n",

        "content": "After months of deriding everyone and everything from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass to proposed wildfire recovery bills, Spencer Pratt is turning his focus to another piece of controversial legislation.\nThe reality TV personality has taken to social media to call out Senate Bill 79, the recently approved measure that would upzone areas near transit hubs to increase density, Politico\nreported\n.\nThe bill\npassed the California Senate last week\nand is headed to Newsom\u2019s desk. It calls for boosting housing density across the state by allowing apartment buildings of up to nine stories next to train stations and major transit stops. Most cities in California have zoned the land around transit stops for single-family homes.\nPratt\nblasted\nthe bill on Instagram, sharing a video of the January wildfires that\ndestroyed his Pacific Palisades home\nand urging followers to \u201cCall Newsom and tell him Palisades can\u2019t have more density\u201d and to \u201cStop SB 79.\u201d\nThere are no train stations or major transit hubs in the Pacific Palisades. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill, noted the concern over a non-issue for Pratt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s spreading a bald-faced lie, saying that SB 79 applies in the Palisades,\u201d Wiener told Politico. \u201cIt does not, and that is shameful.\u201d\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council passed a resolution expressing opposition to the plan with the support of Mayor Karen Bass. The bill ended up passing in the state legislature last week.\n\nPrior to the SB 79 outrage, Pratt criticized Senate Bill 549, which would establish a government body to determine a path forward after January\u2019s deadly wildfires. Opponents such as Pratt argued it would allow Los Angeles County to take over burned lots and sell them to the highest bidder.\n\u201cThe Hills\u201d star expressed his disdain for SB 549 in a series of videos on\nTikTok\n. He claimed he consulted with an artificial intelligence chatbot that told him the bill would allow L.A. County to buy burned lots in the Palisades and convert them into low-income housing, remove local zoning decisions and push for denser reconstruction in the area. That bill was\npaused in the legislature\nafter Bass raised concerns about its effects.\n\u201cInstead of a [recovery] plan to make the city affordable for its residents, we have Spencer Pratt influencing the mayor of L.A. to kill housing,\u201d Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY, told Politico.\nPratt also criticized Senate Bill 9, which was signed into law in 2021. The legislation was meant to address the state\u2019s housing shortage by allowing homeowners in most single-family residential zones to split their lot into separate parcels and build two units on a single lot. Following Pratt and Bass\u2019\ncriticism\nof the law, Newsom waived its enforcement in fire-prone areas.\nIt remains to be seen whether Newsom will sign SB 79 into law. As for Pratt\u2019s influence on the governor, it appears to be nonexistent.\n\u201cOur office doesn\u2019t communicate with Spencer Pratt,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the governor knows who he is.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Multifamily developers are getting their ducks in a row in Chicagoland, overcoming a tight market for raising equity and landing construction loans to take advantage of a limited construction pipeline.\nWill Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm Continuum Capital became the latest to take major steps toward getting a project out of the ground this week with a $31.2 million acquisition of\nChurch Street Plaza\nin downtown Evanston, a retail center eyed for redevelopment into a 27-story, 358-apartment tower. The deal was funded by a $26.5 million loan from Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital.\nTheir development venture, which also includes Aaron and Amy Galvin\u2019s firm Luxury Living, bought the 145,000-square-foot property from a venture of retail developer\nMitch Goltz\n, who acquired it in 2019 by assuming the remainder of a loan that a previous owner had taken out on the building. Goltz renovated the property and began leasing it up, then refinanced it with a $19.5 million loan from Old National Bank in 2023, public records show. It is 98 percent leased today.\nThe deal adds momentum to the Chicago-area apartment development pipeline, which has shrunk in recent years due to the rising costs of building materials and debt, plus a difficult environment for fundraising to make real estate acquisitions and capitalize construction projects. The result has been upward pressure on Midwest rents in existing buildings, which has drawn interest to the region from more institutional buyers.\nBut developers have begun reigniting the market in recent weeks.\nIn Chicago\u2019s West Loop,\nTim Anderson\u2019s firm Focus Development\n, along with partners DAC Developments and Melrose Ascension Capital, pulled in $96 million in construction financing to build a 287-unit apartment project at 1221 West Washington Street. An office-to-residential conversion project for\n65 East Wacker Place\nin Chicago that\u2019s being led by Adam Friedberg\u2019s firm Mavrek after an acquisition out of distress also scored a $90 million construction financing package.\n\nThe Evanston development team plans to dedicate 72 apartments resulting from the project to Evanston\u2019s affordable housing program by limiting them to households making certain fractions of the area median income.\n\u201cWhile our proposal for 900 Clark Street was not contingent on purchasing Church Street Plaza, this was a compelling opportunity to acquire a high-quality asset in a high-barrier-to-entry location,\u201d Continuum\u2019s co-founder Meador said.\nGoltz, the seller, declined to comment.\nThe Continuum team will work to start pre-construction involving the renovation of the retail into the base of the tower. It will seek a separate construction financing package for the approximately $130 million multifamily project.\nPreviously with\nMichigan Avenue Real Estate Group\n, which is backed by Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Meador helped lead the development of over 1,100 apartments in Chicago\u2019s West Loop and surrounding suburbs, including Evanston, where the firm built Maeve on Ridge, a luxury rental building at 1555 Ridge Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital is nearing the finish line to acquire New York City and San Francisco office landlord Paramount Group, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThis comes after a months-long\nmultiple-round bidding process\n, which included SL Green, Vornado, Blackstone, Empire State Realty and DivcoWest with Dubai-based Saray Capital, sources said.\nThrough the acquisition, Rithm, one of the largest mortgage servicers in the U.S., can expand deeper into commercial real estate amid an acquisition spree.\u00a0The news was first reported in the Wall Street Journal.\nIf the deal goes through, Rithm will take on Paramount\u2019s 17-building office portfolio in New York City and San Francisco, totaling 13 million square feet of space. Among the more notable properties: 1301 Sixth Avenue, 1633 Broadway and 900 Third Avenue in New York City\nParamount announced in May that it hired Bank of America as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives, including the possibility of a sale. The news came as the company and its CEO faced increasing scrutiny.\nParamount revealed earlier this year that it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to Behler\u2019s personal expenses and outside companies over the past three years. This included $900,000 on Behler\u2019s personal accounting services and $3 million on a private jet firm, co-owned by Behler.\nA short time later, an analyst at Green Street Advisors called for the removal of certain Paramount board members, citing management\u2019s high compensation relative to its stock performance.\nIn July, Paramount\ndisclosed it was under an investigation\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission in its second-quarter report.\n\nThe Real Deal\nreported in August that\nBehler personally pushed for a no-bid contract\nto a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager. Text messages reviewed by\nTRD\nshowed Behler and the employee maintained a friendly personal relationship years after their romantic relationship ended. (In those messages, the employee refers to Behler as \u201cAlbertcim,\u201d using a suffix meant to show endearment in the Turkish language, with the term roughly translating to \u201cmy dear Albert.\u201d)\nParamount has also seen an exodus of top employees in recent months. Paramount announced Wilbur Paes, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Gage Johnson, Paramount\u2019s general counsel, left the company.\nParamount was founded in 1978 by German mail-order entrepreneur Werner Otto. Behler was appointed as president and CEO in 1991. The firm went public in 2014 with an initial public offering of $2.3 billion, the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT at the time.\nParamount, like other office landlords, took a hit during the pandemic as occupancy dropped and employees worked from home. But as the office market has rebounded, Paramount\u2019s New York City portfolio is up to 88 percent leased as of its second quarter, the highest mark since 2022. In its most recent quarter, Paramount reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of $19.8 million.\nAs of today, Paramount has a market capitalization of $1.56 billion with its stock price hovering around $7, about half of what the stock was trading at prior to the pandemic.\nWhen the company announced its plan for a possible sale, Behler said the company and board \u201cremain focused closing the persistent gap between the company\u2019s public market valuation and our assessment of its intrinsic value.\u201d\nRithm, which has $36 billion in assets under management, has expanded from a mortgage servicing company. In 2023, it purchased the hedge fund Sculptor Capital Management. More recently, it inked a deal to buy Crestline, a $17 billion private lender.\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach officials are probably wishing they could hit \u201cunsend\u201d on a two-year-old group chat that could boost Nikki Beach Club\u2019s owner\u2019s claims of favoritism against the city.\nPenrod Brothers\n, led by Lucia Penrod, widow of the firm\u2019s late founder Jack Penrod, has a pending lawsuit against Miami Beach. Penrod seeks to overturn the awarding of a new contract for the city-owned property at 1 Ocean Drive that is home to Nikki Beach Club. The 2023 complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also names Penrod\u2019s rival, Boucher Brothers, as a defendant.\nA bid by\nBoucher and Major Food Group\nwon the city\u2019s request for proposals, and the joint venture is set to take control of the property at 1 Ocean Drive next year when Penrod\u2019s current ground lease expires.\nBut dozens of texts by city staffers, recently released via the discovery process, could help Penrod bolster its case that Miami Beach officials violated procurement rules and showed bias in selecting a new operator.\nA text conversation on Sept. 2, 2023 between ex-Miami Beach City Attorney Raul Aguila, current city attorney Ricardo Dopico and chief deputy city attorney Nicholas Kallergis stands out.\nThe thread begins with Aguila texting his former colleagues a link to a\nMiami Herald\narticle detailing how Miami Beach rejected\nPenrod\u2019s bid\nbecause it was submitted 15 minutes after the city\u2019s deadline. \u201cHow STUPID are they???\u201d Aguila wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the dumbass who waited until [2:59 p.m.] to submit. Imagine there\u2019s a malpractice claim there,\u201d Dopico responded.\n\u201cI\u2019m having multiple orgasms just thinking about it. You guys have all the fun!!!!!!,\u201d Aguila replied.\n\u201cOmg for sure that kid is fired,\u201d Kallergis texted.\n\n\u201cWhat a fitting denouement for the Penrod\u2019s saga!\u201d Aguila shot back.\nAguila, who retired from the city in 2022, Dopico and Kallergis did not respond to requests for comment about the texts, which were first reported by\nMiami New Times\n. Daniel Hanlon, a lawyer representing Boucher, did not respond for comment either. A Miami Beach spokesperson declined to comment.\nPrintouts of the text messages were provided to\nThe Real Deal\nby a Miami Beach resident who requested anonymity.\nIn an emailed statement, Penrod said it sought court intervention to \u201crequire the city to hold a fair and lawful process for this public land.\u201d\n\u201cFormer city leaders violated laws requiring public competition which led to the challenge we brought,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe our position is supported by clear law and overwhelming evidence.\u201d\nCity officials faced intense public scrutiny over their handling of the 1 Ocean Drive property\u2019s future. Penrod has controlled the property since the 1980s via its ground lease, and the firm launched Nikki Beach Club in 1997. The name is in honor of late Jack Penrod\u2019s daughter Nicole, who was killed in a car accident the same year the venue was renamed from Penrod\u2019s on the Beach.\nIn April 2023, the Miami Beach City Commission initially voted to negotiate a no-bid deal with\nBoucher\n, which provides beach concessions under a separate city contract, and Major Food Group, the New York-based hospitality firm that owns Carbone and other high-end restaurants.\nA month later, commissioners\nreversed their decision\nafter a wave of public backlash, and voted for a competitive bid process that Boucher and Major Food Group subsequently won. The joint venture is getting a 10-year lease that the city claims will pay Miami Beach $41 million over the life of the agreement.\nDuring the discovery process,\nPenrod\nalso previously obtained emails showing then-Mayor Dan Gelber, then-Vice-Mayor Ricky Arriola and city staffers regularly hit up Boucher and Major Food Group principals for beach chairs and dinner reservations.",

Taylor, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and related charges, and his wife, Alejandra Maria Taylor, sold the 20,182-square-foot mansion at 6555 Southwest 102nd Street to CNEB LLC. The buyer is a Delaware entity that\u2019s tied to a land trust. The buyer financed the purchase with a $13.7 million loan from First Horizon Bank, property records show.\nThe 10-bedroom, 10-and-a-half-bathroom home, on a 2-acre lot,\nwas on the market for $21.8 million\nwith Julian Johnston of the Corcoran Group. Lorena Rodriguez with Serhant represented the buyer, according to the listing.\nIn 2022, Taylor was charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, investment adviser fraud and wire fraud; a separate securities fraud charge, and a separate investment adviser fraud charge. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Taylor, two other former senior portfolio managers at Allianz Global Investors US, and Allianz were involved in a massive investment fraud.\nTaylor pleaded guilty. He reached an agreement with the SEC that bars him from the securities industry and from the brokering or sales/purchases of penny stocks.\n\nThe scheme resulted in the loss of billions of dollars of pension fund money for teachers, clergy, bus drivers, engineers and other working professionals, according to the complaint.\nThe\nPinecrest\nestate, built in 2022, includes a pool deck, spa, cold plunge, a separate 1,000-square-foot gym, a tennis court and more, according to the listing. Taylor and his ex-wife Deborah paid $3.2 million for the property in 2017.\nThe latest sale beats a previous Pinecrest record. Last year, finance executive Andre Hakkak\npaid $14.3 million\nfor the spec mansion at 8900 Southwest 64th Court. Developer Francisco Dionicio\u2019s Dionicio Investment Group sold the property.\nMore recently in June, Major League Baseball pitcher Luis Severino\npaid $10.7 million\nfor the under-construction home at 10801 Southwest 67th Avenue in Pinecrest. The nearly 11,300-square-foot home includes seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a separate guest wing, summer kitchen, three-car garage, pool, sauna and steam room.\n",

The couple bought the property in 2020 in an attempt to revive plans pursued by private developers for decades to build homes at the site.\nThe development started as a large project that was eventually shut down by the City in 2002.

        "content": "A Lake Forest estate that has hosted Chicago\u2019s elite for more than a century \u2014 and played a supporting role in an Oscar-winning film \u2014 is up for grabs for just under $7.5 million.\nDesigned in 1907 by architect Howard Van Doren Shaw and built the same year, the estate is hitting the market for the first time in 30 years, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Shaw\u2019s Georgian red-brick mansion, one of more than 40 he designed in\nLake Forest\n, sits on 2.5 acres at 788 East Woodland Road and spans 7,300 square feet with five bedrooms, formal gardens and sun porches. The asking price equates to $1,030 per square foot.\nThe home served as the set for the 1980 drama \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d directed by the late Robert Redford and starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars. The home\u2019s cameo cemented its place in Hollywood-Chicago lore.\nThe sellers are the heirs of Peggy Crowe, who bought the house with her husband, Jack, in the 1990s. The Crowes preserved the estate\u2019s historic character while adding modern touches, including a pool house by Liederbach &amp; Graham. Compass brokers Marina Carney and Andrew Mrowiec are handling the listing.\n\nDescribing its condition as \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cmeticulous,\u201d Carney told the outlet that all prior owners preserved the early 1900s design touches, including the ornate pine-paneled walls of the living room and limestone floors in the entrance hall. The listing also describes original French doors with restored brass cremone bolts, a garden room with panoramic views of the south lawn, hand-scraped pine floors and custom cabinetry in the kitchen, butler\u2019s pantry and breakfast room and a geothermally-heated swimming pool.\nIf it trades\nabove\n$7 million, the estate will join a small\nclub\nof Lake Forest homes to cross that threshold this decade. Only two have done so in recent years, though another \u2014 an 8-acre spread\nlisted\nat $15 million \u2014 has been under contract since July.\nThe house\u2019s pedigree extends beyond its architecture. Commissioned by banker Leverett Thompson and his wife, Helen, the estate quickly became one of Lake Forest\u2019s \u201cshow places,\u201d with gardens designed by Boston\u2019s Rose Standish Nichols and New York\u2019s Charles Platt. Later owners included members of the Chicago meatpacking dynasty Swift family.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Apartment starts in the region have fallen to just a few hundred per quarter from more than 3,000, per the Business Times. It aligns with a nationwide trend of 542,800 units under construction at the end of the second quarter \u2014 the lowest level in a decade, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nThe project from Bozzuto and Kimco\u2019s joint venture, known as\nThe Chester at Westlake\n, calls for a five-story mixed-use building that will house studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, most of which will come equipped with balconies or terraces. Residents will have access to 13,000 square feet of amenities as well as nearly 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s growing influence on the Bay Area has so far manifested in companies flocking to the region and setting up offices. Employees have followed, bringing in new renters to the Bay Area. With an expected influx of tens of thousands of AI workers over the next five years, office vacancy in San Francisco alone is predicted to be\ncut in half\n, according to CBRE.\nThe AI boom didn\u2019t play a part in The Chester at Westlake\u2019s construction, as Bozzuto began studying the site three years ago.\n\n\u201cI was bullish on Daly City,\u201d Bozzuto president and CEO Toby Bozzuto told the Business Times. \u201cThe AI jobs and the broader resurgence \u2014 that\u2019s just the icing on the cake.\u201d\nBozzuto and\nKimco\nare pursuing the project with financing from J.P. Morgan and a plan to use wood-frame construction and non-union labor as a means of lowering construction costs. In the Bay Area, most apartments are built for about $600,000 per unit, making new multifamily construction unfeasible for many developers.\nCurrent vacancy in San Mateo County is approaching a 20-year low at approximately 4 percent, per CoStar data cited by the Business Times. Rents, meanwhile, have risen 5 percent in the past year \u2014 the quickest spike since 2022.\nThe Chester at Westlake is scheduled to open by the end of 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Frost Bank is jumping ahead of the Federal Reserve by lowering mortgage rates and waiving some fees in a bid to grab market share across Texas.\nThe San Antonio-based bank rolled out a 50-basis-point cut on conventional and jumbo mortgages effective Sept. 8, bringing its 30-year fixed conventional rate to 6 percent, 15-year conventional to 5 percent, and both 30- and 15-year jumbo products to 5.75 percent.\nThe lender is also waiving up to $1,200 in administrative fees for all conventional and jumbo borrowers. Its Progress Mortgage division, geared toward low- and moderate-income borrowers, is priced at 5.75 percent and already carries a fee waiver, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe timing is notable: on Sept. 15, Bankrate pegged the average national 30-year fixed\nmortgage\nannual percentage rate at 6.39 percent and refinance APR at 6.73 percent. No other Texas lender has matched Frost\u2019s rate and fee package so far, though analysts expect broader declines after the Fed\u2019s Sept. 16\u201317 meeting.\n\u201cInstead of waiting for the Fed or the markets, we decided to lower the cost barrier for potential homebuyers or refinancers now,\u201d said Bill Day, senior vice president at Frost.\nThe math could help some potential home buyers\npull the trigger\non a purchase.\n\u201cOver the last 30 days, I\u2019m quoting 6 to 6.25 percent on conventional and FHA/VA loans, down from 6.75 to 7 percent,\u201d Brian Gutierrez of NEO Home Loans in San Antonio told the outlet.\n\nGutierrez said he is seeing a surge in first-time buyers targeting homes under $400,000, spurred by easing rates and seller concessions. In San Antonio, the average market time is 88 days \u2014 a 14-day increase from the San Antonio Board of Realtors\u2019 July report \u2014 and sellers are\noffering\n$7,500 to $12,000 in closing cost assistance.\nGutierrez said refinances are also climbing \u2014 up 42 percent year-over-year statewide, according to ATTOM Data Solutions \u2014 as borrowers look to shed debt and lock in savings. But he noted that high credit card balances, a byproduct of prolonged high interest rates, are still sidelining some would-be refinancers.\nFrost just jumped back into the mortgage business last year. The bank focuses on in-house servicing and is positioning itself as a market leader, Day said.\nFrost might have forced a rate war if competitors follow suit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Building New York City real estate is never easy. But some projects are more difficult than others.\nAfter years of hurdles, a 144-unit affordable and senior housing project in Forest Hills, Queens, has secured financing and is set to break ground. TD Bank loaned $37.5 million for construction, while Community Preservation Corp is providing a $40 million long-term loan. On the public side, the city is providing $71 million from a program for senior housing.\n\u201cAs an affordable housing developer, I\u2019ve never seen anything as difficult as this,\u201d said Jeff Fox, of Foxy Development, which is co-developing the project. \u201cNothing about this was easy.\u201d\nFrom conception to construction, the project changed plans several times. The property at 70-35 113th Street, dubbed The Perennial, is the site of an abandoned hospital. It was upzoned in 2020 with an agreement that it would include a certain amount of senior affordable housing.\nTypically, developers in these upzoned areas build their affordable and market-rate apartments in one building, with the market-rate units subsidizing the affordable units. But because of a complex ownership structure, the two portions of the project were kept separate, allowing Fox\u2019s team to pursue public financing for a fully affordable development while a market-rate development next door can still take advantage of the upzoning.\nAt one point, the Perennial was envisioned as a fully senior housing development, financed by tax-exempt state bonds, according to Fox. But that plan fell through, and the team scrapped their designs for 20 non-senior affordable units. The city provided funds, pledging money from its Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program.\n\nThe backstory of the financing lines up with promises of increased public-private partnerships touted by Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor. Mamdani has proposed tripling the city\u2019s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable housing. Fox said there were many times the Department of Housing Preservation and Development could have walked away from the deal, but officials wanted to make something happen despite setbacks and an out-of-the-box structure.\n\u201cThis is a part of Queens where we have long wanted to build more affordable housing,\u201d said Ahmed Tigani, acting commissioner of HPD. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need every part of the city to help build housing for the people who need it.\u201d\nThe plan is now to redevelop the interior of the hospital building while adding two stories on top. A section of the building will be carved out as the future home of the Forest Hills Jewish Center. The units will be available to households earning up to 50 percent of the area median income. HPD is also providing a rental subsidy through federal Section 8 funds. Of the 124 senior units, 20 will be set aside for formerly homeless seniors.\nServices for seniors will be provided by co-developer Selfhelp Realty Group, which focuses on senior housing. The Forest Hills site will be the company\u2019s first intergenerational property.\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity to start to look at something that we see as a priority for the city, moving more toward intergenerational housing,\u201d said Lisa Trub, executive director of Selfhelp. \u201cWe do think that we can kind of replicate a similar model and not be totally reliant on HPD financing.\u201d\nThe market rate development next door, which is owned separately and which the Fox and Selfhelp teams are not involved with, will be 13 stories and 241 units. TopRock Capital and RJ Holdings\nsecured $125 million last year\nto build condos on the site.\n",

        "content": "Continuing our \u201c\nEducating Zohran\n\u201d series\u2026\nToday, we offer more evidence that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to build affordable housing for $500,000 per unit (with union workers) is off by a factor of two.\nThe latest examples are the $150 million redevelopment of Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, which will yield 145 units of affordable and senior housing, and New Destiny Housing\u2019s $57 million Bronx development with 72 units, including 43 for domestic violence survivors.\nThe Queens project at 70-35 113th Street, by Jeff Fox\u2019s Foxy Development and Selfhelp Realty Group, also includes space for a Jewish center, so we can\u2019t just divide the total cost by the unit count to get a per-unit cost. But clearly, it\u2019s a lot more than $500,000. The typical cost of nonunion-built affordable housing in the city is about $800,000 per unit.\nMamdani\u2019s union construction would cost more, if affordable housing developers actually built that way. Which they don\u2019t.\nAs is customary with affordable housing, funding for the Queens and Bronx developments was patched together over several years from a plethora of sources.\nFoxy got a $37.5 million construction loan from TD Bank, a $40.1 million permanent loan from\nCommunity Preservation Corporation\n, a $70.7 million loan from HPD\u2019s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program, $18.24 million in federal HOME funds, and $3.625 million from state agency Homes and Community Renewal. Construction begins Wednesday.\nNew Destiny\u2019s project, which broke ground last week on Webster Avenue, includes $25 million from HPD\u2019s Supportive Housing Loan Program, $16 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, and $9.7 million from the OTDA\u2019s Homeless Housing and Assistance Program.\nIf you\u2019re not up on your acronyms, OTDA is the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. New Destiny also got help from the Corporation for Supportive Housing and Deutsche Bank\u2019s supportive housing arm.\nThis complicated array of funding sources, each of which takes time and comes with fees, is one reason affordable projects cost\nmore\nthan market-rate development.\nMamdani says he would simply issue $70 billion in bonds to pay for his housing. That would be simpler and more efficient, but not enough to cut per-unit costs in half. Regardless, a bond issuance of that size would require state approval, which is extremely unlikely.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s former counsel, Liz Fine, explained why in a\nrefreshingly honest op-ed\nlast week: \u201cThe government builds roads, bridges, public buildings, infrastructure, and even housing. But it is wildly expensive for the government to build housing and so at the end of the day, we need to rely on private developers.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nContrary to the common sentiment that rents never go down, in the nation\u2019s 50 largest metro areas, the median asking rent for units with two or fewer bedrooms dropped 2.2 percent year-over-year in August to $1,713, and is down 2.6 percent from the August 2022 peak, according to\nRealtor.com\n. That\u2019s 25 consecutive months of annual declines.

        "content": "Rental apartments were harder to come by this summer in the wake of New York City\u2019s ban on broker fees.\nAcross the five boroughs, the number of rental listings fell in June, July and August compared to their year-ago totals, according to data provided by the Real Estate Board of New York. The trade group\u2019s analysis was based on all listings available on its residential listing service during the periods.\n\u201cThe FARE Act has created chaos and confusion in the residential rental market, is diminishing choice for tenants, increasing rents and costing the industry jobs,\u201d REBNY president James Whelan wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is bad policy, and it is only getting worse.\u201d\nInventory dropped 16 percent in June, the same month\nthe city implemented the FARE Act\nbarring landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired, according to REBNY\u2019s analysis.\nIn the months following the policy\u2019s enactment, the dip became even more pronounced. Inventory decreased 23 percent in July and 29 percent in August, according to data from the organization. As fewer apartments hit the market, prices rose on an annual basis in each of the three months, up 7 percent in June and July and 11 percent in August.\nHowever, the inventory problem is likely less dire than the trade group\u2019s analysis reflects. Other groups, such as data analytics platform UrbanDigs, have lamented that rental data has been\nharder to track\nwith fewer listings hitting the RLS. Other data sources, such as StreetEasy, capture a larger swatch of apartments and include citywide numbers that are, in some cases, more than three times the figures REBNY reported.\nData from StreetEasy also shows a decline in inventory across the city, though its metrics indicated a more gradual reduction, with inventory falling just 2 percent in June, 11 percent in July and 9 percent in August.\nManhattan logged the most substantial decrease, with inventory dipping 7 percent in June, 18 percent in July and 13 percent in August, according to data from StreetEasy. But apartment listings in Brooklyn and Queens remained much steadier, with both boroughs notching small upticks in June followed by modest declines between 2 percent and 5 percent in the following two months.\n\u201cThis was more about optics than it was about the actual impacts,\u201d Corcoran\u2019s chief operating officer Gary Malin said of the law, which he described as decreasing transparency in the market and making it harder for tenants to find apartments on their own. \u201cThey\u2019re taking the industry back to before the internet.\u201d\nTight market squeezes brokers, renters\nThough REBNY largely attributes the upset to the FARE Act, other factors are likely at play, especially in Manhattan, where competition for apartments was already tight, according to a\nreport from StreetEasy\npublished earlier this summer.\nWhile rent prices are on the rise, in part due to landlords attempting to offset the cost of broker fees, the same market constrictions contributing to the drop in inventory are also pushing prices higher. In New York City, the struggle with\nhousing affordability\nis a longstanding issue that predates the new legislation, and other laws, such as\nGood Cause Eviction\n, have a hand in the recent market.\nThe summer months are also typically the busiest times of year for the city\u2019s rental market, and the attention around the adoption of the FARE Act may have spurred even more activity than usual, according to\na report\nfrom Openigloo based on a survey of its users. The rate of lease renewals between June and August fell from 69 percent in 2024 to 59 percent in 2025.\n\u201cI think the FARE Act had a part to play,\u201d said Allia Mohamed, Openigloo\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cRenters felt empowered and had more flexibility to enter the rental market.\u201d\n\nDespite higher rents, Openigloo\u2019s report found that tenants still saved money without the cost of the broker fee \u2014 about $1,300 per unit annually.\nREBNY sought to halt the FARE Act from taking effect ahead of its implementation day, though federal judges have repeatedly denied the trade group\u2019s request, including the\nlatest decision\nhanded down by an appeals court judge last month. REBNY is suing the city over the law.\nStill, brokers dealing in rentals are contending with the fallout while the law stays in place.\n\u201cOwners are getting squeezed, and brokers are working harder for their money,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht. \u201cIt\u2019s competitive.\u201d\nThe policy has pushed landlords to negotiate with brokers, Hecht added, many of whom will agree to collect a smaller fee from property owners with large portfolios. The norm used to be about a month of rent, but now some agents are taking less than that, though how much less varies and, in part, coincides with the cost of the apartment.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tough, and you say, \u2018I\u2019m only going to work for a month or nothing,\u2019 you could lose a big account,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go down the block and hire someone else.\u201d\nThe key to survival is pulling on existing relationships with landlords, who already trust in the value of their agents\u2019 services, Hecht said. However, winning new business has been a tougher sell.\n\u201cIt makes the pitch harder,\u201d Hecht said.\nCompass broker James Finelli said the FARE Act will hit new agents harder, who lack proven track records with property owners.\n\u201cPeople who have established businesses, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be severely impacted,\u201d said Finelli. \u201cIf [landlords] are going to elect to pay a fee, they\u2019re going to be more scrupulous on the person.\u201d\nBoth Finelli and Hecht agreed that those likely to absorb most of the law\u2019s impact are tenants, who are seeing asking rents go up even higher and who are having a tougher time finding available apartments. To access that inventory, some are hiring brokers and agreeing to pay a fee on top of paying an elevated asking rent.\nThe Agency\u2019s Evan Roth added that, at some point, something\u2019s gotta give.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker kind of situation. Just how much can these renters take,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s more of a shift back to the sales market.\u201d\n",

EDI requires 100 percent affordable housing.\nThe infill site, at 7040-46 Baird Avenue, is a 16,000-square-foot parcel near the corner of Reseda and Baird avenues. There are currently four small cottages on it, all built in the 1930s, according to the county assessor. Two of the homes have one bedroom and one bathroom and clock in at 576 square feet a piece. Two cottages comprise two bedrooms and one bathroom and each span 804 square feet.\n\nMeirson bought 7040-46 Baird Avenue in July for $875,000, according to the deed. He seeks regulatory relief and development bonuses from the city in exchange for including affordable housing units.\nThe Baird Avenue proposal now on file fits the same pattern as Meirson\u2019s two nearby projects, at 15931 West Victory Boulevard and 7112 North Baird Avenue, per city planning documents.\nThe former calls for demolishing five rental units and replacing it with a six-story building with 100 units that will be 100 percent affordable. The structure would span 68,000 square feet, JZA\u2019s website indicates.\nThe latter is slated to be a six-story, 34-unit building. Meirson is working with JZA on both of those applications.\nJeff Zbikowski, founder of JZA,\nnoted\nin early 2024 that a lot of the ED1 projects he was aware of were in South L.A., but ones were starting to \u201cpop up in nicer areas on the Westside or in the Valley and Reseda, some of these higher-resource areas, where they\u2019re more centered around hedging against nicer areas \u2014 providing mixed-income projects within those areas that are always going to be occupied.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In order to cover retirement checks as the city waits for property tax revenue to replenish its dwindling coffers, Chicago will lend cash to its pensions, avoiding asset sales.\nThe delayed collection stems from a computer issue.\nThe city advanced $28 million this month to the Firemen\u2019s Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund so it wouldn\u2019t need to dump stocks, bonds or other assets to cover retiree benefits, according to city finance officials. City of Chicago CFO Jill Jaworski told aldermen the city is monitoring the cash needs of all four pension funds \u2014 covering firefighters, police, laborers and municipal workers \u2014 and will lend as needed until Cook County\u2019s property tax mess is resolved, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe issue stems from a\nbungled\ncomputer system overhaul at the county, which pushed back the second installment of property tax bills by weeks. Normally, about 55 percent of Chicago\u2019s $1.77 billion levy comes in during March, with the rest arriving in August. Roughly 80 percent of that levy flows directly into pensions, meaning delays hit the funds hard.\nThe computer system overhaul \u2014 work that was contracted to Texas-based Tyler Technologies \u2014 has amounted to years of missed deadlines on the project, meaning property tax bills had still not been mailed out for payments that should have come due June 30. Property owners have a month to pay once those bills are received, potentially meaning actual revenue won\u2019t fill county coffers until the end of October.\nCity Clerk Anna Valencia, who sits on the firefighter pension board, said that she\u2019s glad the city acted to avoid selling off assets, but she also pressed the county to spell out how and when it will fix the billing problem.\n\nChicago Public Schools is also\nsuffering\nfrom the delay, racking up penalties on late payments to its teachers\u2019 fund. By the end of last month, that delay already piled almost $2.5 million in interest owed on the school district\u2019s $247 million pension fund payment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time City Hall has played banker for its pensions. In late 2023, the city advanced about $425 million in similar stopgap loans, and in 2022, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot pushed more than $500 million forward when federal aid left the budget flush. That cushion is gone now. Mayor Brandon Johnson is\nstaring\ndown a $1.15 billion city budget deficit, dwindling reserves and growing pension costs as federal relief money dries up.\nThe firefighter fund illustrates the stakes. As of year-end 2023, it carried nearly $7.5 billion in long-term liabilities but just $1.8 billion in assets, a funded ratio of 23.7 percent. That\u2019s far below the national average of about 78 percent for large public pensions. Recent benefit hikes may push it lower still.\nThe city\u2019s loans\nbuy\ntime for now. But with Johnson\u2019s proposed $300 million property tax hike dead on arrival last year, and a state mandate to get pensions to 90 percent funded by 2055, the bills are only getting harder to juggle.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group was hit with a lawsuit over its stalled 251-unit apartment project in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nMore than 40 investors in OKO\u2019s planned 34-story One River tower say that the developer has failed to advance any \u201cmeaningful construction\u201d and is yet to secure a general contractor, three-plus years after obtaining a nearly $100 million construction loan to build the tower, according to the complaint.\nThe investors sued OKO Group, as well as FPR Investor, the entity in which investors purchased a membership interest, and FPR US 1, the sponsor manager of FPR Investor. London-based Cain International is a co-developer of One River, but wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\nThe lawsuit, filed last month in Broward County Circuit Court, lists fraud and breach of contract counts.\nStarting in 2021, each investor put in $25,000 to $400,000 in the project by purchasing securities in FPR Investor, which targeted a $21 million minimum raise, according to the complaint. The investments were to be held in an escrow account with FPR US 1.\n\u201cFPR has been nothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d investors allege in the suit, adding that their capital hasn\u2019t been returned to them.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit,\u201d and said it intends \u201cto defend vigorously against them in court.\u201d\nCain did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn 2022, OKO Group and Cain, led by Jonathan Goldstein, scored a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan for One River at 629 Southeast Fifth Avenue. Bank OZK was the senior lender and JVP Management provided the mezzanine debt.\n\nConstruction was expected to start in the summer of 2022, and be completed last September, according to an OKO news release announcing the financing in 2022.\nRecords show that the development entity took out two notices of commencement of work in 2022 on the site, one for excavation and one for piling. No other commencement notices were recorded.\nOKO Group had bought the site as part of its\n$63 million\npurchase of a larger 6.7-acre assemblage south of the New River in downtown Fort Lauderdale in 2020. One River was marketed as the first tower in a multi-phase development.\nAccording to the suit, some of the investors financially backed One River through\nCrowdStreet\n. The New York-based crowdfunding platform faced heavy criticism after real estate investor Elie Schwartz pleaded guilty this year to wire fraud tied to diverting nearly $63 million of investor funds meant for Atlanta and Miami Beach offices for his personal use.\nFor more than three years, OKO Group has given regular updates on One River, according to the lawsuit. Its first quarter report showed the firm is continuing the same work that it reported in past updates, the lawsuit says. This includes putting forth general contractor bids for price feedback, and continuing talks with general contractors and construction management firms over the site and pricing. Yet, OKO still hasn\u2019t secured an \u201cactionable\u201d guaranteed maximum price from a general contractor, according to the complaint and the first quarter report.\nOKO and Cain have partnered on other projects across South Florida. The pair completed the fully leased 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year. The building attracted many new-to-market companies that moved to South Florida in the past half decade.\nIn Palm Beach, OKO and Cain propose an\nAman-branded\ncondo complex with three five-story buildings. The project will replace the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard and Edgewater at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nThe lawsuit comes as South Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared with the boom of recent years. The influx of out-of-staters had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and rent growth, and developers seized on the bonanza by quickly building new projects.\nMore recently, the construction frenzy has led to an apartment supply overhang, resulting in slower lease-ups and rent growth. Asking rents are either flat or declining across South Florida submarkets. For the past year, developers have been\ncanceling or pausing\ntheir multifamily projects amid elevated interest rates and higher construction costs.\n",

        "content": "After more than two years of vying for public support for its casino proposal, SL Green Realty is officially out of the running.\nCommunity Advisory Committees on Wednesday voted 4-2 to disapprove SL Green Realty\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday asked if he could speak, but was told that the commission was not hearing public comment. Once the meeting was over, he stood up and chastised the committee members, aside from those appointed by the mayor and governor, who were the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met the standard, and then some.\u201d\nHe then quickly exited the meeting.\nThe no votes mean two Manhattan proposals remain. A CAC vote on Silverstein Properties\u2019 proposal is slated for later Wednesday.\n\nThe other Manhattan bid is Soloviev Group and Mohegan\u2019s $11 billion Freedom Plaza on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. The CAC tasked with reviewing that project is slated to vote on the proposal on Sept. 22. Five other bids also await CAC votes, which will determine if\nthe projects\nhead to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which will award three casino licenses. The board is expected to do so by the end of the year.\nSL Green, which teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, proposed converting its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway into a casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nThe team also committed to $250 million in community investments, as well as allowing investors with as little as $500 to acquire equity in the project.\nSL Green\u2019s odds were lowered by the casino approval process itself. Members of the CAC were appointed by elected officials, including Sen. Liz Krueger, who made\nclear\nthat she did not support a casino in Manhattan. The project also faced fierce opposition from the Broadway League, an influential trade group that represents the city\u2019s theater industry, which argued that a casino would siphon from rather than complement Times Square businesses and entertainment venues.\nThe CACs that reviewed the remaining proposals must vote on their respective projects by Sept. 30.\nAhead of this key vote, some teams have continued to add perks to their proposals in an effort to make their projects more competitive. At its second public hearing, Soloviev increased the number of affordable housing units it will build from 513 to 600.\n",

CBRE\u2019s Michael Geoghegan, Ramneek Rikhy and Eric Thomas represented the tenant.\nHitting full occupancy represents a significant turnaround for a property mired in controversy less than a decade ago.\n\nBrookfield purchased the 99-year ground lease from Kushner Companies\nin a $1.3 billion deal in 2018\n, raising questions about whether\nJared Kushner leveraged foreign policy connections\nto secure a bailout of the property; the Qatari government holds investments with Brookfield.\nBrookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 39-story, 1.25 million-square-foot property, putting on a new facade reclad with glass panels, along with an upgraded lobby, amenity space, elevators and improved infrastructure to significantly reduce the carbon footprint.\nIn May 2022, Australian financial services company Macquarie Group became the first tenant to sign on at the revamped property,\ntaking 250,000 square feet\n.

Jill Eber with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal.\nThe sale marked\na price record for the neighborhood,\ntrumping\nBarstool Sports founder David Portnoy\u2019s\nprevious $14 million purchase as Morningside\u2019s most expensive home.\nSimkins is the son of the late Leon Simkins, the longtime president of their family\u2019s paper products giant Simkins Industries. The firm was known for pioneering the production of paperboard products. David Simkins\u2019 brother, Michael Simkins, heads Lion Development Group, is CEO of E11even Crypto and an owner of E11even Partners, which owns the nightclub, hotel and vodka brands of the same name. His projects in Miami include the 449-unit\nE11even Club Hotel &amp; Residences\nand 550-unit\nE11even Club Residences Beyond\n.\n\nEarlier this month, David Simkins sold his waterfront North Bay Village home for\n$13.5 million\n. He bought the 3,700-square-foot house for $3.1 million in 2016, according to property records.\nHis new Morningside pad, dubbed \u201cWhispering Pines,\u201d spans 0.9 acres, property records show. It was built in 1969, and the 3,900-square-foot home has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, the listing shows. The estate also has a 140-year-old gazebo, a treehouse, a music studio, pool, dock and 125 feet of waterfront.\nWallack listed it for $20.9 million in May, according to Zillow.\nPrice growth has been near-universal in South Florida since the pandemic triggered a luxury market boom five years ago. The degree differs from neighborhood to neighborhood, though. Morningside\u2019s neighbor Bay Point saw\na record $85 million\nsale for a waterfront estate earlier this year.",

Units will range from one to three bedrooms, with prices from $1.8 million to $10 million, the release shows.\nLefferts founder, Mendy Chudaitov, tapped Italian architect Piero Lissoni to design the tower. Amenities in the building will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, lounge, padel court, kids\u2019 room, and private beach club access through a partnership with the\nBoucher Brothers\n.\nMiami Beach-based Lefferts acquired the non-waterfront assemblage for a combined $14.3 million over two decades, records show.\nThe launch follows the completion of Lefferts\u2019 first North Beach condo project,\n72 Park\n, earlier this year. Closings for the 22-story, 206-unit short-term rental-friendly tower at 580 72nd Street \u2013\u2013 which is adjacent to the 72 Carlyle site \u2013\u2013 started in March. Lefferts also launched sales for its planned\nPalma Miami Beach Residences\nat 600 71st Street last year, with condo prices starting at $650,000. Cervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing for the project, which is 40 percent presold, Chudaitov confirmed.\n\nChudaitov said his target demographics for 72 Carlyle are locals, out-of-state buyers from feeder markets like California and New York, and investors.\u00a0 The project is intended to provide \u201cobtainable luxury\u201d for buyers interested in proximity to the beach (which is five blocks away), he said, \u201cThe price point is really the sweet spot in this market.\u201d\nElliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund said he also anticipates the project appealing to location-focused locals, rather than international buyers who are more drawn to branded residences and supertalls. Eklund says North Beach is in the early stages of a luxury evolution.\n\u201cThis is like NoHo 10 years ago I would say,\u201d he said, referencing the once-overlooked Manhattan neighborhood.\nIn 2017, Miami Beach residents voted to increase density for developments in North Beach, setting the stage for a new wave of investment in the neighborhood. Lefferts\u2019 completion of 72 Park marked the first new condominium in\nNorth Beach\nin five years.\nAside from Lefferts\u2019 projects, the rezoning spurred developments like Northlink Capital\u2019s planned\n7200 Collins\n. The 12-story, 222-unit project is slated for 7200 Collins Avenue, on the former site of Denny\u2019s. Sales launched for the non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condos in April, with prices starting at $600,000. In March, Constellation Group, Boschetti Group and Vietmar landed a $42.3 million construction loan for their planned\nElla Miami Beach\n. The 10-story, 103-unit non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condo project at 6940 Abbott Avenue has prices starting at $500,000.\nOther projects in North Beach\u2019s pipeline include the Meruelo family and Terra\u2019s planned 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project at the 3.8-acre oceanfront\nDeauville Beach Resort\nat 6701 Collins Avenue. Witkoff Group has also joined Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher on their stalled\nOcean Terrace\nproject on the site spanning 7409 to 7449 Collins Avenue and 7400 to 7450 Ocean Terrace, which includes a 20-story, 75-unit luxury condo.",

The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.

The team indicated that because they were not given adequate time to consider the request, the vote should be postponed. A spokesperson for the team said the late request \u201ctaints the CAC process.\u201d Angel Vasquez, who was appointed to the CAC by Gov.

        "content": "The former Vornado leasing executive accused of stealing more than $9 million from the firm allegedly created fake brokerages and burner accounts to bill the REIT for phony services over a 15-year period, according to federal prosecutors.\nJared Solomon\nwas arrested in December and charged by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with stealing $9.5 million from his employer. The feds do not identify the company, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it is Vornado Realty Trust.\nAccording to the prosecutors, Solomon defrauded the company by creating fake brokerage companies named Margoux Media and Cobalt Advisors, and then submitting invoices to Vornado for work he claimed the companies had performed.\n\u201cThe defendant carried out his fraud scheme by using fake commercial real estate agreements \u2014 mainly fake broker agreements, among other types of agreements \u2014 and fake invoices that called for Victim Company-1 to issue checks and wire payments to one of three purported real estate broker companies,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.\nThe third company is an actual brokerage, though prosecutors said the firm had no knowledge that Solomon was submitting invoices in its name.\nOn several fake agreements, Solomon allegedly copied and pasted a signature he had access to from an executive who did a bona fide licensing agreement with Vornado in 2015, and then claimed the executive was the chief financial officer of the fictitious Margoux Media.\n\nSolomon allegedly used fake email addresses and burner phone numbers to communicate with higher-ups at Vornado who had concerns about the payments. After the company made a $1.4 million payment to the Margoux account in 2019, Solomon allegedly used the money to buy a pricey Manhattan home.\n\u201cOnly one week later, the defendant, in turn, wired that amount, plus nearly $1 million in additional fraud proceeds that the defendant had previously obtained from Victim Company-1, to a real estate attorney to finance part of the purchase of a $4 million apartment located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nSolomon and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Southern District attorney\u2019s office revealed the new details earlier this month when responding to Solomon\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the charges\n. The prosecutors refuted his argument that the indictment was overly vague, stating that it met the required standard.\nProsecutors earlier this year told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle for Solomon to change his not guilty plea. But since then, the defendant has changed attorneys and no formal agreement has been reached.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "In the 1990s, fashion designers descended twice per year on Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park to preview their upcoming collections to buyers and reporters in tents.\nIn the years since, New York Fashion Week has grown into an extensive public spectacle, staged against backdrops across the city with designers looking far and wide for backdrops to accentuate their seasonal visions.\nAlthough a runway show is often just a one-day affair, industry experts say the glitz and glamour of these events can bring visibility and cultural cache to a venue.\nThat\u2019s been the case for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, according to Joyce Duverce, senior vice president of impact and partnerships at the yard\u2019s development corporation.\nThe Navy Yard, which is 300 acres of industrial space, has hosted two fashion shows. In 2023, Bronx native Ralph Lauren turned a warehouse in the yard into a barn-style runway show, followed by a seated dinner under chandeliers (in attendance: JLo, Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern, and Julianne Moore). In 2024, although not part of fashion week, Victoria\u2019s Secret hosted its runway show at the Yard\u2019s Duggal Greenhouse.\n\u201cIt brings the audience,\u201d Duverce said. \u201cWe have over 550 businesses here, but I don\u2019t think most people know that we have the capacity to host such large events.\u201d\nBeyond any promotion, big events have also helped bring business to the yard\u2019s tenants, including fabricators and lighting vendors, according to Duverce.\nAnd if a space is particularly noteworthy, an event can potentially lead to long-term leasing opportunities for a venue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had people reach out to us directly after showing in a beautiful new space or a commercial building saying, \u2018Do you have the real estate agent to contact? Are they renting space in the building? Is there retail space available?\u2019\u201d said Robert Kalas, an executive producer at La Mode En Images, a production company.\nThe right fit\nNot every space can draw in fashion week clients for a runway show. First, there are basic conditions to be met.\n\u201cDesigners are always looking for a large space that\u2019s column-free, that no one has ever done a fashion show in before, that\u2019s located in Manhattan, that\u2019s ground floor with 800 amps, three-phase power,\u201d Kalas said.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a drive for anything iconic to New York, anything industrial, and anything with views of the city. Some of the more offbeat fashion week venues have included the New York Public Library, the city\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court, and the NBA Player\u2019s Association practice facility.\nEvents have certainly shifted from just 34th Street, but still cluster in a handful of Manhattan neighborhoods \u2014 Soho, Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, the West Village and Tribeca \u2014 with an occasional foray out to Brooklyn. That\u2019s in part because shows are timed so closely together, leaving busy attendees with little time to travel.\n\nMoney to be made\nSome venues, like the Altman Building in Chelsea or 28 Liberty in the Financial District, run a year-round events business.\nFor those properties, fashion week brings significant exposure, letting patrons see the venue often in a new light. But the direct monetary impact of any single event may be limited. The Altman Building, where Sandy Liang and Private Policy have debuted their new work, charges a fixed rate for events, meaning no markup for fashion clients.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a celebration of life or a gala dinner, it really is the same price to host an event with us,\u201d said Ariel Swain, director of venue sales and marketing at the Altman Building. \u201cAny opportunity to showcase the space in a different light is an opportunity for us to have other events with the people who are in attendance.\u201d\nBut a business in short-term events can provide visibility and limit risk in an unpredictable real estate landscape, said Sara Altobelli, who runs marketing for Hush Venues.\nHush manages events at 28 Liberty\u2019s Halo space, where Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang have both had models walk the runway, circling the venue\u2019s 1964 Noguchi sculpture garden. Hush partners exclusively with venues and then runs all the events in a space.\n\u201cFashion Week gets a lot of press and attention,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cFrom a cultural aspect, it\u2019s an incredible angle to be part of this very New York thing that is Fashion Week.\u201d\nIf done right, the result can also be profitable. Karrie Goldberg, founder and CEO at The Kagency, partners directly with property owners and developers to score a calendar of shorter-term events, including runway shows. For the right venue, such a business can net up to three times the profits of a traditional retail lease, she said.\n\u201cIf you look at a 10,000-square-foot space that is fully finished \u2014 as in, it could be a raw space but you have all the base amenities \u2014 you could be paying anywhere from\n20 to 25 grand\nfor the day,\u201d she said.\nSome developers, Goldberg said, are happy to run that business year-round. But others use her agency to monetize time between more traditional tenants, giving access to their space for just 90 days.\nThough fashion houses occasionally reach out directly, much of the business is through public relations or production companies. The Kagency manages bookings for more than 500 venues across multiple cities and has run shows with multiple fashion clients, including Proenza Schouler at the Chelsea Factory, and Ulla Johnson at Powerhouse Arts, a former power plant in Gowanus.\nAlthough the marketing potential from a runway show can last, the show itself is fleeting.\n\u201cThe show is 15 minutes and then everything gets taken down,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cIt all happens in a New York minute, and then it all goes away.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is considering dumping the remaining units at his Mandarin Oriental Residences.\nShvo and the other investors behind the project at 685 Fifth Avenue, which includes Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, hired Eastdil Secured to find a buyer for the unsold condos in a bulk deal, sources familiar with the matter told\nBloomberg\n.\nA bulk sale would end the developers\u2019\nfour-year struggle\nto offload condos at the Midtown property, where fewer than one-third of its 65 units have traded so far. The developers tapped Douglas Elliman to head sales at the project, though listings for the remaining sponsor units are no longer available on Streeteasy.\nNews of the plans for a bulk deal comes about a year after the developers scored a\n$120 million\ninventory loan from the Northwind Group. At the time, only 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million.\nA spokesperson for Shvo confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the investor group was mulling over a potential sale, following a\nsimilar strategy\nit employed at the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills. Last year, the partnership sold 44 sponsor units at the project to Centurion Real Estate Partners after defaulting on a $200 million loan.\nIn a statement, Shvo\u2019s spokesperson pointed to the partnership\u2019s shift from focusing on residential development to office projects. \u201cWe are continuing to execute on that strategy with the potential bulk sale of remaining units at 685 5th Avenue,\u201d the spokesperson said. Shvo, however,\nrecently sold\none of his planned mixed-use projects on Alton Road in Miami Beach to Infinity. The spokesperson added that the firm has invested $250 million in its office portfolio.\n\nSpokespeople for Eastdil and BVK declined Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment. A spokesperson for Deutsche Finance America did not immediately respond to the outlet\u2019s request.\nShvo and his partners bought 685 Fifth, formerly known as the Gucci building, for $135 million in 2018, three years after Shvo\u2019s first bid to buy the building fell through. The developers converted the office portion of the building into condos and added five floors of residences.\nSince sales of the fully-furnished units launched in December 2021, some units have traded for steep discounts, including a 3,400-square-foot apartment that sold last October for\n$17 million\n\u2014 significantly less than its last asking price of $22 million.\nBuyers at the Mandarin Oriental sued the development group and Shvo last year over allegations that construction on their $6 million one-bedroom condo did not line up with agreed-upon plans. A New York judge\ndismissed Shvo\nas an individual defendant in the suit, though the case is still pending.\nShvo has also been locked in a legal battle with the Core Club, a tenant at his 711 Fifth Avenue office building. The developer is in the\nprocess of evicting\nthe private members club, which sued him last year for $600 million. Last month, a New York judge ruled that the Core Club\nowed Shvo\n$1 million for defaulting on a loan.\n\u2014\nSheridan Wall\n",

According to the\nNew York Times\n, Lutnick pushed for a management shakeup two years ago, which led the board to ultimately hire Lutnick\u2019s own firm, Newmark, to advise on upgrades.\nThat pivot has spiraled into late-stage talks to sell the entire property at 795 Fifth Avenue for\nroughly $2 billion\n. The prospective deal would involve funding from the Khashoggi family and management by the Dorchester Collection, owned by the sultan of Brunei.\nIf approved, the sale could force out famous residents, including former Disney chief Michael Eisner, designer Tory Burch and media heiress Shari Redstone. Older owners in their 80s and 90s are furious, arguing they\u2019ve poured fortunes into renovations only to face eviction.\n\u201cTo find new accommodations and go through the trauma\u2026 would seriously affect my health, well-being and finances,\u201d longtime resident Tina Beriro, 84, wrote in an email obtained by the Times.\n\nLutnick, who hasn\u2019t lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, is distancing himself. A spokesperson for his department said he hasn\u2019t been involved in discussions for months and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away when Trump tapped him for his administration post.\nStill, the perception lingers that Newmark \u2014 poised to reap tens of millions in fees \u2014 set the deal in motion with Lutnick\u2019s blessing.\nThe outcome rests with the co-op\u2019s shareholders. Any sale requires approval from two-thirds of its shares, meaning Lutnick\u2019s oversized stake could prove decisive.\nSupporters frame the choice as cashing out at a profitable value versus footing astronomical assessments for long-delayed repairs. Opponents fear the loss of their homes to foreign owners with controversial ties.\nThe building\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled this week in the Pierre\u2019s Cotillion ballroom, where tempers will likely be raw. For a building long synonymous with luxury, the fight may determine whether its next chapter is one of restoration or exile.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Ian Bruce Eichner unloaded a Crown Heights\ndevelopment site\nat the center of a fierce zoning fight over shadows on the nearby Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nIsaac Schwartz snapped up 970 Franklin Avenue for $54.3 million from Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company, according to a press release from JLL. The site is approved for a 10-story building with 355 units, of which 106 must be income-restricted.\nJLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton, Brendan Maddigan and Michael Mazzara arranged the sale.\nThe deal closes a tumultuous chapter for Continuum, which spent six years trying to push through rezonings that would have allowed larger multifamily projects on the site. The City Planning Commission scaled back Eichner\u2019s proposal to reduce shadows on the Garden.\nIn exchange for lower building heights, Council member Crystal Hudson let Continuum use the \u201cworkforce housing\u201d option in the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which allowed for higher rents. Continuum also reduced the project\u2019s slope from its initial proposal, allowing more sunlight to reach the Garden\u2019s plant nursery and other areas. The Council approved the rezoning in November.\n\nThe road to consensus was long and rough. Eichner bought the site in 2017 for $33 million and had sought to build two 39-story towers with more than 1,500 apartments on a site that also included 960 Franklin Avenue. Roughly half of the units would have been set aside as affordable.\nThat bid never made it far, largely because of opposition from the Garden. The 960 Franklin site was then\nsold for $43 million\nin 2022 to Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler, who in turn\nsold it to another developer\n, Yitzchok Schwartz, for\n$64 million\n. Schwartz plans 300 condo units across seven stories and 240,000 square feet, which he can build without political approval. (It\u2019s unclear whether Isaac Schwartz, who bought the adjacent 970 Franklin, is the same as this Yitzchok Shwartz, given Yitzchok is the Hebrew version of the name Isaac.)\nEichner pushed ahead with his remaining portion of the site and filed a new application to rezone it. The City Planning Commission shortened the towers to reduce the shadow impact to roughly half an hour per day, only to have Eichner deem that financially infeasible and\nthreaten to withdraw the application\n.\nBut he didn\u2019t, and now Schwartz will decide whether to proceed with Eichner\u2019s project. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA lawyer for Continuum declined to comment. Eichner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Chikoo Patel is drowning in debt.\nAmerican Express is the latest among a slew of lenders going after the embattled Chicago landlord in Cook County court, citing an unpaid credit card balance of over $63,000 following a missed minimum payment earlier this summer, according to a lawsuit filed last week.\nIt\u2019s a small dollar figure compared to the scale of his real estate collapse, which so far includes about $20 million in alleged debts or broken contracts across Illinois. But the new lawsuit shows how deep of a financial hole Patel has dug along his journey from up-and-coming investor to embattled defendant.\nPatel\u2019s profile was rising for years as a landlord and large-scale property manager in Chicago\u2019s South Side apartment market. Through his company,\nCKO Real Estate\n, he acquired and took on management for dozens of rental buildings in neighborhoods like South Shore. He brought in outside investors to help bankroll acquisitions, promising steady returns, while positioning himself as a key player in affordable housing. For a while, the strategy worked, until tenants, and then lenders, began to see the cracks.\nNow, at least one of Patel\u2019s frequent investment partners,\nShai Wolkowicki\n, is distancing himself from the financial turmoil.\n\u201cWe have not been associated with Chikoo Patel or CKO Real Estate since the beginning of February, when we parted ways. We have had new management in place since that time,\u201d Wolkowicki said in an email. He didn\u2019t provide an interview or respond to follow-up questions about the path to recovery for his investments or the size of his and CKO\u2019s real estate portfolio.\nPatel didn\u2019t return multiple requests for an interview.\nBuildings under CKO\u2019s control deteriorated, and financial woes followed. Wolkowicki has been named a defendant along with Patel in a $16 million lawsuit brought by Old National Bank over a Springfield multifamily deal that has sunk into distress. Wolkowicki also took over decision-making authority from Patel for Rockford properties as they were sold off earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the transactions.\n\nAt CKO\u2019s Chicago buildings, maintenance requests went unanswered. Mold, pests, broken heating systems and unsafe stairwells became common complaints. This spring, tenants organized and took their fight public. South Shore renters pleaded with city officials to be released from their leases, saying they felt scammed out of rent and deposits while Patel\u2019s team ignored basic repairs. One resident\ntold\nBlock Club that living in a CKO building felt like being \u201ctrapped,\u201d with no way out short of legal intervention.\nThe city eventually stepped in. In April, Chicago officials sued the owners of a South Shore courtyard building formerly managed by CKO, citing hazardous, slum-like conditions that posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to tenants. The city sought a court-appointed receiver to take over management and make repairs at 6952-58 South Paxton Avenue, where residents had gone without heat and hot water after CKO shuttered operations. Patel was summoned to court alongside the property owners and lenders, though he\ntold\nthe Triibe he hadn\u2019t been associated with the buildings for \u201csome months.\u201d\nAs property conditions worsened, Patel\u2019s financial troubles multiplied. Lender Itria Ventures, which provides small-businesses capital in exchange for pledging their future revenues toward repayment, sued CKO and Patel earlier this year seeking over $115,000 in alleged debt that fell into default, according to documents obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. CKO and its affiliates borrowed $150,000 a year ago in exchange for pledging to repay $192,000, but began missing payments by February, public records show.\nItria dismissed its lawsuit but appears to have plans to re-file it; an attorney for securitized mortgage lenders appeared in the case on behalf of entities that own property set to be seized from borrowers with ties to Patel. The loans on those properties, at 541 East 80th and 8100 South May streets in Chicago, totaled over $1 million and were originated by locally based lender\nRenovo Financial\n.\nThe revelations painted a picture of a multifamily operator stretched thin, using other people\u2019s money to chase scale without the capacity to deliver.\nBy late summer, some of Patel\u2019s investors and lenders joined the revolt. Last month\nThe Real Deal\nreported that unpaid debts and broken promises soured once-supportive financial backers. Some had put significant capital into Patel\u2019s ventures expecting reliable returns; instead, they ended up damaging a relationship with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and got left holding buildings that were bleeding cash, with tenants unwilling to pay rent under unlivable conditions.\nWhether buyers step in with the capital and competence to stabilize the properties remains an open question. For lenders and investors, the cautionary tale is clear: chasing yield through lightly capitalized operators can backfire spectacularly.\n",

        "content": "A builder in Hinsdale will forge ahead with plans to demolish a 19th-century house over the objection of the village\u2019s Board of Trustees after the board voted this week to reject his demolition and construction application.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of\nhistoric preservation running up against the demands\nof luxury buyers in the high-end Chicago suburb, where preservationists have worked to keep historic and architecturally unique homes intact.\nThe house at 142 East First Street is alternatively called \u201cThe Hallmark House,\u201d because it was featured in Hallmark commercials in the 1970s, and the William Whitney House. It was built in 1869 and owned by William H. Whitney, an Illinois state representative who was responsible for Hinsdale\u2019s incorporation as a village in 1873.\nThe seven-member village board voted unanimously to deny the application to demolish the house and construct a new one on Tuesday. Hinsdale\u2019s historic preservation rules require homeowners to seek approval before tearing down or altering buildings in historic districts, but unless the property is designated as a landmark, its decisions are nonbinding. So the owner can continue with the development as long as it meets existing zoning rules.\nHinsdale\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission also unanimously rejected the application in an August meeting.\nRobert Cimala, president of Legacy Homes Cimala, which bought the property this year for $2.2 million, is planning a spec build on the site, intending to sell a new house in the $7 million range. The house was previously owned by the Grace Episcopal Church next door.\nCimala said he will continue with the demolition and construction plan, calling the Historic Preservation Commission\u2019s requests for remodeling the house unrealistic and criticizing the process required to begin construction.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way this is set up, all that they can do is advise.\u201d\nThe home planned for the lot will be 6,840 square-feet, while the existing house is less than 4,000 square-feet. The planned house will have a four-car garage and rise four-and-a-half feet higher than the existing structure.\n\nCimala said demolition will begin sometime in the next few weeks and he expects construction to be finished next fall.\nCimala said he looked into remodeling the house when he first inspected it, and an architect told him it was not feasible. To renovate the house would require essentially tearing it down and rebuilding it, and the cost to renovate was unreasonable, he said. Members of a design review team in April suggested including the house\u2019s Italianate architecture in the design of the new house, but Cimala said there wasn\u2019t a market for that style.\n\u201cWhat they wanted me to do was basically tear down the house and build another one exactly like it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I told them I wasn\u2019t going to do that. That\u2019s not the style of home people want nowadays.\u201d\nBruce George, an architect with Charles Vincent George Architects, who is designing the new home, detailed the house\u2019s structural problems during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He said he was involved in a remodeling of the house in 2005 through the church\u2019s maintenance committee. The church put $500,000 of work into the house, but he said a lot of things were left in poor shape because of the cost.\nThe house is part of the Robbins Park Historic District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nFearing the loss of historic properties, Hinsdale created a\nHistoric Overlay District in 2022\nthat gave tax incentives to owners of historically significant homes who improved them while preserving traditional architecture instead of demolishing them.\nThe program has seen success, with about 100 homeowners applying for tax incentives to renovate their historic homes, Hinsdale Trustee Alexis Braden said. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Mimi Collins\nbought and renovated a historic house\non South Park Avenue that she sold for $6 million last year.\nIn the North Shore\u2019s Glencoe, another luxury market with a history of teardowns, city officials are considering\nsimilar incentives to preserve historic buildings\n.\nSome preservation activists want Hinsdale to have more power to block demolitions of historic places, though. Landmark Illinois urged the village trustees to give the application process teeth and make it binding, in a letter read into the record on Tuesday by Trustee Luke Stifflear.\n\u201cHinsdale has seen an increase in approved demolitions over the past several years, endangering the character of the Robbins Park National Registered Historic District,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe Historic Preservation Commission of Hinsdale urgently needs to revisit the village regulations to make it more difficult for historic assets to be demolished.\u201d",

        "content": "Paramount Group, the office landlord and real estate investment trust that has become synonymous with San Francisco, is coming under new ownership.\nNew York City-based Rithm Capital won a bidding war for Paramount Group, beating out interested parties including investment firm Blackstone and\noffice owners SL Green Realty\nand Vornado Realty Trust, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Rithm was founded under Fortress Investment Group in 2013.\nRithm bought Paramount for $1.6 billion,\naccording\nto the outlet. As of yesterday, Paramount had a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. Green Street analysts predict the deal could be about $2 billion.\nNew York-based\nParamount\nput San Francisco at the heart of its premium office portfolio two decades ago. But as the pandemic wrecked the office market in San Francisco, Paramount has struggled to maintain ownership of several properties.\nAt its peak before the pandemic, Paramount owned six properties in San Francisco spanning more than 4.3 million square feet,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Standard. Paramount owns more than a dozen office towers in New York and San Francisco, including One Market Plaza, One Front Street, and 300 Mission Street.\nMonths before the sale, Paramount had been working to improve its finances by selling off parts of its San Francisco portfolio.\n\nParamount sold a 25 percent equity interest in the 640,000-square-foot One Front Street office building in May. That deal was completed in exchange for $40.5 million of short-term, fixed-rate financing. At the time of the sale, the building was valued at $255 million \u2014 more than half the $521 million price Paramount paid for it in 2016.\nThat same month, Paramount sold the 770,000-square-foot Market Center office building to Flynn Properties, headed by local franchise operator Greg Flynn. The firm\npurchased\nthe remainder of Paramount\u2019s debt for $177 million, marking a 76 percent discount on the purchase price.\nLast year, Paramount agreed to pay its lenders $125 million in order to push the loan maturity on One Market Plaza, the largest of Paramount\u2019s San Francisco holdings, to 2028. At One Front Street and One Market Plaza, Paramount executives were in the process of adding amenities to keep tenants in its offices and attract new ones.\nGoogle, Visa and law firm Morgan Lewis are exiting One Market Plaza. Meanwhile, Paramount\u2019s 55 Second Street building is being marketed for sale by lenders.\nParamount\u2019s remaining San Francisco portfolio was approximately 75 percent leased at the end of the second quarter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s South MoPac corridor is defying the city\u2019s otherwise sagging office market with vacancy rates less than half of those downtown.\nThe area \u2014 stretching along\nMoPac Expressway\nfrom Lady Bird Lake to Hwy 290 \u2014 posted a 13.8 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter, down from 18.1 percent three months earlier, according to Aquila Commercial. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the rate is far below the metro\u2019s average vacancy of roughly 17 percent and a sharp contrast to submarkets like East Austin, where nearly half of office space is available.\nThe pull is a mix of location, pricing and convenience, Aquila said. Rents and operating expenses are cheaper than downtown, parking is free and plentiful, and tenants can still\nreach\nthe city\u2019s core in minutes. The corridor feels like a tight micromarket, with no new construction in the pipeline, Aquila Principal Taylor McHargue told the outlet.\nThat swing is helped by displaced tenants. Last year the city bought One and Two Barton Skyway, removing nearly 400,000 square feet of office space from the market to consolidate Austin city departments. Companies like JE Dunn Construction, which will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot office at Terrace 6 next year, have pushed into the corridor\u2019s already limited 3.3 million-square-foot inventory.\n\nHPI Real Estate, which owns and occupies space at Barton Oaks Plaza II and III, has seen demand rise. Managing director Casey Casper told the outlet that companies weighing downtown often\nopt\nfor South MoPac instead, citing easier commutes for employees living south and west of the city. Executives who reside along the corridor also tilt decisions in its favor.\nThe relative affordability is another edge.\nDiscounted\nrents, lower expenses and no parking charges have made the corridor more competitive at a time when cost-conscious tenants are balking at downtown\u2019s 28 percent vacancy, McHargue said.\nThat demand is colliding with limited supply, creating one of the few Austin submarkets trending toward high occupancy. Available space totaled about 450,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter, including sublease offerings, Aquila reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
