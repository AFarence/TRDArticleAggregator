        "content": "Last week,\nRick Caruso\nsaid \u201cno\u201d to a political run. This week, the why became a bit clearer.\nAs the developer shook hands and spoke to a crowd sitting by an empty residential lot on La Fiesta Avenue in Altadena on Thursday, he uttered the word \u201cprivate\u201d four times in less than three-and-a-half minutes \u2014 as in \u201cprivate sector\u201d and \u201cprivate individuals.\u201d\nThe purpose of the gathering on the residential street was to watch a 950-square-foot, factory-built home by\nSamara\n\u2014 the modular home outfit started by Airbnb founder Joe Gebbia \u2014 being dropped by crane and installed onto the lot to replace the property burned down by last year\u2019s Eaton Fire.\n\u201cA little over a year ago, it was clear to me that we had to have private enterprise, private individuals, jump into action and help the city, the county and the state, so Steadfast was formed,\u201d Caruso told the crowd.\nThe Caruso-founded non-profit is steered by a consortium of executives hailing from real estate, technology, finance and other industries to help expedite wildfire rebuilding.\nSteadfast and Samara teamed to start a program, giving modular homes to qualified homeowners who lost their homes from the fires. After Friday\u2019s installation, eight other families are in line for Samara-built homes.\n\u201cThis is what the private sector can do,\u201d Caruso said, motioning to the work Steadfast and Samara are doing.\nWhen the developer confirmed last week that he would not run for an elected office, part of his consideration was where \u201cI can make the greatest impact.\u201d His comments this week, and the tangible result of a family standing before what will be their new home in a matter of weeks, help fill in the picture.\nMismanaged funds\nSpeaking of local government, news broke Friday that Alexander Soofer was arrested by federal prosecutors. The Westwood resident is being charged with taking $23 million in public funds earmarked for homelessness programs.\nSoofer is the CEO of Abundant Blessings, a nonprofit that holds contracts with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an agency jointly funded by the county and city to coordinate social services and housing.\nThe federal criminal complaint alleges Soofer funneled some of the money toward a $7 million Westwood home, a $125,000 Range Rover, private school for his kids and other personal luxuries.\nLos Angeles Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez slammed LAHSA on Friday, asserting the agency \u201chas repeatedly failed to provide the basic oversight or accountability required for public resources.\u201d She called the charges against Soofer \u201cyet another example of the enormous resources that have been wasted while people remain unhoused and without help.\u201d\nGetting real on pricing\nYou might have missed the most recent\nprice cut\nfor the spec mansion called \u201cLa Fin\u201d in Bel-Air\u2014and you\u2019d be forgiven if you had. It was the fifth cut since 2022 when 1200 Bel Air Road went on the market for $139 million.\nThe latest asking price is just under $100 million, which Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman said represented a more \u201cpragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nIn other words, sellers are coming to terms with what buyers are willing to pay.\nThat opens the door to the question of whether the market sees a repeat of last year\u2019s trend of mansions closing below their original ask.\nIf the roughly 105,000-square-foot mega mansion\u2019s price cut and the thinking behind it from several of its listing agents (there\u2019s a team of seven hailing from four brokerages) is any indication, that would seem to be the case.\nCarolwood\u2019s latest play\nIn business, growth is a balancing act.\nIt\u2019s weighed against the need to generate more revenue to pay for additional talent or other resources, with factors that can\u2019t always be quantified, such as brand equity.\nCarolwood Estates\nseems to be striking the balance.\nAs the brokerage continues to grow its share of the local market, it\u2019s still found ways to expand its customer base geographically without losing its Beverly Hills boutique branding as seen with this past week\u2019s announcement of a partnership with Knight Frank.\nThe deal with the London real estate firm opens the buyer and seller pool for Carolwood. It now has the ability to market overseas to buyers looking for West Coast trophy properties or show existing clients a growing reach.\n",

        "content": "I don\u2019t usually step out from behind my byline, but it felt necessary for recapping a week when I became part of the story.\nI\u2019ve been covering the\nfinancial unraveling of Jon Venetos\u2019 Dallas-based multifamily investment firm Lurin Capital\nfor the better part of a year. When residents of Lurin\u2019s\nMadison, Alabama property the Sutton\nstarted to feel the effects of their landlord\u2019s collapse \u2014 these folks had been without water for more than a week after Lurin stopped paying utilities bills \u2014 NBC\u2019s Huntsville affiliate WAFF picked up the story.\nReporter Nick Balenger has been on the \u201cSutton Saga\u201d beat, depicting substandard living conditions at the Sutton and detailing tenants\u2019 efforts to get them fixed. In trying to get answers on their behalf, he found the same thing I did: a company refusing to publicly answer for the harm it\u2019s causing.\nBalenger reached out to chat about my reporting and asked me to contribute to a\nsegment\non the situation. We talked Tuesday, and Balenger wove our interview into a piece that includes his on-the-ground reporting from the properties. I explained that Lurin\u2019s breakdown is an example of multifamily syndicators going sideways when interest rates rose but that this story is unique for the accusations of fraud coming from lenders and former employees.\nAL.com\nand Huntsville\u2019s CBS affiliate\nWHNT\nhave also been covering the situation in Madison County. In the last week, local water provider Madison Utilities closed Lurin\u2019s account after it accumulated\n$30,000 in unpaid bills\n. The city of Madison declared the Sutton a public nuisance, which requires tenants to leave the property. The city has been working to help displaced residents, including partnering with local homelessness nonprofit ShowerUp Huntsville to provide shower and laundry services.\nLurin hit with five more foreclosures\nMeanwhile, Lurin Capital\u2019s legal challenges from lenders keep coming. In the latest spate of lawsuits,\nFannie Mac accused Lurin\nof defaulting on $59.4 million tied to five Pensacola, Florida, properties. Lurin borrowed nearly $60 million in January 2024 and stopped making payments in October 2025, Fannie Mae claims.\nThe lender also accuses Lurin of neglecting the properties and allowing liens to pile up against them.\nThe government-sponsored lender\u00a0 is asking the court to foreclose on the properties and demand payment of the unpaid principal on the loans, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe suits mark the second state in which Fannie Mae has sued Lurin. It claimed in a Nov. 6 Texas District Court filing that the firm\ndefaulted on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit Houston apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive.\nMegatel\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency\nWhat do Kanye West, Barron Trump and Dallas-based homebuilder Megatel have in common? They\u2019ve all launched crypto tokens. Megatel co-founders Zach and Aaron Ipour announced the launch of\nMegPrime\nafter receiving a \u201cno-action\u201d letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company is marketing the token as a payment and rewards tool, rather than an investment. Using MegPrime on average purchases will allow token users to earn rebates, discounted gift cards and points redeemable for housing-related benefits.\nMaves narrow down site search\nDallas\u2019 NBA team dreams of playing in a new arena by 2031, meaning it has five years to develop its new home. The Mavs are planning to ditch American Airlines Center in Victory Plaza but appear to be making good on the promise to stay in the city. CEO Rick Welts told the Dallas Morning News that the team has been working with city officials and\nnarrowed down the search to two locations\n: North Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, or Downtown Dallas. A downtown site could involve the land under City Hall, but that option of course hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building.\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is bulking up again in Midtown.\nThe Extell founder is in contract to buy a prime development site at 405-415 Park Avenue, along with a chunk of air rights from nearby Central Synagogue, according to people familiar with the deal. Barnett is also in negotiations to acquire an adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, potentially stitching together what could become one of the most significant new assemblages in Midtown.\nThe Park Avenue sites are controlled by two ownership groups that have been quietly marketing the properties for either a sale or recapitalization. A joint venture between GDS Development and Swedish investor Corem Property Group AB owns\n407\u2013417 Park Avenue\n. Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm and MRP Realty bought\n405 Park Avenue\nin 2016 (it\u2019s unclear if Deutsche Bank or DWS, which was spun out from the bank in 2018, is the current partner). Meanwhile, the Parkoff Organization owns 110 East 55th Street.\nThe sale price was not disclosed, but sellers were seeking north of $500 million. The Park Avenue site, which sits between East 54th and East 55th streets, can support roughly 527,000 square feet of development as-of-right, or as much as 700,000 square feet of rentable office space with additional air rights, according to marketing materials. That does not include the East 55th Street property.\nThe assemblage is steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 2.5 million-square-foot global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and near Citadel and Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s planned tower at 350 Park Avenue.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Marcella Fasulo and Adam Doneger negotiated the assemblage sale. CBRE\u2019s Steve Siegel and a Fried Frank team advised on the air rights deal.\nSpokespeople for Extell, GDS, Corem, MRP Realty, DWS and Parkoff Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nIf the deal closes, it would mark another major Midtown bet for Barnett, who has spent years amassing land and air rights along Park Avenue and in the Plaza District. While the ultimate use of the site is not known, the location and scale suggest a high-end office or mixed-use tower aimed at tenants willing to pay a premium to be near the city\u2019s newest trophy developments.\nExtell is also developing a 29-story office and retail tower at\n570 Fifth Avenue\n, between West 46th and 47th Streets. Extell filed plans for\n655 Madison Avenue\nthat include commercial and office space as part of a taller mixed-use tower, though the primary focus is residential.",

At the time, it had less than 100 creditors, between $50 million and $100 million in assets and between $50 million and $100 million in liabilities.The firm completed the bankruptcy process in March 2024, court filings show.\nThe hotel made headlines in 2016 after\n46-year-old Brian Sample\nwas found killed in a 10th-floor room at Le Meridien Dallas.\nThere\u2019s one other hotel in the Metroplex with the Le Meridien flag,\nLe Meridien Fort Worth Downtown\n, at 811 Commerce Street. Blueprint Hospitality converted a former parking garage into the 188-key hotel.\nThe Stoneleigh\n, at 2927 Maple Avenue in Uptown Dallas, is dropping the Le Meridien brand with the debut of a multimillion-dollar renovation set to be completed this spring. The property, which is owned by Brookfield, will transition to Marriott\u2019s Autograph Collection.\nApartment complexes and office properties have dominated the foreclosure auction block across the Texas Triangle in the last few years. But distress has been shifting to include more hospitality properties. In January, nearly $170 million in loans tied to hotels were flagged for foreclosure in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\n",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission voted down a proposal to allow affordable housing development on land zoned for religious institutions and other civic uses.\nCommissioner Ralph Rosado called it a \u201cwasted opportunity in what is arguably the least affordable city in the United States of America,\u201d at the Thursday meeting, the Miami Herald\nreported\n.\nRosado proposed the citywide zoning change and was its sole \u201cyes\u201d vote. The city had identified more than 660 properties spanning 1,800 acres that would have been opened up to affordable housing development under the proposed zoning change.\nThe proposal was inspired by a Florida Senate bill passed in 2025 that gives local governments the choice to allow housing development on land owned by religious institutions so long as 10 percent of the units meet affordability requirements. Rosado\u2019s proposal would have required 50 percent of the units built on Miami sites be affordable.\nThis failed effort is part of a growing \u201cYes in God\u2019s backyard\u201d or YIGBY movement to counter NIMBYism by building on church-owned land.\nReligious groups own millions of acres across the U.S., and with church membership and attendance in a decades-long decline, much of it is underutilized. Properties can also prove to be a financial burden. Many orders of nuns have\nturned to selling convents\nas they seek to shore up funds to care for their aging sisters.\nReal estate has seized on the opportunity to snag prime, historic properties. Hoteliers Alex and Sue Glasscock bought a 140-acre estate in Tuxedo Park, New York, from the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate for $11 million in 2023. They opened the east coast outpost of their wellness retreat the Ranch Malibu in the 40,000-square-foot mansion that once housed the sisters.\nWhile church land is eaten up across the U.S., it\u2019s a growing phenomenon in South Florida. Tal Levinson and Eric Malinasky are\nplanning a 500-unit residential development\non a former church site in Fort Lauderdale. Billionaire Steve Ross is planning a luxury condominium in West Palm Beach on the waterfront site of\nTemple Israel\n, which will be relocating within the city.\nIn voting down the YIGBY proposal this week, Miami commissioners cited concerns it would incite an open season for historic church properties.\n\u201cI\u2019m not typically this firm on \u2018no,\u2019 but this is a \u2018no\u2019 in every respect for me,\u201d Commissioner Christine King said. \u201cIt is a solid, firm, I\u2019m not crossing the line, I am not bending, modifying. These churches, historic churches \u2014 all they have is their land.\u201d\nKing\u2019s district had the largest share of properties zoned as religious or civic in use in the city, according to the outlet. Her district had 247 of the more than 660 parcels that were identified.\nThis could be \u201cdisastrous for our churches, particularly our historic churches,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not have the expertise to negotiate deals such as this.\u201d\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "The race for office space in San Francisco has put a\u00a0 lead foot on the pedal, and there are few, if any, signs of a slowdown.\nThroughout the year, headlines, analysts\u2019 data, and claims from brokers implied that 2025 was already San Francisco\u2019s get-right year. Then, numbers reported earlier this week from real estate analytics firm Co-Star indicated that leasing in the fourth quarter trumped the rest and kicked into yet another gear. Between October and December, San Francisco\u2019s office market \u2014 for which Co-Star combines San Francisco and San Mateo counties \u2014 notched 2 million square feet of net absorption according to the reports.\nIn San Francisco proper, this momentum helped bring the city\u2019s office vacancy rate down from 34.4 to 32.8 percent, according to CBRE, which also reported that nearly 90 percent of that absorption in the fourth quarter absorption \u2014 and throughout 2025 for that matter \u2014 happened through Class A leases. Yet, CBRE\u2019s report warned, don\u2019t expect the appetite for Class A buildings to eventually energize interest in Class B. Instead, the firm predicts that as high-quality offices get eaten up, it will give way to new construction of ever newer, nicer offices.\nArtificial intelligence has driven the hype, but the burgeoning industry isn\u2019t alone in its search for space. CBRE says companies are actively on the prowl for about 8 million square feet of office, and companies beyond the AI sector account for more than half of the current demand.\nBy all indications, the first quarter of 2026 is off to a similarly fast start. On Friday, Transamerica Pyramid operator SHVO\nannounced that it inked three leases for a total of 25,000 square feet in its own Class A trophy office building.\nSHVO CEO Michael Shvo said one of the leases went for more than $300 per square foot, which for 4,000 square feet works out at $1.2 million per year. Shvo claimed this is not only a San Francisco record, but a West Coast record, and the second highest price-per-square-foot lease in the country. The Real Deal could not independently verify this claim.\nThe leases come on the heels of a busy December, during which SHVO signed on nine tenants for 220,000 square feet. The building, one of San Francisco\u2019s most emblematic, now sits at 85 percent occupied, according to a SHVO spokesperson.\nA tale of two Beaux Arts buildings\nAfter Bay Area-based Kylli defaulted on a $350 million loan in November 2024, the fate of the 22-story office tower at 225 Bush Street that the company used as collateral has sat stuck.\nNow it has begun to wiggle free. Earlier this week, the loan\u2019s special servicer, K-Star Asset Management LLC, is reportedly in discussion with JLL\nabout putting the loan on the market\n. If the debt does indeed go up for sale, the buyer could foreclose on the property or work out a deal with Kylli to take over the building.\nLike many older office buildings in San Francisco \u2014 this one, designed by George W. Kelham for John D. Rockefeller in the 1920s \u2014 225 Bush St.\u2019s fortunes have fallen dramatically since the pandemic. The building went from fully occupied in 2020 to more than 60 percent vacant as of September 2025, according to Morningstar Credit.\nOnly a few blocks away at 685 Market St., Brookfield Office Properties\nhas put up the 10-story Monadnock Building for sale\n. This 1907 Beaux-Arts structure, with nearly 200,000 square feet of office space is 75 percent leased. The anchor tenant, tech platform company Notion Labs Inc, occupies about half the building and has 10 years left on its lease. Brookfield bought the property for $80 million in 2013, and followed it up with a renovation. JLL is brokering the sale, and has not listed a price.\nSan Francisco has operated as a feast or famine market. While leasing is up, few trophy spaces have traded hands and older office properties have cratered in value. One private equity executive told The Real Deal earlier this month that money has been tight for office purchases in the city. Yet, the well-leased Monadnock Building brings something slightly different to the table \u2013 a historic structure with an anchor tenant and\u00a0 some space to lease.\n",

        "content": "A 700-unit Upper East Side apartment tower has taken a steep valuation hit, highlighting the growing financial strain on rent-regulated housing in New York.\nYorkshire Towers, a 21-story white-brick rental building at 305 East 86th Street owned by Meyer Chetrit and Stellar Management, lost about 30 percent of its value over the past four years, according to an appraisal cited by\nCrain\u2019s\n. Morningstar Credit Analytics pegged the combined value of Yorkshire Towers and a smaller nearby property at $678 million, down from $954 million in 2022.\nThe drop comes despite strong demand for market-rate units in the building, which features an indoor pool, 24-hour doorman service and proximity to the Second Avenue Q train. Market rents in the property averaged roughly $5,000 a month in 2022 and now reach nearly $16,000 for top-end apartments, according to StreetEasy.\nThe problem is the other half of the rent roll. About 300 of Yorkshire Towers\u2019 apartments are rent regulated, limiting income growth as operating costs climb. Rents set by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board have lagged increases in insurance, labor and repairs, while the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act sharply curtailed owners\u2019 ability to raise rents after vacancies.\nChetrit and Stellar bought Yorkshire Towers and neighboring Lexington Towers about 12 years ago with plans to boost revenue by combining regulated units with market-rate apartments to create larger, higher-rent homes, Fitch Ratings reported. By 2022, only 57 of 311 targeted apartments had been renovated before the 2019 law undercut the strategy.\nFinancial stress followed. In 2024, after the owners failed to make a required reserve fund contribution, the property\u2019s $540 million mortgage was transferred to special servicing. The complex carries roughly $714 million in total debt. Lenders later agreed to\nextend the loan\nto at least 2030.\nChetrit\u2019s attorney, Leo Jacobs, disputed the framing of the valuation drop, telling Crain\u2019s the decline reflects higher interest rates rather than a fundamental cut in value. Stellar did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe situation at Yorkshire Towers mirrors a broader trend. Appraisers and brokers say buildings with heavy concentrations of regulated units are routinely seeing double-digit valuation declines.\nCity officials have also acknowledged the risk: in a recent\nbankruptcy case\ninvolving Pinnacle Group\u2019s rent-stabilized portfolio, the city warned that low rents could make buildings economically unsustainable, leading to deferred maintenance and potential disrepair.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

To see the top multifamily sales in Palmdale in 2025 click\nhere\n.\nChaparral Apartments is a 296-unit property, spanning 18.21 acres with 16 two-story garden-style buildings. At 213,664 square feet, Chaparral Apartments is one of the largest multifamily assets in Palmdale. The property has 72 studios, 164 one-bedroom apartments and 60 two-bedroom pads.\nThe $71 million price for 38441 5th Street West was warranted due to the \u201cquality and location of the asset,\u201d Steven Goldstein of Northmarq\u2019s Los Angeles Multifamily Investment Sales said. He brokered the deal along with Northmarq\u2019s Jeff Benson and Sam Neumark. In addition, Goldstein said, the property is \u201cwell-managed, which allowed the property to command rents higher than the comparable properties while also limiting the initial CapEx needed.\u201d\nAmenities include two swimming pools, three tennis courts, a fitness center, a business center, two laundry facilities, a movie theater and a resident lounge. The property offers parking for 488 vehicles.\nLiberty Equities chose to sell the asset in order to \u201crepatriate the capital to different asset types and move the money back closer to their headquarters in Florida,\u201d Goldstein said.\n",

The total was slightly higher than the\nprevious period\n, which saw 21 luxury homes enter contract.\nUnit No. 11 North will span 3,200 square feet and have five bedrooms and four bathrooms. Plans for the apartment also include 11-foot ceilings and partial views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe developers tapped a team with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Cathy Franklin, to head sales at the project, which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027. The team began marketing units off of floor plans on Jan. 15 and has so far scored signed contracts for four of the 22 condos. All four of the buyers appear to be local.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include doormen, a fitness center, squash court, plunge pool and billiards room.\nThe developers nabbed a\n$195 million loan\nfrom Deutsche Bank and JVP Management in August 2024 to finance the construction of the project \u2014 a $95 million assemblage that the firms put together between 2019 and early 2024.\nThe second most expensive home to land an inked deal was Suite 1 at 240 Riverside Boulevard, with an asking price of $14.4 million. The 4,700-square-foot apartment spans the entire 30th floor and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features two terraces, a library and views of the Hudson River.\nThe unit, which last traded for $15.5 million in 2016, hit the market in November 2023 asking $18 million. Amenities at the building, known as the Heritage, include a fitness center, swimming pool, landscaped courtyard and garage.\nNest Seekers\u2019 the Kim Team, led by Andy Kim, had the listing.\nOf the 23 properties to find buyers, 15 were condos, seven were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes asked a combined $190 million, which works out to an average of $8.3 million and a median of $7.1 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 4 percent.\n",

        "content": "Oleg Cassini\u2019s former Gramercy Park townhouse has sold for the second time in three years.\nThe late fashion designer\u2019s former home at 135 East 19th Street sold for $7.4 million, according to public records. The home previously traded in a 2022 auction for\n$5 million\n.\nAt one point, the home had been valued near $15 million, close to what the seller initially tried to flip the house for after one year after buying it. The seller lopped off the price by the millions until turning the listing over to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eleonora Srugo in July, asking $8 million.\nFour months later, the home was in contract. Serhant\u2019s Ryan Serhant brought the buyer, according to StreetEasy.\nThe most recent sales process was markedly less painful than the previous sale, which came after Cassini\u2019s grandson\nsued in an effort to force a sale of the home\nas part of a larger battle over his grandfather\u2019s $55 million estate.\nThe sale comes in the same month that another former Cassini property has also found a buyer amid legal turmoil. Owned by Nestor Cassini\u2019s sister, Peggy Nestor, the 18,000-square-foot home at 15 East 63rd has been tied up in\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor years as the sisters have\nstymied efforts\nto sell the home, according to court filings.\nBut the trustee overseeing the sale of the home as part of the bankruptcy reported finding a buyer willing to pay\n$34.5 million\nand is seeking court approval to move ahead with the sales process using that offer as a stalking horse bid.\nCassini, who rose to prominence styling celebrities like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had secretly married Marianne Nestor Cassini, who many had thought was his business partner until after his death in 2006. In 2018, Nestor Cassini was jailed for six months for failing to comply with court orders in regards to how to distribute her late husband\u2019s estate, of which Cassini\u2019s four grandchildren maintained they were entitled to half.\nThe buyer, who is concealed by a limited liability company, is getting a fixer-upper, which may explain why the home has still sold so far below its previously assessed value.\nBuilt in 17th-century Amsterdam, the home has been taken apart and moved twice: first in 1845 from Europe to the Upper West Side, and then again in 1910, to its current location, where it was reimagined into its Gothic Revival style for sugar magnate Joseph B. Thomas.\nCassini used the home as a party house, hosting salons and some of his A-list clients and romantic interests, like Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly, Srugo told the New York Post.\n\u201cSomeone should restore it to its glory,\u201d she said.\nSpanning almost 7,000 square feet and four stories, the home has six bedrooms and five full bathrooms. The first floor, which has a Flemish stone floor at the entrance, features a large living room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, paneled walls, a stone fireplace and adjacent glass solarium with a stone fountain inside. Every floor has stained-glass windows.\n",

        "content": "The latest bid to give developers a break on Los Angeles\u2019 big, bad\n\u201cmansion tax\u201d\ncomes from a Democratic Socialist, with the progressive president of the Los Angeles City Council seconding the motion.\nFourth District Los Angeles City Councilmember Nithya Raman\u2019s motion to create exemptions to the two-tiered real property tax called\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n\u2014 and commonly known as ULA \u2014 is set to go before the council on Jan. 27. Eighth District colleague Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who serves as president of the 15-seat council, has signed on to support the effort.\nRaman is proposing a ballot measure for June 2 that would create a permanent 15-year carveout for new or \u201csubstantial rehabilitation\u201d of multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. The clock on each exemption would start at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued.\nCurrently, ULA applies a 4 percent tax on transactions starting at $5.3 million and it bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nVoters approved Measure ULA in 2022 as a levy aimed at generating revenue to fund housing production and homelessness programs. The real estate industry has argued that the tax, which went into effect in 2023, has chilled financing for new construction and the flow of deals overall.\nRaman has been a supporter of ULA since its inception, and she is casting the proposed care-out as a bid to preserve the tax in the face of steady attempts to roll it back amid a reduced pace of multifamily development that is compounding the local housing crunch. The limited pipeline is increasingly seen as linked to ULA tamping down lending.\n\u201cTo be honest about the conditions that we\u2019re operating in, multifamily and mixed-use housing production has\nslowed\nin the city of L.A.,\u201d she said during Friday\u2019s council meeting. \u201cLenders are pulling back from the market entirely, and there\u2019s multiple efforts to undo ULA entirely, to take it away from us completely.\u201d\nThe specifics around how each asset class is defined in the exemptions are broad. Any property with four or more units would be considered multifamily, while commercial is anything not used for residential.\nRaman\u2019s motion would also address concerns raised by Pacific Palisades owners whose properties were damaged in the\nPalisades Fire\n. It would allow those impacted by a natural disaster to be exempt from paying the ULA tax with proof of \u201chardship.\u201d If this portion of the amendment was passed, it would be made retroactive to January 2025 for Palisades Fire victims.\nRaman\u2019s proposal is significantly broader than an idea floated by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass in\nOctober\nwhen she called on the council to pass an ordinance that would allow for a one-time ULA exemption over a three-year period for owners of homes, condominiums and other residential properties hit by the Palisades Fire.\nTo date, Measure ULA has generated over $1 billion since it went into effect, according to data from the Los Angeles Housing Department as of the end of last year.\nThe largest share of that revenue \u2014 about 60 percent, or $441.5 million \u2014 came from sales of single-family homes above the $5.3 million floor.\nThat\u2019s across 864 transactions, netting an average of nearly $511,000 per deal.\nThe area that\u2019s generating the largest amount of that single-family revenue is District 11, Los Angeles\u2019 Westside. That includes neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Pacific Palisades and Venice.\nCommercial, which does not include multifamily or mixed-use projects, accounts for the next largest bucket of ULA revenue at $354 million or about 24 percent of the overall pie.\nThis is a developing story.",

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the legislation into law in October.\nThe rule applies broadly, covering images in online listings, brochures and other promotional materials. It also reaches beyond brokerages to photography firms and Multiple Listing Services, which feed listings to portals like\nZillow\nand Redfin. Under the law, the disclosure statement is necessary for \u201calterations that add, remove or change elements in the image, such as interior fixtures, furniture, appliances, flooring, walls, paint color, hardscape, landscape, facade, floor plans and exterior features on or visible from the property such as streetlights, utility poles, views through windows and neighboring properties.\u201d\nBill author Rep. Gail Pellerin, who represents Santa Cruz, drafted the legislation after her former chief of staff drove an hour to a home she was looking to buy only to find that the kitchen featured in the listing photo did not exist, bearing just a range hood and no cabinets, countertops or appliances. The law is one of several ways state legislators are working to regulate the rapidly\ngrowing use of artificial intelligence\n, and follows a similar law passed in Wisconsin in December set to take effect next year.\n\u201cAI has made the barrier to entry very low,\u201d Jeff Klein, managing director of Open Homes Photography, told the Chronicle of the growing practice of \u201cvirtual staging.\u201d The issue lies with generative AI\u2019s tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d images such as views from a room that doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe law does not \u201cestablish a set penalty or fine for failure to disclose,\u201d Pellerin told the Chronicle. \u201cHowever, it would fall on the [California] Department of Real Estate to address any violation per their disciplinary process.\u201d\nThe\nstate\u2019s Department of Real Estate\ncould step in with penalties of its choosing. \u201cDepending on the egregiousness, we could take corrective action, ranging from revoking a license to a slap on the wrist,\u201d Stephen Lerner, the department\u2019s assistant commissioner for legal affairs, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Affiliates of Ante, the family office of Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, are busy making real estate trades across three states.\nAnte spent more than $69 million over the past few months acquiring 186 apartments, according to public records first\nreported\nby CoStar. The buying spree spans Wisconsin, Brooklyn and most recently Chicago, adding another layer to the star\u2019s expanding investments.\nThe latest deal was on Chicago\u2019s North Side. An Ante affiliate paid just over $21 million for\nHarmony Apartments\n, a four-story, 56-unit building at 4513 North Clark Street in Uptown. The property was completed in 2024 by a group of local investors and closed Jan. 7, backed by an $11 million loan from Old National Bank, property records show.\nThe Uptown apartment complex was part of a family feud by its builders in 2024. Chicago builder Michael J. Lerner of MCZ Development and his wife, Jamie Lerner,\nsued their son\n, Michael N. Lerner, accusing him of preparing to sell the property and keep all proceeds for himself, despite previously agreeing to share 50 percent with a trust controlled by his mother.\nEssex Realty Group brokered the sale, with Jordan Gottlieb and Rick Ofman handling the transaction. Essex announced the deal earlier this month, though Antetokounmpo\u2019s involvement was not publicly known at the time. The building\u2019s ground-floor retail space is slated for the Black Ensemble Theater, part of a broader push to establish a new arts and cultural hub in the neighborhood.\nThe Chicago purchase is about 85 miles south of the Bucks\u2019 home arena and just north of the city\u2019s Greektown, a geographic overlap for a player nicknamed \u201cThe Greek Freak.\u201d\nIn November, the\nfamily office\npaid nearly $25.2 million for two neighboring buildings in Prospect Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn. The properties, known collectively as\nThe Lawrence\nat 111 Clarkson Street and 520 Parkside Avenue, were completed in 2018 and 2019 and total 50 units. The deal immediately fueled speculation that Antetokounmpo could be Knicks-bound, amid chatter that the two-time NBA most valuable player will soon be traded.\nWisconsin has seen similar action. In October, Ante paid $11.75 million for The Atwater, a 39-unit building in Shorewood, completed in 2023 and developed by Pat Connaughton, a former Bucks teammate. A month later, the family office spent another $11.6 million for The Emerson, a 41-unit building in Madison completed in 2021, according to the outlet.\nThe Antetokounmpo family, which includes Giannis\u2019 brother and Bucks teammate Thanasis, has also invested in the Milwaukee Brewers, Nashville SC and online candy retailer Candy Funhouse.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nahla Capital is suing the seller of the iconic Raleigh property in Miami Beach over a deal involving the use of Peter Marino\u2019s designs.\nNahla Raleigh LLC filed a complaint in New York against BSD Raleigh Trustee LLC last week. In October, BSD Raleigh, a trustee of the Raleigh Land Trust, sold the 3-acre oceanfront assemblage at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue to Nahla\nfor $270 million\n.\nKevin Neuner, Shvo\u2019s CFO, signed the deed on behalf of the seller.\nShvo, the company led by developer Michael Shvo, declined to comment, citing the fact that it is not a party to the lawsuit. It\u2019s unclear who controls the seller LLC following the sale of the property.\nNew York-based Nahla, led by Genghis Hadi, alleged that it\u2019s entitled to receive $10 million that\u2019s in escrow because of the seller\u2019s \u201cfailure to carry through on its promise that buyer would be able to use certain designs by Peter Marino and Peter Marino Architect,\u201d according to the complaint.\nMarino and his firm are not named as defendants. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Hadi of Nahla also did not respond to requests for comment.\nMichael Shvo and his partners planned to redevelop the Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels into a luxury condo and hotel project with a private club, but Shvo failed to hold onto the property. Shvo and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds,\npaid $243 million\nfor the Raleigh assemblage in 2019 and planned a $1 billion redevelopment.\nA spokesperson for Revetas, the London-based fund manager that was tapped to reposition Deutsche Finance America\u2019s investments, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nShvo and his partners tapped Marino, a New York-based architect known for his leather-clad biker style and his designs of high-end retail stores, to design the Raleigh alongside Kobi Karp of Miami-based Kobi Karp Architecture and Interior Design. Shvo also inked an agreement with Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts to brand the planned 17-story, 44-unit condo tower and manage the 60-key hotel.\nShvo had started work on the project by the time it sold in mid-October.\nThe seller \u201crepeatedly emphasized\u201d its partnership with Marino and Marino Architect during negotiations with Nahla, and the LLC agreed to deposit $10 million into escrow, pending an agreement to assign a license for the designs to the buyer, according to the suit. If the LLC failed to obtain consent from Marino within 45 days, the buyer would be entitled to receive the funds in escrow, according to the complaint.\n\u201cSeller further agreed that the Marino consent would \u2018substantially\u2019 be in the form of a certificate and consent attached to the purchase agreement, subject to any \u2018reasonable modifications\u2019 requested by Marino and Marino Architect,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThat agreement was extended when the seller allegedly failed to make an introduction to Nahla. That introduction was made Dec. 11, with Hadi, Shvo and Marino present.\nBut on Jan. 8, Marino\u2019s attorneys told Nahla that Marino and his firm would only agree to allow Nahla to use its designs if they agreed to the following: that Marino\u2019s firm was not the architect of record, that Marino\u2019s firms make no representation that the designs comply with local laws or regulations, that the buyer use those designs at its own risk, and that the buyer must exclude Marino\u2019s name and the name of his firm, among other requirements.\nNahla responded that it could not agree to the conditions because \u201cthey were materially more restrictive\u201d than what Nahla signed up for in the purchase and sale agreement.\nTwo days before the extended deadline expired, the seller LLC demanded the escrow agent return the $10 million payment, calling Marino\u2019s conditions \u201creasonable.\u201d\nShvo\u2019s sale of the Raleigh development largely marked an exit from Miami Beach for Shvo, who also, along with his partners, planned three office projects in the city.\nLast year, he and his partners sold their\nAlton Road office development site\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to Infinity Collective for $28.3 million last year. Shvo also planned to develop a clock tower building on Lincoln Road, but his firm did not end up purchasing the property.\nAnother Shvo affiliate still owns an office development site on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n",

Renderings for the project showcase a ring-shaped structure with central green space and a new park opening directly to the waterfront. A target date for completion has not been disclosed.\nBuilding the new Outer Harbor cruise terminal and revamping the World Cruise Center in\nSan Pedro\nwill \u201callow [the port] to capture more of the rapidly growing cruise business, while also establishing Los Angeles as the primary West Coast gateway for cruise operations,\u201d Gene Seroka, the Port\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cThis project will also be a huge win for our port communities, who will greatly benefit from the economic activity generated by such significant public and private investment in our L.A. waterfront.\u201d\nEach\ncruise ship\nthat visits Los Angeles generates approximately $1.3 million in local economic activity, according to port estimates cited by Urbanize. Last year, the port saw 241 cruises.\nIt isn\u2019t the only new development slated for the Port of Los Angeles complex.\nPier 500\n, a proposed new marine container terminal, is in the works at the port. The project is envisioned as a 200-acre site along the port\u2019s Pier 400 Channel that would bring two new berths and approximately 3,000 feet of new available wharf space to the southern end of Terminal Island. It would utilize an existing site where the port identified 124 acres of submerged infrastructure added during the construction of the adjacent Pier 400 more than two decades ago. With the expansion, the new terminal would increase cargo efficiency at the port by accommodating larger, newer cargo ships.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The probe has been active since at least early 2024 and could still end without charges.\nThe investigation\u2019s full scope remains unclear. But if it produces an indictment, it would add another hit to the legacy of the Adams administration, which was battered by overlapping corruption probes into top aides and allies.\nCarone, a lawyer and dominant figure in Brooklyn Democratic circles, was one of Adams\u2019s closest political confidants for more than a decade. He played a central role in Adams\u2019s 2021 mayoral campaign and served as chief of staff during the mayor\u2019s first year in office before decamping for the private sector.\nAfter leaving City Hall in January 2023, Carone launched Oaktree Solutions, a consulting and lobbying firm that quickly attracted clients across multiple industries. In May 2024, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to several of those clients after obtaining the firm\u2019s bank records, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry. The subpoenaed clients spanned a range of businesses, including real estate.\nLater in 2024, investigators appeared to focus more closely on real estate partnerships and other business ventures tied to Carone, one person familiar with the matter told the Times.\nIn a statement, Carone denied wrongdoing, attributing the investigation to political animus and\nresentment over his success. The FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.\nThe probe also brushes up against Carone\u2019s former law firm, Abrams Fensterman, which has\nbeen linked in civil litigation to sprawling insurance fraud schemes alleged by Geico. Neither Carone nor the firm has been charged with wrongdoing, and both have said they were victims of fraud, not participants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property was purchased in 2021 for $6.9 million before construction began. Arana and Herskowitz enlisted designer Tiffany Harris on the project, which includes a whole wing dedicated to health and wellness with a cold plunge, 100-foot pool, infrared sauna, salon, pilates studio and weightlifting room.\nDubbed Villa Serenique, the 20,000-square-foot home sits behind gates and has parking for more than 10 cars, a theater, bar, wine cellar, soccer field, pickleball court and gardens.\nShould the residence sell at anything close to ask, it would be subject to the upper tier of the\nMeasure United to House L.A. tax\n. The two-tier tax applies a 5.5 percent assessment on trades of $10.6 million or more. Properties starting at $5.3 million are taxed 4 percent.\nThe Tigertail home is in line with many of the properties sold or bought by Arana\u2019s A-list clientele.\nThe cast member of the canceled \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d reality TV show on Netflix was at one time marketing the former property of\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck\nat 2571 Wallingford Drive in Beverly Crest. He\u2019s also worked with LeBron James, Lady Gaga and Larry David.\nArana is upbeat on the high-end market, which he said has been fueled by a number of recent closings near or above the $40 million mark.\n\u201cThat tells me that consumer confidence is back and I\u2019m confident that we are going to have a great 2026,\u201d Arana said.\nThe final day of last year ended with the $35 million closing of 1309 Davies Drive in Beverly Hills. The home, which traded for over $3,804 per square foot, was once owned by singer Ricky Martin and in later years Oscar winner Michael Caine.\nBrentwood\n, where Arana\u2019s latest listing is located, saw its fair share of high-end trades in the latter half of 2025.\nIn October, a property known as\nMelhill Estate\ntraded off market in Brentwood for $53 million. That came on the heels of financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife selling their Brentwood estate named Ocho Manos at\n11740 Crescenda Street\nfor $44 million.",

        "content": "Eleven years after buying The Streets at Woodfield shopping center, a retail arm of New York-based private equity giant Blackstone took a bruising loss on the suburban plaza.\nBlackstone\u2019s affiliate, Perform Properties, sold The Streets at Woodfield for $69 million to Hartford, Connecticut-based Hutensky Capital Partners last week, after buying it for $168.5 million in early 2015, public records show. The sale of the center at 601 North Martingale Road in Schaumburg comes out to a massive 59 percent discount off Blackstone\u2019s purchase price.\nThe price equates to about $100 per square foot.\nBlackstone took out a $89 million mortgage against the 693,000-square-foot property from Deutsche Bank at the time of the purchase, but later paid it off in full in early 2020, according to public records.\nAbout a year and a half after paying off the Deutsche Bank loan, Blackstone put The Streets at Woodfield on the market, according to prior reporting on the shopping center.\nThe retail plaza suffered from the closure of anchor tenant Carson Pirie Scott. The department store was founded in Chicago and was once prominent throughout the U.S., but closed all its stores after its parent company, The Bon-Ton Stores, filed for bankruptcy in 2018.\nThe 143,000-square-foot Carson\u2019s space at The Streets at Woodfield was ultimately filled by a Restoration Hardware outlet, but at a lower rent, prior reporting indicated.\nThe latest sale is part of a broader shakeup in the retail sector, which has faced upheaval since the growth of online shopping.\nAs of late 2025, retail leasing was down 17 percent, year-over-year, across metro Chicago, according to Matthews Real Estate Services.\nSeveral enclosed suburban shopping malls in the Chicago area\nare in the process of redevelopment plans\nafter facing severe financial distress. That includes a mall owned by another New York-based investor, Feil Organization.\nAfter narrowly avoiding foreclosure, Feil announced an infusion of\n$8 million for renovations\nto the North Riverside Park Mall last February. In the early months of the pandemic, Feil allegedly nearly defaulted on a $75 million note for the property, but secured an extension on its maturity date.\nSmaller scale open-air shopping plazas like The Streets at Woodfield have been faring somewhat better. Some may have been buoyed by\nthe strength of Chicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market\n.\nLate last year, Charlotte-based Barings bought\na 149,200-square-foot Jewel Osco-anchored shopping center in Naperville\nfor $54 million from Buffalo Grove-based Shorewood Development. Shorewood had bought that shopping center, at 1201-1316 South Naper Boulevard, in 2021 for $25.5 million and renovated it, though it\u2019s unclear how much Shorewood invested in the renovations.\nStill, the loss of Carson\u2019s may have been the beginning of the end for Blackstone\u2019s investment in The Streets at Woodfield.\nRepresentatives of Blackstone and Hutensky Capital Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "The town of\nPacifica\nis divided \u2014 literally \u2014 over Airbnb and other short-term rentals.\nThe Bay Area community south of San Francisco implemented strict new\nregulations for short-term rentals\nlast year that have already\ndriven away\nmany permitted\nAirbnbs\n, Vrbo properties and other similar vacation rentals, but the rules only applied to inland Pacifica east of Pacific Coast Highway, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nNow, neighborhoods along the coast are in a holding pattern as the California Coastal Commission mulls approval of the ordinance. The state agency has jurisdiction over the area, leaving neighborhoods like Sharp Park and Pedro Point as short-term rental hotspots in the town.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically converted this entire street\u2026 into a row of unregulated hotels,\u201d one local resident told the Chronicle, calling out multiple\nshort-term rentals\nnear her home on Beach Boulevard, including a three-bedroom house owned by a vacation rental company next door. Another Pacifica resident said \u201cit\u2019s like living next to a dive bar and a Holiday Inn.\u201d\nThe California Coastal Commission will consider the matter at its meeting next week. If the agency makes a decision, it will conclude a saga that has dragged on for years as short-term rentals in California face various municipal and state regulations depending on location. Coastal Commission staff have recommended approving the ordinance in a memo last week, despite calling the \u201cstringent\u201d rules that would be \u201csome of the most severe in the coastal zone at this point.\u201d A final vote on the matter is expected by early April, though it could be postponed by up to a year.\nThe strict rules require hosts to prove that a unit is their primary residence and caps unhosted rentals at 60 nights per year, lower than San Francisco\u2019s 90-night cap and San Jose\u2019s 180-night limit. Before the ordinance took effect following city council approval last July, Pacifica had 147 permitted short-term rentals, below the citywide cap of 150. Once the regulations were implemented, nearly half of those permit holders did not renew their credentials, including approximately 23 on the coast and 50 inland, according to a city memo cited by the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Kingshill co-listed the estate with Jason Lee Villarreal, and the sellers ultimately took the auction route, closing the deal through\nConcierge Auctions\nin December.\nPerched on a hillside overlooking Royal Oaks Country Club, the mansion was designed for large-scale entertaining. Amenities include a private bowling alley, a 13-seat home theater, a 3,000-gallon aquarium stocked with albino mini sharks and an infinity-edge pool with views of the adjacent lake and golf course, the outlet reported.\nDesigned by architect Paul Olson, the estate features 72 custom walnut doors, including an 18-foot-tall entry door once believed to be among the largest ever installed in a private home. Additional highlights include two full kitchens, a 260-bottle wine display, a sauna and a fully outfitted barbershop.\nVan Exel, who earned an All-Star nod with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1998, spent 13 seasons in the NBA and maintained Houston ties during off-seasons.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A federal judge dismissed a discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a former\nNational Association of Realtors\nemployee, delivering a legal win for the Chicago and Washington, D.C.-based trade group as it continues to work through years of controversy.\nRoshani Sheth, who worked for NAR\u2019s Realtors Information Group subsidiary for five years ending in 2019, failed to provide \u201cplausible\u201d evidence supporting her claims of gender and national-origin discrimination, U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis wrote in a Jan. 13 ruling,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s.\nAlexakis dismissed three of Sheth\u2019s claims with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled. The judge declined to rule on a fourth claim alleging breach of contract, saying it belongs in state court and could not stand on its own after the dismissal of the federal claims.\nSheth filed her lawsuit in September 2024, alleging\nNAR\nretaliated against her after she raised sexual harassment concerns in 2019. Among other claims, she said the organization refused to provide job references after her termination and condoned anonymous text messages from former colleagues that urged her to kill herself.\nThe court found those allegations legally insufficient. On the reference issue, Alexakis wrote that Sheth failed to show NAR\u2019s lack of response to prospective employers was a \u201cdeliberate act of retaliation,\u201d rather than a breakdown in office procedures. On the texts, the judge rejected Sheth\u2019s attempt to link the anonymous messages to\nNAR officials\n, writing that the court \u201cdoes not share Sheth\u2019s belief\u201d that the association had any agency in the conduct.\nAlexakis also pointed to a settlement agreement Sheth signed when she was fired in 2019, which released NAR from claims related to its actions at the time. That agreement, the judge wrote, undercut Sheth\u2019s attempt to frame later events as retaliation tied to her termination.\nSheth\u2019s complaint painted a picture of a toxic workplace, including allegations that a senior executive denied her a promotion after she complained about an outside partner\u2019s alleged sexual advances, and that another leader repeatedly referred to her as an immigrant despite her being born in the Chicago area. Several of the executives named in the suit have since left or retired from NAR.\nThe trade group welcomed the ruling and said it is pleased with the decision in a statement to the outlet, declining further comment. Sheth\u2019s attorney did not respond to requests for comment made by Crain\u2019s.\nThe case landed amid a turbulent period for NAR, which has faced leadership shakeups, sexual harassment allegations, scrutiny over spending, and most significantly, a 2023 jury verdict finding it conspired to keep real estate commissions artificially high. The association has been in turnaround mode under CEO Nykia Wright, who joined after Sheth\u2019s tenure.\nWith the lawsuit\u2019s dismissal,\nNAR\nbecomes the latest Chicago-based real estate institution to put retaliation claims behind it, following the Appraisal Institute\u2019s settlement last year with its former CEO.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "More cash and construction are flowing into Hillwood\u2019s AllianceTexas in Fort Worth, this time with a massive warehouse expansion.\nThe Dallas-based developer is planning an estimated $140 million expansion of an existing shell warehouse building called Alliance Center North 4 at 15301 North Beach Street, according to a plan filed Friday with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The plan outlines a scope of work that includes a new addition of about 371,160 square feet to the west side of the building, though TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe planned improvements include 55,000-square-feet on two floors, with additional office space \u2014 both open and private \u2014 as well as break rooms and conference space. The addition amounts to more than half the size of the existing warehouse. Built in 2023, Alliance Center North 4\u2019s main area consists of 614,640 square feet, according to the Denton Central Appraisal District, and was appraised at almost $48 million last year.\nConstruction is expected to begin in mid-March and finish before December, the filing shows. GSR Andrade Architects are the design firm for the project.\nA spokesperson for AllianceTexas said Hillwood declined to provide comment on the project.\nThe building is part of\nHillwood\u2019s AllianceTexas\n, a 27,000-acre master-planned development in north Fort Worth. Private developers have invested more than $14 billion in its office, retail and industrial space in the 35 years since the development began, and the development has generated more than 66,000 jobs and an estimated $130 billion economic impact since 1990, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\nThe development\u2019s\nlogistical mix\nof air, rail and highway access continues to find takers for its properties.\nLast year, Wistron InfoComm USA \u2014 a subsidiary of a Taiwanese manufacturing powerhouse partnering with Nvidia to assemble\nnext-generation supercomputers\n\u2014 snapped up two properties in the development. Winstron bought a 324,600-square-foot building at 15200 Heritage Parkway from Trammell Crow Company, which will serve as its primary site with a $580 million investment. It also bought the 767,000-square-foot Westport 14 at 14601 Mobility Way, from Hillwood, where it will spend another $181 million, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe complex is also attracting satellite developments looking to cash in on providing nearby housing and entertainment options to AllianceTexas\u2019 workforce. Steve McKeever\u2019s\nNorth City\n, a long-awaited $1 billion mixed-use development spanning over 148 acres in north Fort Worth, is aiming to become an \u201curban village\u201d and a pedestrian-friendly entertainment hub near AllianceTexas. McKeever broke ground recently on two of three planned apartment complexes.\n",

        "content": "The City Council doesn\u2019t have the votes to overturn former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\nDemocratic Council members met on Monday to discuss the bill, which Adams vetoed on his final day in office. At the time, the mayor indicated that the bill \u201cunjustifiably\u201d restricted the pool of potential buyers of certain buildings and created \u201csignificant operational and administrative challenges\u201d for city agencies.\nDuring a Democratic conference on Monday, it became clear that not enough members favor overriding the veto. A member who attended the conference told\nThe Real Deal\nthat constitutional issues raised by the city\u2019s Law Department caused some supporters to drop off.\nThe Council needs a supermajority, or 34 votes, to override Adams\u2019 veto and had 30 days to do so.\u00a0Unless the Council drums up more votes before Thursday, the bill will not be put to the floor.\nCOPA would have given city-approved nonprofits, as well as joint ventures between nonprofits and for-profit companies, the first opportunity to purchase certain multifamily buildings that are distressed or have a soon-to-expire affordability requirement. Those approved entities would have also had the chance to match competing bids.\nThe Council\napproved\nCOPA in December with 30 votes. Council member Julie Menin, now speaker, was one of eight members who abstained from the vote\nBefore its passage, the measure was amended to reduce the pool of eligible buildings and shorten the period of time that nonprofits and eligible joint ventures can exclusively vie for properties.\nStill, the changes were not enough to win over industry critics. The measure was vehemently opposed by landlord groups, arguing that it would scare away would-be buyers and slow down sales. After the mayor vetoed the bill, Ann Korchak, board president of Small Property Owners of New York, or SPONY, said the \u201cmisguided law should never have come this close to seeing the light of day.\u201d\nBefore leaving office, Adams also vetoed three bills that set new rules for the kind of housing the city finances. The Council is declining to revive at least one of those measures, which would have set minimum thresholds for the percentage of two- and three-room apartments in city-funded projects. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear where the other bills stood.\nWhen he was running for mayor, Zohran Mamdani said he would help the City Council\napprove\nCOPA. The City Council could still move forward with another version of the bill. Some critics have suggested launching a pilot program to test out the policy.\n",

        "content": "Homebuying in California\nnearly hit a more than two-decade low last quarter.\nAcross the state, 23,317 existing and newly built homes were sold in November,\nmarking\nthe second-lowest performance in the month in 21 years, the Orange County Register reported, citing Attom data. The sales were down 8 percent over a 12-month period and 30 percent below average.\nSales over the past three years have averaged 26,428 per month \u2014 down 31 percent from the pace of the previous 18 years. Mortgage rates averaged 6.3 percent in the three months ending in November, according to\nFreddie Mac\ndata cited by the Register, down from a 6.5 percent average a year earlier and a recent peak of 7.4 percent in November 2022.\nA year-end dip in mortgage rates did little to stimulate homebuying. The median sales price for a home in California was $735,000 in November, up 0.3 percent year-over-year and about 2 percent below the $751,000 peak set last June. At the same time, appreciation on properties has slowed, with home prices up 9 percent over the past three years compared to 32 percent gains from 2019 to 2022.\nEven if buyers decide to move on a purchase, many decide halfway through the process that they\u2019d rather not buy.

        "content": "Competition for homes in Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhoods\ntook off in January\nafter a sleepy December, kicking off an early spring frenzy for limited inventory.\nNeighborhoods like Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Wicker Park are seeing massive demand and bidding wars for premium properties in the first month of the year, according to real estate agents who work in the areas. Conventional wisdom says March and April are Chicago\u2019s busiest months of the year, but the surge has moved earlier this year, as pent-up demand, low inventory and dropping mortgage rates fuel a\nhot seller\u2019s market\n.\n\u201cJanuary is the new April,\u201d said Matt Laricy, managing broker at Americorp and one of\nChicago\u2019s top agents\nin 2025. \u201cBoomer mentality thinks April is the hottest month. [Now,] January and February are the two hottest months in Chicago.\u201d\nTo prove the point, Laricy said he had a listing for a two-bedroom unit in Lakeview at $899,000. The winning offer on the property was $972,000 \u2014 about 8 percent over its asking price.\nIt\u2019s the same story with most well-priced units in the North Side, Laricy said, where receiving 15 offers on a listing is common, and buyers can expect to pay $50,000 to $75,000 over the asking price.\nOwen Duffy, a Fulton Grace agent who specializes in new construction, said his listings went from a couple of people at open houses in December to 20 or more groups coming through in the first weekend of January.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like someone flips a switch, and the first of January comes, and it just goes,\u201d he said.\nTim Sheahan\n, a Compass agent who also specializes in new developments, said he sold out three separate new developments \u2014 with 26 units in total \u2014 in recent days, with most of the contracts coming in January. One 12-unit project in Lincoln Park drew more than 150 people for tours, he said.\n\u201cThis has been absolutely one of the top two or three [Januaries] that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Sheahan said.\nLess inventory, more buyers\nThe primary driver of the competition is a persistent\nlack of inventory\nin the North Side neighborhoods. Homeowners clinging to 3 percent mortgage rates are staying put, and new construction is hard to come by, Sheahan said. Mortgage rates are about a point lower than they were a year ago, he said, giving people more buying power.\nMeanwhile, new buyers are competing with people who didn\u2019t lock down a property in the fall and are willing to pay a premium, Laricy said.\n\u201cBacklog buyers are buyers who\u2019ve been looking since September, October, and they\u2019ve been waiting for one to come up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen one pops up, they get nervous and they overpay for it.\u201d\nThe high-stakes environment means buyers need to act fast to lock down homes that go under contract in a matter of days, brokers said. For properties listed this month in Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Bucktown, Wicker Park and nearby neighborhoods, dozens went under contract within a week of being listed, listing services show.\n\u201cEvery property is going to sell in 24 to 48 hours or less. And you get to see them for five minutes, so get used to that,\u201d Laricy said.\nDuffy said he\u2019s had buyers look at units in his developments, then spend a week or two looking at what else is on the market. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve come back, then their units are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to jump on something almost right away, it\u2019s tough. You will lose it.\u201d\nAgents said they don\u2019t expect the level of demand in the North Side neighborhoods to slow down over the spring. With few people moving out of homes with low-interest mortgages, Sheahan said new developments are the main source of new inventory.\n\u201cA lot of the inventory that\u2019s out there is inventory we\u2019ve created by building,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough to find building sites, projects take a while, so that \u2026 inventory is a little bit limited. The level of demand is going to remain strong.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A venture of Minneapolis-based Northmarq and Chicago-based developer Bond Companies sold the Kildeer Village Square shopping center for $51 million last week amid a turbulent period in the region\u2019s retail property market.\nHouston-based Fidelis Realty Partners bought the 198,900-square-foot square foot property at 20393 North Rand Road in north suburban Kildeer from Northmarq and Bond in a deal that came out to $256 per square foot, according to public records.\nBond, led by founder and CEO Rob Bond, developed both the Kildeer Village Square Shopping Center and the nearby Kildeer Marketplace. The developer was a minority owner of the Village Square shopping center at time of Fidelis\u2019 purchase, he said. It\u2019s unclear when Northmarq became the majority owner of the shopping center.\nThe Marketplace property, anchored by a Whole Foods Market, was completed in 2012 and the Village Square shopping center, which includes a Nordstrom Rack and a Sierra Trading Post among other tenants, was completed in 2017, according to prior reports.\nBond put both properties on the market in 2019 and said at the time he was open to selling them together, separately or holding onto them.\nThe Marketplace shopping center hasn\u2019t sold.\nThe developer took out a $47.9 million mortgage from Citibank against the Village Square shopping center in 2019, though the total amount the company spent on developing the property is unclear.\nThe buyer, Fidelis, also bought another nearby shopping center, The Shops at Kildeer, for $31 million in the fall of 2025, records show. The seller was a joint venture of New York-based DRA Advisors and Northbrook-based retail investor Pine Tree which had paid $32.8 million for the shopping center in 2018.\nThe transactions come at a time when retail investors are struggling to determine the appropriate value for shopping centers in Chicago and the surrounding area.\nThe rise of online shopping has played a role in decreased vacancy at such shopping centers and led to the redevelopment of\nseveral Chicago area malls\n.\nBlackstone\u2019s affiliate, Perform Properties,\nsold The Streets at Woodfield in Schaumburg\nfor $69 million to Hartford, Connecticut-based Hutensky Capital Partners last week, after buying it for $168.5 million in early 2015. The sale came out to a whopping 59 percent discount or about $100 per square foot. The plaza had struggled since anchor tenant Carson Pirie Scott went out of business and its space was filled by Restoration Hardware Outlet at a lower rent.\nBut the region\u2019s\nstrong multifamily market\nis also boosting retail demand and resulting in decent returns for some sellers.\nIn late 2025, Charlotte-based Barings bought a\n149,200-square-foot Jewel Osco-anchored shopping center\nin Naperville for $54 million from Buffalo Grove-based Shorewood Development. Shorewood had bought that shopping center, at 1201-1316 South Naper Boulevard, in 2021 for $25.5 million and renovated it, though it\u2019s unclear how much Shorewood invested in the renovations.\nEarlier in 2025, Chicago-area investors\nEdward Hassan and Adam Firsel\nsold their Burr Ridge Village Center retail property for $55 million last year, likely a significant return on their 2019 investment of $15 million in the previously distressed suburban Chicago retail property. Their exact return on investment couldn\u2019t be determined, however, as they spent on improving the property, including at least $7 million with a leasing campaign to refill the property.\n",

        "content": "Chicago-based real estate firm R2 picked up a high-vacancy loft property just west of Fulton Market, eyeing a conversion of the building into flexible, small-bay industrial space.\nLast month, R2 paid just over $3 million for the three-story, roughly 49,000-square-foot building at 2130 to 2140 West Fulton Street, according to Cook County property records. CoStar\nreported\nthat the firm rebranded the building as Fulton Lofts and plans to lease it to a mix of creative and light industrial tenants, from furniture studios and art galleries to coffee roasters and podcast operations.\nThe acquisition fits squarely within R2\u2019s growing push into what it calls \u201curban flex\u201d properties \u2014\nolder industrial buildings retooled\nto support a wide range of uses at rents below those commanded by Class A office space. R2 partner Zack Cupkovic told the outlet that the firm wants \u201cto provide urban flex properties with the level of management and service that you\u2019d expect in an office building.\u201d\nThe seller was\nSagard Real Estate\n, formerly known as EverWest Real Estate Investors, which paid $5.1 million for the property in 2017, according to CoStar data and county records. Sagard was represented by a Marcus &amp; Millichap team led by John Abuja and Kyle Hynes, along with Philip Kates, Adam Sklaver and Steven Weinstock. Sagard did not respond to a request for comment from CoStar.\nR2 bought the property out of an auction, financing the deal with a nearly $2.3 million loan from T2 Capital Management. The building is about half vacant and sits near breweries, galleries and other creative users clustered along the western edge of the Kinzie Industrial Corridor.\nR2 recently bet on the\nSalt Shed concert venue\nand a flex conversion on Goose Island that provide examples of what R2 wants to bring to the building, according to the publication.\nThe site\u2019s location \u2014 just north of the\nUnited Center\n\u2014 adds longer-term upside as well. The owners of the Bulls and Blackhawks have floated plans for a $7 billion mixed-use development around the arena, which could further boost demand for nearby workspace.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The vacancy rate for the Bay Area\u2019s 43.3 million square feet of biotech space was 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a third-quarter vacancy rate of 32.8 percent.\nIt\u2019s part of an ongoing upswing in the regional life sciences market, as the Bay Area led the nation in terms of leasing activity and demand for space in the third quarter, per CBRE. Overall, 14.4 million square feet of life sciences space has been added in the Bay Area since 2020.\nTenants are taking advantage of the glut of space. Earlier this month, University of California, San Francisco Health\nsigned a lease\nfor 280,000 square feet at Kilroy Realty Corporation\u2019s Oyster Point development.

Only two large endeavors converting offices for biotech use remain in the pipeline, according to CBRE.

        "content": "A New York-based real estate investment trust shed a massive downtown Houston office tower at a fraction of its prior value, selling the 1 million-square-foot headquarters building of engineering contractor KBR to Namdar Realty Group.\nNet Lease Office Properties, an externally managed REIT advised by affiliates of\nW.P. Carey\n, sold the building at 601 Jefferson Street for $66 million on Jan. 15, according to a Jan. 20 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. JLL Capital Markets confirmed the deal Monday in a news release, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The price equates to roughly $62 per square foot, a steep discount for a 40-story, trophy tower in the city\u2019s central business district.\nHarris County records and industry reports identified\nNamdar Realty Group\nand Mason Asset Management, both based in Great Neck, New York, as the purchasers. The deal also included the adjacent parking garage at 701 Jefferson Street, according to JLL.\nKBR anchors the building, occupying close to 900,000 square feet, or nearly 90 percent of the tower, which is 92 percent leased overall, according to JLL. The 2.94-acre property includes two basement levels in addition to its 40 above-ground floors.\nJLL\u2019s Capital Markets Investment Sales and Advisory team represented the seller, led by managing director Kevin McConn and senior managing director Jeff Hollinden. McConn said in a statement that the building generated \u201ctremendous interest\u201d from private capital sources due to its immediate yield, including several investors new to the Houston market.\nHarris Central Appraisal District records peg the property\u2019s appraised value at $120.4 million as of Jan. 1, underscoring the valuation reset facing downtown office buildings even when backed by long-term corporate tenants.\nThe sale marks a dramatic markdown from the building\u2019s last major trade. A W.P. Carey subsidiary bought the tower, then known as KBR Tower, in 2012 for $174.6 million, meaning the January sale amounts to a 62 percent drop in value.\nW.P. Carey spun off 59 office properties, including the one at 601 Jefferson Street, into Net Lease Office Properties in 2023, as it reduced its exposure to the struggling office sector.\nThe\nNamdar\nacquisition adds another large-format downtown office to its\nportfolio\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Without the funds, the firm will have to sell off properties at an estimated 5.5 percent cap rate, meaning investors would lose between 60 percent and 75 percent of their equity, according to\nThe Promote\n.\nWhen S2 secured a lifeline via the REIT, some industry voices found it innovative, like LinkedIn account CRE Analyst, who\nwrote\n, \u201cIf this is what happened, S2 just showed other syndicators how to survive until \u201925.\u201d\nS2 did, indeed, survive until \u201825. The firm came to the rescue of floundering GVA Property Management by coming in as a general partner in a\n$60 million recapitalization\nof 1,700 units in Nashville, Knoxville and Dallas. S2\nraised $343 million\nfor its second value-add fund over the summer and acquired industrial operator Fort Capital\u2019s 11 million-square-foot portfolio in August. Before the end of the year, S2 planted a flag in Chicago with its first purchase, 344-unit Ovaltine Court, for $93.7 million.\nBut, interest rates haven\u2019t fallen as those who pushed the \u201csurvive til \u201825\u201d maxim had hoped, and Everett\u2019s maneuver wasn\u2019t perfect.\nSome limited partners said they felt coerced into the conversion, and the portfolio still took a hit with the REIT launch, coming out to 93 cents on the dollar. Plus, the firm was still left to execute its value-add promise.\nThe same month that S2 closed its second value-add fund, the firm lost a property to foreclosure. It allegedly\ndefaulted on a $36 million mortgage\nfrom CBRE for the 290-unit Preslee Apartments, at 2504 Ivy Brook Court in Arlington.\nEverett launched S2 Capital in 2012. It has a portfolio of about 130 properties throughout the Sun Belt.

Property records showed a mortgage amount of $165 million.\nSavanna sold the building to Westbrook in 2015 for $310 million and then decided to reacquire it in 2020 for $435 million.\nAmerican Exchange is a fashion manufacturing company, but has been pursuing more real estate deals lately.\nShortly after closing on the acquisition of 1375 Broadway, Sentry and 60 Guilders purchased 1370 Broadway in Midtown South from Invesco Real Estate\nfor $75.5 million\n. Fortress Investment Group provided an acquisition loan of around 65 percent loan-to-cost.\nBain Capital, founded in 1984, has approximately $205 billion of assets under management. Ryan Cotton leads the company\u2019s real estate division.\nLast month, a joint venture of Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners announced that it\nclosed\na $1.6 billion fundraise, pushing their collective equity to invest in their open-air retail operating platform beyond $2 billion.\nElsewhere in Manhattan, Sovereign Partners recently\nsecured\na $150 million refinancing loan from Rialto Capital for the 20-story office building at 100 Fifth Avenue in Midtown South.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

She declined to comment.\nThe deal has yet to appear in public records, and the buyer is unknown.\nRichard Schaps is the founder of Van Wagner Group, one of the biggest firms focused on billboard and aerial advertising in the country.\nSchaps sold the billboard division of the company to CBS Outdoor for $690 million in 2014, and now focuses primarily on sports and entertainment advertising at events like the Super Bowl, Olympics, the Kentucky Derby, U.S. Open Tennis and college football playoffs. It specializes in in-stadium signage for brands that will be visible for television viewers.\nThe Schapses bought the waterfront home on Palm Beach\u2019s Everglades Island for $7.9 million in 2012, according to property records.

        "content": "Ian Schrager is approaching 80 years old, but he\u2019s still pursuing his dream of running a big company. Now, he\u2019s partnering with a major management firm to scale up Public Hotels.\nSchrager joined forces with Highgate to operate his Public brand, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The partners aim to acquire hotels or small hotel companies, develop properties and convert Highgate assets to the Public banner.\nHighgate, which owns or manages more than 400 properties across the world, won\u2019t be taking an ownership stake in Public. It will be involved in acquisitions and management contracts, though.\nThe hotelier is also dropping his usual pursuit of high-profile restaurant options for his properties, instead opting for fast-casual and takeout food to save on costs.\nDespite launching 15 years ago, Public has only a single hotel in operation, a property at 215 Chrystie Street in Manhattan. Public is talking with Danny Meyer to run a food and beverage service at the location, which was recently refinanced with a $310 million loan.\nThe hotel has been the site of a dispute between Schrager and Whole Foods Market. In July, Whole Foods sued the hotel, claiming the crowd for the trendy rooftop bar blocks overnight deliveries to its East Houston Street location by restricting access to its driveway and loading docks.\nAn entity tied to the hotel\nresponded\nby filing a summons against Whole Foods, seeking to stop its delivery trucks from parking \u201cin front or in the vicinity\u201d of the property.\nSchrager and Steve Witkoff opened the 28-story building in 2017, but were forced to close it after the onset of the pandemic. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2021, but by the next year, the developers had defaulted on their $189 million senior mortgage and faced a UCC foreclosure on their equity in the property, which the refinancing took care of.\nA second hotel is expected to open in West Hollywood in the spring, but that\u2019s still a far cry from the 15 locations Schrager expected to have up and running within seven years of the company\u2019s launch in 2011.\nSchrager rose to fame as a pioneer in the boutique hotel space and was a co-founder of Studio 54. He also helped develop Marriott\u2019s Edition lifestyle hotel brand, a partnership that ended in 2022.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "John Beyer, a preservationist, architect and last surviving co-founder of the firm Beyer Blinder Belle, died last Tuesday at his Manhattan home, the New York Times\nreported\n. He was 92.\nA representative from his eponymous firm confirmed his death. No cause of death was given.\nBeyer, Richard Blinder and John Belle founded the company in 1968 after breaking off from shopping mall pioneer Victor Gruen. The firm staked out a reputation for preserving New York City\u2019s history and adapting old properties into more contemporary uses.\nBorn on Feb. 13, 1933 in Hackensack, New Jersey, Beyer grew up in Teaneck. His father was a jeweler. Beyer studied at Denison University, receiving his degree in art in 1954 before pursuing a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in architecture at Harvard University, setting him on the course to define a generation of New York City buildings.\nHis firm\u2019s most notable work may have been the restoration of Grand Central Terminal, which it transformed from grungy to glamorous in 1998, cleaning layers of soot, adding a grand staircase and removing a billboard that obscured natural light.\nOther significant renovations included the Met Breuer building, the main New York Public Library property, the Frick Collection and the flagship Henri Bendel store, rebuilt into a Fifth Avenue rowhouse. The firm also operated in Washington, D.C.\nAfter 9/11, Beyer Blinder Belle was commissioned to develop site plans at the World Trade Center, which Beyer took the lead on. The design was deemed underwhelming and the firm was replaced by Studio Daniel Libeskind, but many of the guiding principles pitched by Beyer Blinder Belle ultimately remained.\nThe firm remained one of the city\u2019s\nactive developers\nin recent years and Beyer was a part of that, even after the passing of his co-founders; Blinder died in 2006, while Belle\ndied in 2016\n. The demise of Innovation QNS presented an opportunity for Beyer Blinder Belle, listed as the\narchitect\nof a 560-unit, 498,000-square-foot mixed-use building filed at 35-18 Steinway Street by BedRock and L+M.\nBeyer\u2019s passing comes less than two weeks after the death of his wife. He is survived by two children from his first marriage, three from his second marriage and nine grandchildren.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The suburban Chicago Lyons Township High School District 204 is one step closer to hiring a real estate broker to help sell a chunk of land it owns in Willow Springs, reviving a process that stalled years ago amid public backlash and concerns about backroom dealing.\nAt a board meeting last week, district officials signaled tentative support for MoHall Commercial and Urban Development, the lowest bidder among three firms vying for the assignment, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The broker would be tasked with valuing the property, marketing it broadly and identifying potential buyers, according to meeting discussions.\nThe district has been in possession of the roughly 70-acre\nundeveloped property\nfor many decades, having acquired it in anticipation of the possible need for an additional campus. According to the district\u2019s website, that need was determined unnecessary years ago due to enrollment projections. The district\u2019s Board of Education wants any profit from a sale to make investments in updating\ncampus facilities\n.\nThe district stopped short of approving a contract, citing unanswered reference checks. Chicago-based MoHall submitted three references as required under the bid request, but only one responded, with the others remaining silent despite repeated follow-ups. Superintendent Brian Waterman told the board he would push the firm to secure additional responses or provide new references before any agreement is finalized. The board expects to make a decision in February.\nMoHall\u2019s proposal came in at $45,000, with no set timeline. CBRE submitted a $90,000 bid tied to a six-month engagement, while Oak Terrace-based\nNAI Hiffman\nproposed a yearlong assignment for $120,000, the publication reported. Board members acknowledged the cost gap, but emphasized that credibility and process would outweigh price alone.\nTransparency has been a recurring theme. Roughly three years ago, the district faced intense opposition after residents learned of quiet talks about a potential sale to an industrial buyer. That episode derailed negotiations and left the land in limbo, according to the outlet. The district rejected two bids from industrial buyers at the time, the highest a $55 million bid from Chicago-based\nBridge Industrial\n, the community newspaper Riverside-Brookfield Landmark\nreported\nat the time. Board members said they intend to work closely with the Willow Springs community and keep discussions in the open this time.\nBoard member Kari Dillon said at the meeting that the selected broker should go beyond passive marketing, listing the property on a multiple listing service and proactively reaching buyers who may not be aware of the site. Vice President Jill Beda Daniels added that the broker will be expected to analyze market conditions and pricing trends, even if that means advising the district to wait.\nStill, the district is feeling financial pressure. Aging facilities require costly repairs and upgrades, and officials made clear that a land sale could provide much-needed capital. No estimate yet exists for the property\u2019s value, nor a timeline for a deal. The board\u2019s next meeting is scheduled for Feb. 2, when members could move closer to greenlighting a broker.\n\u201cWe just need to get it marketed and not spend more money to decide if we\u2019re going to do it or not,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWe\u2019re at that point now where we do need some money.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The full-floor primary suite has a fireplace and dual walk-in closets, while the garden level has another guest suite.\nThe private backyard has a sauna and cold plunge.\nThe second priciest contract signed last week was for a Carroll Gardens townhouse at 16 2nd Street asking $5.5 million.\nThe home spent just 14 days on the market, a seeming testament to over two decades of tweaks and renovations that seller, architect James Biber, had undertaken since 2002.\nBiber and his late wife Carin Goldberg, known for designing Madonna\u2019s debut album cover, gut renovated the house, which Biber described as \u201ckind of a wreck\u201d in an interview with\nRobb Report\nabout the work.\nLater, they converted the top floor to an open-plan living space and updated the facade and landscaping of the front and rear gardens. Two more rounds of refreshes took place in 2020 and 2025. \u201cIt is now as nearly perfect as it can be,\u201d Biber said.\nThe work kept intact much of the home\u2019s 1875 character, including pine hardwood floors, window moldings, plaster work and a central staircase, while air rights mean the future owner can expand even further on Biber\u2019s work.\nCorcoran\u2019s Dana Power and Falcon Griffith had the listing.\nThe homes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $3.3 million, spent an average of 181 days on the market and had an average discount of 3 percent.\n",

        "content": "Boxer Oscar De La Hoya defaulted on a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to an office building in downtown Los Angeles that his company owns and occupies. De La Hoya owes about $23 million and faces foreclosure on the property, according to the notice of default and election to sell dated late last year.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthat the debt landed in special serving after missing a July maturity date. The latest servicer commentary, via Morningstar Credit, notes that the borrower is seeking a loan modification and extension of the maturity date \u2014 and the lender will continue discussions but has called a lawyer.\nThe 12-story, roughly 150,000-square-foot property at 626 Wilshire Boulevard, located in the Financial District, was only 60 percent occupied, according to servicer commentary, as of last summer.\nDowntown offices\n, which have become the poster-child for post-pandemic distress,\u00a0 had a 34.4 percent vacancy rate, as of the fourth quarter last year, per a CBRE report.\nDe La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy Promotions \u2014 so called for the former boxer, who was nicknamed \u201cThe Golden Boy of Boxing\u201d after he won an Olympic gold medal \u2014 occupies 7 percent of the space, or around 10,500 square feet, and is the second largest tenant in the building. De La Hoya founded the company and is its chief executive and chair.\nDe La Hoya and the\nlate\nBarker Pacific Group founder, Michael Barker, are the named loan sponsors, per Morningstar. The debt originated more than a decade ago, and the value of the property has plummeted since. In 2015, the mid-rise office building on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Hope Street was worth $40 million \u2014 its 2025 appraisal put its value at $19 million.\nThe Los Angeles Times, in 2004,\nreported\nDe La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy purchased a controlling interest in the property for $16 million from Barker Pacific Group, which kept a minority share; Christopher Rising of Rising Realty Partners also purchased a minority share. The property was more than 80 percent leased then.\nBarker Pacific Group still appears to hold ownership, though Rising\u2019s involvement is unclear. The borrower and owner entity, via recent business records, is connected to De La Hoya and Barker Pacific Group (one document signed by Barker himself and another by managing principal Mark Handin). De La Hoya signed the 2015 loan documents.\nGolden Boy Promotions representatives, Handin and Rising did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

The entity, CG Miami River, allegedly failed to make the payment last month as required by a settlement agreement, the Jan. 13 complaint states.\nKarp, his lawyer Alex Barthet and the Chetrits did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Karp-designed project was recently rebranded as\nFlow on the Miami River\nafter Neumann\u2019s Miami-based real estate firm, called\nFlow\n, partnered with Canada Global and Yakir Gabay\u2019s Yellowstone Trust to acquire a majority stake in the project in August from New York-based Chetrit Group.\nNeumann and partners provided a $525 million recapitalization.\nMeanwhile, CG Miami River modified a\n$310 million\nconstruction loan with Madison Realty Capital, increasing the mortgage by $9.5 million, records show.\nKarp withdrew a lien placed on the property in August so the Chetrits could close on the refinancing, under the terms of a settlement agreement to pay nearly $1 million in owed architecture fees, the lawsuit states.\nKarp\u2019s lawsuit alleges CG Miami River paid $300,000 when the loan closed but failed to pay the balance by a Dec. 9 deadline. The Chetrits signed as guarantors, per the complaint.\nKarp\u2019s lawsuit is the latest legal wrinkle around a\nMiami River site\nthat Chetrit has been trying to redevelop for more than a decade. The 4-million-square-foot project could eventually include up to 1,900 apartments and condos, 39,000 square feet of retail, office space, a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces.\nThe first phase, a 54-story tower with 632 apartments at 275 Southwest Sixth Street, is nearly completed. The project includes at least two other residential high-rises. Flow is managing the first tower and will lead development of the rest of the project as managing member of the majority ownership. The Chetrits retained a minority interest.",

Of the 456 units, 46 would be designated for rent at below-market rates, allowing developer Trammell Crow to take advantage of density bonus incentives allowing a taller structure with more units than zoning rules would typically allow. The ground floor would have 6,200 square feet of commercial space.\nParking for 668 vehicles would be included on site. Amenities planned for the residential complex north of\nSanta Monica Airport\ninclude a fitness center, lounge spaces, outdoor courtyards and roof decks.\nThe project is being designed by AC Martin. Renderings for the project indicate some residences would have recessed balconies and roof decks integrated into residences on the upper levels.\nUnder the City of Santa Monica\u2019s housing element, officials must plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029; of those, 69 percent must be at various affordable income levels. To meet that goal, the city has been approving developers\u2019 affordable housing plans or looking to sell land to willing builders who vow to construct affordable units. Last year, the city sought developers to build affordable housing on three city-owned properties as the city works to comply with California\u2019s Surplus Land Act.\nIn September, the city\nadvanced an eight-story residential project\nat 1907-1933 Wilshire Boulevard set to contain 260 units, including 26 set aside for affordable housing. The developer for that project is U.S. 1931 Wilshire Owner LLC, linked by address in state business records to\nCypress Equity Investments\n. Cypress is also looking to\nreplace a former Honda dealership\nat 1801 and 1819 Santa Monica Boulevard with a 288-unit apartment complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A proposed Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center outside Dallas is starting to look less hypothetical and more like a very real industrial real estate move with possible civic consequences.\nThe Washington Post first reported in December that ICE was planning a roughly 1-million-square-foot detention center in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas \u2014 capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland. The plan immediately rattled the city of fewer than 8,000 residents, whose mayor said publicly he did not want the project and noted only one warehouse in town is large enough to fit the bill, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nUntil now, neither\nICE\nnor any media outlet had identified a specific site or owner. But local clergy groups and community leaders say the location is an open secret.\nOn Friday, members of the Clergy League for Emergency Action and Response gathered in Dallas to protest the proposed center, saying ICE officials had privately confirmed the location to some members. The\nfacility\n, they said, is a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, the outlet reported. A Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nPublic records list the owner as PS Hutchins Phase Two, a Delaware entity registered through an agent. Calls to the property listing went to the voicemail of a\nMajestic Realty\nsenior vice president. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon, echoing Mayor Mario Vasquez\u2019s description of the only viable site in town.\nClergy members said ICE already conducted a site visit and\npurchased the building\nrather than leasing it, though the agency has not confirmed a transaction or even acknowledged a specific address. A title commitment dated last week for the property was shared with reporters, adding fuel to the speculation.\nThe real estate implications extend beyond the building itself. Bond documents from Hutchins show the property is among the city\u2019s top 10 taxpayers, accounting for about 3.8 percent of its tax base and generating roughly $1.8 million a year, according to the outlet. If ICE owns the facility, that revenue could disappear, complicating the city\u2019s ability to service debt. Infrastructure is another concern. Local leaders warn Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A hefty tax bill is coming due for Jeff Winick as his fall from the perch of his brokerage firm continues.\nA bankruptcy judge ordered the Winick Realty Group founder to pay approximately $9 million to the Internal Revenue Service for income tax he failed to pay between 2012 and 2016, Bisnow\nreported\n. The judge declared Winick\u2019s tax filings for those years an \u201coutright fabrication,\u201d though he was credited for paying $2 million in taxes from 2014 to 2020.\nThe bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision was reported first by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe ruling was years in the making. The IRS sued Winick in 2020, shortly after he filed for bankruptcy claiming $10 million in liabilities against only $500,000 in assets. The IRS alleged Winick was living it up and fraudulently transferring assets while ducking his income tax responsibilities.\nIn his defense, Winick pointed towards a gambling addiction, which cost him more than $12 million in the years prior to his bankruptcy. He also claimed he planned to pay his taxes with big business or gambling gains that failed to materialize.\nThe judge balked at his argument, pointing to years where Winick managed to gamble, pay taxes and still have the money for international trips, exorbitant rentals and family shopping sprees.\nWinick also allegedly transferred business and property shares to his daughter for no consideration, which the IRS alleged was likely a method to dodge taxes.\nWinick ultimately was\nforced to sell\na stake in his brokerage several years ago. Steven Baker, now chief executive officer, teamed up with colleagues Louis Eisinger and Lee Block to\npurchase a majority stake\nin the company in 2021.\nThe insiders scored a 63 percent stake after being selected as stalking horse bidders, a controversial proceeding due to the alleged involvement of Winick\u2019s daughter in the bid.\nLast year, Winick Realty Group\nrebranded\nas RTL, a name designed to reflect a focus on the retail industry. Winick remains an active dealmaker and has been listed as an exclusive agent on many of the brokerage\u2019s listings, continuing with RTL as an associate broker.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A 10-acre-plus waterfront resort and marina in the Florida Keys that once hosted actor Paul Newman and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson is listed for sale for $45 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nSugarloaf Lodge &amp; Marina, near mile marker 17, consists of 31 hotel rooms and commercial space. The site at 17001 Overseas Highway comes with development rights to rebuild 24 hotel keys lost in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, according to listing broker Lisa Swanson.\nSwanson, of The Agency Florida Keys, is listing the property with Jamie Bederak, of The Agency Miami.\nThe asking price amounts to $1.45 million per hotel key.\nSugarloaf Lodge was built in the late 1950s by the Pennsylvania strip mining company that dredged and developed much of Sugarloaf Key. Additions were built in the 1960s. In 1973, husband-and-wife Lloyd and Miriam Good bought the property and moved to Sugarloaf Key to run the resort with their four children.\nThe property is now owned by entity Miriam BG, led by John Good and Caren Ward, children of the late Lloyd and Miriam Good. The entity also is led by Jessica Duncan Wex and Katchen Elizabeth Duncan, John Good\u2019s nieces.\nSugarloaf spans nearly 10.6 acres and includes a 12,700-square-foot hotel and a 5,300-square-foot restaurant leased to South of the Seven, plus a tiki bar and events venue. It includes office space, some of it leased to kayak and boat rental firms and a solar energy company, and it also has an apartment, marinas, a pool and tennis courts, according to Swanson and John Good.\nThe owners have preserved much of the property\u2019s original look, including Mid-Century Modern decor in the hotel rooms.\nThe property can be entirely redeveloped, though it would mean bigger setbacks from the bay, especially for the restaurant that now juts into the water atop stilts, due to changes in construction regulations. The development potential for 24 hotel keys is legally vested with the property.\nMonroe County caps heights to 38 feet, with officials considering legislation to increase this to 42 feet for residential uses.\nGood, who grew up on the property and hosted the 5 p.m. daily dolphins shows, recalled some of its history.\nDolly, a \u201cvery smart\u201d dolphin that escaped the U.S. Navy was a common visitor when the Good family arrived at Sugarloaf Lodge. The Goods removed any nets keeping her within the bay, and Dolly eventually swam away, as she wasn\u2019t too keen on doing the shows, Good said.\nJacques Cousteau had studied Dolly for her intelligence and featured her in one of his books. Sugar, the other bottlenose dolphin there, enjoyed performing, sticking around until her death in 1997, Good said.\nNewman was fun to talk with, Good said, and imparted some insight on his alma mater Kenyon College, where Good was headed at the time. Thompson \u201cwas kind of part of our family for a couple of years,\u201d Good said. A pig prank involving Thomson and Lloyd Good made it into Thomspon\u2019s \u201cSongs of the Doomed.\u201d\n\u201cCrazy times,\u201d John Good said. \u201cIt was the \u201970s and \u201980s \u2026 a lot of characters.\u201d\nThe Florida Keys are quieter than bustling Miami to the north, though the Keys also attracted some investment during South Florida\u2019s commercial and residential real estate boom of recent years.\nIn Islamorada, Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy bought the 1.7-acre waterfront mansion at 76180 Overseas Highway for\n$27.8 million\nin October.\nAlso in Islamorada, Frisbie Group sold the Islands of Islamorada resort consisting of 22 villas and an eight-key hotel for\n$72 million\nin 2024. Buyer Wills Companies launched\nsales\nof the villas last year.\nIn 2023, The Ardid family\u2019s Brickell-based Key International paid more than\n$37.6 million\nfor the 100-key Perry Hotel at 7001 Shrimp Road in Key West, and Miami-based Integra Investments paid about $29.7 million for the adjacent 288-slip, 35-acre Perry Marina at 7005 Shrimp Road.\n",

        "content": "Perot Jain is officially moving into Dallas\u2019 most rarefied office address \u2014 at Harlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland campus.\nThe venture capital firm co-founded by Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain opened a 4,200-square-foot office in Providence Hall, part of the newly built Old Parkland East campus, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The move places the firm inside the latest expansion of the historic\nOld Parkland\ncomplex, a\nJeffersonian-style enclave\nthat has become home to some of North Texas\u2019 wealthiest family offices, law firms, private equity shops and foundations.\nPerot Jain will consolidate its five-person team in the new space, while maintaining space at\nHillwood\nand the Perot Companies\u2019 Turtle Creek headquarters. The office marks a step forward for the firm, which launched in 2014 and has quietly built a portfolio of roughly 70 companies across logistics, mobility, industrial, defense and sports.\nThe deal comes as Crow Holdings continues to fill out Old Parkland East, a three-building expansion that added about 285,000 square feet to the campus, according to the publication. Bill Brokaw of Hillwood Urban represented Perot Jain in lease talks, while HPI Real Estate Services\u2019 Ben Cuzen handled the deal for Old Parkland.\nPerot Jain partner Aaron Pierce told the outlet that the draw was less about square footage than proximity. Old Parkland\u2019s tight-knit tenant roster has long functioned as an informal deal marketplace, where chance hallway conversations often lead to co-investments. Pierce previously worked on campus before joining Perot Jain and said the collaborative culture remains a differentiator.\nJain sold a majority stake in Access Healthcare to New Mountain Capital in January 2025 in a deal Bloomberg reported to be valued at $2 billion. That firm was later rolled into Smarter Technologies in a reported $6 billion combination, freeing Jain to focus more heavily on venture investing and his family office, which will also operate out of the\nOld Parkland\nspace.\nPerot Jain\u2019s focus is often on early-stage companies generating less than $1 million to a few million dollars in revenue. Its bets range from AI and cyber-defense firm Rilian to Casimir, a startup working on next-generation power technology, along with a stake in the Texas Super Kings cricket team, according to the Business Journal.\nThe move also highlights Old Parkland\u2019s continued appeal as Dallas\u2019 unofficial capital of private capital. While many office landlords are still fighting vacancies, the campus has leaned into exclusivity, curated tenancy and expansion.\nPierce, who also chairs nonprofit Venture Dallas, told the outlet that he sees the firm\u2019s new home as aligned with a broader regional push. Dallas-Fort Worth companies attracted more than $2 billion in venture funding across 222 deals in 2025, up sharply from the prior year, according to PitchBook-NVCA data.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Hines previously acquired the five-building office and industrial complex in 2018 for $115 million. The property totals 576,234 square feet across nearly 34 acres.\nLast month, Brea city leaders agreed to a 50-year sales tax rebate with Dwight Manley if he executes a lease with Costco as officials\nhoped\nto bring the big-box store to the city, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Brea City Council voted to give Manley a year to bring Costco to Brea once his acquisition of the 34-acre property was complete.\nUnder the agreement, Manley will receive a 100 percent rebate of the sales tax revenue generated by a future Costco location in the first two years. Over the course of the 50-year deal, the city would collect 42.5 percent of the sales tax. The deal works out to approximately $50 million in sales tax for the city and $83.5 million reimbursed to Manley. \u201cThis is the skinniest developer deal I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d Manley told the city council of the agreement at the time.\n\u201cCostco does not enter into agreements with cities,\u201d Manley said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the property owner. They\u2019ve had property owners do this in many instances where cities participated because they wanted a Costco.\u201d\nWhile Manley was negotiating with Hines, other bidders were interested in purchasing the site for other purposes, including an Amazon warehouse or high-density housing.\nCostco is in the process of growing its presence in Orange County.\nLast year, the wholesaler\nacquired two sites\nin Mission Viejo and Lake Forest in two separate deals to build new Costco locations. In Mission Viejo, Costco bought a former\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nat 25732 El Paseo for $14.4 million with plans to tear down the building and build a new fueling station with 40 pumps spanning more than 17,000 square feet next to I-405. In\nLake Forest\n\u2019s Foothill Ranch neighborhood, Costco picked up the defunct Regal Cinema at Foothill Ranch Towne Center for $12.5 million and is looking to replace it with a 160,811-square-foot store.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eli Karp is suing the lender and appraiser of his foreclosed Hello Lenox apartment building, alleging they intentionally overvalued the Brooklyn property.\nKarp is accusing a Greystone affiliate and real estate valuation firm BBG of engineering a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme that he says cost him his flagship property, per a lawsuit filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court. Karp alleges that Greystone, led by founder and CEO Stephen Rosenberg, conspired with BBG to dramatically inflate the value of his newly-built apartment complex at 271 Lenox Road in East Flatbush.\nThe inflated valuation, the suit claims, was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan that ultimately set the stage for a foreclosure. According to the complaint, BBG appraisers valued the 55-unit property at $46.2 million in 2019, an appraisal Greystone allegedly commissioned and paid for. Relying on that figure, Karp personally guaranteed the loan, which was intended to refinance construction debt and buy him time to sell the building, the suit alleges.\nAs the loan\u2019s maturity approached, Karp couldn\u2019t refinance the debt and defaulted, the suit says. Adding fuel to the allegations, BBG issued a second appraisal in 2024 valuing the same property at $29.6 million, a $16.6 million drop from the 2019 figure. Karp claims in the suit that the swing can\u2019t be explained by market conditions alone and instead proves the earlier appraisal was fraudulently inflated.\nThe property was ultimately sold at a foreclosure auction for $10 million to the Greystone affiliate. Karp is now on the hook for a $15 million personal guarantee.\n\u201cAll of this stems from a fraudulent appraisal and a loan that never should have been entered into,\u201d Karp\u2019s attorney Muriel Raggi said.\nKarp is seeking at least $16.6 million in damages tied to the alleged appraisal inflation, along with $122 million against Greystone and Rosenberg, alleging they cost him other opportunities by locking him into an exclusive loan letter of intent on other properties in his portfolio.\nRepresentatives for Greystone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BBG declined to comment, saying they had not yet seen the suit.\nOnce a rising Brooklyn developer known for his sleek, \u201cHello\u201d-branded luxury rentals, Karp saw his empire unravel after his projects fell into distress. He has blamed Madison Realty Capital for buying his debt and piling on default interest (a charge the firm disputes) as foreclosures and bankruptcies swept through his portfolio.\n",

        "content": "\u201cNews\u201d is something important that happens. It can also be something that doesn\u2019t.\nIf Mayor Zohran Mamdani does not attempt to get the City Council to override Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, that would be news.\nI say this because Mamdani has been a big proponent of COPA and its equivalent bill in Albany, TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act). The bills, heavily opposed by the real estate industry, would\nstall sales\nof multifamily buildings for months to give tenants and nonprofits a better chance to buy them.\nAt this writing, Mamdani is just a few votes away from getting it enacted by the City Council. COPA passed with 30 votes and needs 34 to override the veto. (\nEleven\nof the Council\u2019s 51 members took office after the initial vote.)\nIn theory, it should not be hard for a popular new mayor coming off a resounding election victory \u2014 and a successful handling of his first blizzard \u2014 to flip a few votes in the 51-member Council.\nBut Mamdani has a lot of reasons not to even try on COPA.\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to big-foot new Council Speaker Julie Menin in the first month of their tenures. He just\npatched up their relationship\nand is going to need her for the next four years. Menin abstained from December\u2019s COPA vote and doesn\u2019t seem at all motivated to marshal votes to override the veto.\nSecond, Mamdani\u2019s base, including the Democratic Socialists of America, does not seem to be pushing for him to override the veto \u2014 even though COPA has been a DSA dream for some time.\nDSA often advocates for ideological bills, but has enough sense not to demand that its handful of elected members fall on their swords in an effort to pass them.\nThird, there\u2019s a racial and religious dynamic of which Mamdani must be very mindful: City Council member Darlene Mealy rounded up opposition to COPA by arguing it would be unfair to\nBlack and Jewish landlords\n. That\u2019s in large part why it fell short of a 34-vote \u201cveto-proof\u201d majority.\nMamdani\u2019s issues with conservative Jews have been well documented and he has been criticized for not naming any Black deputy mayors. \u201cIt has become a problem,\u201d a New York Times headline\ndeclared\n.\nHis failure to appoint a single Black deputy mayor came despite his desire to shore up support in heavily Black areas, where he got only 29 percent of the Democratic primary vote last June. This would not be a good time for him to anger Black and Jewish landlords, who are already furious about his call for a four-year freeze on stabilized rents and his pending\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\n.\nFourth, if he tries to override the veto and fails, that would show political weakness, especially after he tried and failed to stop Menin from becoming speaker. The optics of a second defeat in two months would be bad, and it would make it harder for him to win other battles.\nFor those reasons, it looks like my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\u2019s\nstory\nMonday was spot on: COPA is DOA.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI misunderstood a sentence in a\nTRD story\nto mean that Summit Properties is raising money on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for its purchase of the Pinnacle portfolio. That is not the case, according to a Summit spokesperson. The TASE disclosures it filed about the Pinnacle deal were to provide transparency for potential investors in an unrelated Summit investment.\nI was\ntrying to estimate\nSummit\u2019s potential return on investment for the Pinnacle acquisition. To do that, one would divide its annual profit by the $112.8 million it is contributing to the $451.3 million purchase. My rough calculation comes to 11 percent. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many apartment leases in Germany require tenants to open their windows several times a day, \u201ceven \u2014 or especially \u2014 in winter,\u201d the Washington Post\nreported\nin a story about the practice, called l\u00fcften. \u201cGerman courts have ruled that, absent specific landlord guidance, a tenant is required to open windows twice a day, morning and evening, for 10 minutes each.\u201d Via TikTok, the practice has spread to America, where it\u2019s called \u201chouse burping.\u201d\nElsewhere\u2026\nQueens Borough President Donovan Richards, perhaps the most pro-housing elected official in the city, told\nGothamist\nthat if a City Council member asks him to sustain the Council\u2019s rejection of new housing, \u201cthere has to be a scientific reason why either you\u2019re going to kill the project or have a substantial reduction in the unit counts.\u201d\nRichards and the other borough presidents have\nbecome relevant\nin land-use approvals again by virtue of a\nCity Charter revision\npassed by voters in November.\nRichards knows that when NIMBYs oppose a project or rezoning, their rationale is less scientific than emotional (fear of change) or financial (keeping housing scarce increases their homes\u2019 value).\nThey do often present a scientific reason, but not based on any data, such as \u201cthe sewer system cannot handle it\u201d or \u201cthe streets will be gridlocked.\u201d Which makes it pseudo-science. Richards has undoubtedly noticed that ordinary citizens suddenly become infrastructure experts when faced with the prospect of new neighbors.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$24.3 million\nfor a 4,997-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 20 East 76th Street on the Upper East Side.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$8 million\nfor a 17-unit apartment building at 44 Perry Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$10 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 820 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Daniella G. Schlisser, Justin J. Pak and Gigi Ozdemir with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,127-square-foot, 79-unit residential building at 9528 147th Place in Jamaica. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Herman Jacob.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The nearly 5,000-square-foot pad sold to\nUptown Fun, LLC\nfor $24.3 million, the unit\u2019s asking price. It has three bedrooms, four and a half baths and a terrace.

However, Cobble Hill\u2019s average of about $2.9 million was about 5 percent lower than its average of $3.1 million the year before.\nNeighborhoods closer to Manhattan dominated the top 100 home sales in Brooklyn last year.

        "content": "PMG and Lndmrk Development are launching a Frida Kahlo-branded short-term rental-friendly condominium in Miami\u2019s Wynwood, their latest partnership in the neighborhood.\nThe likeness of the famed Mexican communist will decorate one of the luxury project\u2019s facades, renderings show. The developers are planning the 244-unit Frida Kahlo Wynwood Residences for the 1-acre site at 119 Northwest 29th Street, which they bought for\n$20 million\nin 2023, according to property records.\nThey tapped Uruguayan-Canadian architect Carlos Ott, Cube 3, and Cotofana Designs to design the complex, according to a news release. It will span two buildings, with an eight-story north tower and a 14-story south tower, a spokesperson confirmed. Units will range from studios to three-bedrooms and come fully furnished.\nThe condo\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, a fitness center, spa facilities and a lobby lounge, the release shows. Prices for the units start at $500,000 and range up to $1.6 million, the spokesperson confirmed. PMG will lead sales in-house for the project.\nThe developers are also partnering with Baker Health, a New York-based concierge medicine service, to open its first Florida location on the ground floor of the project. Residents will receive a free membership to the service for one year, the release shows.\nThe late Frida Kahlo is one of the most famous women artists in the world, and her paintings are among the most valuable. Her 1940 painting \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d sold for a record $55 million at Sotheby\u2019s in November, making it the most expensive piece ever sold at auction by a woman artist. The record for men is held by Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d which sold for $450.3 million in 2017.\nWhile the November auction sale was notable for its price, it was also remarkable as Kahlo\u2019s paintings are rarely available for purchase.\nHer husband, Diego Rivera, bequeathed the couple\u2019s works to the people of Mexico, and the Bank of Mexico owns and manages their trust and estate.\nThat her name and likeness can be licensed for condo branding purposes is the result of her niece Isolda Pineda Kahlo\u2019s 2004 partnership with ItalBank president Carlos Dorado. The pair created the Frida Kahlo Corporation and trademarked the artist\u2019s name, face and signature.\nSince Pineda Kahlo\u2019s death in 2007, the corporation has come into conflict with her daughter, who sued in 2019 over the creation of a Frida Kahlo Barbie.\nThe branding agreement between the Frida Kahlo Corporation, PMG and Lndmrk is an example of one of South Florida\u2019s busiest new development categories: branded residences.\nThousands of units are planned or in development across the region bearing familiar logos from\nfashion houses\n,\nhospitality empires\n,\nhypercar makers\n,\nrestaurant groups\nand\nmagazines\n. Developers see brands as a way to signal expectations of prestige and hospitality service to buyers, and a way to differentiate projects in a crowded marketplace.\nThat said, industry leaders have also advised caution on brand selection.\n\u201cNot all brands are created equal,\u201d Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\n2024 Miami Forum\n.\nPMG and Lndmrk opted out of branding for their other Wynwood condo project. Miami-based PMG, led by Ryan Shear, Dan Kaplan and Kevin Maloney, and Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Miami-based Lndmrk launched sales for the 233-unit short-term rental-friendly\nTwenty Sixth &amp; 2nd Wynwood Residences\nin April, with prices for studios starting at $500,000.\n",

        "content": "Real estate remained upbeat on a\nproposed ballot measure\nto amend the so-called\nmansion tax\neven as the Los Angeles City Council told one of its most prominent members to slow her rollback.\nA fiery debate ensued during Tuesday\u2019s Los Angeles City Council meeting over the fast-tracking of a proposed 15-year carveout of the Measure United to House L.A. tax for new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use developments, in addition to an exemption for property owners impacted by a natural disaster.\nCurrently, ULA applies a 4 percent property transfer tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe request to draft a ballot measure for June was made Friday by progressive councilwoman Nithya Raman, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who became a leader of the progressive wing of the council in part for her role as an early a proponent of Measure ULA\u2019s stated mission of\nfunding homelessness and affordable housing programs\n.\nRaman said the amendments would fix the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the two-tier tax, noting that ULA \u201cwas sold to voters as a mansion tax\u201d but also applies to other segments of\u00a0 real estate and has cast a pall over dealmaking and development of apartments and commercial projects.\nShe told her colleagues on the 15-seat council that it has essentially placed \u201ca transfer tax on all properties over $5 million, including apartments and we have to be honest about what has happened as a result.\u201d\nThe biggest takeaway of Raman\u2019s proposal would be a permanent, 15-year carveout seen as an incentive for new construction of multifamily properties of at least four units. It would also apply to commercial projects, defined as anything that doesn\u2019t have residential. It\u2019s the first major proposal aimed at addressing Measure ULA\u2019s effect on the multifamily and commercial segments.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, hailed Raman\u2019s motion as a \u201chuge move forward\u201d and the result of several months of negotiations between government officials, the business community, real estate interests and non-profits looking at ways of fixing the tax.\nSome of Raman\u2019s peers lashed out at the lack of public debate over the proposal.\nThat included 7th District representative Monica Rodriguez, who took Raman to task for the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d used to prompt ULA during a citywide campaign in 2022, accusing her colleague of selling the tax to voters without any studies.\n\u201cWe knew that these were the implications \u2026 when we were having these conversations around ULA and we\u2019ve been calling it out for, oh, well over a year, but it was convenient to ignore it when the money was being doled out to different initiatives that people wanted to support,\u201d Rodriguez told Raman during Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\nRaman\u2019s colleagues on Tuesday kicked her proposal for a ballot measure on the proposed carveouts to the Housing and Homelessness Committee rather than holding a vote of the full council.\nMore recent attempts to amend ULA have largely been spurred by Palisades\nFire-impacted property owners\n. Those concerns are also addressed in Raman\u2019s proposal with a one-time, three-year exemption in cases of natural disasters that would be retroactive to January of last year.\nMeanwhile, there are language changes as it relates to existing affordable housing exemptions.\nBaby steps\nEven with what\u2019s on the table, real estate says there could be more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good step in the right direction,\u201d Cityview\u2019s Burton said of the proposed changes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not going as far as many in the city would like and many real estate interests would like.\u201d\nStill, the CEO said a full repeal of the tax isn\u2019t practical and Raman\u2019s proposal will \u201ckickstart the building of housing again.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen construction fall off a cliff for any sort of market rate housing or affordable housing,\u201d Burton said of the market since the tax went into effect. \u201cL.A.\u2019s been redlined by the investment community because of ULA. It makes investing in L.A. non-economic. I think the mayor realizes that and the councilwoman realizes that. I give her credit for having the guts to push this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad policy to begin with,\u201d Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, said of ULA. \u201cBut, setting that aside, [the proposal\u2019s] better than nothing. Treating multifamily and commercial with the same thresholds was absurd from the start. Better than nothing, not near enough, is what I would say.\u201d\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman agreed.\n\u201cAny policy that encourages development and acknowledges the economic realities facing builders and property owners is a positive step,\u201d Kirman said.\nThe luxury residential agent hailed the natural disaster exemptions but noted \u201cthere is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum.\u201d\nMott Smith, an adjunct professor of real estate at the University of Southern California Price School and chair of the Council of Infill Builders, offered a blunt assessment of what ULA is and has been for the market.\n\u201cThe only word I know for this is clusterfuck,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a mess.\u201d\nFrom Smith\u2019s view, the tax is \u201cfailing on all fronts\u201d except for the fact that it is indeed raising money, albeit at a lower rate than what was first estimated to taxpayers.\n\u201cWhat it is not doing effectively is funding affordable housing and this is because ULA is a ballot box version 1.0 that became law and the people that wrote it wrote it with a high degree of specificity and rigidity about how the money gets spent,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRushed\u201d process\nOpposition to the proposed amendments say the changes give in to real estate interests and stymie a revenue source that is upholding its promise to voters.\nThe Measure United to House coalition \u2014 a group of nonprofits, labor unions, affordable housing builders, homeless service providers and other supporters of the tax \u2014 said ULA revenue has been pumped into 795 affordable homes and provided rental or other assistance to 10,000 people in the city.\nThe coalition\u2019s director Joe Donlin called the proposed amendments \u201crushed\u201d and sided with the councilmembers who said it lacks any formal public discussion.\n\u201cThis is really a conversation about something that\u2019s really working for the city,\u201d Donlin said.\nCritics of the tax say otherwise and point to the $1 billion-metric that is touted by supporters. Since April 2023, when the tax went into effect, it has generated a little over $1 billion. The text of the measure that went before voters estimated the tax would generate anywhere from $600 million to $1.1 billion annually.\nDonlin also disputed any claims that the real estate market has been hindered by ULA.\n\u201cThe real estate market in L.A., just like real estate markets all around the country, have been deeply impacted by big, macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and inflating insurance premiums and higher construction costs,\u201d Donlin said. \u201cAnd, yet, we also have seen at each stage of the development process there are signs that L.A.\u2019s real estate market is trending in an upward direction.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In what is shaping into a recent Chicagoland trend, a proposed $2 billion data center in\nBarrington Hills\nis officially dead, the latest sign that suburban Chicago\u2019s once-red-hot data center pipeline is running into organized resistance.\nVillage officials announced that Chicago-based Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposal for a massive data center campus planned south of Penny Road and west of Pond Gate Drive. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the developer canceled a scheduled public presentation before the village\u2019s plan commission slated for Feb. 2 after what officials described as negative early feedback.\n\u201cAt this time, the village considers this matter closed and does not anticipate any further discussion,\u201d a village spokesperson said in a Facebook post announcing the withdrawal. The special meeting was canceled.\nDetails on the project were limited, but the scale alone set off alarm bells in the rural enclave known for its large estates and conservation-focused zoning. Opposition quickly mobilized, according to the outlet. A Change.org\npetition\nurging officials to reject the development had collected more than 1,300 signatures as of Tuesday, citing concerns about air pollution, water quality and long-term tax impacts.\n\u201cWe cannot allow this proposal to compromise the very essence of what makes Barrington Hills a special place,\u201d the petition stated.\nBrennan, which has been active in data centers, is the developer of similar projects in\nElk Grove Village\nand Rolling Meadows, according to public records. The firm did not publicly comment on its decision to pull the Barrington Hills proposal.\nThe retreat highlights how quickly the political calculus around data centers has shifted. For years, the facilities were the quiet darlings of municipal finance, with massive capital investment, limited traffic and steady property tax revenue. Approvals were\noften routine\n, as previously chronicled in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat era appears to be ending, at least in parts of suburban Chicago.\nJust last week, Lisle officials\npaused a proposed data center\nafter residents packed Village Hall with objections. In Naperville, the City Council rejected Karis Critical\u2019s data center proposal in a 6-1 vote following months of neighborhood opposition. Aurora, meanwhile, enacted a 180-day\nmoratorium\nin September to revisit its data center regulations, signaling broader unease with the facilities.\nThe local backlash comes even as the regional data center boom continues to\nsurge\n. In northwest Indiana, Amazon is planning multiple data center campuses with total investment that could exceed $15 billion, including a confirmed site in Hobart. Farther north, T5 Data Centers has spent more than $60 million assembling land in\nGrayslake\n, a project that has already required significant power commitments from ComEd and drawn scrutiny over its proximity to homes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Latin School of Chicago is heading for the exits on four historic\nNear North Side\nhomes it scooped up just four years ago, preparing to sell the properties at an estimated $2 million loss.\nThe private school is marketing four buildings on the 1500 block of North Dearborn Street that it bought in spring 2022 for just over $10 million,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The combined asking price for all four is about $8.1 million, with two already listed and two more expected to hit the market shortly.\nLatin acquired the homes in three deals as part of a long-term vision to expand and improve facilities for its lower school, serving students from junior kindergarten through fourth grade. But plans changed. In a letter sent to the school community in November and shared with the publication, board leaders said a subsequent multimillion-dollar upgrade to the existing lower school building eliminated the need for the Dearborn properties.\nThe letter also cited the disruption that a major construction project would cause, noting that redevelopment of the four buildings would likely require years of relocation for students and staff. The school declined to comment on the decision to sell at a loss.\nTwo of the properties, redstone buildings at 1511 and 1515 North Dearborn dating to 1890, were listed this week at $1.6 million apiece. The interiors were already gutted when Latin bought them and remain shells, according to\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe\n, who is marketing the pair. Latin is hoping to sell them together, potentially to a developer eyeing condos or to a buyer interested in restoring them as single-family homes.\nThe other two buildings, greystones at 1505 and 1507 Dearborn\nbuilt in the 1880s\n, contain a combined 15 apartments and are expected to list soon for just under $4.9 million, combined. Lowe and Interra Realty\u2019s\nJoe Smazal\nwill handle that listing, according to the publication. Those buildings are being sold as going concerns, with leased units and a mix of historic and modern finishes.\nAt the time of the purchase, then\u2013head of school Randall Dunn said Latin had no specific plan, but wanted to secure rare real estate opportunities in a dense neighborhood. Three years later, the school\u2019s own\nstudent newspaper reported\nthat concrete plans for the properties had yet to materialize, while the school was spending roughly $290,000 a year on taxes and maintenance.\nThe sale comes amid leadership turnover, with two heads of school departing since the acquisitions.\nLatin will still be a dominant presence on the block. Including the four buildings now for sale, the school owns eight of the 10 properties on the east side of Dearborn between North Avenue and Burton Place, anchored by an 18,000-square-foot mansion it bought in 2017 for $12 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s residential brokerages kicked off the new year with new agent recruits as industry consolidation pushes companies to sharpen their recruiting pitches.\nBaird &amp; Warner announced Steve Jasinski was returning to the firm after five years with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago. Jasinski is leading the Jasinski Home Team at Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s La Grange office.\nIn a press release, the firm said Jasinski\u2019s return was an example of its\nappeal as a local powerhouse\nversus a field of nationally consolidated competitors.\nWhen Jasinski left Baird &amp; Warner in 2021, he said he thought of it as \u201cyour grandfather\u2019s real estate company.\u201d Its purchase of\ntech-focused Dream Town\nin 2025 made him interested in coming back, he said.\nWhen he returned in December, he said he was surprised at how much the firm had embraced technology. The company\nreleased an AI chatbot\nfor its agents in December.\n\u201cThey actually have systems that are functioning and working together, and are actively working on new ones,\u201d Jasinski said. \u201cIt was truly like night and day.\u201d\nJasinski spent the last five years at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago, and was a Baird &amp; Warner agent for nine years before that.\nJasinski\u2019s team closed $26.5 million in sales across 70 transactions in 2024, according to Real Trends. He has two more agents on his team and said he\u2019s interested in expanding.\nBaird &amp; Warner also recently picked up a Highland Park team from Compass, citing the addition as another example of the firm\u2019s ability to attract talent from the most competitive national firms.\nThe Gerber Diaz Group, led by Louis Diaz and Joe Tyler Gerber, moved to Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Highland Park office in late 2025. Gerber closed more than $25 million in sales volume in 2024, Baird &amp; Warner said.\nBaird &amp; Warner said in a press release the brokerage\u2019s independence and local origin was a major influence in their decision to jump from Compass.\nCompass adds team with multifamily focus\nMeanwhile,\nCompass\nis attracting heavy hitters by pitching its own technology platform and reach. In early January, the brokerage brought on Charlie Cohen and Alex Morsch to create the Cohen Morsch team.\nThe five-agent team had combined annual sales of $57.5 million, Compass said in a press release. The group will focus on brokering multifamily and investment properties.\nCohen was most recently director of sales at Cross Street. In a press release announcing the move, Cohen said Compass\u2019 platform and tools will \u201celevate how we serve clients.\u201d\nMorsch was most recently a senior broker at Cross Street, Compass said. Morsch represented the buyer on a three-lot development site in Lincoln Park that sold for $5.7 million last year, the release said.\nCompass\nfinalized its acquisition of Anywhere Real Estate\nthis month, with the megamerger bringing some of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages under Compass\u2019 umbrella.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s gains Baird &amp; Warner agent\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\nis also expanding its roster. The firm brought on Joanne DeSanctis Kirk to its Chicago City Hub office this month.\nDeSanctis Kirk, who was previously at Baird &amp; Warner, said she wasn\u2019t expecting to make a move. But after conversations with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s representatives, she felt it was a good fit and gave her support as a solo agent. She said the firm\u2019s coordinated support between marketing and transactions has been a benefit.\n\u201cI had good support previously, but it was bifurcated,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is kind of a one stop shop.\u201d\nAs a solo agent, DeSanctis Kirk averages about $10 million to $15 million in sales a year, she said. She closed about $13.8 million in sales across 17 transactions between October 2024 and October 2025, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal.\nHer sales are spread across Chicago but focused in the North Side, she said.\nColdwell Banker brings on North Shore manager\nAt Coldwell Banker Realty, Natasha O\u2019Connor was appointed branch vice president of the brokerage\u2019s North Shore offices in Glenbrook and Lake Forest, Chicago Agent reported this month.\nO\u2019Connor was formerly a managing broker at @properties until 2023, according to her LinkedIn. She held roles at Prudential Rubloff and Baird &amp; Warner before that.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s multifamily construction drought isn\u2019t expected to improve any time soon, a report from Marcus and Millichap predicts.\nBy analyzing planned and ongoing multifamily developments, the brokerage predicts that this year Chicago is on track to see the smallest number of new apartments completed since 2012.\nLess than 4,000 new units will be completed this year, according to the report.\nThe pipeline issue has been brewing for a few years. Chicago\u2019s inventory of multifamily units grew at the fourth-slowest pace among major U.S. markets for the past three years, the brokerage found.\nPart of that is due to higher interest rates and escalating construction costs. But it\u2019s supercharged in Chicago specifically due to restrictive zoning,\ninfluence of aldermanic privilege over new developments\n,\nupheaval in the property tax system\nand investors\u2019 and lenders\u2019 fears of the city\u2019s progressive policies. Among them are right of first refusal ordinances that are\ncurrently being tested\nin\nseveral neighborhoods.\nThe tight supply is good news for current multifamily building owners and sellers, but means competition is high among buyers, and developers will face less equity investment and lending.\nAs low supply has driven up rents in recent years, Marcus &amp; Millichap predicts that trend will slow this year due to a slowdown in hiring that typically brings new professionals to the city.\nAcross the metro area, the 20 to 34-year-old renter population has been shrinking, according to the report.\nThe brokerage predicts that investment activity will continue to pick up along the North Lakefront-Rogers Park corridor in 2026.\nMeanwhile, developers seem to be favoring the outer suburbs. Lake County-Kenosha is slated to receive the most new units in 2026, the report found.\nAn Interra Realty report from last year found that\nmultifamily building sales in the Chicago suburbs were up 40 percent, year-over-year\n, in the third quarter, and a few outer-ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nWill County\u2019s largest deal last year was the sale of the\nLincoln Station Apartments.\nAfter a decade-long construction quest and an ensuing legal dispute, rescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments gave developer Richard Gammonley the green light to sell his newly built complex in New Lenox. Miami-based JSB Capital bought the 220-unit property from Gammonley and 7 Acre for $65 million.",

Building 12 at 1070 Maryland Street spans approximately 200,000 square feet and was once home to shipbuilding operations during World War II. The firm\u2019s move into 70,000 square feet makes it one of the largest venture capital tenants in San Francisco history by footprint, according to the Chronicle.\nGeneral Catalyst is moving from a roughly 12,000-square-foot office at 75 Hawthorne Street in\nSouth of Market\n.\nBuilding 12 has already\nattracted\nretail tenants such as Breadbelly and Standard Deviant Brewing and is the first part of Brookfield\u2019s plans for Pier 70, the San Francisco Business Times reported. New York-based Brookfield has been approved to turn the Pier 70 property into as many as 2,150 homes and nearly 1.8 million square feet of commercial space.\nBrookfield initially planned to deliver the first phase of Pier 70, including hundreds of homes and almost half a million square feet of offices, between 2022 and 2024, though the pandemic slowed down those efforts. So far, Brookfield has delivered new site infrastructure and renovated Building 12, both of which were completed before construction stalled. The 28-acre waterfront redevelopment is a public-private partnership between Brookfield and the Port of San Francisco and was valued at $3.5 billion in 2020.\nGeneral Catalyst manages $43 billion in assets and has backed\nAirbnb\n, Instacart and\nAnthropic\n\u2014 all companies with San Francisco headquarters. It won\u2019t be the only venture capital firm at Pier 70, as Monograph Capital inked a lease there in 2024. Other forthcoming significant portions of the Pier 70 development include Elevation XR\u2019s plans for an event venue similar to\nLas Vegas\n\u2019 Sphere called Elevation Sky Park, set to open this summer.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Seguin is officially putting public backing behind one of its largest commercial retail projects to date.\nThe Seguin City Council authorized City Manager Steve Parker last week to move forward with an economic development agreement with NewQuest for a 543-acre tract at the northwest corner of I-10 and Highway 46, within the Austin-San Antonio corridor. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal advances plans for Seguin Town Center, a master-planned project that could ultimately deliver more than 600,000 square feet of retail and anchor the city\u2019s fast-growing north side.\nNewQuest\n, a Houston-based retail and mixed-use developer, spent years assembling and entitling large sites across Texas. In Seguin, the firm is positioning Town Center as a regional draw rather than a neighborhood strip center, city officials told the outlet.\nThe agreement approved by council is tied to a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone created last year that covers the\nNewQuest site\n. Under the structure, a portion of the new tax revenue generated by development can be reinvested back into the project area. Guadalupe County has agreed to participate in the TIRZ, while\nSeguin\nis capturing part of the increment, allowing additional revenue from the site to flow into the city\u2019s general fund.\nCity leaders emphasized that the incentives are fully performance-based. No upfront payments are required, and if NewQuest fails to build, the city pays nothing.\nTo qualify for incentives, the developer must meet minimum thresholds, including at least $75 million in capital investment, construction of at least 200,000 square feet of retail and a lease from a nationally branded anchor tenant of at least 60,000 square feet, according to meeting documents. If those benchmarks are hit, NewQuest could receive up to $23.5 million in incentive value over a 20-year term, capped at roughly 10 percent of the project\u2019s anticipated value and limited to retail components.\nEconomic Development Director Alora Wachholz, who took the role in November, said the agreement signals alignment between the city and the developer and moves the project closer to construction.\nNewQuest is preparing to begin infrastructure and drainage work required before vertical construction can start. Groundbreaking for the first phase of retail is expected before mid-2026, with additional tenant announcements anticipated throughout the year.\nThe timing reflects\nSeguin\u2019s growth trajectory\n. The city\u2019s population has climbed from about 27,550 in 2015 to nearly 39,000 currently and is projected to top 50,000 by 2030, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Any possible changes to housing plans have not been revealed.\nIrvine Company officials are seeking the city\u2019s approval for the park by this summer, with work expected to begin early next year.\nCity politicians\nview the proposed Oak Park Village as beneficial in helping the municipality in meeting its state-mandated housing goals, which include\nplanning\nfor 23,610 new units by 2029.\nOn Jan. 15, the Committee to Protect All Irvine Open Space filed paperwork for a citizen initiative to reaffirm Initiative 88-1, a measure approved by voters in 1988 that requires citywide voter approval before residential development can occur on land designated as permanent open space.\nRolf Parkes, the vice chair of the committee which also includes two former Irvine mayors, said that part of the 216-acre Oak Park Village project consists of areas that the city has long deemed \u201copen space.\u201d Parkes is in favor of the nature park but is opposed to building homes and apartments that would bring increased traffic and congestion to the area, he told the Business Journal.\nThe committee hopes to collect signatures from more than 19,000 registered voters in Irvine to\nput the issue before voters\non the November ballot. Irvine Company cannot develop other open space areas outside the Oak Creek Golf Club because the firm transferred ownership of the land to the city, a spokesperson told the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One penthouse is left for sale at Houston\u2019s forthcoming\nSt. Regis condo project\n, and the listing price blows the city\u2019s other\ncondo sales\nout of the water.\nThe 4,670-square-foot unit is listed for $14.5 million or $3,100 per square foot. It\u2019s one of 90 condos at the 37-story tower planned for 102 Asbury Street at the doorstep of Houston\u2019s exclusive River Oaks neighborhood. The property\u2019s 40,000 square feet of amenities will include a 20th-floor cognac bar, pool deck with cabanas, spa, and to protect the property from Texas\u2019 notoriously finicky electrical grid, a full-building generator back-up.\nDouglas Elliman said the listing boasts the highest price per square foot in the history of Houston condo sales.\nHouston Association of Realtors data backs up the grandiose claim. The top 10 most expensive high-rise sales recorded in Houston range in asking price from $4.9 million to $7.5 million, putting prices per square foot at between $421 and $1,290.\nA unit at The Huntingdon, at 2121 Kirby Drive, tops the list, according to HAR. The 7,265-square-foot condo was listed for $7.5 million, or just over $1,000 per square foot, when it traded in June 2024.\nDeveloper Satya\u2019s St. Regis project, which is expected to start construction in the first quarter, is part of a\nbranded condo craze\ntaking over Houston. In addition to the St. Regis, other planned projects include a\nRitz-Carlton rising in the Woodlands\n, another\nRitz-Carlton planned for the Galleria\nand Auberge condos coming to Upper Kirby.\nThe Real Deal\npartnered with BSH to\nhost a panel on the trend\nin December at the BSH Experience &amp; Design Center.\nTexas luxury buyers have long favored ranches over vertical living, and, as a result, the state\u2019s\nmarket for luxury condos\nis still largely untapped. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s hard to get condo projects financed in the Lone Star State. Texas is one of about a dozen states that does not allow developers to use deposits from condo presales on construction. In states without those restrictions, deposits can finance up to 30 percent of construction costs, said DC Partners\u2019 Roberto Contreras IV.\nThe structural challenges mean not much condo inventory exists in Texas metros, but the Houston projects in the pipeline have already started proving the city\u2019s demand for luxury vertical living.\nIn addition to the price record set at the St. Regis,\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s London House\nopened last year in River Oaks with all but two units presold. Up in the Woodlands, Howard Hughes had to temporarily suspend sales for its Ritz-Carlton project because demand was so high. When construction started, 69 percent of the project\u2019s 111 units were presold.\n",

The complaint against the development entity, TCH 500 Alton, was filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in August.\nThe trust led by Newman, a former portfolio manager at Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, paid $17.3 million for a penthouse in 2024, about a month after the 48-story Five Park was\ncompleted\n.\nHe tried to reserve a guest apartment and allegedly was told there\u2019s no such amenity at the tower and that the developers were listing the apartments for sale, the lawsuit claims.

In April, Daniel Krizek, a biotech fund manager at Citadel\u2019s Surveyor Capital, paid\n$19.5 million\nfor a Five Park penthouse.\nA limited liability company linked to waste management mogul Patrick Dovigi\u2019s Toronto-based GFL Environmental also bought a penthouse, paying\n$17.5 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A dispute between an investor and a special servicer continues to play out in court.\nInvestor 400 Capital sued Rialto Capital Advisors late last year, accusing the special servicer of improperly keeping a loan in special servicing. Now, Rialto has changed track, but 400 Capital says it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nIt\u2019s a rare look into a fight between a commercial-backed mortgage securities investor and the nation\u2019s largest special servicer by volume. As of June, Rialto was the named special servicer on more than 5,000 loans with a total unpaid principal of more than $94 billion, according to Morningstar.\nAt the center of the court dispute is a $130 million loan \u2014 one connected to a Herald Square hotel and retail location. The loan landed in special servicing with Rialto in October. The borrower said it hasn\u2019t been able to get a refinancing loan to pay off its original debt before a January due date because of upcoming lease expirations.\nRialto ultimately struck a two-year deal with the borrower. The rub: the servicer calls it a forbearance agreement, but 400 Capital believes it to be a loan modification.\nThat difference in semantics matters to the investor. A loan modification would launch the loan out of special servicing. A forbearance agreement keeps it with Rialto. Staying in special servicing means certain fees for the borrower, as well as default interest, which the investor says benefits Rialto\u2019s but not certificateholders\u2019 interests.\n400 Capital\nfiled the suit in New York\njust before Christmas, seeking emergency action. The company hoped the court would stop Rialto from executing an agreement wherein it would collect millions in default interest before investors got paid out.\nBut Rialto changed the terms of that agreement and then executed it before the court could look into the matter.\nNow 400 Capital has withdrawn its motion for immediate relief, but isn\u2019t abandoning the suit entirely.\nThe investor says Rialto got caught with its hand in the cookie jar, which led to the last-minute change. Rialto has now agreed to get paid on the back end of the loan instead of up front. But the new agreement still keeps the loan in special servicing, meaning a 25 basis point fee paid to Rialto and default interest that piles up to be paid to Rialto once the loan is closed. That adds up to more for the borrower to pay and more for it to borrow.\n\u201cThe refinancing gap is only growing as a result of this agreement,\u201d said Quinn Barton, head of CMBS and CRE at 400 Capital. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing here is making it even more difficult for the borrower to repay the loan.\u201d\nRacking up interests and fees on a performing loan, 400 Capital says, hurts investors by making it less likely the loan will be paid off.\nAnd the loan is indeed performing, the investor argues. Net operating income is more than double its debt service payments, the property is fully leased and has about $6 million in annual excess cash flow.\n\u201cIt would be common for a loan to get a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day forbearance. Even up to a year might be common in our industry,\u201d said Catie McKee of 400 Capital. \u201cBut in this case it just seems very obvious that they have found this loophole where if they call it a forbearance they can keep it in special servicing and keep this whole fee scheme going.\u201d\nRialto, through its investment affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s largest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nRialto, for its part, says it\u2019s better for everyone to keep this loan in special servicing. That allows investors to foreclose on the property faster and streamline other remedies in the event of another default. It also allows for easier administration of the full cash sweep the borrower agreed to.\nAnd the default interest that\u2019s accruing incentivizes the borrower to pay off the loan as soon as possible.\n\u201cRialto won\u2019t get paid a dollar of default interest unless everybody else gets paid in full,\u201d Greg Cross, an attorney at Venable who is representing Rialto in the suit, said in a statement. \u201cAnd to the extent they get paid it will come from the borrower, just like any other fee in this transaction.\u201d\nThe 25 basis point fee that Rialto gets paid as an active special servicer would typically be paid by the trust, but in this case Rialto negotiated for it to be paid by the borrower.\nIn court, Rialto is seeking to have the case dismissed, arguing that 400 Capital doesn\u2019t have standing to pursue it. The investor is contractually obligated to bring complaints to its trustee before initiating a lawsuit and 400 Capital did not do that, Cross said in a memo to the court.\n",

The 423,000-square-foot office building would be condensed into 336,000 square feet thanks to design work by Rawlings Architects.\nFeatures of the conversion would include a basement fitness studio, a restaurant and a doctor\u2019s office on the first floor, as well as co-working space, bike storage and a pool on the seventh floor.\nBroad Street\u2019s vice president of operations and construction Ryan Bird filed the permits for the project, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nOffice tenants at the building include cannabis startup LeafLink and co-working company Regus. One tenant that probably won\u2019t need much convincing to relocate? Broad Street itself, which has its headquarters there.\nBroad Street bought the building in 2014 for $175 million. In December 2017, ownership\nsecured a $102 million mortgage\non the property, courtesy of AIG Investments.\nThe mortgage was issued about a month after Invesco purchased a 95 percent stake in the building from Broad Street for\n$235 million\n. Broad Street retained a 5 percent stake in the tower and continued to manage the property.\nIn 2021, PCCP\nissued \u200b\u200ba $150 million loan\nto refinance the building, shortly after a $9 million capital improvement project that included upgrades to the hallways, restrooms and lobby.\nManhattan\u2019s Financial District, long the money capital of the city, has become a mecca for conversions since the pandemic.

        "content": "When Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management makes an investment, it usually means a company, or in certain cases, a country, is in really bad shape.\nThe $76 billion hedge fund is best known for its distressed investments in Argentina\u2019s bonds, resulting in a 15-year legal battle and leading the country to default on its debt. It waged war against Procter &amp; Gamble in the early 2000s over their attempt to takeover the German shampoo company Wella. It took control of the Italian soccer club AC Milan after the previous owner defaulted on its debt.\nBut the firm\u2019s most recent buy may not be such a bad thing for the downtrodden office market.\nElliott and Mukang Cho\u2019s Morning Calm Management recently closed on the acquisition of an obscure REIT in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.\nThe company, City Office, is an oddity. It\u2019s headquartered in Vancouver and has employees there, but has no properties in Canada. Instead, it bought humdrum office buildings in the Sun Belt. It controlled 4.2 million square feet of office space, commanding a modest $34.89 in gross rent per square foot. Its stock price has been underwhelming, reaching a high of $21 in 2022. In the end, shareholders received just $7 per share, a 26 percent premium from its last day of trading.\nBut Elliott\u2019s move to acquire City Office (surely a winner of the most creative office company name contest) may be an early tell in the post-Covid real estate landscape: investors are circling again, a sign the market may finally be scraping the bottom.\nIndustry insiders have long predicted that big-money investors like Elliott would acquire troubled public real estate companies and take them private, betting on a mismatch between office landlords\u2019 stock prices and the underlying value of their assets in a market that had sharply discounted the sector.\nRecently, there have been a few notable deals. Rithm Capital bought Paramount Group, a troubled office landlord in NYC and San Francisco, led by a CEO who fancied lavish expenditures and lunches at Le Bernardin, in a $1.6 billion deal.\nOthers appear to be lining up. Franklin Street, a Massachusetts-based office REIT with 4.8 million square feet of office space in the Mountain West and the Sunbelt, is seeking suitors as its stock price fell beneath $1. Phoenix-based Orion Properties, which owns 8 million square feet of office, is exploring a sale after stopping a takeover attempt by Kawa Capital.\nResuscitating REITs is not for the faint of heart. The maneuvers take time, burn capital and leave little room for error.\n\u201cA potential buyer has to make the determination that, even with the share premium he will likely need to pay, the juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d said Mukang Cho, whose firm purchased CIty Office REIT with Elliott Management. \u201cMy sense is many buyers might see value [in taking REITs private], but are hesitant \u2013 somewhat understandably \u2013 to then take the next step,\u201d he said.\nStill, the opportunity is tempting. Let\u2019s look at Rithm\u2019s acquisition of Paramount.\nAccording to Rithm, Paramount\u2019s stock was trading at 40 percent discount to its book value. Furthermore, the $1.6 billion deal was a fraction of the $6.6 billion that Paramount valued its real estate at. By that math, Paramount sold for a song.\nRithm believes its acquisition could result in an impressive 20x internal rate of return.\nParamount\u2019s office towers may not be the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of NYC office stock, but they are 85 percent leased and commanding $90 per square foot. That\u2019s not exactly distressed pricing.\n\u201cThe overall entry point on the underlying assets at what we think are very, very attractive values,\u201d said Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a call with analysts explaining the move.\nThe firm\u2019s executives also pointed to NYC\u2019s office market resurgence.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no new construction, 10 percent of the inventory is coming offline with the conversions. And the return to work phenomenon is back now 4 to 5 days a week,\u201d said another Rithm exec on the call.\nOf course, not all office market recoveries are experiencing the same upswing as NYC. The nationwide vacancy rate remains around 20 percent. Finding a deep-pocketed investor like Elliott or Rithm willing to write the checks required to pull off these deals remains difficult, and there are only a handful of office REITs trading.\nBut the job of the office landlord has vastly\nevolved\n. In NYC, if you bought in the core business district, made sure the lobbies and bathrooms were clean, you could land tenants. Many of these landlords weren\u2019t operators, they were investors who saw office as their investment vehicle. That\u2019s changed. Tenants are picky and seek out buildings with critical amenities like podcasting rooms or signature scents. Or maybe driving range simulators for those junior analysts who need to work on their short game.\nFor investors that can buy at a low enough basis, and put in the money to upgrade buildings, and hold on long enough to catch the market\u2019s resurgence, there\u2019s at least a chance of an outsized return.\n",

        "content": "A New York-based distressed mall buyer is expanding its Chicago office holdings, taking control of a Loop office building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure after scooping up its debt at a steep discount.\nA venture of\nKohan Retail Investment Group\nlate last week took title to the 28-story building at 33 West Monroe Street, wresting the property from an affiliate of New York-based AmTrust RE. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat Kohan CEO Mike Kohan confirmed the move, which followed the firm\u2019s purchase of a $60 million loan backed by the building last fall.\nThe 900,000-square-foot building, at the southeast corner of Monroe and Dearborn streets, is the latest prominent downtown office property to change hands via distress. Rather than slug it out in court, AmTrust\nhanded over the keys\n, a route increasingly favored by owners and lenders looking to avoid long foreclosure battles, according to the publication.\nKohan\ntook its first step toward ownership in November, when it bought the mortgage from a venture of Des Moines-based Principal Life Insurance. AmTrust had secured the debt in a 2011 refinancing, according to Cook County records. While Kohan declined to disclose what it paid for the loan, the outlet noted that the brokerage Transwestern reported in October that it was under contract for about $25 million.\nGreat Neck, New York-based Kohan, best known as a buyer of troubled malls and shopping centers, isn\u2019t an obvious office landlord. But Kohan told the outlet that the company plans to use its low cost to lure tenants with aggressive rents.\n\u201cWe are looking for tenants that didn\u2019t have the opportunity to be part of [the building at 33 West Monroe] to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make a deal.\u201d\nThe building is about 44 percent leased, according to CoStar, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent. Built in 1981, it was once the headquarters of Arthur Andersen before the accounting firm\u2019s collapse in the early 2000s.\nThe Monroe Street acquisition follows Kohan\u2019s bargain buy last year of the 65-story tower at 311 South Wacker Drive for $45 million, a sliver of the $302 million that building fetched in 2014.\nFor AmTrust, the handoff adds to a rough stretch in Chicago. The firm has already lost the building at\n30 North LaSalle Street\nto foreclosure and is battling a foreclosure lawsuit tied to its $260 million Illinois Center mortgage. It has also flirted with surrendering the building at 135 South LaSalle Street before pivoting to an office-to-apartment plan under the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined program.\nWith high interest rates, sagging values and loans coming due, more Loop owners are facing similar choices. Just last month, Chicago-based Nuveen took control of the building at 321 North Clark Street to resolve a troubled loan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Brugnara has reportedly been squatting on the land, putting up the fence as a way of making the property private,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Chronicle.\nThe property has reportedly been owned by a local family for decades, but in December, a trust tied to Brugnara\npurchased\nthe land, the New York Post reported. Brugnara allegedly hung up a sign with a hand-drawn image of a gun and a message that trespassers will be \u201cshot on [sight].\u201d\nSan Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa, who lives nearby, has asked the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission\nto remove the illegal chain-link fence. If Brugnara isn\u2019t the rightful property owner, the commission\u2019s intervention would not be needed.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time the real estate investor has made news in the Bay Area. In 2010, Brugnara pleaded guilty to tax evasion and to violating the Endangered Species Act for reportedly poaching steelhead trout and blocking a dam on property he owned in Gilroy.\nIn 2002, he bought a\nmansion in San Francisco\u2019s Sea Cliff\nonce owned by actor Cheech Marin and built an illegal staircase down the cliff from the home to a small private beach. A lender sold the manse in 2024 for $7 million, down about $10 million from its 2021 list price and sold with the caveat that the new owner would have to pay to have the staircase removed.\nBrugnara stored $11 million in\nartwork\nin that home\u2019s garage. He claimed the pieces were gifts that were shipped from a gallery in New York. He was charged and convicted for mail fraud in 2015 after failing to pay for the purchases; the investor represented himself at trial and reportedly was found in contempt for disrupting court proceedings. Brugnara denied any wrongdoing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They add fresh allegations to two existing indictments that accuse Lewis-Martin of bribery and money laundering, alleging she abused her position as the mayor\u2019s chief advisor to make regulatory problems disappear for politically connected developers.\nAmong the latest claims, prosecutors say Lewis-Martin accepted a pair of two-carat diamond earrings worth about $3,000 from\ndevelopers Raizada \u201cPinky\u201d Vaid and Mayank Dwivedi\nat the start of the Adams administration. In return, she allegedly leaned on city agencies to fast-track approvals for projects including the Hotel Rivington and a rooftop bar called the Glass Ceiling.\nPotentially more explosive for City Hall and the real estate industry is the allegation that DOB officials internally raised red flags about safety. A top buildings official warned that the hotel renovation Lewis-Martin was pushing forward lacked critical information about occupancy load and whether the building had adequate fire egress, according to the filings.\nDespite those concerns, Lewis-Martin repeatedly pressed then-acting DOB Commissioner Kazimir Vilenchik to move the project along.\nEmails cited by prosecutors show DOB staff expressing unease that Lewis-Martin was trying to \u201ccircumvent the process.\u201d In one instance, after Lewis-Martin texted that a project needed to be moved forward, a new plan examiner was assigned within an hour. Permits soon followed.\nLewis-Martin resigned in December 2024, days before her\nfirst indictment was unsealed\n.\nProsecutors accused her of\nsteering $100,000\nfrom the same developers into a joint account she shared with her son, funds later used to buy a Porsche. Other alleged benefits include cash, free catering at Gracie Mansion events and a speaking role on the TV series \u201cGodfather of Harlem,\u201d tied to a separate scheme involving pressure on DOT over a contested bike lane.\nHer attorney, Arthur Aidala, dismissed Bragg\u2019s latest filing as overreach, calling it a \u201cdesperate\u201d response.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The pandemic-era slowdown in productions and 2023 actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes, along with the increasing costs of production in Los Angeles, have driven away productions. Shoot days fell 16 percent last year compared to 2024, according to a forthcoming FilmLA report for 2025 cited by the Times.\nThe declining figures are a fall from grace from just a few years ago. In 2021, independent studio owner Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital Management bought Radford Studio Center in Studio City for nearly $1.9 billion. The owners defaulted on their $1.1 billion mortgage earlier this month, and lender Goldman Sachs is\nexpected to seize control\nof the studio lot.\nSome studio owners are hopeful that the state\u2019s expanded film tax credits, which grew last year to $750 million from $330 million, will be helpful in stimulating production growth and creating some \u201cgreen shoots\u201d for the industry, as Wainwright said. \u201cI would like to think that 2024 and 2025 are kind of the bottom and that we\u2019re going to be pulling ourselves up,\u201d he told the Times.\nIn the meantime, studio developers like East End have been improvising by\nlooking to adaptive reuse\nas a way of increasing studio space without initiating new construction projects. East End\u2019s new downtown campus is partially built at a former cold-storage facility, and Amazon turned buildings in downtown Culver City into its Culver Studios facility.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A national data center land developer is making a big first move into the Chicago region, scooping up hundreds of acres of farmland in Grundy County for a power-hungry campus that would rank among the largest in the Midwest.\nAn affiliate of Denver-based Tract acquired a 343-acre site off I-80 in Morris, Illinois, paying about $51.5 million to an affiliate of Clarius Partners, according to public records. Bisnow\nreported\nthat the property sits roughly 50 miles from Midway Airport and about 65 miles southwest of downtown Chicago, firmly in exurban territory but close enough to tap the region\u2019s fiber and power backbone.\nTract\nplans to develop the land into the Morris Technology Park, a 2.9 million-square-foot data center campus designed to support up to 1 gigawatt of power load. Initial energization is targeted for June 2028, with the full load ramping up by 2032, the company said in a press release.\nThe project has been several years in the making and required close coordination with the city of Morris, Commonwealth Edison and the Illinois Economic Development Corporation, according to Tract President Graham Williams. The work includes a transmission security agreement with ComEd, a critical step for any hyperscale-scale development, according to the statement.\nTract\u2019s business model is to buy raw land, lock down zoning and entitlements and then build out heavy infrastructure \u2014 power, fiber, roads, water and sewer \u2014 before selling sites to hyperscalers or other data center developers. The company typically spends between $100 million and $150 million per site to get land ready, Mayor Chris Brown told local station WCSJ last year, often courting tenants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\nCity officials approved the infrastructure plan last year, with most local leaders confident the grid could handle the demand. Supporters have pointed to improvements in data center efficiency and relatively low traffic impacts. Still, the project hasn\u2019t been without controversy. Morris Alderman Alex Clubb voted against it, raising concerns about water usage and the potential need for a new water facility that the city might have to help fund.\nBrown later said the city is in \u201cgood shape\u201d on water and is considering construction of a larger facility to support long-term growth.\nThe deal marks Tract\u2019s first Chicago-area play, adding the region to a national portfolio that includes more than 25 gigawatts of planned capacity across 25,000 acres in markets like\nArizona\n,\nTexas\n, Virginia and Iowa. Tract estimates the Morris campus would generate more than 1,000 construction jobs and about 350 permanent positions \u2014 a sizable boost for a city of roughly 14,600 people.\nThe Morris announcement outside of Chicagoland comes as suburban Chicago debates how much\ndata center development\nit wants.\nBarrington Hills Village officials announced on Monday that Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposed $2 billion data center campus in Barrington Hills following \u201cnegative early feedback\u201d from village officials and organized community opposition, canceling a Feb. 2 public hearing.\nLast week, Naperville officials killed a far smaller 145,000-square-foot proposal from Karis Critical, citing concerns over power availability and long-term economic tradeoffs, and Lisle officials paused a proposed data center after residents packed Village Hall with objections.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A fast-growing suburban Houston personal injury firm is putting down a pricey marker in Pearland, planning a $14 million headquarters along one of the region\u2019s fast-growing suburban corridors.\nJ.D. Silva &amp; Associates is aiming to break ground this summer on a three-story, 42,400-square-foot office building at the intersection of Beltway 8 and U.S. Highway 288, pending city permits,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The building, dubbed \u201cLawplex,\u201d would rise on a 1.9-acre parcel the firm bought in February 2024 between a Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites and Bombshells Restaurant &amp; Bar.\nJ.D. Silva launched just five years ago with two lawyers and two other employees. Today, it employs about 60 people, including 11 attorneys, said Ernest Rojas, the firm\u2019s director of corporate services.\nThe law firm initially planned to develop the building with Houston-based Z-Co, but that partnership fell apart. J.D. Silva is now working with Powers Brown Architecture, another Houston firm, and is currently soliciting bids for a general contractor, the outlet reported.\nDesign-wise, Lawplex is meant to stand out in\nPearland\n. Plans call for glass walls, staggered floor plates with the largest floor on top, a rooftop patio and a centrally located staircase that lights up at night. That modern look required some back-and-forth with city officials, Rojas told the publication, because it departs sharply from the area\u2019s more conventional suburban architecture.\nConstruction is expected to take 12 to 14 months. Once complete, J.D. Silva plans to occupy roughly 30,000 square feet of the building, leasing out the first floor to office or retail tenants.\nThe firm currently leases about 10,000 square feet in a building at 9307 Broadway Street that already bears its name, and has added smaller outposts in Angleton in Brazoria County and McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley as its caseload has expanded, according to the publication.\nThe future site puts the firm directly across Highway 288 from a nearly 100-acre tract that has repeatedly teased a massive mixed-use future. Houston-based\nNewQuest\nabandoned a $350 million development\nplanned\nthere in 2023, the second time a developer has walked away from the property.\n\u201cThe 288 corridor is getting denser, better demographics and more rooftops,\u201d\nPearland\nEconomic Development Corporation President Matt Buchanan told the Business Journal last year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The facility at 619 West 14th Street is owned by Elevate Research Properties, a subsidiary of Taconic Partners.\nThe asking rent and length of lease were not disclosed; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai signed a lease two years ago for 10,000 square feet, when the asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s slightly below today\u2019s rates.

Prior to the lease execution, which took place in late October, the space was leased to the NYSCF.\nTaconic purchased the 10-story office building at the site \u2014 formerly known as The Movie Lab Building because of Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 occupancy \u2014 for $112 million in 2012. Five years later, Silverstein Properties\nbought a majority stake\n, valuing the property at more than $180 million, while Taconic retained a 10 percent interest.\nThe partners invested $20 million to revamp the building, aiming to bring in research and pharmaceutical tenants. The property represented Silverstein\u2019s first life sciences project.\nIn 2020, Silverstein and Taconic refinanced the property with $205 million from Affinius Capital, then known as Square Mile Capital.\nBut in 2023, Silverstein tapped Eastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman to\nmarket its interest\nin the Hudson Research Center. A buyer had the opportunity to either recapitalize and join up with Taconic or purchase the property outright in a fee simple sale.\nA few weeks ago, Affiinius acquired the stake from Silverstein, valuing the property at $191.7 million, according to\nPincusCo\n.

It brings his total spend on the 3.7-acre assemblage to $58.3 million.\nJonathan Potsma with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the buyer and seller.\nFlancbaum is the head of New Jersey-based custom homebuilder Colts Neck Associates, which has developed homes in Marlboro, Colts Neck, North Howell, Brick, Manalapan, Millstone and Toms River, all in New Jersey. Susan Rizzuto is the daughter of Leandro P. Rizzuto, the late billionaire co-founder of hair products maker Conair. He was worth $3.5 billion when he died in 2017, according to Forbes.\nShe is a trustee of her father\u2019s namesake foundation along with her siblings, Leandro Rizzuto Jr., Denis Rizzuto and Babe Rizzuto. In 2024, Leandro Rizzuto Jr. bought a home in Boca Raton\u2019s Royal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club for\n$18.5 million\n. Babe Rizzuto bought an oceanfront compound in Jupiter Inlet Colony for\n$35 million\nin 2022, and she listed it for $55.6 million in 2023 but had no luck finding a buyer.\nFlancbaum and Susan Rizzuto have invested in other South Florida homes.

        "content": "Chicagoland\u2019s most expensive home listing took a $2.5 million price cut this week, more than a year after it first hit the market.\nThe 15,000-square-foot mansion at 595 Circle Lane in Lake Forest, on the grounds of a historic estate, had its price cut to $25 million on Tuesday. The six-bedroom, nine bathroom estate was listed at\n$27.5 million in September 2024\n, and has been on and off the market a few times at the same price.\nEven with the 9 percent price cut, the home remains the priciest active listing in the Chicago metro area, surpassing an $18.5 million Gold Coast mansion on Dearborn Street. The asking price would make it easily the most expensive home ever sold in Lake Forest.\nThe Italianate-style mansion sits on a 5.3-acre lot with 570 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and includes a boathouse, swimming pool and spa. The property also has a garage complex with space for 22 cars.\nThe home is owned by Terry Rozdolsky, according to property records. Rozdolsky founded Lake Forest-based Harbortown Industries, a wholesale supplier of picture frames for retailers like Walmart and Target.\nRozdolsky purchased the site in 2010 for $4.5 million, property records show. He built the current mansion in 2019 after tearing down the existing home. Rozdolsky paid about $171,000 in property taxes in 2025, county records show.\nAnn Lyon, the @properties agent representing the seller, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOne of the estate\u2019s unique features is a grand staircase descending the bluff to the lake, a remnant of the Villa Turicum estate that once occupied the site.\nThe 269-acre Villa Turicum estate was established in the early 20th century by Harold McCormick\u00a0 \u2014 son of International Harvester founder Cyrus McCormick \u2014 and Edith Rockefeller McCormick, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller. The opulent 44-room home, designed by architect Charles Platt, fell into disrepair after Rockefeller McCormick\u2019s death in 1932, and it was eventually demolished, with the land split up into 161 separate lots.\nThe latest price cut comes after North Shore homes reached unprecedented price levels in 2025. Two homes in Winnetka each\nsold for more than $30 million last fall\n, marking the most expensive home resales in Illinois history.\nLake Forest has seen some eight-figure deals recently, as well. An 11,800-square-foot mansion sold for $11 million in October. The home was sold by the\nestate of Posy Krehbiel\n, a Lake Forest socialite and philanthropist and the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., the co-chairman of electronics company Molex.\nIn 2022, the\nwidow of filmmaker John Hughes\nsold a Lake Forest home for nearly $13 million.\nIn Chicago, other luxury homes cut prices this month, as the downtown market continues to adjust after a long downturn. A duplex condo at 950 North Michigan Avenue was relisted on Monday at $5.5 million after previously asking $6 million. The 9,000-square-foot home hit the market in September and is being marketed by Ryan Preuett and Tim Salm of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nAt the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive, a 4,700-square-foot unit, also listed by Preuett, took a $450,000 price cut in early January. The owner is now asking $6 million for the condo.\n",

SL Green and RXR are the current owners of Worldwide Plaza. Extell, meanwhile, quietly acquired the senior mezzanine debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot office complex this fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the most recent ruling, however, we still own and control the asset and we believe we will ultimately reach a resolution with the mezz lender which meets all parties\u2019 objectives,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said.\nThe ruling came after the landlords sued to block the sale, arguing it was a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown property without a fair, competitive process. The firms claimed the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Barnett.\nExtell\npushed back hard\nagainst the allegations, calling RXR and SL Green\u2019s lawsuit meritless and accusing the two developers of trying to derail a sale they have known about for months. Barnett\u2019s camp argued in a legal filing that the mezzanine lender is within its rights to foreclose after a default and that the auction was properly noticed and structured.\nThe judge ultimately sided with Barnett, emphasizing in her ruling that contracts must generally be enforced, especially when negotiated by \u201csophisticated, counseled businesspeople,\u201d even if market conditions have changed since the deal was struck.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of senior mezzanine debt in 2017 that was later transferred to Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group, which sold it to Extell.\nWorldwide Plaza has been a prime example of the office market\u2019s continued distress. Control of the mezzanine debt would give the winning bidder significant leverage over the property\u2019s future.\nThe property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\nthat\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. The landlords defaulted on both senior and mezzanine debt in July, per public filings.\nExtell is the only qualified bidder lined up for the auction, but Masley said that does not render the sale commercially unreasonable.\n\u201cOur position on Worldwide Plaza has long been clear \u2014 while we moved the asset into our Alternative Strategy Portfolio over two years ago given that we attribute little to no value to the asset, we have a plan to revitalize the building and the capital to execute it,\u201d the SL Green spokesperson said.\nAn Extell representative declined to comment. RXR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Anthony Donato is fast becoming the\nbaron of Bannockburn\nthrough purchases of troubled real estate.\nThe resident of the wealthy suburban Chicago enclave in the North Shore paid $20 million this week to buy the 114-acre former Trinity International University campus, he confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n. It marks a significant discount from a previous deal\nTexas real estate titan Ross Perot Jr. eyed\nfor the property before backing away.\nDonato and his wife Anna\u2019s nonprofit foundation acquired the sprawling North Shore site featuring 26 buildings just months after another of his ventures snapped up the nearby Bannockburn Lakes office park for $17 million. The office park\u2019s price amounted to a painful haircut for the sellers, Chicago-based\ncommercial real estate heavy hitters Walton Street Capital and Glenstar\n, after they spent $43 million between 2015 and last year buying and upgrading the property.\nPerot Jr.\u2019s Dallas-based firm, Hillwood, had considered buying the Trinity property for years, with plans to pay about $35 million for most of the land and embark upon commercial redevelopment that could have brought industrial, office, lab or other corporate uses to the campus.\nAccording to a person familiar with the deal, Hillwood was interested in redeveloping the land for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which has a large office space in an adjacent Bannockburn property. But Hillwood walked away after sensing community resistance to the plan, and\nTakeda this month opted to expand a separate lease\nit has in a Libertyville corporate campus by about 80,000 square feet.\nAfter shuttering its residential and in-person education operations in Bannockburn in recent years, Trinity was still in a rush to find a buyer. The school had a $16 million bridge loan against the property it took out in late 2024 from Connecticut-based lender JGB Management.\nThe Donatos leveraged their home field advantage to secure the site in a sprint, closing the deal in just seven weeks. They financed the purchase with a bank loan, they said, but declined to name the lender or the loan amount. Hillwood declined to comment.\nUnlike Hillwood\u2019s commercial ambitions, the Donatos pitch a vision that might be more well-received by village residents: a massive youth and amateur sports complex. The centerpiece will be a 300,000-square-foot to 400,000-square-foot indoor arena they are planning to build to replace the campus\u2019 Meyer Sports Complex. It will feature multiple basketball courts, volleyball and indoor soccer facilities, and perhaps an ice arena for hockey and other skating-based competition. The property already includes full-size outdoor football, baseball and softball fields the Donatos intend to use as part of their programming. They said they expect the addition to cost another $40 million to $50 million and think they could break ground within 18 months, while preparing to gain village approval for the project.\nThey also want to bring other entertainment concepts to the property, such as golf simulators and perhaps mini-golf, arcades, escape rooms and more, and see opportunities to host summer camps and corporate retreats that could make use of the property\u2019s commercial kitchen and cafeteria that can feed 1,000 people per meal.\nThey\u2019re toying with the idea of building a higher-end hotel on the property, as well, and capitalizing on the property\u2019s proximity to multiple major highways by adding retail uses, such as restaurants and shops that would be fueled by traffic from families and athletes attending sporting events.\n\u201cWe could truly hold a tournament here every weekend,\u201d Anna Donato said. Their oldest of three children, an 11-year-old daughter, has also given them a list with dozens of ideas for the property, they said. They hope to have sports leagues running at the property as soon as this spring.\nThe Donatos previously expressed interest in buying at least a portion of the Trinity campus for their vision, but were unable to make a deal while Hillwood was still in the mix. The couple purchased the Bannockburn Lakes office complex in July with plans to turn some of that five-building campus spanning 530,000 square feet of interior space into an athletics-focused complex. Now, one of the Bannockburn Lakes buildings will be converted into self-storage or temperature-controlled storage uses. The Donatos are also trying to lease up much of the vacant office space at the property, hiring JLL last year to market it to potential tenants.\n\u201cThere\u2019s endless things you could put here,\u201d Anthony Donato said of the Trinity property. \u201cAll the sports-oriented stuff, I call that the anchor that drives its own version of traffic, where you\u2019re going to have thousands of kids come every weekend.\u201d\nHe found success in the solar power development field while also gaining some experience with multifamily and retail real estate. The Bannockburn Lakes and Trinity deals are his largest office and development plays, however.\nThe couple\u2019s plan coincidentally could have some synergy with the\nChicago Red Stars\n. The professional women\u2019s soccer team earlier this month announced plans to build a $30 million-plus training performance center on an adjacent Bannockburn parcel, creating a de facto sports district in the suburb. The Donatos weren\u2019t aware the Red Stars were keen on the area when they put out their offer for Trinity.\nTrinity International confirmed the sale to a \u201cprivate real estate investment entity\u201d in a statement, but declined to comment on the religious school\u2019s financial situation. Trinity controlled the property for over 60 years, but faced declining enrollment in suburban Chicago, and last year announced it was merging with Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada. Its shutdown of most of the campus \u2014 with several buildings that have stayed open, including its library and chapel \u2014 was originally planned in 2023.\nFor Donato, the deal cements a rapid accumulation of more than 150 acres of prime North Shore land at bargain-basement pricing. By targeting property that institutional capital has either fled or failed to unlock, he\u2019s betting as a local operator, he can navigate the zoning and political dynamics that scared off out-of-towners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the village to get permission to do everything,\u201d Anthony Donato said. \u201cBig goals to hit the ground running as fast as we can.\u201d\n",

The structures are at 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street.\nStarwood Capital\nowned the buildings prior to the\nlender takeover\n. The unpaid debt for the three office buildings totals $442.1 million, according to filings cited by the Mercury News. The original loan Deutsche Bank provided to Starwood totaled $364.5 million, per Alameda County real estate records.\nStarwood bought the office buildings in 2019 for a total of $494 million. At the time, the purchase was seen as a vote of confidence in the Oakland office market. The Covid-19 pandemic that broke out the following year sent\noffice values\nin San Francisco and across the Bay Area spiraling, leading to bargain-basement sales and foreclosures in the region.\nWhen Starwood bought the buildings, the\noffice vacancy rate in downtown Oakland\nwas approximately 7.5 percent, according to a Colliers report cited by the Mercury News. Today, nearly six years after the outbreak of the pandemic, the vacancy rate has not gotten close to recovering. In the fourth quarter of last year, the office vacancy rate in downtown Oakland was 28.5 percent, according to Colliers.\nThe 2101 Webster building rises 20 stories and spans 473,000 square feet. The 1901 Harrison structure is 17 stories tall with 285,000 square feet, and 2100 Franklin is 10 stories with 217,000 square feet. The three office buildings total 975,000 square feet, according to the Mercury News. Because the properties are on separate parcels, the Deutsche Bank affiliate could offload the buildings in individual transactions should it choose to sell them.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Silicon Valley\nquantum computing\ncompany will move its headquarters to Boca Raton, bolstering Palm Beach County boosters\u2019 drive to turn the area into a hub for tech firms.\nD-Wave Quantum, now based in Palo Alto, California, will open its headquarters and a research and development facility by year\u2019s end at the Boca Raton Innovation Campus, according to news releases from the tenant and landlords. D-Wave leased about 25,000 square feet, according to a CP Group spokesperson.\nFounded in 1999 and taken public in 2022, D-Wave provides dual-platform quantum computing. Alan Baratz is CEO.\nD-Wave signed a $20 million agreement with Florida Atlantic University for the school to purchase an Advantage2 annealing quantum computer, and to have it installed at its Boca Raton campus. After the deal was announced Tuesday, D-Wave\u2019s stock rose 1.6 percent, Investor\u2019s Business Daily\nreported\n.\nAlso on Tuesday, D-Wave announced a collaboration with Davidson Technologies and defense tech firm Anduril Industries to develop quantum applications for U.S. air and missile defense.\nBoca Raton-based CP Group and New York-based DRA Advisors own the 1.7 million-square-foot Boca Raton Innovation Campus, or\nBRiC\n, at 5000 T-Rex Avenue. The campus was developed in the 1960s by IBM for its research and development.\nDRA, led by David Luski, paid\n$320.2 million\nfor a stake in BRiC in 2021. CP Group is led by Angelo Bianco and Chris Eachus.\nThe firms recently completed a $100 million capital improvement of the campus.\nD-Wave\u2019s move from Silicon Valley to Boca Raton boosts the narrative that South Florida has a growing tech industry supporting real estate leasing. The excitement picked up at the onset of the pandemic when Silicon Valley firms rushed to the tri-county region, which had reopened for business and hosted the 2020 bitcoin conference. At the time, much of the industry excitement was over Miami\u2019s Wynwood, which was a magnet for the techies.\nAs a whole, data showed the influx of tech companies\ndidn\u2019t translate\nto hefty office leasing in South Florida. And over the past three years, some of the South Florida firms moved back to Silicon Valley, especially since the area is considered the biggest ecosystem for AI, the latest fad in tech.\nBut over the past year, there\u2019s been a renewed push to grow the tech industry but in a different South Florida area: Palm Beach County, and especially the city of West Palm Beach. The drive is\nled by billionaire Steve Ross\nand other executives at Related Ross, the West Palm-based real estate firm Ross founded in 2024.\nAt Related Ross\u2019 23-story 10 City Place building, under construction in downtown West Palm, Fortune 500 cloud computing firm ServiceNow pre-leased\n211,900 square feet\n. It marked last year\u2019s\ntop\nSouth Florida office lease.\u00a0Vanderbilt University is expected to start construction soon for its\n$520 million\nWest Palm campus that will offer business and tech graduate programs. Ross and other real estate heavyweights played a pivotal role in helping bring the Nashville-based university to West Palm, with Ross committing $50 million in April, hosting fundraisers and advocating publicly for the campus.\n",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, counts Los Angeles County homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service for $4 million or more.\nThe estate is currently asking $12.9 million, or $1,381 per square foot.\nBuilt in 1913, the\nhome\nwas designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, with its ties to Los Angeles Times owners Norman Chandler and Dorothy Buffum Chandler. The Chandlers, who bought the property in 1950, referred to the home as \u201cLos Tiempos,\u201d or The Times in Spanish.\nIts other name as the \u201cWestern White House\u201d comes from the parade of presidents \u2014 including Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon \u2014 along with diplomats and other high-profile individuals welcomed as guests at the estate. The Los Angeles Music Center, which includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, in Downtown Los Angeles was built with the help of fundraisers held at the Hancock Park residence.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Shahryar Bastani and Beverly and Company\u2019s Shiva Rafizadeh hold the listing.\nCurrent sellers, Nigerian furniture manufacturer Robert Oshodin and his wife Mimie Oshodin, acquired the property for $9.5 million in 2014 to, according to property records. About two years later they\nmarketed the home for $50 million\nfollowing several renovations.\nFit for entertaining, the Beaux Arts-style home has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, music room, guest house and wine cellar. It sits on nearly 1 acre.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, based on asking price, was 1150 Stone Canyon Road in Bel-Air.\nThe property, which sits above the Hotel Bel-Air, is priced at just under $8 million, or $1,525 per square foot. With an over 3-acre lot, it\u2019s being marketed for its development possibility.\nThe lot currently holds an over 5,000-square-foot home with six beds and six baths.\nCompass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones holds the listing.\nRecords show the property owner is a trust tied to the artist Vivian Angelini.\nOverall, Los Angeles County was mostly quiet last week when it came to dealmaking with a dozen homes entering into contract, equating to a little over $75 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes\nreport\n. That\u2019s off about 75 percent from the year-ago total volume.\n",

The new offices will be in the southern annex on a block that once was home to the headquarters of the Los Angeles Times and known as Times-Mirror Square.\nGSA\u2019s space spans a number of floors in Onni Group\u2019s 145 South Spring Street, and the largest federal defender office in the U.S. will move into the space in the first quarter of 2027.\nThe GSA liked the property \u201cdue to its proximity to courthouses, landlord\u2019s ability to fund and perform tenant improvements, and overall competitive economics on the lease,\u201d JLL\u2019s Peter Hajimihalis said. Lease details weren\u2019t immediately available.\nHajimihalis and JLL colleagues James Malone, Dana Vargas and Howard Traul represented Onni in the deal along with Onni Group\u2019s in-house leasing team of Neal Linthicum and Malcolm Kluth. Timothy Pavek at Carpenter/Robbins Commercial Real Estate worked on behalf of GSA.\nFederal Public Defenders Central District of California will be relocating from 321 East 2nd Street in the Little Tokyo part of DTLA.\nDeveloper Onni Group, headquartered in Vancouver, acquired the 10-story, 243,749-square-foot 145 South Spring Street in September 2016 for $105 million, per property records. The structure is a historical part of the Times-Mirror Square four-building office complex. The building was integral to the LA Times\u2019 operations for 70 years until the company relocated in 2018.\nThe publication has a small fraction of the staff and revenue it commanded at its heights. It sold off Times-Mirror Square under prior ownership and now is located in El Segundo at a building in the portfolio of current owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.\nOnni has been investing in Downtown L.A. in recent years,\nerecting Olympic + Hill\nrental tower with 685 units and 45,000 square feet of amenity space at 230 West Olympic Boulevard.\nIts other DTLA office assets include two buildings in South Park: the 12-story, 159,561-square-foot 315 West 9th Street and the five-story, 69,700-square-foot 1212 South Flower Street. It also owns the 17-story, 311,300-square-foot 600 Wilshire Boulevard in the Financial District.\n",

The company has grown rapidly since going public in June 2020: It now has 32,000 agents, almost triple its agent base of 12,000 that it\nreported\nat the end of 2023. In 2024,\nthe company added over $23 billion in transaction volume\n, second in growth only to\nCompass\n, according to RealTrends. Real Brokerage\ntouts its tech-first approach\n, rooting its business in its own proprietary software, reZEN.\nKeller Williams has a 70/30 commission split for every agent, while Real Brokerage has an 85/15 split, according to their websites.\nThe\nHouston Business Journal\nranked the Houston Properties Team fourth in the city among real estate teams last year for 2024 sales volume. The team completed over $163 million in volume that year with an average home price of $702,000.\nKeller Williams has recognized Paige Martin as a top five individual agent in the franchise. She also chairs the Houston Association of Realtors MLS Committee.\nBob Martin cited Real Brokerage\u2019s focus on technology as a draw for the Houston Properties Team, according to the press release.\nNeither Paige Martin nor Real Brokerage immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe team\u2019s move takes place as established companies weigh the benefits of branding and resources against independence. While the Compass/Anywhere merger consolidated\nsome of the top brands in Texas\nunder one company, others have doubled down on local management.\nKeller Williams recently lost the Jorgenson Group, a Central Texas team that opted to go independent earlier this month.

The portal is designed to cut down on the time it takes for developers to begin construction on\nstate-owned surplus property\n, according to the California Department of General Services.\n\u201cBy modernizing how we engage with developers, California is unlocking new opportunities for job creation and economic growth,\u201d Ana Lasso, director of the Department of General Services, said. \u201cThis portal ensures that state land is put to its best use while supporting diverse and emerging developers across the state.\u201d\nThrough the portal, developers can submit proposals to the Department of General Services, which the agency then evaluates according to the state\u2019s goals for the sites, which \u201cinclude successful implementation of the plan, financial return to the state and local regional impact,\u201d a department spokesperson told the Bee. Once a plan is approved, the developer would be responsible for building what they proposed if they\u2019re chosen.\nThe administration of\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nhas been working to turn government properties into affordable housing or other commercial properties. When Newsom first took office in 2019, one of his first announcements was a proposal to address California\u2019s need for more affordable housing by converting state property\nto residences\n. Last year, Newsom said his administration had 32 projects in \u201cvarious phases of development\u201d that would eventually result in nearly 4,300 housing units.\nLast November, state officials announced six new projects across California where more than 800 new homes will be built on state land. The new portal lets developers peruse the state\u2019s commercial opportunities.\nAs of Monday, 19 state properties were listed for possible commercial development, according to the Bee. Of the 19, 15 are available for proposal and one is already under agreement. Under the new program, developers will deal with simpler submission requirements and the Department of General Services can review proposals on a rolling basis, permitting projects to advance more quickly.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A year after succumbing to a massive loss on the sale of a marquee Chicago River office building, Sterling Bay is looking to offload a parking garage across the street as a potential apartment development site.\nThe Chicago-based developer hired JLL to market the five-story parking structure at 530 West Chicago Avenue, pitching the site as an apartment development opportunity amid intensifying interest along the river, according to a marketing brochure. JLL broker Dan Reynolds is representing the seller, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe garage sits just north of the Loop and spans about 30,725 square feet. JLL is advertising the site as suitable for a mid-rise or high-rise apartment project with as many as 400 units, depending on how much density a buyer can unlock through zoning and negotiations with neighboring owners.\nSterling Bay\nbought the garage in August 2018 for $15.5 million, Cook County records show. The decision to sell comes almost exactly a year after the firm unloaded the hulking office building at\n600 West Chicago Avenue\nfor about $88.7 million \u2014 a steep discount from the roughly $510 million it paid in early 2018 for the 1.6 million-square-foot\nformer Montgomery Ward warehouse\n, according to CoStar and public records.\nThe garage sale price will likely hinge on development rights. Under an existing reciprocal easement agreement with the adjacent garage at 811 North Larrabee Street \u2014 now owned by Arizona-based 3Edgewood after its purchase of the 600 West Chicago building \u2014 a buyer could build a 67-unit apartment building as-of-right. JLL\u2019s marketing materials note that changes to that agreement could allow a 175-unit tower under current zoning, while further negotiations could clear the way for a building with up to 400 apartments.\nAny project at 530 West Chicago Avenue would land in a rapidly transforming pocket of River North. Bally\u2019s casino is rising just across the river, while Onni Group is planning thousands of apartments nearby on and around a former Greyhound bus facility at the south end of Goose Island.\nThe listing also highlights the continued reshaping of Sterling Bay\u2019s portfolio after losing control of the\nLincoln Yards\nmegadevelopment and putting other properties in Fulton Market and near Lincoln Yards on the block.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nearly two years after the condo board at a Chicago high-rise terminated an agreement to sell their building to deconversion specialists Strategic Properties of North America, the firm came back with another offer \u2014 and was met with a resounding no.\nAfter buying dozens of condos in the 310-unit building in the Loop, SPNA offered $95 million to purchase all of the remaining units in a bulk sale in 2022. The Lakewood, New Jersey-based company, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, has made a name for itself in the high-stakes business of converting condo buildings into rental apartments.\nUnit owners at 200 North Dearborn Street initially agreed to the bulk sale to SPNA, but the firm failed to secure the financing necessary to close the deal, and condo owners were left in limbo for over two years. While the sale was pending, they were barred from selling their units individually, according to their agreement.\nThe condo board voted to terminate the contract in May 2024.\nWhen news of the second offer spread this week, the condo building\u2019s Facebook page lit up with condo owners criticizing SPNA.\n\u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. We cannot seriously go through this again,\u201d one member of the Facebook page wrote.\nThe deal was swiftly shot down.\nThe 200 North Dearborn condo board voted 4-0 to reject the offer, condo president Jonathan Taylor confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n, though he declined to disclose the amount offered.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as the offer that we were under contract for last time,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the condo board\u2019s bylaws, the board was tasked with evaluating the likelihood that fellow condo owners would support the offer in a building-wide vote. If the board was confident that the offer could get some traction, regardless of board members\u2019 individual opinions on the potential deal, they would agree to pay attorneys to draft a contract to present to all the condo owners for a vote, Taylor said. But after evaluating the terms of the offer, the board agreed it was likely to fail.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with them?\u201d another commenter on the Facebook page said, referring to SPNA. \u201cIf there are people who want to sell their units, do it when they get a good price \u2026. Leave the rest of us out of this slimy deconversion deal.\u201d\nKupperwasser and Klor did not respond to requests for comment.\nSPNA has successfully converted condo buildings in Chicago to rentals in the past. The cyclical business thrives when the condo market is oversupplied, and rent is on the rise.\nYet, since 2020, SPNA has fumbled three Chicago conversion deals, including the two offers to buy all the remaining units at 200 North Dearborn Street.\nThe third failed deal was\na $190 million offer\nto buy a River North condo building called Ontario Place. Initially, the building\u2019s condo board also agreed to the bulk sale. But after SPNA failed repeatedly over three years to secure the funding necessary to close the purchase, the board backed out of the deal. At the time, one condo owner called the waiting game, \u201chell for the past three years.\u201d\nAfter SPNA\u2019s first offer to buy all the units at 200 North Dearborn, tension escalated between condo owners who wanted to sell to SPNA and those who wanted to cut ties with the company, resulting in\na contentious condo board election\nin late 2023.\nIt also spurred\na lawsuit from\nTaylor, who alleged that SPNA had committed consumer fraud by making an offer it couldn\u2019t support. The case is currently pending in Illinois appeals court.\nSPNA\u2019s failed condo deconversions aren\u2019t the only setbacks the firm is facing.\nAttorneys for Chicago-based Byline Bank this month\nfiled a foreclosure complaint against SPNA\nfor a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAround the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nSPNA also recently sold a converted apartment building in Chicago at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group bought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month. SPNA last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA had converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont Avenue, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property.\nIn October, the company\nalso listed the K Square Apartments\nin Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "A federal civil rights investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into whether Texas state officials steered federal disaster relief grants to whiter, wealthier areas is now over.\nHUD\nclosed the case\ninvestigating the Texas General Land Office\u2019s practices in its distribution of disaster funding, according to a press release Wednesday from HUD. According to the agency, HUD\u2019s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity found that the Texas GLO did not engage in racial discrimination when making grant awards.\nThe move is the latest in a tug-of-war on policy spanning across three presidential terms to the present day. Former President Joe Biden\nreinstated a fair housing rule\nthat was scrapped by the Trump administration during his first term.\n\u201cThe Biden administration politicized enforcement of federal civil rights law and deprived rural communities of essential disaster mitigation funds,\u201d HUD Secretary\nScott Turner\nsaid in a statement. Turner was a Plano, Texas-based pastor prior to his confirmation in February for the HUD secretary chair.\nThe findings contradict the initial 2022 probe, which found that Texas didn\u2019t allocate any of the $1 billion in federal funds it received to protect communities from future disasters to any of the high-risk neighborhoods in Houston that experience regular flooding, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal,\nwith the agency going on to state that excluding Black and Hispanic communities was discriminatory.\nThe focus on Houston began with Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in 2017 and several costly storms in the following years that inundated the city. No other state adopted Texas\u2019 method of distributing the funds, according to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity under the prior administration. Without Texas\u2019 discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many Black residents and more than twice as many Hispanic residents would have benefited from the grants, according to the agency.\nThe state denied claims of discrimination and appealed HUD\u2019s findings, arguing that the Texas General Land Office administered the federal grant program based on HUD approval. The state pointed out that its plan was approved two years ago and even called HUD\u2019s objections \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\nTurner agreed, publishing an op-ed in the magazine National Review Jan. 19, outlining a new rule proposed by the agency to drop use of \u201cdisparate-impact theory\u201d in fair housing cases. According to a Library of Congress definition published in 2025,\ndisparate-impact\ndiscrimination is identified \u201cwhen a seemingly neutral policy or action causes a disproportionate and unjustified negative harm to a group, regardless of intent.\u201d\nHUD\u2019s statement reiterated that in the Texas GLO case, the state agency effectively used a race-neutral competition standard for disaster mitigation projects.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not the\nworst landlords\nlist. It\u2019s the\nworst\nlandlords list.\nWhat makes this annual hit piece by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams so bad? To begin with, not everyone on the list is a landlord.\nSome of them are\nreceivers\n\u2014 people appointed by a judge to rescue violation-ridden buildings. People like Joe Cafiero.\nThis is supposed to be a list of villains, but Cafiero is anything but. He arrives at a property with a pile of money from the lender, which is trying to protect its collateral, gets to know the residents and spends what it takes to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\u201cI walk every building,\u201d he said. \u201cTenants know my name. They have my cell number. They love me. We\u2019re doing what the owner didn\u2019t do. We\u2019re making it habitable again.\u201d\nWhen Cafiero is handed control of a building, it might have six or eight violations per unit. Violations are the basis of the public advocate\u2019s notorious list. But instead of shaming the owner who did not fix the problems, Williams\u2019 list blames people trying to do exactly that.\nThe list deemed Cafiero the landlord of\n19 distressed buildings\n. A random check of one, 1202 Spofford Avenue in the Bronx, showed it actually belonged to Isaac Kassirer, who famously assembled a huge rent-stabilized portfolio only to see the 2019 rent reform\ndestroy his business plan\n.\nThe building\u2019s $14.7 million mortgage included two other buildings, both assigned to Cafiero by a judge. The\nthree Kassirer properties\ntotal 106 units and 961 HPD violations, which Williams\u2019 list laid at the feet of Cafiero. Rather than using ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, the public advocate linked to\nJustFix.org\n, which partners with\ntenant organizing groups\n.\nDistress rising\nAs various factors pushed apartment buildings into\nfinancial straits\n, business skyrocketed for Cafiero, who has been at his firm, Cremac,\nsince 1994\n.\n\u201cWe take over two to four buildings a week,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year it was one every month, or every other month.\u201d\nAs a result, his ranking on the worst list of landlords shot up. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\u201cI was [No.] 24 last year; I\u2019m up to 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only because the volume of foreclosures has increased.\u201d\nThat, and the fact that the public advocate does not bother to differentiate between landlords and receivers.\nSometimes, as in the case of distinguished former judge\nAriel Belen\n, No. 34 on the list, clicking through to the associated properties shows he is a receiver, not the owner. Williams apparently did not even do that rudimentary check.\nThe public advocate\u2019s staff goes through the motions of informing people in advance that they will make the list, but does not appear to listen to feedback.\n\u201cThey sent us a letter about two months ago,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cI replied, told them we don\u2019t own [the buildings], that we\u2019re under receiver orders, but I guess it went ignored.\u201d\nProtests ignored\nCafiero said he even called the public advocate several times before the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list was released. But it generates more publicity than anything else the powerless office does, so each public advocate picks it up from the previous one. Before Jumaane Williams, there was Letitia James and the list\u2019s creator, Bill de Blasio.\n\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, I get it,\u201d Cafiero, a St. John\u2019s graduate, said of Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s grandstanding.\u201d\nWhen the list was released, media outlets started calling Cafiero, but no real estate publications did. They know better.\nThe Real Deal\nstopped covering the list years ago because it unfairly included owners who had just purchased troubled buildings and were in the process of fixing them up.\nNow it is increasingly roping in receivers because rent-stabilized buildings have been hit by a perfect storm:\nthe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which virtually banned deregulation and severely limited rent increases for improvements;\noperating expenses\noutpacing rent increases\nby the Rent Guidelines Board;\nrising interest rates starting in March 2022; and\na\ndecline in rent collection\ntriggered by the pandemic.\nThe \u201cworst landlords\u201d list is supposed to shame owners who squeeze profits from their buildings by not spending enough on maintenance. But it does not differentiate between them and owners who try hard to maintain properties, even if they lose money in the process.\nBecause of the rent laws, regulations and the dysfunction of housing court, the ownership costs of fully rent-stabilized buildings often exceed their revenue. Even mission-driven nonprofits that don\u2019t have to pay property tax are struggling at some properties.\n\u201cI\u2019ve literally lost $1.5 million for the honor of being a \u2018worst landlord,\u2019\u201d one member of the list said. \u201cIf I had to have the indignity of being on the list, I\u2019d at least want to make a buck.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Harwood International sold off another office building, amid a wave of\nsales\nand\nforeclosures\nat the firm\u2019s signature Uptown district.\nHarwood offloaded Harwood No. 3 to San Francisco-based private equity firm TPG on Dec. 1, deed records show. It\u2019s the fifth property\nHarwood sold to TPG\nin the last six months.\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street, was built in 1999. It\u2019s anchored by law firm Jones Day, which occupies 133,000 square feet of the 210,000-square-foot office building. Jones Day was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15, with plans to move into a\n73,000-square-foot block\n, but\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nAfter tapping Newmark to\nhunt for a recapitalization partner\n, Harwood sold four buildings to TPG last fall: Harwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nThe sales to TPG coincide with a spate of foreclosures in the district that resulted in Harwood losing two office buildings.\nHarwood handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nHarwood\nnearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January, but saved the building, known as Saint Ann Court, with a recapitalization deal.\nThe financial unraveling of Harwood is at odds with the health of the office market in Uptown. Though Dallas-Fort Worth continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n, Uptown has been a reliable outlier. With a high concentration of trophy office properties, the sought-after submarket accounts for nearly half of the region\u2019s office pipeline. Consequently, it also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

        "content": "Raphael De Niro is leaving Douglas Elliman after more than 20 years at the firm.\nDe Niro, who began his career at Elliman in 2004, is bringing his eight-person team to Brown Harris Stevens, according to an internal company memo sent by Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman on Thursday morning.\nDe Niro\u2019s has been a top-producing team at Elliman in New York City. In 2016, his team ranked first in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s annual broker rankings after closing over\n$720 million\nin sell-side deals. The team claims over $5.2 billion in sales since its inception, CEO Bess Freedman wrote in an announcement about the move.\nThe team works on both resale and new development projects. Past projects have included 108 Leonard, 111 Murray and 150 Charles. Recent noteworthy deals have included resales in those buildings, including a penthouse at\n111 Murray\nsold for $28 million in July and a condo at 150 Charles that sold for roughly $16 million this month.\nDe Niro\u2019s team also has the listing on another penthouse at 111 Murray asking over $33 million.\nHe also worked with his father, actor Robert De Niro, on expanding the family\u2019s real estate holdings. The younger De Niro was a partner and helped open the boutique Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca in 2008, and has been a part of the expansion of the upscale restaurant Nobu. Last year, the De Niros opened their\n775,000-square-foot production studio\nin Queens.\nDe Niro said in a statement he felt \u201cit was time to take my business in a new and different direction\u201d after 20 years at Elliman.\n\u201cWe are proud of the agent Raphael became with Elliman and wish him nothing but the best in his next endeavor,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nDe Niro is the latest in a long line of big-name Elliman agents who have left the firm.\nEarlier this month,\nLindsay Barton Barrett\n, one of the top brokers in Brooklyn, brought her four-person team to Compass. Top-producing teammates\nNoble Black\nand\nGlenn Davis\nparted ways with Elliman and each other last fall when Black left for Corcoran and Davis headed to Serhant.\nThe moves come as Elliman shuffles senior staff as well. The brokerage parted ways this month with its\nhead of residential leasing\n, Hal Gavzie, and last month, it laid off\nfour senior employees\n, including two members of its new development marketing arm.\nThe high-profile agents from Elliman have largely landed at Compass and Corcoran, but De Niro will be joining a fellow Elliman veteran at BHS. New York City agent\nJessica Cohen\nleft the firm in April after roughly 20 years for BHS.\n",

The store will occupy two floors of the property at 50 West 34th Street and is expected to open by the end of the year, representing the retailer\u2019s eighth Manhattan location.\nThe asking rent on the 10-year lease was a blended $4 million, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. In the fourth quarter, the average ground-floor retail asking rent on West 34th Street was $405 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJEMB\u2019s Jacob Jerome told the Observer that the deal reinforces \u201cthe corridor\u2019s role as one of the most important shopping districts in the country.\u201d\nRipco Real Estate\u2019s Richard Skulnik represented the tenant, while JEMB was represented in-house.\nThe lease brings occupancy at Herald Towers to 95 percent. Other tenants at the 110,000-square-foot property include Old Navy, MooMoo and IT Italian Trattoria.\nOld Navy, Gap Inc.\u2019s largest brand, agreed last spring to create a\n55,000-square-foot flagship\non the first and second floors of Herald Towers, the largest retail lease of the year in Manhattan at the time. The asking rent on the 15-year lease was not disclosed at the time.\nHerald Square has been slow to recover compared to other Manhattan retail corridors like SoHo and prime Fifth Avenue. The area along 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh avenues sported 21 ground-floor retail vacancies during the first quarter of last year, according to CBRE, the second-most among the 16 districts tracked by the brokerage.\nHerald Towers was once the McAlpin Hotel, but was rebranded after JEMB purchased the property in 1999 for $150 million. The property also includes 690 apartments, where a studio is asking $3,500 per month.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Long-stalled plans for nearly 1,000 residential units plus hotel rooms and commercial space near a West Palm Beach transit hub are back in motion.\nAttorneys for the developers behind the $1 billion Transit Village project are in discussions to settle the lawsuit against Palm Beach County over the sale price of the 6.6-acre county-owned site, avoiding a February trial, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n.\nCourt filings point to Palm Beach County Administrator Joseph Abruzzo, appointed last year to the job, for helping thaw the stalemate over the sale. The opposing sides \u201cbegan working together in good faith to try to amicably resolve this matter,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorneys wrote in filings.\nThe Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Michael Masanoff plan the 1.3 million-square-foot Transit Village at 150 Clearwater Drive in downtown West Palm. The project would rise atop a major city bus station and next to a transit hub for Tri-Rail and Amtrak trains and Greyhound buses.\nTransit Village had been in the works for 15 years when Masanoff won a city solicitation to redevelop the property. After stalling for years, it finally\npicked up momentum\nin 2021 when Related, BH and Sagi invested in the project.\nIn 2022, West Palm\napproved\nthe development with three 25-story buildings with 986 residential units, a fourth 25-story building with 108 hotel keys, and 180,000 square feet of offices. The project will include micro-units, workforce housing units, retail and an elevated podium.\nBut then Transit Village hit another hurdle when the developers\nsued\nthe county in 2024 over jacking up the site\u2019s price to $35.5 million, nearly 10 times more than the $3.6 million agreed on in 2012.\nIn court filings, the county said it wanted nearly $3 million in Federal Transit Administration grants repaid. But the county said the FTA wanted it repaid based on current property market values that put the amount owed for the grants at $35.5 million. Transit Village has argued the FTA never asked for the money back and the county contract never included a requirement to pay back the federal agency.\nReasons for previous delays prior to BH, Related and Sagi\u2019s investment are unclear. A source previously told\nThe Real Deal\nit had to do with numerous amendments to agreements with government agencies due to plan changes.\nAttorneys for the developers and a county spokesperson declined to comment to the outlet.\nA settlement would require approval at a public county meeting.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The asking price was later reduced to $7.8 million before being taken off the market in October, according to listing sites.\nMostame said after a relatively quiet 2025, he\u2019s seeing signs of \u201cactivity picking up\u201d and expects the property to trade before the summer now that buyers are back from their holiday travels.\nThe big jump in pricing from when the home last sold to London interior designer Julia Dempster is due to the extensive renovation it underwent. Dempster sought to retain the 1920s Spanish influence with the home\u2019s original arched doorways, stained glass windows and hand-painted ceilings, according to Mostame.\nIt sits on nearly a third of an acre and has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms across 5,906 square feet.\nThe residence was made a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1999, not only for its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, but its high-profile ownership lineage. That most recently came with Barker\u2019s purchase of the property in 1969. However, it was also once owned by former\nLos Angeles Times\nPublisher Harrison Gray Otis and later Charles Toberman, who is credited with building out Hollywood via developments such as the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and the Roosevelt Hotel among other landmarks.\nToberman is also the developer of the\nOutpost Estates\nneighborhood, an exclusive community of less than 500 homes known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. It\u2019s bordered by Mulholland Drive and Runyon Canyon.\n",

        "content": "A judge is blasting OYO Hotels for its actions at a Times Square hotel, where a\ndispute\nis raging between the company and its former manager, Highgate Hotels.\nOn Tuesday, a judge found OYO Hotels in contempt after violating a previous order, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The decision puts OYO on the hook for legal fees in the dispute, which could fall in the six-figure range when determined next week.\nThe judge pulled no punches in finding OYO in contempt for firing the property\u2019s manager and dozens of unionized employees, despite\nan order\nnot to do so.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what more you could do to be in contempt. I really don\u2019t,\u201d New York state Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said. \u201cThis is contempt if I ever saw it.\u201d\nThe judge also admonished OYO for not adhering to a contract that dictated how the company and Highgate would go their separate ways.\nOYO did not respond to a request for comment about the contempt finding or the dispute with Highgate.\nIn early August, OYO allegedly blindsided the property manager Highgate with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate. The cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe 10-year management agreement entitled Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate described as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nOYO disagreed with Highgate\u2019s characterization of performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it plans to welcome a new property manager, though at the moment, that property manager appears to be OYO.\nTerminating Highgate\u2019s contract could be a way for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before an expected initial public offering.\nOYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone for $525 million and is preparing an IPO that could value the company at $8 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The slowdown in demand for life sciences space is leading one of the Bay Area\u2019s biggest landlords in the sector to sell its land for residential use.\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities is\nplanning\nfor up to 35 percent of its $2.9 billion in asset sales this year to be land, with most of it poised for possible housing development, the San Francisco Business Times reported.\nThe Pasadena-based firm is already moving to offload some of its properties in the region. Alexandria is expected to\nput its 88 Bluxome Street site in San Francisco on the market\nin the first half of the year. The company has also begun marketing sites near Stanford University in Palo Alto for housing and is expected to sell the land within the next year.\nAlexandria saw almost $1.9 billion in write-downs last year, marking a nearly tenfold increase from 2024. With heightened surplus supply across the Bay Area, many developers are shying away from building new life sciences projects after the pre-pandemic biotech boom. Vacancy is approximately 24 percent, according to Savills data cited by the Business Times.\nLeasing in the life sciences market is picking up steam and some demand remains, according to the Business Times. Alexandria executives believe\nrecovery is coming\n, but it isn\u2019t moving fast enough to absorb excess supply. Rather than bet on life sciences, buyers for surplus land are instead looking to acquire property at lower prices and plan for housing instead.\nAn increasing portion of Alexandria\u2019s land and aging properties are now being positioned for housing upon sale, Peter Moglia, Alexandria\u2019s CEO and CIO, said. Much of Alexandria\u2019s recent write-downs were linked to land, a direct result of oversupply in the Bay Area and other parts of the country, Marc Binda, Alexandria\u2019s CFO noted.\nSome Alexandria-owned land is being primed for housing without even selling. Last month, Strada Investment Group unveiled a\nproposal to demolish\nfour office buildings on Alexandria-owned land in Palo Alto to make way for 145 residential units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Four years after topping out Brooklyn\u2019s office skyline, JEMB Realty pulled off a financial reset at 1 Willoughby Square, bringing in partners and refinancing a tangle of construction-era debt to keep control of the 35-story tower.\nThe 500,000-square-foot Downtown Brooklyn building was recapitalized through a complex transaction that included new equity, splitting the tower into condos and a $125 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank, according to\nBisnow\nand a recent Fitch Ratings report.\nAmong the latest round of investors is Edmond Safra, a member of the Safra banking family, alongside Adnane Mousannif\u2019s AVRS Partners and KSR Capital principals Abraham Kassin and Morris Sabbagh.\nThe Deutsche loan is tied to the lower portion of the building and includes a $75 million A-note sold into a CMBS conduit. JEMB executives Joseph, Morris, Jacob and Louis Jerome are listed as sponsors on the financing, along with the new partners.\nThe sponsors also kicked in $68.5 million in fresh equity, according to Fitch, used largely to retire $179.5 million of existing debt, cover closing costs and seed a nearly $10 million reserve.\nAs part of the deal, the tower was split into two condo units: floors one through 21 and floors 22 through 35. Only the lower unit carries the Deutsche debt, while the upper floors are debt-free for now. Fitch flagged the layered capital stack as a potential risk, noting remaining EB-5 mezzanine debt and $65 million in convertible loans tied to the joint venture.\nJEMB said the building is being repositioned with a spec suite program, including prebuilt offices as large as 10,000 square feet. The landlord recently signed CorePower Yoga to a 5,000-square-foot flagship retail lease on the ground floor and expanded Rubenstein Law into a 10,000-square-foot office on the 21st floor.\nThe recap comes against a tough backdrop for Brooklyn offices.\nDowntown Brooklyn\u2019s vacancy rate stood at 21.1 percent at the end of the third quarter, well above the citywide average, Fitch reported. The Willoughby Square tower is 53.5 percent occupied, though the portion tied to the CMBS loan is nearly full, anchored by the city\u2019s Albee Square Montessori Public School, which leases 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mark Nussbaum, a disgraced Manhattan attorney and real estate fixer, said in new legal filings that he diverted $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner between 2022 and 2025.\nThe filings reveal the inner workings of Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s alleged Ponzi scheme, where some creditors were offered \u201cfictitious investment opportunities regarding supposed proof of funds transactions or purchases of real property that did not really exist,\u201d said Nussbaum.\n\u201cPhony emails, escrow agreements, and deal documentation were used; non-existent third-parties in whose names the deals were supposedly being done were invented,\u201d the filings state.\nNussbaum said that most of his escrow clients, who are now creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s estate, were introduced to him by Steiner, who died by suicide at a hotel in Manhattan in January 2025 as the alleged scheme was about to spill into public view. Nussbaum Lowinger shut down days later and lawsuits started piling up from escrow clients demanding their money back.\nShelden Eisenberger, the lawyer handling the liquidation process \u2014 known as assignment for the benefit of creditors \u2014 of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates, is zeroing in on the transfers to Steiner\u2019s family in an attempt to recoup the hundreds of millions owed to Nussbaum\u2019s creditors.\nThe new filings paint the clearest picture to date of the money flow between Nussbaum and Steiner and his family. Nussbaum said he directly transferred about $24 million to Steiner or to companies controlled by members of his family.\nIn addition to direct transfers, Nussbaum transferred escrow money to Steiner\u2019s companies Aven Realty and Real Green Management. Those companies then transferred at least $68 million to companies controlled by Steiner\u2019s father, brother and wife, according to Eisenberger.\nTo compensate Nussbaum for his role in the scheme, Aven Realty and Real Green sent $104 million, according to Eisenberger\u2019s affirmation.\nEisenberger said he does not yet have access to all of Aven Realty and Real Green\u2019s books and records. But his legal team has been able to document some transfers.\nThis includes $4.3 million to DS Lending, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s wife Dini Endzweig Steiner; $361,500 to Olivii, a clothing company owned by Dini; $6.4 million to 365 12th Avenue LLC, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s brother Naftali; and $6.7 million to 198 President Realty LLC, another company owned by Naftali Steiner.\nEisenberger is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent Aven Realty or Real Green from transferring any assets.\nHe notes recovery efforts are on behalf of 52 creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s who lost a significant amount of money as a result of the alleged ponzi scheme.\n\u201cSome of those creditors are themselves threatened with insolvency as a result of those losses,\u201d said Eisenberger in his affirmation. \u201cThis is a very important case and this is an urgent matter.\u201d\nThe filings also explicitly lay out how Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s Ponzi\nscheme\nworked. Nussbaum and Steiner pitched three types of investments to possible investors. One offered clients high monthly fees in exchange for deposits into Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts. The money was supposed to be held in escrow but was instead used by Steiner to\nshow\nlenders or sellers that he was capitalized. The second method was through fraudulent real estate purchases, where Steiner provided Nussbaum\u2019s clients a chance to finance his real estate acquisitions or deposit. The third was by offering clients a chance to deposit money for a short-time in exchange for \u201cexorbitant interest and fees.\u201d The money was supposed to be used for \u201cshow capital\u201d transactions. Instead, Nussbaum used the money to make\nbridge loans\nto real estate dealmakers.\n",

        "content": "Texas homebuyers love master-planned communities so much that 20 of the 50 top-sellers were in the state in 2025.\nThe Houston region dominated the national ranking in particular, with Sunterra and Tamarron \u2014 both in Katy \u2014 landing in the top 10, according to data from real estate consultancy RCLCO. Houston\u2019s suburbs had 10 master-planned communities land in the 50 top-selling MPCs in total last year. Developers Land Tejas and Starwood Land\u2019s\nSunterra\nnotched the highest sales in the state with 1,024 last year. D.R. Horton\u2019s Tamarron inked 974 home sales.\nBuilders competed with a rising supply of resale homes, and many buyers remained sidelined by elevated mortgage rates,\naccording\nto the Houston Chronicle. Despite the broader trend,\ngains were posted\nin several developments across the Houston metro. Across the state as a whole, the only other state to come close to Texas\u2019 tally of top-performing master-planned communities was Florida, with 16.\nSunterra\u2019s 2,300 acres includes resort-style amenities that might serve as the extra incentive attracting new residents, such as a\ncrystal lagoon\nthat opened last year along a 2.7-acre white sand manmade beach, according to the outlet. Resident-only perks also include a pool and lazy river, splash pad and walking trails, all within zoning for Katy Independent School District and parts in Royal ISD.\nTodd LaRue, a Texas-based managing director at RCLCO, told the outlet that he expects Houston\u2019s master-planned communities to outperform the rest of the U.S. in 2026.\n\u201cIt is unlikely to be dethroned as the \u2018Top-Selling Metro Area\u2019 for master-planned communities in the near future,\u201d LaRue said.\nNot to be outdone,\nOxland Group\u2019s\nPainted Tree development in McKinney was the top Dallas-Fort Worth metro MPC to land on the list, with 643 home sales. The development, 30 miles north of Dallas and west of I-75, includes three districts surrounding wooded lakes and parks. In Denton County, D.R. Horton\u2019s Silverado development, at 2604 O\u2019Connell Circle in Aubrey, sold 446 homes, according to the data.\nRounding out the Texas Triangle, the San Antonio community of Riverstone \u2014 another D.R. Horton development \u2014 sold 529 homes. Riverstone is near the Far West Side Alamo Ranch and Loop 1604 Hwy 151 corridor. Platform Ventures and Capitol Realty\u2019s master-planned community of Santa Rita Ranch just north of Austin in Liberty Hill sold 483 homes, according to RCLCO.\n",

We could also see a new version emerge. Before the latest version was passed by the City Council in December, the bill\u2019s applicability was narrowed. Will a resurrected COPA apply to a bigger pool of buildings, now that it has an ally in the mayor?\nEither way, the fight over this bill isn\u2019t over. The city\u2019s Law Department flagged legal concerns with the latest version of the measure, and landlord groups have already floated litigation if the bill ultimately becomes law.\nIn a statement, Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, reiterated her group\u2019s opposition to the measure, calling it an \u201cunlawful taking of private property.\u201d\n\u201cThankfully, enough Council members understood the devastating ramifications of COPA and eliminated any possibility of the Council overriding the former Mayor\u2019s veto,\u201d she said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I\u2019ve asked this before, but still would love an answer: Who will the mayor select to lead the Department of City Planning? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Yume Kitasei, the\nnew head of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services\n, has two cats named Boondoggle and Filibuster, according to her\nauthor page\n. These are the best cat names I have ever heard, and I will not be persuaded otherwise.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday blamed his predecessor and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo for what his administration estimated is a $12 billion budget gap,\nGothamist reports\n. He ramped up his calls to increase income taxes on the city\u2019s highest earners (which would require state legislation). Representatives for the former mayor and governor disputed the mayor\u2019s claims.\n\u2014 Construction on the $16 billion Gateway tunnel project will screech to a halt in February if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t release funding,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The Gateway Development Commission has kept construction going, up until this point, thanks to a $500 million line of credit from Bank of America that is running out.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$19.8 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The condo unit at The Aman is 3,400 square feet. The property was reportedly sold by\nthe developer\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$112.3 million\nfor 250 East Houston Street. Atlas Capital Group\npurchased\nthe 130-unit, multifamily building from Rockwood Capital.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $8 million for a penthouse unit at 456 West 19th Street. The Chelsea condo is 2,800 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nJustin Hopwood, Adrian Radomski and Nicholas Lounsbury are the listing agents.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 171,415-square-foot, eight-story, mixed-use building at 1111 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.

        "content": "A Long Island investor who leaned on pandemic-era stopgaps to keep Midtown hotels afloat has now lost both properties.\nParamdeep Singh, who owns gas stations and operated the hotels through Premier Hotels, was stripped of control\nat 59 West 46th Street\nand 129 West 46th Street after defaults, foreclosure actions and investor infighting, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nAt 59 West 46th Street, a nine-story, 234-room hotel just off Sixth Avenue, Singh was undone by a former partner-turned-lender. Boris Aronov, a cab driver who later became a Diamond District diamond dealer, acquired the building\u2019s distressed mortgage last summer and then moved to foreclose when Singh failed to repay the debt by the end of the year. Court filings show the obligation had swelled to $57 million.\nThe deed, recorded last week, pegs the property\u2019s value at roughly $53 million, below the $59.5 million Singh\u2019s group paid for the hotel in 2022 when it bought it from Apple Core. That acquisition was heavily leveraged with more than $32 million in debt.\nOnce a budget-brand flag, the hotel more recently functioned as supportive housing under a nonprofit lease that is expected to remain in place.\nAronov is also eyeing a different future for part of the building: the property spans through to 47th Street, where he plans to bring in diamond merchants, extending his jewelry-focused portfolio in the neighborhood.\nSingh tried to stop the takeover in court, accusing Aronov of bad-faith tactics and arguing that international trade policies \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 scuttled a last-minute refinancing. The effort failed.\nA few doors east, Singh\u2019s grip recently loosened at 129 West 46th Street, a 79-room prewar hotel he bought in 2019 for $24 million. When tourism collapsed, Singh pivoted the building into a city-contracted migrant shelter, generating steady cash flow but complicating long-term repositioning.\nA\nplanned revival\nwith hotel operator LuxUrban fizzled and the operator\u2019s bankruptcy cleared the way for foreclosure. A judge entered a $21.6 million judgment last fall and the property sold at auction this month to bridge lender W Financial for $23.8 million.\nInvestor lawsuits accusing Singh of mismanagement and opaque finances added pressure behind the scenes. Singh did not comment on the loss of the hotels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Bucktown strip mall could soon give way to a mid-rise apartment building, as a longtime local owner moves to redevelop a prominent stretch of Milwaukee Avenue.\nBroker-developer\nBill Senne\nintroduced a zoning change request to Chicago City Council for a seven-story, 60-unit apartment building at 1704 North Milwaukee Avenue, replacing a low-rise shopping center he has owned for decades, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The proposal calls for ground-floor retail, two levels of parking and apartments above.\nThe site currently houses a Garfield\u2019s Beverage Express liquor store and a CorePower Yoga studio, along with a surface parking lot across the street from the\nBucktown\n-Wicker Park library. Under the latest plans, the new building would include nearly 11,000 square feet of retail space along\nMilwaukee Avenue\n. Both tenants have expressed interest in returning after construction, according to Senne.\nPlans submitted to the city show 60 apartments spread across the upper floors, including a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units, plus two studios. Twelve apartments would be designated affordable to comply with city requirements. A two-level parking garage on the second and third floors would provide 67 spaces, with 12 reserved for residents and the remainder available as paid public parking.\nThe parking count is down sharply from earlier iterations. According to the publication, Senne, president of Chicago-based brokerage\nProperty Consultants Realty\n, and his team first presented the project to neighbors in early September, when plans called for roughly 100 spaces. Since then, the development has added two units and trimmed parking, though the building\u2019s exterior design has stayed the same.\n\u201cThe changes we made prior to filing are reflected on the floor plans, but the building\u2019s exterior elevations and massing stayed the same,\u201d zoning attorney Nicholas Ftikas said in an email to the outlet.\nThe zoning change was formally introduced to the City Council last week. It still needs approval from the Council\u2019s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards, followed by a vote of the full council. The timing is uncertain: The zoning committee hasn\u2019t met since December as aldermen jockey to become its permanent chair, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n, and a February meeting has yet to be scheduled.\nCommunity reaction has been mostly supportive, according to the outlet, based on meetings hosted by the Wicker Park Committee and Bucktown Community Organization last fall. Some residents raised concerns about the building\u2019s height and potential traffic impacts on Wabansia Avenue and nearby streets.\nSenne has argued the parking garage would help replace spaces lost when protected bike lanes were added to Milwaukee Avenue. According to Block Club, Senne told neighbors in September that he was framing the garage as both a business necessity and a neighborhood amenity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Alan Stalcup says collapsing multifamily fundamentals \u2014 not alleged fraud \u2014 are to blame for a string of failed investments by the syndicator that have landed his firm in court.\nStalcup, CEO of Austin-based apartment investor and operator GVA Property Management, pushed back in an\ninterview\nwith the Austin Business Journal on claims made by Austin-based investor Bryan Kastleman, who has accused GVA and its leadership of falsifying financials and\nsiphoning money\nfor personal use. Kastleman said he invested $11.3 million across several GVA deals and alleges the firm\n\u201ccooked the books\u201d\nto obtain and refinance loans, according to a lawsuit filed last year. GVA and Stalcup have denied the allegations and countersued Kastleman for defamation and business disparagement, among other claims.\nStalcup is also named in a lawsuit from New York-based private lender Benefit Street Partners in February 2025, and in January the Securities and Exchange Commission announced an investigation alleging he misappropriated as much as\n$100 million from investors\n.\nWith the suits and countersuits gearing up in court, Stalcup is publicly laying out a different explanation for GVA\u2019s unraveling: a brutal mix of rising interest rates, inflation and a wave of new apartment supply that crushed values across the Sun Belt, according to the publication.\nFrom the early 2010s through the pandemic, GVA\u2019s strategy of buying older apartment complexes, renovating them and boosting rents worked, Stalcup told the outlet. That changed around 2022, when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively while simultaneously valuations in some markets fell by as much as 40 percent.\n\u201cNot only do the valuations go down, but debt service went up, and we\u2019re fighting costs of inflation, labor, property tax and insurance,\u201d Stalcup said. \u201cThen supply really kicked in in 2023 and 2024.\u201d\nThe oversupply problem in markets such as Austin is well documented. Patton Jones, vice chairman of Newmark\u2019s Central Texas office, told the outlet that the region entered 2024 with roughly 50,000 units in the development pipeline after years of pandemic-fueled in-migration to Sun Belt cities. That surge drove rents down just as borrowing costs spiked, a one-two punch for leveraged apartment owners.\nThose conditions, Stalcup said, hit GVA especially hard because of timing. The firm bought roughly $4 billion worth of real estate, with about 80 percent of the portfolio acquired post-pandemic, characterizing his firm\u2019s purchases of older apartments as all underwater.\nGVA defaulted on multiple loans in San Antonio, including at\nSolara\n, Bella Madera and Melia Apartment Homes, and sold other properties below assessed values. The firm also shrank the total number of is managed apartments from a peak of about 30,000 units to roughly 5,000 today.\nSince 2023, GVA has pursued sales, equity recaps and negotiations with lenders, though Stalcup said many lenders were unwilling to modify loans, paving the way for foreclosures. Still, he said the firm continues to operate with about 150 employees and a stabilized core portfolio.\nThe truth of Kastleman\u2019s allegations \u2014 and GVA\u2019s counterclaims \u2014 will ultimately be decided in court. For now, Stalcup said his firm is waiting out debt maturities, hoping values rebound before a major tranche of loans comes due around 2028.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Concord Wilshire Capital is first in line to buy a distressed development site in Royal Palm Beach that\u2019s approved for a mixed-use project but saddled with a $47.4 million foreclosure judgment.\nTwo entities managed by developer\nBrian Tuttle\nare seeking bankruptcy court approval for a reorganization plan that entails two possible tracks to pay off the foreclosure.\nIn one scenario, Miami-based Concord, led by Nate Sirang, would buy the 38-acre property for $60 million, a Jan. 23 motion shows.\nIf Concord\u2019s purchase fails, Tuttle\u2019s two entities would be consolidated and acquired by Coral Gables-based The Ardent Companies, which would then pay the mortgage debt, according to the reorganization plan.\nAn affiliate of Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group won a final judgment against the Tuttle entities in a 2024 foreclosure lawsuit alleging the developer defaulted on three loans totaling\n$38.4 million\n.\nThe site within the 200-acre Tuttle Royale master planned community, on the southwest corner of U.S. 441 and Southern Boulevard, was set to be sold at a foreclosure auction on Sept. 24. But the day before the auction, the\nTuttle entities\nfiled chapter 11 petitions in Miami bankruptcy court.\nSince then, the amount owed to Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse, led by Eyal Peretz, has ballooned to $60.1 million including accrued interest and fees, bankruptcy filings show.\nTuttle has not started construction on the project, known as The Mainstreet at Tuttle. The development was planned with 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, 400,000 square feet of retail, 82,900 square feet of offices and 3,435 parking spaces. The property is among\n13 South Florida development sites\nthat have fallen into distress since 2024.\nRepresentatives for the Tuttle entities, Fuse Group, Concord and Ardent did not respond to requests for comment.\nFuse initially sought to dismiss the bankruptcy petitions by alleging in a motion that Tuttle filed for chapter 11 to stall the auction. In November, Fuse, Tuttle and Ardent representatives attended a settlement conference in which they hashed out the terms of the reorganization plan.\nIf the sale to Concord goes through, $1.8 million would pay unsecured creditors, $471,000 would pay delinquent property taxes, and an undetermined amount would pay attorney fees for the Tuttle entities, the Jan. 23 motion states. The balance would pay off Fuse.\nIf the deal falls through, Ardent would pay Fuse $50 million after acquiring the unified Tuttle entity. Tuttle would also remain as a personal guarantor to the\nFuse\nloans. The largest unsecured creditors include another lender that is owed $7.8 million and BC Architects, which is owed $1.5 million in fees, bankruptcy court filings show.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Erik Kimball is set to rule on the reorganization plan on Friday.",

        "content": "A pair of adjacent properties in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills has traded hands for about $25 million, a deal that sets a recent high-water mark of roughly $1,500 per square foot, according to property records dated early January.\nThe deal involves legacy wealth and newer found fortune in Los Angeles. The seller is connected to Anderson Real Estate, a private, family-owned real estate company. Anderson Real Estate is linked to Topa Equities \u2014 founded by late billionaire and Los Angeles businessman John Anderson, who has a University of California, Los Angeles, school named after him. The buyer is connected to David Mirharooni, a real estate investor via his Brickstar Capital, business records reveal.\nMirharooni, who is chair of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment. Anderson Real Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Golden Triangle trade encompasses two adjacent parcels that combine for about 16,400 feet at 202 North Canon Drive, a one-story home to Rodeo Realty, and 208 North Canon Drive, which can be used for office or retail. Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs and Gavin Ketchum brokered the off-market transaction; Luchs confirmed the trade.\nA person familiar with the matter said the buy isn\u2019t necessarily an office play, and the new owner might want to eventually tap its retail use.\nBeverly Hills prices fall into a different category for retail located directly on the famed high-end shopping strip of Rodeo Drive, where a property leased to Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga\nsold\nfor $400 million-plus, which amounted to more than $14,000 per square foot.\nThe deal on Canon is nevertheless pricey given its location and the current office market conditions in areas beyond Rodeo. It commanded more on a square-footage basis than publicly traded real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\u2019s $200 million-plus Beverly Hills office campus\nbuy\nfrom Tishman Speyer last year, which came to around $700 per square foot. Mirharooni\u2019s deal is also pricier per square foot than Alo Yoga\u2019s $90 million\npurchase\nof a Beverly Hills headquarters that came out to almost $1,100 a square foot late last year.\nBrickstar Capital\u2019s Mirharooni and Daniel Mirharooni recently made another Beverly Hills buy: a retail property on South Robertson Boulevard for almost $8 million, or $985 per square foot, Traded L.A.\nreported\n. The Mirharoonis own Mastro\u2019s on Canon Drive.\nAnderson Real Estate, chaired by Patrick Haden, owns properties throughout the city, including two office towers on Century City\u2019s Avenue of the Stars and another in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle on Wilshire Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Indiana senators took a step toward luring the Chicago Bears across state lines, approving legislation that would set up the legal and financial scaffolding for a new NFL stadium in northwest Indiana.\nIn a 46-2 vote on Tuesday, the Indiana Senate passed Senate Bill 27, which would create the Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority \u2014 a quasi-public entity empowered to issue bonds, acquire land, finance construction and lease a stadium to a private team, the Indianapolis Business Journal\nreported\n. The bill, authored by Republican Sens. Ryan Mishler and Chris Garten, now heads to the House.\nMishler stressed that the legislation stops short of sealing a deal, but rather creates a framework around how ongoing negotiations with the Bears will work, according to the publication.\nIn a December interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the team is looking across state lines. Officials in the southeast Chicago suburbs on the Indiana side of the metro of Hammond and Gary have floated concepts so far.\nThe vote does signal Indiana\u2019s intent as it\npositions itself\nagainst Illinois, where the Bears have\ngrown frustrated by stalled talks\nwith Gov. JB Pritzker and state lawmakers over a long-discussed stadium project tied to the team\u2019s suburban Arlington Heights\nracetrack site\n. The Bears have played at Soldier Field in Chicago since 1971, but have openly floated alternatives.\nThe team welcomed the Senate action in a statement, calling it a positive step forward for Bears fans across\nChicagoland\n.\nUnder SB 27, the stadium authority would effectively stand in for the state as the owner of a new facility. Its three-member board would be composed of top state budget and finance officials, according to the outlet. The authority could issue 40-year bonds to fund land acquisition and construction, with repayment tied to rent, insurance proceeds and other pledged revenues. Any deal would require the Bears to commit to a 35-year lease.\nWhile the authority would own the stadium, the team would cover operating and repair costs and keep stadium-generated revenue. The Bears could buy the venue outright by assuming remaining debt \u2014 or for $1 once the bonds are fully paid.\nSome issues were left intentionally unresolved, including local tax arrangements and adding municipal representation to the authority, the outlet reported. A proposed requirement for minority business participation goals was stripped out during committee review.\nThe House is expected to take up the bill next. Speaker Todd Huston voiced support, but wants a firm commitment from the Bears before anything is finalized.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Donald Bren\u2019s firm, Irvine Company, might be preparing to test how much market appetite remains for top-tier office buildings in downtown Chicago.\nThe Newport Beach, California-based firm is moving toward a potential sale of the 50-story tower at\n1 North Wacker Drive\n, according to sources familiar with the matter and first\nreported\nin Crain\u2019s. Irvine recently interviewed brokerage teams and tapped Eastdil Secured to conduct a strategic review of the 1.4 million-square-foot skyscraper. Should Irvine formally list the tower, it would be the company\u2019s first Chicago office sale since it entered the market in 2010.\nEastdil Managing Director Bryan Rosenberg confirmed to the publication that the firm was retained, but said the property has not been listed.\nAny sale would be closely watched, as\ndowntown office values\nhave been battered by recent market conditions. But the tower at 1 North Wacker possesses a lot to work with,\u00a0 such as a prime riverfront address, strong cash flow and a roster of blue-chip tenants, according to the outlet.\nThe tower generated $47.2 million in net operating income in 2023, according to Bloomberg data tied to its $353 million commercial mortgage-based securities mortgage, which Irvine put in place during a 2021 refinancing. The building was appraised at $664 million at the time.\nThe tower would likely trade far above recent Chicago office deals, many of which involved distressed or sparsely leased properties. Just a couple blocks south, towers at 125 and 200 South Wacker Drive sold last year for under $100 per square foot.\nIrvine, led by the 93-year-old billionaire\nBren\n, has long cultivated a reputation as a patient, long-term holder. In Chicago, the firm also owns the building at 71 South Wacker Drive and last year paid off a $431 million loan on its tower at 300 North LaSalle Street, signaling staying power. But the company has shown it will sell when the timing suits it, having unloaded its\nentire downtown San Diego office portfolio\nover the past two years.\nWhile downtown Chicago office vacancy sits at about 28 percent, 1 North Wacker is roughly 92 percent leased, according to CoStar. Trophy buildings citywide are faring much better than the broader market, with vacancy closer to 11 percent, Colliers data shows.\nThe tower has also proven resilient post-pandemic. PricewaterhouseCoopers signed a 10-year lease extension last year for more than 282,000 square feet, pushing its term to 2038, while Barnes &amp; Thornburg expanded and extended its lease through 2036. Irvine also recently poured $10 million into upgrading the building\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The locally based nutrition company occupies 118,767 square feet at the EmeryTech campus.\nEmeryTech is currently 66.9 percent occupied, according to the Business Times. The complex has undergone more than $37.9 million in capital improvements, including upgrades to HVAC tech and solar panel installation. On-site amenities include fitness center, rock-climbing gym, showers, outdoor patios and cafeteria.\nAn eventual offloading of the property is expected to be a short sale, meaning it would sell for less than the balance of the debt linked to the property, a source familiar with the site told the Business Times. Such a transaction would resemble other office property sales in Emeryville.\nIn September, LBA Realty bought a 16-story, 350,000-square-foot office building at\n2100 Powell Street\nfor $72.5 million, or $200 per square foot, representing a 57.6 percent drop from the $170.9 million that CBRE Investment Management paid for it in 2018. The $72.5 million transaction price was also a short sale, according to the Business Times. If the EmeryTech property were to be sold at $200 per square foot, the purchase price would total approximately $47 million, per the Business Times.\nAnother Emeryville property once owned by Blackstone also traded hands last year.\nSutter Health bought\na 12-acre life sciences campus in the East Bay city from Blackstone\u2019s\nBioMed Realty\nfor $450 million, or $615 per square foot, with plans to turn the site into a 1.3-million-square hospital and medical center.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A 12,000-acre\nPanhandle\nranch\nformerly owned by the late oil magnate T. Boone Pickens\n, traded last month, closing a choppy chapter in the property\u2019s history.\nMesa Vista Ranch LLC, owned by a group of investors that includes Midland oilman Bailey Peyton and Georgia-based investor J. Bradford Smith, sold the MV2 Ranch in Roberts County to Botas Rotas LLC, owned by Southlake businessman Tim Cummings, according to public records.\nSpanning 12,061 contiguous acres, the property includes several improvements designed to support game, especially quail. A seven-mile water line operates constantly with sprinkler heads set every thousand feet, and the land\u2019s position above the Ogallala Aquifer offers the potential for up to 50 new water wells, according to the listing.\nRepublic Ranches agent Bryan Pickens \u2014 no relation to the late corporate raider and wildcatter \u2014 had the listing. The final sale price is undisclosed, but the property was listed for $16.5 million, almost $1,400 per acre. It was originally listed for $19.6 million last spring.\nThe original Mesa Vista Ranch grew from an initial 2,900-acre purchase Boone Pickens made in 1971. Over the next four decades, the ranch swelled to more than 64,000 acres and improved into a luxury hunting destination, served by an FAA-approved airport and anchored by a 25,000-square-foot mansion dubbed \u201cthe Lodge,\u201d according to published reports. When Pickens decided to list the property in 2017 for $250 million,\nit was the most expensive property on the market in the country\n.\nAfter several price cuts, the Mesa Vista Ranch\nsold\nin 2022 within 10 percent of its final asking price of $170 million, according to\nLand Report\n. Oil investor Bill Kent bought 36,000 acres that included the mansion. A rancher named Travis Chester bought the portion that would become the MV2 Ranch, which he sold to Mesa Vista Ranch LLC in 2023.\nThe company quickly landed in a\nlegal squabble over Pickens\u2019 prestige\n. Kent\u2019s company filed a lawsuit alleging that Peyton and Smith formed Mesa Vista Ranch LLC to flip the 12,000 acres. By using the Mesa Vista name in their marketing materials, the lawsuit claimed, Peyton and Smith misrepresented their largely unimproved acreage as part of the luxurious resort Pickens created. The suit was resolved in\nApril\nwhen Peyton and Smith agreed not to use the Mesa Vista name in their marketing.\nBryan Pickens\u2019 ambitious listing campaign included a video produced last spring in which executives from the outdoor lifestyle magazine \u201cField and Stream\u201d hunted and camped on the ranch with country singer Ben Roberts.",

        "content": "The City Council on Thursday overrode a bevy of mayoral vetoes, including measures that set new restrictions on what types of housing the city finances.\nThe Council reversed 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\n, most of which he made on his last day in office. That\u2019s more than the number of vetoes voided by the Council over the last decade, according to Speaker Julie Menin.\nTwo of those\nmeasures\nset minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units financed by the city, which housing groups argued would interfere with the new mayor\u2019s housing agenda. The Council overrode vetoes on several other real estate-related measures, including one that sets minimum wages for building security officers.\nThe Council, however, didn\u2019t override Adams\u2019 veto of the industry-derided Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\nNew unit requirements\nOne of the bills revived by the Council requires that over a five-year period, at least 4 percent of new housing units financed by the city must be homeownership units. That requirement goes into effect on July 1, 2026.\nAnother measure mandates that at least 50 percent of new units funded by the city be affordable for extremely low-income households (those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income) and very low-income households (those earning no more than 50 percent AMI). At least 30 percent must be affordable to extremely low-income households. Those thresholds apply over a five-year period and kick in July 1, 2027.\nThe Adams administration estimated that those bills would cost $110 million each year to maintain the city\u2019s current level of housing production and preservation. Though the administration argued against the cost of these and other bills, the mayor didn\u2019t veto a measure that sets minimum construction wages on city-funded housing projects, which his administration estimated would cost more than $400 million annually.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani had voiced concerns about the bills that set minimum thresholds for city-financed housing and their potential effect on his goal to build 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade.\nA representative for the mayor didn\u2019t immediately comment on the two measures being revived by the City Council on Thursday.\nSome bills remain vetoed\nSome of Adams\u2019 housing-related vetoes, however, weren\u2019t revived. The Council didn\u2019t override the mayor\u2019s veto of another housing regulation bill that would set a minimum percentage of city-financed units with two- and three-bedrooms.\nIt also became clear early this week that COPA\ndidn\u2019t garner enough votes\nto overrule Adams\u2019 veto. Still, progressive Council members, the speaker and the mayor appear determined to revive the measure.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s meeting, Menin acknowledged that bills vetoed by Adams that were not resuscitated by the Council still have a path forward \u201cwhere we can get a supermajority support and address legal issues.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s Law Department flagged constitutional issues around COPA, which would have given city-approved non-profits, as well as joint ventures between for- and not-for-profit firms, the first opportunity to bid on certain distressed multifamily buildings when their owners decide to sell.\nCouncil member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, has\nmade clear\nthat she plans to reintroduce the measure.\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: if we do not have stronger protections to keep working class New Yorkers here, they will continue to leave,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to working with Speaker Menin on re-introducing the bill and passing it this year.\u201d\nAdditional overrides\nThe Council overrode Adams\u2019 veto of a bill that sets\nminimum wages\nfor office security guards, a change proposed after the fatal shootings at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue last year. The Real Estate Board of New York has raised concerns about the bill, arguing that it undermines labor negotiations and is barred by state law.\nThe body additionally revived a measure aimed at increasing transparency around the co-op application process. Under the measure,\nco-op boards\nmust notify prospective residents that they have received an application to live at a building within 15 days. The board then has 45 days to accept or reject the application.\nThe Council reversed the former mayor\u2019s vetoes of bills that would create a city-run land bank (as long as the state approves it) and allow the city to sell tax liens to the land bank, rather than a private trust.\n",

        "content": "It only took three months for a new record sale on the North Fork.\nA waterfront Southold property at 59600 Main Road closed for $12.4 million, the highest price achieved for a single-lot on Long Island\u2019s North Fork. A bayfront home in Cutchogue sold by the estate of the late gallerist Barbara Gladstone held the previous record after its\n$11.2 million\nsale in October.\nThe Gladstone property, which spans 1.2 acres and works out to over $9 million per acre, still dwarfs the recent Southold one in terms of price per acre.\nThe Southold property spans over 21 acres on the Peconic Bay and offers 470 feet of water frontage and a private beach. Two homes sit on either end of the property: a 3,500-square-foot waterfront residence on the south end and a 2,200-square-foot home on the north end near Main Road.\nA local family had owned the property for three generations when Christian Baiz, who owned the estate with his wife Rosamond Phelps Baiz, died last February. The family had used the property to run Old Field Vineyard, which closed at the end of November.\nCompass\u2019 Bridget Elkin, who had the listing with her husband Eric and also sold the Gladstone estate, said the parents lived in the house by the water while their daughter lived on the north side of the property.\nDespite the scale of the property, Elkin said, most of the interest came from parties with a \u201cresidential eye.\u201d About half of the land is covered in mature vines, and the zoning comes with an agricultural exception that allows for expanded farm operations, including the processing and sales of products like wine, crops and jams, according to the listing.\nElkin said the buyer has already re-hired the same staff that currently manages the vineyard, but its days as a commercial winery are likely over. \u201cIt will probably be more of a vibe of a vineyard,\u201d she said.\nPricing on the North Fork has followed the trajectory of the entire East End, where homes on either side of Peconic Bay have gotten vastly more expensive since 2020.\nThe median sale price $2.3 million for homes in the Hamptons set a new record in the fourth quarter of last year, while the quarterly median sales price on the North Fork broke $1 million for the first time ever last year, according to data from appraisal firm Miller Samuel.\nElkin said the recent sales, including another $8 million home she sold in Cutchogue earlier this year, are \u201cestablishing a new price tier on the North Fork that is possible.\u201d Each sale \u201ccreates data points for people coming into the area considering buying or selling a property of that magnitude,\u201d she added.\nShelter Island has not been immune to the runup in prices, either. An estate listed for\n$18 million\nlast month is eying an island record, after a property at One Pandion asking\n$15 million\nfell just short last year of the $12.95 million record set in 2023.\n",

        "content": "As a raft of attorneys\nduke it out in a Manhattan courtroom\nover commercial sex trafficking charges levied against the Alexander brothers, a new lawsuit claims the brothers enacted their alleged scheme in South Florida and were aided and abetted by their family and employers.\nIn a complaint\nfiled in Florida\u2019s Southern District last week\n, Tiffany Rodriguez accused twins Oren and Alon Alexander of a sex trafficking scheme enabled by a Miami club, their parents Orly and Shlomy Alexander, the family\u2019s security firm, Oren\u2019s longtime brokerage Douglas Elliman and the firm\u2019s former chairman and CEO Howard Lorber. Rodriguez named all of these players as defendants.\nThe suit adds to at least 30 civil actions filed against the Alexander brothers (though some have been dismissed) on top of federal sex trafficking charges. Rodriguez alleges the twin brothers, who are on trial in New York with their older brother Tal, \u201cused a network of entities and other individuals who helped facilitate, fund, and enable their sex trafficking scheme.\u201d\nThe suit includes many similar claims to a suit filed by\na group of women in February 2025\n. The past action, filed against all three brothers, raised allegations of attacks that took place between 2009 and 2017 in New York and Florida, and also alleged negligence and encouragement by those closest to the brothers, including their parents and Lorber, who previously denied the allegations through a lawyer. (Rodriguez\u2019s suit does not name Tal as a defendant.)\nThe brothers have denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\nSpokespeople for Douglas Elliman, Marriott International, the owner of Edition Hotels, and Orly and Shlomy Alexander did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe assault\nRodriguez says she met the brothers in September 2016 after a promoter invited her and a friend to \u201chang out\u201d with Oren and Alon at Basement Miami, a club under the Edition Hotel.\nAfter drinking in the club\u2019s VIP section, she was in and out of consciousness and later woke up restrained to an office chair. She says in the complaint she was being raped by Oren and Alon \u201csimultaneously,\u201d with the brothers switching off filming on a cell phone.\nShe eventually fled the room and the apartment with her friend, whom she told about the attack, according to the complaint. Later the next day, her boyfriend received a video of the attack, she says in the lawsuit.\nShortly after telling a friend about the attack, she heard from a private investigator acting on Oren\u2019s behalf, \u201cwho conveyed a threatening and coercive message: \u2018the Alexander Brothers asserted that the sexual acts were consensual and that Plaintiff\u2019s credibility would be attacked,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nRodriguez said in the complaint she was \u201cunaware of the breadth of Defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d until their\narrests by federal authorities in December 2024\n.\nJuda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for the brothers, denied on their behalf the existence of any video in a statement\nto the Miami Herald\n.\n\u201cAs with the other allegations in this civil filing, these assertions remain unproven,\u201d Engelmayer told the outlet. \u201cQuestions of consent and criminal conduct are determined by evidence, not by hindsight, personal relationships, or narrative claims made years later.\u201d\nThe family firm\nRodriguez named parents Orly and Shlomy as defendants in their capacity as executives at Kent Security, the family-founded private security firm that operates in South Florida and New York, where Alon worked as an executive for much of his adult career.\nShlomy co-founded the firm, where Orly worked as chief financial officer and her brother, Gil Neuman, worked as chief executive officer.\nOrly and Shlomy continued \u201cto employ Alon despite reports dating back to high school that he, along with his brothers, were sexually assaulting and raping women,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nRodriguez added in the complaint that Kent benefited from Alon and Oren\u2019s close relationship, which exposed the firm to the increased visibility, prestige and access to elite client networks that Oren enjoyed as a top luxury broker.\nThe accused enablers at Elliman\n\u201cLorber, and other senior [Elliman] leadership, had knowledge of Oren Alexander\u2019s propensity to sexually abuse women but continued to fund, facilitate, and promote the sex trafficking scheme,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in the complaint.\nLorber was chairman and CEO during Oren and his brother Tal\u2019s 10-year stint at Elliman, and also served as a mentor to the budding star brokers. Oren wrote in the New York Post in 2013 his own father, Shlomy, referred to Lorber as Oren\u2019s \u201csecond father.\u201d\n\u201cMultiple real estate professionals reported that they either had personally told executives at Douglas Elliman about assaults by the Alexander Brothers or had been told about said assaults by company executives,\u201d Rodriguez claimed in the complaint.\nThe claim echoes previous reports that Lorber was aware of specific incidents involving the brothers\u2019 behavior with women. The brothers\u2019 behavior was \u201can open secret\u201d in the industry, former Elliman broker Brian Meier told the New York Times in August 2014, and it was understood Lorber was aware of \u201cat least one incident.\u201d\nTwo claims that reportedly made it to Elliman executives were those of Tracy Tutor, a former top Elliman agent who has appeared on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d who told the Times she shared a drink with Oren after an event in 2014 before blacking out, and agent Jessica Cohen, who said she attended a 2010 birthday party with Tal, Alon and Oren Alexander hours before passing out and waking up in the hospital after someone found her alone in the street.\nCohen said she told Lorber in 2012, when the two were playing chess after work, that she thought she\u2019d been drugged by Tal and Oren. A spokesperson for Elliman confirmed that Lorber had heard of an incident but maintained that it was confidential and not an official human resources complaint.\n\u201cThe allegations in the complaint concerning Howard Lorber are conclusory and false,\u201d Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Lorber, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Lorber had absolutely no role in or knowledge of the Alexander brothers\u2019 alleged sex trafficking venture. Mr. Lorber intends to get the case against him dismissed.\u201d\nElliman\nhas previously denied\nany knowledge of allegations against the Alexanders and Lorber\u2019s possible knowledge of any allegations.",

The residences will rise next to the $250 million\nWest Harbor development\n, a 42-acre mixed-use entertainment hub set to open this summer.\nThe Jules San Pedro property will consist of a combination of studio, one- and two-bedroom units with amenities including a pool deck, courtyard, sauna, spa, clubhouse, sky lounge, rooftop deck, barbecue areas, pet spa and coworking space with conference rooms. Another 1,276 square feet of ground-floor retail space is planned for the site.\nConstruction on Jules San Pedro is expected to begin this quarter, with the units planned to open to residents by the second quarter of 2028.\nDallas-based High Street Residential is no stranger to the area near the San Pedro Port Complex.\nThe Trammell Crow residential arm recently completed another multifamily development near West Harbor called\nVivo on Harbor\n. The 137-unit residential community is located one block north of the future Jules San Pedro site. The eight-story building at 511 South Harbor Boulevard has 16 units set aside as affordable housing as the developer received a density bonus incentive allowing it to reach 85 feet, or 24 feet higher than zoning allows. Nearly 1,500 square feet of shops and restaurants are also included.\nIn late 2024, Trammell Crow acquired an approved project to build 281 apartments at\n625 South Beacon Street\nin San Pedro. Vancouver, Washington-based Holland Partner Group, which sold the property, was greenlit to build studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 2,300 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "NASA is officially inviting the private sector deeper into its orbit near Houston, opening the door for commercial development on nearly 184 acres of excess land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center.\nThe space agency issued an announcement for proposals seeking tenants for 183.7 acres within Exploration Park, a site just outside JSC that agency leaders have been positioning as a hub for space-related industry, according to filings posted to the federal contracting site SAM.gov and\nreported\nby the Houston Business Journal. Proposals are due April 30, with NASA hosting site visits on Feb. 18. JLL was named leasing broker for Exploration Park earlier this year.\nA map included with the AFP shows the land carved largely into 10-acre parcels, along with several smaller tracts and a 13-acre section labeled \u201cOption Arrow.\u201d The site is accessible via Saturn Lane and sits inside JSC\u2019s secured perimeter \u2014 a detail that could shape how developers and tenants approach the opportunity, according to the publication.\nNASA\nis offering long-term ground leases with a 20-year base term and two additional 20-year options. Rents range from roughly $8,100 per acre to $11,800 per acre per year, depending on the parcel, with annual rent escalations of 3 percent. According to the AFP, tenants would be responsible for utilities and would need to propose access points that comply with NASA\u2019s security requirements, since all available parcels currently require badge access.\nNASA said it expects office, factory and storage tenants and could allow assembly, university and even mercantile uses, depending on the proposal.\nResidential development\n, however, is explicitly off the table.\nJohnson Space Center leadership has been laying the groundwork for years. Director Vanessa Wyche said in a January interview with the outlet that\nNASA\nviews the effort as a way to accelerate partnerships with commercial space companies and related industries.\nMomentum is already building around JSC, as Texas A&amp;M University\nbroke ground\nin November on its $200 million TAMU Space Institute nearby, backed by state funding. The facility has lined up tenants including Astrolab, Intuitive Machines and Interlune, and is expected to be substantially completed this year.\nElsewhere in Exploration Park, Austin-based American Center for Manufacturing and Innovation has been tapped to develop a 22-building campus across 207 acres, while Houston-based KBR signed a letter of intent this year to build a 45,000-square-foot facility focused on advanced human-centric systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Investors in a Brookfield Opportunity Zone fund that invests in New York and Connecticut real estate have been absolutely crushed, but don\u2019t know why.\nThe fund, Brookfield Opportunity 71IV7, had an internal rate of return of negative 18.3 percent through the third quarter of last year. Since mid 2019 it had lost 71 percent of its value.\nOne investor in the fund told me the massive loss \u201cmakes no reasonable sense.\u201d\nIndeed, except for rent-stabilized housing, New York City real estate has bounced back since the pandemic. Even Class B and Class C office space written off for dead has recovered some value, thanks to return-to-office and office-to-resi conversions.\nBut the rise in interest rates alone wiped out billions of dollars in equity, and some individual properties have fared badly. And this Brookfield fund was apparently quite concentrated. It is said to have sunk $1 billion into just a few assets, notably a new apartment building in the Bronx and a mall in Connecticut.\nThe investor thought the Bronx property was a four-tower development at 2401 Third Avenue, but that doesn\u2019t really track because that project appears to be doing well enough. It was able to refinance its construction loan in 2024, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\n:\n\u201cAres Management refinanced construction debt secured by 460 new apartments at 2401 Third Avenue in the Bronx, and 410 new units at 1 Bell Slip in Brooklyn, both owned by Brookfield Properties. Brookfield has invested heavily in master-planned developments in New York, building 1,350 multifamily units at its Bankside campus in Mott Haven, and 1,200 new units at Greenpoint Landing.\u201d\nThe report added, \u201cRents have held strong in New York. In Mott Haven, at 2401 Third Avenue, units list for $2,900 to $3,900 per month.\u201d The housing lottery for affordable units at the 921-unit development\u2019s four towers, dubbed Lincoln at Bankside (aka 101 Lincoln Avenue),\nlaunched\nin 2023.\nOnly five of the 145 units set aside for 130 percent AMI households are available, according to this\nlisting page\n. However, Brookfield is offering four months of free base rent on a two-year lease and shows\n95 available units\n.\nThat would put the vacancy rate at just above 10 percent, assuming the 921-unit project is complete. That\u2019s not bad for a market-rate project in Mott Haven. It certainly wouldn\u2019t explain the investment fund\u2019s 71 percent drop.\nHowever, there might be more vacant units than the 95 listed as available by Brookfield. And interest rates are much higher now than they were seven years ago, which has broadly devalued real estate. Operating expenses have probably risen more than market-rate rents in Mott Haven, and rents on the affordable units have risen below the rate of inflation.\nAlso, it\u2019s quite conceivable that the fund\u2019s Connecticut mall has tanked since 2019.\nCould all of that add up to a 71 percent loss? Brookfield isn\u2019t saying. Its press team has not responded to three messages sent over the past four weeks.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nEvery new year is\npredicted\n(or at least hoped) to be the year that C-PACE lending gets going in New York. But it never happens. Meanwhile,\ndevelopers\nin\nTexas\n,\nFlorida\n,\nSan Francisco\nand elsewhere are getting\nC-PACE loans\nlike candy from a busted pi\u00f1ata. Why can\u2019t New York lawmakers and bureaucrats make this possible in the alleged finance capital of the world? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Next year, Con Ed will break out the portion of customers\u2019 gas and electricity bills that goes toward property taxes.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWhile the Mamdani administration slams rent-stabilized landlords and praises resident-run housing, three developments in the latter category didn\u2019t exactly shine in an\naudit\nby the state comptroller.\nThe auditors at Thomas DiNapoli\u2019s office looked at the Mitchell-Lama projects Clinton Towers, Evergreen Gardens and Tivoli Towers and found problems with all of them.\nHazardous physical conditions cited included facade damage, broken self-closing and fire doors and units with mold, water damage and peeling paint. One commercial tenant \u2014 a day care center \u2014 had mouse droppings.\nOn the financial side, the affordable co-ops spent $114,000 on bonuses, holiday parties and gratuities over six years. Another $50,000 went to unknown expenditures.\nAll three developments spent $100,000 on vendors without notifying the Department of Housing Preservation and Development as required. \u201cEvergreen contracted with five vendors with payments over $100,000 without receiving HPD approval and no evidence of competitive bidding,\u201d the audit noted.\nClinton and Tivoli towers left some units vacant for four months or more, leaving $328,000 in rent uncollected.\nThese are not huge problems, but they shed light on the kind of oversight required for Mitchell-Lamas.\nThe main issue with this housing model seems to be that it is not sustainable without government support that other building types \u2014 rent-stabilized, for example \u2014 do not have. As Mitchell-Lama buildings wear down and require more capital investment, and tax breaks expire, their residents run to the government for money.\nLast month, the Hochul administration said it would give Bay Ridge Towers $49 million, or $60,400 per unit. Jimerson Apartments in Brownsville got $39 million, or\n$92,600 per unit\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$18.5 million\nfor Unit 16B at the Aman, 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown unit is 3,600 square feet. This marks the second day in a row a sponsor sale in the Aman was the city\u2019s top sale.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$23.6 million\nfor 1057-59 Lexington Avenue. The Lenox Hill rentals total 20 units and over 20,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.5 million for 123 East 61st Street. The Lenox Hill townhome is 9,200 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nIan Slater, Carlin Smith, Jennifer Regen and Michael Koeneke have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Bott is moving back to his hometown of London with his family after a career with Swire that spans more than a decade and posts in China, Vietnam and Florida. He was named president in 2023 after\nSwire\u2019s Kieran Bowers\nstepped down to move back to the U.K. as well.\nMartin is also a longtime Swire executive. He joined the firm in 2018 as a vice president focused on the firm\u2019s retail portfolio in South Florida, namely Brickell City Centre, which reached 100 percent occupancy under his leadership. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2023, according to LinkedIn.\nMartin spearheaded Swire\u2019s sale of its majority stake in Brickell City Centre to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n, a deal that closed in June. As Swire moved to divest from its Brickell retail holdings, it also sold a dev site to Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International for\n$45 million\nin August.\nNow the firm is focused squarely on its planned Residences at Mandarin Oriental, Miami, the condo-hotel project in Brickell Key.\nThe development includes 298 condos, 121 hotel keys and 28 hotel residences, the release shows. The design team includes Kohn Pedersen Fox, Tristan Auer, Laura Gonzalez and Shma. Fortune Development Sales is leading marketing for the project, which launched in 2023. Prices started at $3.5 million at the time.\nPre-sales total more than $1.2 billion, and construction is slated for later this year, according to the release.\nSwire Properties is a division of global conglomerate John Swire &amp; Sons, the British firm founded in 1816 by John Swire. Swire Properties\u2019 real estate investments are primarily in Asian markets in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan. Miami is its only American market.\nScions of the billionaire Swire family, including Barnaby Swire and Merlin Swire, remain involved in the business as directors of John Swire &amp; Sons.",

        "content": "Retail vacancy in the Loop fell for the second straight year in 2025, offering a modest but meaningful signal that the central business district is clawing its way back from the pandemic-era wipeout.\nThe Loop\u2019s retail vacancy rate dropped to 28.5 percent in 2025, down from 29.8 percent the year before, according to a report from Chicago-based brokerage Stone Real Estate. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat after years of shuttered storefronts and\nstalled leasing\n, the market appears to have hit bottom. Stone principal John Vance told the outlet that renewed activity in key corridors and a slow return of foot traffic contributed to that observation.\nState Street, long the poster child for downtown retail distress, has been a bright spot. A new Gap Factory store at 17 North State Street and a high-profile lease by Barnes &amp; Noble at 150 North State Street helped chip away at vacancies on the corridor, even as some big names continued to leave. The deals suggest retailers with an existing foothold downtown are seeing enough sales to double down, Vance said.\nGap\u2019s return comes eight years after the company closed its flagship State Street store. Vance said the move likely reflects steady performance at the Banana Republic Factory inside Block 37. Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s lease \u2014 one of the largest State Street has landed in years \u2014 also turned heads.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what momentum does, whether it be bad or good,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019ve got some good momentum.\u201d\nThe picture isn\u2019t\nuniformly rosy\n. State Street lost Saks Off Fifth and Anthropologie in 2024, and the vacancy rate remains elevated. More broadly, the Central Loop submarket saw its vacancy rate fall to 24.7 percent from 26 percent a year earlier, according to the report.\nElsewhere downtown,\nleasing followed\nthe office workers. In the LaSalle/Wacker corridor, improving office occupancy helped draw food-and-beverage tenants to the bases of well-capitalized towers. New arrivals included a butcher shop at 222 North LaSalle Street and fast-casual chains Cava and Mendocino Farms in Willis Tower, according to the publication. That submarket\u2019s vacancy rate dropped to 26.8 percent from 28.6 percent.\nAlong\nMichigan Avenue\nsouth of the river, tourist-oriented concepts drove most of the activity, including Portillo\u2019s and a Hello Kitty-themed caf\u00e9 at 360 North Michigan. Even so, the corridor\u2019s vacancy ticked up to 27.8 percent after a CVS closed at 300 South Michigan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The firm\u2019s search has been ongoing for months and no deal has closed with landlord\nBXP\n, according to the Business Times.\nThe news comes after an announcement Wednesday that the three-year-old company raised $250 million in a Series D funding round that placed the firm\u2019s value at $4.5 billion. Decagon\u2019s valuation has tripled in the past six months, with a $131 million Series C round last June valuing the company at $1.5 billion. The company said the following month that it planned to use the Series C capital for product development and to increase its employee headcount.\nDecagon is currently based at 100 First Street, across the street from\nSalesforce Tower\nin the city\u2019s Financial District. The size of its offices there are not clear.\nBXP is in negotiations with tenants to lease out 132,000 square feet of offices at 680 Folsom and the adjacent 50 Hawthorne Street. As of Wednesday, BXP has completed two deals for approximately 69,000 square feet at the two buildings, according to the Business Times. The two structures together total 522,406 square feet and were 65.8 percent occupied as of the fourth quarter, up from 59.2 percent the previous quarter, according to the Business Times.\nAI firms have been credited with\ndriving down vacancy and increasing demand\nfor office space in the San Francisco market. The amount of office space that was vacant or available for lease\ndecreased\nby nearly 2 million square feet in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter, marking the steepest drop in office availability in four consecutive quarters of decline, according to CoStar Group.\nCompanies in San Francisco leased\n1 million more square feet than they vacated in the fourth quarter, making for the largest such instance of positive absorption since 2018, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times.\nAI startup\nSierra inked the largest lease deal\nof last year in San Francisco, taking up 300,000 square feet at 185 Berry Street in China Basin. AI-focused companies account for about 2.8 million square feet of the approximately 8 million square feet of offices that firms are currently searching for in San Francisco, according to the Business Times. About 24 percent of office space in San Francisco is empty or available for lease, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The owner of a nearly half-century-old office building in downtown Fort Worth is framing the pending departure of a longtime anchor tenant as an opening, not a setback.\nRange Resources Corporation plans to vacate Two City Place at 100 Throckmorton Street when its lease expires in 2027, relocating to the 40-story 777 Main tower less than a mile away. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the Fort Worth-based energy company has occupied the building since 2007 and leases about 112,000 square feet \u2014 roughly 35 percent of the 320,000-square-foot tower \u2014 according to\nCitadel Partners\n, which handles leasing at the property.\nJon Ruff, president and COO of Dallas-based owner Spire Realty Group, confirmed the move and said Range\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t driven by issues at the building. Instead, Ruff said, Spire is already positioning Two City Place to capitalize on what will become one of the largest contiguous blocks of available office space in\ndowntown Fort Worth\n.\n\u201cWe expect that the space is going to lease,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cAnd we expect that it\u2019s going to lease at a rate that is probably better than we would have gotten if we would have renewed Range Resources.\u201d\nRange will take four floors at the 777 Main new trophy tower, which is rising in the central business district. A company spokesman said the new space will be similar in size to its current space, but declined to elaborate on the rationale for the move.\nTwo City Place \u2014 formerly part of the\nTandy Towers complex\n\u2014 is one of two 19-story buildings tied to an annex with retail and a parking garage. The broader City Place complex totals about 1.2 million square feet and once served as RadioShack\u2019s headquarters. Two City Place was last renovated in 2008, while its sister tower was updated in 2014, according to the outlet.\nSpire plans to use the transition to freshen the building, including a \u201cmajor overhaul\u201d of common areas with a focus on the lobby, Ruff said. New ground-floor retail is also on the way, including a coffee shop and Italian restaurant Buonissimo.\nDowntown\nFort Worth\u2019s\ncombined Class A and B vacancy rate sits at about 11 percent, and large blocks of space are scarce, according to Citadel. Two City Place is currently just under 90 percent leased and will be able to offer roughly 120,000 contiguous square feet once Range leaves.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The median rent in Los Angeles County also fell to a four-year low of $2,035 per month.\nRents in L.A. haven\u2019t been that low since January 2022 when apartments were emptier and prices were diminished after former renters went on a pandemic-era homebuying spree.\nThe decrease in rents is in line with national trends, as the U.S. median rent also dropped a four-year low in December. In Southern California, L.A. stands as an outlier. Over the past four years, rents in Orange, Ventura and\nSan Bernardino Counties either rose\nor remained flat.\nWhether the drop is a sign of a further decline or a simple blip remains to be seen. Some experts believe it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come, while others see it as a brief price plateau before rents rise again this year, according to the Times. The winter rental market is usually slower than the summer, and the December 2025 low is only 4.2 percent below the all-time high of $2,262 in August 2022.\nLos Angeles has largely fallen behind other cities like\nSan Diego\nwhen it comes to housing construction, but last year marked a significant uptick in new apartments hitting the market, according to the Times. In total, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in Los Angeles, marking an 18 percent increase year-over-year and the second-highest amount in the past decade, per CoStar data cited by Kidder Mathews in its fourth-quarter multifamily\nreport\n.\nStill, as multifamily housing supply increased, demand fell as L.A.

The development will have 264 units accommodating 630 beds in a metal frame construction, the filing and Parallel\u2019s\nplans\nshow. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe 127-year-old congregation owns about 4.5 acres next to Baylor University, and the 2.4-acre parcel allotted to the upcoming project is now under contract, according to Cromwell Commercial Group associate Caleb Loudamy, who has the listing for the property.\nThe new building will replace the sanctuary of the church, which was built in 1955, a student newspaper\nreported\n.\nAttorney and theologian Kent McKeever, a Baylor affiliate and member of the church, has an organizational role in the project, according to the filing. McKeever, founding partner of nonprofit legal aid organization, Waco Legal Services, attracted national attention some years ago for\nwearing a prison jumpsuit for Lent\n.\nNeither McKeever nor an associate with Parallel immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIn a trend dubbed \u201cYes in God\u2019s Backyard,\u201d developers around the country are scouting land owned by religious organizations, which are among the biggest landowners in America. In\nHouston\n, a senior housing project is planned for land owned by a Methodist church in the Third Ward neighborhood. In\nAustin\n, a church is developing a mixed-use project around its next branch. And in\nDallas\n, Generation Housing Partners is planning to replace a defunct church building with an affordable apartment complex.Waco isn\u2019t the only college town in Texas where developers are putting millions into student housing. In College Station, where\nlocal ordinances constricted student rental housing supply until last year\n, Subtext plans to spend\n$160 million\non a 21-story tower a block and a half from Texas A&amp;M University.\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate Partners won the do-over bankruptcy auction for a distressed downtown Miami development site, only this time it will pony up $18 million more than its previous winning bid.\nNew York-based Cirrus, the lender on the nearly 1-acre property at 340 Biscayne Boulevard, made the opening $77 million credit bid Wednesday and competed with an unknown bidder in $5 million increments, with Cirrus ultimately winning at $95 million, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nConcierge Auctions held the second auction after Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny\u2019s\nlegal complaint\ngot Cirrus\u2019 initial win tossed. Gabriel Flores of One Commercial, a subsidiary of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, listed the site.\nThe sale isn\u2019t final until approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Laurel Isicoff in Miami, who is expected to take up the deal in a Feb. 11 hearing.\nThe outcome marks another chapter in the saga between Cirrus and the property owner, Bomeny, over the 10-story, 200-key Holiday Inn, which has approvals for an 82-story redevelopment.\nCirrus filed a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure in 2024 against Bomeny\u2019s entity, alleging it defaulted on a\n$70 million\nloan.\nBomeny paid $65 million in 2015 for the site and 1950-built hotel. The property was already approved for an Arquitectonica-designed tower with\n374 condos\n, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAfter the UCC foreclosure filing, Bomeny\u2019s affiliate filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, leading to the first bankruptcy auction last month. Bidding had opened at $72 million. Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, won with a\n$77 million\ncredit bid.\nBut Bomeny\u2019s ownership entity convinced the judge to order a do-over auction, alleging \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the auction process that barred bidders who would have ponied up more money for the site.\nCirrus disputed that in court filings, accusing Bomeny of being \u201cunwilling to accept the auction\u2019s outcome\u201d and arguing that other potential bidders hadn\u2019t registered for the auction and submitted a required $250,000 deposit.\nThe judge\nordered\nthe do-over auction this month.\nCirrus representatives and attorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum condo tower in downtown Miami and the Regalia Residences condo in Sunny Isles Beach.\nThe UCC foreclosure and subsequent bankruptcy auctions came as landlords are struggling with elevated interest rates that shot up following increases in 2022 and 2023. This increased loan obligations for property owners with floating-rate debt and\nno interest rate caps\n, and made refinancing maturing loans more expensive.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve made several cuts to the benchmark rate in 2024 and last year, it kept rates steady this month.\nSouth Florida owners also felt an additional sting from skyrocketing insurance premiums in recent years and increases in other expenses due to higher labor and materials costs.\nSome multifamily development site owners who had planned to seize on South Florida\u2019s rental boom of recent years instead\nput their properties on the for-sale market\n, either looking for project equity partners or scrapping projects altogether.\nOther landlords lost their properties in foreclosure.\nAlso in downtown Miami, Raoul Thomas\u2019 CGI Merchant lost its 129-key Gabriel Downtown Miami hotel in a UCC foreclosure to lender Madison Realty Capital in 2024 over a\n$60.4 million loan\n. The hotel is on the first 14 floors at the luxury Marquis condo tower at 1100 Biscayne Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Two 432 Park Avenue condos\nat the center of an ownership\ndispute between Harry Macklowe and CIM Group have gone into contract.\nA buyer in the building has agreed to pay $53 million for units 78A and 78B, which combine to span the entire 78th floor, two sources familiar with the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe seller is an entity tied to the building\u2019s sponsor, CIM Group, and not, as some had previously been led to believe, Harry Macklowe, who lost the units last year after he defaulted on the loans he had taken out from CIM to purchase the units in 2021.\nIf the deal closes at that price, it would be nearly exactly how much CIM claimed Macklowe owed in October 2023, when it had originally scheduled a foreclosure sale for the units, according to court filings.\nMacklowe paid roughly $47 million for the two 78th-floor units and a smaller 28th-floor unit, according to public records. The deal does not include the accessory unit, a source told\nTRD\n.\nThe kerfuffle over who owned the units began after a Douglas Elliman agent approached the Wall Street Journal with an exclusive story last year about Macklowe\u2019s plan to list the 78th-floor units for $75 million.\nThose plans were shot once it was revealed that Macklowe\nno longer controlled the units\n. CIM had provided the mezzanine financing for Macklowe when he purchased the units in 2022, over a decade after CIM had helped finance Macklowe\u2019s purchase of the Drake Hotel, which would ultimately become the 432 Park development. A year after buying the penthouse units, in 2023, CIM initiated foreclosure proceedings, which were ultimately halted due to a settlement that gave Macklowe a five-month period to refinance or sell the units.\nMacklowe was unable to fulfill the settlement requirements. A court order from July of last year confirmed that the units had been transferred to CIM and that Macklowe and his wife, Patricia Landeau, were ordered to vacate the premises by the end of August.\nThe 78th-floor spans 8,300 square feet and is divided into one larger 7,000-square-foot unit and a smaller 1,200-square-foot unit. The second unit could be \u201cseamlessly combined or maintained as a separate guest apartment,\u201d according to marketing materials provided to the Journal.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis and Nicholas Compagnone had the off-market listing, according to multiple sources.\nManaging to sell the units for more than Macklowe paid is still a win in a building that has faced a slew of bad press around lawsuits between the condo board and the developers, Macklowe and CIM, in the last few years.\nA lawsuit filed by the condo\nin 2021\nalleged that the 125-unit building was plagued with noise issues, leaks and broken elevators. The developers have denied those claims, but the residents followed up last year with\nanother lawsuit\nclaiming Macklowe and CIM knew the building would have problems and proceeded anyway.\nThe drama has seemed to weigh on the prices of units for sale. Ten of the 13 units currently listed on StreetEasy have experienced a price drop. Unit 84B, one of the units without a price drop, is listed for $75 million after its owner, Jose Cuervo owner Juan Beckmann Vidal, had\nreportedly\noriginally considered listing it for $90 million.",

For a deal to cross the finish line, the biggest issue that needs to be worked out is rent payments for Cooper Union, which owns the ground underneath the building. The ground rent is expected to hit $41 million in two years, according to the college\u2019s financial statement.\nIt would be a return for Rob Speyer\u2019s firm, which acquired the Chrysler Building in 1997 for $220 million. Over the next couple of decades, its interest in the property dwindled, finally washed away for good in 2019 when RFR and Signa Holding bought Tishman\u2019s remaining stake for $150 million.\nBut Cooper Union has been\nworking with Savills\nfor the better part of a year to find fresh ownership as RFR was kicked out and Signa went bankrupt.\nLast January, a judge\nterminated RFR\u2019s ground lease\nat the property, ejecting it from the skyscraper.\nRFR had sued Cooper Union in September 2024 after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease. Cooper Union claimed the developer stopped paying rent several months earlier and racked up arrears to the tune of $21 million.\nSL Green\u2019s Marc Holliday\nexpressed interest\nin acquiring the property several months ago, but his interest reportedly cooled since then. Savanna, a Midtown office owner that\u2019s been making moves left and right, was also interested in the building.\nShould Tishman lock in its return, it will have work to do to restore the Chrysler Building to its former glory. The tenant roster includes law firm Moses &amp; Singer, Creative Artists Agency and architect Ted Moudis, but there have been complaints about elevator outages and mice. The vacancy rate of the 1-million-square-foot building is 14 percent, according to CoStar.\nTishman declined to comment to the publication.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is aiming to expand her real estate initiatives amid flak from the opposing political party.\nLevine Cava\nhighlighted her administration\u2019s efforts to make permitting more accessible, spur more construction of affordable and workforce housing and provide financial assistance to condo owners facing steep special assessments during her state-of-the-county address this week.\nShe is facing a recall petition led by one of her political opponents, Cuban American social media influencer Alex Otaola. Otaola lost to Levine Cava, placing third in an August 2024 election that the incumbent won by a landslide.\nThe county\u2019s Republican Party is supporting the recall effort against\nLevine Cava\n, a Democrat, through social media, paid ads and a website to promote the petition, which needs to be signed by at least 4 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s 1.6 million registered voters to trigger an election.\nHowever, Levine Cava will surely count on South Florida\u2019s real estate industry to financially back efforts to tamp down the recall.\nDuring her 2024 campaign, roughly a quarter of the\n$4.6 million\nher political action committee raised prior to the August election came from 17 real estate developers and commercial property investors, finance reports analyzed by\nThe Real Deal\nshow.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager\nKen Griffin\ngave the largest contribution, with a $500,000 donation. Recently, the county approved plans for his firm Citadel\u2019s planned high-rise headquarters in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nLevine Cava\u2019s PAC collected $110,000 between October and December with half of the funds donated by real estate developers, a campaign finance report shows.\nSince she was first elected in 2020, the county has added 9,000 affordable and workforce housing units, and it will aim to add 12,000 more by the time she leaves office in 2028, Levine Cava said during her speech.\nHer administration has negotiated deals with developers to build mixed-income projects on county-owned land, including agreements to redevelop dilapidated public housing sites. The mayor identified two projects,\nGallery at River Parc\nand Brisas del Rio, by Coconut Grove-based Related Group as examples of her efforts.\n\u201cWhat was once outdated, public housing is now a walkable, mixed income community with more homes, shops, green spaces and support services,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still more work to do. I directed our housing team to identify vacant county land that can be transformed into housing.\u201d\nLevine Cava highlighted permitting kiosks placed around the county to help small businesses cut through bureaucratic hurdles, and a program that provides financing to condo owners who don\u2019t have funds to pay for special assessments. During the speech, she pointed to Harrison Bloom, a constituent in the audience who opened a frozen yogurt store in Miami Beach.\n\u201cHarrison ran into familiar problems,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cHis plans were stalled by red tape, and city and county permitting. Through our new Strive 305 permitting kiosks, Harrison was able to complete all his permits in just 16 days.\u201d\nThe special assessment assistance program has provided a combined $53 million in interest-free loans to nearly 2,000 households in Miami-Dade, Levine Cava said.",

        "content": "Concern and offense were aired Thursday by members of an oversight committee following an attempt earlier this week to jam\namendments\nto LA\u2019s so-called mansion tax onto the June ballot.\nThursday\u2019s vote by the Measure United to House L.A. Citizens Oversight Committee, the group established through the November 2022 ballot measure to monitor use of Measure ULA funds, could offer a look at the uphill battle proposed carveouts to the two-tier property tax could face in the coming months.\nMeasure ULA\n, which went into effect in April 2023, applies a 4 percent tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe 15-member oversight committee agreed on Thursday to send a letter to the city council expressing concern for being excluded from any process to amend Measure ULA, The body also appointed its own ad hoc committee to take a closer look at the exemptions being sought.\n\u201cHonestly, it is so offensive that this amendment was proposed [to the] city council without even once coming to the COC,\u201d committee member Jeanne Nishimoto said during the meeting. She went on to say the bid for a fast-tracked move to make changes to ULA \u201chighlights that this body is being pushed aside.\u201d\nDemocratic Socialist Nithya Raman, a leader among local progressives who represents the 4th District on the City Council, introduced her proposed changes on Friday. They seek a 15-year exemption from ULA on new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects in what is the most significant proposed change to the ordinance since it rolled out nearly three years ago. In addition, the motion called for a one-time, three-year carveout from ULA for property owners impacted by a natural disaster and retroactive to Jan. 7, 2025 to address Palisades Fire damages.\nRaman and supporters of the ULA changes had hoped for consideration and a vote from the 15-person council this week. However, the bid to push it onto the June ballot evaporated on Wednesday, the deadline for the city attorney to prepare a resolution for such a measure.\nInstead, Tuesday\u2019s council meeting kicked Raman\u2019s proposal down to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n, which has yet to place the item on a future meeting agenda.\nWhile the ULA oversight committee\u2019s decisions do not create policy, the group acts as an advisor to the city and is billed as a cross-section of individuals with experience in housing development and finance, renter protection,\u00a0 and also includes two youth \u2014 ages 16 to 21\u2014 advisory seats.\n\u201cUnintended consequences\u201d\nAs of Thursday, Measure ULA has raised $1.1 billion across 1,497 transactions since inception. Supporters of the tax often point to the metric as proof of its\nsuccesses\n.\nCritics often take aim at the figure and harken back to 2022, when the ballot measure and its backers estimated to voters that $600 million to $1.1 billion could be generated each year from ULA.\nThe largest contributing segment to that total has been single-family residential of which 864 deals have brought in $441.5 million, according to data from the Los Angeles Housing Department through the end of 2025.\nMultifamily, which generally refers to apartments and\u00a0 is the driver behind Raman\u2019s proposed changes, is the third-largest bucket of ULA revenue, behind offices and various other types of commercial properties. Since April 2023, the multifamily segment generated has $171.9 million, or 13 percent of the overall pie.\nRaman and others, including real estate industry executives, argue that the tax has stifled multifamily construction, which runs counter to ULA\u2019s stated goal of housing affordability and homelessness prevention. Across the real estate industry brokers, agents and developers have offered similar takes as deals and construction stalls.\nMike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, told a crowd gathered Tuesday in Beverly Hills for\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cBuilding Luxury\u201d panel that he\u2019s seen apartment owners go for conversions and sell units individually rather than try to market a whole building and pay the ULA tax.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, told\nTRD\non Monday he\u2019s seeing a similar trend play out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting the way ULA is structured, it\u2019s actually an incentive for many landlords and property owners to break up their multifamily projects and sell them as individual units and take them out of the renter pool,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just starting to happen, but I\u2019ve heard a number of landlords talk about that because they simply feel they have no choice. I think that would be really unfortunate because the last thing we need is to be taking multifamily units out of the renter pool. It\u2019s only going to drive rents up for everybody else.\u201d\nWhile the changes would be a boon to apartment and commercial construction, some say they don\u2019t address the pain points of what luxury single-family residential agents have faced with deals falling apart or extended negotiations over the tax.\n\u201cNatural disaster exemptions are especially important, but there is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum,\u201d Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman told\nTRD\nthis week.\n",

        "content": "The Hamptons\u2019 residential market rode Wall Street money and tight inventory to a banner quarter.\nDuring the last three months of 2025, median home prices rose over 33 percent annually to over $2.3 million, according to a report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. The price marks an all-time high for the wealthy enclave.\nThe fourth quarter saw a second record for the market, with 82 homes sold for over $5 million.\nThe period caps off a return to form in the Hamptons in 2025, swept up by\na strong luxury wave\nin markets around the country. The Hamptons submarket has been hit by a double-whammy for surging prices: a booming stock market and no inventory, according to report author Jonathan Miller.\nLike other markets, the Hamptons saw deals for more affordable homes lag amid high mortgage rates, while luxury homes trade for peak prices and typically to all-cash buyers.\nMedian prices had cracked $2 million for the first time at the start of 2025. The share of homes sold for over $1 million has historically been 50 percent in the Hamptons, according to Miller, but last quarter it fell to below 30 percent.\n\u201cA big part of this price growth, it\u2019s not appreciation as much as it is a shift in the mix towards larger units,\u201d said Miller.\nThe very top of the market felt that movement last year. In 2025, the top 10 priciest deals in the Hamptons accounted for $579 million in transaction volume, a significant increase from $327 million in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all driven by the economy,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen, who had the listing for a\n$57 million sale\nin Bridgehampton in October. Gundersen noted that Wall Street bonuses drive much of the first-time Hamptons buyers who look in the sub-$20 million market, while the deals over $20 million often attract \u201cunique buyers.\u201d\n\u201c[They] sold a company, own a company [are] CEO of a company that is a financial institution that does really, really well,\u201d she said of the buyer profile of the ultra-luxury housing stock.\nThis year also saw the most expensive single-lot residential sale in Hamptons history, when Access Industries\u2019\nLen Blavatnik paid a record $115 million\nfor eight-and-a-half acres at 408 Further Lane.\nThere were roughly 1,000 homes on the market in the fourth quarter, well below the long-term historical average. The 470 sales were above the 10-year average for the fourth quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the wild card in terms of seeing more activity in the Hamptons in 2026 will be, whether more sellers dip their toe into the market,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "After crossing the $1 billion threshold last year, Access Industries and the Witkoff Group refinanced the\nOne High Line\nluxury condo development.\nAres Management and JPMorgan Chase provided $525 million to the developers behind the 236-unit project, which also counts Monroe Capital as part of the development team, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The refinancing will help with carrying costs for the unsold units at the West Chelsea site.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop Capital Markets Institutional Advisory arranged the financing.\nThe debt is the latest sign of how far the development has come in the years since Access and Witkoff took the reins from the now-defunct HFZ Capital Group.\nWitkoff and Access\ntook over\nthe Eleventh Avenue site in 2021 after the project\u2019s primary lender foreclosed on HFZ\u2019s stake. Under HFZ, the development was plagued by conflicts with contractors, sluggish sales and concern over the company\u2019s financial standing.\nAccess and Witkoff paid $900 million for the property, roughly the same amount HFZ paid for it in 2015. But it was already nearly two-thirds complete when it was sold by HFZ.\nWhen the developers resumed work, they put their own stamp on the property, updating unit designs so that no two in either of the twisting towers were identical. They also changed the amenity package and the finishes and swapped out a planned Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas for a five-star Faena Hotel.\nIn the summer of 2022,\nsales re-launched\nat the project rebranded as One High Line from The XI. They tapped a team from Corcoran Sunshine, led by Deborah Kern and Steve Gold, to lead sales and marketing. About a year later, the development scored its first closing and buyers began moving in.\nOne High Line was among the top-selling new developments in New York City in 2023 and 2024. In August 2024, the developers scored one of the largest single-asset loans of the year when JPMorgan and Tyko Capital agreed to a\n$1 billion refinancing package\n.\nThere are still 54 units available at the building, starting at $2.8 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Colombo, founder of CMC, said the developers were considering more than 10 lenders \u201cproviding highly competitive terms.\u201d\nThe 20-story, 70-unit luxury condo tower, at 2699 South Bayshore Drive, is expected to be completed in the middle of 2028. The developers demolished the previous building last year.\nThe project will mark the\nfirst Four Seasons\nin the popular Miami neighborhood. Over the past decade, a handful of condo towers have been completed in Coconut Grove, most recently including the two-building Mr. C Residences, a Terra development.\nSimilar to Fort Partners\u2019 other developments, sales are being handled in-house by brokerages led by both developers.\nProperty records show CMC owns the corner property, which is across Southwest 27th Avenue from the Ritz-Carlton Coconut Grove.\nFort Partners owns all of the Four Seasons properties in South Florida. The firm developed the uber successful Four Seasons Hotel and Residences at the Surf Club in Surfside, the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale, and owns the Four Seasons Miami hotel in Brickell and Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach.\nThe\nCoconut Grove tower\nwill include a restaurant, library, gym, spa, yoga room, children\u2019s room, lounge and bar, with access to Four Seasons amenities, including dining, spa, housekeeping and grocery services. The building will also have a pool deck and bar. Luis Revuelta is the architect, and Michele B\u00f6nan is designing the interiors.\u00a0The financing from Bank OZK adds to a steady stream of large construction loans that condo developers have secured across South Florida in recent months. Also this week, Terra and AB Asset Management closed on\na $410 million construction loan\nfor the Well Coconut Grove, a 194-unit condo project near the Four Seasons development.

        "content": "A North Side Chicago congregation is moving closer to a major lakefront-adjacent redevelopment that could bring hundreds of apartments, retail and a new place of worship to Sheridan Road.\nEmanuel Congregation, which has occupied its campus at 5959 North Sheridan Road since the 1950s, is working with Chicago-based developer Fern Hill Company on a mixed-use plan that would replace and expand the synagogue while adding residential buildings on both sides of the street,\naccording\nto Block Club Chicago. After months of meetings with congregants and neighborhood groups, the team submitted a zoning change request to 48th Ward Alderman Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth\u2019s office.\nThe proposal would allow two new buildings, the centerpiece being a 12-story, U-shaped structure fronting Sheridan Road that would incorporate a new synagogue on its lower floors, ground-floor commercial space and apartments above. Across the street, Fern Hill plans a five-story apartment building at 5948\nNorth Sheridan Road\n, a vacant parcel the firm bought last year for $5 million from Chicago-based Quest Realty Group, the outlet reported. Quest had previously explored a smaller, 59-unit\napartment project\non the site.\nIf approved, the larger building would also absorb Emanuel\u2019s existing synagogue and a neighboring home at 5965 North Sheridan, which Fern Hill would acquire as part of the deal, Fern Hill President Nick Anderson told Block Club. Renderings show the project opening south toward Lane Beach, an orientation the current building lacks.\nThe final unit count and parking totals are still in flux and will be shaped by further\ncommunity input\n, Anderson said. But under the zoning envelope the team is seeking, the development could support up to 605\napartments\nacross both buildings. Any rezoning would trigger Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, requiring 20 percent of the units to be affordable.\nFor the congregation, the redevelopment is as much about right-sizing as it is about location. Emanuel\u2019s existing 35,000-square-foot synagogue opened in 1955, when planners expected DuSable Lake Shore Drive to extend north through the site. Designed with a highway in mind, the building\u2019s east wall is largely windowless and soundproofed, according to the publication, even though the road was never built and Lake Michigan now sits just steps away.\nToday, Emanuel counts about 250 households and said the aging building is too large and costly to maintain. Plans call for a more efficient synagogue occupying the second and third floors of the new building, with a sanctuary, chapel, social halls, classrooms and offices. Housing revenue would help fund construction.\nManaa-Hoppenworth said her office will host a community meeting on the proposal next month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The move comes after Highbridge Equity Partners defaulted on a $111 million Rialto loan last year. Touchstone Commercial Partners\u2019 Christian Diggs has been appointed as receiver, operating and managing the property in Highbridge\u2019s place.\nThe three buildings have seen better days, according to the lawsuit. The legal filings claim the structures have broken windows, asbestos, and faulty elevators among other debris. People have reportedly been entering the buildings illegally and stealing copper wiring and others have been illegally camping inside, a receiver report said.\nTribune Tower at 401 13th Street reportedly has significant flood damage and is riddled with drug paraphernalia, abandoned mattresses and health and safety hazards like dog feces. The 16-story Financial Center Building a block away at 405 14th Street has a large amount of asbestos and debris with broken elevators. The 1500 Broadway building has broken windows and is plagued with plumbing and electrical issues.\nIn addition to defaulting on the $111 million loan, Highbridge also owed approximately $650,000 in property taxes across all three properties when the receiver took over last fall, which the receiver worked with Rialto to pay off. Another $650,000 payment is due in April. Rialto provided the $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and to pay for future renovations and improvements on the properties.\nHighbridge reportedly stopped making monthly payments on the debt last June and was\nserved a notice of default\ntwo months later. The unpaid balance is reportedly north of $100 million.\nHighbridge bought the three buildings between 2016 and 2019, for a total of $119.6 million. Whether Highbridge\u2019s lenders choose to sell the buildings to recoup all or some of the $111 million loan remains to be seen.\nOakland and the rest of the Bay Area have seen a\nstring of loan defaults and foreclosures\nat commercial properties in recent years. This week alone, Deutsche Bank\nseized\nthree other office towers in downtown Oakland via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, taking control of 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In total, the landlords reportedly booked almost 3,000 reservations that violated the city\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance.\nAccording to city attorneys, the landlords would wait for long-term tenants to move out, list the unit online, rent it out for month-to-month stays and cover up their tracks with what the city calls a \u201csham\u201d one-year lease after the booking was confirmed. Guests allegedly booked their intended stays on Airbnb and then were asked to sign leases that made the rentals look compliant with city laws even though neither tenant nor landlord intended for there to be a year-long tenancy.\nThe rentals were usually furnished and not used as primary residences by\nthe tenants\n, both of which are illegal under the ordinance. The landlords in some cases also allegedly did not file rent-control vacancy registration forms. Santa Monica\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance was passed in 2020 and requires leases to be one year or longer for unfurnished units and for tenants to use the units as their primary residence. The goal with the legislation is to keep much-needed multifamily housing off the short-term rental market.\n\u201cPreserving rent-controlled apartment homes and keeping rents down are top priorities for the city,\u201d Jonathan Frank, deputy city attorney for the City of Santa Monica, said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe city takes violations of its short-term rental ordinances seriously and will enforce them when needed.\u201d\nCity officials are asking the county to step in and put a stop to the alleged rental violations, force the disgorgement of the roughly $18 million in profits made and hand down civil penalties of $2,500 per violation.

        "content": "A long-troubled boutique hotel just off the Magnificent Mile changed hands recently, marking a reset for the property that in recent years cycled from foreclosure to homeless shelter.\nAn affiliate of Elk Grove Village-based Avasa Hospitality bought the 15-story, 122-room hotel at 100 East Chestnut Street earlier this month for just over $13 million, according to Cook County property records. The building, long known as the Tremont Hotel, last traded after being swept up in a foreclosure and briefly repurposed by the city during Chicago\u2019s migrant crisis, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe sale comes as signs of life return to the Magnificent Mile, the city\u2019s marquee retail strip along Michigan Avenue that struggled with vacancies and muted leasing since the pandemic. Hotel investors are starting to show up again, and late last year,\nVinayaka Hospitality\npaid $72 million for the 752-room Westin Michigan Avenue Chicago at 909 North Michigan Avenue, one of the corridor\u2019s biggest recent lodging trades.\nThe Chestnut Street property has had a turbulent few years. It housed\nMike Ditka\u2019s\nlongtime namesake restaurant, a neighborhood fixture that closed in early 2020 after more than two decades, shortly after the hotel \u2014 then operating under the Selina brand \u2014 shut down as a result of the pandemic, according to the outlet.\nIndianapolis-based Hotel Capital owned the vacant property when it was hit with a $25 million foreclosure lawsuit in 2023 by a lender affiliated with\nLaSalle Investment Management\n. After the legal process played out,\nthe city leased the building\nin 2023 and 2024 as a temporary homeless shelter to help absorb an influx of migrants and a shortage of beds for unhoused residents. The shelter closed in September 2024.\nLaSalle Investment Management seized the property through a judicial sale last fall and sold it to Avasa. The $13.2 million acquisition was financed with a $10 million loan from Millennium Bank, records show. Paramount Lodging Advisors\u2019 Sanjeev Misra represented the seller.\nAvasa Hospitality, based in Elk Grove Village, has five suburban Chicago hotels in its portfolio as well as experience in hotel design and management, according to their website. The firm has not said what it plans to do with the Tremont or when it might reopen.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The nonprofit plans to permanently conserve the land, which includes the planned quarry site and other land that had been set aside for development.\nPeninsula Open Space Trust grows its holdings at Sargent Ranch with the latest purchase. In May, the nonprofit\npurchased 2,490 acres\nof land at the ranch. The previous October, the trust bought the adjacent 1,340-acre Pescadero Ranch, which was previously part of the Sargent Ranch. Peninsula Open Space Trust made the latest acquisition with financial help from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, Land Trust of Santa Cruz County and other unnamed donors. The nonprofit now owns 6,114 acres of the 6,500-acre ranch and is in contract to buy the remaining acreage later this year.\nSargent Ranch Partners LLC, an investor group led by\nSan Diego\nbusinessman Howard Justus that previously owned the land, sought to develop a 403-acre mining operation at the ranch to extract 38 million tons of sand and gravel over 30 years. The proposal faced fierce backlash from locals out of concern for noise, congestion and damage to the landscape. The developer hasn\u2019t officially killed its quarry plan, though the sale of the property is likely the end of that endeavor. Owners also had floated various commercial ventures at the location, including hotels, golf courses and a casino.\nThe region\u2019s\nNative American\ncommunity, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, helped lead efforts to stop development on the land, which they call Juristac. The group has expressed interest in owning and managing portions of the site. The Amah Mutsun\u2019s land trust recently acquired 50 acres south of Sargent Ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A long-simmering grievance among homeowners is hardening into a national political push to eliminate property taxes on primary residences altogether.\nRising assessments have juiced tax payments across the country, and Republican lawmakers in several states are now floating plans that would upend one of local government\u2019s core revenue streams \u2014 with sweeping implications for housing, schools and municipal finance, the Associated Press\nreported\n. The movement is gaining traction in oil-rich North Dakota and Sun Belt growth states alike.\nNorth Dakota Republicans said they are already on a path to zeroing out homeowner property taxes by tapping the state\u2019s $13.4 billion oil tax savings account. In Georgia, House Republicans this week rolled out a plan to phase out most homeowner property taxes by 2032. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis embraced a similar goal, while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to eliminate property taxes that fund schools, the outlet reported.\nTexas has been using its surplus funds to finance property tax reductions. In November, Texas voters increased the state\u2019s\nhomestead exemption\n\u2014 the portion of a home\u2019s value shielded from school property taxes \u2014 from $100,000 to $140,000. That translates to roughly $490 in annual savings for the owner of a typical $302,000 Texas home,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nFollowing the vote, Abbott launched his reelection campaign in November by pitching a six-point plan that would slash appraisal growth, restrict local spending and give voters far greater control over tax increases.\nAccording to Abbott, the Legislature\u2019s record $51 billion allocation for tax relief in 2025 was blunted by local governments raising their own levies. Abbott now wants to\ntie local spending growth\nto 3.5 percent, or population growth plus inflation, whichever is lower, and by extending the state\u2019s debt and deficit limits to counties, cities and school districts.\nProperty taxes generate billions \u2014 or tens of billions \u2014 annually in most states, underwriting K-12 schools, police and fire departments and basic municipal services. Replacing that revenue without\ngutting services\nwould require higher sales taxes, new fees or deep spending cuts.\nIn Georgia, House Speaker Jon Burns wants to wipe out $5.2 billion in homeowner property taxes, more than a quarter of the state\u2019s total property tax haul in 2024. Cities, counties and school districts would be pushed to lean on existing or newly approved sales taxes, capped at a combined local rate of 5 percent on top of the state\u2019s 4 percent. The plan would also allow local governments to bill homeowners separately for services like garbage pickup and fire protection \u2014 fees lawmakers insist are not taxes.\n\u201cNo one should ever face the loss of their home because they can\u2019t pay rent to the government,\u201d Burns said as he unveiled his plan.\nThe appeal is obvious for real estate, as property taxes are often baked into housing affordability calculations, and sharp increases have been especially painful for retirees and owners who have paid off their mortgages. In fast-growing metros, tax relief could buoy home values and reduce pressure to sell, according to the publication.\nBut policy analysts warn the cure could be worse than the disease, as past revolts, like California\u2019s Proposition 13, reshaped development patterns and constrained local budgets for decades. Critics cited by the outlet said that eliminating\nhomeowner taxes\nrisks shifting the burden onto renters, commercial property owners or consumers through higher sales taxes.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s approach \u2014 using state oil revenues to subsidize local governments \u2014 is the cleanest case, but it\u2019s also the hardest to replicate. The outlet reported that elsewhere, proposals face political hurdles, constitutional amendments and voter approval.\nThe property tax revolt is back, but whether it becomes law \u2014 or just another campaign-season promise \u2014 will determine who really pays for the American home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

BridgeInvest is providing a $57 million construction loan for the 313-unit development that will be built at 9402 Frisco Street, according to a news release from the lender. The financing works out to about $182,000 per unit.\nAn undisclosed portion of the units will be available at\naffordable rates\n, as part of the project\u2019s partnership with the Housing Authority of the City of Frisco. The developer team did a sale-leaseback with the organization and entered into a ground lease, property records show.\nPublic-private partnerships have been critical to getting projects to pencil while institutional lending is harder to access.\nPlus, Frisco\u2019s rapid growth insulates projects from the region\u2019s multifamily headwinds. The average monthly rent for Dallas-Fort Worth multifamily projects was down 0.4 percent from the second to the third quarter of 2025 to $1,541 per month, according to a recent report from CBRE. Frisco, a city of more than 200,000 people about 30 miles north of Dallas, is a consistently strong submarket, thanks to its population growth. In 2024, its population jumped 6.9 percent, BridgeInvest\u2019s release shows.\nThe combination of public funding and high-growth submarket is the same recipe JPI recently used to help finance the development of Jefferson Ownsby, a 436-unit apartment complex it\u2019s building in Celina. JPI landed $23.5 million in\nC-PACE funding\n, the state policy-enabled green lending program, for the project at 317 East Ownsby Parkway.\nStryker Properties is a multifamily syndicator based in Plano. Griffon Capital Management is an apartment developer based in Corpus Christi.\n",

According to the outlet, the plan also called for demolishing and relocating the site\u2019s iconic 750-foot radio tower and its 250-foot backup, while keeping the small transmitter building intact.\nThose plans have since evolved, as Johnson said Nexstar is now envisioning four data center buildings spread across a larger portion of the site and no longer needs to replace the old towers, as radio transmission can be handled through other means. Nexstar declined to detail the revised plan, but said WGN listeners would not lose over-the-air or online service.\nWhen the property was annexed into Elk Grove Village in July 2023, Nexstar signed a redevelopment agreement laying out a phased construction schedule, landscaping buffers and flood control protections for nearby homes, as well as the pickleball courts. Under that deal, construction of the first data center was supposed to begin within two years \u2014 a deadline that has now passed.\nJohnson, an outspoken champion of\ndata centers\n, told the outlet that\nElk Grove Village\nalready hosts 15 facilities, with another 17 proposed. He previously steered Nexstar away from a trucking and logistics concept, arguing data centers would be a better fit next to\nresidential neighborhoods\n.\nA solution to the power situation constraints is progressing. Earlier this month, the village agreed to sell a vacant 1.2-acre parcel at 300 East Devon Avenue to Commonwealth Edison for about $3.6 million. Johnson said the utility has contracts on five neighboring parcels, signaling groundwork for the infrastructure needed to finally bring the data center campus to life.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The former principal of DJE Texas Management Group agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, capping a fast-moving collapse of a once-active Texas real estate investment firm and setting up a major restitution payment for defrauded investors.\nSan Antonio-based syndicator Devin Elder reached a plea agreement with the U.S. government in the Western District of Texas, according to court filings. While the terms of the deal remain under seal, the documents state that Elder will be required to repay roughly $66 million to investors, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The FBI opened a criminal investigation into DJE in 2025, prompting federal authorities to pause a parallel civil case in favor of the\ncriminal probe\n.\nIn charging documents filed Wednesday, prosecutors allege Elder solicited investors nationwide by pitching 10 percent returns and touting conservative deal structures, including claims that properties would be acquired without debt and that investor funds would not be commingled between projects. Prosecutors say those representations were false.\nInstead, Elder allegedly used a bank account under the name \u201cDJE Equity 01, LLC\u201d to disguise the source and movement of investor funds, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The outlet reported that the government said Elder and DJE used new investor money to make so-called interest payments and other distributions to earlier investors, creating the appearance of successful projects while allegedly concealing cash shortfalls and misuse of funds \u2014 a playbook prosecutors said helped lure additional capital.\nRed flags began surfacing publicly in April 2025, when Elder told investors he planned to lay off staff and sell assets in response to economic headwinds. DJE hired an outside\nconsultant\nto wind down operations, but multiple investors later told the publication that communication had broken down and they feared their capital was gone.\nIn July, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\nfiled a warrant\nto seize about 1,000 acres of land tied to DJE across six South Texas counties.\nThe criminal case landed on top of a growing pile of lawsuits from vendors and investors alleging breach of contract and fraud. In one high-profile dispute, a buyer of an apartment complex formerly owned by DJE \u2014 Denver-based Platte Canyon Capital \u2014 accused Elder of\nsiphoning rents\nand misrepresenting the property\u2019s financial condition.\nA court hearing has not yet been scheduled. Elder and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A sprawling warehouse on San Antonio\u2019s East Side once billed as the city\u2019s largest industrial development might be headed for an unusual new buyer: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nICE is considering acquiring Oakmont 410, a 639,595-square-foot warehouse at 542 Southeast Loop 410, according to sources\ncited\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The building, completed in 2022 and owned by Oakmont Industrial Group, has sat vacant despite nearly three years on the lease market.\nMultiple real estate sources told the outlet that\nICE\nis expected to close on the property imminently, though no transaction has yet to be recorded in Bexar County records. Oakmont and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. The property is marketed by Partners Real Estate, whose brokers declined to comment.\nIf the deal goes through, it would align with\nICE\u2019s broader nationwide push\nto secure \u201csubstantially large\u201d warehouse facilities for detainee processing and detention. Another source told the publication that a private contractor is handling site selection for\nICE\n, with one in McAllen also under consideration.\nSimilar searches have surfaced elsewhere: the Kansas City Business Journal recently reported that ICE was evaluating a 920,400-square-foot warehouse there, following a December Washington Post report on the agency\u2019s hunt for warehouse-style facilities across the country.\nD Magazine confirmed a planned\n1-million-square-foot detention\ncenter in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas, first mentioned in that Washington Post report. The warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, is capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland.\nThe Oakmont building\u2019s zoning could complicate matters. While it carries an industrial designation, that zoning does not allow human occupancy, meaning a special use permit from the city would likely be required if the facility were converted to house detainees, according to the publication. The property did receive a zoning verification letter from the city in December, a common step ahead of a potential sale.\nLocal officials are already signaling resistance. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert, who represents the area, said he was unaware of ICE\u2019s interest, but forcefully opposed the idea, calling detention facilities \u201cthe most disreputable commercial activity since WWII\u201d and vowing to fight any such use. A spokesperson for District 2 Councilmember Jalen McKee-Rodriguez declined to comment, labeling the reports speculative.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Soon thereafter, they applied for and received city approval to\ndemolish the home\nand build a new residence from the ground up. In 2024, city officials\ndesignated Monroe\u2019s former home\na\nLos Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument\nafter Milstein and Bank\u2019s permits were already approved.\n\u201cIn doing so, the city has turned the property into a tourist attraction, attracting (as the city wanted and expected) traffic congestion on the short, narrow dead-end street adjacent to the property along with numerous trespassers leaping over and onto property walls to get into the \u201cdesignated\u201d house (which cannot be seen from the public realm due to the property wall and landscaping),\u201d the court filings state, according to the Post.\nAs a result of the heightened interest around the home, the homeowners claim that burglars searching for memorabilia broke into the home in November. They even had to hire their own private security for the property.\nMilstein and Bank said that the city never worked to deem the building historically significant in the decades since Monroe\u2019s death after it changed hands multiple times and underwent several renovations. By declaring the structure a historic-cultural monument, the city \u201crendered the property useless,\u201d the couple said.\nThe homeowners are asking the court to either allow them to proceed with their demolition plans or force the city to pay them the value of the home. Last September, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge\nsided with city officials\nin blocking Milstein and Bank\u2019s request to demolish the home.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Even an office building built for pandemic realities isn\u2019t immune to tenant downsizing.\nCosmetic laser company Alma Lasers listed its 10,600 square-foot space on the fifth floor of the office building called Fulton East in Chicago\u2019s trendy Fulton Market neighborhood. The lease has three years remaining, according to the Cushman &amp; Wakefield listing for the space.\nThe downsizing is the first setback for the building at 215 North Peoria Street, owned and developed by Chicago-based Parkside Realty. In 2020, the newly completed Fulton East building made headlines for incorporating high-tech, health-focused amenities to combat the spread of Covid, such as full building air purification, touchless elevators and antibacterial interior paint.\nThe building\u2019s scale and location were also well-suited to shifts in office trends. At 12 stories and 90,000 square feet, Fulton East is generally easier to fill than the massive skyscrapers languishing in the Chicago loop, like the city\u2019s largest office building,\nthe Willis Tower\n.\nFulton East first reached\nfull occupancy in June 2023\n.\nAlma Lasers, a subsidiary of Israel-based Sisram Medical Group, hired Chicago-based general contractor Redmond to build out space on the first and ninth floors of the Fulton East building in 2023. The first floor is an Alma-owned MedSpa called Sisram Wellness Center, and the ninth floor serves as space for the company\u2019s corporate offices. Alma later hired Redmond again to build out additional office space on the fifth floor, according to Redmond\u2019s website.\nThe status of the fifth floor work is unclear. Redmond\u2019s website describes fifth floor construction as completed in 2025, but the Cushman &amp; Wakefield sublease listing posted earlier this month states that the space is \u201ccurrently under construction.\u201d\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jeffrey Skender and Jonathan Metzl are representing the landlord. Skender, Metzl and representatives of Alma, Redmond and Parkside did not respond to requests for comment.\nOver the past 10 years, Fulton Market has transformed from a meatpacking hub to a mixed-use district filled with loft office space and trendy bars, restaurants and stores. As a result, it leads the city in office leasing, as tenants search for buildings that draw employees out of the home office with amenities and nearby attractions. In the last quarter of 2025, Fulton Market had a 16.8 percent vacancy rate, compared to a 26.6 percent vacancy rate in the city overall, according to CBRE.\nYet, since the pandemic, some\ntenants have been scaling back\nin the trendy neighborhood.\nHealthcare software company Waystar and employer review platform Glassdoor\nboth listed a combined 63,000 square feet\nof sublease space in Fulton Market in early 2024.\nOther companies that listed sublease space in the neighborhood around the same time included\npublic relations firm WPP\n, upscale coffee and snack retailer Foxtrot, tech company Hologram,\nadvisory firm Kroll\nand food packaging company\nHazel Technologies\n.\nStill, interest from prospective new tenants remains high.\nMcLean, Virginia-based candy giant\nMars reached an agreement\nto lease a large space at Trammell Crow\u2019s office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market last month. Those familiar with the deal said the company is expected to lease over 100,000 square feet of space.",

The firm isn\u2019t moving far from its current 40,000 square feet at the KPMG Building next door at 55 Second Street.\nIntercom was reportedly expected to renew its lease at 55 Second Street, according to sources close to the matter cited by the Business Times. Paramount Group, a Manhattan-based investor that operates the building, reportedly couldn\u2019t keep up with its timeline for completing the renewal, leading Intercom to sign the lease at 85 Second, per the Business Times.\nThe AI firm\u2019s departure from 55 Second Street marks the latest exit from the building.\nKPMG, the building\u2019s namesake tenant, announced in late 2024 that it planned to move out of the structure in September this year. The professional services firm will relocate into a new 96,296-square-foot space at 505 Howard Street, the Business Times\nreported\n. Workforce management software company Rippling signed a lease to shift its headquarters to 430 California Street from 55 Second in June 2024.\nThe 380,000-square-foot 55 Second Street is backed by a $187.5 million loan that matures in October. Last year, Paramount\u2019s lenders\nlisted the debt for sale\n, though no deal for the loan has emerged yet.\nAI companies like Intercom have been key players in\ndriving demand for office space\nin post-pandemic San Francisco. Earlier this week, news surfaced that Decagon, another AI-powered customer service company, is\nin negotiations\nto lease approximately 70,000 square feet at 680 Folsom Street.\nOverall, vacant or available office space in San Francisco decreased by nearly 2 million square feet last quarter, making for the steepest\ndrop in office availability\nin four consecutive quarters of decline. Companies, many of them tech and AI firms, leased more than 1 million more square feet that they vacated in the fourth quarter, marking the biggest rate of positive absorption since 2018.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is having a moment in Midtown, and it\u2019s not just\nabout new construction\n.\nWithin days, the Extell Development founder popped up on two very different fronts: quietly\nlocking up one of the most consequential development assemblages on Park Avenue\nand winning a court ruling that clears the way for him to\npotentially take control of a deeply distressed office tower\nowned by rivals SL Green and RXR.\nTogether, the moves underscore Barnett\u2019s playbook in a market still working through pain: lean into prime locations, exploit dislocation and don\u2019t shy away from conflict.\nOn the growth side, Barnett is\nin contract\nto buy 405-415 Park Avenue, air rights from Central Synagogue and is negotiating for the adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nSellers were shopping the pieces for north of $500 million, The Promote first reported, and the combined site could support roughly 700,000 square feet with additional air rights. The assemblage sits just steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 270 Park headquarters and near Citadel and Vornado\u2019s planned 350 Park tower, placing it squarely in the corridor where trophy office capital is concentrated.\nAt the same time, Barnett is pressing his advantage on the other end of the market. A state Supreme Court judge this week\ndenied\nSL Green and RXR\u2019s attempt to block a UCC foreclosure auction tied to Worldwide Plaza, clearing the way for Extell to move forward after quietly acquiring the senior mezzanine debt.\nThe owners had argued the auction was a sham designed to hand Barnett the keys. The judge disagreed, emphasizing that sophisticated parties are bound by the contracts they sign.\nWorldwide Plaza is a case study in office distress: roughly 40 percent vacant after Cravath\u2019s exit, burdened by nearly $1 billion in senior CMBS debt and now headed toward a mezz sale where Extell is the only qualified bidder. Control of the debt would give Barnett enormous leverage over the 1.8 million-square-foot tower\u2019s future.\nTaken together, the Park Avenue assemblage and the Worldwide Plaza fight show Barnett operating on two tracks at once \u2014 assembling blue-chip dirt for the next cycle while using debt to pry opportunities out of this one.\nIn a bifurcated Midtown market, he\u2019s betting both ends will pay off.\nGary Barnett isn\u2019t the only one making news in New York City real estate this week. Here are other top stories of the week:\n\u201cCheap hookers\u201d: Email from Tal Alexander revealed in Hamptons accuser\u2019s cross-examination\nThe third day of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial focused on the cross-examination of Maya Miller, a woman who accused Tal Alexander of raping her in the Hamptons in 2014.\nProsecutors allege Oren, Alon and Tal engaged in a\nconspiracy to commit sex trafficking\nfrom 2008 to 2021, including drugging and sexually assaulting women. The brothers have denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nAlso, check out\nthe first episode\nof our documentary on the Alexander brothers.\nFictitious deals and phony emails: New Nussbaum filings lay bare alleged Ponzi scheme\nDisgraced attorney Mark Nussbaum admitted in legal filings to diverting $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner and his family between 2022 and 2025 as part of an alleged Ponzi scheme.\nThe filings reveal Nussbaum directly transferred $24 million to Steiner or his family\u2019s companies, and an additional $68 million was routed to his family via Steiner\u2019s companies, Aven Realty and Real Green Management, which also paid Nussbaum $104 million.\nCarmel Partners buys piece of $500M UWS apartment portfolio\nRon Zeff\u2019s Carmel Partners is buying into a $500 million\nmultifamily portfolio\nthat was pitched as an investment shielded from a potential\nrent freeze\nunder Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nThe investment firm is nearing a deal to buy MetLife\u2019s minority stake in a five-building, 710-unit portfolio near Columbus Circle. Four of the five buildings are free market and the fifth is subject to an\nolder 421a agreement\nunder which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting legal rent limits.\nEli Karp sues Greystone, BBG over alleged \u201cloan-to-own\u201d appraisal scheme\nDeveloper Eli Karp is suing lender Greystone and appraisal firm BBG, alleging they engineered a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme by intentionally overvaluing his 271 Lenox Road apartment building.\nThe suit claims BBG\u2019s 2019 appraisal of $46.2 million was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan; a subsequent 2024 appraisal valued the property at $29.6 million, which Karp uses as evidence of fraudulent inflation.\nAfter defaulting, the property sold at foreclosure for $10 million, leaving Karp responsible for a $15 million personal guarantee.\nHe is seeking $16.6 million in damages for the alleged appraisal inflation and an additional $122 million from Greystone for lost opportunities.\nCouncil revives two housing regulation bills, COPA remains vetoed\nFinally, the City Council overrode 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, including two housing regulation bills that set minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units in city-financed projects.\nThe Council, however, did not override the veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, though the bill\u2019s sponsor plans to reintroduce the measure.\nOther vetoes reversed included measures to set minimum wages for building security guards, increase transparency in the co-op application process and create a city-run land bank.\n",

        "content": "With fresh snow piled high and temperatures below freezing, reporters with\nThe Real Deal\ntrudged to a Lower Manhattan courthouse this week to watch the Alexanders brothers\u2019 federal sex trafficking unfold.\nThe proceedings marked the culmination of nearly two years of reporting on allegations that disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and Oren\u2019s twin brother, Alon Alexander, sexually assaulted multiple women. The brothers were arrested in December 2024 on federal sex trafficking charges and have remained in custody at a Brooklyn jail since January 2025.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far.\nProsecutors with the Southern District of New York\nkicked off Tuesday\nwith an opening statement detailing their case against the brothers, including accusing them of working together between 2008 and 2021 to lure women to destinations like the Hamptons and the Bahamas with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences. However, once the women arrived, they were sexually assaulted and, in some cases, drugged by one or more of the brothers, prosecutors allege.\nDefense attorneys pushed back against prosecutors\u2019 characterization of the brothers\u2019 lifestyle, arguing instead that the brothers\u2019 womanizing behavior was \u201ccrude\u201d but not criminal. They also challenged prosecutors\u2019 allegations that the Alexanders drugged women to attack them, pointing to a lack of toxicology or medical reports to corroborate accusers\u2019 claims. (\n about opening statements here\n.)\nTwo women took the stand this week. One testified on Tuesday under the pseudonym \u201cKatie Moore\u201d to describe how she met Tal and Alon at a 2012 NBA Championships watch party at actor Zac Efron\u2019s apartment before she was drugged while at a nightclub with the brothers. She told the court she blacked out and woke up naked in a bed with Alon standing over her. She said he laughed when she told him she didn\u2019t want to have sex and told her she already had. She alleges he then raped her again. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nOn Wednesday,\na woman using the pseudonym \u201cMaya Miller\u201d recounted her claim that she was drugged and raped by Tal in the Hamptons in August 2014. She claimed that on her second night at a weekend trip in a Sag Harbor mansion, she felt the mood shift and began to fear for her and her friend\u2019s safety. As Miller was trying to leave the next morning, she claimed Tal cornered her in the shower and raped her. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nAttorneys representing the defendants cross-examined each alleged victim, questioning both women on who they told and when, including pressing Miller on why she didn\u2019t seek help from her friend, who was in the bathroom while she was allegedly being attacked by Tal in the shower.\nAttorneys also questioned the women about their alcohol consumption, including their prior habits and leading up to the alleged rapes. Howard Srebnick, an attorney for Alon, asked Moore several questions about the \u201clittle bit\u201d of MDMA she admitted to taking early on in the night.\nBy Thursday, the proceedings\nhad touched on allegations concerning\neach of the three brothers, including the start of testimony related to a sexual exploitation of a minor charge that Oren is facing over an alleged rape in 2009 captured on video. Prosecutors wrapped up the week by walking jurors through a series of photos and videos taken on the night of the alleged attack.\nThe Alexanders, their attorneys and\nTRD\nwill be back in the courtroom on Monday, when the woman depicted in the video is expected to testify.\nNot so fast\u2026\nBrooklyn\u2019s ultra-luxury market\nhit a growth spurt\nlast year, though it\u2019s still trailing behind its golden years following the pandemic.\nIn 2025, the borough notched 12 deals for $10 million or more, up 50 percent from 8 the previous year, according to\nCompass\u2019 annual report\n. The sales totaled $143 million, up 34 percent year-over-year from $107 million.\nDespite the uptick, the market is still down from 2022, a banner year for Brooklyn\u2019s luxury deals as buyers flocked to the outer boroughs in the wake of the pandemic. That year, 13 deals closed for homes priced at $10 million or more for a volume of more than $170 million.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for two adjacent townhouses in the West Village. New York University\u2019s Law School sold the pair of properties at 63 and 65 Charles Street for $33.4 million. The buyer was an anonymous LLC with an address in the Cayman Islands.\n",

        "content": "New York City is a dangerous place for birds.\nFor the second year in a row, a record number of migrating birds were killed after flying headfirst into the city\u2019s nearly invisible skyline, according to the\nNew York Post\n. At least 1,250 warblers, flickers and other birds died during their annual fall migration, surpassing last year\u2019s grim record of nearly 1,000. And conservationists say the true toll is likely far higher, thanks to an unusually heavy migration season that sent thousands more birds through the five boroughs.\nCity Hall has come up with at least one answer \u2014 bird-friendly glass. In 2021, Local Law 15 went into effect, requiring most new buildings and major renovations to use bird-safe materials on 90 percent of their facade up to the first 75 feet, the danger zone where birds are most likely to collide with glass.\nThe idea is simple \u2014 make buildings visible to birds and fewer of them will die. On paper, it\u2019s hard to argue with that. Fewer dead birds is a clear win.\nBut the law also comes with a price tag, and that\u2019s where the debate gets complicated. Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau recently pointed to an affordable housing project he\u2019s building at Willets Point, where complying with the bird-glass requirement will cost roughly $2 million. Those extra costs, Blau argued, could otherwise go toward building more apartments. The development is subsidized by the city, he added, so it\u2019s helping foot the bill.\n\u201cThe city is paying the money for bird glass instead of more affordable apartments,\u201d Blau said at last month\u2019s NYU Schack capital markets conference. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable tradeoff. Saving wildlife is important. So is building housing in a city with a chronic shortage. When the same public dollars are funding both, it\u2019s fair to ask whether the policy is delivering the biggest bang for its buck.\nConservation advocates counter that prices for bird-friendly glass have fallen as demand has grown, and that the upfront cost can help building owners avoid expensive repairs from bird collisions or the potential cost to retrofit existing buildings. The Council introduced a new bill in 2024 that would require most landlords to comply with bird-friendly standards in existing buildings by 2030.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a challenge in a city like this, with housing so scarce and the need for affordable housing so great,\u201d said Jessica Wilson of NYC Bird Alliance. \u201cThere are many benefits to protecting birds and saving biodiversity, including improving human health and mental well-being.\u201d\nGlass is one of several threats to birds. Advocates support complementary measures like turning off unused lights at night to reduce bird deaths. Public education about lighting rules or even investing in habitat restoration could arguably save more birds per dollar spent, but conservationists argue that these broader strategies don\u2019t replace the need for bird-friendly building measures.\n\u201cBirds and biodiversity are a critical part of a sustainable and resilient city, and when you make the city better for wildlife, [you] make it healthier and a better place for people also,\u201d Wilson said.\nNone of this is an argument against protecting wildlife. New York can love birds and build housing at the same time. The question is whether bird glass, as currently mandated, is the smartest way to do both.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAI voice analytics company Rilla inked a 57,000-square-foot lease this month at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin Williamsburg in one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. Leases of that size are rare for Class A buildings in the borough, where last year\u2019s\nbiggest signings\nlargely landed in Class B and C towers. Could the AI boom finally give Brooklyn\u2019s top-tier office market a lift? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nSome people have pet nannies. I know this because a listing for a full-time nanny for a four-year-old Lagotto Romagnolo in my Brooklyn neighborhood recently surfaced on my Instagram feed. The link led to the profile page for staffing agency\nHousehold Staffing\n, where I found multiple listings for pet nannies, both live-in and live-out.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 President Trump announced on Friday that he has picked lawyer and former Federal Reserve official Kevin Warsh to be the next chairman of the central bank, according to the\nNew York Times\n. If confirmed, Warsh would succeed Jerome Powell, who has faced attacks from Trump over his reluctance to cut interest rates more aggressively. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May.\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani has called an AI chatbot released by the Adams administration \u201cfunctionally unusable,\u201d\nreports\nThe City. The software was intended to provide business owners with information about city rules and other pertinent information. Previous reporting found the chatbot giving erroneous information that could have caused businesses to make illegal decisions. Now, Mamdani says his administration is axing the program as part of cost-cutting.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$9.9 million\nfor 211 West 84th Street, 5C.

        "content": "Sometimes when the lights come on at the club, you finally see just who you were dancing with.\nThat\u2019s how unsecured creditors of bankrupt nightclub Brooklyn Mirage might be feeling. The group pulled its support for a bankruptcy plan that would have\nsold the venue\nto Axar Capital Management LLC after finding out the debt fund had struck a deal with a third party. The withdrawal was first reported by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe unsecured creditors appear to have first heard about the deal in the pages of BKMAG, which\nreported\non New Year\u2019s Day that Axar was expecting to enter a deal with global nightlife brand Pacha and its parent FIVE to sell the Mirage and turn it into Pacha New York. BKMAG attributed the information to an anonymous industry source.\nThe about-face by creditors is the latest twist in a saga that seemed to finally be coming to an end. The popular venue Brooklyn Mirage, owned by the company Avant Gardner, began undergoing a comprehensive renovation in 2024. It sold a season of tickets for the following year and then canceled every show. The debacle ultimately ended in Avant Gardner\u2019s parent company filing for bankruptcy last August, reporting $153.3 million in funded debt obligations.\nAn Axar affiliate won court approval in October to buy the Mirage stage and other assets from Avant Gardner in a $110 million credit bid, according to Bloomberg Law. Creditors would get a payout if Axar was able to reach a certain monetary threshold.\nAxar, meanwhile, allegedly negotiated the deal with Pacha\u2019s parent in the dark, away from the eyes of creditors and the court.\nAfter learning of\nthe plans in the news\n, the creditors approached Axar\u2019s counsel, who allegedly said the reports were incorrect, although discussions were allegedly ongoing. Then, on January 12, the creditors\u2019 attorney was allegedly told the deal was all but done.\nThe creditors will not sign off on any plan that permits the \u201ctrickery Axar has attempted,\u201d they wrote to the court. The deal \u201cdestroys the value\u201d of parts of the plan and Axar hasn\u2019t permitted the terms of the deal to be shared with the Delaware bankruptcy court or with the Mirage parent\u2019s board of directors.\nThe affiliate\u2019s deal with Pacha and its parent FIVE includes a purchase option that, if exercised, would wipe out a potential payout to the unsecured creditors. The creditors include vendors and artists who worked with the club.\nAxar has asked the court to determine that the creditors are unreasonably withholding their support. Axar is pursuing the demolition and rebuilding of the Mirage, but needs a partner to finance the process as well as $2 million in monthly costs for the closed stages.\nThe creditors can\u2019t turn around and fight a plan they once endorsed just because their assumption that they would get a payout turned out to be false, Axar argued to the court.\n\u201c[N]o party submitted a proposal valuing the enterprise higher than the offer from the venue management firm,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis is the unfortunate reality all of the parties have to live with.\u201d\nAxar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Avant Gardner complex that included the Mirage was one of the largest clubs in New York, at 80,000 square feet. The Mirage opened in East Williamsburg in 2017 and became a popular venue for electronic music, despite fights with the state liquor license authority and community board.\nIn 2024, the company brought on new CEO Josh Wyatt to manage a revamp of the Mirage stage. The club closed for what was supposed to be a massive renovation. But just before it was supposed to open for a full summer of shows, the city\u2019s buildings department yanked its permit.\nAlthough Mirage owners said the venue was show-ready, the buildings commissioner told Brooklyn Paper the revamp was \u201ccombustible\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d As shows were canceled, 90,000 ticketholders were left at least temporarily in the lurch. Wyatt was fired in May of 2025, and Avant Gardner filed for bankruptcy three months later.\nA confirmation hearing for the bankruptcy plan is currently scheduled for February 12.\n",

        "content": "IMC Equity Group bought a Princeton apartment complex for nearly 24 percent less than its sale price four years ago, as the investment firm capitalizes on distress in South Florida.\nNorth Miami-based IMC Equity, led by Yoram Izhak, bought the 204-unit garden-style Pine Groves at 24101 South Dixie Highway in unincorporated Miami-Dade County from an entity led by Elliot Kazarnovsky of Toronto-based Marlin Spring Developments, according to records.\nIMC Equity borrowed a $27.8 million loan from Wells Fargo for the purchase and property.\nCompleted in 2020, Pine Groves consists of four three-story buildings and a clubhouse on a nearly 6-acre lot, property records show. It has one- and two-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $1,635 to $1,925.\nThe Kazarnovsky-led entity, which is in the care of Marlin Spring US Realty, bought Pine Groves from the developer in 2021 for $44 million.\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, increases in other costs and a slower South Florida multifamily market compared with the pandemic-induced boom.\nThe elevated rates have translated to higher debt obligations for landlords with floating-rate loans and more expensive refinancing for those with maturing loans. At the same time, South Florida has experienced skyrocketing insurance premiums and stabilizing though still-high costs for labor and materials.\nMeanwhile, demand for rentals has cooled. After South Florida became a magnet for out-of-staters, creating unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth, developers rushed to build multifamily. They completed a record 18,600 units last year, outpacing net leasing, just as the influx of residents slowed, prompting a decrease in rents and an increase in concessions.\nSome multifamily properties have traded at a discount. In September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit District West Gables complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for $111 million, a\n4.7 percent\ndiscount from what it had paid nearly a decade ago.\nIMC Equity is among the firms seizing on the distress playing out in multifamily and other property types. It bought the 515,000-square-foot Sawgrass Technology Park in Sunrise for\n$49 million\nin 2024, marking a 34 percent discount from its 2019 price.\u00a0It also bagged the Miracle Marketplace at 3301 Coral Way in Miami in 2024 for\n$62 million\n, or 32.6 percent less than the retail center\u2019s price over a decade prior.\n",

        "content": "Embattled South Side home flipper Chris Urban clapped back against the storm of foreclosures surrounding dozens of his properties in legal filings this month, as more lenders took him to court over unpaid debts.\nUrban and his sister, Aneta Urban, have been named in a\ngrowing number of foreclosures\nand lawsuits related to a portfolio of dozens of properties across Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs that started to buckle under the weight of unpaid debts in 2024. The pair borrowed money from fellow investors in a real estate training program run by Andrew Holmes, who is\nalso suing them for fraud\n.\nIn filings across several lawsuits in January, the Urbans argued their lenders failed to credit payments received, either directly or indirectly, to reduce the amount the Urbans owed the lenders. The filings argue the amount the Urbans owe should be offset by any money the lenders received from selling any collateral or other payments from the Urbans.\nAlthough the Urbans didn\u2019t provide proof of payments to the lenders, they denied the amount that the lenders claim is owed and demanded \u201cstrict proof\u201d of the accounting in the filings.\nThe argument reflects the precarious financing of the Urbans\u2019 portfolio. As financial troubles mounted in 2024 and 2025, Chris Urban used short sales to give lenders partial payments while using other properties as collateral for unpaid debts,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. In other cases, Urban would sell a home from one LLC to another he operates, satisfying one mortgage while taking out another for the purchase, property records show.\nThe defense comes as the Urbans are facing foreclosures on more than 80 properties between lender Renovo Financial and a handful of private lenders, amounting to millions in debt. While some lawsuits from early last year have been resolved, foreclosure suits continued to pile up late last year.\nMeanwhile, business loan company OnDeck Capital brought a third lawsuit for unpaid debt against one of Urban\u2019s LLCs in November. American Express also filed a lawsuit against the same LLC, and a separate one against Chris Urban personally, alleging he defaulted on debt, in January.\nChris Urban declined to comment, saying he would resolve the disputes \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nNew foreclosure\nSince mid-October, lenders have brought two more lawsuits against the Urbans for alleged unpaid debts. In both cases, the Urbans filed the same defenses, arguing the lenders did not credit any repayment they had received to the loan balance.\nIn October, Shirley Pollock, through her LLC Best Funding Solutions, filed to foreclose on five properties in Chicago and Calumet Park where she loaned the Urbans money. Pollock\u2019s lawsuit claims the combined unpaid debt, including late fees, amounts to more than $1 million across the five properties.\nAt three of those homes, the Urbans took out second mortgages between $50,000 and $65,000 with two other lenders \u2014 Homes by MB and Misener Wealth Builder \u2014 that are also named as defendants.\nIt\u2019s the second foreclosure suit from Pollock, following a lawsuit earlier that same month alleging unpaid debts of almost $500,000 across three properties.\nShe is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit brought by Holmes and his business partner, Mary DeSloover, alleging fraud. That\nlawsuit argues Pollock aided\nthe Urbans in covering up their financial pitfalls as they took on more debt from other investors. Pollock has denied the charge and said she is also a victim of the Urbans in legal filings.\nPollock did not respond to a request for comment.\nOlmos Private Equity\nAnother lender, Edmund Olmos, is also moving to seize two of Chris Urban\u2019s properties through foreclosure.\nThrough his LLC, Olmos Private Equity, Olmos issued Urban a $150,000 mortgage for a home on Burley Avenue and $236,000 for a home on 88th street in 2023 and 2024. The lawsuit alleges Urban failed to pay back the loans when they matured, and the balance has grown to more than $468,000.\nUrban took out a second mortgage at both those properties, records show. Olmos issued mortgages to the Urbans on more than a dozen properties between 2023 and 2024, often as second mortgages, property records show.\nMitchell Lieberman, an attorney for Olmos Private Equity and other investors foreclosing on the Urbans\u2019 properties, did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
