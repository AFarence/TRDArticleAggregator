        "content": "New York\u2019s CityFHEPS voucher program has a $1.2 billion price tag. Now, the state comptroller wants less of that money going to \u201cbad\u201d landlords.\nIn an audit of the program released Friday, the comptroller\u2019s office found that the city approved units with infestations and other serious concerns for participation in the program. And some tenants have used their vouchers to pay landlords on the city\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nAs such, the comptroller recommended that the program establish a \u201clandlord disqualification\u201d list.\nThe audit is the latest public criticism of the rental assistance program, which serves mostly formerly homeless New Yorkers, and is a source of income to private landlords. Disqualifying specific landlords from the program would cut them off from that income stream.\nThe state comptroller\u2019s office reviewed 45 CityFHEPS cases in the five boroughs. Of those, three had open housing code violations classified as \u201cimmediately hazardous,\u201d including infestations.\nThat\u2019s not only not a great situation for tenants, it\u2019s expensive, the report argued. For audited voucher recipients who ultimately had to move, the program had to pay nearly $119,000 in new brokers\u2019 fees and landlord incentives.\nIn one case, the city\u2019s Department of Social Services approved a tenant to move into a unit with 20 open violations, including mouse and cockroach infestations. DSS paid more than $7,000 to the broker and the landlord to secure the apartment before the tenant moved in. Another CityFHEPS tenant had already been approved to move out of that unit because of similar concerns.\n\u201cLandlords continue to participate in CityFHEPS without having to rectify poor living situations,\u201d the report said.\nFurther review by the comptroller\u2019s office found DSS also approved at least 57 CityFHEPS households to use their vouchers on units owned by landlords on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nDSS said it would establish a landlord \u201cescalation\u201d list, \u201cto enable more intensive reviews of specific landlords.\u201d DSS disputed several of the report\u2019s conclusions, saying it contained several inaccuracies and doesn\u2019t highlight the successes of the program.\nIn a statement to\nGothamist\n, DSS accountability chief Bedros Boodanian blamed the habitability issues on New York\u2019s low vacancy rate.\n\u201cTenants, especially low-income households with vouchers like CityFHEPS, have very few available units from which to choose,\u201d Boodanian wrote. \u201cRestricting voucher use to only pristine landlords would shrink an already microscopic pool of available units, further delaying housing for people who need it most.\u201d\nTo the comptroller\u2019s office, DSS said The \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list lacks legal enforceability.\nThe audit identified other concerns with CityFHEPS oversight. For example, in thirty out of 75 statewide cases, there was no record of income verification. The comptroller\u2019s office recommended that DSS follow its income verification policies.\n",

Dropbox has been\nretreating from the space\nlittle by little in recent years.\nIf the deal is completed, it will bring\nOpenAI\n\u2019s presence in Mission Bay to about 1 million square feet. It also isn\u2019t the only expansion deal in the works for the ChatGPT maker. The company is currently linked to another deal at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard, though there is \u201cno confirmation of either deal closing,\u201d a source familiar with the matter told the Chronicle. It is not clear whether the firm plans to occupy both 1800 Owens and 455 Mission Bay or is deciding between the two locations.\nThe 1800 Owens complex totals approximately 750,000 square feet and is located about half a mile from OpenAI\u2019s existing offices in Mission Bay. Dropbox at one point occupied the entire building but began\nparing down its footprint\nduring the pandemic,\nsubleasing out much of the space\n.\nThe creator of ChatGPT has been on a growth spurt in Mission Bay since 2023, beginning that year with a nearly 500,000-square-foot\nsublease from Uber\nacross two buildings on Third Street and continuing the following year with a full-building lease encompassing 315,000 square feet at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. The latter deal marked one of the largest office deals in San Francisco in 2024.\nThough OpenAI\u2019s operations are concentrated in San Francisco, the ChatGPT giant is looking to grow into Silicon Valley. The company is looking to lease up to 500,000 square feet of offices in the global tech hub, reportedly touring offices in Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio is moving closer to securing a key piece of its Project Marvel vision, putting a $30 million price tag on a trio of federally-owned parcels that city leaders see as critical to reshaping downtown around a new Spurs arena and mixed-use district.\nCity officials are seeking approval to acquire three properties in and around Hemisfair, including a federal office building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard and two adjacent parking lots at 610 and 611 Indianola Street, according to documents submitted to San Antonio City Council and first\nreported\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The\nSpurs\nwould front the purchase price under a funding framework the council\napproved\nlast August as part of its broader partnership with the NBA franchise.\nThe office building, controlled by the General Services Administration, was deemed surplus and placed on the GSA\u2019s accelerated disposition list last year. Council is set to vote on the acquisition Jan. 15, following a recommendation from the Planning Commission in December. City officials estimate the federal review process would take 90 to 120 days once an offer is submitted.\nWhile the city would own the properties, the federal government is expected to remain in the office building for up to five years under a leaseback arrangement. Officials say the rental income would cover operating costs during that period. Any future redevelopment of the building would also be constrained by restrictive covenants from the Texas Historical Commission, adding a layer of complexity to long-term plans, according to the publication.\nStill, city staff have framed the acquisition as foundational to Project Marvel\u2019s ambitions. In a memo to the Planning Commission, officials said federal control of the parcels has long acted as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d between Hemisfair and surrounding streets, limiting pedestrian and vehicular access and contributing to underinvestment in nearby Tower Park.\nBringing the land under local control would allow the city to rework entrances, improve wayfinding and better integrate Hemisfair into the surrounding urban fabric, while opening the door to\nuses more consistent\nwith a dense, mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena, according to city documents.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County voters approved $311 million in\npublic funding\nfor Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The city is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization committed to $1 billion toward the district.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Last year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition, and former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final auction price was not immediately clear after the firm issued an initial bid of $451 million.\nIt\u2019s the result of Pinnacle\u2019s bankruptcy auction, in which Summit represented the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 15.\nThe auction commenced despite efforts by tenants and elected officials, most recently Mamdani\u2019s office, to delay the sale. The coalition had asked the judge in the case for more time, originally hoping that the city or a nonprofit might be able to draft a workable bid. After Summit came forward as a stalking horse bidder, the city asked for a 30-day pause to evaluate the sale to Summit and explore potential alternatives.\nHowever, the judge rejected that effort in a Wednesday hearing, clearing the way for Summit\u2019s acquisition.\nAs distress grows in the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock, the auction result shows a potential future for thousands of units across the city. Surging expenses and elevated interest rates have eaten away at revenue, at the same time that a 2019 statewide law has limited owners\u2019 abilities to raise rents. Pinnacle placed its LLCs into Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing $564 million to Flagstar Bank, according to court records.\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to New York and understand how critical the preservation of affordable housing is to the success of our City,\u201d Zohar Levy, chairman of Summit, said in a statement. \u201cWe have reached out to the City and look forward to talking with the new administration and residents about our plans to invest in the portfolio and help make New York affordable for everyone.\u201d\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. But the Mamdani administration expressed concern that Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties and maintaining rent stabilization. The bankrupt LLCs owe the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, which number more than 5,000.\nThe legal rents on the units are low enough that Summit likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nEastdil Secured advised on the auction.",

If approved by voters this November, any billionaire living in the state as of Jan. 1, 2026 would be eligible for the one-time 5 percent tax on fortunes exceeding $1 billion.\nOn Dec. 31,\nPeter Thiel\nand\nDavid Sacks\nboth publicly announced new office locations in Florida and Texas, respectively, following the relocation of four other billionaires ahead of the new year. Financial adviser David Lesperance told Bloomberg that he helped four billionaires leave the state ahead of the Jan. 1 residency cut-off date;\nIconiq Capital\nfounder Divesh Makan knows a handful of other families that have already departed and expects another 15 to 20 to flee if the tax is approved, Makan told Bloomberg.\nThe billionaire tax initiative still has a ways to go before making it to the\nNovember ballot\n. The effort must gather hundreds of thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, then secure approval from a majority of California voters. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those who have spoken out against the bill.\nTech founders from major companies like Netflix, WhatsApp and Stripe are\nreportedly also looking\nat homes in Florida to escape California, the New York Post reported. Last month, Google co-founder Larry Page\nbought roughly\n$173 million of waterfront real estate in Miami, including one $100 million estate and another one nearby for $72 million, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn the last probably month or so, I\u2019ve had multiple billionaires from California come to see several different listings that I have,\u201d Devin Kay, a Miami-based agent with Douglas Elliman, told the Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s definitely a huge wave of them, it appears they are either\nbuying properties in Miami\nor in the market to buy properties, and will once they find something here shortly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a huge influx from California ever since Covid,\u201d Kay added. \u201cIn the last three or four years, I\u2019ve seen more buyers from California than I ever have in my entire career. But I would say the megabillionaires or the very, very wealthy people from California \u2014 that is definitely more recent as of the last, maybe two or three months.\u201d\nSimply put, these ultra-wealthy buyers are looking to escape the possible ballot measure in California. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious why these guys are doing what they\u2019re doing in Miami,\u201d Kay said.\nBut billionaires aren\u2019t the only ones leaving California, and this trend isn\u2019t new among the average person.\nOf the more than 2.5 million one-way trips using\nU-Haul\nvehicles last year, the difference between number of people leaving and the number of people arriving\nwas higher in California\nthan in any other state, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing data from U-Haul. The Golden state has had the biggest net outflow for six years in a row. Of California U-Haulers, 50.6 percent of the moving company\u2019s one-way customers left, while 49.4 percent arrived.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They are the property of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group, which had put them into bankruptcy.\nWe\u2019ve heard the auction started Thursday morning and went into the night. But the winner was confirmed at 4 p.m. on Friday: Summit Properties, run by chairman Zohar Levy, is\nslated to be the new owner\nof the units.\nIt\u2019s a deal that\u2019s been much scrutinized. The city has raised concerns about the profitability of the minimum bid and sought to delay the auction. Tenants obviously consider Summit to be a slumlord. On Wednesday, reporting from Bisnow\nrevealed\nconnections between Summit and Wiener\u2019s brother Jonathan Wiener.\nBut beyond the back and forth about the sale price and Summit\u2019s stewardship, the pushback is, in my estimation, really about tenants and the Mamdani administration sensing an opportunity to take these units outside the purview of a traditional private landlord and into something\u2026 else.\nWhat that something else is, well, they haven\u2019t quite worked that out. The words \u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cpreservation\u201d and \u201ccommunity land trust\u201d have been bandied around. I\u2019ve written before about the\nvery real and bold dreams of alternative ownership\nfrom advocates and city officials. But so far there\u2019s no clear vision of what tenants and Mamdani want for these units.\nWhat is clear is that they have a limited time to get it. A delay would have given them time to think and plan, but that effort was\nthrown out by the bankruptcy judge\n. Summit now all but holds the keys. There\u2019s a hearing scheduled to confirm the auction result on January 15, giving the city just days to throw around its weight.\nIt\u2019s not looking so good right now for the city, but what could happen next is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have so many examples that sort of show us what\u2019s possible here,\u201d Ariel Hirsch of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board told me at the rally.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho is buying rent-stabilized buildings? Since the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 gutted the ability of landlords to raise those rents, it\u2019s been said that rent-stabilized buildings are worth next to nothing.

        "content": "Hyperion Group won increased incentives for its delayed Boynton Beach multifamily project in a deal presumed to be the local Community Redevelopment Agency\u2019s biggest-ever tax increment financing agreement.\nThis week, the\nBoynton Beach\nCRA approved a bump to $11.5 million from $9 million for the project that\u2019s expected to include 371 residential units, 25,600 square feet of retail space and a parking garage with 633 spaces, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe CRA also extended the term of the TIF agreement to 14 years from 12.\nThe eight-story project, called Ocean One, has been in the works since at least 2023, when the city\napproved the development.\nWinter Properties was part of the partnership at the time. Construction was expected to start in early 2024 and take two years.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Hyperion and New York-based Winter paid $12 million for the 3.7-acre development site at 114-222 North Federal Highway in 2021. Washington Real Estate Partners was the seller.\nThe increased subsidy is less than what Hyperion requested. The developer asked the CRA last year to raise the incentive to $16 million and stretch the deal to 15 years, citing a shifting economic landscape since the agreement was inked in May 2024.\nThe site is just north of Boynton Beach\u2019s downtown core. Arquitectonica is designing the development.\nCRAs can deploy taxpayer dollars to spur investment in redevelopment zones, often using TIF agreements to rebate a portion of future property tax revenue generated by developments.\nHyperion pointed to rising construction costs, persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, higher insurance premiums and uncertainty around tariffs, all of which it said had eroded the project\u2019s feasibility, in its request for additional subsidies.\nAn independent analysis commissioned by the CRA and conducted by Washington, D.C.-based Abramson &amp; Associates largely backed that assessment, finding Hyperion\u2019s revised cost projections \u201creasonable\u201d and concurring that broader economic conditions had worsened since the earlier agreement.\nCity officials previously described the $9 million incentive as the largest TIF package in the CRA\u2019s history.\nThe property sits within Boynton Beach\u2019s 2.6-square-mile redevelopment area, which has drawn interest as developers look for relatively cheap land between\nBoca Raton\nand\nWest Palm Beach\n.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Developer BGI Capital completed a $40.9 million acquisition of a development site adjacent to its nearly completed waterfront West Palm Beach condo tower, Alba Palm Beach.\nRecords show the Miami-based developer, led by Kenneth Baboun and Robert Barthelmess, bought the properties at 4720, 4802 and 4804 North Flagler Drive from Justo Naranjo, Beatriz Corrales, and Nataly Nicole Corrales for $33 million.\nThe purchase includes a waterfront single-family home and the 11 remaining units in the 4800 North Dixie condominium complex. That\u2019s in addition to the five units BGI bought for $7.9 million in 2023, according to property records.\nThe property is adjacent to BGI\u2019s\nAlba Palm Beach\n, a 22-story, 55-unit condominium set for completion this spring. Alba is 70 percent pre-sold, Baboun confirmed. BGI financed the purchase with a $25.6 million loan from a Linkvest Capital affiliate, according to property records.\nThe sites total 2.2 acres and 200 feet of waterfront, Baboun confirmed.\nThe developer is in the approval process for a second condo project tentatively dubbed Alba Reserve and slated for 31 stories and 87 units, according to city planning documents. BGI tapped Carlos Ott and Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners as the architects for the project. The tower will rise 360 feet, and units will be larger than in the adjacent Alba project, with square footage starting at 3,000 square feet, he confirmed. Baboun is also\nconsidering branding the project\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early to know what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in concept design, this is the exciting part.\u201d\nWhile the project is in early stages, Baboun made clear he is going for a luxe client with a bigger budget than his first West Palm Beach tower, where prices started at $2.5 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going high end all the way,\u201d he said, noting the strength of the market over $6 million.\nNaranjo is a local resident and real estate investor with a portfolio of properties throughout Palm Beach County, records show. He and his wife Beatriz Corrales bought the single-family home at 4720 North Flagler Drive for $1.7 million in 2014 and have it homesteaded.\nAfter the developer acquired the 1.7-acre Alba site for $5.8 million in 2020, Naranjo and his family members started acquiring units in the neighboring condo buildings, anticipating future developer interest. Records show they spent about $2 million buying the units.\nThe two planned towers are part of\na deep pipeline of condo projects\nin West Palm Beach that total more than 2,000 units. The rapid market growth has raised speculation about possible saturation, but Baboun said he sees \u201cdepth\u201d in the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conservative with our pipeline, we\u2019re in no hurry to launch projects as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that sales will not launch for this second tower for another year or two.\nBaboun said he sees a severe shortage of existing waterfront condos in the city.\nOther developers see it, too. Huizenga Holdings and Integra Investments are planning a $2 billion redevelopment of the waterfront around Rybovich Marina at 4200 North Flagler Drive that will include four towers with more than 660 residential units. Toronto-based Great Gulf is planning a 32-story, 97-unit tower at 5400 North Flagler Drive, a site it bought for\n$28.5 million\nin 2024.",

        "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom\nis taking aim at institutional investors making purchases in the residential market.\nFollowing a\nsimilar announcement by President Donald Trump\n, Newsom is\nplanning to work\nwith local legislators to prevent private equity and hedge fund investors and other corporate entities from purchasing homes in California, the Mercury News reported, citing communications with the governor\u2019s office.\n\u201cThe fact is that large investors are purchasing homes faster than families can buy them,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cThe governor believes that working families shouldn\u2019t be competing with large, well-capitalized investors.\u201d\nNewsom shared his approach in his State of the State address on Thursday.\n\u201cThere is another urgent area requiring our attention. That\u2019s institutional investors snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership, and forcing rents too damn high for everyone else. It\u2019s shameful that we allow private equity firms in Manhattan to become the biggest landlords in many of our cities,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, we will work with the Legislature to combat this monopolistic behavior, strengthen accountability, and level the playing field for working families. That means more oversight and enforcement, and potentially changing the state tax code to make this work,\u201d he said.\nAbout 3 percent of single-family homes in California are owned by large landlords; publicly traded\nInvitation Homes\nis the largest owner, according to a 2024 study by the California Research Bureau cited by the Mercury News. Large\ninstitutional landlords\nown less than 1 percent of total U.S. single-family housing inventory, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company analysts said in a statement this week, per the Mercury News.\nAfter Trump announced his intentions to take on institutional investors in residential real estate, stock share prices of single-family landlords fell by as much as 10 percent, according to the Mercury News. \u201cAt the risk of whistling past the graveyard, we could argue that the dip in the stocks presents a buying opportunity,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said in their report.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement is already being well received in the state legislature. Last year, the state assembly approved a bill that would ban large single-family residential property owners from buying and leasing more homes. The measure ended up stalling in the state Senate amid opposition from real estate agents and the California Apartment Association.\n\u201cHaving the governor\u2019s backing and support is going to be crucial and very helpful,\u201d Assemblymember Alex Lee, who authored that bill, said, vowing to pursue it again this year. Newsom has not endorsed a specific proposal.\nState Senator Scott Wiener also supports legislation targeting corporate landlords but shies away from policies that could choke housing production. \u201cThere\u2019s been a desire to do something about the gobbling up of single-family homes by institutional investors for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an issue that we need to deal with.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing the city\u2019s appetite for new housing in the South Loop, proposing a 19-story apartment building.\nA venture led by Vahooman Mirkhaef filed a zoning application to build a 237-unit residential building at 557\u2013571 West Polk Street. The proposal would replace a two-story office building that currently serves as the headquarters of Environmental Group Services, Mirkhaef\u2019s environmental consulting firm, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nDetails on construction costs and timing were not disclosed, but the plan would add to a\nsparse downtown\npipeline. Financing challenges over the past few years have sidelined many large projects, even as rents have rebounded sharply.\nJust three large-scale apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed downtown in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. That shortage has helped push rents up more than 8 percent, year over year, in the third quarter of 2025, the firm said.\nSome new building permits for apartments near the city\u2019s core are starting to take shape, however. Across the water in River North, a full building permit was issued last week for\nZSD\u2019s\nmixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot.\nMirkhaef\u2019s venture has owned the Polk Street property since 2003, according to the zoning filing. The original purchase price does not appear in Cook County property records. Mirkhaef did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe proposal includes 102 off-street parking spaces and would fall under Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nPlans\ncall for 12 affordable units to be built on site and another 12 elsewhere in the 28th Ward, with an in-lieu fee covering the remaining obligation.\nMirkhaef is also a controversial figure in local real estate and business circles. He previously operated Cub Terminal, a\nsuburban logistics depot\n, and in 2021 pleaded guilty to paying bribes to former state\nSen. Martin Sandoval\nto aid that business, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. In 2024, federal prosecutors declined to oppose his appeal to overturn the conviction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Rogers Park\u2019s most recognizable homes is heading to national television, and possibly a six-figure renovation.\nThe Candyland House, the pastel-drenched Victorian at 1525 West Pratt Boulevard in Chicago, is featured this season on HGTV\u2019s \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d giving the property a shot at a $150,000 makeover. The home appears in the show\u2019s seventh season, which premiered this week, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nOwners Joe Bergantino and Ricky Gonzalez said HGTV reached out in late 2024 about a potential appearance, without initially disclosing the show. When they learned the\nCandyland House\nwas being considered for \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d the couple took it in stride. Gonzalez told the outlet that they started laughing.\nThe show, hosted by comedian\nRetta\n, tours some of the country\u2019s most over-the-top fixer-uppers before selecting one for a full renovation led by \u201cSin City Rehab\u201d designer\nAlison Victoria\n. The winning home gets a fast-tracked overhaul that would otherwise take years for most owners to tackle.\nIn 2022. Bergantino and Gonzalez bought the house built in 1891 and have been slowly restoring it while documenting the process on Instagram. Longtime\nRogers Park\nresidents know the home for its candy-colored exterior and wildly imaginative interiors, a legacy of artists Jackie Seiden and the late Don Seiden, who coated nearly every surface in pastel hues, sometimes accented with glitter.\nWhen the Seiden family sold the house in 2021, neighbors worried the next owners might strip away its personality. Bergantino and Gonzalez promised to preserve the home\u2019s\neccentric spirit\n, and say that won\u2019t change even if HGTV selects it for the renovation.\n\u201cNo chance in hell would the renovation ever be black, white, gray or beige,\u201d Bergantino told the publication.\nFilming took place in June, with a 12-hour shoot expected to be edited down to a brief segment. The couple paused their own renovation work once they learned they\u2019d be featured, figuring an untouched interior might improve their odds of winning the makeover.\nWithout the\nHGTV\nboost, they estimate it would take roughly a decade to complete their plans. If selected, the transformation would take about six weeks \u2014 a dramatic shift in both timeline and cost.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project, deemed Sutro Cove, would rise on a site owned by longtime residents that live in two homes on nine lots, which firm founder Stanley Saitowitz said his team plans to subdivide into 20 units.\n\u201cThe property actually belongs to a family that grew up there,\u201d Saitowitz told SF Gate. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a few buildings around the city that present this\u2026 modern interpretation of the traditional texture of the city, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the design.\u201d\nThe buildings would feature floor-to-ceiling windows and inset balconies facing the Pacific Ocean. Units would feature repeating bay windows that Saitowitz said would create a \u201cwaving facade\u201d mimicking the ocean waves below. Residences at Sutro Cove would range from studios to four-bedroom units. Two of the apartments in the building would be set aside as deed-restricted\naffordable housing\nfor\nresidents making 80 percent\nof the area\u2019s median income \u2014 $87,300 for one person or $124,700 for a household of four. The firm has applied to use\nSenate Bill 423\n, which streamlines approval for affordable and mixed-income housing.\nThe development would also have garage parking for 18 vehicles and internal courtyards to help block winds coming off the ocean \u2014 a common architectural touch in many Sunset and\nRichmond District\nhomes.\nSaitowitz\u2019s firm has left its mark across San Francisco with notable projects such as the Beth Sholom Synagogue in the Inner Richmond. Sutro Cove\u2019s design is inspired by the recently completed \u201cHouse of Fog\u201d at 2117 46th Avenue in the\nSunset District\n, which Stanley Saitowitz | Natoma Architects designed. That two-unit property is centered around a central courtyard and served as \u201ca prototype for the thinking around these houses,\u201d Saitowitz said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Starwood is expected to file the foreclosure Friday, ending Todd Interests\u2019 run at the property.\nTodd\nsaid his firm owes roughly $230 million on the building and won\u2019t contest the action. The decision, he said, comes down to math that no longer works: elevated interest rates, soft downtown values and apartment occupancy that has slipped below 80 percent.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication, adding that negotiations with\nStarwood\nwere cordial. \u201cIn 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nDallas-based Todd Interests and partners poured about $460 million into transforming the long-vacant, 1.5 million-square-foot tower at 1401 Elm Street. Opened in 1965 and shuttered in 2010 as office demand collapsed, the building sat empty for a decade before becoming one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country and the biggest in\nDallas\nhistory.\nThe redevelopment converted the mid-century office monolith into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail, backed by heavy public incentives. Todd once billed the financing as the largest historic tax credit deal in\nTexas\n, anchored by roughly $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing.\nTodd told the outlet that more than $150 million has already been repaid to tax credit investors, including Stonehenge Capital and AHP, Warren Buffett\u2019s tax-credit arm. The project was refinanced with Starwood three years ago, a deal that allowed Todd and major investor Moriah Real Estate to recoup about 90 percent of their investment. Much of that capital was plowed back into the building in hopes a rebound would follow.\nIt didn\u2019t. \u201cThe values aren\u2019t there,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe loan is due, and we\u2019re not going to continue to pay.\u201d\nThe foreclosure comes shortly after Todd Interests sold its stake in the nearby East Quarter redevelopment to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "With the Compass and Anywhere Real Estate\u2019s mega-merger closed months ahead of schedule, the residential industry is now in the wait-and-see phase for the ripple effects from the seismic deal.\nThe earliest symptom so far is New York City\u2019s publicists, agents and executives tapping the acquisition as a hook to explain their next moves.\nEarlier this week, the companies announced that the proposed acquisition, valued at $1.6 billion, had\ncleared the waiting period\nfor antitrust regulatory review and would likely close by Friday, even though the firms initially said the deal likely wouldn\u2019t be finalized until late 2026. Stockholders\nvoted to approve\nthe merger on Wednesday.\nThe next morning, an email from a publicist landed in my inbox, flagging the split of one of Compass\u2019 top teams in Bergen County, New Jersey, a move she billed as \u201cparticular notable given the timing of the $1.6 billion merger\u201d and her client, Max Stokes\u2019, status as a founding member of the brokerage\u2019s Ridgewood outpost.\n\u201cIf I was going to make a move, this would be the perfect time to do it,\u201d said Stokes, who isn\u2019t leaving Compass, but breaking from his partner Megan Fox to launch his own \u201csmall and mighty\u201d team. He called the merger an \u201cinflection point\u201d and said Compass growing bigger was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d even as he aims to shrink his operation.\nStill, some have cited the acquisition among the reasons for their departures from Compass. On Wednesday, just before news of the deal closing broke, a New York City and Westchester agent sent an email announcing her move to Brown Harris Stevens, and in it, she wrote that \u201cthe acquisition of Anywhere Brand along with the\nZillow Lawsuit\nnews took attention and resources away from agents.\u201d\nCompass and Anywhere announced their agreement to merge in September, sending shockwaves through the industry, still reeling from Compass\u2019 earlier\n$444 million acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.\nThe proposed deal stipulated that Compass CEO Robert Reffkin would lead the merged companies and that brands would continue to operate independently. On Friday, Reffkin and executives with Anywhere\u2019s subsidiaries, including the Corcoran Group CEO Pam Liebman, presented a united front, posting a graphic with all of the brands\u2019 logos with the tagline \u201cBetter Together\u201d on social media.\nThe news raised questions about how the well-known names would operate under one roof and whether agents in Anywhere\u2019s network would remain with their firms under the Compass umbrella. Since then, many independent brokerages, especially in New York City, have\ntouted the deal\nas a boon for their businesses.\n\u201cBigger isn\u2019t always better,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman told\nThe Real Deal\nin September. \u201cNot everyone wants a big company.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s too soon to tell whether that pitch will pan out. In November, Zillow\npublished a report\nshowing that about half of Anywhere agents surveyed by the platform said they would consider leaving if the acquisition made it across the finish line.\nHowever, on further inspection, the results weren\u2019t particularly revelatory \u2014 they included responses from just 122 brokers in Anywhere\u2019s 300,000-agent network, according to a Zillow spokesperson, who also said he didn\u2019t have the breakdown of which firms the agents responding belonged to.\nThe data we do have shows the ebb and flow of top producers among legacy firms is alive and well. including one of Douglas Elliman\u2019s leading Brooklyn brokers, Lindsay Barton Barrett, who on Tuesday\nbrought her team\nto the brokerage. Last month, Heather Domi, a New York City and South Florida agent and co-founder of the New York Residential Agent Continuum,\nleft Compass\nto join Elliman.\nNot so fast\u2026\nNew York City\u2019s new development market logged a\nlackluster year\nin 2025.\nBuyers signed contracts for 2,750 new development properties across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, down 11 percent from the total in 2024, Marketproof data shows. The firm\u2019s CEO Kael Goodman chalked the dip up to inventory, especially in Manhattan and Brooklyn, failing to keep pace with demand \u2014 an issue several new development players\nexpect to continue\nplaguing the market in 2026.\nLast year, Manhattan nabbed 1,400 inked deals last year, marking a 12 percent annual decrease, while inventory in the borough fell 13 percent year-over-year. In Brooklyn, contract signings dropped 6 percent to roughly 1,000, while inventory declined 19 percent.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for a townhouse at 22 East 78th Street, which closed for roughly $10.5 million. The five-story home, which sold to an anonymous LLC with an address in Washington D.C., last traded in 2015 for $12.6 million.\nThe townhouse spans 5,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a terrace, landscaped garden, chef\u2019s kitchen and five fireplaces.\nCompass\u2019 Oliver Han had the listing.\n",

        "content": "To start the year, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green is straddling two very different realities in Manhattan\u2019s office market. The contrast is hard to miss.\nOn one side is\n100 Park Avenue\n, where the real estate investment trust looks firmly in control. Selling a minority stake in the building to Rockpoint at a $425 million valuation gave SL Green a clean, early win as it kicks off a planned $2.5 billion selloff.\nThe move came just weeks after the firm bought out Prudential\u2019s 49 percent stake at a $360 million valuation, put in fresh equity and quickly turned around and sold an interest at a higher mark.\nThat kind of sequencing sends a message: this isn\u2019t a fire sale. The 900,000-square-foot tower is 95 percent leased, buoyed by Alvarez &amp; Marsal\u2019s 220,000-square-foot deal, and sits just south of Grand Central; it\u2019s exactly the kind of asset that\u2019s still drawing capital.\nBy selling partial interests instead of whole buildings, SL Green is freeing up cash to deal with high interest rates while keeping a hand on the wheel. Management has framed the selloff as balance-sheet management, not a pullback, and has already said it plans to be back buying this year.\nAcross Midtown, though, the tone is much more combative. At Worldwide Plaza, SL Green and RXR are fighting in court to\nblock a UCC foreclosure\nthey say is designed to wrest control of the property rather than recover mezzanine debt. The lawsuit against Extell Development paints the auction as rushed, restrictive and tilted to scare off real bidders.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes fight over who gets leverage in restructuring nearly $1 billion of CMBS debt.\nThe backdrop is ugly. Worldwide Plaza is only about 63 percent occupied, lost Cravath as its anchor tenant and was appraised at $345 million last year, down sharply from its pre-pandemic peak.\nTogether, the properties show SL Green playing both sides of the cycle: cashing in where demand and liquidity still exist and digging in where the path forward depends less on leasing wins and more on control, timing and the courts.\nThere\u2019s been no shortage of New York real estate headlines in the early days of 2026. Here\u2019s some of the week\u2019s other big stories.\nJudge rejects Mamdani\u2019s bid to pause Pinnacle auction, paves way for Summit takeover\nIn the first big test of Zohran Mamdani\u2019s real estate policy plans, a bankruptcy judge rejected the city\u2019s bid to pause the auction of over 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments. The decision allows Summit Properties to proceed with a possible takeover of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group portfolio, though results of Thursday\u2019s auction still weren\u2019t public by the time of this writing.\n\u201cBroken promises\u201d and unpaid bills: Law firm representing Chetrit seeks to withdraw from case\nAttorney Elliott Joffe accused the Chetrits of non-cooperation, providing unreliable info and unpaid legal bills and is seeking to withdraw from representing Meyer Chetrit. The developer is battling a $132 million judgement owed to an entity of Maverick Real Estate Partners after a foreclosure case, as well as criminal charges of tenant harassment.\nJudge awards $22M to JLL over Moshe Silber\u2019s mortgage fraud\nMoshe Silber and his business partner, Fred Schulman, were ordered to pay $21.7 million in restitution to their lender, JLL. The pair pleaded guilty more than a year ago to a\nmortgage fraud scheme\nin which they obtained an inflated loan for a 976-unit rental property in Cincinnati.\nHousing whirlwind: Mamdani wastes no time targeting \u201cbad landlords\u201d\nMamdani began his term targeting \u201cbad landlords,\u201d including naming tenant advocate Cea Weaver as director of the relaunched Office to Protect Tenants. The city is also hosting \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings for tenants to voice grievances and help shape future policy\n",

        "content": "So many crazy things are happening in real estate and politics. President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a striking admission about rent-stabilized buildings. And Cea Weaver, tenant activist and newly appointed Mamdani official, is apologizing for her long-held beliefs.\nLet\u2019s start with Mamdani. His legal brief on the\nPinnacle portfolio bankruptcy\nasserted that even at the mere $88,000 per unit offered by Summit Properties USA, the price would be too high.\nThis is the same man who claimed throughout his campaign that owners of rent-stabilized housing were profiting handsomely. Now Mamdani is now declaring that rent-stabilized housing has been rendered\nvirtually worthless\n.\nHe\u2019s also saying it\nshould\nbe nearly worthless so that owners cannot borrow against it, freeing up money for operating expenses and repairs rather than mortgage payments.\nCommenters on social media pounced. Some said the city\u2019s legal filing should be presented to the Supreme Court as evidence that rent stabilization is\na taking\nof private property \u2014 and thus unconstitutional.\nSummit\u2019s offer is actually higher than other rent-stabilized portfolios are asking. One industry PR veteran told me he can\u2019t wrap his brain around the fact that in New York City it costs $800,000 to build an affordable unit but\nonly $69,000\nto buy one.\n\u201cThe delta between the cost and value of the affordable units is striking,\u201d he emailed. \u201cI\u2019m no economist, but when a commodity is worth 1/10th of what it costs to produce, I think there is a problem.\u201d\nAlso striking: Tenant activist Weaver was forced to say her past tweets that private property should be seized and that homeownership is a tool of white supremacy were \u201c\nregretful\n\u201d and \u201cnot something I would say today.\u201d\nWeaver, 37, has been consistent in\nthese opinions\nfor years. Suddenly she finds them regretful? What she really regrets is having to walk them back. Swallowing your pride is the price of being inside City Hall rather than protesting on its steps.\nMaking Weaver apologize is another sign that Mamdani is\nmoving away from radicalism\nin order to govern. Meanwhile in Washington, Trump\u2019s aides seem to do the opposite \u2014 abandoning\nmainstream opinions\nthey\nonce held\nin favor of provocative statements to please the boss and the base.\nSpeaking of Trump, you know we\u2019re in strange times when he and Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. And not good ideas, either.\nTrump on Wednesday\ncalled for a ban\non institutional investors\u2019 buying single-family homes, something\nHochul did last year\n\u2014 with cowardly state legislators joining in.\nMy\ncolumn\nabout Hochul\u2019s proposal had a very subtle headline: \u201cWhy Hochul\u2019s crackdown on real estate investors makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\nInstitutional investors are a small fraction of the market and don\u2019t get into bidding wars for homes. They rent houses to people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to own. They own\nless than 1 percent\nof single-family homes and\n3 or 4 percent\nof single-family rentals. They account for\n0.5 percent\nto\n2 percent\nof single-family purchases. For\nsix consecutive quarters\nthey have sold more homes than they\u2019ve bought.\nTrump\u2019s bomb-drop on homebuying came just six days after Hochul proposed \u201c\nno tax on tips\n,\u201d matching a Trump campaign proposal that Congress put into the Big Beautiful Bill.\nOne is a real estate policy and the other is about taxes, but they are similar in that they aim to fool voters, not to be effective policy.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d sounds progressive because tipped workers are not high earners. But it applies to just 2 percent of workers. What about the other 98 percent? Why do restaurants\u2019 servers but not kitchen staff deserve a tax break?\nAbout 37 percent of tipped workers don\u2019t even make enough money to pay federal income taxes, so Trump\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t save them anything. But their tips are still subject to payroll taxes.\nHochul\u2019s tips proposal seems like a preemptive move to ensure that her Republican challenger, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, cannot adopt it for his own campaign.\nIf the first week of 2026 is any indication, it\u2019s going to be a wild year.\n",

        "content": "This year has started off with bad news for Chicago commercial real estate, as a battle over botched lab space deals is underway.\nChicago-based\nPortal Innovations filed suit against Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners\n, a major office landlord accused of failing to meet funding commitments tied to several of Portal\u2019s shared lab space ventures, including sites in Fulton Market, Houston, Boston and Atlanta.\nThe dispute centers on missed capital calls that Portal says could leave it unable to meet obligations on leases it signed with Beacon\u2019s financial backing.\nBeacon\npushed back, saying the outstanding capital call was less than $1 million and that it has already sunk tens of millions into Portal-backed buildouts.\nTheir drama drags the life sciences real estate mess squarely into Chicago \u2014 a market that, until now, had largely sidestepped the turmoil hammering San Diego, Boston and the Bay Area.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Portal. The company\u2019s model of flexible, fully built lab space for early-stage biotech startups draws comparisons to\nWeWork\u2019s\nill-fated coworking empire. Shared lab space is a capital-intensive business, especially when tenants can\u2019t scale. Chicago already saw one version collapse when\nBioLabs was evicted\nfrom a Sterling Bay-owned Lincoln Park property last year. That 125,000-square-foot property is about to be sold to\nDallas-based Altera Fund Advisors\n, likely at a substantial discount from Sterling\u2019s $64 million mortgage debt. The buyer plans to convert it from lab-oriented into outpatient medical offices.\nMeanwhile, national cracks in the sector continue to spread. In San Diego,\nBank OZK this week sold off a $265 million loan note\non a life sciences project also built by Chicago-based Sterling Bay to Strategic Value Partners. But that\u2019s only part of OZK\u2019s exposure to San Diego\u2019s struggling new development market for labs.\nThe bank also holds a $915 million loan on a 1.6 million-square-foot waterfront life sciences and office campus built by\nIQHQ\n\u2014 a six-block life sciences and office project that remains largely vacant. By the estimate of\nRebel Cole\n, a finance professor who has been outspoken about the risk within Bank OZK\u2019s loan book, the project could be worth as little as $500 million, nearly half the debt balance, depending on market rent assumptions and lease-up prospects.\nOf course, the\nsole building Sterling Bay completed\nat its famously stalled megadevelopment\nLincoln Yards\n, a 285,000-square-foot lab structure, is also still fully vacant and served as a warning the life sciences slowdown would hit Chicago. Bank OZK also extended more than $50 million in debt for Sterling Bay to build that project, and it\u2019s now being shopped with pricing expectations to come in below the loan balance.\nIt\u2019s a stark\nreversal from 2021\n, when life sciences was the darling of institutional investors. More than $10 billion poured into the sector that year as investors chased lab space insulated from the pandemic\u2019s office headwinds.\nTaconic Partners\n, for one, plowed $2 billion into New York projects aiming to corner the sector. Now, the firm\u2019s plans are largely frozen.\nThe latest life sciences report by CBRE painted a sluggish picture: the sector\u2019s vacancy rose to more than 23 percent across the U.S., though the 0.8 percent increase marked the smallest since late 2022. There\u2019s little clarity on when absorption will return.\nOnce thought immune to remote work trends, life sciences real estate is proving just as vulnerable to overbuilding, interest rates and shifting capital flows as any other asset class. Now, Chicago is experiencing the fallout.\n",

        "content": "The safest kind of bet is one you already know the outcome of. It\u2019s the perfect kind of bet for a guy on the sidelines, like, for example, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.\nOn the same day telecoms giant\nAT&amp;T dropped its bomb\non Downtown Dallas via news of its plans to relocate to Plano, Johnson was\ntalking to\nthe New York Post about Zohran Mamdani\u2019s inauguration.\n\u201cWhat was already a trickle is going to turn into a flood of individuals and companies who have called New York home for a long time, moving to Dallas,\u201d he told the outlet.\nThat\u2019s some impressive reading of the tea leaves. One wonders what gave him the idea. Maybe the half-built campuses for the world\u2019s biggest banks rising in his backyard clued him in.\nIt\u2019s 2026. We\u2019re about 15 years into the rise of North Texas as a corporate relo destination \u2014 so many years into the trend that\nit\u2019s started dwindling\n.\nMeanwhile,\nthe urban core\nof the city that elected Johnson was dealt a catastrophic blow on Monday. AT&amp;T announced plans to build a new campus in Plano, leaving a 2 million-square-foot hole in Downtown Dallas\u2019 already struggling office market as soon as late 2028. Before the announcement, vacancy rates in the urban core were averaging 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nGov. Greg Abbott didn\u2019t name Johnson, but seemed to take aim at the mayor when discussing who should shoulder the blame for the catastrophic move: \u201cLocal leaders, it\u2019s their responsibility to ensure that homeless people are not endangering their citizens,\u201d Abbott\nsaid\nat a campaign event in Fort Worth.\nThe same day, the future of Neiman Marcus\u2019 downtown flagship store got murkier.\nSaks Global CEO Marc Metrick stepped down\nas rumors swirled about a potential upcoming bankruptcy filing.\nIn early 2025, Saks announced plans to close the landmark store at 1618 Main Street, then repeatedly delayed the move after pushback from city leaders, stating it would remain open beyond the 2025 holiday season as talks continued with the city on a potential reimagining of the nine-story historic property.\nA third grenade hit Downtown Dallas last week when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News he\u2019s handing back the keys to The National, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refi loan in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in TK.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been committed to downtown,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been committed for 20 years. In 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nThe smartest syndicator in the room\nThe world of real estate syndication has a reputation. Operators are seen as unsophisticated and inexperienced, treating real estate investment like social media influencing.\nJon Venetos seemed different\n. The Lurin Capital founder came up in prestigious hedge funds before pivoting to real estate, but he ended up meeting the same fate as his peers in the space. Since the spring of 2025, he\u2019s faced a crush of default lawsuits, foreclosures and receivership appointments; he\u2019s also fighting allegations of fraud from lenders and former employees.\nNew year, same distress\nWhen it seems like there\u2019s nothing left for\nTides Equities\nto lose, the embattled syndicator gets hit with another foreclosure notice. This time, the firm owned by Sean Kia and Ryan Andrade could lose Tides at Highland Meadows, a 650-unit apartment complex at 11330 Amanda Lane in Dallas. The $76.4 million loan tied to the property is a chunk of the\n$826 million in troubled CRE debt\nthat were flagged for foreclosure auction this month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The number represents a dip from\nDecember\u2019s high of $911 million\nin debt headed to auction, but it\u2019s still far above prior months when the value of debt flagged for foreclosure hovered around $600 million.\nRiver Oaks dominates in Houston\u2019s top luxury deals\nOf the\n10 most expensive homes\nsold in Harris County in 2025, five were within one square mile of each other in Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood. The gates estate at 2110 River Oaks Boulevard topped the list. It\u2019s one of the 31 River Oaks homes designed by legendary architect John Staub between 1924 and 1958. It was last listed for $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agent Laura Sweeney represented the buyer and seller.\nGoogle turns on at Austin\u2019s Sail Tower\nAt long last,\nGoogle has moved\ninto Austin\u2019s 35-story, 804,000-square-foot Sail Tower after signing a full-building lease at the building in 2019. The tower, at 601 West Second Street in Downtown Austin, had been conspicuously vacant since its completion in 2022, a situation estimated to have cost Google about $53 million annually in rent. Despite having a full-building lease, Google is marketing the top six floors for sublease, with Digital Realty Trust identified as a potential subtenant.",

        "content": "Housing isn\u2019t the only marquee issue for San Franciscans, but it does lead a litany of challenges that includes an office vacancy rate above 30 percent despite gains from the still blossoming artificial intelligence industry, slow construction permitting and the general vibe of an increasingly pugnacious Trump administration.\nAll of that, and more, arose on Wednesday, as the three major candidates vying to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi as San Francisco\u2019s voice in Washington D.C. gathered before a packed auditorium and tried to convince voters of their vision for the city.\nStill, when asked for the most pressing issue, state Sen. Scott Wiener,\nthe race\u2019s most high-profile candidate\n, immediately pointed to housing. Indeed, over the course of the evening, Wiener, San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who formerly worked as chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, laid out their competing proposals to address the city\u2019s housing shortage\nLittle wonder in San Francisco, a city\nmandated to permit 82,000 new housing units by 2031\n.\nCould the feds help?\n\u201cThe federal government used to play a huge role in housing in this country,\u201d said Wiener, who, since arriving at the legislature in 2017, has authored some of the most ambitious housing bills in California\u2019s history. \u201cWe need massive investment in affordable housing, in social housing, mixed-income social housing in this country.\u201d\nWiener called for providing incentives for cities to more rapidly permit construction so as to keep federal grants and loans from getting bogged down in bureaucracy. He also said he would prioritize modernizing the construction industry, and stabilizing the local skilled workforce.\nChakrabarti said the city\u2019s efforts to rezone neighborhoods and speed up permitting, while good on paper, has failed to actually produce housing. He talked about bringing back the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a New Deal agency from the 1930s that provided low-interest loans to developers and stockpiled steel and lumber to insulate the effect of inflation on critical construction materials. Chakrabarti also said he wanted to repeal the Faircloth Amendment, part of the 1998 federal bill that restricts new social housing construction.\nChan, a progressive\nwho many see as a foil to Wiener\u2019s build-build-build and upzone ethos\n, agreed that the city needs to build more housing but argued it was already happening. She said the city needed land and money in order to deliver \u201ctrue, real housing,\u201d and not just luxury condos for the wealthy.\n\u201cOne of the best ways to actually solve homelessness is to make sure that people can actually stay housed, and that means to preserve the existing housing that we have today, including rent controlled units,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most affordable and most valuable housing that we have in our city, and we must preserve them.\u201d\nA day after the candidate\u2019s forum, the San Francisco Chronicle reported what many in the city had been expecting:\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s so-called Family Zoning Plan\n, passed late last year by the city\u2019s board of supervisors, would face a legal challenge. The plan, which upzoned parts of the city that haven\u2019t added additional housing stock in decades, was set to go into effect Monday, but may be paused due to the litigation. The lawsuit, filed by San Francisco Neighborhoods United and Small Business Forward, attempts to compel the city to further study the plan\u2019s impact on city infrastructure, historic resources, and at-risk communities before it goes into effect.\nWhile Lurie\u2019s housing solution faces a snag, one of the city\u2019s most embattled development sites may finally get unlocked. The Oceanwide Center, a two-tower proposal that broke ground in 2021 and was supposed to produce the city\u2019s second tallest skyscraper behind the Salesforce Tower, has sat abandoned for years. Now, the project\u2019s China-based lender, Haitong International Equity Investment Management, has taken control of the property and expects to put it to auction on January 15. The San Francisco Business Times is reporting that the San Francisco Recovery Fund \u2014 a new venture from long-time local developer Dan Kingsley and his business partner, Jay Yang \u2014 is\npoised to purchase the property for $100 million\n. The fund put down a\nnonrefundable deposit on the property in December.\nYang declined\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment, saying only that his fund was in the process of closing on the purchase.\n",

        "content": "One year later and people are mad as hell.\nOpen up a news story from this past Wednesday, the one-year anniversary of the Palisades and Eaton fires, and the answer to what, precisely, they\u2019re made about is muddled.\nBloomberg\nasked its newsletter subscribers \u201cWhat\u2019s holding LA back?\u201d before trying to peg a decline in property values to climate change and a cooling of investor sentiment, along with $33.9 billion in federal disaster aid being held hostage as possible answers. The\nNew York Post\n,\u00a0 true to form, characterized the Palisades as a \u201cwasteland.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal\nstruck a balance calling the recovery \u201cslow and uneven,\u201d driven by factors such as wealth and red tape reduction.\nThe lookbacks on everything from the handling of the fires\u2019 containments to insurance and rebuilding costs have flowed freely. It was solutions and calls for accountability that were sought at a hard-hitting demonstration under the banner of \u201cThey Let Us Burn,\u201d held on the January 7 anniversary of the infernos. The rally shut down Antioch Street and Swarthmore Avenue in the Palisades, with a crowd of several hundred gathered on the streets, some standing on top of the CVS building to listen for next steps. For some, that involves litigation. For others, it\u2019s calling for policy reform. Still others \u2014 more specifically former reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who announced his bid for mayor at the protest \u2014 want to shake up Los Angeles City Hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, while not a speaker at the rally, was in attendance, reflecting an interest in the circumstances of multiple clients still dealing with the aftermath of the fires and \u201ceffectively frozen\u201d from moving forward. She pointed to long-term problems that have been building well before last year\u2019s wildfires, including permit fees, Measure United to House L.A. (ULA), construction costs and delays. Atlas Maize said policy makers should stop looking at those items in isolation and instead see their points of connection to figure out a way forward.\n\u201cWe cannot keep rebuilding communities without reforming how insurance, permitting and infrastructure planning work together,\u201d she told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cHomeowners need guidance, predictability and protection \u2014 not just during the rebuild, but permanently. If we don\u2019t fix that, this will repeat itself again and again.\u201d\nResi brokerage change afoot?\nSpeaking of the need for change, that\u2019s exactly what former Compass California president Mark McLaughlin told\nsubscribers\nin a Friday newsletter weighing in on the\nCompass-Anywhere deal\nclosing.\nThe deal included $1.6 billion in stock and Compass buying Anywhere\u2019s $2.6 billion in debt for a combined value of $4.2 billion. The headcount of the merged entity is some 340,000 agents.\nMcLaughlin\u2019s served as Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020. He bounced back to the firm in 2023 as chief real estate strategist. After that two-year contract ended, the executive moved to a\npart-time mergers and acquisitions advisory role\nat the brokerage.\nMcLaughlin suggested to his followers the Compass-Anywhere combination has the leverage to reframe who serves who in the ecosystem of MLSs and agents. From McLaughlin\u2019s view, the short answer is portals need to \u201clisten and, in turn, shape a compelling offering\u201d for their customers.\n\u201cOur industry has been too tolerant of demands, constrictive rules and, in some instances, fines,\u201d McLaughlin said in his newsletter.\nTime will tell if a power shift is realized.\nCorona del Mar movement\nChange is also happening in coastal Orange County.\nThe Agency poached\nJohn Stanaland and his six-person team\nfrom Douglas Elliman, while also bringing on Craig Knizek as managing director in its Corona del Mar office.\nThe Agency co-founder Mauricio Umansky called Orange County a \u201ccornerstone market\u201d for the brokerage and said the latest additions are aimed at \u201clong-term impact\u201d regionally.\nThe office additions bring its headcount to 55 \u2014 a sizable operation that backs what Umansky\u2019s saying in a market that not all L.A.-based firms have broken into for various reasons.\nEven still, some Los Angeles brokerages have made their plays into the coastal enclave. That includes Douglas Elliman\u2019s Altman Brothers Team and the Oppenheim Group. Both have offices in Corona del Mar. Carolwood Estates entered Newport Beach through what is now a former affiliation with the Caruso Group (no relation to developer Rick Caruso).\nRemembering Sandra Miller\nMany have been spending recent weeks in remembrance of\nSandra Miller\n, the founder of Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Santa Monica.\nThe brokerage confirmed this past week Miller\u2019s passing during the holidays.\nOne word that has been repeatedly used by her colleagues to describe Miller: powerhouse.\nShe was the first California licensee to bring the German-based brokerage to the state and was also heavily involved in the industry. She had a seat on the California Association of Realtors Board of Directors and also held several leadership positions with the National Association of Realtors and Greater Los Angeles Association of Realtors.\nMiller\u2019s legacy in Santa Monica and beyond will continue with the office now being helmed by her son Steven Walter and brokerage manager Raymond Dominguez.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty has made another move to reshape its portfolio, shedding another not-so-occupied property as the company faces a wave of\nlease expirations\n.\nThe deal for the Sunset Media Center looks like a discount for joint venture Hankey Investment Company \u2014 owned by billionaire Don Hankey, who put up President Donald Trump\u2019s $175 million bond in his New York civil fraud case \u2014 and\nBarker Pacific Group.\nThe new owners paid $61 million for the 22-story, 326,000 square foot office, which comes to about $187 a square foot, with a Measure ULA tax bill of $3.6 million, according to property records. Located at 6255 West Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood \u2014 about two blocks from the Walk of Fame \u2014 the property is 51 percent occupied.\nHankey funded the debt for the purchase but amount was not disclosed; per the deed of trust, it is a $42 million note.\nKilroy\u2019s Los Angeles portfolio encompassed 53 properties, more than 4.5 million square feet of rentable space, and was 74 percent occupied, as of the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025. In Los Angeles, 42 leases that amount to 507,000 square feet, or about 4 percent of its leased space, are set to expire this year.\nKilroy sold a Santa Monica office building that was only 65 percent occupied last July. Then the real estate investment trust purchased Maple Plaza, a Beverly Hills office campus that was 75 percent leased at the time and marked the company\u2019s entry to the wealthy enclave \u2014 and may have given chief executive Angela Aman one of her better earnings call talking points since she took the corner office. Maple Plaza, she said on a third-quarter earnings call, had \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio.\u201d\nThe latest sale took Kilroy back to trimming inventory \u2014 and time will tell which way the REIT will lean on deals in 2026.\nCalendar item\nSpeaking of 2026 \u2026 Happy New Year! You know what that means? Earnings season, annual reports and proxies. Time to see how Los Angeles\u2019 publicly traded commercial real estate companies fared, and how much they\npaid\ntheir executives. Stay tuned.\nGood news out of the Valley\nIn Oct. 2025,\nThe Real Deal\nwrote\nthe Encino Financial Center, a 13-story office building owned by Lowe Enterprises, received an appraisal that reduced its value by almost a third. That was after its loan landed in special servicing due to imminent monetary default. The nearly 230,000-square-foot office building at 16133 Ventura Boulevard is still valued at about $49 million compared to $72 million at loan issuance in February 2015, which is more than the $39 million debt connected to the property.\nBut a loan modification was closed, and the note was extended to Nov. 2026, according to Morningstar, which buys Lowe more time. The borrower funded $2.5 million in new capital as part of the modification terms, per Morningstar. And, the three largest tenants, all of which had lease expirations next year, have extended their leases.\nEl Segundo trade\nDowntown Los Angeles offices are still bumping along bottom, and even discounted deals are commanding pricier amounts on a per square foot basis in submarkets beyond the city\u2019s center.\u00a0 Take Majestic Asset Management and AVG Partners\u2019 recent El Segundo\nbuy\n. The three-story office building traded hands for $121.5 million, or about $405 a square foot.\nThat is less than the $170 million, or about $560 per square foot, Ocean West Capital Partners and Lionstone Investments purchased the real estate at 777 South Aviation Boulevard for pre-pandemic. But it is more per square foot, than the priciest office\ntrade\nlast year: Uncommon Developers\u2019 purchase of a Brookfield-owned downtown skyscraper for $210 million, or $201 a square foot.\nEl Segundo\u2019s office sector is nowhere near as distressed as downtown\u2019s, but isn\u2019t as\nprosperous\nas Century City\u2019s either.\nBlackstone checks out\nBlackstone\nditched\nan extended-stay, Marriott-branded hotel in Torrance, near Redondo Beach, for about $54 million, or roughly $218,000 per key. The buyer of the Residence Inn at 3701 Torrance Boulevard is Capital Insight.\nOn a per room basis, in Los Angeles County, it isn\u2019t as distressed as it could be, but still reflects an ongoing hospitality rut. It\u2019s more than lender Corten Real Estate Partners\u2019\npurchase\n, via auction, of the Line in Koreatown for $68 million, or $177,000 a room \u2014 but less than Pebblebrook Hotel Trust\u2019s sale of the Montrose in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million, or about $333,000 a room.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a new year, but in Surfside, the arguments sound familiar.\nA recently proposed Live Local Act project is stirring local opposition, even as state lawmakers look to double-down on the pro-development workforce housing law that has\nriled up residents\nand local governments across the state.\nA pair of developers submitted plans in November for an 11-story, 33-unit residential and hotel project on 95th Street in Surfside. An affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, filed the application.\nThe building would replace a single-story pink post office that was built in the 1950s.\nSurfside Mayor Charles Burkett called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Burkett went further. He said it\u2019s outrageous that Florida politicians have \u201cdecided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns\u201d via the Live Local Act.\nLive Local became law in 2023. It encourages the development of workforce housing, limited to tenants earning a maximum of 120 percent of the area median income, by giving developers density, height, parking and tax incentives, among other things.\nThe law has stripped cities of their approval power. If developers comply with the requirements of the law, they can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe law has also riled up a number of towns and their residents.\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, opponents of the project cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its development fate.\nTown staff members are reviewing the application.\nLawmakers in Tallahassee will likely be unphased, as they have been in years past, by calls to return power to municipalities or help control overdevelopment.\nAmong the real estate bills that could be considered this legislative session is Senate Bill 1548, which was filed late last week by Sen. Alexis Calatayud. The bill expands the properties that qualify for Live Local to include any property owned by a county, municipality or school district. In those cases, the property owner would have to be a party to the application and those projects must be within the geographical boundaries of their respective county, municipality or school district.\nCounties would also be barred from restricting height of Live Local Act projects through other means \u2014 i.e. setbacks or stepbacks.\nThe bill has some other quirks. Farms and farm operations are not considered commercial or industrial properties.\nKeep an eye for our additional reporting on this and other real estate-related bills the legislature could take up this session, which starts on Monday.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDo you expect more of a crackdown on Venezuelan investment in South Florida following Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture and arrest, or the opposite? Are your Venezuelan clients listing their U.S. properties for sale? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nThe mansion at 1460 North Lake Way in Palm Beach changed hands for $72 million. British investor\nPamela W. Starret\nsold the nearly 1-acre property to a hidden buyer. The roughly 16,000-square-foot house has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half baths.\nCommercial\n: In Coral Gables, DWS Group sold\nthe Alhambra\n, a two-building office complex at 2 Alhambra Plaza and 95 Merrick Way for $119.6 million. Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA waterfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $105 million\n. The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom compound sits on an acre at 790 South County Road. It\u2019s on the market with Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate. The Maurice Fatio-designed Mediterranean home spans more than 17,000 square feet, including outdoor space, and it includes a carriage house, four-car garage, library, gym, dining room that sits 30 people, a pool and dock. Property records show it sold for about\n$31 million in 2021\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nBillionaire and Google co-founder Larry Page is the mystery buyer who purchased two waterfront properties in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for a combined $173 million. Fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin also made an offer to buy a waterfront home on Allison Island in Miami Beach for about $50 million \u2014\nrecord deals\nthat represent the tiniest fraction of their combined net worths.\nElsewhere in\nFlorida\nMiami\nThe Miami Hurricanes will be\nplaying for the championship\nafter beating Ole Miss at the Fiesta Bowl last week.

        "content": "Jack McGinley knew he was going to lose the lawsuit over his Gold Coast Chicago mansion.\nThat\u2019s according to texts sent by his broker, as the former pharmaceutical executive and his wife, Julie McGinley, faced a lawsuit over their decision to back out of a $7.4 million deal to sell their home, days before it was set to close in May. The McGinleys reached a settlement in December with the buyers, Jason and Courtney Kuhn, who took them to court last year to enforce the sale. The terms of the agreement are not public in court records.\nIn texts surfaced in court filings, the McGinleys\u2019 broker, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s\nTim Salm\n, said Jack McGinley knew that he would eventually lose the lawsuit, but the litigation would give him time to stay there.\n\u201cJack said the litigators said it will take 2-3 years for them to win, and he\u2019s 78 and will give him that time to live in the house which is worth it,\u201d Salm wrote in a text message to the lawyer who worked with the McGinleys on the sale.\nIn another text, Salm said the buyers will \u201cwin the lawsuit and ultimately get the house. He knows it.\u201d Salm did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit centered on the botched deal over the 9,000-square-foot home at 1336 North State Parkway, which fell apart after Julie McGinley grew more and more uncertain with the decision to sell the house, according to deposition testimony from the McGinleys.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the McGinleys were accused of treating contracts as optional. The Harold B. Smith Foundation is suing the McGinleys for canceling a $37.5 million offer to buy\nAloha Lodge\nin Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\nAccording to that lawsuit, the McGinleys canceled a pending contract to buy a Palm Beach, Florida home from the same foundation just a few days before the agreed-upon closing date in 2023. In a separate incident with different sellers, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint, the McGinleys pulled out of a contract to buy a Lake Geneva home before closing. The couple entered into a contract to buy the same property two years later, then terminated it again, prompting a Wisconsin lawsuit in 2020, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation said in the filing the McGinleys have a \u201cpattern of signing binding contracts and then not closing the transactions.\u201d\nBeyond the\nGold Coast\nhome,\nthe McGinleys\nown houses in Lake Forest; Santa Ynez, California, and South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, according to court documents.\nThe McGinleys, Courtney Kuhn, and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nSince the terms of the settlement are private, it\u2019s not clear if the McGinleys ended up handing over the Gold Coast property to the Kuhns. No property record showing the transfer of the property is available. However, in September, when the suit was ongoing, a record was filed indicating the McGinleys paid off a $6 million mortgage they had taken out on the house in 2020.\nThe signature\nDuring negotiations over the Gold Coast house, the McGinleys\u2019 lawyer, Julie Moltz-Matgous, requested an extension to the original contract that allowed the McGinleys to pull out of the deal by May 21. The original contract, signed March 22, had a 14-day window for either party to cancel. In response, the Kuhns requested that the change allow either party to cancel the contract by the new date.\nMoltz-Matgous sent a subsequent letter denying that request and withdrawing the request to change the contract. But on May 21, after the deadline to cancel the contract, Moltz-Matgous sent a letter to the Kuhns\u2019 attorney notifying them that the closing, which was scheduled for June 2, was canceled.\nTo back up their legal right to cancel the contract, the McGinleys argued in court that Jack McGinley, who signed the contract, was not authorized to make decisions for JJR Holdings, the LLC that owned the home. The sole member of JJR Holdings is JCM Trust, and the McGinleys argued Julie McGinley was the only beneficiary of that trust.\nBut the plaintiffs produced a 2013 document in discovery that lists Jack McGinley as a trustee of JCM Trust. The McGinleys argued that joint ownership was only temporary, and the trust was transferred back to Julie McGinley later. In a court filing, the McGinleys\u2019 attorneys pointed to Secretary of State records that show Julie McGinley is the \u201csole member\u201d of JCM Trust.\nThe plaintiffs argued that Jack McGinley had previously signed documents for JJR Holdings, and even if he technically lacked authority to sign, the contract was still valid because Julie McGinley agreed through her conduct. They noted that she allowed inspections to occur, permitted her attorney to negotiate contract modifications and accepted the earnest money deposit without objection, thereby validating the contract after the fact.\nSeller\u2019s remorse\nThe McGinleys\u2019 deposition testimony paints Jack McGinley as the hard-driving dealmaker and Julie McGinley as a reluctant participant who had never fully agreed to the sale.\nJack McGinley said when the Kuhns\u2019 offer came in, Julie McGinley wasn\u2019t happy with the offer. Jack McGinley said he told his wife \u201cwe can always get out\u201d and pushed her to move forward with the deal, according to court documents.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve done with every property we own, I coerced, I pushed,\u201d Jack McGinley said. \u201cI usually get my way, so I drove hard to get this deal done.\u201d\nJulie McGinley said she was never on board, and wanted to sell the house for a higher price. The McGinleys paid $7.1 million for the house in 2013, property records show, and she said in her testimony they had made close to $4 million in renovations. But she said she never told her broker or attorney that she objected to his signature on the contract, according to court documents.\n\u201cI won\u2019t say I went along with it. I disagreed with it vehemently,\u201d she said in deposition testimony. \u201dI just knew the deal wasn\u2019t done, and I was trying to convince him we\u2019re getting out of this.\u201d\nJack McGinley said in the deposition he told Moltz-Matgous to cancel the contract after a conversation with his wife where she refused to sell the house.\n\u201cShe was the most upset I\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought up until that point I could convince her to sell the property.\u201d\n",

        "content": "As Chicago\u2019s industrial sector stabilizes following a\npandemic-era boom of activity\n, data centers are propping up the market, year-end data from Savills shows.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of 2025, less than 10 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills\u2019 report. But during the fourth quarter, that number began to tick up again and landed at 13 million square feet, driven mostly by incoming data center developments.\nThose numbers are still far below the construction activity seen during the peak of the pandemic. In the last quarter of 2022, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills.\nAs work-from-home policies caused office demand to plummet, industrial development became a safe haven for investors. Chicago is particularly well-suited to such projects because of its\nextensive rail network and access to freshwater\n.\nStill, that level of activity has tapered off in recent years since the pandemic.\nIndustrial asking rents rose 2.1 percent in 2025, year-over-year, to $7.94 per square foot, but with concessions factored in, net effective rent stayed roughly the same compared to 2024 in much of the Chicago area.\nNet absorption improved significantly last year, indicating that the region\u2019s supply is doing a better job matching demand from tenants. By the end of 2024, about 400,000 more square feet of space was leased than vacated. In the last quarter of 2025, that figure jumped up to 7.3 million square feet.\nBuyers are still interested in the market too. The highest dollar sale in Cook County last year was\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s purchase of a $270 million industrial portfolio\nin the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\na TRD data analysis found\n. The seller was Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics.\nIt was the only sale that came in over $200 million last year.",

The firms will control 113-121 Prince Street for 25 years in exchange for a little over $50 million, according to city records. The lease also gives the option to extend to 2091.\nIt\u2019s the latest retail deal in Soho, where asking rents have picked up. The neighborhood is now the most expensive retail corridor south of Times Square, according to a\n2025 report\nfrom the Real Estate Board of New York.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no availability in Soho right now and there\u2019s still a ton of tenants who want to be there,\u201d said Jeffrey Kohn, founder of Hilltop.\nAsking rents on Broadway between Houston and Broome are still significantly less than they were at their peak in 2015. But at a median of $604 per square foot, they\u2019ve basically doubled from their pandemic lows in 2021. Asking rents on that strip rose more than 26 percent between 2024 and 2025, according to REBNY. (The storefronts on Prince Street are about two blocks west of Broadway.)\nThat\u2019s not the same for every neighborhood. Herald Square, for instance, has not seen the same level of retailer interest. Median asking rents on West 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues are only $447 per square foot.\nSoho has stood out in part for its visuals, Kohn said. Last year, apparel brand Ralph Lauren paid $132 million to buy its retail condo next door to the new acquisition, at 109 Prince Street.\nThe storefronts at 113-121 Prince are currently leased to clothiers Ba&amp;sh, Sandro and Farm Rio. The units comprise about 8,250 square feet on the ground floor and 7,000 square feet of basement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic and historically designated location for over 50 years and we think it will stand the test of time for the next 50 plus,\u201d said Todd Rich, cofounder and head of real estate at Declaration Partners.\nThe lessor was an affiliate of Soho Development Corp and Rocco Buonpane signed the memorandum of lease for the company.

The firm paid $36 million for the 290,000-square-foot, 147-unit rental home community built in 2024, according to the release. The deal works out to about $245,000 per unit.\nNate Hyman, founder of Polaris, arranged financing for the deal, a $25.2 million loan from New York-based Encore Finance Group, loan documents show.\n\u201cThis went very [smoothly] and had a closing period of under 60 days because of Polaris\u2019 relationship with the lender and the understanding we have for the BTR space,\u201d Hyman said in an email.\nHyman also arranged the financing for Four Corners\u2019 $55.2 million purchase of two built-to-rent communities in Slidell, Louisiana, totaling 248 units. The trade worked out to $222,400 per unit.\nThe Oaks at Grand West Apartments features three- and four-bedroom rental homes that range in size from 1,800 square feet to 2,000 square feet, each with laundry facilities, a two-car garage, covered patio and fenced-in backyard, according to the property\u2019s website. Shared amenities include a dog park and playground. Rents at the property start at about $2,400 per month.\nBuilt-to-rent properties, which offer some of the same perks as a single-family home, soared in popularity during the pandemic when remote work and lockdowns kept people confined to their homes.\nThese rental properties also offer an alternative to vertical living for would-be homebuyers kept on the sidelines by the highly competitive seller\u2019s market of 2020 and 2021 and then the high interest rates that have plagued the market since 2022.\nThe trend has really taken off in Texas, where nearly 22,000 built-to-rent units were in the pipeline in the beginning of 2025 \u2014 the most of any state in the country, according to a report from Point2Homes. At the city level, Phoenix led the nation,\nfollowed by Dallas\n, Atlanta and Charlotte. Houston ranked fifth, with 4,613 units under construction at the beginning of last year.\n",

The 10-year lease was quietly put together before the end of last year.\nFinancial details of the lease were not disclosed. PayPal is expected to occupy three floors of the building when it moves in next year, though it\u2019s unclear what will happen to its space at 95 Morton Street.\nThe building is owned by a joint venture of Hines, Trinity Church Wall Street and Norges Bank Investment Management. Other tenants at the building include Audacy, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Hines and Fanatics, which signed a lease for\n54,000 square feet last year\n.\nThe 17-story, 980,000-square-foot property at 345 Hudson is facing a delicate moment. While boasting a prominent tenant roster, Google is in the process of trying to\nsublease 165,000 square feet\nas it consolidates around St. John\u2019s Terminal. A year after that effort began, there\u2019s been no indication of Google finding a taker for the space.\nMore than 400,000 square feet was available at 345 Hudson Street prior to the Fanatics deal, according to CBRE marketing materials. The average asking rent in Hudson Square and the Meatpacking District in the first quarter was $99.13 per square foot, according to\nNewmark\n, a big jump year-over-year; the availability rate was 21.3 percent, one of the highest rates of any neighborhood in Manhattan.\nManhattan\noffice leasing\nreached pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, posting its strongest quarter since late 2019. That fed into a yearly total of nearly 42 million square feet, the highest for a year since 2019.\nIncreased demand resulted in tightening market conditions. The availability rate fell to 13.9 percent and the average asking rent climbed to $76 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate fixer Mark Nussbaum is in a big mess and things don\u2019t seem to be getting much better.\nNussbaum acted as an attorney, a bridge lender, a deal connector and even a landlord, all while running his law firm Nussbaum Lowinger.\nNow he\u2019s staring down a $400 million hole with former clients alleging he misappropriated escrow funds. He\u2019s also facing criminal charges from Manhattan\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s office for allegedly stealing at least $15 million from escrow clients. (Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty). One lawsuit accuses Nussbaum Lowinger of running a\nPonzi scheme\nwith much of the money going to a now deceased Borough Park investor named Mendel Steiner.\nIn the past month, new court filings have revealed some of the most explosive information to date about the breadth of Nussbaum\u2019s influence in tri-state real estate, who he did business with and the difficulties that lie ahead for creditors trying to collect from Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nWhat\u2019s Next For Nussbaum?\nThe Manhattan D.A.\u2019s criminal charges against Nussbaum are pending. At the time of the indictment in May, prosecutors mentioned only two victims, but noted that they believed there were more.\nNussbaum is out on bail. He has had two hearing dates, but both matters were adjourned. His next hearing is scheduled for March.\nThe case will rest on whether Nussbaum\u2019s former clients knew of his schemes. Nussbaum\u2019s legal team will likely argue the victims were aware that their escrow money was at risk or were clued in to Nussbaum\u2019s\n\u201cshow capital\u201d tactic\n, where Nussbaum would allegedly wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender that capital was secured. Were these victims, or investors?\nThe Debtors\nNussbaum filed an\nexhaustive list\nof all his creditors and debtors in December. He had over $400 million in creditors. But the more notable names were on the debtor side.\nThey included:\nSteiner, who had the largest debt at $306 million.\nBoruch Drillman, a Brooklyn investor who pleaded guilty for his role in a mortgage fraud conspiracy in 2023, owed $4.7 million.\nYanky Tauber\n, Nussbaum\u2019s deal partner on Chicago real estate, owes $1.5 million.\nOpal Holdings head\nShaya Prager\n, owed $1.1 million.\nIn civil court, Nussbaum and his former law firms Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates entered into an alternative to bankruptcy, known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. He appointed a lawyer, Sheldon Eisenberger, to handle the process. The goal is to attempt to pay the people Nussbaum owes money to.\nThe process has been a slog. Eisenberger has noted the poor state of books and records kept by Nussbaum. So far, debtors who owe Nussbaum money have been reluctant to return it, except for one person.\nThe Wolf\nThe mercurial Wolf Wercberger is the only one to reach a settlement with Eisenberger.\nWercberger recently agreed to pay about $15.3 million to resolve the ABC\u2019s claims against him. According to the settlement agreement, Wercberger deposited funds in Nussbaum\u2019s escrow accounts starting in 2022. Wercberger made back all the money he put into the funds plus $16 million to $19 million in extra proceeds.\nEisenberger agreed to Wercberger\u2019s payment, citing the poor state of Nussbaum\u2019s books and records and Nussbaum\u2019s lack of credibility if the matter were to be litigated in court, according court filings as part of the ABC.\nEisenberger says that Wercberger made the payment in part to encourage others to make payments to help the ABC pay \u201cinnocent parties\u201d who had likely lost money with Nussbaum. This includes people who used Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow services to buy family residences.\n\u201cThe settlement will infuse the estate with needed capital to pay out certain categories of creditors immediately and make it more likely all creditors receive distributions,\u201d Eisenberger said in a court filing.\nIt remains unclear why Wercberger would care about helping other creditors getting paid back.\nThere is another possible motivation: The settlement, if approved by the court, could stop future claims brought by Nussbaum creditors against Wercberger.\nWercberger has been a\nprominent figure\nin the Nussbaum saga and has been sued before by another Nussbaum creditor. Jacob Sod, a nursing home executive who was the first to file a lawsuit against Nussbaum, also filed a lawsuit against Wercberger claiming Nussbaum gave $15 million of his money to Wercberger as\n\u201chush money\n\u201d to prevent Wercberger from going to federal authorities.\nWercberger denied the claims and said Sod\u2019s attorneys were \u201crunning all over town, intimidating all of my business contacts and associates.\u201d In June, a Kings County judge dismissed Sod\u2019s claims, but Sod\u2019s lawyers are appealing the ruling.\nNussbaum\u2019s alleged tactics\nNussbaum Lowinger\u2019s clients largely came from Orthodox jewish communities in\nLakewood\n, New Jersey, Brooklyn and Monsey, New York. Nussbaum allegedly offered certain clients a lucrative opportunity. If they sent over funds into his firm\u2019s escrow accounts he would pay a return.\nOne of Nussbaum\u2019s alleged means of producing those high returns was through a novel move called \u201c\nshow capital.\n\u201d Nussbaum would wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender they had enough capital to close on a transaction. The money would appear in the accounts for a short-time, just long enough for a lender to agree to the deal, according to lawsuits and court documents.\nEssentially, Nussbaum\u2019s \u201cshow capital\u201d move allowed a real estate dealmaker to obtain a loan with no equity. Nussbaum would collect a fee along the way.\nBut at some point Nussbaum ran into a deficit and he could not pay back his clients in full. One client, nursing home executive Sod, filed a lawsuit in January demanding Nussbaum return $15 million in escrow funds. That lawsuit triggered more Nussbaum Lowinger clients to file their own suits, claiming that Nussbaum would not return their escrow money.\nQuestions were raised about where the money went.\nAt least $300 million went to a 33-year old Borough Park investor Mendel Steiner, according to Nussbaum\u2019s court filings. One lawsuit alleges Nussbaum transferred the money to Steiner who was supposed to buy properties. But Steiner never bought the properties and instead used fictitious names and contracts in an attempt to prove that money was going to legitimate deals, the lawsuit alleges.\nSteiner died by suicide in January 2025. Days later Nussbaum Lowinger\nshut down\nhis law firm.\n",

        "content": "Amli Residential is shaking up its C-suite for the first time in its 45-year history, handing the CEO reins to a new generation.\nThe Chicago-based multifamily owner and developer promoted Fred Schreiber to CEO from his prior role as executive vice president and chief operating officer,\naccording\nto CoStar. Taylor Bowen, previously president of Amli Development, will now serve as CEO of that affiliate, overseeing the firm\u2019s ground-up pipeline.\nLongtime Chairman and CEO\nGregory Mutz\nis not exiting the stage entirely. He\u2019ll remain chairman, while former Amli President Philip Tague steps into the vice chairman role. The moves formalize a succession plan that has been quietly underway for several years and keeps the company\u2019s founding leadership closely involved, Mutz said in an email to the outlet, adding that Schreiber and Bowen have steadily taken on more responsibility during the transition.\nAfter months of stagnation, U.S. multifamily rents ticked up slightly in December, snapping five straight months of flat or negative growth, according to data from CoStar-owned Apartments.com. While the bump is modest, it\u2019s a welcome signal for large operators navigating higher interest rates, tighter capital markets and a wave of new supply in several Sun Belt metros.\nAmli, founded in 1980 by Mutz and fellow attorney John Allen, has lived through multiple cycles. The firm went public in 1994 as Amli Residential Properties Trust, before Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing paid $2.1 billion to take it private in 2006. Today, the company remains a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and controls roughly 26,000 apartments nationwide, with an estimated value of $12.5 billion, according to Mutz.\nThe firm has continued to transact and plan new development. In one recent deal, Amli paid $134 million for the 275-unit\nMilieu tower\nin Chicago\u2019s West Loop. It\u2019s also pursuing a 56-story,\n498-unit apartment tower\nat 669 North Michigan Avenue, a high-profile proposal along the Magnificent Mile.\nSchreiber will remain based at Amli\u2019s Chicago headquarters, while Bowen operates out of\nDallas\n. The company employs nearly 900 people, with major offices in Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The home was owned by legal entities that did not include her. When they parted ways, Tony bought a $19.5 million condominium a few miles away, and Jeanne learned via Tony\u2019s attorneys that she\nwasn\u2019t entitled\nto live in the house because she is not associated with the trust that owns it, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.\nThe home first\nwent up for sale\nin October 2024 for $195 million. The price fell by $20 million the following April.\nEven with today\u2019s listing price being approximately 69 percent of what the billionaire originally sought for the property, if it sold for $135 million it would still surpass the country\u2019s\npriciest home sale of 2025\n, a $133 million property in Naples, Florida, according to Redfin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time [for the owners] to\nmove to the next chapter\n,\u201d listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency told Mansion Global. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to pass the torch.\u201d\nAt 50,000 square feet, the home is one of the largest in the U.S., rivaling the 55,000-square-foot\nWhite House\n.

Indian Trails alone brought in over $2 million in HUD payments.\nFor years, they have come under fire from tenants who have dealt with unsafe conditions and broken promises of repairs.\nCourt records show the property built in 1971 has faced repeated violations in recent years, including failing heat and hot water, electrical issues, nonfunctioning fire safety equipment and plumbing failures. Tenants describe flooded basements, sewage leaks, rodent infestations and maintenance requests allegedly ignored for months.\nAll major systems and units will receive upgrades under the new ownership, according to the release.",

Walker &amp; Dunlop provided the $116 million, five-year, fixed-rate Fannie Mae loan.\nThe seven-story apartment complex opened roughly 10 months ago. It sits on a four-acre parcel and is approximately three miles from the New York City border.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Jonathan Schwartz and Keith Kurland arranged the debt for the property, which also includes 44 affordable housing units. Neither of the landlords responded to requests for comment from the publication.\nRose, Amy Rose\u2019s company that specializes in the luxury multifamily sector, recently revealed that it would\nhelp facilitate\nthe conversion of a 48-story tower at 30 Broad Street in New York City\u2019s Financial District, a 571-unit project led by InterVest Capital Partners.\nGetting further outside the city, Lincoln Equities Group refinanced a recently completed industrial property in the Hudson Valley with $106 million in debt, according to the\nObserver\n.\nAffiliates of Apollo and CenterSquare Investment Management came forward with the bridge loan for Building B at Interstate Crossings in Brewster. The debt contains a future funding component that ownership will be able to pull from while leasing and stabilizing the asset, which sits at the intersection of Interstate 84 and Interstate 684.\nLincoln delivered the 618,000-square-foot warehouse last year, a potentially advantageous facility considering its accessibility to several major markets, including the New York City metro area, New England and the mid-Atlantic corridor. Minimal industrial supply is coming online in the Westchester-Putnam County market, according to JLL, due to a lack of available land for the sector.\nJLL\u2019s Peter Rotchford and Christopher Pratt negotiated the Brewster debt deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Business First reported. The seller was Rancho Cucamonga-based real estate developer IHC State LLC.\nDaum Commercial Real Estate Services\nfacilitated the sale. Agents Eric Fikse and Eric Burney represented the seller and Fikse also procured the buyer. IHC State was \u201cseeking a buyer that could assume the existing debt, despite a lockout provision and prepayment hurdles,\u201d Fikse said in a statement, per L.A. Business First.\nThe building at 875 West State Street is fully occupied and features 51 dock-high doors, two grade-level doors and 2,000 amps of power. The property is located approximately an hour away from Los Angeles International Airport and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nThe Inland Empire industrial market has\nbeen on shaky ground\namid a slow post-pandemic recovery. In the third quarter of 2025, the Inland Empire West industrial submarket had a nearly 7.7 percent overall vacancy rate, per Daum\ndata\ncited by L.A. Business First. By contrast, the Greater Los Angeles industrial market had a 5 percent vacancy rate in the same period, according to CBRE\u2019s third-quarter report.

The Upper East Side condo hit the market in May, asking just under $11.75 million. The seller bought it from the late radio host and political commentator\nRush Limbaugh\nfor just under $12 million in 2010.\nThe 4,700-square-foot apartment spans the entire 20th floor and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features four terraces and views of Central Park.

        "content": "CC Homes, led by developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr, cashed out of their Sunrise development site planned for 900 homes for $164.5 million, a big gain in value from its price three years ago.\nNew York-based DW Partners, a land bank for homebuilding titan Lennar, bought the 160-acre former golf course at 7400 Northwest 24th Place from Coral Gables-based CC Homes and its partner Ronald DiGasbarro, according to records. DW Partners and Lennar signed a purchase option agreement for Lennar to purchase the site. The agreement expires in 2031.\nCC Homes also is entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds from each future home sale, records show.\nThe project, called Solterra, is planned for about 400 single-family homes and the remainder of the residences will be townhomes, including affordable townhomes. It\u2019s been in the works since at least 2021, when CC Homes\nscored\na development agreement with the city, including to form the Solterra Community Development District.\nCDDs\nare a common way for developers of large communities in Florida to finance roads, stormwater and sewer systems, sidewalks and other infrastructure. Once residential complexes are sold out, homeowners assume the responsibility to pay back the CDD bonds.\nCC Homes and DiGasbarro paid\n$12.3 million\nfor the site, which used to be the Sunrise Country Club.\nCodina and Carr founded residential development firm CC Homes in 2007. Separately, Codina and his daughter, Ana-Marie Codina Barlick, lead development firm Coral Gables-based Codina Partners.\nMiami-based Lennar, led by Stuart Miller, is considered the second largest homebuilder in the U.S. and the largest in\nsouth Miami-Dade County\n. It heavily relies on land banks to hold developable tracts until Lennar is ready to start building homes. This way, Lennar\noutsources\nland ownership and the risk tied to it, allowing it to carry the land off its financial books and deploy its funds toward construction instead of land ownership.\nNear Pompano Beach, Millrose Properties of Florida, which Lennar spun off as its land bank last year, paid\n$50 million\nlast month for a 20-acre development site planned for 426 condos and townhomes within The Pomp mixed-use project.\nAlso last month, DW Partners paid\n$24 million\nfor 423 homesites in the Keys Gate residential subdivision in Homestead. The seller, JEN Partners, also is a land bank for Lennar, with the homebuilder essentially switching land banks through the deal.\n",

        "content": "Another building in Dallas\u2019 Harwood District secured a major refinancing in December, as the rocky office market continues to recover.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Harwood International refinanced Harwood No. 14, the newest and tallest tower in the district, with a $160.8 million loan, according to Dallas County records first\nreported\nby The Dallas Morning News. New York Life Insurance provided the financing on Dec. 18, with the deal recorded Dec. 23. A separate Harwood-affiliated entity owns the property.\nCompleted in June 2023, the 26-story\noffice tower\nat 2801 North Harwood Street marked a design-forward expansion for the district. The 360,000-square-foot office tower was designed by Japan\u2019s Kengo Kuma &amp; Associates, with Dallas-based Corgan as architect of record. In addition to office space, the building includes restaurant space and a 17,000-square-foot rooftop and sky garden.\nThe refinancing lands amid a turbulent stretch for Harwood International. Over the past year, the developer sold four office towers to private equity giant TPG, unloading Harwood buildings No. 2, 6, 7 and 10 between early September and early October 2025. The four properties total roughly 900,000 square feet.\nIn November, law firm Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15 at 3008 North Harwood,\npulled out\nof the project, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nEarlier in 2025, Harwood also sold Harwood No. 4 to Spear Street Capital after defaulting on a loan, with the San Francisco firm planning multimillion-dollar upgrades.\nThe seven-story Harwood No. 1, the district\u2019s original office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, reverted to lender First United Bank after a\nforeclosure auction\nin November, part of a series of at least four foreclosure threats faced by the developer, as Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm also took on a\n$100 million loan\nat the end of last year.\nThat same Harwood No. 1 has now found a new owner. Dallas-based Cawley Partners purchased the nearly 106,000-square-foot building from First United Trust following the foreclosure, with a $29.5 million acquisition loan, according to deed records. The sale price was not disclosed. First United Bank\u2019s winning foreclosure bid was $27.2 million, while the Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $25 million.\nCawley plans to invest $10 million to modernize the building, built in 1984, updating common areas and adding 50,000 square feet of spec suites. The property is about 50 percent leased.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vanderbilt University is moving forward with its plans for a graduate campus in West Palm Beach, more than a year after scoring its first approvals for the project.\nThe Nashville-based university is\npreparing to break ground on the $520 million campus\n, which will offer graduate programs in business and technology, according to a press release. It is the culmination of a years-long effort by both\nVanderbilt\nand West Palm Beach real estate heavyweights to bring the \u201cHarvard of the South\u201d to the aspiring Wall Street South. Billionaire Related Ross chairman\nSteve Ross\ncommitted $50 million to the campus in April. He\u2019s also hosted fundraisers on behalf of the school and advocated publicly for the project.\n\u201cTo pass up this opportunity would be a crime,\u201d he said at a county meeting in 2024. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that\u2019s ever grown that doesn\u2019t have great universities, great schools.\u201d\nRoss has millions of square feet of office and residential towers in the pipeline in West Palm Beach, and he\u2019s been on a mission to woo major institutions and corporations to fill them.\nCleveland Clinic\nis set to anchor his planned 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center, and he donated $50 million to for an additional 150-bed hospital Cleveland Clinic is planning at 400 and 450 South Australian Avenue, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported.\nAmong the other real estate donors for Vanderbilt\u2019s planned campus are billionaire Jeff Greene and\nFrisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell\n, an alum who committed $5 million.\nVanderbilt launched its fundraising campaign for the West Palm Beach campus last year, with a goal of $300 million. The university did not confirm the total it raised in today\u2019s announcement, but disclosed it would be launching a second phase aimed at raising $250 million.\nPalm Beach County and West Palm Beach City officials\nvoted in 2024\nto gift the university 7 acres of publicly owned land for the campus. In the same vote, county commissioners approved a development and conveyance agreement (DCA) with Vanderbilt that requires the university to spend $300 million in capital expenditures and create 4,500 construction jobs with the project. Vanderbilt must also have 200 full-time employees, 1,000 total students and a $70 million annual operating budget within five years of beginning operations.\nWest Palm Beach won\u2019t be the first satellite graduate campus for the university. It opened in New York City last year at a former Episcopal seminary in Chelsea at 440 West 21st Street.",

The move comes as Urban Outfitters\u2019 lease expires, roughly a decade after the retailer made a then-bold leap north from its former Rush Street site into a pocket better known for steakhouses than soft goods.\nThe vacancy sets up a real-time stress test for top-tier urban retail, which has\noutperformed\nthe broader market since the pandemic upended shopping corridors in early 2020, according to CoStar. While stretches of the Magnificent Mile continue to work through elevated vacancy and repositioning, the Gold Coast has largely thrived, buoyed by\ndense wealth\n, tourism and a restaurant scene that never fully lost its luster.\nUrban Outfitters occupied space on the ground and lower levels of the three-story building, which it shares with Maple &amp; Ash, one of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country. The steakhouse controls part of the ground floor and the entire third floor, anchoring the property with consistent foot traffic day and night.\nCBRE is seeking a new tenant for Urban\u2019s former space, with leasing options ranging from roughly 5,000 square feet to 19,007 square feet, including the vacant second floor. The property is owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and is being marketed by CBRE brokers Danny Jacobson, Stephen Ansani and Luke Molloy. The marketing brochure from CBRE does not list any asking price.\nUrban Outfitters did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet. It\u2019s unclear whether the brand could return to the\nGold Coast\nin another format. The company still operates Chicago-area stores on North Milwaukee Avenue and at Westfield Old Orchard and Oakbrook Center. Nationally, Urban Outfitters has been experimenting with new store concepts and resale-focused\nReclectic\nstores.\nJacobson told the outlet that interest is already building, with early conversations spanning apparel, food and beverage, furniture and home d\u00e9cor. Some prospects would be new to Chicago.\nThe building sits in the\nViagra Triangle\n, a nickname locals use for the affluent wedge formed by State and Rush streets and Bellevue Place. New retail is also coming online at the base of Newberry Tower Plaza, and Convexity Properties is planning apartments on the former Barnes &amp; Noble site nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A 1970s-era office building in the heart of\nDowntown Austin\nis up for grabs.\nHouston-based Highland Resources placed 211 Seventh on the market, according to a release from JLL Capital Markets managing director Jeff Coddington. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the brokerage team, which includes Coddington, Joe Dowdle and Ryan Stevens, is marketing the 12-story building at 211 East Seventh Street.\nBuilt on roughly 0.7 acres, the 162,000-square-foot office building sits across the street from the historic Driskill Hotel and the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. It\u2019s also adjacent to Stream Realty Partners\u2019 ongoing remake of East Sixth Street, part of a broader effort to turn the once-raucous\n\u201cDirty Sixth\u201d\ncorridor into a more polished, all-day destination with restaurants and daytime foot traffic.\nJLL is pitching flexibility. A buyer could hold the building as offices, redevelop the site or pursue adaptive reuse, converting the structure to residential or hospitality. The asking price was not disclosed in JLL\u2019s marketing brochure, but the property was most recently appraised at $23.8 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nThe optionality of the building comes against a challenging office backdrop. Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate stood at 25.8 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. Still, Stevens told the outlet that some investors are positioning ahead of a projected rebound.\n\u201cWe expect the Austin\noffice capital markets\nto remain fertile ground for opportunistic, contrarian buyers positioning ahead of a 2026/2027 leasing rebound,\u201d Stevens said in an emailed statement to the publication, pointing to historically low basis levels despite elevated vacancy.\nAbout 62,000 square feet of the building at 211 Seventh is currently being marketed for lease. Based on tenant listings and signage, the building is roughly 61 percent leased, with occupants including Dealerware, ThinkOnward, Brightpearl by Sage and Suvida Healthcare. Those tenants are largely on short-term leases, Coddington said.\nThe site also carries density upside. While\nAustin\nrecently imposed a temporary 350-foot height cap downtown, developers can exceed it by participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program. According to the publication, the parcel is eligible for a floor-to-area ratio of up to 25-to-1 and sits outside\nCapitol View Corridors\n, removing another common constraint.\nThe adaptive reuse angle could also attract interested parties, as only about 1.1 percent of Austin\u2019s office inventory is considered viable for conversion, according to research from Partners. JLL\u2019s Coddington insisted the building at 211 Seventh is an exception, citing its relatively small floor plates of about 16,700 square feet and high window-to-floor ratio, features that can make residential or hotel conversions more feasible.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Italian investor and entrepreneur Gianluca Vacchi filed a lawsuit against his partner, developer Michael Stern, over his investment in a North Beach development that has not come to fruition.\nVacchi accused Stern and two companies tied to him of a \u201cdeliberated and calculated fraud\u201d in a scathing complaint filed in December, court records show. The lawsuit was temporarily stayed \u2014 in other words paused \u2014 earlier this month, but the complaint remains active.\nVacchi\u2019s GV NBV sued Stern, 6345 JV LLC and 6345 Manager LLC over a $2.5 million investment in the Casablanca property, an oceanfront condo-hotel at 6345 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach.\nThe two\npartnered in 2024\n, forming a joint venture to invest in a $4 billion pipeline of new developments.\nVacchi joined Stern on\nMercedes-Benz Places Miami\n, the Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded 888 Brickell and the 1250 West Avenue project in Miami Beach. But construction at Mercedes-Benz has moved slowly. At 1250 West Avenue, developer David Martin of Miami-based Terra joined Stern\nto take the lead\non the project last year.\nVacchi also partnered with Stern, Anatomy Fitness owner Chris Paciello and Rafi Gibly on Sunset Padel, an indoor padel members\u2019 only club that operates in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour.\nVacchi is part of the wealthy Vacchi family based in Italy. He sold his stake in their IMA Group, a manufacturing empire, in 2023.\nReuters\nreported that year that the private equity firm BC Partners agreed to sell its stake in IMA to BDT &amp; MSD Partners in a deal valuing the company at about 7 billion euros. A year ago, Vacchi was sued by a project consultant based in Naples, Florida, over allegedly\nunpaid fees tied to evaluations\nof the Stern-Vacchi developments.\nVacchi\u2019s attorney, Jason Giller, declined to comment on the lawsuit involving Stern. Stern also declined to comment.\n\u201cSystematic\u201d fraud\nVacchi alleges that Stern\u2019s actions were evidence of \u201cyet another scam conjured up by Stern.\u201d\nVacchi alleges that Stern schemed him into investing $2 million into a planned redevelopment of the Casablanca, in May or June of 2024, through \u201cbrazen misrepresentations, fabricated or improperly modified documents, and concealment of material facts,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe first $2 million investment was promised as a \u201cquick flip\u201d and a \u201cno lose\u201d proposition, according to the lawsuit.\nStern provided Vacchi\u2019s entity with what Stern allegedly claimed was a third-party valuation on the Casablanca land \u2014 valuing the site between $210 million and $276 million. Vacchi\u2019s company would become a member of Stern\u2019s LLC as part of the agreement. Vacchi pulled the trigger on the additional half a million dollars the following year. The valuation was actually created by JDS\u2019 development director, the lawsuit alleges.\nStern allegedly represented that it would cost $150 million to buy out Casablanca, according to the lawsuit, which would have allowed for a big windfall had he purchased and then flipped the property at the valuation price.\nStern has refused to give Vacchi a membership certificate that shows his investment in 6345 JV LLC. Instead, Stern claims that GV Development Group, not GV NBV LLC, invested in the Stern entity. That dilutes his stake in the project and his overall investment to nearly $2.2 million, the complaint alleges.\nIt\u2019s unknown how Stern and Vacchi will move forward, especially if the lawsuit continues. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Vacchi\u2019s investments are being bought out by an institutional investor.\nVacchi\u2019s lawsuit cites information from JDSPulse.com, a website that\nStern sued\nthe anonymous operator of last year over allegedly defamatory statements. That complaint, filed last year, claims the unknown website owner orchestrated a smear campaign about Stern and his company. Stern is suing to uncover the identity of the person behind the site.\nVacchi\u2019s complaint also alleges that Stern hid an \u201cextensive history of defrauding his investors\u00a0 forcing them to pursue legal actions like this one just to get their money back.\u201d The complaint dives into previous lawsuits that Stern has been involved in.\n\u201cTo make matters worse, Stern also hid that he had a long history of artificially prolonging those legal battles through abusive and deceptive litigation tactics, which any reasonable investor like GV NBV would have wanted to know when deciding whether to invest with Stern or any entity that he controls,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres is bucking the Loop\u2019s office downsizing narrative, inking a larger lease and consolidating its downtown space in a riverfront tower on LaSalle Street.\nThe fast-growing Chicago law firm signed a lease for about 40,000 square feet on the fifth floor of the building at 222 North LaSalle Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move will allow the firm to expand from the roughly 25,000 square feet it currently leases across two offices at the buildings at\n180 North LaSalle Street\nand\n191 North Wacker Drive\n, both of which it plans to vacate.\nThe deal stands out amid record high downtown office vacancy and a steady drumbeat of companies shedding space, as hybrid work settles in. While some large law firms have leaned into that trend, Croke Fairchild is moving in the opposite direction, joining a small but notable group of legal practices that have recently\ntaken bigger offices\n. According to the outlet, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago-based Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum have also expanded their downtown spaces over the past year.\nCroke Fairchild embraced remote work early, using flexibility as a recruiting tool and widening its talent pool, said managing partner and co-founder Drew Beres. But rapid growth changed the math on needed office space. The firm added 25 attorneys last year, bringing its headcount to about 110, and is increasingly running into space constraints when lawyers and staff choose to be in the office at the same time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed as we\u2019ve given people that freedom and flexibility, it seems like people want to come to the office even more,\u201d Beres told the outlet. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we accommodated that.\u201d\nThe 27-story, roughly 1 million-square-foot building at the southwest corner of LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive is owned by the Chicago-based Crown family and was already 93 percent leased before the deal, according to CoStar data. A spokesperson for the\nHenry Crown\nholding company did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s departure from the building at 180 North LaSalle will be felt more sharply. The 38-story tower, owned by Montreal-based La Caisse, is about 64 percent leased, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent, CoStar data shows, but the building at 180 North LaSalle sits across from the James R. Thompson Center, which Google is redeveloping into its Chicago headquarters, a nearby catalyst that could eventually lift demand.\nFilling space remains challenging: The Loop finished 2025 with a net loss of about 370,000 square feet of tenants compared with 2024, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 real estate trade group is beefing up its lobbying team, bringing in former government staffers to lead a push for housing reforms in Springfield and in Chicago.\nIllinois Realtors said on Monday that it was adding Melia Carter as vice president of governmental affairs. Anne Emerseon and Audrey Harding are joining as local government affairs directors to work with the\nChicago City Council\nand Cook County Board of Commissioners, respectively.\nJeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors, told\nThe Real Deal\nthe group is preparing to push for policies that increase density in Chicago and statewide, while opposing potential\nproperty tax hikes\nand tenant protections it argues would stifle investment.\nThe organization will work on \u201csecuring policies that increase housing inventory, incentivize homebuying and thwart burdensome property tax hikes and regulations,\u201d Baker said in a press release.\nCarter will manage Illinois Realtors\u2019 12-member government affairs team, according to the release. Most recently, she led Verizon\u2019s government affairs team across the Midwest and in Chicago.\nOn the local front, the association is bringing in insiders with deep ties to local governments to lead its lobbying efforts. Emerson, who will be focusing on Chicago, was chief of staff for the City Council\u2019s Finance Committee from 2019 to 2023, according to her LinkedIn. She most recently was senior vice president at Mercury Public Affairs.\nHarding, responsible for Cook County, is coming from a post as senior legislative assistant in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s intergovernmental affairs office. She has previously worked for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, first in Johnson\u2019s office and later for Commissioner Tara Stamps, according to her LinkedIn.\nThe 2026 agenda\nAt the state level,\nIllinois Realtors is backing five bills Baker called the \u201cHousing Stability &amp; Affordability Initiative.\u201d\nTwo of those bills aim to ease local zoning rules and allow for denser housing, Baker said. One would require cities to allow accessory dwelling units, a measure Chicago officials\nenacted in a limited form last year\n. Another would require larger cities to allow \u201cmiddle housing,\u201d including buildings with up to four units and townhomes, on lots of a certain size zoned for any residential use.\nOther pieces of their state-level platform include a cap on impact fees on new developments, and tax advantages for first-time homebuyers. The group is also pushing a bill that would eliminate \u201ccrime-free\u201d housing ordinances, which landlords and advocates have argued are used to discriminate against tenants based on race.\nIn Chicago, the organization will advocate for upzoning, especially near transit stations and on large lots, Baker said.\nIt will also continue opposing efforts to give tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their buildings, a measure that gained some traction last year and is in effect in some neighborhoods. Real estate groups say the policy makes it more difficult for landlords to sell their property and drives up housing costs.\n\u201cRealtors will also continue to be the largest advocate for property rights, whether that is from even more dramatic real estate taxes or restrictions on rentals that end up hurting tenants or driving homeownership further out of reach,\u201d he said.\nThe City Council passed an ordinance giving tenants in the\nSouth Shore and Woodlawn\nneighborhoods the right of first refusal to buy their buildings last year. Similar measures are in place in some\nNorthwest Side neighborhoods\nlike Logan Square and Avondale.\nBeyond the statehouse and city hall, the association plans to launch \u201chousing supply accelerators\u201d in 2026, Baker said. The program will target specific communities to study local zoning codes and recommend changes to bring down construction costs.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s ultra-luxury neighborhoods saw home prices rise to\nnever-before-seen numbers\nlast year.\nPrices in the San Francisco Association of Realtors\u2019 District 7,\ncomprising\nthe neighborhoods of Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights,\nthe Marina and Cow Hollow\n, hit their\nhighest-ever levels\nlast year, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a new\nreport\nfrom Compass.\nThe median sales price for houses in the district rose to $6 million in 2025, up 20 percent from the year prior. That marked the fastest increase among any part of the city recorded by Compass data. Across the city, the median house price was approximately $1.7 million last year.\nThe\nBay Area luxury housing\nsector at large saw an upswing last year as middle-income families have been shut out of the market due to economic uncertainty, high housing prices and less-than-deal mortgage rates, opening the door for wealthier households benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. In San Francisco specifically, the influx of\nAI workers and executives has driven up demand\nfor upscale homes so much that it has created a\nmansion shortage\nin the city. Bay Area tech workers and investors are likely also doing well from massive gains in the stock market, according to analysts.\n\u201cRight now, the economy is more favorable to wealthy people,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, told the Chronicle. That trend isn\u2019t expected to change in 2026, as this year is expected to bring San Francisco\u2019s hottest housing market since pre-pandemic times, Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle said.\nMost of the other Realtor districts in San Francisco haven\u2019t climbed back up to price peaks seen mid-pandemic when interest rates were at historic lows. Prices in the city, including the seventh Realtor district, fell in 2022 and 2023 as mortgage rate hikes poured cold water on a previously red-hot market.\nSince then, well-positioned buyers began shopping in Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, often without the need for a loan to buy a house. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping how many buyers we have coming to us who are all-cash, ready to go,\u201d Michelle Harris, a real estate agent with Compass, said. Homes selling for between $2.5 million and $5 million are being bought in a week or less, Harris said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dana Johnson,\none of Houston\u2019s top-ranked agents\n, left\nCompass\nfor Douglas Elliman this month.\nJohnson, whose deals last year included one of\nthe most expensive homes sold in Houston\n, joined Douglas Elliman after six years with Compass, citing Compass\u2019 growth as a reason for her departure.\n\u201cSometimes bigger isn\u2019t always better. I feel like at Douglas Elliman, the brand itself is a luxury brand, and that\u2019s what I sell,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCompass definitely is a luxury brand, but it\u2019s also really large. So you\u2019re not going to get the support that you need, or that I needed, in a broker.\u201d\nHouston has a narrower luxury market than other Texas metros, Johnson pointed out. That might explain why Houston enjoyed the fastest selling homes in Texas last year; Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio all had higher median days on market in the fall, according to\nRedfin\n. When\nAustin had one of the slowest markets in the country\nin October, with a median 104 days on market for luxury homes, Houston had a median of 52 days on market. Dallas and Fort Worth luxury homes both sold after a median 62 days on market, and San Antonio had a median of 91 days on the market.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have very much inventory. You can\u2019t be real choosy,\u201d Johnson said of luxury buyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small niche of where they\u2019re going to be, if they\u2019re going to buy a luxury house in Houston.\u201d\nFive of the city\u2019s top 10 luxury deals last year took place within one square mile in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Three of the others were in Memorial Villages.\nHowever, Houston\u2019s luxury market isn\u2019t just geographically tight. It also fields an exceptionally small league of agents compared to\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n\u2014 and Compass leads the group. In Dallas, 18 agents represented the 20 parties in the top 10 deals of 2025. In Austin, another 18 agents also represented the 20 parties in the top 10 sales. In Houston, just 10 agents were spread over the top 10 deals, according to\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s research.\nJohnson represented the buyer of the city\u2019s seventh-\nmost expensive residential sale last year\n, a 10,799-square-foot custom mansion at 11321 Green Vale Drive that was asking $9.8 million. Excluding Johnson\u2019s deal, eight of the top 10 residential sales in Harris County last year involved a Compass agent, usually either Laura Sweeney or Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes.\n\u201cWhen I joined Compass, there [were] a hundred agents. Now [there are] 800. It\u2019s just hard to get the support that you need when there\u2019s that many agents,\u201d Johnson said.\n",

        "content": "Trammell Crow is gearing up for another expansion at one of North Texas\u2019 biggest industrial hubs, filing plans for a new phase of its sprawling 35 Eagle development in far north Fort Worth.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow submitted filings for a fourth phase of the project at 2501 Eagle Parkway, near AllianceTexas, according to records with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the plans call for three new speculative industrial buildings totaling nearly 750,000 square feet, with individual structures sized at roughly 500,000 square feet, 107,000 square feet and 140,000 square feet. The filings peg construction costs at about $40 million.\nIf the plans move forward as filed, construction would begin in February and wrap up in April 2027. Alliance Architects is listed as the design firm. A\nTrammell Crow\nspokesperson declined to provide additional details, noting only that a formal announcement could come later.\nThe expansion would build on the scale Trammell Crow and its partner,\nPGIM Real Estate\n, have already achieved at\n35 Eagle\n. The industrial park spans nearly 5.9 million square feet along I-35 West, near the Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport and the BNSF Intermodal Center, according to Trammell Crow\u2019s website. The most recent phase included five buildings totaling about 2.1 million square feet, with the developer signaling it would pursue additional phases once that space stabilized.\nRecent activity suggests demand remains. In June, Taiwanese technology manufacturer\nWistron\nbought a 324,598-square-foot building within 35 Eagle from Trammell Crow as part of a broader North Texas push tied to its planned $750 million supercomputer manufacturing investment with Nvidia.\nFar north Fort Worth currently has the largest industrial construction pipeline in the U.S., with about 7.7 million square feet under development across 20 projects, according to CoStar.\nBeyond 35 Eagle, Trammell Crow remains active across the region, with projects underway near DFW International Airport, expansions at Passport Park and the Lake Vista Technology Park in Lewisville.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The final days of the Adams administration were busy. Here\u2019s a change that slipped under the radar.\nUnderstandably, the flurry of mayoral\nvetoes\nalongside last-minute\ndrama\non the Rent Guidelines Board garnered a lot of attention at the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 time in office.\nBut the administration also made some changes to environmental review, potentially making it a little easier for certain housing projects to move forward.\nAs part of updates to the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) Technical Manual last month, the administration permitted certain housing projects to complete a shorter Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), which typically takes six to eight months.\nThis change builds on the Green Fast Track\nadopted\nby the administration in 2024. Under that program, housing projects with fewer than 175 units in low-density districts or 250 units in medium- or high-density districts could avoid environmental review.\nBut projects with site-specific issues (such as those relating to air quality, coastal flooding, noise or hazardous materials) couldn\u2019t qualify. The changes last month allow projects that meet the density threshold under the Green Fast Track, but can\u2019t qualify due to site-specific issues, to complete a shorter EAS.\nThe city\u2019s ability to address environmental review-related delays is limited. More extensive changes require state action. State lawmakers have previously proposed exempting large affordable housing projects from environmental review, which passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nBut major change could be on the way. As part of her State of the State address, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to propose exempting a majority of housing projects from state environmental review,\nthe Wall Street Journal reports\n. She also wants to set a two-year maximum for projects that must undergo review.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What other housing-related policies will Hochul prioritize in her State of the State address on Tuesday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing you\u2019ve learned\n: Nonprofit New Destiny Housing is calling on the state to allocate $62.1 million to New York\u2019s supportive housing program in this year\u2019s budget. Last year\u2019s budget included a $17.8 million increase (40 percent) in funding for the New York State Supportive Housing Program, representing the largest investment in 40 years. In a statement, the nonprofit indicated that the governor needs to build on this investment in this year\u2019s budget.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, have moved into Gracie Mansion,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Roughly 15,000 nurses walked out of city hospitals on Monday after their union, the New York State Nurses Association, and several major hospital systems failed to reach an agreement over staffing levels, benefits and other issues,\nAssociated Press reports\n. The hospitals remain open and have hired temporary nurses during the strike.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Monday named Rafael Espinal, who formerly served on the City Council and the state Assembly, as the new commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$24.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 3,700 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nConnor Cuccinelli and Noble Black have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor 63 Crosby Street. The Soho landmark building is 32,400 square feet. Office investment company Vertex purchased the five-story building,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $13.9 million for 25 East 94th Street. The Upper East Side townhouse is 8,200 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Doyle Team has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 21,386-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 651 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford Stuyvesant.

        "content": "Newsday managed to publish an\nentire article\nabout the conversion of the JFK Hilton into affordable housing without naming the developers, Slate Property Group and RiseBoro Community Partnership.\nYou might ask, What\u2019s the big deal? But think about it. Would a daily newspaper run a story about a New York basketball team winning a playoff series without mentioning the Knicks?\nFor better or worse, it\u2019s pretty common for mainstream publications to cover development without paying much or any attention to the developers. If they are included at all, it\u2019s usually near the end of the piece.\nIn this case, Newsday gave full credit to the Hochul administration for the conversion of the hotel into apartments. Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s own\npress release\nat least cited the developers, but not until the sixth paragraph.\nFrom reading it, you\u2019d think she converted the hotel herself.\n\u201cGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced completion of Baisley Pond Park Residences, a 318-unit, $167 million affordable housing development in South Jamaica, Queens,\u201d it began.\n\u201cBy transforming a long-vacant hotel into hundreds of affordable homes,\u201d Hochul said in the second paragraph, \u201cwe\u2019re delivering real results for low-income and formerly homeless New Yorkers while making smarter use of existing buildings.\u201d\nThe project did get 29 percent of its funding \u2014 $48 million \u2014 from the state\u2019s HONDA fund, which Hochul helped to create. But, reality check: This is a private project by for-profit and nonprofit developers. It is not a state project.\nBefore we even give Hochul 29 percent of the credit, consider that HONDA, which stands for the\nHousing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act\n, has proven very difficult for projects to use, as\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a much more\ninformative story\nabout the Slate/RiseBoro project.\nTo be clear, I am not criticizing the governor. Her press office got her good publicity, which is what a press office is supposed to do. It also brought attention to a worthy project that might not have happened without the HONDA legislation.\nNor have I ever heard a developer complain about not being mentioned prominently in coverage by a general interest publication. Usually they are happy to stay under the media\u2019s radar because they are accustomed to being hammered.\nWhatever project they propose is criticized as:\nfor people who are too rich (billionaires! gentrifiers!) or too poor (homeless people! crime!)\nhaving too many bedrooms (children will flood local schools!) or not enough bedrooms (families need housing!)\ntoo far from the subway (traffic! parking!) or too close to the subway (crowded platforms and trains!)\nToo profitable (pure greed!) or too risky (that will never work \u2014 you should abandon it!)\nSlate and RiseBoro probably chuckled at being omitted from Newsday\u2019s piece but were surely glad to yield the spotlight to the governor. They know politicians\u2019 currency is praise and publicity. Developers\u2019 currency is permits and profits.\n",

        "content": "Dallas investor and conservationist J. Luther King added 5,000 more acres in the\nHill Country\nto his family\u2019s expansive holdings.\nThe King family acquired a 5,067-acre tract in McCulloch County dubbed the San Saba River Ranch, marking the first change in family ownership for the property since 1898. The centerpiece of the property is a mile-long stretch of the San Saba, which flows year-round. A dam on the property creates a 6-acre reservoir. Two other tributaries of the San Saba River also cross the property, which is about an hour from San Angelo.\nThe seller cleared much of the underbrush from the land, leaving scenic hardwoods and encouraging game population growth. The property also includes a four-bedroom, four-bathroom stone house and a skeet shooting range, according to the listing.\nThe sale price hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but the property was listed for $22.8 million, or $4,500 per acre. The Haynes Team with Triangle Realty co-listed the property with Dullnig Ranch Sales.\nWhile the market for land is subject to the same\nlull affecting Texas luxury homes\nafter the hot streak of 2021 and 2022,\nlive water\nand optimal game conditions continue to generate demand, according to Dullnig Ranch Sales owner Robert Dullnig.\n\u201c\nProximity to metropolitan areas\ndrives a lot of it, so when you get into some areas that are over two hours away, and you don\u2019t have the live water or the big whitetail, those properties are probably taking a little longer to sell,\u201d Dullnig said.\nKing founded Luther King Capital Management Corporation, a Dallas-based investment advisory firm. He and his family own more than 100,000 acres across six Texas counties, including the 4K Livermore in the Davis Mountains and the 4K Brady Creek Ranch.\nThe Kings are about 200,000 acres away from the\ntop 10 list of the largest landowners in Texas\n. The list is topped by the Texas Pacific Land Corporation, the legacy company of the Texas and Pacific Railway. The list ends with commodities broker Mike Smith, who owns 323,000 acres.\n",

        "content": "Days after the Summit Properties\nwon a bankruptcy auction\nfor 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group, the city has filed a formal objection to the sale.\nLawyers for Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s office asked a judge to stop the transaction, raising questions about insider dealing and saying that Summit has failed to show the ability to fix up the properties. It\u2019s\nthe second time\nthe Mamdani administration has objected to the bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe objection is a last-ditch attempt by the Mamdani administration to throw its might behind tenants at the Pinnacle properties. A confirmation hearing for the sale is scheduled for Thursday.\n\u201cOur north stars in these proceedings have always been improving the habitability of the buildings in this portfolio and protecting their rent-stabilized status,\u201d said Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor for housing, in a statement. \u201cAny sale of the Pinnacle portfolio, whether to Summit Gold, Inc. or another bidder, must lead to improved conditions for tenants.\u201d\nThe city argued in its objection that the sale deserves higher scrutiny because of the possibility of insider involvement. That appears to be an oblique reference to a Bisnow report last week that revealed\nJonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle head Joel Wiener\n, signed several deeds for properties that Summit claims to own. A declaration from the state attorney general\u2019s office supporting the city\u2019s effort detailed the connections between Summit and Jonathan Wiener. Summit has denied that Jonathan Wiener had any involvement in the sale.\nThe city previously said it has yet to see evidence that Summit has the\nwillingness and ability to fix housing code violations at the properties\n, arguing in court that the legal rents in the units were too low for Summit to both fix the units and profit from the sale.\nThe objection also referenced housing code violations at Summit\u2019s existing properties, which a declaration by the attorney general\u2019s office places around 4,000 open violations in a current portfolio of 3,000 units.\n\u201cThe City submits that Summit must demonstrate that it has the resources, and moreover, the willingness and intent to cure the violations within the time period required by law and, if necessary, rehabilitate the Properties, while remaining financially sustainable,\u201d the objection reads.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the city should be given time to come up with another buyer who would take better care of the buildings, or is at least owed a deeper explanation from Summit about its management plan.\nA spokesperson for Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the objection but the company has said it intends to invest in the portfolio, maintain affordability and hire new management firms.\n\u201cSummit has sufficient resources and capital to honor and perform all obligations under the existing resident leases and comply with all regulatory obligations,\u201d it said in a statement to the court. \u201cSummit also is committed to a long-term housing investment and maintaining the quality and affordability of apartments in its portfolio of Pinnacle properties.\u201d\nThe city also objected to the auction before it took place, hoping for a 30-day delay. But the judge\nthrew out that effort\nlast week.\n",

        "content": "Matthew Whitman Lazenby, whose family has owned Bal Harbour Shops since its inception 61 years ago, is in a dog fight with estranged wife, Kristin Lazenby.\nMatthew\nis trying to block Kristin from gaining access to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, and he\u2019s seeking a court order to remove a foster dog she adopted from their home in Asheville, North Carolina. Those are the latest salvos in the couple\u2019s bitter divorce proceedings that began more than a year ago, court records show.\nKristin wants bank statements, canceled checks and general ledgers for Whitman Family Development, the entity that owns Bal Harbour Shops at 9700 Collins Avenue. She wants Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in the luxury mall to be considered a marital asset.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Bal Harbour Shops have been thrust into the Lazenbys\u2019 divorce proceedings which were intended to be a private matter,\u201d Matthew\u2019s attorney Kathyrn Hamilton said in an email statement. \u201cMr. Lazenby\u2019s personal involvement in this multi-generational family business predates their marriage.\u201d\nKristin\u2019s lawyer Paul Leinoff did not respond to requests for comment.\nBal Harbour Shops traces its origins to the late developer\nStanley Whitman\n, who in 1957 acquired a former World War II army barracks site in the village of Bal Harbour. He created an open-air shopping center featuring designer brands in a tropical garden setting, opening Bal Harbour Shops in 1965. Whitman, who died in 2017, was Matthew\u2019s grandfather.\nBal Harbour Shops features landscaped, breezy walkways lined with retailers such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bvlgari, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ferragamo and Prada, as well as department stores Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.\nWhitman Family Development is renovating and expanding Bal Harbour Shops by 200,000 square feet, securing a\n$550 million\nloan in 2019 for the project. The mall owner landed a\n$740 million\nrefinancing in 2024.\nTussle over Bal Harbour Shops data\nMatthew is Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 CEO and the operating general partner for Whitman Family Development, whose chairman is Randall Whitman, Matthew\u2019s uncle. Matthew joined the family business in 2003 and rose to his current position a decade later, according to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 website.\nHe married Kristin in 2009, and they have three children, court records show. She filed for divorce on in July 2024, alleging the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d\nShe is seeking alimony, attorney fees and an equitable distribution of marital assets, which includes three homes, in Bal Harbour, Santa Rosa Beach and Asheville, where she lives with the three kids, her divorce petition states.\nThe couple has duked it out in court motions in recent months. At an October hearing over her demands to see Whitman Family Development\u2019s books, Philip Schecter, a forensic accountant hired by Kristin\u2019s legal team, testified that he needs to know if Matthew is signing a majority of the checks and payments for\nWhitman Family Development\nto determine if Matthew has an \u201cactive participation in the entity.\u201d\nKristin contends in her filings that Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in Whitman Family Development could be considered a marital asset. Schecter explained that if Matthew is \u201csigning hundreds of checks over a 12-year period\u201d for Whitman Family Development that would show he\u2019s the chief decision maker, as well as determine whether Matthew has paid himself any profit disbursements from the company.\nLeinoff, Kristin\u2019s attorney, told Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Christine Bandin, who is presiding over the case, that Matthew acquired his general partnership interest during the marriage.\nLeinoff said during the hearing that he needed the information to identify what the marital interest is and what the value is, prior to conducting depositions.\nHamilton, Matthew\u2019s attorney, pushed back. She noted Whitman Family Development was formed by Stanley Whitman and his brothers, and that Kristin had not provided proof that \u201cmarital funds\u201d were used to acquire an interest in the company.\nFoster dog caught in the fray\nAs Matthew tangles with Kristin over Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, he is also seeking to kick out a recent pet addition to their Asheville household. According to a motion filed the same day as the October hearing, Matthew claimed Kristin \u201cunilaterally fostered [a dog] on a temporary basis without the husband\u2019s knowledge or consent, and the wife had the audacity to \u2018double down\u2019 and has now informed the Husband that she has adopted the dog.\u201d\nMatthew alleges the dog killed Lewey and Dewey, the family\u2019s pet birds, and destroyed furniture and personal property inside the Asheville property. His estranged wife also allegedly let the foster and their two other dogs have free rein in the house.\nMatthew lives in Florida 51 percent of the year, splitting his time between the couple\u2019s homes in Bal Harbour and Santa Rosa Beach, according to court filings.\n\u201cThe most recent catastrophe caused by the wife has resulted in the expensive Ipe hardwood flooring in the mudroom being destroyed,\u201d the motion alleges. \u201cThis happened because the wife deliberately left the dog door closed, thereby preventing the family dogs from going outside to go potty.\u201d\nWhen Matthew returned home, he found \u201ca minefield of dried-up excrement everywhere, including all over the floors, the walls, and the doors,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe wife undoubtedly left this mess to sink into the flooring overnight because she did not want to bother cleaning it, requiring the husband to spend over an hour to clean it up himself.\u201d\nMatthew wants a court order to boot the foster dog or to give Matthew sole, exclusive use of the Asheville house. In a response filed in November, Kristin accused Matthew of violating a May 2025 agreement to settle some of their temporary conflicts, including allowing both of them to stay in the Asheville house. During a deposition, Matthew confirmed that he\u2019s \u201cnow seeking the wife\u2019s removal from her home,\u201d Kristin\u2019s motion states.\nA hearing on the dog and the house is set for April.",

Industry experts intend to watch them grow this year.\nThe office market is finding its footing in the post-pandemic new normal, logging positive annual absorption of office space for the first time since 2019, according to JLL\u2019s fourth quarter report. Last year wrapped up with 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption \u2014 a marked improvement from 2024 when the market saw its first quarter of positive absorption in the fourth quarter, but still ended the year with nearly 1.5 million square feet of negative absorption.\nNormalizing conditions have two trends to thank. First, return to work mandates from major employers like AT&amp;T, Toyota and JP Morgan gave the market a boost. Second, the development pipeline shrank, reaching its lowest level since 2012.\nFor better or for worse, part of the market\u2019s new normal is its stubborn vacancy rate. The market may be settling in, but it\u2019s still carrying around a lot of dead weight. At the end of the fourth quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s vacancy rate was 27.2 percent, a slight tick up from the same period of the year before when vacancy was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nOffice trades return\nDallas\u2019 sales volume has bounced back, in another example of office market normalization. Buyers returned to the market in 2025, and the year was robust for office trades, which reached levels not seen since 2022.\nIn 2024, almost all of the\nmarket\u2019s largest office trades\nwere scattered around the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. The list included distress buys and office/industrial flex properties.\nLast year, investors got excited about Y\u2019all Street and opened their wallets for Uptown trophies. Cousins Properties kicked off the Uptown spree in July with its\npurchase of The Link at Uptown\nfor $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot.\nCrescent Real Estate topped that trade in September when it picked up\nTexas Capital Center,\nat 2000 McKinney Street. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price, but said in a release that the sale represented \u201ca significant value increase.\u201d The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016.\nExperts predict 2026 will build on these wins: \u201cCapital is back and ready to be deployed,\u201d JLL wrote.\nElephant in the room\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows for the Dallas office market heading into the new year.\nA blemish on the market, the\nsorry state of Downtown Dallas\n, is starting to look more like a wound.\nAT&amp;T dropped a bomb\non the\nstruggling urban core\nwhen it announced last week that it plans to leave its 2 million-square-foot downtown office space for a new 54-acre campus in Plano.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s chunk of the office market makes up almost 6 percent of the submarket\u2019s total space, and its upcoming exit \u2014 which could happen as soon as 2028 \u2014 is sure to push the area\u2019s elevated vacancy rate even higher. The central business district has a vacancy rate of about 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nThe submarket suffered another blow when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd announced\nhe\u2019s handing back the keys to The National\n, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refinancing in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in 2020.\n",

The deal for the five-story, 80,000-square-foot building breaks down to $888 per square foot.\nBritish real estate firm Epic sold the property, which is also known as 15 Little West 12th Street. The company purchased the property for $69 million in 2011, suggesting there was not much profit to be had for the boutique office and retail building, which was developed by Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital Management.\nTenants include Red Bull, energy company Kimmeridge and the Match Group, parent company of dating services Tinder and Hinge. The estimated rent for office space at the property ranges from $82 to $100 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nTPG and Aurora did not respond to requests for comment on the deal.\nAurora is already one of the largest owners in the neighborhood, ranking up there with William Gottlieb Real Estate. This may be TPG\u2019s first foray into the Meatpacking District, though.\nBobby Cayre founded Aurora in 2001, focused on \u201chigh street\u201d retail. It has since expanded out into developing ground-up boutique office and retail projects, as well as the occasional residential. In August, the company made news when Aurora snagged a signed contract for a penthouse at 140 Jane Street\nasking $87.5 million\n.\nTPG just made a massive deal of its own to start the year,\nbuying a majority stake\nin Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm, Quarterra. TPG Real Estate plans to invest $1 billion in the business and could raise additional capital for growth; Quarterra has built 43,000 apartments across the country since 2011 and has another 13,000 in the pipeline.\nElsewhere in the Meatpacking District, Bilt recently\nsigned a 58,000-square-foot lease\nto take over Samsung\u2019s former office at 837 Washington Street.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate plays a major role in this year\u2019s Florida legislative session.\nLawmakers will take up proposals this session that would streamline approvals for rural master-planned communities, tweak the controversial Live Local Act, and target homeowners associations. Also up for votes are numerous proposals for property tax alleviation for homeowners who receive a homestead exemption.\nThe session starts today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tap for real estate:\nLive Local tweaks\nSen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, proposed an expansion of the Live Local Act, a workforce housing law that\u2019s riled some counties and municipalities since it was approved in 2023.\nLive Local allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations and public meetings if they designate 40 percent of the units in their projects for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThey can obtain approvals administratively and build up to the tallest height permitted within a mile and the highest density allowed in a jurisdiction. It also grants developers property tax exemptions.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the legislation with a flurry of applications, while some municipalities have decried the Live Local Act for curtailing their say over development. The law has been especially\ncontentious\nin the tri-county region\u2019s\nsmall coastal communities\nthat have maintained strict development regulations and\nfought back large projects\n.\nCalatayud\u2019s\nSenate Bill 1548\nwould expand Live Local to include properties owned by counties, municipalities and schools districts, and it would curb localities\u2019 ability to restrict height via setbacks and stepbacks. The proposal would clarify that farms and farm operations aren\u2019t commercial properties and don\u2019t qualify for Live Local projects.\nAffordability\nLegislators also want to extend the affordability requirement under the Live Local Act.\nUnder the law, the below-market units have to remain as such for at least 30 years.\nHouse Bill 675\n/\nSenate Bill 756\naim to increase this to 50 years.\nIt would also tighten the affordability requirements for developers to get tax abatements. The law allows landlords to obtain a 75 percent property tax break for all units designated for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI. The bills would drop the upper thresholds to 100 percent of the AMI.\nPost-hurricane rebuilding\nLast year, the legislature approved SB 180, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d part of which banned local governments from imposing comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations and site plan approval procedures that could be deemed \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome.\u201d The law applies to counties and municipalities included in federal disaster declarations within 100 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track.\nIt\u2019s meant to remove roadblocks to rebuilding after three hurricanes hit the state in 2024, imposing the restrictions through 2027. For all future hurricanes, the law restricts tighter development regulations for a year.\nBut the controversial proposal riled some local governments that argued it further erodes \u201chome rule\u201d authority over development regulations and potentially opens the door to developers invoking SB 180 over any local zoning change that stands in the way of proposed projects. Several South Florida municipalities joined as plaintiffs in a\nlawsuit\nlast year against SB 180, including Bal Harbour, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead and Palm Beach.\nSen. Nick DiCeglie, a Republican from St. Petersburg, filed\nSenate Bill 840\n, partly curbing the previous legislation.\nThis proposal would hand more control back to counties and cities over development rules, rolling back previously imposed limits.\nIt would roll back the temporary ban on local regulations tied to 2024\u2019s hurricanes until this year. For future storms, it would limit the one-year ban on zoning changes to damaged properties only.\nIt also would narrow the scope of SB 180 to cities and municipalities within 50 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track, while allowing localities to enforce a reconstruction moratorium if it\u2019s to address stormwater, flood management and potable water supply, or sewer repairs.\nRural homebuilding\nLandowners of at least 10,000 acres could bypass county and municipal zoning and other regulations under\nSenate Bill 354\n/\nHouse Bill 299\n, as long as they meet certain development conditions, including the creation of affordable housing.\nCreating \u201cBlue Ribbon Projects,\u201d the proposals add to initiatives that stirred controversy over their potential erosion of local governments\u2019 say over growth and development, and concerns over suburban sprawl.\nUnder the proposals, 60 percent of the land must be reserved for environmental conservation, wildlife corridors, agriculture or other open spaces, and the rest can be developed with up to 12 units per acre. At least 20 percent of residential units must be affordable, workforce housing, or homes for people who qualify under the Florida Hometown Hero Program, including teachers and police.\nQualifying projects can be approved administratively, allowing them to bypass public hearings.\nRep. Lauren Melo, a Naples Republican, and Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican representing Ocala, sponsored the bills.\nNew York-based investment manager Ruane Cunniff, which has amassed roughly 80,000 acres in north Florida counties since 2017, is backing the bills through an affiliate, including hiring lobbyists pushing for the legislation, independent investigative journalist Jason Garcia\nreported\n. Ruane Cunniff has paid at least $230 million for land in rural areas.\nTax breaks\nAfter Gov. Ron DeSantis floated the idea last year of eliminating property taxes for homesteaded residences, lawmakers put forth\noptions\nto achieve it this session.\nThe move would require\nconstitutional amendments\nand approval from Florida voters in November.\nThe resolutions would exempt property taxes funding school districts and mandate that county and municipal budgets for law enforcement should not be reduced.\nHouse joint resolution 201\n, filed by Republican Rep. Monique Miller of\u00a0 Palm Bay, would eliminate all non-school property taxes for homes. Miller\u2019s\njoint resolution 203\nproposes to increase the value of homestead exemptions by $100,000 each year for 10 years starting in 2027, phasing out property taxes by 2037.\nHJR 205\n, filed by Republican Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, would eliminate property taxes for homeowners who are 65 and older.\nRep. DeFuniak Springs, a Republican representing a portion of the Panhandle, filed\nHJR 207\n, proposing to add homestead exemptions for 25 percent of the home\u2019s assessed value after all other exemptions are applied.\nLocal governments, including Orlando and Orange County, have warned the proposals could hit\nbudgets\nfor parks, infrastructure maintenance and improvements, fire departments and other services.\nHOAs\nPorras is going after homeowners associations this session.\nResidents living in HOAs across the state have accused some board members of wrongdoing including election interference, misappropriation of funds, unjustified assessment increases, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case was at the\nHammocks\nin West Kendall, South Florida\u2019s largest HOA on 3,800 acres and with 18,000 residents.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, proposed legislation that would allow residents to disband their HOAs. But attorneys say it\nwon\u2019t work\n.\nUnder\nHouse Bill 657\n, residents could start the dismantling process with a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners, which the board must vote on at a meeting and also set the termination rules, requiring approval by two-thirds of homeowners. The plan of termination would be filed in court, and a termination trustee, such as the board or someone appointed, would oversee the dismantling of the HOA, including the sale of assets.\nExperts in HOA law said this would be difficult, because HOAs own infrastructure such as stormwater and sewer systems, landscaping and roads, and not just sellable assets such as maintenance equipment.\n\u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets?\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cWho is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nCounties and municipalities would be reluctant to assume responsibility for this infrastructure partly because it could mean increasing taxes to maintain common areas that only HOA residents use, attorneys said.\nHB 657 has other provisions, some of which attorneys hailed. It would create a Community Association Court, alleviating the backlog of HOA and condo association cases at circuit courts.",

He and his wife Monique made the donation in honor of Alon\u2019s mother, Liora Abady.\n\u201cWhen we moved to the States in the late 70s, we had nothing,\u201d said Alon, whose mother found a job with Chabad after the family immigrated to Los Angeles. \u201cThey were there for us when we first came here and that carried a personal weight.\u201d\nAbady, who is managing partner of Waterfall Bridge Capital, paid Blackstone $35 million, or about $140 per square foot, for the property in 2023 with plans to redevelop it. That could still happen with the property holding by-right entitlements, which holds the door open for a possible residential conversion.\nHowever, plans in the near future call for the building to serve as the Chabad Campus for Jewish Life, which will encompass a synagogue, educational facilities, mental and social services, a banquet and events hall and the Abady Family Center once fully operational.\nAbady described the building as \u201cspecial\u201d and an \u201ciconic LA property,\u201d sitting between Culver City and Beverly Hills. Fox Studios is located next door, while Hillcrest Country Club sits opposite the property. In a sea of mostly low-rise commercial or multifamily structures, 9911 Pico Boulevard can be seen driving from the east or west.\nAbady\u2019s latest deal, which closed on Friday, is different from some of the other trades tied to his name within the local marketplace.\nThe investor is best known for his $96 million purchase of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, but his name is also known in high-end residential real estate.\nThat portfolio includes the 2020, $25 million purchase of\nSimon Cowell\n\u2019s former home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, which Abady flipped for $34 million three years later. Also in 2023, Abady sold a property in the gated Madison Club community of La Quinta to Justin and Hailey Bieber for $16.6 million. More recently, in 2024, he paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way, which was previously owned by conservationists\nDan and Susan Gottlieb\n.\n",

        "content": "A newly built home in\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Hill Section neighborhood found a buyer last week to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s top residential property to go into contract.\nBuilt in the trendy modern farmhouse style, the six-bed, eight-bath home of more than 6,000 square feet was asking $8.8 million, or $1,424 per square foot.\nThe property appeared in the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which ranks signed contracts based on asking price. Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team compiles the weekly report, which uses Multiple Listing Service data and an asking price floor of $4 million.\nIf the deal on 711 North Dianthus Street closes, the buyer will walk away with a discount from the original ask of $9.3 million, when the home first hit the market in March.\nProperty records show an entity called BM Investments scooped up the home in 2022 for $2.6 million, with state filings tying the limited liability company to real estate investor Bedros Najarian and the Hawthorne address of a company called Doon Builders.\nThe listing is held by Thompson Team Real Estate\u2019s Joseph Nuzzolo.\nThe property\u2019s location in the Hill Section places it in the same neighborhood as Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\n.\nAlthough, the home Don\u010di\u0107 paid for last August amounted to $25 million for what was previously tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s former pad. That off-market closing edged past the $24.5 million sale of\n1800 The Strand\nas Manhattan Beach\u2019s priciest residential sale on record.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest listing to fall into contract, according to the Eklund Gomes report, was 2311 Worthing Lane, located in the Bel Air Crest community.\nDesigned as an East Coast traditional-style home, the property is listed for just under $8 million, or $864 per square foot.\nIt counts five beds and 7 baths across 9,200 square feet, with the listing held by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter.\nThe home first hit the market in September asking nearly $9 million before seeing a price reduction the following month.\nProperty records and listing sites show the home last sold in 2011 for $3.2 million and is currently owned by a trust tied to Brian and Mira Lee. Brian is a serial entrepreneur, who co-founded LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Honest Co.\nAcross Los Angeles County, signed contract activity last week shook out to be about on par with the year-ago period. A total of 13 homes went into contract, equating to about $77 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\n",

The loan is considered current and ownership prefunded shortfalls for the next 12 months, as well as a $1.5 million leasing reserve, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics.\nNo modification was made to the mortgage, which matures in three years. Ownership also dodged a workout fee from the special servicer.\nIt\u2019s an abrupt improvement of fortunes for an ownership group that also includes Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, none of whom commented on the latest development.\nThe debt behind the Class A office building was sent to special servicing in October after the borrower failed to meet payment obligations. A month later, a Piper Sandler analyst predicted the building\u2019s lenders would soon take possession of the property and work on a quick sale.\nOwnership secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy quickly fell off.\nOccupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued, but Ralph Lauren \u2014 which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building \u2014\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\npaying\nabout 30 percent less in rent.\nOccupancy dropped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is all the way back up to 98 percent, per CoStar. Office tenants include Lakewood Capital, while retail space is occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property saw its value fall; once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nThe 28-story office and retail building totals 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by Vornado, Oxford and the pension fund in 2013 for roughly $1.3 billion.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-gestating South Side Chicago megadevelopment spearheaded by leadership of the Apostolic Church of God is moving closer to reality, with its first phase set to face city zoning and planning officials this month.\nDeveloper J. Byron Brazier, son of longtime Apostolic Church pastor Byron Brazier, applied for a zoning change for the initial phase of Woodlawn Central, an 8-acre, church-controlled \u201ccultural\u201d complex planned along the 63rd Street corridor, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The application would amend a planned development designation originally approved for the site two decades ago.\nThe\nfirst phase\ntargets an Apostolic Church parking lot bounded by 63rd and 64th streets, Dorchester Avenue and the Metra Electric tracks. Plans call for two buildings rising from a block-long podium, with a 14-story, roughly 160-foot-tall structure with 231 apartments units, a hotel, 23,000 square feet of retail and another 3,500 square feet of commercial space.\nThe\nbase\nwould house retail and residential and hotel lobbies on the ground floor, with parking decks on the second and third floors. The buildings above would hold the apartments and hotel rooms. The project would include 300 parking spaces for cars and 260 bicycle spots, a notable ratio for a transit-adjacent site near the 63rd Street Metra station.\nAs required under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, 20 percent of the units would be set aside for households earning up to 60 percent of area median income, which equates to $71,940 for a family of four. Brazier framed the project as an economic development play as much as a housing one, emphasizing jobs, workforce pipelines and income growth as tools to attract market-rate investment without displacement.\nIf introduced as planned at the Jan. 21 Chicago City Council meeting, the proposal would still need approval from the plan commission, the zoning committee and the full council.\nWoodlawn Central\nwas first unveiled in 2021 as a sweeping, multiyear vision for church-owned parcels nearby. At full buildout, the project is expected to include about 870 housing units across workforce, market-rate, luxury and senior categories, along with roughly 215,000 square feet of office and retail space. Later phases include a performance venue, a district-scale energy facility, a vertical greenhouse and renovations to the historic headhouse at the 63rd Street Metra Electric station.\nThe zoning push lands amid a broader development wave in Woodlawn tied to the Obama Presidential Center, slated to open in June. City Council last fall approved a separate\n26-story hotel\na few blocks east at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue, backed by Aquinnah Investment Trust, led by Allison Davis, a onetime boss of Barack Obama.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In 2020, federal investigators charged Acharya with defrauding hundreds of investors out of $119 million that they had invested in an unknown number of projects by Acharya and Silicon Sage across the Bay Area. Authorities claimed Acharya and Silicon Sage, like fellow\nembattled Bay Area developer Ken Mattson\n, would shift money around from investors to various bank accounts to keep cash flows active. Silicon Sage and Acharya had 77 different bank accounts in total and made at least 130,000 banking transactions over a period of eight years.\nAcharya was caught when authorities homed in on the activities of seven entities that Acharya and his company controlled. \u201cThe transactions that the receiver\u2019s forensic accountant analyzed consistently demonstrated that money put into a specific entity would be transferred through multiple accounts, usually within a matter of minutes, before ending up in the account of an entity that needed to make payments that day,\u201d the receiver said in a U.S. District Court filing on Dec. 3. He settled his case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission in 2021.\nA court-appointed receiver hired Acres Loan Origination, the senior construction lender for the 96-unit Almaden Road complex in\nSan Jose\nand the 91-unit Osgood Road development in Fremont, to complete the projects. The money earned from these condo unit sales was supposed to go to investors and other creditors who lost money in Acharya\u2019s web of alleged fraud, but the effort soon hit a snag.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the cost to complete the projects exceeded the original estimates and took longer than anticipated,\u201d Kyra Andrassy, a legal counsel for the receiver, said in legal documents. The attorney cited \u201ceconomic repercussions of the pandemic and supply chain issues,\u201d in addition to the failure of Acharya and Silicon Sage Builders as professional developers, as hurdles that proved difficult to overcome.\n\u201cMuch of the work that had been completed prior to the receiver\u2019s appointment needed to be redone or repaired because of shoddy workmanship,\u201d the receiver told the court.\nThe Osgood development in Fremont was completed in early 2024 and had sold all of its units by June of that year. Acres received $62.7 million from the sale of the condos in that building. In San Jose, the Almaden project was completed in late 2024, but sales have been slower than anticipated. As of early last month, 45 condos had been sold, while another 12 were in escrow and the other 39 were still available for sale. Acres has received $28.8 million in proceeds from that project so far.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul wants to make it easier to build in New York, while also cracking down on bad landlords and cutting down on property owner costs.\nIn her fifth State of the State address, Hochul will unveil her \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, which includes speeding up housing and infrastructure projects. She will also back\nefforts\nto create new criminal charges for landlords that repeatedly harass tenants across their portfolios.\nHochul\u2019s agenda echoes the\nearly approach\nof Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who has simultaneously taken steps aimed at easing housing construction while also ramping up enforcement actions against landlords. Her policy priorities in the book, however, do not include increasing taxes on corporations or the state\u2019s wealthiest individuals \u2014\u00a0proposals key to paying for some of the mayor\u2019s top campaign promises.\nSpeeding up the building process\nAs part of \u201cLet Them Build,\u201d the governor pitches exempting certain housing projects from the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA, according to the\nState of the State book\n, which lays out the governor\u2019s policy priorities for the year.\nThe governor calls for allowing housing projects that have no significant impact on the environment and are compliant with local zoning to avoid environmental review. Projects must be outside flood risk areas to qualify and still need to abide by state rules related to water use, air quality, environmental justice and protection of natural resources.\nThe book doesn\u2019t get into specifics, but notes that the state will establish different density caps for projects eligible in New York City, based on neighborhood density. Elsewhere in the state, projects can only qualify if located on \u201cpreviously disturbed\u201d land and connected to existing water and sewer systems.\nUnder Hochul\u2019s proposal, certain green and other infrastructure projects, including nature-based storm water management, public parks and recreational bike/pedestrian paths, could avoid review.\nThe governor also wants to cap the review process at two years and to clarify the timeline for waging a legal challenge to these reviews. She additionally is calling on state agencies that review and approve permits to assess their processes and find ways to speed up approvals. Agencies must issue recommendations by Sept. 1.\nHochul similarly\nproposed\ncarveouts for small housing projects, those spanning no more than 10,000 square feet, as part of her State of the State last year.\nThis year\u2019s more ambitious proposal comes after California successfully\nexempted\ninfill housing from its state environmental review process.\nEnvironmental review can add years to a project\u2019s timeline. New York City has tinkered with the city version of environmental review, allowing some housing projects to either\nskip review\nor undergo a\nshortened one\n. The state rules, however, set minimum requirements for localities to follow, meaning that significant change requires action by state.\nSen. Rachel May previously proposed legislation that would exempt much larger affordable housing projects, those consisting of up to 1,000 units, from environmental review. The measure passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nThe policy book notes that an analysis by the city and state of 1,000 projects found that \u201cvirtually none of such projects ultimately were found to have significant environmental impacts.\u201d\nOther multifamily moves\nHochul also supports legislation that would upgrade felony charges against landlords who systematically harass rent-regulated tenants across multiple buildings or are \u201crepeat serious offenders.\u201d At the urging of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Sen. Brian Kavanaugh and Assembly member Micah Lasher introduced similar\nlegislation\nlast year.\nThe governor\u2019s policy priorities include some initiatives aimed at decreasing costs of multifamily property owners, but do not include changes that would allow for increasing rents on vacant stabilized apartments, as landlord groups have sought.\nHochul proposes reforming the property tax break J-51, which expires in June. The City Council\nrevived\nthe incentive in 2024, more than a year after the state\napproved\na new version of the tax break that limited the pool of eligible buildings. The abatement is provided to owners who renovate their stabilized apartment buildings, which must be at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or otherwise receiving \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nOwners have previously blamed outdated price schedules \u2014\u00a0which are used to determine the value of the break \u2014\u00a0for making the program unappealing. The most recent iteration of the abatement creates too narrow a universe of eligible buildings, according to landlord groups.\nThe State of the State book cites \u201cadministrative challenges\u201d as a reason that owners haven\u2019t sought the incentive, but doesn\u2019t provide details on a new program.\nThe governor doesn\u2019t mention property tax reform, nor alternative property insurance models, which are frequently floated as possible cost-cutting initiatives for owners. The State of the State book, however, proposes expanding insurance discounts for homeowners and multifamily owners, and also ramping up reporting requirements for insurance providers.\nThe governor is also seeking to increase income eligibility for Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE), programs that provide tax credits to landlords in exchange for freezing rents for certain senior and disabled tenants.\nHochul wants to allocate $250 million to \u201caccelerate affordable housing\u201d this year, adding to her $25 billion, five-year housing plan announced in 2022. The State of the State book doesn\u2019t mention funding for the state-based housing voucher program\napproved\nlast year.\nTuesday\u2019s address comes as Hochul faces a challenge on the left from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman on the right in her re-election campaign. Some socialist lawmakers, including state Sen. Jabari Brisport and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, have endorsed Delgado.\nThe election already seems to be shaping the governor\u2019s policy agenda this year. In an answer to Mamdani\u2019s pledge for free childcare, Hochul\nannounced\na $4.5 million plan this month to expand free and low-cost childcare across the state. She also proposed eliminating state income taxes on up to $25,000 of tipped income, following a federal rule\npromoted\nby President Donald Trump.\n",

A web of LLCs and political action committees link the funds and Lambert\u2019s campaign to some of the biggest developers in Palm Beach County, including Steve Ross, Jorge P\u00e9rez, Isaac Toledano and Bobby Julien.\nKeith James, the mayor of West Palm Beach since 2019 and longtime industry ally, is term-limited and leaving office next year. The stakes are high for developers as power changes hands, and their political spending reflects as much.\nAt least $121,000 of the funds raised came from real estate donors, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nLambert has received donations from the Morrison family\u2019s Sympatico Real Estate,\nWexford Real Estate Investors\nand Blair Brandt, top Palm Beach agent\nMargit Brandt\u2019s\nhusband and chief marketing officer.

        "content": "Wellington narrowly approved zoning changes that would allow former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and Mike Meldman\u2019s Discovery Land Company to transform a polo field into a mixed-use project with homes, an equestrian complex and private club.\nOn Monday, the village council voted 3 to 2 on first reading to move the Isla Carroll Polo and Residences development forward.\nMayor Michael Napoloeone cautioned that the plans need extensive changes if the developers hope to secure approval for second and final reading in February \u2014 despite assurances that the development\u2019s polo field would be used by the United States Polo Association.\n\u201cIn the interest of preserving the [polo] field I am giving you another shot, but I don\u2019t know how you are going to get there unless there are fundamental changes,\u201d said Napoleone, who voted yes along with Vice Mayor Tanya Siskin and Councilman John McGovern. Councilwoman Maria S. Antuna and Councilwoman Amanda Silvestri voted no.\nNew York-based McCourt Partners and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Discover Land Company want to redevelop the 79.2-acre former East Isla Caroll at 3665 120th Avenue South in polo-centric Wellington into a development that would include an equestrian complex with a polo field and a private club with a polo observation deck, restaurants, a spa, racquet sports, gym, and polo training simulators.\nThe rezoning portion of the developers\u2019 request centered on being able to build 40 single-family homes on lots averaging a half acre. Under the property\u2019s present zoning, those 40 houses must be built on lots that are two acres each, large enough for an owner to construct a home with a horse stable, in keeping with Wellington\u2019s equestrian preservation zone.\nMcCourt, who said he traveled from Cairo, Egypt to speak at the meeting, told council members that he wanted to make sure his development benefited the sport of polo. He did not want it to become \u201canother soulless subdivision.\u201d\n\u201cWe have gone to great lengths to comply with your code and not ask for a single thing we are not entitled to,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cThis is a project we\u2019re extremely proud of and we have a lot of people supporting it.\u201d\nMcCourt\u2019s attorney Neil Schiller said the project has 120 letters of support and the backing of Wellington\u2019s planning staff. Among those speaking in favor was Stewart Armstrong, chairman of the USPA, who confirmed the organization has an agreement to lease the property for $1 a year, as well as the $250,000 a year cost of maintaining the field, at 10-year increments for up to 45 years.\n\u201cThat is like FAU [Florida Atlantic University] having a deal with the NFL to have games and programming at their stadium [in Boca Raton],\u201d Schiller said.\nThe USPA won\u2019t have to travel far since the neighboring National Polo Center is already used by the professional polo association. Schiller argued that not having a polo-oriented private club would be a missed opportunity. Discovery Land Company partner Ed Davitas said that the development, designed by New York-Buenos Aires architecture firm Estudio Ramos, would center around learning and watching polo.\nCritics of the project countered that the 24-stall barn would be demolished, only one of the site\u2019s two polo fields would be preserved, and that there were no facilities for horses to stay overnight on site. They also feared that the project could go the way of 23 other polo fields in Wellington and end up being replaced with more residential development should the arrangement between the developers and USPA fall apart. Schiller countered that a covenant would require that any further land use changes would have to be unanimously backed by the council if this deal is approved.\nMcGovern told Schiller that if this vote was for final approval, he would have voted against. He hopes McCourt and Discovery come back with a plan that\u2019s more than just a \u201cpolo field and a country club.\u201d\nOne way to do that was to craft a site plan where there were \u201cfive farms plus homes,\u201d McGovern added.\nA company tied to McCourt paid $52 million for East Isla Carroll in 2022, about a decade after McCourt sold the Dodgers baseball team for $2.2 billion.\nThis wasn\u2019t McCourt\u2019s first transaction in Wellington. He sold a 5.2-acre equestrian property at 13808 Fairlane Court for nearly\n$12 million\nin 2016 and a 9-acre equestrian property for $12 million in Mallet Hill that was a short walk away from Microsoft\nfounder Bill Gates\u2019 assemblage\n. (Gates\u2019 daughter, Jennifer Gates, is an equestrian.)\nDiscover Land Company, a luxury community developer, teamed up with Becker Holding Company to build Atlantic Fields, a 1,500-acre development in\nHobe Sound\nin Martin County with 317 single-family homes and a golf course.\n",

        "content": "Falling mortgage rates will drive activity in the housing market in the coming year, the National Association of Realtors\u2019 top economist said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the Chicago Association of Realtors\u2019 2026 Market Outlook conference, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said\nlower rates\nwill bring more buyers into the market, while the stagnated inventory in Chicagoland will start to loosen up as homeowners\u2019 life circumstances change.\nDays after national brokerage\nCompass closed its bid to buy\nAnywhere Real Estate, its next-biggest competitor, presenters at the conference made no mention of the effect consolidation may have on the industry, or the fight over private listings brewing between\nCompass and Chicago\u2019s local MLS, MRED\n.\nInstead, the conference focused on the macro trends that will drive the housing market over the next year. The 30-year mortgage rate fell below 6 percent this month for the first time since 2023, sparking confidence that consumers will jump into the housing market.\n\u201cAfter three years of seeing 7 percent mortgage rate, 6 percent or even 5.9 percent mortgage rate appears much, much better,\u201d Yun said. \u201cThe consumers\u2019 mindset may be, yeah, this is the time to get into the market.\u201d\nNationally, that will inject some needed juice into a housing market that was essentially flat in 2025, according to NAR\u2019s estimates. Yun said he expects existing home sales to rise by 14 percent nationwide in 2026. NAR does not have forecasts for Chicago specifically, but a December Illinois Realtors study predicted a 5.1 percent increase in\nhome sales in the Chicago metro area\nin 2026.\nChicago\u2019s home prices have risen significantly in recent years, but a combination of high interest rates and low inventory have meant sales volume is down compared to pre-pandemic levels. But those pressures may ease throughout 2026, Yun said.\n\u201cYou are beginning to see more inventory coming onto the market, because even though (homeowners) were sincere to say they love their 3 percent mortgage rates, some have experienced major life-changing events,\u201d Yun said, like having children or retiring. \u201cSo with the passage of time, expect more inventory.\u201d\nThe economy is sending mixed signals, Yun said, but he dismissed concerns about a major housing crash in the coming year. He noted that although the stock market is at record highs and job growth has been solid, defaults on auto and credit card loans are spiking, spelling distress in some sectors.\nStill, mortgage defaults and foreclosures have remained near record lows after spiking in 2020, showing owners are largely not having trouble paying their mortgages.\n\u201cGiven that there\u2019s very little distress among homeowners, don\u2019t expect any kind of price crash,\u201d he said.\nFederal and local policy could also affect home sales this year. President Donald Trump\u2019s direction for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nbuy $200 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities\nlast week sparked a dip in mortgage rates, which may increase buying power and drive up demand. But Yun said policies to increase supply are needed to prevent a spike in prices.\n\u201cWe have to have supply. Without the supply, extra demand just leads to higher prices and more unaffordability,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to ensure that there\u2019s constant supply coming onto the market as we are trying to produce the demand.\u201d\nPolicies that increase supply could include tax credits for development, Yun said, as well as zoning changes to allow for denser housing.\nIllinois Realtors\nis backing state legislation to expand accessory dwelling units and multi-unit housing developments in more cities around the state.\n",

        "content": "Two Dallas real estate firms are teeing up a new hotel development in Uptown.\nCawley Partners and Alamo Manhattan acquired a small office building at 2909 Cole Avenue with plans to replace it with a roughly $50 million hotel. The partners picked up the 27,000-square-foot property with the intent to keep it operating as an office for now before tearing it down, Cawley Partners CEO Bill Cawley\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nThe companies are working with the city on a rezoning for the site, and groundbreaking is targeted for about 18 months from now, pending entitlements. The planned hotel would have about 140 rooms, and\nCawley\ntold the outlet that the group is already in discussions with two or three potential operators.\n\u201cWith the growth in Uptown, we think there\u2019s a shortage of quality, moderately priced hotel rooms,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the market we are going after.\u201d\nDallas Central Appraisal District records show the Cole Avenue building was completed in 1981 and is valued at roughly $3.8 million for tax purposes. The sale price was not disclosed. Cawley said total development costs are expected to come in at $50.1 million.\nThe deal marks another collaboration between Cawley Partners and\nAlamo Manhattan\n. Last year, the firms teamed up to acquire the five-story, 76,000-square-foot office building at 3400 Carlisle Street, built in 1985. Cawley Partners oversees management and leasing at that property.\nAlamo Manhattan has built a\ntrack record\nin Dallas multifamily and hospitality, including the Marriott Dallas hotel on Fairmount Street. President Matt Segrest described the Uptown project as a chance to fill a niche in the local lodging market with a select-service, extended-stay concept aimed at business and longer-term travelers.\nThe hotel plan also lands amid an active stretch for Cawley Partners. The firm recently acquired the nearly 106,000-square-foot Harwood No. 1 office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, formerly known as the old Rolex building. The seller was First United Trust, and while the purchase price was not disclosed, deed records show Cawley Partners secured a $29.5 million loan to finance the deal.\nThe Harwood property, which opened in 1984 and helped kick off the Harwood District, had fallen into foreclosure from developer Harwood International. Cawley said the firm plans to invest about $10 million in upgrades.\nBeyond Uptown,\nCawley Partners\nis also a co-owner of the Shops at Willow Bend in Plano, a retail property that\u2019s been floated as a possible site for a future Dallas Stars arena.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Lurin obtained building permits for improvements at the property, but didn\u2019t complete all of them, the lawsuit claims.\nIn August, the city sent seven code violation notices to Venetos, giving the company until Dec. 15 to resolve the issues. It failed to do so, the city alleges. It\u2019s asking the court to issue an injunction ordering Lurin to fix the property and order that it be sold if Lurin doesn\u2019t correct the\u00a0 code violations.\nThe lawsuit comes as residents of The Sutton, another Lurin-owned apartment complex in Huntsville, face days without running water, the local NBC affiliate\nreported\n. Residents of the property at 190 Shelton Road told the outlet they\u2019ve been using bottled water to bathe and flush their toilets for nearly a week.\nThe city of Huntsville joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords\nsuing Jon Venetos and his firm over unpaid bills\nand poor conditions at Lurin-owned properties.\nIn November, the firm was hit with a temporary restraining order that ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nAcore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits\nin the spring when it said Venetos defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to 12 properties in Florida. Since then,\nFannie Mae sued Venetos and Lurin\nover an alleged $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and\nstill owes $81 million\n.\nVenetos was also\nsued by his Uptown Dallas office landlord, Rosewood Property Group\n, claiming he personally guaranteed the lease he bailed on at Rosewood Court and owes the landlord $5.3 million.\nThe lawsuits by Keybank and Vista include claims of fraud. Keybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere. Former employees have also come out to accuse Lurin of lying on loan reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done.\n",

In one instance, Block reportedly didn\u2019t pay court sanctions on time, while in another, he created a conflict of interest by representing both a tenant and her landlord.\nCharging \u201cnon-refundable\u201d fees would violate bar regulations that such fees must constitute a \u201ctrue retainer,\u201d or money paid to reserve an attorney\u2019s availability for a specific case or period of time, per LAist. Former clients have reportedly claimed poor communication and a lack of availability from Block and his affiliates. Block once reportedly referred to himself as \u201ca man who has\nevicted more tenants\nthan any other human being on the planet Earth,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of the case, we believe the matter will be resolved in Mr. Block\u2019s favor prior to trial at the settlement conference,\u201d Block\u2019s defense attorney, Erin Joyce, said.\nThe California State Bar Court could impose punishments like a brief suspension or an order to complete an ethics exam, or choose to disbar Block entirely. A status conference in court regarding Block\u2019s current charges from the bar is slated for Feb. 9.\nIn another case in 2023, Block\u2019s firm reportedly submitted a filing related to an eviction case that repeatedly\nreferenced fake case law\n, which LAist reported could have been produced through a misuse of\nartificial intelligence\nsoftware. Block\u2019s firm was ordered to pay the tenant\u2019s law firm $999.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s rare wins tied to the real estate community is now under threat.\nA group of North Side residents known as Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development filed a lawsuit against the city this week seeking to reverse\nan upzoning measure passed in October\nthat would allow for more density along a stretch of North Broadway Street.\nIt allows for taller, denser developments and a wider mix of commercial uses along a three-mile section of the corridor from Devon to Montrose avenues in Edgewater and Uptown.\nThe residents\u2019 group alleges in the suit filed in Cook County Circuit Court that the city council passed the zoning measure without properly informing all affected property owners of the ordinance\u2019s impact and that it constituted government overreach.\n\u201cThe Edgewater upzoning was unprecedented both in terms of the distance covered and the sheer number of properties affected,\u201d the complaint states.\nA representative of the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit is the latest escalation in\nlong simmering tension\nover the measure, which has led to delayed votes and prompted the residents\u2019 group to take out a billboard along North Broadway.\n\u201cStuck in traffic? Can\u2019t find parking? 1,000 new residents won\u2019t help! Say no to upzoning,\u201d the sign reads.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses, including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\nProponents of the measure, including many in the real estate industry, celebrated the upzoning as a way to spur much needed housing in\na historic drought of new multifamily construction that is causing spikes in rent\n.\nIt was a much-needed win for the mayor\u2019s administration vis-\u00e0-vis the industry after he came under fire for a proposed\nincrease to the transfer tax\nand the city council\u2019s support for r\night of first refusal measures\non parts of the Northwest and\nSouth sides\n.\nJohnson has, however,\npushed forward similar YIMBY-style measures\nthroughout the city that curried favor with the real estate industry. In July, the city council passed an ordinance eliminating parking minimums for much of the city. And in 2023, he rolled out the\n\u201cCut the Tape\u201d campaign\naimed at reducing wait times for construction permitting.\nStill, Chicago\u2019s individual aldermen and neighborhood leaders wield significant power on the city council.\nOne alderman successfully lobbied to reduce the impact of an ADU ordinance\nlate last year. And the use of\naldermanic privilege\nto determine the fate of proposed developments in any particular ward remains the\nstandard way of doing business\n, despite its\nbias toward NIMBYism as alleged in a HUD investigation\n.",

        "content": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell quietly joined top Chicago Bears officials last weekend to tour potential sites for a new stadium.\nGoodell toured the Bears\u2019 Arlington Heights property along with two sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond, according to a source familiar with the visit and first\nreported\nby the Chicago Tribune. Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chairman George McCaskey led the tour, which took place Saturday \u2014 hours before the team\u2019s dramatic come-from-behind playoff win over the Green Bay Packers.\nThe commissioner\u2019s presence matters. Any new stadium project would need approval from NFL owners, and the league could provide a loan of $200 million or more to help finance construction. Goodell\u2019s site visit signals that the Bears\u2019 plans have moved beyond local posturing into league-level consideration.\nThe Indiana leg of the tour follows reporting last month that the Bears were exploring options across the\nstate line\n. Since then, Indiana Governor Mike Braun has openly courted the team, pitching a new stadium as an economic development win. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic legislative leaders, by contrast, have drawn a firm line against state-funded\nstadium subsidies\n.\nThe Bears have said they would cover more than $2 billion in stadium construction costs themselves, but want public help with roughly $855 million in infrastructure improvements tied to the former Arlington International Racecourse site they own in\nArlington Heights\n. The team is also seeking changes to Illinois law that would allow it to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies.\nThat request has run into resistance from Chicago lawmakers, who argue along with Gov. Pritzker that the Bears should first help address more than $500 million in remaining debt from the 2003 renovation of\nSoldier Field\n, which the city is still paying off. The Bears\u2019 lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, though the team could exit earlier by paying a penalty.\nWarren previously called for breaking ground on a new enclosed, \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d stadium as soon as last year, with a projected three-year buildout.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is firing back against claims that a\nforeclosure auction\ntied to Worldwide Plaza is a rigged attempt from SL Green and RXR to wrest control of the property.\nAn entity tied to Barnett\u2019s Extell Development filed court papers on Monday calling the lawsuit by the rival landlords meritless and accusing the firms of a last-minute scheme to block a UCC sale they\u2019ve known about for months.\nThe legal fight centers on a planned January 15 foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue, the 1.8 million-square-foot Midtown office complex owned by SL Green and RXR. The landlords sued Barnett to stop the UCC sale, arguing that the auction is commercially unreasonable.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the Worldwide Plaza stake.\nBut Extell says SL Green and RXR are rewriting history.\nIn a memorandum filed in New York Supreme Court, the Barnett-backed mezzanine lender argues that SL Green and RXR have been in default for more than a year and were made aware of the foreclosure auction on October 31. Extell argues the lawsuit makes \u201cno legitimate arguments\u201d to stop the UCC sale, per court documents.\nThe filing also rejects claims that Barnett failed to supply proof that he controls the mezzanine loan, saying Extell made the original note available for inspection by the landlords. Extell also clapped back at claims the auction terms are too restrictive, saying they were explicitly negotiated and approved when the loan was originated.\nExtell also argues that SL Green and RXR cannot show irreparable harm, a key requirement for stopping a foreclosure. The landlords themselves have claimed the property\u2019s value has fallen well below the senior debt, Extell points out, meaning there is no equity left to protect, per the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of mezzanine debt in 2017 that was underwritten by Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group. The property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe senior debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\n\u201cOur filing speaks for itself, and we maintain that the lender attempted to interfere with the revitalization of Worldwide Plaza and its tenants. Our formal response will be filed imminently,\u201d said an SL Green spokesperson.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and RXR did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Extell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

The exact address of the building was not disclosed. Ocean Avenue residents spoke out against the neighbors moving in, and city officials imposed fines against Pustilnikov, who leases the buildings. By the following week, the property was cleared out.\nThe empty low-rise buildings at 413 Ocean Avenue, spanning 11,212 square feet, and 825 Ocean Avenue, at 11,256 square feet,\u00a0 have been zoned for use as supportive housing for years, though they are surrounded by upscale condominiums that have sold for as much as $7 million. The buildings were purchased by the Bourne Financial Group in early 2023 for $13 million and are leased by Pustilnikov, who said he aims to earn rental income from them while he seeks change of use permits from the city of Santa Monica.\nThe November dustup was the second time in a span of a few months that Pustilnikov failed to fill the building, as a\nplan to house county behavioral health patients\nat the site last year was also scrapped. Pustilnikov, Bourne Financial Group and St. Joseph Center had approached county mental health officials about using the building, ultimately earning $3.5 million in bridge housing funds to renovate and house homeless residents. The community backlash was swift, and the $3.5 million in funding was canceled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019re not allowed to help people that are struggling in affluent communities,\u201d Pustilnikov told the Times.\nAfter that, Pustilnikov said he was \u201cdone\u201d trying to fill the building until Pacific Coast Healthcare approached him about operating a sober living facility at the site. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, why not?\u2019 It sounded fine. They seem like reputable people,\u201d he told the Times. He leased the property to the company not knowing that the operators hadn\u2019t obtained a business license or move-in approval from the city and were already bussing in residents.\nPustilnikov is now in discussions with the\nLos Angeles County\nDepartment of Mental Health to explore other sites in Santa Monica for housing residents in need of mental healthcare that are closer to existing service providers, county supervisor Lindsey Horvath\u2019s office confirmed to the Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property spans seven buildings, including a 15,000-square-foot amenity building, and is approximately 60 percent leased. The seller\u2019s identity and the building\u2019s addresses were not disclosed.\nThe $600 million purchase grows\nHealthpeak\n\u2019s footprint in South San Francisco to about 6.5 million square feet across 210 acres. The company, previously known as HCP, kicked off the Bay Area biotech construction boom in 2015 with the first phase of South San Francisco\u2019s 800,000-square-foot Cove at Oyster Point development. Since then, millions of square feet of life sciences and biotech space have been built in the Peninsula city.\nAs\nfederal funds for life sciences\nand research have dried up over the past year, firms have shied away from building more office and research space in South San Francisco and beyond. Biotech developer IQHQ is\nlooking to pause development\non 857,000 square feet of its Spur project in South San Francisco, and Forge Development is seemingly\nbacking away from its initial proposal\nfor a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus in Berkeley.\nHealthpeak hasn\u2019t been immune to the downturn. In the last quarter of 2025, the company sold approximately $325 million outpatient medical assets totaling about 834,000 square feet. The firm also said it is negotiating sales for additional outpatient medical facilities as well as recapitalizations and loan repayments that could generate an additional $700 million or more in proceeds.\nVacancy in the Northern Peninsula life sciences market, including South San Francisco, was\nat 39.8 percent\nat the end of the third quarter of last year, per CBRE\u2019s Q3 report. But this year could bring changes, as active tenant requirements increased 73 percent across the Bay Area compared to the previous quarter and 62 percent year-over-year, according to Bisnow.\nSteelWave is among those betting on a comeback, as the firm is\nmoving forward with its plan\nto turn the Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Francisco into a 2.5-million-square-foot, five-building life sciences campus.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lennar Homes officially backed away from a key regulatory step for a large, controversial residential development outside San Antonio, withdrawing an application for a wastewater treatment facility that would have supported the project.\nThe Miami-based builder recently pulled its application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for a permit tied to its proposed Comfort 590 development, according to a filing\nobtained\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The move removes a critical piece of infrastructure for the planned subdivision in Comfort, an unincorporated Kendall County community about 45 miles northwest of downtown\nSan Antonio\n.\nLennar, the nation\u2019s\nsecond-largest homebuilder\n, proposed building roughly 1,100 homes on about 600 acres along Highway 87, with entitlements allowing capacity for another 1,300 units. Because the area lacks centralized sewer service, the project hinged on a standalone wastewater treatment system capable of disposing of up to 600,000 gallons per day.\nThe\ncompany\nformally withdrew the permit application on Dec. 22. Lennar declined to comment on the decision or clarify whether it still intends to pursue the development.\nThe pullback marked a milestone for local opponents. Comfort Neighbors, a grassroots group formed to fight the project, hailed the withdrawal as a major win after more than a year of organizing against what it described as an outsized, high-density development for a town of roughly 3,000 residents.\nThe group includes landowners adjacent to the proposed site, who raised concerns about water availability, wastewater impacts and broader strain on local infrastructure. Members have argued that the development would threaten air and water quality and undermine the area\u2019s rural character, according to the publication. Over the past year, Comfort Neighbors has staged town halls, community meetings and a rally in June to oppose the project.\nThe episode is a familiar tune for Lennar in the region, though not one from which the builder is used to backing down. Two other Lennar developments are grappling with infrastructure limits and increasingly organized local resistance.\nAnother proposed 600,000-gallon wastewater permit is under review for the builder\u2019s proposed 850-home Broken Cedar Ranch in Comal County, north of San Antonio, that would pump treated wastewater into nearby Canyon Lake. TCEQ scheduled a\npublic meeting\nto address the development for Feb. 10 at Canyon Lake High School.\nA proposed 2,900-home development,\nGuajolote Ranch\n, northwest of San Antonio near the suburb of Helotes did receive a wastewater permit, despite local opposition. It allows discharge of up to 1 million gallons daily into Helotes Creek, a tributary that feeds the Edwards Aquifer, which is a drinking water source for more than 2.5 million people across 13 counties, according to the Edwards Aquifer Authority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s highest court on Tuesday upheld the city\u2019s ability to charge owners a fee when converting apartments reserved for artists, reversing a lower court\u2019s ruling that the practice was unconstitutional.\nThe New York Court of Appeals, in a 6-1\ndecision\n, found that a state Appellate Court wrongfully\nconcluded\nthat a portion of the 2021 Soho and Noho rezoning violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s takings clause.\nAs part of the rezoning, new rules were applied to so-called Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists, which are reserved for artists certified by the city. Owners of such units must pay $100 per square foot to an arts fund run by the city before receiving approval from City Planning to convert the apartments for other use.\nCritics of the fee argued that it stood in the way of owners bringing their properties into compliance with the law. The state\u2019s multiple dwelling law was\namended\nin 2022 to allow non-artists who lived in JLWQA units on or before the rezoning was approved to continue to inhabit the apartments legally. But if a non-artist tries to buy such a property, they would need to convert the artist units before legally occupying them or renting them out to non-artist tenants.\nThe Coalition for Fairness in Soho and Noho, a group representing owners and residents of the neighborhoods, filed a lawsuit in February 2022, seeking to annul the rezoning, which allowed more residential and commercial use within a 50-block area.\nWhen a state Supreme Court sided with the city, the coalition appealed, but focused on the artists\u2019 fee rather than the entire rezoning. A panel of Appellate Division judges\nreversed\nthe lower court\u2019s decision in December 2024, finding the fee to be unconstitutional and without any legitimate land-use rationale.\nBut the Court of Appeals found that hitting a property owner with a standalone fee doesn\u2019t invoke the takings clause. Such a \u201cmonetary exaction\u201d must be in lieu of a transfer of a private property interest to qualify as a violation of the clause.\n\u201cPetitioners may desire a property interest in a more valuable and less restrictive form, and they may want it without strings attached, but the opportunity to relinquish one form of property to acquire another, in exchange for a monetary payment to an arts fund, is not a taking,\u201d Judge Jenny Rivera wrote.\nAttorneys for the coalition, along with Judge Michael Garcia, the lone dissenting opinion, argue that the fact that the government is making a monetary demand tied to a specific property interest as a condition of receiving permits is enough to constitute an illegal taking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false distinction between real property and money that the court drew,\u201d said Chris Kieser, an attorney for the coalition.\nHe said his clients are considering whether to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.\nThe city legalized JLWQAs in the manufacturing districts of Soho in the 1970s. As the area transformed, turning into a sought-after residential neighborhood, technically illegal ground-floor retail and residential lofts sprouted up as the number of certified artists in the city declined. As of 2022, only 36 of the city\u2019s 1,636 JLWQA units were occupied by certified artists, and the city had certified fewer than 100 artists in the preceding decade.\nThe city rarely enforced the artist units\u2019 residency requirements, and the Adams administration stopped efforts to increase penalties for violations.\nKieser said the city is holding conversions of these units hostage, even as it wants to end the program (new JLWQA units can\u2019t be created) and make way for affordable housing. The Soho and Noho rezoning was supposed to pave the way for more than 3,000 units of housing over the next decade, though\nprogress\nhas been slow.\nA spokesperson for the city\u2019s Law Department said he was pleased by the decision.\n",

        "content": "Some years ago, the Woodland Hills Country Club in Los Angeles County sold its 94-acre golf course.\nToday, hundreds of local residents are flocking to meetings and rallies to stop a\n398-home project\non 20 acres of that land.\nOne of the opponents was a member of the club when it decided to sell. \u201cWe needed the money,\u201d he told another person at one opposition meeting. But the buyer was a developer, Arrimus Capital of Newport Beach, so the proposal could not have been a surprise.\nWhat was a surprise \u2014 at least to the furious locals \u2014 is that the project apparently does not need the usual public hearings, environmental reviews and political approval that have made Los Angeles one of the tightest and most expensive housing markets in the nation. For this very reason, the fast track was created in the past four years by state legislation (\nAB2011 and AB2243\n).\nNIMBY fights are usually about size and affordability, but these issues mean very different things in different places, as the Woodland Hills fight shows.\nIn New York City, rezonings tend to be for multifamily buildings in progressive neighborhoods, where opponents demand shorter buildings and more affordability.\nIn suburban areas, opponents tend to be single-family homeowners who want projects to have fewer units and less affordability, because they fear traffic and poor people.\nThe Woodland Hills project will have 97 affordable apartments, most of them for seniors. Another 175 homes will be single-family and 126 will be apartments. It adds up to 76 percent market-rate and 24 percent affordable, which in Crown Heights would have people screaming \u201cgentrification!\u201d\nThe NIMBYs of Woodland Hills \u2014 a community of\n80,000 people\n\u2014 are mostly aghast at the idea of having about 800 new neighbors. This 1 percent population increase, they say, would cause gridlock in the event of a fire disaster like the one they witnessed from their cul-de-sacs last winter.\nI am not persuaded. If there\u2019s gridlock during a fire, 99 percent of it would be caused by the current residents. If the situation were as dangerous as they claim, they would be moving out en masse, or the government would be condemning their homes. That isn\u2019t happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s proposals to address rising insurance costs for multifamily housing amount to anything? What about her promise to reform J-51? See pages 32 to 35 of her\nState of the State Book\nand send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: If you have a New York building with\nlarge refrigeration equipment\n, you must report its leakage rate to the state Department of Environmental Conservation in March or face a fine of up to $2,500 plus $500 per day after that. The deadline for medium-sized equipment is June. The idea is to curb leaks that contribute to climate change.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRent control, a poster child among economists for the wrong way to address housing affordability, could be returning to Massachusetts \u2014 not because socialists have taken over the legislature, but because a proposal appears destined for the statewide ballot in November.\nOne poll found 63 percent of voters would support and only 31 percent would oppose the proposal, which would cap rent increases at 5 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.\nHousing guru Jay Parsons is raising alarms.\n\u201cMassachusetts voters banned rent control in the 1990s due to numerous unintended consequences. Studies by MIT and Harvard later showed the REMOVAL of rent caps led to reduced crime, improved building maintenance and improved property values,\u201d he\nposted on LinkedIn\n.\n\u201cBut this is a new generation of voters \u2014 few of whom likely remember the reasons they banned rent control three decades ago.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$8.15 million\nfor a 4,440-square-foot townhouse at 409 Sackett Street in Carroll Gardens. Ellen Gottleib and Neely Johnson with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$141 million\nfor the 283,465-square-foot, 19-story office building at 3 East 54th Street in Sutton Place. Cohen Brothers Realty sold the property to Vornado.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 416 West 51st Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Clara Chung with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Under the ordinance, transactions for properties between $5.3 million and $10.6 million incur an additional 4 percent tax, and deals for $10.6 million or more trigger a 5.5 percent tax. City officials have long said that money earned from the transfer tax will go toward funding affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.\nAs of Jan. 8, Measure ULA has generated more than $1 billion from 1,435 transactions, according to Los Angeles Housing Department data cited by CO. Of those deals, 60 percent were for single-family residences, 24 percent were for nonresidential commercial properties and 13 percent were for multifamily sales. The ZIP codes of 90049, 90272 and 90077, encompassing top-tier Los Angeles neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Bel Air and\nPacific Palisades\n, accounted for the largest share of sales producing ULA funds.\nThe amount of money coming in from ULA, implemented April 1, 2023, is growing with each fiscal year. Over the past six months, the ordinance collected $306.7 million, meaning it will likely surpass the previous year\u2019s $413.2 million before the end of the fiscal year in June. The resulting cash on hand has led to the largest\nnotice of funding availability, or NOFA\n, in Los Angeles Housing Department history.\nNearly 74 percent of ULA funds in fiscal year 2025-26 are allocated for\naffordable housing\nprograms, such as multifamily development, preserving property affordability and a homeownership opportunities initiative prioritizing first-time buyers and local land trusts. The rest of the money is set aside for homelessness prevention programs, including short-term emergency assistance, eviction defense, and income support for seniors and persons with disabilities.\nCommercial real estate executives have been outspoken in\ntheir opposition\nto ULA, with some choosing to\ninvest outside of Los Angeles\ncity limits entirely. Universe Holdings decided to pause or cancel transactions in L.A. due to the tax, selling several properties in early 2023 before ULA went into effect, and the company hadn\u2019t bought or sold any as of last spring, according to CO.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\npanel in September. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nuveen has taken ownership of the 35-story office tower at\n321 North Clark Street\n, marking the latest slipup in a series of mezzanine loan gambles that have shifted from passive investments into losses or active ownership for the asset manager.\nChicago-based Nuveen, in partnership with Los Angeles-based\nPacific Coast Capital Partners (PCCP)\nthrough a co-managed fund, completed a takeover of the 897,000-square-foot River North property. The transaction wiped out the equity of the previous ownership venture \u2014 consisting of Larry Levy\u2019s Chicago-based Diversified Real Estate Capital, Houston-based Hines and Los Angeles-based American Realty Advisors.\nThe deal underscores the ongoing distress in the office market and risks associated with mezzanine debt positions taken before interest rates jumped in 2022. Nuveen provided a\n$296 million in floating rate loan for the property in 2021\n, then sold off a $222 million first mortgage portion of the debt to a consortium of German banks, while keeping an approximately $74 million mezzanine position, according to public records and people familiar with the property\u2019s financing.\nNow, Nuveen\u2019s mezzanine position has been converted into an ownership interest, according to a spokesperson for the firm, which is the real estate investment arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the pooled asset manager for educator retirement accounts. It\u2019s unclear how much cash PCCP brought to the table to enter the deal, as Nuveen declined to answer detailed questions about the size of their respective stakes in the property.\nDiversified, PCCP, Hines and American Realty Advisors didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nFor Nuveen, 321 North Clark adds to a\nseries of office troubles\nwhere mezzanine loans it originated to Chicago office landlords didn\u2019t go as planned, wiping out investments, or, in this case, requiring a pivot to hands-on ownership. Mezzanine loans Nuveen funded have sunk with borrowers such as\nBlackstone at 350 North Orleans Street\n, which is currently facing foreclosure, as well as\nSterling Bay at 600 West Chicago Avenue\n, which sold for just $89 million last year after fetching $510 million in 2018.\nDespite the circumstances of the takeover, Nuveen is signaling aggressive moves to stabilize the asset. The firm announced that it hired Telos Group as the new leasing agent for the 936,000-square-foot tower, replacing Hines in that capacity. Hines will, however, retain its role as property manager.\nNuveen emphasized that the property is \u201copen for business\u201d and well-capitalized to compete for tenants in a fierce leasing market.\n\u201cWe have capital available to invest in tenant improvements, leasing incentives and property enhancements \u2014 sending a strong signal to the leasing community that 321 North Clark has stable, well-capitalized ownership dedicated to creating a best-in-class tenant experience,\u201d a Nuveen spokesperson said.\nThe firm\u2019s venture with PCCP plans to deploy additional equity capital to modernize the building, including upgrades to the conference center and tenant lounge areas.\nNuveen declined to disclose specific occupancy figures but reaffirmed its confidence in the property\u2019s long-term value. CBRE, the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate brokerage, was previously one of the building\u2019s prominent tenants until it left the property to\nmove into 300 North LaSalle Street\nin recent months.\n",

        "content": "A small, distressed River North office building is headed for a residential reset, as a local developer leans into Chicago\u2019s growing wave of modest office-to-apartment conversions.\nChicago-based Monroe Residential Partners paid $5.4 million for the four-story, 48,000-square-foot loft-style office building at 401 West Ontario Street, with plans to convert the property into 57 apartments, firm founder Drew Friestedt told Crain\u2019s, which first\nreported\nthe sale. The sale adds another bite-sized project to downtown\u2019s conversion pipeline, where underused offices are increasingly giving way to housing.\nThe building, which is roughly half leased, became financially untenable as offices, Friestedt said. It was also the subject of a foreclosure suit filed in 2024.\n\u201cThe revenue from rent is barely enough to cover your real estate taxes,\u201d\nFriestedt\ntold the outlet. \u201cThe common theme is they don\u2019t work as office buildings anymore, and they\u2019re selling to people who can try to make the building work as residential.\u201d\nMonroe is budgeting about $20 million all-in for the project, including the acquisition, and is currently lining up construction financing. The firm aims to break ground in October and complete the conversion roughly a year later.\nPlans call for a mix of compact one-bedroom units of about 450 square feet, with starting rents of about $2,300 a month, alongside larger two-bedroom, duplex-style apartments measuring roughly 1,200 square feet and renting for as much as $3,800. The pricing reflects continued strength in downtown apartment demand, even as new supply remains muted.\nThe project will require zoning relief. While the site\u2019s DX-7 zoning allows residential use above the ground floor, Monroe plans to add ground-floor units, triggering the need for approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals.\nMonroe Residential Partners has built a portfolio of mixed-use and residential projects, including developments at 851 West Grand Avenue and 1313 West Randolph Street.\nGreenstone Partners broker Jordan Multack represented Monroe in the latest deal, while Frontline Real Estate Partners served as receiver and marketed the property.\nThe seller was a venture led by Chicago investor Sean Conlon, who bought the building for $6.6 million in 2015. After being hit with a\nforeclosure suit\ntied to a 2017 mortgage, the property was marketed through a receivership sale.\nConlon\ntold the publication that he ultimately sold the building in full satisfaction of the loan after it failed to make \u201ceconomic sense\u201d amid high property taxes.\nThe deal comes as Chicago\u2019s broader development pipeline\nremains thin\n. Just three large-scale downtown projects totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Solano County exurb of\nVacaville\n, once an escape from the expensive rents and home prices of San Francisco and other cities closer to the Bay, is now becoming another housing crisis hotspot.\nIn Vacaville, considered an exurb because it is a growing residential area located beyond the suburbs, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment\nhas more than doubled\nsince 2010 to approximately $2,500 from about $1,200, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nAcross Solano County, the cities of Vacaville and Vallejo now have the Bay Area\u2019s greatest share of\ncost-burdened renters\n. More than 70 percent of renters in both cities spend at least 30 percent of their pre-tax income on housing, far above the regional average of 56 percent of renters and national levels hovering at around 50 percent, the Chronicle reported, citing U.S. Census Bureau data. Over the past five years, Vacaville\u2019s percentage of cost-burdened renters has increased faster than any other Bay Area city.\nThe hike in rents in Vacaville comes despite a building blitz in the city. Between 2015 and 2021, developers completed about 2,900 residential units in the city, more than double its state housing target and enough to make it one of the Bay Area\u2019s top housing producers by raw volume.\nThe issue is with the type of housing that is being built \u2014 mostly higher-end single-family homes.\nMultifamily housing\n, including townhomes and small apartment buildings, comprises less than 10 percent of Vacaville\u2019s housing stock.\nCash buyers relocating from pricier Bay Area markets bid up home prices as renters face limited supply and rising rents. The city of Vacaville is also facing projected budget deficits of about $9 million and a hiring freeze for local government.\nWith a dearth of multifamily and below-market-rate housing, younger workers might not be able to make ends meet in the Solano County city.\n\u201cThese outlying cities really are the next frontier of displacement,\u201d Cristal Gallegos, director of community-led nonprofit Vallejo Housing Justice Coalition, told the Chronicle. \u201cOnce the old adage of \u2018\ndrive until you qualify\n[for a mortgage]\u2019 stops applying to the Bay Area, you know you have a serious problem.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Most of the regional declines are shallow, but in Denton County, one of the state\u2019s hottest home development hubs, prices fell more steeply.\nIn Fort Worth proper, the 2025 median sale price was $330,000, down 1.5 percent from the year prior. Tarrant County overall was practically unchanged, with a price decline of 0.3 percent at $349,000. Johnson County to the south and Parker County to the west experienced declines of 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.\n\u201cI would call that, in my professional opinion, a flat market,\u201d said Jim Fite, CEO of Century 21 Judge Fite, a leading North Texas brokerage. \u201cIf I\u2019m a seller, an owner, my equity is not being withered away. And as a buyer, I can\u2019t just go out and steal a house now.\u201d\nDenton County, which straddles Fort Worth and Dallas to the north, is a notable outlier.\nDenton County experienced a 4.3 percent decline in home prices from 2024 to 2025, falling to a median of $445,000. In December alone, prices fell almost 10 percent, year-over-year.\nWhile sales and prices tend to move in tandem, they diverged in Denton County last year, with the number of closed sales rising by a steady 2.2 percent in December while prices fell, according to the MetroTex Association of Realtors.\nHomebuilding may play a part in the trend. Developers have been blitzing north from Dallas for years, with\nactivity especially concentrated along the Dallas North Tollway\n, but also spreading laterally.\nCelina\n, which Denton County partially includes, is\none of the hottest residential markets in the state\n. Pilot Point, wholly contained in Denton County,\nboomed\nduring the pandemic and\ncontinues to attract developers\u2019 interest\n. Denton itself has drawn billions in investment, including a\nPerot family project\nthat will deliver 6,000 single-family homes and 3,000 apartments.\nOther upcoming single-family projects include the\nCole Ranch\nand the\nAlpha Ranch\n, both set to have over 4,000 homes apiece, and the\nFurst Ranch\n, expected to have 1,300 homes. Multifamily development in the pipeline includes\nChadwick Farms\n, a mixed-use project with 900 apartments and a hotel, and\nThe Renegade\n, a Holt Lunsford Commercial project in downtown Denton.\n",

Rounding out the year at negative 311,369 square feet, it far exceeded negative 4 million square feet from 2021, and has steadily increased since then. The fourth quarter recorded a negative absorption of 439,859 square feet, breaking the market\u2019s two-quarter stretch of positive absorption.\nVacancies, while still elevated, have decreased to 26.3 percent after peaking at nearly 27 percent in 2024. But, like Dallas, return to work mandates and a narrowing development pipeline have helped the Houston office market perk up.\nSubmarkets on top\nOf the city\u2019s office submarkets, the Galleria performed best in the fourth quarter, JLL reported.\nThe Galleria logged nearly 200,000 square feet of positive absorption, thanks to Texas Dow Employees Credit Union\u2019s move to 121,000 square feet at the building at 2000 Post Oak Boulevard and Camden Property Trust\u2019s relocation to 104,000 square feet at the building at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard.\nThe Galleria also came in second in terms of annual net absorption, recording nearly 341,000 square feet of positive office space absorption. The suburbs closest to Houston topped the list with more than 555,000 square feet of absorption for the year. Katy Freeway West, the western part of I-10 stretching from Houston to Katy, came in third on the list. It logged 215,000 square feet of positive absorption by the end of the year.\nThe Galleria\u2019s high absorption rate marks a win for the submarket that had an elevated vacancy rate of 32 percent at the end of 2025. The retail hotspot has about 22.5 million square feet of office space.\nThe submarket could expect a boost after being selected for one of the city\u2019s coveted branded condo projects.\nDeiso Moss\nannounced plans to develop a 44-story hotel and condo tower at 2120 Post Oak Boulevard, as the city races to level up its branded condo offerings.\nOffice trades\nOffice building sales inched up in 2025, compared to 2024, to 9.7 million square feet \u2014 a slight edge over 2024\u2019s 9.5 million square feet.\nLast year, Houston office operators made lemonade out of the city\u2019s glut of old office space. Of the\ntop 10 largest office trades\n, at least five were distress-related sales, including the\nbiggest office sale of 2025\n, in which Houston\u2019s largest office complex, Houston Center returned to its lender, AustralianSuper.\nTwo of the top sales involved buildings eyed for conversion. Chicago-based 3L Real Estate plans to convert\nOne City Center\n, at 1021 Main Street, into 93 corporate suites for visiting employees and 460 traditional apartments.\nThe market\u2019s low valuations and excess of old space made way for\nowner-occupiers\nto enter the market. These buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the Houston office market in 2025, Partners Real Estate reported..\nThe closest thing to a trophy office trade on the list was the sale of Energy Center I, an Energy Corridor office building at 585 North Dairy Ashford that was built in 2008 and renovated in 2020.\nExperts predict trophy trades will ratchet up this year.\n\u201cAs high quality space and stable ownership increasingly drive tenant decisions, competition for premium properties is expected to intensify throughout 2026,\u201d JLL\u2019s\u2019 report said.\n",

        "content": "Kolter Urban has closed $425.3 million in condo deals at its newly completed Selene Oceanfront Residences in Fort Lauderdale.\nThe developer finished the two-tower, 26-story, 194-unit condominium at 151 North Seabreeze Boulevard late last year and began closings in October, according to property records. So far, 168 deeds have recorded, totaling $425.3 million in sales.\nLed by Bob Vail, Kolter Urban is the condo development division of Bobby Julien\u2019s Delray Beach-based Kolter Group.\nThe project is just shy of a decade in the making.\nKolter started acquiring the 2.6-acre site for the project in 2017, spending $34.4 million across several purchases. Kolter\nlaunched sales\nfor the towers in 2021 and secured\na $240 million construction loan\nfrom Wells Fargo in 2022. Designed by Kobi Karp Architects and interiors firm ID &amp; Design International, the project was initially slated to finish in 2024.\nSelene\u2019s units range from two- to four-bedrooms that span between 2,300 and 5,300 square feet, according to a news release. The towers also have a few larger penthouse units. Amenities in the buildings include two pools, a fitness center, a business center, a theater, a gaming lounge and\nprivate dining space\n.\nThe most expensive closing in the towers so far was Beau Aero and Alfredo Martin\u2019s $12.2 million purchase of the 5,300-square-foot unit S2701, records show. That sale amounted to $2,300 per square foot. Beau Aero Martin founded a workwear company based in Columbia, Missouri.\nM. Michele Burns, the former CEO of Mercer and a member of the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors, bought unit S2702 for $10.7 million, according to property records.\nTwenty-two units remain to be sold, priced between $2.7 million and $11.7 million, a spokesperson confirmed.\nSelene is one of the latest completed projects in\na packed pipeline of Broward County residential developments\n.\nLong passed over by developers for the glitzier markets in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County, as the region has boomed post-pandemic, developers have\nturned their gaze to Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach\n. At least two dozen projects totaling more than 3,900 units are in the works, led by some of South Florida\u2019s biggest names: Jorge P\u00e9rez, Edgardo Defortuna, Isaac Toledano and Miki Naftali, among others.\nJulien is onto the next one in another market, though. Earlier this month, Kolter and Perko Development Partners launched sales for their planned\nMaison d\u2019Or\ncondos in West Palm Beach, with prices starting at $5.7 million.",

        "content": "Crescent Real Estate closed its latest investment fund, pulling in $241.5 million for commercial real estate moves, as fundraising across private equity remains under pressure.\nThe Fort Worth-based firm wrapped up what it called \u201cGP Invitation Fund IV\u201d on Dec. 31, falling shy of its $250 million target, according to federal filings. The raise marks Crescent\u2019s fourth invitation fund and comes three years after the company collected $265 million for Fund III in 2022 through a similarly invitation-only process, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe closing offers a snapshot of a tougher capital raising climate. Global private equity fundraising slid for a third straight year in 2025, dropping 12.7 percent to $480.3 billion from $551.2 billion in 2024, according to S&amp;P Global. Fewer funds came to market as well, a slowdown that cut across buyout, growth and diversified strategies.\nChristopher Goff\n, senior managing director and head of capital formation at Crescent, described 2025 as an \u201cadjustment year\u201d after the easy money era that followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s pandemic-era rate cuts. Inflation and higher borrowing costs have since reset expectations.\nEven so, Crescent wasted little time\ndeploying capital\n. Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 told the outlet that about 15 percent to 20 percent of Fund IV has already been committed, including multiple Uptown Dallas office deals that closed late last year. Those included the 19-story building at\n2100 McKinney\n, anchored by CBRE, and the\nTexas Capital Center\nat 2000 McKinney Avenue, which several market sources pegged as the largest office sale in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nThe fund\u2019s flexible mandate allows Crescent to invest across office, residential and hotel projects, rather than locking into a single property type. Lately, trophy offices have emerged as the firm\u2019s highest conviction play, even as many institutional investors remain wary of the sector, according to Goff.\nCrescent was founded in 1987 by John Goff and the late Richard Rainwater and reported $4.3 billion in assets under management at the end of 2024. Across all strategies, the company controls more than $16 billion of real estate, including 67 million square feet of offices, 10,100 apartments and 9,300 hotel keys, according to its website.\nIn North Texas, Crescent continues to double down on Uptown, where it owns the iconic Crescent complex, reacquired in 2021, and is advancing construction on the second office building at its Crescent Fort Worth development, anchored by JPMorgan Chase.\nWhile the firm has expressed interest in seeing Dallas thrive broadly \u2014 including Downtown, which faces fresh headwinds after AT&amp;T\u2019s announced exit \u2014 Crescent\u2019s strategy remains tightly focused.\n\u201cWe want to be super disciplined,\u201d Goff said. \u201cWhere do we feel like we have a comparative advantage? And where do our investors feel like we can operate better than anybody else?\u201d\nFor now, that answer points squarely to Uptown Dallas \u2014 and to offices \u2014 even as much of the market stays on the sidelines.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The move comes months after ownership defaulted on the debt at the outdoor shopping center, stretching from West 97th to West 100th Street on Columbus Avenue.\nChetrit and Stellar began missing monthly $1.9 million debt payments in August, according to the lawsuit. Chetrit vowed to make good on the back payments and resume monthly payments after receiving a\ndefault notice in October\n, but failed to actually do so, according to the suit, leading to another default notice this month.\nOwnership allegedly owes $370 million, including more than $7 million in interest and late charges.\nLaw firms for the defendants either declined to comment or did not respond to the publication\u2019s request. No legal response has been filed either.\nThe 270,000-square-foot shopping center is anchored by Whole Foods and Target. The debt has been in special servicing at least twice, including once in late 2023 due to tenant distress from the pandemic, leading to a three-year extension on the mortgage.\nThe shopping center is separate from a five-building, 710-unit multifamily portfolio that sits above the retail portion of the complex. In August, UDR, the Colorado-based multifamily real estate investment trust, and its partner MetLife began exploring a sale of the rental portion of the property for\nup to $500 million\n.\nFour of the five buildings are free market; the fifth is subject to an older 421a agreement under which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting their legal rent limits.\nUDR teamed up with MetLife in 2012 to buy the portfolio from the late Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar and the Chetrit Organization for\n$635 million\n.\n",

Their footprint ballooned during the pandemic-era population surge, as institutional capital chased fast-growing Sun Belt markets.\nBy some estimates, corporate investors now own between 20 and 25 percent of Florida\u2019s single-family rental homes.\nThat buying spree has fueled backlash from would-be homeowners and\npoliticians\n, who argue that deep-pocketed landlords are crowding them out and shrinking an already tight supply of homes for sale.\nTrump has offered few details on how a ban would work, in statements that marked his first major foray into the housing affordability debate. He is expected to outline the proposal more fully at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland later this month.\nFlorida has been a cash cow for large-scale rental operators.\nInvitation Homes\n, the nation\u2019s largest single-family rental landlord and a former Blackstone unit, generated $556 million in revenue from Florida properties in the first nine months of last year, according to financial filings. The company manages nearly 27,000 homes statewide, with a portfolio valued at $4.2 billion.\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent\nowns almost 8,700 single-family properties in Florida worth roughly $2.1 billion.

        "content": "A Burr Ridge mansion that former Bulls center Eddy Curry once lost through foreclosure sold on Tuesday for $4 million, the most expensive sale in the western Chicago suburb in more than a year.\nThe sprawling home at 6655 Lee Court has seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms and covers 14,600 square feet. Built in 2006, it sits on a one-acre lot on an exclusive cul-de-sac, next door to the house owned by late rapper Juice WRLD\u2019s mother,\nCarmela Wallace\n.\nThe home went on the market in June last year asking nearly $5 million. The price dropped to $4.5 million in September, and it went under contract in November. The sale price is over $2 million less than what Curry paid for the house in 2006.\nRafael Murillo, the Compass agent who represented the buyers, confirmed the sale and said his clients bought the house because it offered a secluded, exclusive location while still being near downtown Chicago.\nThe suburb\nis a little over 20 miles from downtown.\n\u201cThe amount of land here is something you simply won\u2019t find in nearby communities like Hinsdale or other close-in suburbs, where lots are far more limited,\u201d Murillo said.\nHe declined to name the buyers, but said they plan to make renovations to the home, including adding an outdoor kitchen and a pool. Public records that could reveal the identity of the buyers aren\u2019t yet recorded in Cook County.\n\u201cBuilding a home of this caliber from the ground up today would likely cost double the list price \u2014 or more \u2014 purely in construction costs,\u201d Murillo said.\nGinny Stewart and Paige Kelly of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the sellers. Stewart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe home features an attached \u201ctownhome-like suite,\u201d according to listing information, with a separate entrance and its own kitchen, laundry and bedrooms. The primary suite covers 1,800 square feet and includes a fireplace, sitting area and two walk in closets.\nCurry bought the house in 2006 for $6.1 million. At the time, he was playing for the New York Knicks after four years with the Bulls. In 2007, Curry\u2019s lender, Morgan Stanley Credit Corp, moved to foreclose on the house. The proceedings lasted until 2014, when Curry handed the house over to a loan servicing agency.\nIn 2007, Curry and his family were robbed at gunpoint in the house, according to reporting from the time. The offenders were also later charged in connection to a robbery of then-Miami Heat player Antoine Walker that same year.\nOral surgeon Louis Korompilas bought the house out of foreclosure for a discounted $3.1 million in 2014, according to property records. He transferred the property to family members in 2020, but it was transferred back to a trust under his name shortly before it went up for sale last year, property records show.\nThe owners paid $45,500 in property taxes in 2024, records show.\nThe $4 million price tag makes it the most expensive house to sell in Burr Ridge since July 2024, when a home on Cabernet Court brought in $5 million, listing services show. Wallace\npaid $6.9 million\nfor her Lee Court home in 2022 \u2014 along with $1.4 million for an adjacent parcel \u2014 setting the record for a home sale price in Burr Ridge, according to listing services. She\nlisted the home for sale\nin a private network in September, asking $7.2 million.\nTwo other homes in Burr Ridge are asking more than $4 million. A 13,900-square-foot estate with a stone facade and terracotta roof hit the market in July and is now asking $5.7 million. A 9,300-square-foot \u201cgentleman\u2019s farm\u201d with grandfathered horse rights on 7.6 acres is\nasking $10 million\n, which would mark a record for the suburb if it fetches that price.\nThe $1 million drop from the Lee Court home\u2019s initial asking price could be a sign those homes will need to cut their ask to find buyers. But Murillo said Tuesday\u2019s sale bodes well for those other properties, showing a sign that buyers are interested and inventory is dwindling.\n\u201cWith confidence in the luxury market and so few options available, it\u2019s really only a matter of time before those homes go under contract,\u201d he said.\n",

Lampi had been with the company since 2001 and held the position of Inland Investments CEO for nearly two years.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Lampi left the company, although SEC filings indicate his resignation was \u201cnot due to any disagreement with the company, its advisor or any of its and their affiliates,\u201d the filing read.\nDuring Lampi\u2019s tenure, Inland Real Estate Group restructured much of its executive ranks to consolidate operations among Inland Private Capital Corporation (the company\u2019s tax-deferred investment arm), Inland Venture Partners (the company\u2019s private equity arm), and Inland Securities Corporation (the company\u2019s dealer manager for Inland investment vehicles). The effort was part of Lampi\u2019s long-term vision for the company, a prior press release stated.\nLampi had taken over the Inland Investments CEO position from Mitchell Sabshon\n, a longtime Inland executive who retired in early 2024. Around the same time, Inland Real Estate Group co-founder and CEO\nDaniel Goodwin\ndied and was succeeded by Chesero.\nA month prior to that, co-founder and CEO of Inland\u2019s acquisitions arm,\nJoseph Cosenza\n, died as well. He was succeeded by his son Mark Cosenza and longtime Inland executive Matthew Tice.\nThe Inland family of companies is one of the country\u2019s largest real estate investment firms with $125 billion in transactions since its founding in 1968. It currently employs over 1,200 people and operates in 49 states, according to its website.\nNew York-based DRA Advisors acquired a huge Inland business line in 2016, when it assumed the firm\u2019s 132-property, $2.3 billion real estate portfolio concentrated on Midwest shopping centers, which operated under the IRC Retail Centers banner.\nDRA\nover the last few years has shed a notable portion of the Midwest portfolio\n, worth an estimated $540 million.",

        "content": "The day before Christmas Eve, Meyer Chetrit\u2019s interests in two holding companies were quietly auctioned off.\nThe highest bidder was an entity of\naggressive lender Maverick Real Estate Partners\n. The affiliate had foreclosed on Chetrit, won a $132 million judgment, and had set about getting paid by garnishing and auctioning Chetrit\u2019s assets.\nThe result is the latest in Chetrit\u2019s ongoing financial decline and legal battles and reveals the playbook of Maverick, which seemingly aims to take Chetrit\u2019s interests for itself on the cheap, under the auspices of an auction.\nThe Christmas week auction is the second in the ongoing legal saga between Maverick and Chetrit. At the\nfirst auction,\na representative for Maverick traded bids with Meyer Chetrit\u2019s brother Juda, who co-heads the Chetrit Organization.\nBut the second time around, it appears there were no bids traded because no one showed up. Court memos and affirmations from both Maverick\u2019s counsel and the city marshal responsible for the auction detailed the participants and spectators at the first auction, but their documents refer to no attendees, other than Maverick\u2019s affiliate, at the second.\nAt its own auction, Maverick bought Chetrit\u2019s interest in an LLC called CF Jamaica. The entity, through a series of other companies, controls a 16-story residential building at 152-01 and 150-13 88th Avenue in Jamaica.\nThe property is worth about $150 million but tied to about $285 million in debt, according to court documents filed by Chetrit\u2019s legal team. Chetrit allegedly received no income\nThe other entity Maverick won was called 90-100 Trinity Holder. The company is likely linked to the Chetrits\u2019 90 and 100 Trinity Place in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, two 10- and 15-story buildings. It\u2019s unclear the level of control or interest Meyer Chetrit personally has in the property.\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that these auctions should see few attendees. The auctions are little advertised. The city marshal\u2019s handbook requires that public auctions be advertised the day-of in a newspaper. There are no requirements that auctions be marketed online.\nAnd they are scheduled seemingly on the fly. Six days before the auction, a spokesperson for Fox Rothschild, the law firm representing Maverick and the host of the first auction, said no date had been set yet for another. The Department of Investigation, which oversees the city marshals, similarly said days before that it was unaware of any scheduled auctions in the case.\nMarshal Martin Bienstock, the city marshal hired by Maverick to run the ostensibly public auction, declined to answer questions about the value of the winning bid or whether anyone besides Maverick participated in the auction. Neither Maverick nor Matthew Schenker, a lawyer for the affiliate with Fox Rothschild, responded to a request for comment.\nChetrit had made a legal attempt to stop the auctions but had been turned down by a judge.\n",

        "content": "The owner of a long-struggling shopping center in Chicago\u2019s Clybourn Corridor is preparing to kick off a redevelopment that could eventually bring a sizable residential building to one of the North Side\u2019s busiest retail strips.\nDeerfield-based CRM Properties plans to begin demolition in the coming months at\nClybourn Place\n, a 3-acre shopping center at 1800 North Clybourn Avenue, CoStar\nreported\n. The initial phase would clear portions of the site to make way for roughly 43,900 square feet of new retail space, revamped parking and open areas designed to host community events.\nThe move follows a rough stretch for the center, which has lost several high-profile tenants in recent years, including the original\nGoose Island Beer\nbrewpub\n, Patagonia and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nCRM\nfirst outlined its broader vision for the property \u2014 dubbed the Willow Street District \u2014 in May 2024.\nAt the time, the firm said the site could ultimately support an apartment building of up to 500 units on the southwest corner of the property. That housing component remains conceptual. CRM principal Jeff Malk said the company\u2019s near-term focus is on demolition and reconfiguration of buildings along Clybourn and Sheffield avenues and Willow Street. Any residential phase would require a zoning change, and its timing and scope have not yet been determined.\nFor now, CRM is betting on retail. It has tapped Savills brokers Todd Siegel, Phil Golding and Kimberly Wiskup to lease the new space, which would represent a relatively rare infusion of large-format retail availability in Lincoln Park. Individual spaces could reach up to 9,500 square feet.\nCRM is pitching the project as a natural extension of the nearby Armitage Avenue shopping corridor, which has thrived in recent years just a few blocks east. The firm is emphasizing walkability paired with on-site parking, aiming to draw both neighborhood foot traffic and shoppers arriving by car.\nMost of the new retail would rise north of Willow Street, which currently splits the shopping center. The redevelopment will also preserve pieces of the site\u2019s industrial past, incorporating masonry towers that date back to a former William D. Gibson Company spring plant, later a Turtle Wax factory, before the property\u2019s conversion to retail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller, which is the one on the hook for the taxes, pressed for doing the deal without a deed.\nThe publication was unable to reach Aimco, led by Wes Powell, for comment.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust that primarily buys and develops apartments announced in November its plan for a\nvoluntary dissolution\n, amid a slower multifamily market. Aimco has been selling off its assets over the past year and listed its Brickell assemblage in 2024 for about\n$650 million\n.\nLast month, Vlad Doronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group and Oak Row Equities, with offices in Miami and New York, bought the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive from Aimco. Mariposa Real Estate, tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, partnered on the purchase.\nThe buyers took out a $464.5 million loan for the purchase from Tyko Capital. The financing was recorded in Miami-Dade records, and the borrowers were the same entities that Aimco used to own the sites for years, but with Oak Row\u2019s Erik Rutter signing the loans on behalf of the borrowers. Rutter leads Oak Row with David Weitz.\nThis signifies that Aimco sold the properties through a transfer of the ownership interest in the limited liability companies it used to own the sites. The practice is legal and sporadically used, though the Brickell deal is the biggest known South Florida sale closed without recording a deed and paying state and county taxes.\nThe Brickell assemblage sale is the biggest urban land site deal in South Florida history, and likely in the state.\nOKO Group\nand\nOak Row\nplan a hotel and branded condos for the first phase of their project. As a whole, the site can be developed with multiple supertalls with more than 3 million square feet. For now, it has two income-producing properties.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The famed developer has been trying to sell the Hamptons estate with little luck for nearly two years.\nOne of the impediments to a sale has been the lack of a certificate of occupancy, needed for a resident to actually live there. East Hampton Village officials have accused Macklowe of illegal land clearing and unpermitted additions that jeopardized the surrounding wetlands. The ensuing drama created a need for an updated certificate of occupancy before somebody could live in the home.\nDouglas Elliman listing brokers Paul Brennan and Martha Gundersen claim there is a \u201cclear path\u201d towards\nresolving the dispute\nand picking up the certificate. The developer agreed to revegetate with low-lying plants and remove a patio. He\u2019ll also need to pay the fines he\u2019s racked up from the village.\nThat should open the door for a certificate of occupancy, though the timeline will be contingent on the cooperation of the weather to allow the revegetation work.\nOnce listed\nfor $38 million\n, the property\u2019s ask was dropped down to $32.5 million, or $5,909 per square foot, in the midst of the dispute.\nMacklowe paid\n$10.4 million\nfor the home in 2017, using it as a residence with his then-girlfriend, Patricia Landeau \u2014 now wife \u2014 during his\nnasty split from Linda Macklowe\n.\nThe 5,500-square-foot home features four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. Futterman Architects designed the home, which includes a waterfront gunite pool and is abutted by Georgica Pond.\nIt is just a stone\u2019s throw from the 9,000-square-foot home Macklowe shared with his ex-wife. That home was listed in 2019 for\n$21 million\n, but Linda ultimately decided to hang on to the pad.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Another sought to speed up housing construction, while the other focused on opportunities to build housing on public land.\nLeila Bozorg, the newly-appointed deputy mayor of housing and planning, said the orders lay the groundwork for what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cI think the executive orders that we put out on day one of the administration really show that comprehensive approach that we want to take,\u201d she said during an interview this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be focused on continuing to build on our housing supply challenges, but also coupling that with important perspectives and tools to protect tenants.\u201d\nAs Mamdani\u2019s housing czar, Bozorg will play a major role in shaping the mayor\u2019s housing plan, building on her work with the previous administration while taking a more aggressive approach to tenant protections.\nBozorg most recently served as Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nexecutive director\nof housing, where she worked extensively on zoning changes under the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. She also served on the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission, which presented voters with four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, including three that created different avenues for project approvals. Before that, she served on the City Planning Commission and was chief of strategy and policy at nonprofit NYC Kids RISE.\nShe also previously was chief of staff to two former commissioners of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, as well as a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration.\nThe Real Deal\ncaught up with Bozorg this week to speak about the new role and the administration\u2019s early actions.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nWhat are your top priorities in this new role?\nI am really going to be focused on building off the foundation of work that I\u2019ve done in my career over the past 15 years to make sure that we are using every tool at our disposal to address our housing crisis, and in this administration, building new tools.\nWhat kind of new tools are you looking at?\nI\u2019m really interested in building off the work that HPD has been doing, not only to build 100 percent affordable housing but [to develop] new, mixed-income tools that allow us to build both market-rate and affordable housing. Especially given the mayor\u2019s ambitious goals to create 200,000 new affordable units, we\u2019re going to have to come up with new, mixed-income strategies to be able to scale to that level of affordable production. We\u2019ll also be looking to work closely with NYCHA, build[ing] on the work that they\u2019ve been doing through\nPACT\n, but also to reposition some of their campuses to do affordable\ninfills\nalong with building off the work at the\nPreservation Trust\n.\nWhat is your role in helping the mayor deliver on some of his key campaign promises, including the promise to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years?\nA huge part of my role right now is going to be helping to identify and appoint new members to the Rent Guidelines Board. It\u2019s ultimately going to be up to the board to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for a rent freeze. But we\u2019re confident that when you look at the various elements that the board has to take into consideration, they\u2019ll find that a rent freeze is appropriate, through the process of both looking at data, taking testimony and looking at the economic conditions that tenants are facing.\nIn addition, we really need to build out our preservation strategies supporting distressed buildings, including distressed rent-stabilized buildings. We want to be looking at different programs to help bring down operating costs. The issue of insurance costs going up is something we\u2019re looking closely at, and whether there\u2019s any public sector tools we can bring to the table to address those types of growing costs. And the mayor has also stated that he\u2019s interested in taking a look at our property tax system, which ultimately creates some of the kind of inequitable outcomes that have created distress in the rent-stabilized stock.\nWhen searching for rent board candidates, are you looking for people who are more amenable to a rent freeze? You said it\u2019s ultimately up to the board to decide, but the mayor\u2019s pledge wasn\u2019t qualified in that way during the campaign.\nThere\u2019s a number of requirements that board members have to meet to be qualified to be on the board. We\u2019ll be looking to make sure anyone that\u2019s appointed is qualified to analyze these issues comprehensively, as required by law.\nHow are you thinking about the role of the Office to Protect Tenants, especially in terms of taking over distressed buildings?\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of things that the office is focused on, not just on distressed properties or the case of bad landlords that need to be held more accountable, but also the types of services that need to be available to tenants and working better for tenants or the types of services that are often available but siloed across government.\nThe city actually [has] a lot of examples of intervening in distressed multifamily properties and helping facilitate preservation purchases. That\u2019s a huge chunk of work that HPD does every day, facilitating preservation transactions so that buildings can be on a better financial foundation and get rehab. The tools already exist, but we\u2019re one week in, and at the early stages of thinking about whether there are gaps in that toolbox that we need to develop for the distressed stock.\nAre you concerned that the housing regulation bills\nvetoed\nby Mayor Eric Adams might be revived by the City Council?\nI\u2019m really excited to be working with the new City Council and with Speaker Julie Menin to advance shared housing goals. And yes, we\u2019ve voiced some concerns about a number of the bills that were vetoed by the last administration, particularly when it comes to the impact that some of those bills may have on the cost of housing production, or how much we can be producing with the limited resources that we have. It remains to be seen whether the Council will override those vetoes, but I have full faith that we have a lot of shared goals and that we\u2019ll be able to work together to address the affordable housing challenge.\nThe last administration did not veto the Construction Justice Act, which established minimum wages for construction workers on certain projects. Do you have a sense of how that\u2019s going to affect the city\u2019s ability to impact city-financed housing going forward?\nIt\u2019s a\nbill\nwe support and look forward to working with the laborers and others to ensure that, as we\u2019re building, people are paid a livable and fair wage.\n(The Adams administration warned that this measure would be the costliest of the housing measures.)\nDo you expect landlords to participate in the\nRental Ripoff\nhearings?\nWe want to be hearing from everybody, including landlords, about the types of issues and conditions that tenants are facing, or maybe the types of unscrupulous fees that they\u2019re facing, but we also want to hear the experiences that landlords and property managers are faced with as well. For too long, we\u2019ve been a bit disconnected from real people\u2019s voices. We\u2019re really aiming to bring New Yorkers into the policy-making process very early on in the administration, so that we can hear from them directly as we\u2019re developing the housing plan and creating a baseline for new housing policy.\nThere are some people in the real estate industry who see the\nearly actions\nof the administration as anti-landlord. How do you think about balancing the push for more tenant protections while also encouraging development of housing by the private sector?\nWe really have to be able to do multiple things at once. We have to be aggressive in addressing our housing supply challenges. That\u2019s why two of the\nexecutive orders\nwere really focused on finding sites for more housing and speeding up the development process. This mayor very much recognizes that we have a housing shortage and wants to be incredibly aggressive on the development front, so we\u2019ll remain a pro-development administration. At the same time, yes, there\u2019s going to be a focus on ensuring we can do that while also protecting tenants. That\u2019s critical for a city like ours, where we have a 1.4 percent vacancy rate. It\u2019s incredibly hard to find housing, and that\u2019s created an uneven playing field for tenants across the whole city.\nWhat do you want to see happen at the Elizabeth Street Garden site, where the last administration abandoned plans for senior housing?\nWe\u2019ll have to take a close look at the\nactions\nthat the last administration made at the very end of the administration, and evaluate the kind of cost and benefit of trying to move forward on the site.\nDoes the city plan to step in or help other portfolios in similar situations as the\nPinnacle\nbuildings?\nWe have a history of supporting preservation of projects that are in physical and financial distress. A large part of HPD work focuses on repositioning properties that are facing both physical or financial distress. We have a number of tools, but we\u2019ll be evaluating case-by-case on what our options are to support buildings and the tenants that live in them.\n",

        "content": "Eric Adams is out of office, but allegations of corruption continue to dog his administration.\nFederal prosecutors indicted Tony Herbert on corruption charges, The City\nreported\n. Herbert allegedly demanded kickbacks from vendors in exchange for city contracts while the Adams associate served as a liaison between City Hall and NYCHA.\nProsecutors allege Herbert shook down a firm seeking a contract to perform security services at NYCHA developments. Herbert allegedly ghostwrote a letter to an unidentified aide to get the security firm pre-qualified as a minority-owned business. He allegedly took a $3,500 bribe from the security firm in 2024.\nLaw enforcement tapped on the security firm\u2019s owner to cooperate in their probe, leading to recorded conversations and saved messages. Texts even allegedly show Herbert communicating with Adams about the need for more security at NYCHA developments, without disclosing the alleged scheme, according to court filings.\nThe vendor did not land the contract.\nHerbert also allegedly took kickbacks from a funeral home director trying to get involved in subsidizing funeral services for low-income residents. Herbert appeared to receive a $6,000 check from the funeral home, referenced in a memo as \u201creferrals.\u201d\nAdditionally, Herbert allegedly defrauded the federal government out of a $20,000 Paycheck Protection Plan loan for a nonexistent bakery.\nIt all came to an end in September 2024, according to prosecutors, on the day the FBI and Department of Investigation seized the phones of multiple senior aides to Adams.\nHerbert \u201cvehemently denies wrongdoing,\u201d his attorney said on Tuesday following his arraignment. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the most serious charges.\nThe federal prosecutor\u2019s office involved in Herbert\u2019s indictment is the same one that launched a bribery and campaign finance case against Adams. The former mayor\u2019s indictment was ultimately\ndismissed\nby the Justice Department as he grew more cooperative with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, arguably costing Adams a second term.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Uncommon Developers\nis tweaking its plans for an apartment building in Hollywood.\nThe Chatsworth-based development firm has\nbeefed up\nits proposal for apartments at 7441 Sunset Boulevard, Urbanize Los Angeles reported.\nA new application filed with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning calls for the construction of a 15-story building with 143 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above parking for 143 vehicles and 3,585 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. That\u2019s more than double the height of the previously proposed building, which would have risen seven stories with 123 apartments above ground-floor commercial space and subterranean parking. The new\nplan\n, like the old one, calls for demolishing a commercial building to make way for the residences.\nThe Department of City Planning recently terminated Uncommon\u2019s entitlement application for the seven-story building, saying the developer wasn\u2019t making progress with the project. Uncommon reportedly was working on a larger project at the site instead. The new application utilizes\ndensity bonus\nincentives, which would allow construction larger than what zoning rules normally allow in exchange for designating 18 apartments for rent by very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, an individual\nmaking\n$53,000 or less annually qualifies as very-low-income, while a household of four must make less than $75,750.\nUncommon recently made a similar pivot in Beverly Grove. Last month, it abandoned its plans for a midrise building at 7959 Beverly Boulevard and instead\nfiled\na new application for a 15-story tower, Urbanize Los Angeles reported. The company has other developments in the works including an under-construction\n405-unit apartment complex in Van Nuys\nand a proposed 12-story apartment tower near the University of California, Los Angeles, campus in Westwood.\nUncommon\u2019s proposed Hollywood project would be built across the street from\nGreystar\n\u2019s new\nRae on Sunset\napartment building, which also features retail below 200 apartments.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Time Out Market is bowing out of Chicago\u2019s West Loop, closing its Fulton Market space less than six years after opening it as an early entrant in the city\u2019s upscale food hall boom.\nThe 50,000-square-foot Time Out Market Chicago at 916 West Fulton Street will shutter Jan. 23, the company confirmed in a statement released Thursday morning. Time Out CEO Michael Marlay cited uneven foot traffic tied to hybrid work patterns and rising operating costs as obstacles to profitability, even as Chicago\u2019s broader recovery has gained steam, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201c[Foot traffic] until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased \u2014 all of which prevents consistent profitability,\u201d Marlay said in the statement.\nThe closure affects more than a dozen local food operators, many of which run their only physical space or a key outpost inside the market. Some vendors had signed leases just months ago, highlighting the whiplash facing small operators that bet on\nFulton Market\u2019s\ncontinued momentum.\nThe building\u2019s owners are already lining up a second act. The building was purchased in 2023 for nearly $36 million by a venture of Luxembourg-based Lagfin, the holding company tied to the Italian billionaire family that owns Campari Group.\nLagfin\npartnered with Chicago developer\nR2\nto manage the food hall, and R2 will now help reposition or re-lease the space.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison told the outlet that ownership is exploring a broad range of options, from another food-and-beverage concept to experiential or flagship retail uses, and that discussions with potential users are already underway.\nTime Out Market opened in 2019, staking out a prime corner of Fulton Market as the district was cresting as Chicago\u2019s hottest mixed-use neighborhood. But the\npandemic-era shift\nin office usage and rising labor and operating costs have battered food halls nationwide. Chicago has already seen several retrenchments, particularly downtown.\nThe situation mirrors the shakeup at\nRevival Food Hall\nin the Loop. Revival announced its closure in July 2024, only for a new operator to step in within weeks and keep the space running under a different banner.\nTime Out Market still operates in 10 cities globally, though\nlocal outlets\nin Boston reported that market is also closing, suggesting broader pressure on the brand\u2019s U.S. portfolio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties is on a mission to\npurchase 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments\nat a bankruptcy auction.\nBut there\u2019s been a thorn in its side: the Mamdani administration, which has filed\nnumerous\nobjections\nto the auction and sale, generating paperwork and press.\nNow, Summit is trying to get the city off its back. In a declaration filed Wednesday, Summit CEO Zohar Levy outlined a plan to fix the bankrupt properties.\nSummit appears poised to be confirmed as the buyer in a Thursday morning bankruptcy hearing. If confirmed, it would foil attempts by the city and renters to find a more tenant-focused buyer. But the declaration also illustrates that New York\u2019s big landlords are living in a new reality, one where the mayor will personally make private transactions a political issue, and hope to extract concessions for tenants where it can.\nIn the declaration, Levy laid out a management structure and timeline to address housing code violations at the properties, seeming to reply directly to city filings arguing the company won\u2019t be able to fix up the properties.\nTenants and the city have cast Pinnacle, the owner who placed the buildings in bankruptcy, as a slumlord, given the portfolio\u2019s nearly 7,000 housing code violations.\nBut Levy says violations in the portfolio appear to be incredibly concentrated. Only 420 of the 5,200 units in the portfolio have documented violations, he wrote, representing just 8% of units.\nLevy outlined a plan to divide the violation-ridden buildings between two management companies. Resources will be prioritized for the Brooklyn portion of the portfolio, which comprises less than half the units but more than 60 percent of the violations.\nSummit plans to spend $30 million over five years on capital expenditures for the portfolio, with $10 million required in the first year to fix existing violations and a maintenance backlog. That works out to about $1,940 per unit in the first year and $5,824 over five years.\nSome of the open violations are, however, immediately hazardous, including vermin infestations and lead paint violations.\nLevy said Summit plans to address half the violations in the first 60 days and the remaining in 180 days. About 13 percent of violations are related to vermin infestations and 20 percent are related to paint and plaster. Others relate to general repairs, lead paint and water.\nAbout 15 percent of the violations are in apartments Pinnacle says it hasn\u2019t been able to access. Levy said Summit is prepared to work with the city to get access to the units.\nThe filing also revealed that Flagstar Bank, the biggest creditor in the bankruptcy, has agreed to finance up to 75 percent of Summit\u2019s $451.3 million bid. The arrangement will lower the mortgage debt on the portfolio by $275 million and lower the interest rate.\nThe mayor\u2019s office, which has objected to the sale in part because of the lack of plan from Summit, declined to comment on the declaration.\nBut the Union of Pinnacle Tenants, representing tenants at the properties, said Summit is trying to diminish the scale of neglect across the portfolio. The city\u2019s housing arm hasn\u2019t been able to complete roof-to-cellar inspections of every unit up for sale, and Summit would be required by law to address the most serious violations within 24 hours, the union said.\nSummit\u2019s existing portfolio already contains more than 5,000 open violations and has earned it a place on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlord\u201d list, tenants said.\n\u201cThe violations recorded are almost certainly an undercount,\u201d the union said of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio in a statement. \u201cThe judge should look at [Summit\u2019s] documented history of neglect, not unenforceable promises.\u201d\nThe city along with tenants have asked the judge to reject the sale. They\u2019ve raised concerns about Summit\u2019s stewardship, financial ability to invest in the properties at the sale price, and also suggested more time would allow for a tenant-focused buyer to bid.\nFlagstar Bank, to whom the Pinnacle portfolio owes $564 million, also objected to that formally in a separate declaration. The city\u2019s argument that the sale price of about $88,000 per unit is too high, the bank said, is antithetical to the goals of the bankruptcy process.\n\u201cIt is also not the approach of a party that believes, and is ready to invest, in the properties,\u201d Flagstar wrote. \u201cIn the end, it appears that the City\u2019s real objective is to scuttle the Sale Transaction so that it has more time to come up with a competing bid for significantly less money.\u201d\n",

The financing will fund the redevelopment and expansion of the Hell\u2019s Kitchen property, which is slated to deliver 316 apartments spread across two towers.\nYellowstone purchased the leasehold interest at the Watson along with the existing mortgage from HSBC\nin 2021 for $175 million\n, after Richard Born and Ira Drukier\u2019s\nBD Hotels defaulted\non the debt the year before.\nBut the project has been slow to move forward. During the pandemic, the 600-key Watson shuttered to traditional guests and was instead used by the city as a migrant shelter amid an influx of asylum seekers. Mayor Eric Adams said last year that the shelter would close by the start of the summer, clearing the way for redevelopment.\nYellowstone filed updated plans with the Department of Buildings this summer, calling for two residential towers and a parking garage in the cellar. Amenities will include an entertainment lounge, gaming room, pet playroom, fitness center and indoor swimming pool. The hotel\u2019s existing rooftop outdoor pool will remain as part of the redevelopment, per the filing.\nThe Watson conversion is the latest in a growing list of Manhattan repositionings by Hera, whose firm has leaned into adaptive reuse as office and hotel distress has mounted. Yellowstone is also pursuing a 422-unit office-to-residential conversion at 1730 Broadway, a Midtown West building it bought from Blackstone last year for $185.9 million.\nHera declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Michael Swerdlow wants rival developer Don Peebles jailed over a four-year-old unpaid $800,000 judgment.\nIn a Jan. 7 motion, an entity managed by Swerdlow, who leads Coconut Grove-based Swerdlow Group, wants Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull to find\nPeebles\nof criminal contempt outside the courtroom. Peebles should be \u201cincarcerated\u201d if Rebull concludes the founder of Miami Beach-based The Peebles Corporation violated a post-judgment court order issued in May, Swerdlow\u2019s motion states.\nThe $800,000 represents legal fees and costs Swerdlow won against Peebles in 2022 tied to their long-running legal battle over a land deal for in Overtown. Swerdlow and his partners SJM and Alben Duffie bought the 3.4-acre property at 249 Northwest Sixth Street for\n$10 million\nin 2020. The same year, two\nPeebles entities\nsued Swerdlow, his affiliate and Duffie for allegedly sabotaging Peebles\u2019 involvement in the land deal.\nFour years later, the joint venture completed Block 55 at Sawyer\u2019s Walk, a mixed-use center featuring 578 senior affordable housing apartments and a 251,000-square-foot office and retail center anchored by Target and Aldi stores.\nMichael Higer, an attorney representing Peebles and two of his entities, dismissed the allegations in Swerdlow\u2019s recent motion. \u201cWe believe it is completely frivolous,\u201d Higer said.\nSwerdlow and his legal team declined comment. In a 2024 interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, the developer blasted Peebles\u2019 lawsuit. \u201c[The allegations] were so ridiculous that the judge threw out every one of them on summary judgment,\u201d\nhe said\nat the time. \u201cNobody thought [Peebles] had a chance.\u201d\nPeebles dissolved the two entities that owe the $800,000 judgment in August, state corporate records show. In doing so, he circumvented Rebull\u2019s May order placing the two entities under control of a receiver, and blocking him from taking any actions on behalf of the entities without court approval, Swerdlow\u2019s motion alleges.\nSwerdlow\u2019s request to have Peebles arraigned for criminal contempt carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Peebles\u2019 alleged end\u2011run around the receivership is the type of conduct that justifies criminal contempt sanctions to \u201cvindicate the authority and dignity of the court,\u201d Swerdlow\u2019s motion asserts.\nPeebles is known for getting into legal fights over government-owned sites he bids on. In January of last year, he and partner Victor MacFarlane sued the City of Los Angeles for allegedly unlawfully terminating their contract to build the\n$1.6 billion\nAngels Landing project Downtown. The project was billed as among the largest African-American-led developments in the city\u2019s history.\nSwerdlow is among the most active developers of government-owned sites in Miami-Dade County. His next big swing is the\n$3 billion Little River District\n, a 64-acre redevelopment that would blanket a nearly mile-long stretch between Miami neighborhoods Little River and Little Haiti. The plan, backed by a 99-year ground lease with Miami-Dade County, envisions roughly 5,700 units on a site assembled from county-owned land and parcels controlled by AJ Capital Partners.\nRoughly 314 apartments would be reserved for residents displaced from four public housing projects, while nearly 3,700 units would be set aside for households earning between 60 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. The first phase, recently cleared by federal housing officials, calls for two new buildings with 600 apartments, while future phases would add a Home Depot, a BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, a supermarket and a new Tri-Rail station.",

The site is at\u00a0 7510 West Sunrise Boulevard.\nDevelopers have seized upon\nsuburban office complexes\nin South Florida with plans for redevelopment, either adding apartments on the parking lots or replacing existing buildings. In Boca Raton, Pebb Enterprises and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are renovating two of the existing office buildings at the Office Depot headquarters campus. The pair is partnering with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group to replace the third building with an\neight-story, 500-unit apartment project\n.

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the financial terms were not disclosed.\nConlon said in a statement on Monday that the investment formalizes a long-term commitment to the\nfirm\nand positions it to retain top talent at a time when mergers, acquisitions and national rollups are reshaping the brokerage landscape.\nFounded in 1985 by Allie Beth Allman, the firm was acquired in 2015 by HomeServices, but has continued to operate under its original name and leadership. Allman stepped down as CEO in 2020 and tapped\nConlon\n, who joined the company in 2008, as her successor.\n\u201cThis is the first transaction of its kind for HomeServices,\u201d Conlon said, describing the deal as a chance to reintroduce a more \u201cgrassroots\u201d ownership mentality. He framed the move as a matter of both retention and recruiting, aimed at agents who want the feel of a locally owned shop without giving up the scale and support of a national platform.\nAllman praised the investment as a safeguard for the firm\u2019s legacy. In the statement, she said Conlon\u2019s buy-in ensures the brokerage\u2019s local roots remain intact, calling the move a natural extension of the succession plan she put in place five years ago.\nThe brokerage has thrived in recent years alongside North Texas\u2019 population boom and corporate migration wave. In 2024,\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\nclosed nearly $4 billion in residential sales volume, driven by 2,674 transactions. According to the publication, the firm ranked as the fourth-largest brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth by sales volume, with 416 licensed agents that year.\nThe firm\u2019s name regularly appears on some of the region\u2019s priciest listings, including a University Park home that became Texas\u2019 most expensive publicly listed residential sale in 2025, asking $35 million.

The property had been marketed for $43.5 million.\nThe ranch sits about 50 miles west of\nFort Worth\nand roughly 18 miles outside\nWeatherford\n, which brands itself as the cutting horse capital of the world. TR9 is known nationally for its top-tier equestrian infrastructure and for housing National Cutting Horse Association Hall of Fame horses including Quintan Blue and Watch Me Whip, according to the publication. Teton Ridge ran a breeding and performance program out of the property during its ownership.\nTeton Ridge held the ranch for about four years and significantly expanded it, Icon Global associate broker\nDon Bell\ntold the outlet. The company grew the property from 618 acres to 860 acres, gutted older structures and built new facilities designed to handle multiple horse disciplines under one roof.\nThe\nranch\nincludes several indoor and outdoor performance arenas, cattle-handling systems, extensive barns and conditioning areas, along with spectator viewing spaces. Bell called it the premier horse training facility in Parker County, noting that it\u2019s rare for one property to accommodate cutting, reining and cow horse training due to differing arena and ground requirements.\nThe buyers operate Theorem Ranch, with holdings in Montana and a vineyard in Napa Valley. In August, the Itkins made headlines in the Western performance world by purchasing a $23 million cutting horse sire, Stevie Rey Von. Jason Itkin is a partner at Houston law firm Arnold &amp; Itkin, while Kisha Itkin has taken a visible role in shaping their ranching ventures.\nIn a social media post announcing the acquisition, Kisha Itkin said the couple plans to \u201cmaximize this ranch\u2019s potential\u201d and position it as a platform to help grow Western performance sports.\nBell said he initially expected the land would need to be sold off in tracts given the cost to operate a facility of that scale. Instead, the Itkins emerged as a rare buyer whose resources matched their ambition. Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz echoed that sentiment, pointing to a \u201cpinhole\u201d market for properties of this caliber.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal works out to roughly $2,100 per square foot. The seller had first put the unit on the market in 2024, and its most recent asking price was $6 million. R New York\u2019s\nAlexander Glibbery\nrepresented the seller.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe top commercial real estate deal to hit records was in Queens. An affiliate of\nBlackstone\nknown as\nPerform Properties\noffloaded a mixed-use complex known as the\nSkyView Parc\nin Flushing for $424.4 million. The buyer was an LLC tied to alternative asset manager\nTPG.\nBlackstone acquired the complex, which has a mall called the Shops at SkyView at\n40-24 College Point Boulevard\nand condominiums at\n40-22 College Point Boulevard\n, in 2015 for about $407.4 million. The mall\u2019s tenants include: Target, Adidas and Old Navy.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nNew York-based\nLexin Capital\n\u2019s sale of a Financial District development site comprised of several vacant lots at\n75-83 Nassau Street\nhit records.\nFull Time Management\nand\nMontgomery Street Partners\nacquired the parcels, which are eligible for the lapsed 421a tax abatement program, for $53 million. The buyers plan to construct a mixed-use complex at the site, a 13,000-square-foot lot that is zoned for residential and commercial use. A JLL team including\nAndrew Scandalios\n,\nEthan Stanton\nand\nJonathan Hageman\nbrokered the transaction. Lexin acquired the lots in 2014 for $46 million.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn Crown Heights, a multifamily complex at\n596 Grand Avenue\n\u200b\u200btraded for $12.3 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAvanath Capital\n, which is headquartered in Irvine, California. The buyers were companies tied to Great Neck, New York-based\nABJ Properties\nand Englewood, New Jersey-based\nKABR Group.\nThe complex has 52 apartments and measures almost 56,400 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $220 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Ruben Flores\nand\nKim Sprague\nsnapped up a sponsor unit at the\nWaldorf Astoria Residences\n, developed by\nDajia US\n, at\n301 Park Avenue\nfor $5.6 million. The two-bedroom unit spans about 1,700 square feet; the deal works out to about $3,300 per square foot. Its asking price was just under $6 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nLoretta Shanahan, Kai Wong\nand\nJade Chan\nhad the listing.\nBy the Numbers:\nThese were the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan in 2025\nThe high points in\nManhattan\u2019s home sale market\nlast year included several eight-figure trophy sales and falling mortgage rates, which helped to drive sales on the lower end of the pricing spectrum.\nAs a result, the borough\u2019s sales volume, both by average dollar amount and total transactions, improved in 2025 from the previous year, according to an analysis of residential data by\nThe Real Deal\n. The number of deals that crossed the finish line came in at more than 13,300 last year, up about 13 percent year over year. And the average sale price was $2.2 million in 2025, an increase of about 4.4 percent from the previous year.\nThe Plaza District held on to its title as the neighborhood with the highest average home sale in 2025, at more than $5.7 million. However, this figure is 4 percent lower than 2024\u2019s winning average of nearly $6 million. There were also fewer sales last year, 142, compared to 174 in 2024.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "New York is taking a crack at reforming its environmental review process.\nGov. Kathy Hochul wants the state to change what projects are subject to the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nAs is often the case with the\nState of the State addresses\n, Tuesday\u2019s was light on details about this proposal. We\u2019ll probably have to wait until next week, when the governor is expected to roll out her executive budget proposals, to get into the weeds on what she envisions. (Unless someone wants to leak some bill language?)\nA spokesperson for the governor indicated that the proposal seeks to exempt a majority of housing projects from environmental review, confirming a Wall Street Journal report from Monday night.\nThat\u2019s more in line with Sen. Rachel May\u2019s bill, dubbed the Sustainable Affordable Housing and Sprawl Prevention Act and first introduced in 2021, which would exempt affordable housing projects with fewer than 1,000 units from SEQRA. \u201cAffordable,\u201d under the measure, would be defined by the state\u2019s housing regulator.\nHochul\u2019s proposal goes further, seemingly including market-rate housing and certain infrastructure projects.\nEnvironmental review reform has long been on the list of Yimby asks in New York. In the past two years, that list has gotten shorter, as the residential floor-area-ratio cap, parking requirements, member deference, accessory dwelling units, the 50 percent test for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and other policies have been crossed off the list (some with asterisks indicating more change is needed).\nHochul\u2019s environmental review reform push comes\nafter\nCalifornia\nexempted\ninfill housing from its state environmental review process. The Senate approved May\u2019s bill last year, but the Assembly didn\u2019t follow suit. Whether Hochul can get the legislature on board with reform this year remains to be seen.\nNew York\u2019s recent attempt to follow California\u2019s lead on another Yimby policy, a version of builder\u2019s remedy,\nfailed\nin 2023. Hochul hasn\u2019t revived the proposal, sticking instead with an opt-in\ncarrot-over-stick\napproach that ties state funding to localities passing pro-housing policies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDid the Verizon outage affect your ability to work on Wednesday? Disrupt any deals? Send a note to/commiserate with me at\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\nvetoed\na bill that would have made it easier for localities to import woodchucks from other states as part of Groundhog Day celebrations, citing risk of introducing new strains of rabies,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The veto means Milltown\u2019s Groundhog Day celebration will once again be without a main attraction.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 More than 10,000 Verizon customers in New York City lost cellphone service as the company experienced a nationwide outage,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cWe are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers,\u201d the company posted on social media. \u201cOur engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly.\u201d\n\u2014 City Council Speaker Julie Menin plans to tap Council member Nantasha Williams as deputy speaker and Council Member Shaun Abreu as majority leader,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\n\u2014 ICYMI, Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s policy agenda this year includes a proposal to scrap an outdated state law that bars dancing in restaurants.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$5.8 million\nfor a 2,800-square-foot condominium unit at 171 West 57th Street in the Plaza District. Alexander Glibbery with We R New York\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor a development site at 75-83 Nassau Street in the Financial District. Lexin Capital sold the land to Montgomery Street Partners.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23.5 million\nfor an 8,159-square-foot townhouse at 146 Waverly Place in the West Village. The Hudson Advisory Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 99,411-square-foot, 16-story mixed-use project at 918 Atlantic Avenue in Prospect Heights. Christopher Fogarty of Fogarty Finger filed the permit on behalf of Elie Parente of EMP Capital Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A Manhattan judge has hit pause on a\nUCC sale\ntied to Worldwide Plaza in a high-stakes legal brawl among three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players.\nIn an order filed Wednesday, the judge temporarily stopped the foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue, which Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development had scheduled for January 15. The decision postpones the auction until January 29 and keeps the current ownership structure in place for now.\nThe ruling came after landlords SL Green and RXR sued to block the sale, arguing it was a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown office complex without a fair, competitive process. The firms claim the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Barnett.\nExtell has\npushed back hard\nagainst the allegations, calling RXR and SL Green\u2019s lawsuit meritless and accusing the two developers of trying to derail a sale they have known about for months. Barnett\u2019s camp argued in a legal filing that the mezzanine lender is within its rights to foreclose after a default and that the auction was properly noticed and structured.\nThe judge directed Barnett to produce further documentation on whether the planned auction is commercially reasonable as the court weighs whether the foreclosure may proceed. Barnett must show that the auction terms comply with the Uniform Commercial Code and are not designed to chill bidding, according to the ruling. Barnett has until January 23 to respond to nine questions Judge Andrea Masley raised about the auction.\n\u201cWe believe the process taken by the mezz lender was improper and are gratified that the judge blocked the sale and ordered the mezz lender to address our concerns,\u201d said Stephen B. Meister, a lawyer for SL Green.\nWorldwide Plaza, a 1.8 million-square-foot office complex near Columbus Circle, has been a prime example of the office market\u2019s continued distress. Control of the mezzanine debt would give the winning bidder significant leverage over the property\u2019s future.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of senior mezzanine debt in 2017 that was later transferred to Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group. Extell apparently bought the loan last year.\nThe property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\nthat\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. The landlords defaulted on both senior and mezzanine debt in July, per public filings.\nRXR declined to comment. An Extell spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis article has been updated with a quote from Stephen B. Meister, a lawyer for SL Green.\n",

Two anonymous sources familiar with the deal said Griffin is a partner on the purchase.\nCitadel didn\u2019t return the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nLed by Andy Gloor, Sterling Bay completed the 10-story\n545Wyn\nin 2021, property records show. It spans nearly 500,000 square feet. The firm hit distress in the past year with a\nfailed Chicago megaproject called Lincoln Yards\nand has been selling off portions of that assemblage as well as other properties in Chicago and\nDallas\n.\nSterling Bay paid\n$18.9 million\nfor the development site in 2019. The seller in that trade was an entity tied to Srebnick.\nGriffin, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $51.4 billion, moved his Citadel and market maker firm Citadel Securities from Chicago to Miami in 2022. He\u2019s been steadily amassing properties in the Magic City, paying a record\n$363 million\nfor a 2.5-acre bayfront lot in Miami\u2019s Brickell, where Griffin plans to build a Citadel and Citadel Securities headquarters supertall. Griffin is partnering with New York-based Related Companies on the tower, which will include a hotel.\nCitadel and Citadel Securities are temporarily\nleasing space\nat 830 Brickell and the Southeast Financial Center in downtown Miami.\nAcross the street from the development site, Griffin owns a small apartment building and vacant lot at 1250 and 1260 Brickell Bay Drive, paying\n$20 million\nfor the properties in 2022.\nGoldman was founded in 1968 by the late Tony Goldman, a pioneer in redeveloping Wynwood. Tony Goldman\u2019s niche was spotting and breathing new life into long-overlooked neighborhoods. He first seized on New York\u2019s SoHo and then on Miami Beach\u2019s Art Deco district, before moving onto Wynwood.

        "content": "Two Roads Development was ordered to restore the waterfront condo building in Miami\u2019s\nEdgewater\nat the center of an epic lawsuit that has dragged on for years.\nThe ruling marks the latest blow to the developer. It means\nTwo Roads\n, a Miami and West Palm Beach-based firm led by Taylor Collins and Reid Boren, will have to return the Biscayne 21 building to a habitable state, including repairs and restoring utilities such as air conditioning, water and electricity.\nMiami-Dade Judge Thomas Rebull ruled in favor of a group of holdout condo owners who sued the developer and the developer-controlled condo association in 2023. The previous year, Two Roads\npaid about $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront condo building, which was constructed in 1964.\nThe developer-controlled condo association was found to have illegally amended the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nThe case nearly made its way to\nFlorida\u2019s highest court\n, after an appeals court sided with the holdouts, affirming that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination. Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined last year to consider a motion for rehearing, effectively ending Two Roads\u2019 options to appeal.\nThe most recent court order, entered on Monday, requires that TRD Biscayne, the Two Roads entity:\nTake all steps to restore the condo association and have it comply with the previous condo declaration, including undoing the condo termination, and reinstate the deeds/condo folios to the individual owners.\nWithin 30 days, file a report detailing obstacles to reinstating the association.\nPrevent the developer from seeking zoning approvals or demolition permits.\nTurn the utilities back on and repair and maintain the condo building, including its common elements, to the condition they were in when the lawsuit was filed in May 2023 at the developer\u2019s expense.\nWithin 45 days, hold an annual meeting where it will have to provide a report to the unit owners regarding the building\u2019s status. The developer-controlled condo association will also have to provide the court with a report every 45 days.\nTwo Roads said in a statement that it \u201canticipated\u201d the court order and that it will comply with all court orders.\n\u201cThe building remains vacant and non-habitable, and any future reconstruction would require professional review and owner approval under the declaration. We will strictly follow Florida laws in this matter,\u201d the statement reads.\nJeffrey Lam, an attorney for the eight holdout owners, said that it\u2019s his understanding the building is still structurally sound. \u201cThe ultimate goal is that we get our clients back to their homes,\u201d Lam said.\nGlen Waldman, also representing the holdout owners, expects the developer\u2019s cost to repair the building is \u201cvery substantial\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s doable.\u201d\n\u201cThis is where a number of our clients wanted to live out the rest of their lives,\u201d Waldman added.\nLam and Waldman said they plan to file an amended complaint that adds parties and claims to the litigation, including the developer\u2019s lenders, principals and former board members.\nTwo Roads\u2019 entity financed the 2022 bulk purchase with a $45 million mezzanine loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC, the asset management affiliate of Fisher Brothers, and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK.\nTwo Roads has been on the hook for mounting interest, in the millions of dollars, on loans tied to the 2022 acquisition.\u00a0Two Roads\nlaunched sales\nof the first of three planned Edition towers, a 55-story, 185-unit tower, with unit prices starting at $1.7 million, months after the 2022 deal. Holdout owners Angelica Avila, Nicolas Bello, Maria Beatriz Gutierrez, Franah Vazir-Marino, Murphy, George Garcia, and two couples, Lazaro Fraga and Jacqueline S. Fraga, and Jeffrey Ulman and Shari Ulman, sued the following year.\n",

Details around the deal, including price, were not disclosed. The property was last appraised in 2021 at $1.8 billion and\nincludes\n1.2 million square feet of studio space, Urbanize Los Angeles reported.\nThe method of acquisition on Goldman\u2019s end is still being determined by both sides. Parties are reportedly discussing handing over the deed to Radford Studio Center, part of a process to voluntarily surrender the property to lenders to have the debt forgiven and to avoid long legal foreclosure proceedings, according to Bloomberg, citing a source close to the matter.\nRadford Studio Center\u2019s revenue covered approximately 21 percent of the cost of servicing its debt as of June 30. Hackman hadn\u2019t made payments on the loan since it matured in June while it negotiated with Goldman, the originator of the commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. Radford Studio Center was 63 percent occupied as of June 30; leases on 36 percent of its space are scheduled to expire by this August.\nHackman\u2019s return of the property comes after months of negotiations to modify its loan there.\n\u201cWe are continuing to work with the Radford lenders on a path forward for this asset,\u201d Hackman Capital told Bloomberg on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a challenging time for all suppliers and independent studio owners and operators in the U.S.\u201d\nThe studio market in Los Angeles has been bruised by years of pandemic shutdowns, the 2023 writer and actor union strikes and the\nconsolidation of studios\n. The number of shooting days fell in each of the first three quarters of 2025 compared to their respective quarters in 2024, per Film L.A. data cited by Bloomberg. Since California doubled film and tax credits last year, the industry has seen signs of a possible production comeback, including a \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel and \u201cBaywatch\u201d series reboot taking advantage of the incentives. In the past, Radford Studio Center hosted productions such as \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\nHackman remains the world\u2019s largest independent\nowner of studio properties\n.

        "content": "Blue Moon Capital Partners rode a Northbrook senior housing property, well, to the moon.\nThe Boston-based firm, led by co-founders\nSusan Barlow and Kathryn Sweeney\n, cashed out of a prime slice of Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs, selling a Northbrook assisted living and memory care complex for a healthy premium. New York-based private equity firm StepStone Group paid $144 million for the facility, called North Shore Place, public records show.\nStepStone bought the property at a 32 percent markup from Blue Moon\u2019s 2017 purchase price of nearly $110 million, public records show. StepStone\u2019s acquisition was structured as a nearly $58 million purchase of the real estate, with the remainder allocated toward furniture, fixtures and equipment for the property\u2019s operations. The buyer used a nearly $94 million Freddie Mac loan arranged by CBRE to fund its acquisition, public records show.\nNorth Shore Place, at 1000 Sunset Ridge Road, sits at the nexus of some of the wealthiest communities along suburban Chicago\u2019s North Shore. When Blue Moon acquired the property over eight years ago, it included 156 units \u2014116 for assisted living and 40 for memory care \u2014 and was already fully occupied with a waiting list. At the time, brokers touted the property as a \u201ctrifecta\u201d for investors due to its luxury design, high-barrier-to-entry location, and expansion potential on excess land.\nBlue Moon and StepStone didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nThe hefty sale price comes as the\nsenior housing market\nnavigates a\ncomplex recovery\n. While independent living has recently flexed more pricing power than assisted living and memory care \u2014 sectors where operators have had to use discounts to maintain occupancy, according to industry publication Senior Housing News \u2014 top-tier properties in supply constrained markets remain commanding.\nWith all styles of senior housing,\nconstruction pipelines\nare thinning and average build cycles stretch to nearly 29 months, according to industry analytics firm NIC. That means new supply is struggling to keep pace with the demographic tidal wave of baby boomers. Such scarcity has kept occupancy rising for 17 consecutive quarters as of late 2025, handing leverage back to owners of stabilized, high-quality facilities, NIC found.\nFor StepStone, the acquisition represents a bet on that long-term imbalance between demand and inventory. For Blue Moon, it\u2019s a lucrative exit that underscores the robust appetite for institutional-grade senior housing, even as the broader commercial real estate market works to regain its footing.\n",

        "content": "Marcel Arsenault landed a financially troubled Chicago office deal with a bumpy entrance into the market and a rough loss for its billionaire seller and lender.\nLouisville, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions, led by Arsenault and known for buying distressed commercial property, acquired the 35-story Magnificent Mile tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue for $132.5 million, the company said Wednesday.\nThat price tag represents a financial bath for the seller, real estate and casino tycoon\nNeil Bluhm\u2019s\nfirm Walton Street Capital. His Chicago-based firm paid roughly $360 million for the 748,000-square-foot tower in 2017, though that deal also included a retail space leased to Apple that was\nsold for $79 million\nin 2019.\nSubtracting the retail sale price, the sale to real Capital marks a value drop of nearly 53 percent, wiping out about $148 million in equity.\nIt also appears to be a short sale. The deal closed well below the $160 million mortgage that ING Capital issued on the property in 2019, leaving the lender to swallow a roughly $27.5 million loss \u2014 a scenario that has become increasingly common as\nborrowers hand back keys\nto their lenders or negotiate exits from underwater offices.\nBut ING may have the chance to make up some of that with more interest payments: Real Capital also obtained some seller financing from ING and co-lenders to fund part of the deal, though the firm\u2019s acquisitions chief Adam Abeln declined to discuss further details of the debt stack with\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cNow, we have the capabilities to close for cash and all these deals, but if we can get financing, it really helps the returns,\u201d Abeln said.\nReal Capital has been circling Chicago\u2019s distressed office market armed with a reported $3.5 billion war chest for bargain-hunting. It previously zeroed in on the 40-story tower at\n190 South LaSalle Street\nbefore backing out and pivoting to the Mag Mile deal.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it just didn\u2019t fit our strategy,\u201d Abeln said of 190 South LaSalle, while also mentioning the difficulty of getting financing for Chicago office deals. Real Capital is also preparing to buy a suburban Chicago office building, though Abeln declined to specify which one at this point. The firm is open to more acquisitions in Chicagoland, though, he said.\nThe deal at 401 North Michigan becomes the latest data point in a grim sequence for Michigan Avenue offices, where valuations are in freefall and institutional owners are throwing in the towel.\nDown the street, a\nBlackstone debt vehicle seized\nthe 517,000-square-foot building at 444 North Michigan in April, after Golub &amp; Co. and partner CIM Group defaulted on a $95 million loan.\nThe pain radiates north, too: in December, a joint venture between\nGolub and Abu Dhabi-based BlueFive Capital\nsaw their loan on 625 North Michigan Avenue sent to special servicing. They joined a similar fate as the former lender for the neighboring\n500 North Michigan Avenue\n, which sold last year for just $5.1 million. That followed a previous owner\u2019s $80 million loan default, giving the 500 North Michigan\u2019s new landlord, Commonwealth Development Partners, a chance to turn it into housing.\nWith 401 North Michigan now trading at a fraction of its replacement cost, it sets a brutal comparable for those nearby landlords still clinging to 2019 valuations.\nThe deal caps a tumultuous period for the property. Walton Street had been hunting for an exit for months. Late last year, the\nSaudi Arabia-backed Olayan Group\nwas in advanced talks to acquire the tower, but that deal\nfell apart\n, forcing Bluhm\u2019s firm to re-list the asset in a market that still hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the pandemic.\nFor Bluhm, the sale is another painful mark on his Chicago ledger. His other marquee asset, the\n900 North Michigan Avenue skyscraper\n, recently required a $56 million equity injection from his other firm, JMB Realty, to secure a refinancing deal as valuations plummeted.\nDespite the financial carnage, 401 North Michigan remains a trophy asset on paper. It is 87 percent leased to tenants including the American Dental Association and BDT &amp; MSD Partners, well above the downtown Chicago average of more than 25 percent vacancy. Real Capital touted the $17 million in recent renovations and the \u201cflight to quality\u201d trends it hopes to capitalize on.\nJLL\u2019s Bruce Miller, Jaime Fink, and John Mason represented Walton Street in the transaction.\nWalton Street\u2019s co-founder\nJeffrey Quicksilver\nand his wife Ashley also made real estate headlines late last year when they sold their lakefront Winnetka estate for $34.5 million, the largest resale of a single-family home in Illinois history. The couple downsized into a lakefront Kenilworth mansion they bought for $14.5 million, a record for that North Shore suburb.\n",

        "content": "The head of one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable luxury brokerages is putting his own money into the brand, making an equity investment in Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates as the firm looks to double down on its local identity amid industry consolidation.\nKeith Conlon, the firm\u2019s president and CEO, acquired an ownership stake in the brokerage, marking an unusual move for a company owned by HomeServices of America, the real estate arm of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the financial terms were not disclosed.\nConlon said in a statement on Monday that the investment formalizes a long-term commitment to the\nfirm\nand positions it to retain top talent at a time when mergers, acquisitions and national rollups are reshaping the brokerage landscape.\nFounded in 1985 by Allie Beth Allman, the firm was acquired in 2015 by HomeServices, but has continued to operate under its original name and leadership. Allman stepped down as CEO in 2020 and tapped\nConlon\n, who joined the company in 2008, as her successor.\n\u201cThis is the first transaction of its kind for HomeServices,\u201d Conlon said, describing the deal as a chance to reintroduce a more \u201cgrassroots\u201d ownership mentality. He framed the move as a matter of both retention and recruiting, aimed at agents who want the feel of a locally owned shop without giving up the scale and support of a national platform.\nAllman praised the investment as a safeguard for the firm\u2019s legacy. In the statement, she said Conlon\u2019s buy-in ensures the brokerage\u2019s local roots remain intact, calling the move a natural extension of the succession plan she put in place five years ago.\nThe brokerage has thrived in recent years alongside North Texas\u2019 population boom and corporate migration wave. In 2024,\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\nclosed nearly $4 billion in residential sales volume, driven by 2,674 transactions. According to the publication, the firm ranked as the fourth-largest brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth by sales volume, with 416 licensed agents that year.\nThe firm\u2019s name regularly appears on some of the region\u2019s priciest listings, including a University Park home that became Texas\u2019 most expensive publicly listed residential sale in 2025, asking $35 million. Its portfolio also includes marquee properties like the Knox Hotel &amp; Residences, the Mount Vernon estate on White Rock Lake and the\nRachofsky House\nin North Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston notched its first ultra-luxury sale of the year with a River Oaks mansion asking $13 million.\nOil broker Jarrad Lewis and interior designer Colleen DiFonzo sold the 11,700-square-foot home at 3649 Chevy Chase Drive to physician Adeeb Dwairy and attorney Caroline Dwairy last week, according to public records and Compass Real Estate.\nCompass agents represented both sides of the deal\n. The final sale price is unavailable, but the asking price amounts to about $1,100 per square foot.\nThe 2023 custom home has five bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a game room and a gym with a sauna and steam shower.\nThe sellers first listed the property in June for $15 million, according to Zillow. Price cuts ensued in July, September and November.\nHowever, compared to other markets, Houston luxury sellers benefit from limited inventory, according to buyer\u2019s agent Christine Laborde. The River Oaks neighborhood isn\u2019t just the city\u2019s preeminent luxury area; it\u2019s one of the city\u2019s only neighborhoods with a steady stock of homes listed above $10 million. Five of the top 10 residential deals in the city last year took place within a mile of 3649 Chevy Chase.\n\u201cAnd so, when those homes come open in Houston, they\u2019re gone,\u201d Laborde said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re inside the 610 loop. You\u2019re closer to multiple sports venues,\u201d Laborde added. And, in a\ncity notorious for its sprawl\n, a centrally located home gains a certain \u201callure,\u201d she said.\nThe average Houston luxury home sold in 52 days last fall,\nhalf the time it took for the average Austin luxury home to sell\n, according to Redfin.\nWhile it\u2019s not a record-breaking deal, the Chevy Chase home outranks some of the top homes sold in the last year. Seven of the\ntop 10 most expensive homes sold in Houston in 2025\nasked less than $13 million.\nThat means the home has a good shot at making the top five sales of 2026 \u2014 unless somebody buys the\ncastle asking $60 millon at 107 Timberwilde Lane\n.\n",

        "content": "Landlords and the state comptroller don\u2019t see eye to eye on the city\u2019s $1.2 billion rental voucher system.\nLandlords say voucher placements are often denied because of small infractions like a\ncracked outlet plate\nor a window guard\nmissing one screw\n.\nYet a comptroller\u2019s audit last week warned that vouchers are being\napproved\nfor apartments with \u201cserious hazards\u201d like a defective window guard and roach infestations.\nBoth sides are correct, but the comptroller needs a reality check.\nIn a program this large, some inspectors will be human and others will be hard-asses. The humans approve tenant placements in units with violations. The hard-asses reject apartments for technical reasons, leaving desperate families in the shelter system and landlords furious.\nThe audit noted that some voucher users end up switching apartments because their first one has problems. This costs the city money. But it would cost a lot more \u2014 and hurt families \u2014 to reduce transfers by disqualifying more apartments.\nRule of thumb: Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. (In\nthis column\n, I explained why zero fraud is a bad goal.)\nThe audit said the city should disqualify all of a landlord\u2019s buildings just because some have serious violations. That\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to know if a building\u2019s problems are because of a bad landlord or because the HSTPA and Rent Guidelines Board\nstarved it of revenue\n.\nThe audit says voucher holders should not be moved into units with roaches. Roaches are disgusting. But they are not as\ndangerous\nas\nhomelessness\n.\nIf the city kicked out tenants from all apartments with roaches, people would go ballistic and the shelter population would skyrocket. Of course the city doesn\u2019t do that. Why should it treat voucher users any differently?\nTo an auditor poring over paperwork, a defective window guard sounds like a life-threatening hazard. But in reality it probably means a few loose screws that can be tightened in seconds. One landlord said a\nsingle missing screw\ncost him a voucher tenant.\nEven if a window guard is broken, a new one\ncosts only $40\nand can be installed faster than an inspector can complete a rejection form. Most landlords have spare window guards on hand.\nI don\u2019t think State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, or Kenrick Sifontes, who directed the\naudit\n, would want to tell homeless families they can\u2019t move into an apartment because one window guard was missing a screw at inspection.\nA lot is at stake for landlords, tenants and taxpayers. CityPHEPS vouchers were a $1.2 billion program last fiscal year. The City Council is suing to force the city to spend even more.\nBefore being elected, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said he would stop fighting the lawsuit, but he hasn\u2019t yet. His budget office might advise him to keep litigating or settle rather than lose billions of dollars for his other priorities. Whatever happens, he is sure to increase voucher spending.\nThat could reduce homelessness, allowing the mayor to shift some of the Department of Homeless Services\u2019\n$4 billion budget\nto permanent housing.\nApartments are\nmuch cheaper\nthan shelters and hotels. However, if left vacant in a quest for perfection, they are useless.\nDiNapoli\u2019s audit has good suggestions about improving oversight and record-keeping. But the notion that the city should only place voucher users in pristine apartments owned by landlords with spotless records is unrealistic.\n",

The Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector received unanimous board support to partner with\nBid4Assets\nto conduct the online sales.

Dominium plans to complete the project in May 2028.\nThe 66-acre, 480,000-square-foot development will include 350 units, which works out to $200,000 per unit. The units will be a mix of single-level buildings and two-story duplexes. The community will also include a clubhouse, a pool, playgrounds and a school bus shelter. These filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe lot is just down the road from the Woodlands Terrell, the city\u2019s first single-family built-to-rent project, developed by Altura Homes in 2023. While Dominium focuses on affordable housing, Altura billed its development as \u201cluxury living in the country.\u201d Dominium is new to the built-to-rent game, and started construction on its first single-family rental-home community in May 2025 in the Phoenix area.\nNorth Texas is one of the leading regions in the country for built-to-rent development. Texas went into 2025 with the\nbiggest pipeline of built-to-rent units in the country\n, notching about\n22,000 units in development\nacross the Texas Triangle. Between June and September 2025,\nDallas ranked second nationally in built-to-rent construction\n, trailing only Phoenix. Fort Worth came in fourth place behind Atlanta. Combined, the cities totaled over 9,000 units under construction.\nBTR developments have mostly spread away from Dallas\u2019 urban core, with\nFort Worth and McKinney\nleading the Metroplex.\nTerrell is about 40 miles east of Dallas on Interstate 20 in\nrapidly growing Kaufman County\n, which saw the second-fastest population increase in the country from 2023 to 2024, according to the Census Bureau.\nWhile the area\u2019s population boom has ramped up its housing needs, the spate of new development in Terrell has piqued residents concerned about congestion, rising home prices and strain on schools. Community concerns delayed approval for\nTerra Nova\n, a 2,000-acre development proposed by Main Square last year. The Plano-based developer modified the project to address concerns.\nAmid increasing home supply, the price of newly built homes and the median sale price of all homes\nboth fell 5 percent year over year\nin Kaufman County last summer.\n",

        "content": "Weeks after the mansion next door found a buyer, an oceanfront lot in Manalapan sold for $27.5 million.\nThe 1.3-acre estate at 1300 South Ocean Boulevard sold to a Delaware entity. The identities of the buyer and seller are hidden. Gary Pohrer with Serhant had the listing, and Marine Rollins with Miami Global Realty brought the buyer.\nThe property last sold for $26.2 million, records show. It has 158 feet of ocean frontage and 200 feet of frontage on the Intracoastal Waterway, according to the listing. The property was offered with plans by Gregory Bonner of B1 Architects, but the buyer will not be using the plans, a source confirmed.\nThe parcel has been on-and-off the market since 2023, asking as much as $38.9 million, according to Zillow. It returned to the market with Pohrer in July, asking $31.5 million.\nThe deal closed weeks after the mansion next door, at 1280 South Ocean Boulevard, which\nPohrer listed for $45 million\n, went pending. The seller of that 15,900-square-foot oceanfront mansion is Rebecca Arcaini, wife of German food additive company founder Tonio G.B. Arcaini. The couple bought the 1.3-acre ocean-to-lake compound for $5.9 million in 2003, and built the eight-bedroom mansion in 2007.\nIt marks the latest in a string of pricey Manalapan deals, a Palm Beach-adjacent enclave that has\ngarnered big prices from buyers prioritizing large lots\nand water access.\nThis month, billionaire Randal Kirk\u2019s Manalapan estate,\nasking $90 million, went into contract\n. Last month, billionaire optometrist and inventor\nDr. Herbert Wertheim paid $62 million\nfor an oceanfront mansion.\nRollins, the buyer\u2019s agent for 1300 South Ocean Boulevard, is the wife of cosmetic surgeon Dr. Aaron Rollins. The couple listed their incomplete\n28,000-square-foot estate on Indian Creek Island for $200 million\nin November, making it the most expensive home on the market in Miami-Dade County. She could not be immediately reached for comment.",

        "content": "UBS is adding another high-profile tenant win to Uptown Dallas, signing on for a new office hub aimed at reshaping how the Swiss banking giant trains and deploys financial advisers in the U.S.\nThe wealth management firm will take 26,000 square feet at 23Springs, a 26-story office building at 2323 Cedar Springs Road, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The filing, first\nreported\nby the Dallas Morning News, estimates UBS will spend $5.6 million on the buildout, with construction slated to start this week and wrap up by June.\nThe new offices will house about 170 employees as part of its Wealth Advice Center, which is focused on serving mass affluent clients through a mix of in-person and centralized advisory services, according to the publication. Dallas will serve as one of four primary hubs for the center nationwide.\nThe move adds to Dallas\u2019 growing reputation as a financial services magnet, a trend sometimes dubbed \u201cY\u2019all Street.\u201d Firms like\nGoldman Sachs\nand\nScotiabank\nhave committed to bringing thousands of jobs to North Texas, clustering largely around Uptown and Victory Park, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Dallas hub follows previously announced Wealth Advice Centers in Weehawken, New Jersey, and Charlotte, North Carolina. UBS has said the business carries a three-year growth plan, with one hub planned for each of its four U.S. market regions. Over that period, the firm expects to hire between 400 and 500 additional advisers, Barron\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe new outpost expands, rather than replaces, UBS\u2019 existing North Texas presence. The firm already occupies two floors at the Crescent in Uptown Dallas, where it employs roughly 70 advisers and about 150 total staff.\nUBS\nalso maintains offices in Plano and Fort Worth, with about 120 advisers spread across the three locations, all of which will remain open.\nFor 23Springs, UBS adds another blue-chip name to a tenant roster that includes Bank OZK, Deloitte and law firm Sidley Austin at the corner of Maple Avenue and Cedar Springs Road. The 625,000-square-foot building is Uptown\u2019s tallest office building and was about 63 percent leased as of August.\n23Springs is a joint venture between Dallas-based\nGranite Properties\nand Highwoods Properties, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based office real estate investment trust, according to the outlet.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "For months,\nrecord rents have been the norm\nfor Manhattan.\nDecember was no different, when median rent for a brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,720, the second-highest number on record, according to a new report from Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. The number also marks a 9 percent annual increase.\nThe numbers show that despite\nflagging mortgage rates\nand a change in the season, high demand is the dominant force in New York City\u2019s rental market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any relief for tenants in 2026,\u201d said report author and appraiser Jonathan Miller.\nThe trend in high rents started in February 2025, odd considering rents usually spike in the summer. But they continued on a tear, reaching a $4,750 per month median in Manhattan in November.\nAlthough elevated mortgage rates may have contributed to the trend by keeping would-be buyers renting, their decline hasn\u2019t put an end to high rents.\nIn fact, both the sale and rental markets are seeing price growth, Miller said. The two usually counter one another, meaning high demand and inbound migration of affluent consumers has likely altered the market, he said. About one-fifth of all leases ended with a bidding war in Manhattan, with renters paying about 9 percent above asking price.\n\u201cSupply and vacancy remain below long-term averages, so the market remains generally tight,\u201d Miller said.\nDespite talk of a \u201cK-shaped\u201d economy, with the rich pulling away from the general populace in terms of income and spending, Miller said we\u2019re not yet seeing a total bifurcation of the market. Median rents for doorman and non-doorman buildings alike are growing at similar rates.\nIn Brooklyn, median rent was $3,850, a more than 10 percent rise from one year ago. About 30 percent of leases were the result of a bidding war in the borough.\nIn northwest Queens, including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City, median rent was $3,652 per month. That represented a 7.6 percent jump from a year prior.",

        "content": "The village of Wellington is moving forward with annexing nearly 450 acres of farmland owned by the Kolter Group, despite objections from Palm Beach County.\nWellington\u2019s Village Council unanimously approved on first reading an ordinance for the annexation of Artistry Lakes at 18551 State Road 80, on Southern Boulevard, at its meeting on Monday. Records show those properties are owned by Kolter\u2019s KH Artistry Lakes LLC, which paid about $75 million assembling 446 acres. Kolter has the right to build 534 residential units.\nPalm Beach County has already approved zoning that will enable the development of 480 single-family homes and 54 workforce townhomes, Tim Stillings, Wellington\u2019s director of Planning, Zoning and Building told council members. Artistry Lakes also includes areas zoned for 23,500 square feet of commercial office and 23,500 square feet of retail.\nThe area is just north of Wellington and west of Arden, a 1,210-acre master planned community zoned for about 2,300 single-family homes where\nLennar\n,\nGL Homes\n, Kenco Communities and other homebuilders are active.\nA second reading vote on the annexation is tentatively scheduled for March 10. Because no one lives on the property it won\u2019t require a referendum. And while the annexation is listed on the village agenda as \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d a letter from Kolter vice president Brian Grove stated that the developer so far has no objections to the annexation.\nThe county, however, filed an objection on Monday, since Artistry Lakes is not yet developed and separated from the village by Southern Boulevard and a canal. Additionally, the land immediately south of Artistry Lakes within Wellington consists of thousands of acres of undeveloped land owned by the South Florida Water Management District, wrote Palm Beach County Planning Director Thuy Shutt.\nStillings countered that 60 percent of Artistry Lakes\u2019 borders are adjacent to single-family subdivisions, which complies with state law.\nCounty officials previously objected to Wellington annexing 258 acres of rural land at Southern Boulevard and Seminole Pratt Whitney Road about a mile away. However, that land was officially made part of Wellington last year following a referendum and later rezoned for residential and commercial development.\nThere are three proposals to build in the newly annexed area, including a pair of Live Local Act projects, each with 106 residential units, and a townhouse project with 206 units, Stillings told\nThe Real Deal\nvia email.\nKolter has been busy.\nLed by CEO Bobby Julien, Kolter affiliate Kolter Urban closed on\n$425.3 million in condo deals\nat its recently finished Selene Oceanfront Residences in Fort Lauderdale.\nKolter and Perko Development Partners\nare also launching sales for a 19-story Maison d\u2019Or condo tower in West Palm Beach.\nKnown for its polo fields, Wellington has attracted increased interest from developers including West Palm Beach-based builder\nSteve Ross\nwho intends to build a private school with 500 residential units and a 180-key hotel. The council also recently approved zoning changes that developer\nMark Bellissimo needs to build Marketplace at the Wellington\n, an 18-acre project with 80 hotel rooms, 89 condo units and 117,000 square feet of commercial and office space.",

Earlier commentary indicated that Jamison was in financing talks to pay the loan off, but that was before the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt came due.\nThe $55 million loan on 3500 West 6th Street, called City Center on 6th, originated in November 2019 and names David Lee \u2014 who co-founded the company that his daughter\nJaime Lee\nnow leads \u2014\u00a0 as a sponsor; David Lee is still chairman. The debt has a current balance of about $51 million, per Morningstar.\nA Jamison spokesperson said in a statement that the company \u201cengaged CBRE and signed a term sheet with a CMBS provider to refinance the matured loan, which is expected to close in 45 days,\u201d and that \u201ctransferring the loan to the special servicer was a strategic decision in an effort to obtain an extension to work out a refinance.\u201d\nSpecial servicer CW Capital Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe three-level, 165,000-square-foot mall was last appraised in September 2020 and received a valuation of $75.6 million, per Morningstar. The mall counts Korean supermarket chain H Mart as a tenant. The shopping center was only 76 percent occupied as of September last year.\nJamison has a number of loans on Los Angeles properties that are in special servicing \u2014 811 Wilshire is one. The latest servicer commentary notes the borrower was unable to pay off the loan and after a deal to sell the downtown office building fell apart, Jamison faces foreclosure, which means not much has changed since\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nearlier reporting\n.\nDavid Lee is the named sponsor on the special serviced loans connected to 811 Wilshire, Equitable Plaza (a 32-story, 688,000-square-foot office tower at 3425 Wilshire Boulevard) and Central Plaza (four, 12-story office buildings located along Wilshire Boulevard), too, according to Morningstar data. But the borrower entered into forbearance agreements on the loans.\nThe collective current balance of the special serviced debt on the four properties mentioned above totals about $230 million.\n",

The project, first\nreported\nby Block Club Chicago, will combine athletic facilities with academic and cultural uses.\nPlans call for sports facilities, an academic learning center and an arts and culture hall, along with a music and media studio, cafe, teaching kitchen, indoor baseball diamond, event space, parking and outdoor areas. The city selected the project through a request for proposals issued last fall aimed at jump-starting new neighborhood amenities and job opportunities on the West Side.\nThe development team is minority-led and West Side-based, a key criterion for the city\u2019s selection. Black-owned construction firm\nBowa Construction\nwill serve as general contractor. The Brim Foundation is partnering with P3 Markets, the local developer of projects like Bronzeville\u2019s\n43 Green\n, to develop the complex.\nThe development will be built on\ncity-owned parcels\nthat will be sold to the development team for about $996,000 \u2014 their appraised value \u2014 according to DPD. The project could also receive up to $10 million in city grants, pending Chicago City Council approval, to help close the financing gap, according to the outlet.\nCity officials framed the complex as part of a broader push to capitalize on momentum along Madison Street and the surrounding neighborhoods. The site sits within the Madison Street Corridor Study area, a three-mile stretch from Hoyne Avenue to Kenton Avenue targeted for long-term public and private investment. It also lies near the $7 billion 1901 Project, which aims to transform land around the\nUnited Center\nwith new entertainment venues, retail, hotels, green space and affordable housing.\n\u201cThe project\u2019s strategic mix of uses and high-quality design will contribute to Madison Street\u2019s ongoing revitalization, while supporting community health and well-being, especially for area youth,\u201d Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said in a\nnews release\n.\nNext steps include a community meeting with leaders from the 27th Ward to gather input and refine plans before moving toward final approvals, according to the news release.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Transwestern is moving its Chicago office to the top of a downtown office tower that has a new Sterling Bay leasing team.\nThe Houston-based real estate services firm signed a lease for roughly 35,000 square feet spanning the top three floors of the 30-story building at 123 North Wacker Drive, according to a company announcement first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Transwestern plans to relocate its Chicago flagship to the penthouse space this fall, consolidating from a space it currently occupies across the buildings at 200 West Madison Street and 181 West Madison Street, its longtime Loop outposts.\nThe move puts\nTranswestern\nin familiar company. Rival CBRE recently decamped to new offices at the building at 300 North LaSalle Street, while Newmark is preparing to relocate its Chicago team to Salesforce Tower Chicago.\nFor\nTranswestern\n, the deal is about more than an address upgrade. Executive Managing Director and Greater Chicago Market Leader Blake Johnson said the new office signals the next phase of the company\u2019s growth in Chicago.\nThe lease carries added weight for the landlord. The 595,000-square-foot tower at\n123 North Wacker\nis owned by a venture led by Los Angeles-based\nMesa West Capital\n, which took control of the property in late 2024 after Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management struggled under a $153 million debt package originated in 2021. With office values sagging amid weak demand and higher interest rates, LaSalle had little incentive to pour fresh capital into leasing as the loan matured, according to the outlet.\nMesa West, which provided a $37 million mezzanine loan as part of that capital stack, stepped in with plans to stabilize and lease up the building. A Mesa West venture was later listed as the borrower on a $115 million senior loan from Wells Fargo, property records show. The firm brought in Sterling Bay brokers to oversee leasing at the tower, which was about 65 percent leased before the Transwestern deal, according to CoStar.\nSterling Bay\u2019s Austin Lusson framed the lease as evidence that top-tier buildings are regaining momentum downtown. Transwestern\u2019s own leasing team, led by Executive Vice President Eric Myers, will also help market the property.\nThe move leaves behind a looming vacancy at the building at 200 West Madison, where Transwestern\u2019s lease expires at year-end. The 45-story tower, owned by BentallGreenOak, is about 86 percent leased \u2014 well above the downtown average \u2014 but will soon be hunting for a sizable backfill, as one of its longest-tenured tenants heads west to Wacker Drive.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyer\u2019s identity for the 46,000-square-foot offices was not disclosed.\nJoseph Moriarty of CBRE represented the seller and Ryan King and Justin Hale of King Realty represented the buyer. The sale price is a more than 350 percent jump from the $23 million figure that Four Corners paid for the property in 2022. Tenants include law firm Sheppard Mullin and investment firm Glynn Capital.\nFour Corners offloaded the property to eliminate some financial risks among its holdings, founder Bruce Burkard told the Business Journal.\nFour Corners also sold 298 South Sunnyvale Avenue in downtown\nSunnyvale\nearly last year for $11.5 million and restructured financing for two other properties, Burkard told the Business Journal.

The company recently closed its acquisition of Quantum Tech Park in San Jose for an undisclosed amount and is in the bidding process for various other sites, Burkard said.\nThe 1540 El Camino Real deal is the latest large sale in the Peninsula in recent months.

Her death is under investigation and a cause of death has not been determined. Her attorney, Evan Torgan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhiteman was 45.\nWhiteman sued the twin brothers under a New York provision, which allowed survivors to sue their perpetrators regardless of when the alleged attacks occurred. The law created a lookback window between Nov. 23, 2022, and Nov. 23, 2023. Whiteman initiated her lawsuit, which also named music producer Ivan Wilzig as a defendant but did not accuse him of rape, one day before the period expired.\nBefore the 2024 lawsuit, Whiteman had previously filed a summons in 2022 against the same three defendants, but did not file a complaint and that case ultimately did not move forward.\nWhiteman met Oren and Alon in New York City around 2008 and continued to run into them in social circles, including at a nightclub in the Hamptons in 2012, according to the complaint. She alleges that Alon grabbed her outside of a nightclub and ushered her into a car with Oren, which took her to a party at Sir Ivan\u2019s Castle, a mansion in Water Mill owned by Wilzig.\nIn a garage at the home, she claimed the brothers locked up her phone and forced her to change into sarong. She alleges that when she tried to run away, a security guard \u201cdragged her back.\u201d The twins then brought her into another room and raped her, according to the complaint.\nThe brothers have repeatedly denied all allegations.\nThey are set to go to trial later this month\non federal sex trafficking charges. In multiple indictments, prosecutors have alleged that between 2008 and 2021, Oren, Tal and Alon participated in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. They allege that the brothers worked together to repeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault and rape dozens of women, some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged attacks.\nThe brothers\nfiled a lawsuit against TRD in June\nalleging defamation and in part disputing coverage that excluded materials the brothers had provided to try to discredit victims.\nTRD\nPublisher Amir Korangy pushed back on the claims in the suit, telling the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe are confident the courts will see this for what it is\u2014a frivolous and cynical attempt to weaponize the legal system.\u201d",

        "content": "A grand jury has indicted Vision &amp; Beyond and co-founders Stanislav Grinberg and Peter Gizunterman for a $50 million bank fraud conspiracy.\nThe Israeli entrepreneurs allegedly double-pledged properties to obtain multiple loans and worked with two title company employees to hide information from lenders and\ninvestors\n.\nGrinberg and Gizunterman, who met while serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, founded Vision &amp; Beyond in 2019 and acquired 100 apartments and residential properties in and around Cincinnati, with the goal of renovating the properties.\nBut the pair allegedly started by double pledging properties to get loans. They also inflated financial information such as rent rolls to obtain larger loans than they should have received from lenders, according to the criminal complaint.\nThen their alleged fraud went further. Grinberg and Gizunterman allegedly used two title company employees, Keya Hamilton and Kelly West to refinance properties, but did not use the funds to pay off the existing loans and mortgages.\nIn December 2022, Grinberg and Gizunterman secured two loans from Corevest Financial totaling more than $36 million to refinance 30 mortgages tied to 60 multi-family properties in the Cincinnati area.\nBut Vision &amp; Beyond stopped paying the loan balance in 2024 and the loans went into default. Grinberg and Gizunterman told the loans\u2019 special servicer that they stopped paying the loans because they had to reenlist with the Israeli Defense Force to fight in the war in Gaza.\nAccording to the indictment, Grinberg and Gizunterman only used the loan proceeds to pay off a fraction of the prior mortgages.\nInstead, more than $273,000 was allegedly paid directly to Hamilton, and about $7 million was paid to a title company controlled by Hamilton and used by Vision &amp; Beyond. About $6 million was paid directly to Vision &amp; Beyond\u2019s account and $2.7 million was paid to another bank, according to the indictment.\nGrinberg was arrested in March, but his indictment was delayed. He is currently in jail in Butler County, Ohio. Ginsburg and his alleged co-conspirators are charged with conspiring to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, making false statements and money laundering.\nVision &amp; Beyond\u2019s properties in Cincinnati have fallen into disrepair, leading with severe water leaks and piled up trash.\nThe indictment is the latest in a broader investigation into\ncommercial mortgage fraud\nby the Department of Justice and the Federal Home Finance Agency. Many of the participants in these fraud schemes bought residential properties in the Midwest such as Cincinnati where property values were relatively inexpensive.\n",

        "content": "Demand for trophy properties is still strong, even in\nAustin\u2019s soft multifamily market\n.\nMachine Investment Group\nbought Rise 120, a 277-unit apartment complex at 120 Boselli Way in the Austin suburb of Georgetown, according to a press release from the New York-based asset management firm.\nGeorgetown-based Novak Brothers developed the property and is the seller, public records show. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was most recently appraised at $47.5 million or $171,480 per unit. Walker &amp; Dunlop provided a $25.7 million mortgage for the acquisition, according to loan documents.\nRise 120 opened in the first quarter of 2024. It offers one-, two- and three-bedroom units and features a pool, fitness center, walking trails, business center, clubhouse and 15,000 square feet of ground-level retail.\nThe property is about 24 miles north of Austin. In 2024, Georgetown was the fastest-growing city in the country for the third year in a row, with its population increasing by more than 50 percent since 2020, Census Bureau data shows. Georgetown\ncrossed the 100,000-resident mark\nin 2025.\nAs a result, Georgetown, in Williamson County, has become a hotspot for development, including a\nmassive expansion at Southwestern University\n, which is within the town. The college tapped Austin-based Banbury Development to develop a 560-acre mixed-used district, envisioned as a \u201cmini city\u201d with housing, offices, retail, restaurants, a boutique hotel, cultural spaces and a concert venue.\nThe\nTexas Municipal League\nin October announced it\u2019s leaving Austin and is relocating to Georgetown. The league said it plans to \u201cinvest millions\u201d to renovate the four-story, 64,000-square-foot Wesleyan Building at 205 East University Avenue.\nWilliamson County\u2019s booming growth has pushed county officials to\nimplement development guardrails\n. The county changed subdivision regulations in 2025 to require developers to conduct traffic impact studies and secure water service commitments earlier in the development process.\nGeorgetown\u2019s growth trajectory combined with the apartment building\u2019s newness mean it\u2019s insulated from the struggles of Austin\u2019s multifamily market. Austin rents and occupancy plummeted after the area saw a flurry of apartment development. The market has been stabilizing, with occupancy flat in the 12-month period ending in October, but rents still fell last year, posting a 4.8 percent decline during the same period, according to data from Yardi Matrix.\n",

Port officials will soon begin hammering out an exclusive negotiating agreement with the entities and have already closed a\nrequest for proposals\n.\nOakland Roots SC and Industrial Realty were two of nearly a dozen firms that bid to redevelop the 55-acre waterfront property. The port began fielding ideas for redevelopment in 2024 after the Athletics departed Oakland.\nPart of the Oakland Roots\u2019 plan involves the construction of a soccer stadium for the Roots and Soul soccer teams. Industrial Realty, meanwhile, is looking to support traditional commodity-based maritime operations, a source close to the matter told the Business Times, though plans are not clear.\nThe Roots are making the \u201cnext steps toward negotiating an exclusive negotiation agreement to explore redevelopment opportunities at\nHoward Terminal\nfor a stadium for Oakland Roots and Soul SC,\u201d Lydia Tan, chief real estate officer for the Roots, said in a statement to the Business Times. \u201cThis would be an important step in evaluating a long-term home for the club, subject to further discussions and approvals.\u201d\nIn October, the port tacked on an addendum to its request for proposals that specified different uses for various portions of the 55-acre site. The westernmost 36 acres would be set aside for\nindustrial uses\n, while 14 acres to the east would be allocated for commercial development; designated uses for the remaining 5 acres aren\u2019t clear. The different requested uses allows the port to consider two projects on opposite sides of the site, as floated by the Roots and Industrial Realty.\nThe Board of Port Commissioners has to sign off on the plans. The port was previously in a four-year exclusive negotiating agreement to build a new 35,000-seat stadium, thousands of residences and millions of square feet of commercial space and public amenities, but the agreement expired in 2023. Last year, the Roots submitted a proposal to build a 25,000-seat stadium at Howard Terminal, first starting with a temporary modular stadium while building a larger permanent one. The Roots have the option to use an already certified environmental review report prepared by the Athletics for their development at Howard Terminal, saving the team time and money in the development process.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

WebAI also plans to install signage near the top of the building at the southeast corner of Sixth Street and Congress, replacing the PMG marquee that currently crowns the tower.\nStream Realty Partners\u2019 Cameron Grier, Brita Hovde and Brad Philp handle leasing for the building at 515 Congress, which is owned by Newport Beach, California-based KBS Realty Advisors. According to Stream, KBS has spent more than $10 million on renovations since 2015 to the 1974-built Class A office building.\nWebAI initially leased the top floor of the building about two years ago and has been steadily adding space as it scales. Its headquarters will sit on the 26th floor, complete with a private elevator, while the ground-floor space will house an engineering lab with freight elevator access for specialized hardware, co-founder and CEO David Stout told the outlet.\nThe office expansion follows a fresh\nfunding round\nannounced Jan. 14 that pegged the company\u2019s valuation at $2.5 billion \u2014 a dramatic leap from the roughly $700 million valuation it carried when it burst onto the scene in 2024. Investors in the round included Time Ventures,\nAtreides Management\n, Forerunner and Oxcart Ventures, according to the publication.\nFounded on the idea that AI doesn\u2019t need to live in massive,\ncentralized data centers\n, WebAI has developed an on-device system designed to let enterprises deploy AI, while keeping sensitive data local and private. It gives companies the flexibility of automation and generative AI without handing over proprietary or customer data to the cloud, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe company employs about 150 people today and expects to reach 200 soon, with the bulk of its workforce based in\nTexas\n. According to the outlet, WebAI also has offices in Virginia, focused on public-sector work, and in Michigan. Last fall, it named Jason Rathje \u2014 a former MIT research scientist and leader at the Pentagon-backed Office of Strategic Capital and the Air Force\u2019s AFWERX \u2014 as president of its public sector.\nWebAI is also pushing into new territory, including aviation and connected devices, while preparing to launch a consumer-facing product that applies AI to personal data without uploading it elsewhere, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Office rents are high and vacancies low amid a slump in new development. Industrial leasing prices are holding steady, but landlords are starting to offer tenant incentives. And multifamily is settling into a more normalized growth pattern after years of fast-paced development, panelists said at the\nCCIM\nconference, held at Florida International University\u2019s south campus this week.\nRetail\nRetail is the darling in South Florida commercial real estate. The sector\u2019s fundamentals are solid, and landlords have seen rent growth since the pandemic, said Franklin Street\u2019s Carrie Smith.\n\u201cIf you are a well-positioned asset, you\u2019re probably feeling pretty good,\u201d she said.\nGrocery-anchored centers are still the most desirable assets, with occupancy averaging 95 to 96 percent compared to low 90s for unanchored properties, she said.\nSeven of last year\u2019s biggest retail transactions involved outdoor shopping centers, selling for a combined $636 million and representing more than half of the\n$1.2 billion\nin combined retail sales for the year\u2019s top 11 deals, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. Half of the outdoor shopping centers in the biggest transactions are anchored by grocery stores.\nMuch of retail\u2019s momentum has come from Florida\u2019s population growth and business expansion, Smith said.\nThe state\u2019s elimination of sales tax on commercial leases in 2024 was a \u201chuge win\u201d for retailers and restaurateurs.Miami retail rents are among the highest in the country.\n\u201cMiami market rents compared to the country are almost double,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing rents in the mid-to-high $40s per square foot triple-net, and some topping triple digits. Supply is low for the demand we\u2019re seeing \u2014 not only in this market, but throughout the Southeast.\u201d\nOffice\nThe office market has experienced turbulence since 2024, after a boom in tenant demand and rents in downtown submarkets the previous two years, said CBRE\u2019s Grant Killingsworth.\n\u201cThe spigot of new tenants from the Northeast quickly dried out,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cWe had landlords with debt coming due turning the keys back to the bank.\u201d\nSome office property owners faced more dire consequences last year.\nA joint venture led by Boston-based Rockpoint sold One Clearlake office tower in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\nin May, representing a 26 percent discount from its 2021 sale price. And New York-based R&amp;B Realty lost\nGateway at Wynwood\n, a Miami mixed-use project with 195,000 square feet of offices, in a bankruptcy auction in August.\nEven so, high-end submarkets saw spectacular rent growth.\n\u201cBrickell went from $65 a foot to $150 a foot,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cThat\u2019s trophy pricing, the same as Midtown Manhattan.\u201d\nSigns Brickell is still booming include Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s\n$275 million\nacquisition of the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center, and a\n$630 million\nrefinancing for 830 Brickell, 57-story high-rise completed in 2024 by Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group and Cain International.\nOther neighborhoods are benefiting from tenant migration.\n\u201cCoral Gables became very attractive,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cFinancial companies that normally never went there are moving because commute times are less and it\u2019s half the cost\u201d of Brickell.\nLooking ahead, the office market will hold steady, Killingsworth said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of the challenging debt cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of new construction planned in the next three years. I don\u2019t foresee any major disruption in rents.\u201d\nIndustrial\nSouth Florida\u2019s industrial sector hit a lull after several years of runaway growth, CommReal\u2019s Edison Vasquez said.\nVacancy went from 5 percent to 6 percent, and it\u2019s more of a balanced market, favoring tenants, he said.\u201cWe saw incentives from anywhere between six to twelve months of improvement allowances and moving expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what they can to avoid empty spaces.\u201d\nBut sales are strong.\n\u201cEnd users will likely pay 10 to 15 percent more than investors, with user sales averaging $275 a square foot and some hitting $300,\u201d Vasquez said.\nBlackstone\nsold about $1.9 billion in warehouse portfolios to institutional buyers last year, he said.\nThis year will bring more rent stabilization and increased leasing activity, he said.\nLand pricing has a disconnect. Sellers want $3 to $4 million an acre, while developers can only pay between $2 million to $2.5 million.\n\u201cThis year will be key to resolving that,\u201d he said.\nOperators face headwinds from property taxes and insurance, but limited inventory should keep values high.\n\u201cPeople are waiting for prices to collapse,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that happening. Prices will continue to stay strong due to limited availability and lower interest rates.\u201d\nMultifamily\nMiami-Dade\u2019s multifamily sector is entering an era of stabilization after years of extreme rent growth fueled by pandemic migrations to South Florida, Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Mitash Kripalani said.\nThe market peaked in 2021 and 2022, when capital was inexpensive and liquidity abundant, he said.\n\u201cRising interest rates slowed down transaction activity, but pricing per unit has remained stable because of strong demand and disciplined investors,\u201d he said\nDevelopment continues at a furious pace, especially in Miami-Dade. About 50,000 units are under construction across South Florida, and over 30,000 of those are in Miami-Dade, most of them in the urban core, he said.\n\u201cDevelopers are choosing dense, walkable, transit-oriented locations with strong employment drivers,\u201d he said.\nSome developers shelved planned projects and sold their entitled\nmultifamily sites\nlast year.\nWith borrowing costs expected to ease this year, Kripalani predicted renewed investment momentum.\n\u201cStable occupancy, stable rents, and improving liquidity is setting the stage for a gradual recovery,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "After more than two decades of false starts, Schaumburg village trustees this week took a decisive step toward resolving the long-running fate of the Loeber Farm site, approving a specific residential development for the 33-acre parcel near the border with Rolling Meadows.\nThe plan, pitched by Elmhurst-based Nitti Group, calls for a mix of 122 for-sale homes, including 43 single-family homes, 37 rowhouses spread across eight buildings, and 42 townhouses in 16 buildings on land just off Meacham Road,\naccording\nto the Daily Herald. It replaces a far\ndenser proposa\nl floated two years ago for 357 rental apartments, townhouses and rowhomes \u2014 a plan that drew fierce opposition from residents and officials in neighboring Rolling Meadows before it was pulled, the outlet reported.\nCommunity resistance\n, however, is hardly new at\nLoeber Farm\n. The property, off Meacham Road near Algonquin Road, has been the subject of competing visions and political friction since the early 2000s, with neighbors repeatedly raising concerns about flooding along Salt Creek, and traffic congestion on a two-lane stretch of Meacham Road. Those issues resurfaced during deliberations on the Nitti plan and remain unresolved even after Tuesday\u2019s approval, according to the outlet.\nThe total development cost for\nNitti\u2019s project\nis pegged at $82 million. Schaumburg is weighing extension of a nearby tax increment financing district that would provide up to $4.8 million in TIF assistance for eligible improvements, out of roughly $17 million in revenue the site is expected to generate over the remaining life of the district.\nThose costs include new water and sewer utilities, a bridge over Salt Creek and a sanitary lift station necessitated by the site\u2019s elevations, according to Schaumburg Economic Development Director Matt Frank. Mayor Tom Dailly said during the meeting that a TIF could help rein in development costs that may have pushed earlier proposals toward higher density. He also flagged the need for a bridge capable of supporting fire engines, a structure he estimated could cost at least $1 million on its own.\nTrustees previously approved Toll Brothers\u2019 55-home plan in 2005, only to see the builder walk away. Dartmoor Homes followed with a similar proposal in 2007, just ahead of the housing market\u2019s collapse, according to the outlet.\nThe land has been owned since 1948 by the family behind Loeber Motors, which operates a luxury dealership in Lincolnwood. After years of stalled negotiations, the family even sought to disconnect the property from Schaumburg in 2020, though that lawsuit was dismissed a year later.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Triangle Sports was about the furthest thing you could imagine from high-end retail \u2014 a Savage x Fenty store by Rihanna, for example.\nLike many Brooklyn kids, I shopped at Triangle in the 1970s and 1980s for balls, pucks and pads. It had a musty smell and stuff was piled everywhere. Sometimes you had to dig through bins to find what you needed.\nBut the sporting goods business at 182 Flatbush Avenue had much higher revenue than the Savage x Fenty that\nsigned a lease\nin 2022 to replace it. I know this because the new outpost\nstill hasn\u2019t opened\n.\nNor does its debut seem near. The ground floor is boarded up and the upper two floors are bricked up. While the other retail space near Barclays Center has enjoyed a resurgence, Rihanna hasn\u2019t put in the\nwork, work, work, work, work, work\nat 182 Flatbush.\nSigns of progress have been\nnonexistent\nbeyond a sign reading \u201cSavage x Fenty Signature Script Collection\u201d observed at the site in 2024. Alas, no one secured a permit for the advertisement, resulting in an ECB violation.\nWhen a blizzard hit late last month, plywood boards fell from the building onto the sidewalk, and neither Rihanna nor the landlord, Hidrock Properties\u2019 182 Flatbush Ave LLC, sent anyone to clear the snow, as you can see from the photograph above.\nThe city ignored the icy sidewalk but slapped Hidrock with a\n$12,500 violation\nfor the plywood mishap, which was resolved 12 days later. In 2023, the owner paid a $1,250 fine for\nleaving a storefront window open\nthree years after a gut demolition of the interior.\nThis is pocket change for Hidrock\u2019s LLC. All this time, Fenty has been paying \u201cdark rent,\u201d meaning rent for unused space, according to one of the Compass brokers who worked on the lease. Given that the asking rent was $650,000 per year, the total paid so far could be about $2.5 million.\nSo, while Rihanna has some\nwork\nto do, Hidrock seems to be doing fine at 182 Flatbush. In 2024, Hidrock\u2019s Abraham J. Hidary reduced the debt to $4 million from $5.2 million as he extended its mortgage with Israel Discount Bank, according to property records.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe name of 182 Flatbush Avenue\u2019s previous owner should ring a bell for\nTRD\nreaders. RedSky JZ purchased the property for $4.1 million in 2012 and sold it to Hidrock for $7 million in 2019.\nThat sale was a rare bright spot for RedSky at the time. By then, things were already\nfalling apart\nfor\nBen Bernstein\nand\nBen Stokes\n\u2019 firm, which had partnered with JZ Capital on that deal and others, assembling a\n$1 billion retail portfolio\n.\nStokes left RedSky in 2024, but his former Cornell squash team member Bernstein is still a principal, according to LinkedIn. Will either Ben ever make another billion-dollar run? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Real estate has something riding on the race to succeed retiring Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who is among the most pro-housing elected officials in the city, is facing off in June\u2019s Democratic primary against Democratic Socialists of America member Claire Valdez, who serves in the state Assembly.\nReynoso is better known, more experienced and has deeper roots in the district, but Valdez has Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s\nendorsement\n. It will be interesting to see how much support from the real estate industry Reynoso receives and accepts and whether it funds a PAC to attack Valdez, as it has done with other DSA candidates.\nElsewhere\u2026\nVoice of Gowanus, a group that formed in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the neighborhood\u2019s 2021 rezoning, continues to seek revenge against Brad Lander, who, as the local City Council member, spearheaded the new zoning.\nThis week, the group cheered Rep. Daniel Goldman for\nobjecting\nto a state cleanup plan and blasted Lander, who is challenging Goldman in this June\u2019s Democratic primary. Voice of Gowanus claimed that Lander wants to locate affordable housing and a school on a polluted site \u201cwithout the fully enforced remediation required by law, leaving behind a massive reservoir of coal tar underground.\u201d\nWhether you like Lander or hate him, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to endanger residents and students. Rather, Voice of Gowanus is trying to undermine his campaign as revenge for the rezoning, which is bringing more than 8,000 badly needed apartments to Brooklyn. It also wants to delay the 950-unit, all-affordable\nGowanus Green\nproject.\nThis is the classic NIMBY strategy of claiming that development would be dangerous to its users. Opponents of a Southern California project I just\nwrote about\nmade the same argument, citing not only wildfires but also pollution from chemicals used on the golf course where 398 homes would be built.\nNone of these people worried about golfers playing on chemically treated grass.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$15.5 million\nfor a 6,820-square-foot single-family home at 13 East 94th Street in Carnegie Hill. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$386 million\nfor roughly 368,000 square feet of office space and 28,000 square feet of retail at 555-557 Broadway in Soho. Publisher Scholastic sold the property to Empire State Realty Trust.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,898-square-foot condominium unit at 200 East 79th Street on the Upper East Side. Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss and Lisa Mathias have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 25,895-square-foot, six-story residential building at 2968 Valentine Avenue in Bedford Park. Jakov Saric of Node Architecture filed the permit on behalf of developer Franc Gjini.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The bankruptcy sale of 5,151 apartments from Pinnacle Group to Summit Properties is on the eve of a possible confirmation.\nBut the sale was unable to close at a Thursday court hearing. The city and tenants had objected to the sale, prompting hours of cross examination and argument before a bankruptcy court judge. Despite conversations about a settlement between the parties, no agreement was reached by the end of the hearing, with an attorney for the city saying that getting approval from the administration would go beyond business hours.\nBy the end of the day, the U.S. bankruptcy court judge, David Jones, was considering arguments from tenants and the city that Summit Properties had failed to make adequate assurances that it could perform and cure the thousands of existing violations in the portfolio for sale.\nSummit CEO Zohar Levy had said in a declaration that Summit planned to spend $10 million in the first year on capital improvements and curing existing violations, with $30 million spent in the first five years.\nHowever, under questioning from attorneys for tenants and the city, Levy specified Summit had planned on just $3 million for the violations and that the money would not be put in escrow or confirmed in a bankruptcy order. The properties would be owned by individual LLCs and there would be no recourse to go after Summit as the parent. Levy testified remotely from Austria and said Summit had engaged REM Management to manage part of the portfolio.\nJones considered arguments that Summit had not shown \u201cadequate assurance of future performance\u201d as a purchaser. But he appeared to be encouraged by a promise by Flagstar Bank, which is the biggest creditor in the case and also the financier for Summit\u2019s potential purchase, that it would extend a $3 million line of credit to Summit to pull from should any of the repairs go over what was estimated. But Jones did not make a ruling Thursday.\nBefore final arguments, parties returned from a lunch break and told the court they had begun talking about a settlement. However, Zachary Kass, the city attorney, said the city would need to go through official channels, including engagement with Mayor Mamdani.\n\u201cGetting the city to do anything is a bit like turning a tanker,\u201d Kass said before the court, later adding that Mayor Mamdani had been engaged.\nAfter another break, the parties said they had exchanged numbers in a negotiation.\n\u201cSummit has the capacity and the commitment to preserve, restore, and improve the 5,151 units and the lives of the residents,\u201d according to Jordan Barowitz, a spokesperson for Summit, adding that the company \u201clooks forward to the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that a settlement will be discussed overnight. Kass said the city would feel more comfortable with some sort of guarantee from Summit.\nIn a declaration, Levy said only 420 units in the 5,151 unit portfolio had housing code violations.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\nAn attorney for Flagstar argued that the city was trying to be unduly involved in a bankruptcy transaction.\n\u201cWhat they really want is to pick the buyer, to pick the price,\u201d the attorney said.\n",

Blackstone acquired the debt after Signature Bank\u2019s 2023 collapse.\nThe Chetrits are members of the high-profile family of investors that has\nmultiple\ndistressed properties\nin New York. The outlet was unable to reach them for comment.\nThe brothers have faced similar troubles before. In 2024,\ndebt dealer\nMaverick Real Estate Partners, which recently bought other Chetrit holdings at auction, sought to foreclose on their SoHo property at 447 Broadway over an unpaid $14.7 million Signature\u2011issued loan. In that case, the Chetrits argued that Signature\u2019s sudden failure deprived them of the opportunity to renegotiate terms.\nThat dispute\nwas settled\nfor an undisclosed amount earlier this year, suggesting they may raise similar arguments again.\nAccording to the new complaint, the Chetrits stopped making payments on the loan in December 2024. Blackstone issued a default notice in May demanding repayment of the remaining principal \u2014 now $15.6 million \u2014 and future rents from tenants, which include a law firm, a psychology practice and an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.\nThe building is 95 percent leased at roughly $40 per square foot, but the owners allegedly did not comply with the notice.\nFor decades, 286 Fifth belonged to the Kiamie family, led by Syrian immigrant and entrepreneur Najeeb Kiamie, whose Windsor Management still operates in the market. The Chetrits, through AB &amp; Sons Group, appear to have co\u2011owned the building with the Kiamies before taking full control.\nAB &amp; Sons signed an $11.1 million mortgage in 2007, and later the 2017 loan that\u2019s now in dispute. The building changed hands internally in 2022, with ownership transferred to an entity called Zhora State Equities.\nBlackstone acquired a large portion of Signature\u2019s loan book in late 2023, including the debt tied to 286 Fifth Avenue. Court filings show AB &amp; Sons\u2019 members include Eli\u2019s son, Abraham.\nAttorneys for the ownership entities either declined to comment or were unavailable, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A townhouse once owned by a fourth-generation Rockefeller has changed hands again.\nGeorge Logothetis, the founder and executive chairman of international holding company Libra Group, sold the home at 13 East 94th Street for $15.5 million, according to public records.\nLogothetis\nbought the home for $12.5 million in 2011\nfrom an entity tied to Renee and Mark Rockefeller, the great-grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman, who represented the previous seller in 2011, had the listing. The home initially hit the market in December 2024, asking $19.5 million before Boardman dropped the price to $17.5 million two months later.\nThe sale is the latest Gilded Age-era townhouse to sell\nafter a price cut\n. A home at\n973 Fifth Avenue\nsold for $46 million in May after initially asking $80 million in 2021, and the\nWoolworth Mansion\nclosed for $38 million after seeking as much as $90 million over a decade ago (more recently, the home sought $50 million).\nSpanning 6,820 square feet, the Carnegie Hill home features six bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\nThe renovated home has a basement gym and wine storage, a fully-terraced back garden and wood- and gas-burning fireplaces. The third floor has a bedroom and a south-facing wood-paneled library, and the primary suite on the floor above comes with a sitting room, dressing room and bathroom with a shower and soaking tub.\nThe top floor has four additional bedrooms, one of which has a terrace, and a large skylight.\nLogothetis founded Libra out of his father\u2019s shipping company and eventually diversified its holdings to encompass a slew of other industries including aerospace, hospitality and real estate. The company has a strategic interest in the luxury hotel brand Auberge Resort Collections after Grace Hotels merged with Auberge in 2018, according to the company\u2019s website.\nLogothetis and his wife, Nitzia, previously owned a condo at the prestigious 15 Central Park West,\nwhich they sold for $24 million in 2011\n.\n",

The buyer was a trust. The nearly 8,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half baths.

GL Homes plans to merge the newly acquired acres with a 120-acre site it bought in 2024, according to the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\n. The developer intends to build 1,000 homes on the combined site.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nRestaurateur\nBarton Weiss\n, also known as Barton G., sold his home at\n1535 West 27th Street\nin Miami Beach to an LLC tied to\nDavid Moradi\n, an entrepreneur and investor, for $29.3 million. The deal for the more than 12,000-square-foot Sunset Islands mansion works out to about $2,400 per square foot. The Mediterranean-style home has nine bedrooms and nine and a half baths and sits along the canal. The property hit the market in March at $39.5 million. Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker had the listing, and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nMarko Gojanovic\nbrought the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Paul Wick\n, a financier, and his wife\nKarin Wick\n, an attorney, via a trust scooped up a newly built, four-bedroom penthouse at the Vita at Grove Isle at\n5 Grove Isle Drive\nin Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. The price was about $20.1 million. The pad has 6,900 square feet of interior space and more than 5,100 square feet of exterior space. The luxury condominium was developed by\nUgo Colombo\u2019s CMC Group.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. existing home sales surge as borrowing costs drop\nThanks to falling borrowing costs and slowing home price growth, existing-home sales in the U.S. surged by 5.1 percent in December compared to the month before.\nThere were 4.35 million existing-home sales last month \u2014 the strongest month in almost three years, according to the\nNational Association of Realtors\n, whose data has been seasonally adjusted.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Exiled\nIranian Americans in real estate\nwatching deadly protests from afar may not agree on a path to peace, but they\u2019re united in seeing this moment as an opening for democratic change in Iran.\nDemonstrations began across the country starting on Dec. 28 when Iranians took to the streets to protest economic conditions, namely inflation. The protests quickly spread with demonstrators numbering in the millions in just a few days. The Iranian government responded with an internet blackout that provided cover to security forces killing protesters; days later, the death toll is in the thousands. President Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene.\nIranians who fled to the U.S. during the 1979 revolution, many of whom settled in California,\nNew York\nand\nTexas\n, haven\u2019t been able to return. Among them is Mehrdad Moayedi, the founder of Dallas-based firm Centurion American Development, who left Tehran in 1976 and moved to Fort Worth at the age of 15. He\u2019s been in North Texas ever since.\nMoayedi, who started with a small landscaping business and became the\nregion\u2019s most prolific single-family lot developer\n, credits his success to the freedom and business friendliness of Texas and the U.S., which he calls \u201cthe greatest country in the world.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything more in my life than to see Iran become more democratic, like the United States,\u201d he said when asked about the protests. \u201cHaving said that, I think we\u2019re at a crossroads and we need some help.\u201d\nA fervent supporter of President Trump, Moayedi approves of his response to the crisis. From his perspective, the U.S. should provide weapons to unarmed Iranians, and Israel should intervene \u201cbecause it has the infrastructure.\u201d\nMoayedi sees the conflict as similar to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, except \u201cthose people are armies.\u201d In Iran, protesters \u201cdon\u2019t have any way of protecting themselves.\u201d\nJewish Iranian developer\nShahab Karmely\n, who operates in New York and South Florida, agrees with Moayedi. His father, who was in the rug business and owned real estate in Iran, was put on a death list but managed to escape with the family in 1978. Karmely, after being deported from the U.S., was taken in as a refugee in the U.K.\n\u201cThe west needs to understand there\u2019s no negotiation [with this regime]. I think President Trump has woken up to this,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cThe bloodshed is beyond anything we can imagine. The same way the Nazis had to go, this regime has to go.\u201d\nThough he stopped short of advocating for a direct invasion, Karmely said \u201cthe time for action is now,\u201d adding that \u201cthe streets are literally awash in the blood of young people.\u201d\nWhile\nAustin-based developer Ari Rastegar\nhas never visited his father\u2019s homeland, \u201cMy entire life has been these conversations and the trauma that ensued from it,\u201d he said. Born in Austin in 1982, Rastegar, who founded Rastegar Property Company, grew up listening to stories from his grandfather, who was the shah\u2019s doctor.\nLike Moayedi, he\u2019d like to see Iran\u2019s leader be someone chosen by the people of Iran, but Rastegar is skeptical about the involvement of superpowers, favoring grassroots leadership that\u2019s \u201cauthentically Iranian.\u201d And, like the diaspora at large, they disagree on how exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi should be involved in the process.\nPahlavi, the son of the last shah of Iran, moved to the U.S. at age 18 in 1978 for pilot training as a cadet in the Imperial Iranian Air Force. A face of opposition to Iran\u2019s government, he has encouraged recent protests.\nMoayedi is optimistic about Pahlavi, suggesting he could lead Iran through transition until the country can elect a leader.\nRastegar disagrees, \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about running a global government, one of the oldest countries in the history of mankind,\u201d he said about Pahlavi. \u201cLet\u2019s find somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nMoayedi and Rastegar, men from different generations who were born in different countries, agree the conflict shouldn\u2019t be used to fuel Islamophobia.\n\u201cIslam doesn\u2019t teach that kind of stuff,\u201d Moayedi said. \u201cThese are just goons and gangsters killing people left and right.\u201d\nIslam is a \u201cvery peaceful, beautiful religion,\u201d echoed Rastegar. \u201cThis is a dictator fuckhead thing. This is not a Muslim thing.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Southern California\u2019s brokerage consolidation continues with Coldwell Banker Real Estate inking yet another franchise agreement that will give it more weight in Orange County and the Inland Empire.\nJessie Rodriguez and Aaron Juarez, formerly of Cal American Homes, are the latest franchise partners with Coldwell Banker, bringing roughly 25 agents into the company\u2019s fold. The new entity has been renamed Coldwell Banker Icon.\nThis latest local move comes a week after Compass and Coldwell Banker parent Anywhere Real Estate closed on their\n$4.2 billion merger\n. The combined business of the nation\u2019s two largest brokerages now counts about 340,000 agents \u2014 and growing.\nThe newest addition, Coldwell Banker Icon, plans to open a South Orange County office by the end of the month and another in Rancho Cucamonga, about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, Rodriguez told\nThe Real Deal\n. The Inland Empire office will be established through the acquisition of an existing company that, if finalized, will add another 60 agents to the roster. The details of both offices will be disclosed once those moves are finalized.\n\u201cI get to be independent still, but now I\u2019ve got this 120-year-old brand behind me that\u2019s recognizable,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI thought, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\nRodriguez launched Cal American Homes around 2009 with an office in Rancho Cucamonga at a time when the region was still reeling from the subprime mortgage meltdown. About three years ago, he decided to move the business to Real Brokerage\u2019s digital platform. With the market becoming more rugged last year, being virtual wasn\u2019t working for his agents. After exploring \u201ctraditional brands\u201d for nearly a year, Rodriguez and Juarez decided to link with Coldwell Banker.\n\u201cI just loved it. It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s luxurious, yet the common person knows the brand,\u201d Rodriguez said, and the then-pending merger with Compass didn\u2019t give him pause. \u201cThis is all at the same time we\u2019re hearing about Compass is going to buy Anywhere and what does that mean? I don\u2019t care what it means. I like Coldwell Banker. I like their leadership. I like their brand. I like their messaging.\u201d\nThe establishment of Coldwell Banker Icon is the latest deal to quickly add scale to Coldwell Banker\u2019s Southern California ranks. But, it is small relative to the franchise agreement the Anywhere Real Estate brand struck in November with a\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\nfranchisee.\nThat deal late last year renamed the BHHSCP affiliate Coldwell Banker Envision and added over 1,300 agents and 14 offices in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties.\nIn 2025, that affiliate business was\nranked sixth\nin Los Angeles County with volume of $2.4 billion in on-market deals within Los Angeles County between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, according to\nTRD Data\n.\nThe franchise agreement did not include BHHSCP\u2019s company-owned business or three other franchisees in Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach and San Luis Obispo.\n",

The 507-unit property\nsold\nfor $161.2 million, or nearly $317,949 per unit, Traded has now reported.\nThe El Centro development is a \u201cbest-in-class, transit-oriented multifamily asset\u201d that Madison bought \u201cat a significant discount-to-replacement cost\u201d in Hollywood, Madison International Realty president\nRonald Dickerman\nsaid in a statement, according to the Times.\nMadison International and Big 4\u2019s acquisition marks the first joint deal for the two firms. Madison is seemingly taking advantage of an appetite for multifamily housing. \u201cInvestors now are starting to look for ways to go on offense,\u201d Dickerman said on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s \u201cDeconstruct\u201d\npodcast in 2024.\nEl Centro consists of 507 units as well as 58,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 1,200-space parking garage. Its location on Hollywood Boulevard near the Hollywood Walk of Fame and historic Pantages Theatre means the property boasts \u201cuntapped retail potential,\u201d Big 4 Properties CEO Terry Considine said, per the Times.\nWith the El Centro purchase, Madison now holds 27 million square feet of multifamily housing across its portfolio.\nOther multifamily properties in Hollywood have been trading hands since last summer. In October, an affiliate of AEW Capital Management purchased the 369-unit Ovelo development at 1331 North Cahuenga Boulevard for $159 million,\nTRD previously reported\n. The sellers in that transaction were Cal-Coast Development and Rescore, a real estate investment trust managed by Encore Capital Management. In August, The Lighthouse Group\nbought\n218 units at 1714 North McCadden Place from a New York Life Real Estate Investors affiliate for $73.9 million.

        "content": "Downtown Chicago hotel owners won strong backing from City Hall this week for a plan to tax themselves, in an effort to juice tourism spending and give the city a louder marketing megaphone.\nMembers of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Finance Committee praised a proposal Tuesday to create a new Tourism Improvement District that would add a 1.5 percent surcharge to hotel stays at downtown properties. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the committee voted to schedule a Feb. 27 public hearing \u2014 the final procedural step before the panel and the full City Council take a formal vote on creating the district.\nIf approved, the\nsurcharge\nwould stack on top of Chicago\u2019s existing 17.5 percent combined city and state\nhotel tax\n, pushing the total levy on downtown hotel rooms to about 19 percent \u2014 the highest in the nation, according to the outlet. Aldermen framed the move as a rare example of an industry volunteering to shoulder a new tax rather than asking the city to spread the pain elsewhere.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking one for the team here,\u201d said Alderman Brian Hopkins. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is supporting the entire hospitality sector and tourism industry.\u201d\nThe proposal has been championed by Choose Chicago and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, which argue that hotel tax revenue meant to support tourism has increasingly been siphoned off to general city needs. IHLA President and CEO\nMichael Jacobson\ntold aldermen at the meeting that money generated by hotel taxes has \u201ceroded,\u201d as it\u2019s been diverted to infrastructure, general funds and other priorities.\nUnder the plan, the new surcharge would generate an estimated $40 million a year, money that would be controlled by downtown hotel owners and\nChoose Chicago\n. That would more than double the tourism agency\u2019s current annual budget of roughly $33 million, giving it more firepower to compete for conventions, trade shows and leisure travelers in an increasingly crowded national marketplace, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThis is simply allowing Chicago to level the playing field, particularly with our major competitive markets,\u201d Jacobson said, noting that more than 200 markets nationwide already use tourism improvement districts.\nChicago welcomed about 55.3 million visitors in 2024, up 6.5 percent from the year before, but still short of the 61.6 million tourists who came in 2019, according to the publication.\nThe district would initially run for five years before requiring renewal. Several aldermen expressed appreciation \u2014 and some surprise \u2014 that hotel owners are backing the added cost.\n\u201cNot a lot of people come and say, \u2018Please tax us for more,\u2019\u201d said Alderman Andre Vasquez.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Michael N. Lerner and his partners offloaded a newly built Uptown apartment complex for $21.4 million, as a bitter legal battle between the developer and his prominent Chicago real estate family has reached a ceasefire.\nA New York-based investment group acquired the 57-unit\nHarmony Apartments at 4511 North Clark Street\n, according to Essex Realty Group, which brokered the deal. The sale lands roughly $1.1 million below the $22.5 million asking price outlined in the property\u2019s listing materials. Essex\u2019s Jordan Gottlieb and Rick Ofman represented the sellers.\nThe sale has not yet hit public records, and the buyer\u2019s identity is not disclosed.\nWhile Essex touted the deal as a win for the Sheridan Park area of Uptown, the transaction plays out against the backdrop of a messy, years-long feud between Lerner and his parents, including Michael J. Lerner, the head of prolific multifamily firm\nMCZ Development\n.\nThe younger Lerner had been entangled in a\nweb of litigation\nwith his parents, who accused him of mismanaging funds and failing to repay loans tied to various projects. Those disputes, which at one point led to the appointment of a receiver to manage some of the family\u2019s contested assets, have started to wind down, with a handful of lawsuits settled in 2025, online court records show.\nBut it\u2019s unclear from public documents if the disposal of the Clark Street property was mandated by those settlements, or if any proceeds will be funneled back to the parental trust that fueled much of the finger-pointing and litigation. The trust alleged that the son\nspent well above his means\nby putting family companies and entities on the hook for debts he took on without sharing loan proceeds, among other purported breaches of contracts.\nThe younger Lerner co-owned the Uptown property with investors Stan and Eugene Bernshteyn, records show, though it\u2019s unclear how much equity each had in the development. The sellers and their representatives didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney for the parental Lerner trust.\nThe deal follows a string of\ndistress and liquidations\nfor Michael N. Lerner. In November, a separate foreclosure case brought by Fannie Mae against him was resolved through the $9.5 million sale of the Chicago collateral property to an entity tied to William Gold\u2019s locally based real estate firm GPO Development Group.\nIn 2023, a high-profile skirmish between Lerner and his father over a\n$35 million Fulton Market development site deal\nwas also resolved through a legal settlement, following the sale to Miami-based developer Crescent Heights.\nFor the Uptown buyer, the acquisition yields a stabilized building in a supply-constrained pocket of the North Side. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthe buyer owns another multifamily property purchased somewhat recently in Chicago.\nCompleted in 2024, the Harmony building includes 56 apartments and ground-floor commercial space occupied by the Black Ensemble Theater.\nMarketing materials for the property projected a 2025 net operating income of about $1.47 million. The retail space, though, had the nonprofit theater organization on a rent abatement that ran through July, according to marketing materials.\nStill, the Black Ensemble Theater is bringing far more value just a block away: Chicago\u2019s Plan Commission last year approved the nonprofit\u2019s Performing Arts Education and Media Technology Center for the property at 4450 North Clark Street, a $76 million complex that will include educational and performance spaces, media and commercial spaces, 53 affordable apartments and parking.\n",

The property is located at 7th Street and Castro Street between Interstate 880 and 960 and is owned by real estate investors Frank and Daphne Yang. A list price has not been disclosed.\nThe 7th and Castro site is zoned for commercial and residential uses with a maximum of 278 units and eight stories. A developer could buy the location and take advantage of the state\u2019s\naffordable housing density bonus\nto increase the unit and height limitations significantly depending on how many affordable units are built.\nIn 2021, developer Wise Investments Enterprise\nsubmitted a pre-application\nto build a 24-story residential tower with 400 to 500 units at the site, San Francisco YIMBY reported at the time. In order to qualify for the state density bonus, the project designated 15 percent of the apartments units as affordable housing, which also allowed the height maximum to increase 190 feet higher than what zoning rules would normally allow. Previous renderings from\nWalnut Creek\n-based LCA Architects showed a four-story parking garage in the building, but the proposal appears to be inactive, according to the Business Times.\nThe 600 Castro site is subject to an S-14 housing overlay zone because it is listed in the city\u2019s housing element, thus guaranteeing the parcel will be used for housing. It also ensures ministerial design review for the project. The site is in a federal opportunity zone, which offers investors tax benefits to promote investment in certain communities as a way of increasing economic growth and job creation.\nThe area around 600 Castro has seen various proposals for housing arise in recent years. At the\n55-acre Howard Terminal site\n, the Oakland Athletics\npreviously floated\nbuilding a new baseball stadium as well as housing and commercial space before the team left town in 2024. An empty lot at 500 Kirkham Street in West Oakland was once entitled for 1,032 housing units, but was seized by its lender in 2023 and put\non the market\nat a $5 million bargain-basement price last fall, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Denver-based DoubleBay Partners and Chicago-based Midloch Investment Partners sold the property. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Mark Thiel and Cory Gross brokered the transaction.\nDoubleBay and Midloch purchased the building in May 2025 for $3.9 million.

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat builders in the Dallas-Fort Worth area started construction on 8,386 homes in the fourth quarter, down 17.7 percent from 10,190 in the same period of the prior year. For the full year, starts totaled 41,222 for-sale homes, a 12.3 percent drop from 46,991 in 2024, according to RSI data.\n\u201cIt is very clear that builder profits will be much lower in 2026 compared to 2025, as DFW remains a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Ted Wilson, a principal at Residential Strategies, wrote in the analysis.\nThe resale market hasn\u2019t offered much relief. Existing home sales in North Texas inched up 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending November, even as listings jumped more than 12 percent to 32,300, according to the Texas A&amp;M Real Estate Center.\nThe slowdown reflects a broader cooling in the region\u2019s economic tailwinds. Job growth in DFW weakened sharply last year, with the metro adding just 18,000 net new jobs in 2025, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. That\u2019s a far cry from the roughly 95,000 jobs that were added each year in the metroplex between 2010 and 2023.\nBuilders\nare also staring at a\nglut of land\n. North Texas ended 2025 with about 110,000 vacant developed lots and another 68,000\nlots in the development pipeline\n, Residential Strategies said.\nThe firm noted early signs of increased traffic heading into 2026, which may not translate cleanly into profits, and fourth quarter prospective buyer traffic leveled off at the end of 2025.\n\u201cBuilders have been able to sell to a backlog of pent-up demand in DFW, but affordability challenges have required price discounting, rate buy-downs, and other incentives,\u201d Wilson said in the report, cutting into margins.\nAt year-end, DFW had 12,317 finished vacant homes, slightly up from the prior quarter, reinforcing\nbuilders\u2019 decisions\nto slow starts while trimming prices on standing inventory. Closings followed the same trajectory. Builders closed on 10,473 homes in the fourth quarter, down 5.5 percent, year-over-year. For all of 2025, closings fell to about 45,000, compared with nearly 48,000 in 2024, according to the data.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Despite the show\u2019s name, the property is in the ritzy neighborhood of Brentwood.\nIt\u2019s the first time in 48 years the mansion has been up for sale. The two-story home was built in 1937 and features six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. The home spans approximately 10,000 square feet and the corner lot itself is 38,510 square feet. The home\u2019s actual footprint is smaller than the fictional Banks family abode on the show, which was said to have 10 bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.\nWhoever buys the house would move into a neighborhood popular among stars. In 2023, Judd Apatow\nsold his home next door\nat 239 North Bristol Avenue for $27 million. The \u201cFresh Prince\u201d house is located two blocks from O.J. Simpson\u2019s Rockingham estate, which grabbed headlines during the late-football player\u2019s murder trial in the 1990s. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan currently lives in the same neighborhood.\nThe home is currently being used as a filming location for an unnamed Netflix series, according to TMZ. In 2020, fans of \u201cThe Fresh Prince\u201d could stay in the manse as part of\na limited-time Airbnb listing\n, Architectural Digest reported. The house was available for five one-night stays, but guests could only access one part of the property including a recreation of\nWill Smith\n\u2019s bedroom complete with 1990s decorations, a full bathroom, a pool with a lounge area and a dining room. The kitchen was off-limits, but guests received meals served on silver platters, according to Architectural Digest.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The fiefdoms of Dallas already survived a Compass campaign. One reigning firm is fortifying its ramparts as Compass\ngrows even larger\n.\nKeith Conlon, the CEO of homegrown Dallas luxury brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, recently acquired an ownership stake in the firm in an\nequity investment deal\nwith its parent company, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based HomeServices of America. The deal aims to keep the company\u2019s center of authority local as\nCompass\ngathers more teams under its banner after its merger with Anywhere Real Estate was finalized earlier this month.\nThe deal also aims to preserve the variety of Dallas\u2019 luxury market, as other Texas markets fuse under\nCompass and its affiliated companies\n.\nBrands founded in Dallas dominate the market. It\u2019s the only city of the state\u2019s three top luxury markets in which the\nbiggest sale of the year\nwas represented by agents outside of Compass or the brands under its umbrella. Two Allie Beth Allman agents negotiated the sale of\n6601 Hunters Glen Road\nin Dallas for $30.5 million, the state\u2019s most expensive residential sale of 2025. Meanwhile, Compass had both sides of the sale for\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\nin Houston, asking $18.9 million, and Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey represented both parties in the sale of\n13330 Shore Vista Drive in Austin\n.\nIt\u2019s not just the biggest sale of the year. Of the top 10 deals in the Metroplex last year, a minority involved a Compass agent, and most involved an agent with one of several Dallas-based brands: Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday Realtors, Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate or Synergy Real Estate. Alongside Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday and Dave Perry-Miller, which are also owned by HomeServices of America, had agents on more than one deal. Dallas firms Brexen and Rogers Healy crop up more in lower-range listings.\nThat\u2019s not the case in Austin or Houston.\nAustin is as varied a market as Dallas, but not with locally-founded brands. Coldwell Banker, Engel &amp; Volkers, Christie\u2019s International and eXp Realty all landed on the Travis County leaderboard last year alongside Compass, Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and Moreland Properties, Compass\u2019 most significant local competitor in the Austin market. Moreland is the only local brokerage with an agent on more than one of the top 10 deals.\n\u201cAll of our key competitors are typically Compass, Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s. You know, these bigger brands that are all franchises and basically\nnow all owned by Compass\n,\u201d said Sarah Railey, president and broker of Moreland Properties.\nMeanwhile, Compass rules Houston. Just one of the top 10 residential deals inked in Houston last year did not involve a Compass agent: the sale of a home at\n3996 Inverness Drive\n, represented on both sides of the deal by Nancy Almodovar, founder of Nan &amp; Co.\nAt the top echelon of Houston\u2019s residential market, Nan &amp; Co has no other consistent competition apart from Compass, Almodovar claimed.\n\u201cWhen we go pitch to a luxury listing, it\u2019s typically just Compass and us,\u201d Almodovar said.\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, Nan &amp; Co and Moreland Properties all weathered a Compass recruitment blitz in 2018 and 2019 that significantly dented other groups.\nNan &amp; Co lost no agents to Compass in 2018, but plenty of other brokerages did. Some \u201cshut down,\u201d according to Almodovar.\nIn Austin, Moreland Properties \u201cchose not to entertain a meeting\u201d with Compass about joining the company, Railey said.\n\u201cCompass would come in and buy companies, not necessarily shutter them,\u201d Railey said.\nAllie Beth Allman, which fields about 400 agents,\nreportedly\nlost 35 agents to Compass then, a third of what Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s lost.\n\u201cThey did a great job of getting some of the top people in the city,\u201d Conlon said.\nHe\u2019s optimistic the equity investment deal will help preserve local control in the increasing homogeneous luxury brokerage world.\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is hamstring our organization because things aren\u2019t going well in Northern California or New York, wherever it may be,\u201d Conlon said.\n",

That\u2019s $182,000 per acre. The builder plans to acquire another tract for $40 million next year, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMinto Communities USA, Westlake\u2019s master developer, was the seller.\nThe acquisition gives GL Homes control of one of the largest undeveloped tracts in the county, as residential and commercial development continues to push westward. Housing, retail and civic amenities have taken shape in Westlake, said Misha Ezratti, GL\u2019s president.\nGL Homes plans to combine the newly acquired land with a 120-acre site it already owns in the city, creating a development footprint large enough for more than 1,000 homes. The builder bought the 120-acre parcel for $29.4 million in 2024 and later completed a land swap with Minto to make the site contiguous, Ezratti said.\nDesign work for the community is still underway, and GL Homes has not yet disclosed the mix of homes or pricing.\nWestlake spans about 3,800 acres and is entitled for 4,500 homes and 2 million square feet of commercial space. Multiple builders are active in the city. The community includes a water park, skate park and sports courts.\nThe deal further cements GL Homes\u2019 growing presence in northwest Palm Beach County. The builder previously developed homes at Arden, south of Westlake, and controls the nearby 5,000-acre Indian Trails site, which is entitled for just under 4,000 homes.\nLarge\u2011scale master\u2011planned projects dominate development activity in the area. They include Minto\u2019s 4,800\u2011acre\nAvenir\ncommunity in Palm\u202fBeach Gardens, which includes nearly 4,000 homes, a hotel, medical offices, retail space and a 2,400\u2011acre nature preserve.\nDevelopers such as Minto and Lennar are investing heavily in the area, but face infrastructure limits and increasing scrutiny from municipalities concerned about preserving\nhome\u2011rule authority over zoning\n.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It\u2019s clear who the losers are in Houston\u2019s\nwave of multifamily distress\n, but it hasn\u2019t yet been obvious how to cash in on the cycle.\nRREAF Holdings\u2019 latest buy provides a template. The Dallas-based investor picked up 2828 at Royal Oaks, a 510-unit garden-style apartment complex at 2828 Hayes Road in Westchase, according to a press release. Deed records show RREAF bought the property after its previous owner lost it to foreclosure.\nMinneapolis-based AB CarVal Investors took control of the property in August in a $20 million credit bid after Wilbraham, Massachusetts-based Colony Hills Capital allegedly defaulted on the $65.2 million loan tied to the property, deed records show. RREAF partnered with Axonic Capital to buy it from AB CarVal Investors for an undisclosed price.\nColony Hills Capital bought the property in 2021 as multifamily investors swept through Texas, picking up aging apartment buildings, with plans to fix them up, raise rents and sell them at a profit. Interest rates blew up their business plans, and many of these investors started losing properties to foreclosure in 2024.\nAs another layer in this distressed multifamily sale, the former owner partnered with Maverick County Housing Finance Corporation (HFC) to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Colony Hills Capital sold the property to Maverick County HFC, an affordable housing organization 330 miles from Houston, and leased the ground.\nIn the 2025 legislative session,\nGov. Greg Abbott signed a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors. Some municipalities took the passage of HB 21 as justification to revoke property tax credits for these deals, although the law provides operators time to come into compliance.\nThe loss of these tax credits has\nexacerbated the wave of distress\nhitting Texas multifamily properties. Houston has been hit particularly hard; for the last year,\nHouston multifamily\nprojects have made up the majority of loans tied to commercial real estate that hit the foreclosure auction block in Texas. In January, troubled\nHouston multifamily loans made up $198 million\nof the $826 million tied to properties across the Texas Triangle headed to auction, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nRREAF is picking up where Colony Hills Capital left off.\nThe new owner plans to rebrand the property built in 1995 as Aura Westchase, with 37 percent of units scheduled for renovation this year. The revamp will also include new signage and upgraded amenities.\nThe purchase adds to RREAF\u2019s 2,000-unit Houston multifamily portfolio. It was RREAF\u2019s third distressed multifamily purchase of 2025 and its first purchase with Axonic Capital, according to the release.\n",

The arbitrator ordered Maidman to pay $22 million in damages.\nResles\u2019 attorney, David Feuerstein, characterized the conduct as \u201ctantamount to theft\u201d and has now filed a lawsuit in New York County Supreme Court to enforce the award.\nAn attorney for Maidman declined to comment to Crain\u2019s.\nCourt records indicate that Maidman transferred seven penthouses to an entity that included his family but excluded Resles, took out loans secured by those units and kept the proceeds. He also arranged for the jointly owned company to issue more than $20 million in interest\u2011free loans to Maidman\u2011controlled entities, while simultaneously collecting an 8.7 percent preferred return for managing the property.\nResles\u2019 firm, Oxford Capital, said the maneuvers drained so much cash from the project that it never made a single dollar in distributions.\nThe ruling marks a significant setback for Maidman, whose family has been active in New York real estate since 1933 and owns about 1,000\nrental units\nthrough its Townhouse Management Company, where Mitchel Maidman serves as CEO. Holdings include a Chelsea hotel and Upper East Side townhouses.\nThe family previously controlled a long\u2011vacant West 42nd Street site before the Durst Organization ultimately took over and developed the Bank of America Tower.\nMurray Hill, on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, has become a hotbed for residential development, including a\n157-unit project\nfrom Brause Realty and a 137-unit luxury\ncondo development\nfrom Continuum Company.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Social\n: Billionaire Jorge Mas bought a waterfront estate in Coral Gables after selling two high-profile properties for over $130M recently\nAfter selling a waterfront lot in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for over $100 million, and his waterfront mansion in Coral Gables for $32 million, billionaire businessman Jorge Mas purchased a mansion in Gables Estates.\nMas, chairman and co-founder of MasTec, a construction and engineering giant, bought a 15,400-square-foot home on Casuarina Concourse. The eight-bedroom, 10-bathroom and three half-bathroom house was completed last year. It sits on a 1.2-acre lot.\nMas, who Forbes estimates is worth about $3.5 billion, has been buying and selling homes under the radar for years. A quit-claim deed transfer of ownership for the Casuarina Concourse sale was recorded in late December without a price, but a source told\nThe Real Deal\nMas paid $75 million for the property.\nThat price marks a record for Coral Gables. Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion at 340 Leucadendra Drive\nfor $55 million,\nwhich set a new record at the time,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nAttorney Roland Sanchez-Medina signed the deed on behalf of the seller, records show. Mas\u2019 ownership is hidden via a land trust.\nIn December, a\ntrust owned by Mas\nand his wife sold the 13,500-square-foot home at 6312 Riviera Drive to a land trust managed by attorney Richard Barbara.\nAround the same time, he sold the\n7.3-acre residential lot\noff of Douglas Road in the Grove to a hidden buyer, sources previously told\nTRD\n. That off-market trade was not recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown. Sources said Mas purchased the waterfront lot this year and flipped it. His purchase was not recorded, and it suggests that he acquired the LLC that owned the lot.\nIn addition to his role at MasTec, Mas is also managing owner of\nInter Miami CF\n, the Major League Soccer team part-owned by David Beckham. Inter Miami is building its mixed-use soccer complex near Miami International Airport.\nBillionaire buyers have been increasingly active since early December, residential brokers say.\nSome prospective buyers are driven by the proposed wealth tax in California. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, recently paid about\n$173 million\nfor two homes in Coconut Grove, including the 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way, and the 10,400-square-foot mansion at 3085 Munroe Drive.\n",

        "content": "One of the most recognizable pieces of San Francisco\u2019s skyline will soon have a new owner.\nSan Francisco-based real estate manager and developer DivcoWest has agreed to buy a significant stake in 101 California, the block-wide, 48-story column of steel and glass at the heart of the Financial District, according to a source close to the deal.\nThe transaction would move one of the city\u2019s premiere pieces of commercial real estate in the most significant office trade in years.\nThe seller is the Hong Kong Monetary Fund, according to Green Street News. The HKMF has owned part of the tower since 2012, when it teamed up with the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, GIC Private Limited, to purchase\na 92 percent stake in the building\n.\nThe stark, 600-foot-tall cylinder contains more than 1.2 million square feet of office space, and hosts tenants such as Chime, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The structure occupies a full block, bound north and south by California and Pine streets, with Davis and Front streets to east and west.\nHines recently put $75 million into a ground-floor renovation\nthat upgraded the outdoor plaza and added a cafe and lounge. That project, drawn up before the pandemic, was completed in 2023.\nThe property still carries a $755 million loan that comes due in 2029. As of September 2025, the building was 82 percent occupied, according to Morningstar Credit.\nAccording to the source, the deal has not yet closed. It is unclear how much of the property DivcoWest has purchased. GIC owns the majority stake, and Texas\u2013based developer Hines \u2014 who developed the property in 1982, and still manages the asset \u2014 owns a less than 10 percent stake.\nDivcoWest manages more than 24 million square feet of real estate assets, worth about $18 billion, across the U.S. Its properties include 540 Madison Ave, a 39-story office tower in Manhattan, and 300 and 301 Howard St in San Francisco, a pair of buildings that contain more than 730,000 square feet of office space in the SOMA neighborhood. The company also holds property in cities such as Austin, Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston.\nThe 101 California tower\nhit the market late last year\nat $900 per square foot, giving the skyscraper a roughly $1.1 billion valuation, a price that was widely viewed as the best test to date of the appetite for prime property in San Francisco. The city struggled to rebound after the pandemic but has appeared to hit a vein of gold once again as the center of gravity for the artificial intelligence industry. San Francisco still carries a nearly 33 percent office vacancy rate, but\ndemand has surged and 2025 marked the best office leasing year\nfor the city since 2019, with 10.2 million square feet of leases signed, according to CBRE.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely off the bottom\u201d of the market, Colin Yasukochi, head of CBRE\u2019s tech arm, told\nThe Real Deal.\nHe called 101 California \u201cone of the most prominent buildings\u201d and that \u201cany renewed investment or commitment to staking space in that building does make a mark.\u201d\nStill, even the $900 per square foot price proposed by the sellers of 101 California, falls below its 2018 valuation of more than $1.4 billion \u2014 nearly $1,200 per square foot.\nDespite the rush for high-quality office space \u2014 almost 90% of San Francisco office leases in the fourth quarter of 2025 were in Class A buildings \u2014 major trades in the city\u2019s trophy market have been minimal in San Francisco since the pandemic. One private equity executive told\nThe Real Deal\nthat, despite the AI boom, borrowing money remains tough for office investments.\n\u201cThe opportunities in San Francisco are probably to get a piece of trophy space, like 101 California, or go buy a class B building and spend a ton of money to make it an attractive and competitive office space,\u201d the executive said.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Larry Page is doubling down on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley \u2014 even as he tries to move one of his startups\u2019 headquarters to Texas.\nDynatomics, a three-year-old AI venture backed by the Google co-founder, filed paperwork to shift the company\u2019s headquarters \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 out of California. On Dec. 30, Page submitted documents to the California Secretary of State converting Dynatomics LLC to an address in Keller, Texas, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAt the same time,\nPage\nleased 73,400 square feet at a newly redeveloped research and development project in Palo Alto, according to CBRE. The company focuses on AI-powered manufacturing and design tools for advanced aircraft. According to the outlet, Dynatomics is expected to occupy space at The Cannery, a conversion of a former Fry\u2019s Electronics store at 340 Portage Avenue.\nWhether that signals a meaningful operational move is unclear. The Palo Alto lease suggests Dynatomics\u2019 core research and development work will remain planted in Silicon Valley. The new facility is expected to house engineers and technical staff, making a wholesale relocation from California unlikely.\nThe Texas filing instead fits a broader pattern for Page, whose recent maneuvers appear driven more by tax strategy. Ahead of a potential wealth tax headed for California\u2019s ballot in November, Page shifted multiple limited liability companies to lower-tax states, including Florida, according to the New York Times, and also snapped up high-end residential property in Miami.\nThe proposed\nCalifornia Billionaire Tax Act\nwould impose a one-time levy on billionaire wealth to fund health care, education and food assistance programs. Page, ranked No. 75 on Fortune\u2019s list of the most powerful business figures, joins a growing list of tech elites quietly adjusting their corporate domiciles in response, according to the outlet.\nThe Dynatomics deal also lands as demand for research and development space on the San Francisco Peninsula shows early signs of recovery. With new construction largely stalled, more companies moved into research and development space than exited last year for the first time since 2021, CBRE said, though vacancy still hovers near 25 percent. The Cannery has been repositioned for engineering testing and prototype manufacturing and sits near an established EV and advanced manufacturing cluster anchored by Tesla and Rivian.\nThe split strategy mirrors broader AI real estate trends. Elsewhere in Texas, a data center startup co-founded by former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt\nis betting on cheap power and wide- open land in the\nPermian Basin\n. Bolt Data &amp; Energy raised $150 million and struck a partnership with Texas Pacific Land Corporation to develop large-scale AI infrastructure, Bloomberg reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A storied townhouse\u2019s \u201ctortured\u201d sales process may have an end in sight.\nThe palatial Upper East Side home at 15 East 63rd Street, which once served as famed designer Oleg Cassini\u2019s studio, has found a potential buyer, according to a recent court filing.\nThe attempt to sell the home has been followed closely, not just because of Cassini\u2019s reputation for romancing stars like Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly and styling celebrities like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but because of the drama-filled bankruptcy proceedings surrounding the home.\nBut the nearly three-year legal fight over the home appears to be coming to a close after two potential buyers came forward in the last few months of 2025. Chapter 11 trustee Albert Togut filed a motion asking the court to approve a sales procedure that would designate the highest bid, a $34.5 million offer from a buyer shielded by a limited liability corporation, as a stalking horse bid prior to holding an auction on Jan. 28.\nThe filing also seeks to designate a $34.1 million dollar offer from tech entrepreneur Yingkai Xu as back-up bidder, and to exempt the sale from transfer taxes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine there is a reason the court wouldn\u2019t approve this,\u201d Togut told\nThe Real Deal\n, pointing to the difficulties that arose during the sales process.\nThe home was originally scheduled to be sold out of foreclosure before Peggy Nestor, Cassini\u2019s sister-in-law, filed for bankruptcy one day before the sale in April 2023 and agreed to either secure new financing or sell the home.\nNestor and her sister, Marianne Nestor Cassini, who married Oleg Cassini in 1971, had accrued an array of liens on the property prior to Nestor declaring bankruptcy.\nThe largest claim on the home resulted from a 2017 loan provided by Lynx Asset Services that the sisters defaulted on less than a year later. Lynx, which filed the original foreclosure and has provided debtor-in-possession financing during the bankruptcy proceedings, has consented to the sale.\nLynx had called the sales process \u201ctortured\u201d after it took nearly nine months for Nestor to sign an agreement with a broker to market the apartment and another three months before the home was listed for\n$65 million\nby Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe sisters had thwarted sales efforts by barring the Sotheby\u2019s team from staging, photographing or marketing the home, according to a filing from Togut on April 10, 2024. Later that month, with help from the U.S. Marshals Service, the sisters were removed from the home which was discovered to be in \u201cdisarray,\u201d Togut wrote in another filing.\n\u201cUntil today, Sotheby\u2019s was completely frustrated and prevented from doing its work,\u201d Togut wrote.\nBut Togut said the Sotheby\u2019s team failed to bring \u201ceven one\u201d credible buyer, and last January handed the listing over to\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi\n, who re-listed the 18,000-square-foot townhouse for $39.5 million.\nHassoumi has shown the home at least 60 times since then, according to an affidavit he filed as part of Togut\u2019s motion.\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied that by working the property the way we did, we got the highest offer we could get, or anyone could get,\u201d Togut said.\nFeaturing seven bedrooms and more than eight bathrooms, the 25-foot-wide home would be part of a run of ornate Gilded Age homes that have found buyers after years of sitting on the market. Last year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011.\n",

Developed in the early 1990s by Michael Shaoul and Michael Rosen, the building once featured an 18-foot statue of Vladimir Lenin perched atop the roof \u2014 a nod, Rosen once told The New York Times, to the neighborhood\u2019s leftist political leanings.\nThat statue came down in 2016, just before Dermot and Rockwood acquired the property for about $105 million. The new owners refaced the building\u2019s red brick facade in white and invested roughly $20 million in capital improvements, according to marketing materials from JLL, where a team led by Rob Hinckley and Jeff Julien brokered the sale.\nThe acquisition marks another step in Atlas\u2019 New York City expansion. The investment and development firm, founded in 2006 by Jeffrey Goldberger and Andrew Cohen, recently made preferred equity investments in the purchase and pre-development of 175 Third Street and 205 Montague Street in Brooklyn and is co-developing the high-profile\n80 Clarkson Street\nalong with a senior affordable housing complex at 570 Washington Street in Manhattan.\nThe Houston Street building is packed with perks aimed at the neighborhood\u2019s young professionals, from a rooftop and landscaped courtyards to an athletic club and tenant lounge.

        "content": "Bally\u2019s Chicago may not hit its long-promised opening date for its permanent casino after all.\nWith the company\u2019s already-extended temporary license to operate at Medinah Temple set to expire in September, state lawmakers are moving to buy Bally\u2019s more time. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat state Representative Kam Buckner introduced legislation Thursday that would allow up to another 12 months of temporary operations while construction continues on Bally\u2019s $1.7 billion casino, hotel and entertainment complex in River West.\nThe bill would effectively push Bally\u2019s deadline to open its permanent facility to as late as September 2027, extending a timeline that has already slipped multiple times.\nBally\u2019s was selected by the city in 2022 to develop the long-awaited casino on the 30-acre former\nTribune Freedom Center\nprinting plant site. The project is slated to include a 500-room hotel, a 3,000-seat theater, an exhibition hall, 10 restaurants and roughly 4,000 gaming positions, making it the largest casino in Illinois.\nBut construction has been anything but smooth. The city halted demolition work at the Freedom Center site in December 2024 after debris spilled into the Chicago River. In May 2025, the Illinois Gaming Board ordered another work stoppage after contractors used an unauthorized waste hauler with alleged\norganized crime ties\n. Last year, Bally\u2019s also had to redesign the site plan and relocate the 34-story hotel tower to avoid damaging water management infrastructure along the river.\nThose setbacks have steadily eroded the project\u2019s schedule.\nBally\u2019s\nhad long targeted a September 2026 opening, aligned with the expiration of its temporary license. That date was later pushed to the fourth quarter of 2026. Even that timeline, the Illinois Gaming Board has said, would require legislative action to keep the Medinah Temple casino open in the interim.\nBuckner\u2019s bill would extend the temporary license by six months, with the option for two additional three-month extensions while construction wraps up. Buckner\u2019s 26th District includes Medinah Temple, where\nBally\u2019s\nhas been operating since September 2023, according to the publication.\nThe stakes are high for both Bally\u2019s and City Hall. The permanent casino is expected to generate far more revenue than the temporary setup, which has underperformed projections.\nBally\u2019s Chicago\nranked fifth statewide last year, posting about $125 million in adjusted gross receipts and 1.3 million visitors, according to Gaming Board data.\nThat muted performance comes as Illinois casino revenue overall is surging. The state\u2019s 17 casinos generated more than $1.9 billion in adjusted gross receipts in 2025, up 15 percent, year-over-year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns told the outlet that the strong pace helped the firm secure a recapitalization of its construction loan now that the building is complete, giving Urbanspace more breathing room as it finishes selling out the project.\nBurns said sales momentum has accelerated since Thanksgiving, a notable bright spot in an otherwise sluggish\ncondo market\nacross Austin. Urbanspace already closed on more than half the tower\u2019s market-rate units, which range from roughly 600 square feet to 6,000 square feet, with one to five bedrooms. The 319-unit building also includes 20 affordable workforce housing condos. The market-rate units range in price from the $400,000s to upwards of $5 million, and the penthouses begin at $9.2 million according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe refinancing was structured through a joint venture between Peregren Capital Group and Koch Real Estate Investments, with senior financing provided by Axos Bank, according to a release. A JLL Capital Markets team led by Senior Managing Director Doug Opalka represented Urbanspace in the deal.\nOpalka said that the refinancing shows strength and confidence in Austin\u2019s luxury residential market, pointing to the project\u2019s location and design as key drivers.\nThe Modern\u2019s performance stands out amid a\nbroader slowdown\nin condo development and sales citywide. Burns said the tower may be the last new downtown Austin condo project completed this decade, as rising costs, tighter financing and softer demand push many proposed projects to the sidelines or keep them stuck in early planning stages.\nThat caution is already showing up elsewhere in Urbanspace\u2019s orbit. Construction on Northland Living\u2019s Luminary condo tower\ndowntown\n, for which Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales, was originally slated to begin in late 2026 but has been paused until market conditions improve, according to the publication. Endeavor Real Estate Group is also taking a wait-and-see approach with a planned condo project at West Sixth Street and North Lamar Boulevard.\nMarket data underscores the chill. Austin-based Team Price Real Estate reported that December condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units, while sale prices have been trending downward.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties was confirmed as the buyer of 5,151 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group in a Friday hearing. Pinnacle, run by Joel Wiener, placed the apartments in bankruptcy. Summit will pay $451.3 million for the portfolio.\nThe hearing marks the end of a weekslong battle, with Pinnacle and Summit on one side and the Mamdani administration and tenants on the other. The latter group tried unsuccessfully to stop, pause and delay the sale, hoping for a tenant-aligned bidder or concessions from Summit.\nBankruptcy judge David Jones considered their argument that Summit had not adequately made assurances that it could perform as the buyer and fix up the portfolio. But ultimately he decided to confirm the purchase, after Flagstar Bank agreed hours into the hearing to extend a $3 million revolving line of credit to Summit.\nThe result highlights the challenges ahead for the Mamdani administration as it tries to throw its weight between private transactions. But it also shows that landlords are living in a new New York: one where the mayor can make their portfolios into political problems, and potentially win even minor concessions.\n\u201cSummit\u2019s statements make clear its commitment to do what is needed,\u201d Judge Jones said. \u201cThe city\u2019s approach to this case gives me confidence that the city will monitor and police Sumit\u2019s performance.\u201d\nSummit purchased the mostly rent-stabilized portfolio for $451.3 million, or roughly $88,000 per unit. Flagstar Bank, the largest creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings, agreed to finance about 75 percent of the acquisition and lower the interest rate.\nThe city first raised concerns about the auction during the Adams administration, when the housing department asked for time for a \u201cpreservation-focused\u201d buyer to put together a bid.\nBut Mamdani raised the profile of the sale and made the auction a political rallying point. His administration originally asked to delay the auction, but\nthe judge rejected that effort\n. At the hearing, the city and tenants\u2019 lawyers raised questions about Summit\u2019s financial wherewithal to cure violations, history as a property owner, and limited experience running real estate in New York.\nBut Judge Jones sided with Summit, saying the company had fielded a \u201cserious and reasonable sounding plan\u201d to improve property conditions.\nSummit chair Zohar Levy said the company plans to spend $10 million in the first year fixing violations and addressing maintenance needs, with $3 million specifically on existing violations. It plans on addressing half the violations in the first two months of the sale and the other half within six months of the sale. Within five years, the company plans to spend $30 million in capital expenditures, or about $5,824 per unit.\nAlthough the city raised concerns that Summit\u2019s current New York properties have thousands of violations, Levy said at the hearing that the company is just a limited partner in those properties and would have greater oversight of the new portfolio. REM Management has been engaged to manage part of the portfolio.\nJudge Jones said Flagstar\u2019s promise of a revolving $3 million line of credit was a \u201cvaluable and helpful\u201d commitment.\nIt\u2019s a mixed result for the Mamdani camp\u2019s first big tussle with private landlords. The administration was unsuccessful in its original goal of stopping the sale and bringing on a nonprofit or tenant-focused buyer. But it was also able to slightly alter the terms of the transaction in a large multifamily portfolio purchase.\nIn a statement, Levy said he understood that the process had been difficult for tenants and that they are concerned about their homes.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a new chapter, and we look forward to working with the City, our elected officials, stakeholders and residents to improve the buildings and move forward,\u201d Levy said in the statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are assembling a strong team and have the capacity, commitment and resources to succeed for everyone\u2019s benefit.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Pinnacle Group noted that the judge\u2019s decision is the end result of an eight-month public process. \u201cThe company, its independent chief restructuring officers and advisors appreciate the court\u2019s recognition that this outcome, achieved in challenging circumstances, is the best available for all constituencies, and hopes the City does too,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe Union of Pinnacle Tenants, which represents a portion of tenants in the buildings, decried the result as a decision in favor of slumlords. But the group said that they would continue to organize for repairs from Summit and for an end to harassment. The group in part credited the Mamdani administration for its speedy intervention in the case.\n\u201cWe will fight this next fight knowing that the City and Mayor Mamdani have our backs \u2014 not just in this auction, but in the long-term,\u201d the UPT said in a statement. \u201cBecause we organized, tenants across the city heard us.\u201d\nThe city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\n",

Images of the home and its address have not been released due to the private nature of the sale, but public records disclose a size of more than 3 acres with an approximately 8,700-square-foot primary house, a few accompanying structures and a pickleball court, according to Robb Report.\nBefore purchasing two properties in England\u2019s Cotswolds \u2014 a favorite location among well-to-do foreigners \u2014 DeGeneres and de Rossi\nbuilt a real estate portfolio\ncomprising multiple properties in Southern California. In 2024, they paid $32 million to buy back an 8-acre estate in Montecito\nthey\u2019d sold earlier that year\nfor the same price. That same year, the couple sold a blufftop estate in Carpinteria\nfor $96 million\nless than two years after acquiring it for $70 million.\nDeGeneres and de Rossi have\nlisted their 43-acre Kitesbridge Farm\nproperty in England for $30 million. The estate comes with a landscaped courtyard, multiple reception rooms and equestrian accommodations for de Rossi\u2019s horses. \u201cWe needed a home that had a horse facility and pastures for them,\u201d DeGeneres previously told the Wall Street Journal of the couple\u2019s stipulations when looking for U.K. property. They also own a modern mansion on a large parcel in a nearby village.\nIt remains to be seen if the new digs in Montecito become the celebrity couple\u2019s main residence or another investment for their continent-spanning real estate portfolio.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
