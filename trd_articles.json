        "content": "The yield on a 30-year Treasury note is\nnearly 5 percent\n. What does that have to do with real estate in New York?\nConsider the real-world example of a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in a prime West Village location. After the death of its tenant for the past 30 years, its owner, a Daily Dirt reader, estimated that it would cost more than $100,000 to do a proper renovation.\nHowever, under the 2019 rent stabilization law, he could only\nrecover $30,000\nof that expense through a temporary rent increase that would raise the rent to $1,428 per month.\nThe landlord calculated that his return on investment would be about 2 percent. That seems acceptable to politicians like Linda Rosenthal, who chairs the Assembly\u2019s housing committee and is herself a rent-stabilized tenant. They expect owners to do the renovation, find another tenant (who might stay for 30 years), and make that 2 percent return, rather than leave the unit empty.\nBut who in his right mind would invest six figures in a rent-stabilized apartment to make 2 percent rather than buy a Treasury note, the safest investment on Earth, and make 4.8 percent?\nTreasury notes are not only more reliable and pay better, but they involve a lot less\nagita\nand effort than rent-stabilized tenants.\nGovernment securities don\u2019t call 311 with complaints, miss payments,\nclog toilets\n,\nbreed dogs\nor make noise at odd hours.\n\nT-notes don\u2019t\nsneak in subletters\n,\nstop paying rent\nand\ntie you up in housing court\nfor two years. They don\u2019t\nset fires\n, flood apartments or cause gas leaks.\nSecurities can be sold with a mouse-click, whereas a rent-stabilized tenant is entitled to perpetual lease renewals and\nsuccession rights\n.\nSinking $100,000 into a renovation is an illiquid investment with a high opportunity cost, meaning the money cannot be repurposed if an\nemergency arises\nor something better comes along.\nTenant advocates say landlords like to overstate the cost of repairs. Why not slap a new coat of paint on the unit, replace the appliances, refinish the floors and call it a day?\n\u201cIf I did a $30,000 renovation, there is a real probability that I would be hauled into court for substandard renovation and would be ordered to renovate the apartment further for free,\u201d the owner said by email. \u201cThat\u2019s why there are more than 50,000 apartments sitting vacant in the middle of a major housing shortage.\u201d\nWith a change in the law, he said, \u201cThey could be back online within six months.\u201d\nThe state legislature reconvenes in January, so the soonest a reform could pass is next year. The latest it could happen is never.\n",

        "content": "In the world of debt and real estate, it\u2019s difficult to keep things all in the family.\nTwo lenders are now casting suspicion upon developer Meyer Chetrit\u2019s effort to pay a debt to his late brother. The lenders claim the family payment is Meyer\u2019s attempt to hide his assets as the creditors come after him for hundreds of millions. It\u2019s just one of the many fights the Chetrit family is waging with its lenders over properties.\nPincusCo\nwas the first to report on the lawsuits.\nMack Real Estate Credit Strategies and Maverick  Real Estate Partners are trying to claw back money from Meyer, to the tune of $220 million for Mack and $132 million for Maverick.\nThe two have drawn attention to a legal maneuver involving Meyer and the estate of his late brother, Jacob Chetrit. In June, Meyer filed a court document saying that he owed his brother\u2019s estate $21.7 million. That case also revealed Jacob Chetrit\u2019s net worth when he died in January: $825 million.\nLawyers for Mack Real Estate argued Meyer\u2019s legal maneuver \u201creeks of fraud.\u201d In a memo filed this week, they claim Meyer\u2019s debt to his brother is an effort to remove assets from his name or allow the estate to claim priority.\nCourt documents from Meyer and the estate say he owes his brother repayment for loans he received, as well as funding he was meant to invest in their shared transactions.\n\nMack is the lender behind two Chetrit properties: the Hotel Carter on West 43rd Street and 545 West 37th Street. In an ongoing case, the creditor claims Meyer and other brother Joseph Chetrit owe them $220 million in loans and guarantees.\nMaverick already won its $132 million judgment against Meyer and is seeking to enforce it in court. Elliott Joffe, a lawyer for Baron Samson who is representing Meyer in the Maverick case, said attorneys \u201cdeny in the strongest terms possible any and all allegations of fraud or wrongdoing.\u201d\nThat debt in that case arises from loans connected to a Midtown development site where the Chetrit Group once planned to build a 33-story hotel. Maverick\nseized\nthe site in 2023.\nIn June, Maverick won a temporary court order preventing Meyer from executing the debt payment to his brother\u2019s estate.\nLawyers for Meyer Chetrit and the estate of Jacob Chetrit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nElsewhere, Meyer Chetrit is facing allegations of\nintentional self-dealing\nand\nmismanagement\nin foreclosure suits from lenders.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article mistakenly named Maverick Financial, not Maverick  Real Estate Partners\n,\nas one of the lenders behind the lawsuits.",

The total was significantly less than the 25 deals inked in the\nprevious period\nand marked the lowest total since September 2023.\nA penthouse at Naftali Group\u2019s 255 East 77th Street, asking $24.7 million, was the priciest property to land a signed contract. Unit PHB spans 5,500 square feet and has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a loggia, views of Central Park and 15-foot ceilings.\nSales at the Lenox Hill condominium launched last fall with Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, led by Alexa Lambert, Alison Black and Shelton Smith, at the helm. Since then, 41 of the building\u2019s 62 units have entered contract with an average asking price of $2,700 per square foot.\nAmenities at the Robert A.M. Stern-designed building include a garage, fitness center, swimming pool and recording studio.\n\nMiki Naftali purchased the development site in 2021 for $73 million, and initial plans for the project pegged the sellout at more than $531 million. The developer scored a $236 construction loan from JP Morgan and Starwood Capital in 2023, followed by another\n$140 million\nfrom JP Morgan a year later.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a townhouse on the Upper East Side, with an asking price of $8.8 million. The five-story, 9,500-square-foot property, divided into offices, a home and a one-bedroom rental unit, hit the market two years ago asking $11 million.\nCompass\u2019 Ian Slater, Brett Walsdorf and Michael Koeneke had the listing.\nOf the nine properties, eight were condos, and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $79.8 million, for an average price of $8.9 million and a median of $7.2 million. The typical home spent more than 580 days on the market and was discounted 11 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "Municipal bondholders in New Jersey\u2019s American Dream Mall are running out of runway.\nA state tax judge last week slashed the megamall\u2019s assessed value by $850 million, bringing it to $1.65 billion for the current tax year. That\u2019s down about $800 million from what the Borough of East Rutherford pegged it at\nearlier this year\nand nearly $1.7 billion less than the property\u2019s previous appraisal, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nThe reduction is the latest blow to bondholders carrying $800 million in debt backed by PILOTs \u2014 payments in lieu of taxes \u2014 meant to fund the mall\u2019s development. At the latest assessed value, annual payments on those are expected to drop to just $24 million, far short of the $54 million needed to service the debt.\nThe cut comes months after East Rutherford had already lowered the mall\u2019s value by $800 million to $2.5 billion, a move that had dropped PILOT payments to $36.5 million, already insufficient to cover interest due. The bond trustee had to dip into reserves last year and with just $38 million left as of December, the math isn\u2019t in investors\u2019 favor.\nOwner Triple Five Group has appealed tax assessments going back to 2019, citing the pandemic\u2019s drag on performance. Its lawyers argued East Rutherford\u2019s appraisals were inflated by flawed methodology and unfair comps. They claimed American Dream had been valued higher than a batch of top-tier malls and even Six Flags Great Adventure combined.\n\nBondholders are exposed to valuation cuts and structural quirks in PILOT financing. The bonds don\u2019t technically default if payments fall short. Instead, balloon maturities originally scheduled from 2027 to 2050 can be pushed out as far as 2056. If they\u2019re still unpaid, holders are out of luck.\nTriple Five opened the 3.5 million-square-foot mall in late 2019, just months before the onset of the pandemic tanked its outlook. The project has since limped along through missed projections, lawsuits and looming debt. A $1.7 billion construction loan matures next year, adding to the pile.\nFor now, American Dream\u2019s tax victory buys time for its owners, but investors dreaming of a smooth ride just woke up to a harsher reality.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "\u201cFreeze the rent,\u201d half a million New York City registered Democrats said in June, when they ranked mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani high on their primary ballots, making him the nominee and quite possibly the next mayor.\nA debate on whether government should control how much renters pay once seemed settled: No, economists agreed \u2014 it leads to too many\nmarket distortions\n. But this primary\ncracked it open\nagain, bringing political and social rationale to bear against the economic argument, thanks to voters who find the city unaffordable and the current administration\u2019s emphasis on business friendliness unpalatable.\nAfter flirting with some price controls early in the 20th century, New York formalized rent control after World War II to address a shortage of affordable apartments, and rent stabilization in 1969. Over the following decades, the program shrunk, following amendments that let landlords deregulate units, until its 2019 expansion, when a state law did away with most methods for leaving stabilization, preserving the 1 million units left in\nstabilization\n.\nThe Real Deal\nasked leaders on each side of the issue to put their best case forward, in a new magazine feature called The Debate. Kenny Burgos, a former state Assembly member and CEO of the New York Apartment Association, a group of property owners and managers, argues no to controls on rent. Cea Weaver, who represents tenants at the New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice for All, and was on the ground for rent-freeze policies during the primary, says yes.\nNO!\nKenny Burgos\nCEO, the New York Apartment Association\nNew York City\u2019s affordable housing crisis is largely driven by a lack of supply. The 2023 Housing and Vacancy Survey found a vacancy rate of just 1.4 percent \u2014 functionally zero. But older rent-stabilized buildings provide the majority of affordable housing in New York City.\nMost economists agree that rent control schemes reduce incentives to build housing. Decades of research shows that strict price controls suppress new construction unless offset by strong pro-housing policies.\nIn New York, rent stabilization has become a major barrier to addressing housing supply because it is unusually rigid and regressive. Since 1974, the city has declared a \u201chousing emergency\u201d every three years based on a vacancy rate below 5%. This is necessary, under the law, to keep rent stabilization in place, and local politicians treat each renewal as a success.\u00a0 But low vacancy keeps the emergency going, and the policy discourages new housing, keeping vacancy low.\nThis system is a global outlier. Nowhere else are rent controls structured to rely on chronic scarcity. A healthy vacancy rate \u2014 between 8 percent and 10 percent \u2014 empowers tenants by giving them more choices and bargaining power. This should be the goal of the city.\n\u201cThis system is a global outlier. Nowhere else are rent controls structured to rely on chronic scarcity.\u201d\nAustin, Texas, is a case in point. Rapid population growth sparked a construction boom that increased housing options and pushed rents down, even for high-quality apartments.\nIn Austin, a modern three-bedroom, two-bath apartment in a desirable neighborhood rents for around $2,650. In Manhattan, a comparable unit would rent for $8,000 to $10,000.\nNew York\u2019s rent control rules are also uniquely hostile to long-term investment. It is the only system in the U.S. that doesn\u2019t guarantee rent increases in line with inflation. Even the recently passed \u201cgood cause eviction,\u201d which is a form of rent control on more expensive market-rate units, guarantees a minimum increase of 5 percent plus inflation.\nOver the past decade, the Rent Guidelines Board has approved rent adjustments roughly 1 percent below inflation annually, while property taxes have steadily risen. This has meant shrinking revenue for building owners, which threatens the financial health of older housing stock.\nCurrently, privately owned rent-stabilized buildings operate with roughly half the funding of similar NYCHA buildings, and do so with better quality.\n\nOther places have more balanced rent control schemes. In California, rent boards are required to adjust for inflation, and property tax increases can be passed through to tenants. In Minnesota, landlords can raise rents by 3 percent, with appeals up to 8 percent if operating costs rise.\nBecause New York\u2019s rent policy is structurally tied to scarcity, the city will never see abundant housing under the current approach. If New York City is serious about creating affordable housing, it must increase supply.\nYES!\nCea Weaver\nDirector of New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice For All\nH\nomes should be for rest, family and community. But for the real estate industry, \u201chousing\u201d is an investment vehicle. Profit comes first and a place for New Yorkers to live well is a distant concern.\nA system that relies on the profit motive, as ours does, leads to horrendous housing outcomes. The profit incentive produces an endless appetite to hike rents, reduce spending on repairs and maintenance, and pursue eviction. Our neighborhoods become less unaffordable, and housing instability threatens our collective ability to access education, healthcare and employment.\nRent stabilization is a proven policy that can interrupt this vicious cycle and keep our communities stable and whole, while balancing the need for buildings to cash-flow in order to function as housing.\nUnder New York City\u2019s current rent stabilization system, renters have the right to renew their leases to predictable and regular rent adjustments and to pass their unit onto their family members. This basic set of rights engenders higher-quality housing, as tenants can request repairs free from the fear of retaliatory eviction, and they do so, research shows.\nRent stabilization encourages affordability without direct government subsidy. Over 2.4 million tenants live in rent-stabilized apartments, including 37 percent of low-income households, triple the number in public housing and subsidized housing.\n\u201cRent stabilization is a proven policy that can interrupt this vicious cycle and keep our communities stable and whole, while balancing the need for buildings to cash-flow in order to function as housing.\u201d\nAs the federal government threatens to cut housing subsidies like Section 8, protecting and expanding rent stabilization is more important than ever.\nRent-control policies ensure generational stability without homeownership. Stable rents allow tenants to build lives without constant fear of eviction or sudden rent spikes, promoting vibrant communities and a healthy housing market.\nThere is a wide acceptance that predictable costs are a good thing and a healthy component of a functioning market. It\u2019s why, for example, property owners benefit from fixed-rate mortgages. Renters should have access to the same stability, especially as homeownership \u2014 always a myth, but a potent one \u2014 becomes unattainable for millions.\nImportantly, rent stabilization leads to civic participation. Housing stability means tenants vote at higher rates, and annual rent board hearings give us a clear stake in local politics. It creates the political conditions necessary to expand housing supply and truly solve our housing crisis.\nWhen renters, a solid political majority in New York City, know that they are safe from sudden rent hikes or no-fault eviction, they are more likely to join a coalition in support of more housing production. Study after study, from California to New Jersey, shows that measures to increase housing supply and regulate rents can work hand in hand to address the housing crisis.\nLandlords and developers fearmonger because rent control cuts down on their profit. But we know the benefits are clear. For over 100 years, rent stabilization has been the backbone of New York City, ensuring that the cooks, nurses, and bus drivers who keep our city running are able to stay.",

By dropping the casino bid, they were able to secure a zoning change to build a little less housing than originally planned and avoid paying outright for a $2 billion platform over the railyards, which they need to develop.\nThe loss, as it went, was a win for the developers (though not for their casino partner, Wynn Resorts).\n\u201cIt became clear that a plan with a gaming resort could not get the votes needed,\u201d a Related\u00a0 spokesperson said. \u201cWe had to get creative.\u201d\nThere are eight firms competing (see\nCalculating the Odds\n) in perhaps the most contentious real estate project the city\u2019s ever seen, and New York is finally set to choose three for downstate casino licenses by the end of the year. Among other peculiarities, the selection process makes no guarantee of a casino in Manhattan, and if the going wisdom is correct that the two current slot parlors in the running (MGM\u2019s Empire City Casino in Yonkers and Genting\u2019s Resorts World in Queens) are likely to win, there\u2019s really just one license up for grabs. The list of developers vying for it includes big New York City real estate names: SL Green Realty, Soloviev Group, Silverstein Properties, Mets owner Steve Cohen and Thor Equities. For years, they\u2019ve\none-upped\neach other with promises of what they\u2019d bring if they won, mostly oodles of affordable housing and tons of jobs, while facing the fact that residents, elected officials, community groups and whole industries oppose the entire endeavor.\nBut if the competition began as a zero-sum game that threatened to leave the\nlosers\nwith years worth of time and money seemingly wasted, Related\u2019s moves hinted that the pay line had changed.\nAs the contest heads into its most critical stage and five contenders prepare for defeat, other teams have followed suit in revealing backup plans. The process of meeting with community members and elected officials, as well as thinking deeply about the demands of a particular site, has fostered new ideas for the would-be casino properties; some seem more palatable to elected officials and community members than a casino. If plans move forward, New York City might win more housing and economic development than it bet on.\nBut not all the developers have their chips on plan B. Some are steadfast that for their sites, it\u2019s casino or bust.\nT\nhe thick of it\nWhen Related dropped out of the running for a casino license, the race lost a sophisticated competitor.\nIn mathematical terms, that increases the odds for the other teams, especially those pitching casinos in Manhattan.\nBut the odds are not just about how many are playing; neighborhood politics affect each proposal\u2019s chances. A five- to six-member Community Advisory Committee, made up of local elected officials or their appointees, has to review every casino plan. That means, in some cases, the same City Council member and borough president \u2014 Bottcher and Mark Levine, respectively \u2014 who disapproved of Related\u2019s casino will have appointees reviewing the other Manhattan bids.\nIn order to advance to the final stage of the competition, a casino proposal needs two-thirds of the advisory committee to approve it.\n\u201cIf we lose, I will be able to sleep good at night, because I will have lost based on good governance and compliance\nwith all the rules and regulations.\u201d\nMichael Hershman, Soloviev Group\nSome members have been less shy about where they stand than others, including Manhattan Sen. Liz Krueger, whose appointee, Assembly member Richard Gottfried, sits on the committee considering SL Green\u2019s proposal. Krueger doesn\u2019t think Manhattan needs a casino. Gottfried is also Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s appointee on the CAC reviewing Silverstein Properties\u2019 $7 billion casino complex planned for a vacant site at 41st Street and 11th Avenue. Hoylman-Sigal has also spoken out against casinos in the borough.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be able to please everyone. We understand that,\u201d\nMichael Hershman\n, CEO of Soloviev Group, said when asked how his team plans to win over the committee\u2019s naysayers. \u201cWhen you try to do anything in New York City, you can never get a unanimous group together to support it.\u201d\nAs of the end of July, six of the applicants had made an initial presentation to their respective advisory committees. These groups will vote on the proposals by Sept. 30, and those approved will go on to the final round of the competition before the state Gaming Facility Location Board.\nT\nhe bright side\nOne side effect of the drawn-out casino process was that it revealed community opposition early and gave developers a chance to modify plans.\nIn Related\u2019s case, the firm was contending with a 2009 rezoning in Hudson Yards that called for builders to add 5,800 residential units, with 300 set aside as affordable.\nBut when the firm unveiled its proposal to change the zoning and include a casino in the Western Railyards, the company proposed a fraction of that, just 1,500 residential units total, with roughly the same affordable set aside. As the company drew closer to a City Council vote on its proposed modifications, Related upped the ante.\nIt also pitched using surplus payment in lieu of taxes to pay for a $2 billion platform over the active railyards. Doing so would allow the company to replace one of the office towers in its plan with two residential buildings. By the time the Council approved the project, Related dropped the casino and increased the number of housing units to up to 4,000 housing units, including at least 625 affordable apartments. Related\u2019s spokesperson said that\ngetting to this plan\nrequired cooperation from community members and elected officials.\nThe changes won over one of the project\u2019s fiercest critics, the Friends of the High Line, which had feared the casino complex would loom over its namesake park.\n\u201cThis was a win for the community and also for Related and a reminder of what\u2019s possible when community voices are heard,\u201d Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Friends of the High Line, said in a statement.\n\nOther applicants may be able to use the negative reactions to their casino proposals to bolster alternative plans or at least build up local rapport.\nThe Soloviev Group team, for example, removed a Ferris wheel from its proposal at the community\u2019s urging.\nSoloviev\u2019s Hershman believes his team, which includes Mohegan, has also\nearned goodwill\nwith the community by vowing to not make any campaign contributions to elected officials who have sway over the license.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to see politics driving this decision. They want to see merit driving this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we lose, I will be able to sleep good at night, because I will have lost based on good governance and compliance with all the rules and regulations.\u201d\nIf they don\u2019t score the license, Soloviev doesn\u2019t plan to leave its 6.5-acre plot near the United Nations vacant. The developer previously planned three condo towers and an office building on the site, which had faced community pushback.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you at this moment if we\u2019ll build a commercial tower,\u201d Hershman said. \u201cAnd frankly, the studies that we\u2019ve done show that the traffic increase would be greater if we go back to the original plan, than the [casino] plan we\u2019re proposing now.\u201d\nT\nhe holdouts\nFew applicants will acknowledge the possibility of alternative plans for their casino sites. Steve Cohen has insisted that 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field will remain asphalt if Metropolitan Park, the $8 billion casino complex he has proposed with Hard Rock International, is not realized.\nSL Green hasn\u2019t disclosed what will become of its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway if it isn\u2019t transformed into a $4 billion casino complex. In March, S&amp;P Global raised concerns that the building \u201cmay not be competitive in its current state\u201d and will require $68 million worth of work to become marketable, Crain\u2019s reported.\nSilverstein Properties\u2019 proposed casino site is at West 41st Street and 11th Avenue. It has floated and abandoned plans for condo and\ncommercial uses\nhere over the years. If the firm doesn\u2019t get the casino license, the site will remain vacant, Silverstein COO Dino Fusco said.\n\u201cThis giant hole in the ground has been there for quite some time.\u201d\nDino Fusco, Silverstein Properties\n\u201cThis giant hole in the ground has been there for quite some time,\u201d he said.\nHe doesn\u2019t see alternatives, adding, \u201cI wish there was. If there was, we would\u2019ve pursued it over the last 10 years that we owned the site.\u201d\nThor Equities\u2019 Peter McEneaney said \u201cthe Coney,\u201d its $3.4 billion casino proposal envisioned for a 5-acre stretch of beachfront between the Maimonides Park baseball stadium and Luna Park, is the only economic catalyst for turning Coney Island into a year-round destination.\n\u201cConey Island is a special place, but it has definitely fallen on hard times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to correct that is a generational type project like this.\u201d\nSome think that a lack of a contingency plan could backfire, however.\n\u201cThe fact that they do not have a Plan B if they don\u2019t win the casino license is hurting their chances, honestly,\u201d one source familiar with casino negotiations said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cBecause the community feels like, well, if they don\u2019t [get] the casino they want then they\u2019re just gonna let their land sit vacant for another 15 years.\u201d\nF\ninal stretch\nJust a few days before the Community Advisory Committee meetings began, the City Council seemed to deliver a death blow to Bally\u2019s Bronx casino proposal.\nThe Council voted down the company\u2019s proposal seeking zoning changes needed to turn a portion of the city-owned golf course at Bally\u2019s Golf Links into a $4 billion casino complex.\nThen, in late July, Mayor Eric Adams told The Real Deal he\u2019d veto the decision to \u201cre-level the playing field and allow the Bronx to have a seat at the table.\u201d The decision now goes back to the City Council, which will need two-thirds of the vote to override the mayor\u2019s veto, and then be reviewed and voted on by a Community Advisory Committee by the Sept. 30 deadline.\nWithout the casino license, Bally\u2019s would remain a golf course, just as the slot parlors run by Resorts World NYC in Jamaica, Queens, and MGM Resorts in Yonkers would continue on as gaming facilities.\u00a0 (The slot parlors have long been considered favorites for two of the three licenses up for grabs.)\nOnce the advisory committees decide what applications will survive, the state Gaming Facility Locations Board will select the winners.\nBy the end of the year, New Yorkers will know where casinos will rise downstate. The owners of the other five sites will walk away, though if they build anyway, it might not be clear who\u2019s won and who\u2019s lost the gamble.",

        "content": "Alex Witkoff isn\u2019t like the other real estate heirs.\nHe\u2019s young but not as bright-eyed as Brandon and Kyle Lutnick, the 20-something sons of Howard Lutnick, who earlier this year took over as Commerce Secretary and appointed the two as the heads of the parent company that controls Cantor Fitzgerald and Newmark Group.\nAlex is early in his career but no novice. Now that his father,\nSteve Witkoff\n, is Special Envoy to the Middle East, the son\u2019s decade-long schooling at the family\u2019s development company, the Witkoff Group, is apparently over. Steve, out to firewall his peacemaking duties, put Alex, his co-CEO of two years, in the driver\u2019s seat. They say Alex can\u2019t call for advice in a pinch or even talk business at dinner.\nThat makes him unlike the Kushner and Trump inheritors, who during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration faced criticism over dealings that tangled business and governance. (A cryptocurrency venture run by Alex\u2019s brother Zach and championed by the administration brushes closer to conflict-of-interest territory.)\nAnd, in a business where generations make, lose, rebuild and lose again their family\u2019s fortunes, Alex also hasn\u2019t shown signs of wayward son impulses, like Stefan Soloviev with his grain train in Kansas or his brother Zach. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to different pastures,\u201d Zach told The Real Deal.\nAlex, rather, is a real businessman, a father\u2019s dream \u2014 smart, prepped and trained for a job leading expensive top-of-the-line projects in the nation\u2019s most competitive markets \u2014 and thus far he\u2019s managed to sidestep the spotlight, keep disasters out of the press and avoid embarrassment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of responsibility that comes with it,\u201d Alex said mildly from a chair overlooking the courtyard of the Witkoffs\u2019 One High Line. He wore all navy blue: pants, a short-sleeve collared shirt with white trim and sneakers, taking refuge in the building\u2019s air conditioning on a recent hot afternoon. \u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a good age and in my 30s, where I have tremendous energy, and we have a great team of people.\u201d\nThose who\u2019ve worked with Steve for decades say they\u2019re confident Alex has the chops to carry the business forward while his dad\u2019s off saving the world. By the end of last year, Witkoff Group\u2019s One High Line surpassed $1 billion in sales, while at South Florida\u2019s the\nShore Club\n, the penthouse reportedly scored a contract for $120 million, which would be a record deal for a condo in Miami-Dade County. The company took both projects over after foreclosures on HFZ Capital, the original developer.\nYet in an industry that worships an archetype of developer as skyline-shaping cowboy armed with nothing but chutzpah and a vision, he\u2019s an heir apparent who runs spreadsheets where his dad once strapped a handgun to his ankle, who opts for reputational management over devil-may-care audacity and defaults to reticence instead of charm.\nPerhaps his way is emblematic of a new generation rising in the ranks, one born to privilege, educated in the Ivy League and steeped in the idea of protecting a legacy created by someone more bombastic.\n\u201cHe worked hard, started from nothing and built something great,\u201d Alex said of his dad. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything to apologize for. I think that\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d\nBut maybe the smarts, attention to detail and number crunching carry their own risk: The pilot who can land a plane perfectly can\u2019t always imagine its next adventure. Alex thinks of development largely in terms of dollars and cents, he said in interviews, and though sources say his passion comes through in the creation of top-tier projects, especially their aesthetic details, he doesn\u2019t appear to be in it for the glory.\nO\nut of the ring\nWhen Alex was about 9, he didn\u2019t want to join the family business, his younger brother Zach remembered. \u201cI think he wanted to be a lawyer, actually.\u201d\nTo be fair, the scions felt mostly free to choose their own paths, Zach said, as long as they showed up at the top of their game.\nBut they also knew that their father wanted to pass the torch. He never sought to be \u201csome sort of old boxer,\u201d he told TRD in 2017.\n\u201cAny smart company is always thinking about succession,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we planned for it to happen exactly on November 5, 2024\u201d \u2014 the day Donald Trump won his re-election and Steve\u2019s path toward the administration came into focus.\nThe surprise element was a non-factor, if you ask the Witkoffs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hard call for me because I knew the business was in good hands,\u201d Steve\nsaid\nat\nTRD\n\u2019s New York Forum in May.\nSteve always said learning the job should start from the bottom, Zach recalled. His first role at Witkoff, when he was in high school, was at a nonunion construction team, working on one of the firm\u2019s rental properties on West 95th Street and Columbus Avenue.\n\u201cSteve can just charm you and bring you into this Steve magic. Alex is not so interested in that. They get the same thing accomplished, but they do it in different ways.\u201d\nPam Liebman, corcoran\nBut Alex,\u00a0who officially joined in 2015\u00a0after a stint at Morgan Stanley,\u00a0started out as executive vice president with hands in the firm\u2019s acquisitions and development departments. At the time, Witkoff was working on the Edition in West Hollywood, and Alex got his apprenticeship in\u00a0groundup\u00a0development there.\nFor both Witkoff brothers, the stakes were clear from the outset: Play your cards right, and the world\u2019s your oyster. Don\u2019t, and risk losing everything. Steve called it \u201cprotecting your downside.\u201d\nIn the last year or two, Zach left the company to run the family\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, with Eric Trump and Don Jr., which had raised $550 million through the sale of its \u201cgovernance tokens\u201d by March of this year. It doesn\u2019t appear to have affected his relationship with his brother. Zach lives just a seven-minute drive from Alex in a house on Miami Beach, with his wife and their newborn son, named Don James after the president. Alex visits frequently.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like me and Alex compete at all,\u201d Zach said. \u201cTo be honest with you, he was always much better at structuring real estate deals than I was.\u201d\nT\nhe crown\nThree years after Alex joined Witkoff Group, the company doubled down on South Florida following a pullback from the state in the wake of the financial crisis.\nIn 2021, developer Ari Pearl brought Steve, a known golf enthusiast, in on Shell Bay, a mixed-use condo, hotel and golf course project in Hallandale Beach. Alex has worked with Pearl on the development since then, as his father promoted him to co-CEO shortly after its inception. He tackled the day-to-day operations of the company, while Steve focused on the big-picture relationships.\nWitkoff also took over what became the Shore Club on Miami Beach after Witkoff\u2019s partner, Monroe Capital, foreclosed on the property, the development of which was canceled by Ziel Feldman and his now-defunct firm, HFZ Capital, in 2018.\nSince Witkoff\u2019s turn back to South Florida, \u201cI\u2019ve dealt much more with Alex than Steve,\u201d Niesen Kasdin, a former mayor of Miami Beach and now attorney and lobbyist, said. He\u2019s known Steve since before the Great Recession.\nBut Kasdin\u2019s first impression of Alex wasn\u2019t great. He thought the developer seemed young and arrogant, a new guy attempting to appear bigger than his britches.\n\u201cHe was very sure of himself and assertive about his ambitions,\u201d Kasdin said.\nHis notions changed once the two started on the details.\n\n\u201cAfter you work with him, you realize he is really that smart, and he really has a clear thought about what he\u2019s doing and how things should be handled,\u201d Kasdin said.\nAt the Shore Club, Alex ran the approval process for the building. It was arduous, according to Monroe Capital\u2019s Kyle Asher. Alex got\u00a0 the project through relatively unscathed, Asher said, even as it faced opposition from the neighboring Setai Resort and Residences.\nAsher credits Alex with bringing Auberge on as the hotel brand to anchor the Shore Club. Asher added that on One High Line in New York City, where they are also partners, Alex led sales and construction.\nAll the preparation meant that when November \u201924 arrived, Alex was already leading most of the firm\u2019s ongoing projects and had become the new point person for many of Steve\u2019s longtime contacts.\n\u201cWhat I do on a daily basis really didn\u2019t materially change all that much,\u201d Craig Murphy, the executive vice president of the firm\u2019s construction department, said. Murphy has worked with Steve since his days running Stellar Management with the late Larry Gluck; the two built a rental portfolio in the Bronx and Harlem before Steve went out on his own.\nB\nrick wall\nPut Alex in front of a crowd, and the accolades seem to exit stage left. In May, he sat by his father at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea at\nTRD\n\u2019s annual forum, on a panel about succession at the firm.\nAs the interview went on,\nTRD\n\u2019s publisher Amir Korangy noted that father and son were sticking to a script, and Steve was doing most of the talking.\n\u201cAlex, you can\u2019t give me a canned response,\u201d Korangy said, addressing the heir. \u201cI want your real, honest response.\u201d\nAlex keeps a tight grip on his image. He and Zach were raised to care about presentation: Important meetings warranted shaved faces and clean suits. Promising something meant following through. He\u2019d tell the kids: \u201cBe a man people can count on.\u201d\nPress coverage of Alex has stayed limited to one-off news about deals, project achievements and charitable contributions. A Google alert with his name turns up almost no results. Scheduling time with Alex and even connecting with others who know him was an exercise in getting the runaround. He canceled a photoshoot hours before start time because he hadn\u2019t brought a suit and didn\u2019t want to be pictured without one. When the sit-down with\nTRD\nfinally occurred, he tiptoed around such questions as the last time he, his brother and his dad were in the same room together; his most recent padel partners; and his personal strengths as a developer.\n\u201cMy job now is to be well rounded. It\u2019s not to be one dimensional,\u201d he finally said of his strengths.\nHis control extends to his dealings with agents.\n\u201cOf all the developers I\u2019ve ever worked with, and I don\u2019t say that lightly, he is the most present, in the sense that he\u2019s almost weirdly obsessed with what we do as real estate agents,\u201d Fredrik Eklund, co-founder of the top-producing Eklund-Gomes team at Douglas Elliman, said.\nEklund worked with Alex at Shell Bay and the Shore Club; Eklund purchased a unit at Shore Club. He described Alex as being \u201cintimately involved\u201d with not just every agent on the sales team, but even those who bring prospective buyers into the building.\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling me, \u2018Why hasn\u2019t so-and-so at Corcoran been at the sales office in the last month?\u2019\u201d Eklund said. \u201cThen he calls that person and says, \u2018Why haven\u2019t you done a deal?\u00a0 I thought you were so great. You haven\u2019t done a deal at one of my buildings lately.\u201d\nEklund characterized Alex as demanding. He\u2019s decisive, moved by results, not emotions. It\u2019s not personal, but \u201cif you\u2019re not producing, you\u2019re out,\u201d Eklund said. He doesn\u2019t befriend people he works with, he told Eklund.\nBut he\u2019s on the frontlines of reshaping Miami Beach. The firm\u2019s track record of iconic developments like 150 Charles in New York, where a financier just flipped his unit for $60 million \u2014 nearly double its purchase price \u2014 attracts the motivated.\nOne place Alex will admit he shines (others agree) is working with the City of Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board.\nThe board, whose decisions can make or break a project, holds rigorous standards, and plans often go through numerous rounds before they\u2019re greenlit. Alex spent a lot of time there in \u201921 and \u201922, when the Shore Club needed approval.\n\u201cPretty much every single discussion, every single community meeting, every single board hearing, every single thing, I personally became very involved in,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we call it a binary outcome. If you get approved, great. If you don\u2019t, not good.\u201d\nBut he wasn\u2019t done with the board after Shore Club\u2019s happy outcome. Moving to Miami Beach in 2020 earned him points with the preservation commission, which now trusts that he\u2019s embedded in the community, and the city even appointed him to the Ad Hoc Preservation Advisory Committee, a cohort of private sector members tasked with updating Miami Beach\u2019s preservation rules.\nA\nlex in his image\nAlex\u2019s ironclad walls might seem unusual for executives of his generation, who\u2019ve grown up alongside social media, their personal and professional lives displayed for mass consumption. Unless it\u2019s the opposite: a Gen Z attempt to edit and curate real life as if it were Instagram. Or, perhaps, in Alex\u2019s case, wanting control of his identity has a more timeless root \u2014 a son\u2019s reaction to having to fill his father\u2019s mammoth shoes in a risky industry where a couple bad moments can destroy it all.\nEveryone, including Alex, gets that Alex isn\u2019t Steve. He lacks Steve\u2019s signature magnetism, and his thinking is more methodical, step by step rather than top down. He\u2019s less interested in blurring the line between friends, clients and employees.\nBut being a carbon copy of his father isn\u2019t his aspiration, according to Corcoran CEO Pam Liebman, whose new development marketing firm is heading sales at One High Line. It\u2019s a dynamic Liebman is familiar with as the woman who stepped up after the legendary Barbara Corcoran.\nSteve is \u201cone of the greatest schmoozers of all time,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cSteve can just charm you and bring you into this Steve magic. Alex is not so interested in that. They get the same thing accomplished, but they do it in different ways.\u201d\nAlex is going to continue to build, he said, \u201cin the areas I think we\u2019re known for, whether it\u2019s purchasing distressed debt, taking over complex scenarios, new condominium projects and hospitality projects.\u201d He will also remain on the hunt for golf-related projects.\nBut his list of new frontiers is short and conservative: introducing new technology and looking for opportunities with data centers.

        "content": "Even though the\nHamptons\ncan feel like a million miles \u2014 and dollars \u2014 away from the rest of the market, its residential scene couldn\u2019t avoid the same pitfalls as the rest of the country.\nThe year was off to a\nhot start\nfor the brokerages that rule Out East, but that was cut short by tariffs, stubborn interest rates and political instability.\n\u201cWe were really expecting 2025 to sort of be our climb back into a really strong market after the last couple of years,\u201d said Joe Fuer, Compass managing director in the Hamptons.\nInstead, after a first quarter that saw a number of firms posting double-digit year-over-year gains, the second quarter is where \u201cthings start to come undone,\u201d according to Andrew Saunders, the president of Saunders &amp; Associates.\nLow inventory and high interest rates continued to be bugaboos, and President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in mid-April added to the pressure on the market.\n\u201cWe did have a few deals that were almost at the finish line, and the buyers just lost confidence and didn\u2019t go through with those deals,\u201d Fuer said.\nA number of firms managed to post improved numbers from June 2024 to June 2025, as the top 10 brokerages racked up $10.2 billion across 2,580 deals. In the previous 12-month period, the top 10 firms had a sales volume of $7.3 billion across 1,830 deals. The rankings are based on\u00a0 both buy- and sell-side transactions over $1 million in that one-year period from publicly available listings and data provided by brokerages.\nWith more deals to go around, there was also more movement in the rankings. Compass, which posted $2.18 billion across 585 deals, knocked off Douglas Elliman\u2019s two-year reign as the top brokerage in the Hamptons. Elliman did $2.16 billion across 593 deals \u2014 good enough for second place.\n\u201cThere\u2019s basically 1,450 listings for sale, and we have over 2,000 brokers out here \u2014 you can imagine what a free-for-all it is.\u201d\nAndrew Saunders, Saunders &amp; Associates\nCorcoran jumped from fourth to third with about $1.5 billion across 383 deals, switching places with Saunders &amp; Associates, which did nearly $1.4 billion in sales across 426 deals. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty rounded out the top five with more than $1 billion in sales across 228 deals.\nThe top five brokerages changed places, but the same names managed to hold on to their status as the leading firms despite a number of new entrants to the market since the pandemic.\nSerhant and the Modlin Group were among the Manhattan-based brokerages that opened their own shops in the region, and a franchise under the Los Angeles-based Agency brand debuted in 2023.\n\u201cThose brokerages that came out here are still out here,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Todd Bourgard, the CEO of the brokerage\u2019s Long Island, Hamptons and North Fork regions. \u201cOf course, it changes the dynamic in the sense that they\u2019re taking a piece of the pie.\u201d\nBut Corcoran CEO Pam Liebman said that these new entrants may have a tough time making meaningful waves in the market if they\u2019re not careful about establishing local boots on the ground. The Hamptons, in her experience, aren\u2019t plug and play.\n\u201cSometimes brokers want to open in markets that have a high publicity value and sexy, expensive deals,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just splashing cash. It\u2019s a real business, and these are real homes for a lot of people.\u201d\nLuxury sales take the lead\nAs the summer of 2024 faded into the fall, residential brokerages in the Hamptons were trudging toward the end of the year. By the time December rolled around, the enclave\u2019s dossier of top deals was significantly lower than the previous year, with the 10 most expensive sales totaling $327 million compared to $511 million in 2023.\nAlthough the deal volume was lower at the very top, \u201cthe luxury segment was still really pushing that market along, of course, because it\u2019s less affected by higher interest rates,\u201d said Liebman.\nLiebman added that the lower end of the market struggled to keep pace, as buyers in that range are more susceptible to the pains that come with high mortgage rates and many of them plan to use their properties as investments, \u201cmaybe rent it out for a month or so.\u201d\n\u201cThe rental market was only okay, not amazing,\u201d she added.\nBut \u201cthe tone really shifted\u201d as 2024 turned to 2025, Liebman said. Within the first two months of the year, the Hamptons logged a $70 million deal for a waterfront estate in Amagansett. The 7-acre property at 370 and 372 Further Lane traded in two transactions after hitting the market last summer for $89 million, with brokers from Elliman and Sotheby\u2019s International brokering the sale.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a greater number of those so-called big money buyers right now floating around in the Hamptons,\u201d said Saunders.\nThe sale of a sprawling, half-built estate in Southampton closed in December for $40 million. The property at 1320 Meadow Lane had been on the market since 2018, when the seller halted construction plans. The listing was a co-exclusive with Corcoran\u2019s Tim Davis and Bespoke Real Estate, which ranked seventh with about $536 million across 48 deals.\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve seen more realistic seller expectations,\u201d said Bespoke co-founder Cody Vichinsky. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through the motions of trying to sell over the last several years in a high-rate, high- volatility environment\u201d to no avail. \u201cNow you\u2019re starting to see deals happen.\u201d\n\u201cOnce prices came down to a point where buyers recognize value, that\u2019s when they transacted,\u201d said Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nanette Hansen.\nThe broker cited the $29 million sale of 623 Halsey Neck Lane in Southampton, which dropped its asking price from $52 million to $34 million in April. Sotheby\u2019s Harald Grant and Corcoran\u2019s Tim Davis co-listed the property.\nAside from seller flexibility, Vichinsky said that buyers are also starting to pull the trigger on homes they\u2019ve been eyeing as they come to terms with a market that\u2019s still \u201ccompressed\u201d by a lack of inventory.\nDespite a few top-dollar deals at the start of the year, the Hamptons is still yearning for a nine-figure sale, which it hasn\u2019t seen since 2023, when Vichinsky\u2019s listing at 700 Meadow Lane closed for $112 million.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made many nine-figure offers this year,\u201d Vichinsky said. \u201cNobody wants to take it.\u201d\nThe Hamptons is a discretionary market, which means many of the homes bought and sold across the towns and hamlets on the East End are people\u2019s second, third, fourth or 10th property. Sellers typically don\u2019t have to part with their assets unless there\u2019s \u201cdivorce or distress,\u201d as Vichinsky put it.\n\u201cFrankly, [they] don\u2019t need the money,\u201d Vichinsky said.\nAn agent \u201cfree-for-all\u201d\nSeveral managers cited low inventory numbers as an issue that has continued to plague the Hamptons, bringing more competition for fewer listings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s basically 1,450 listings for sale, and we have over 2,000 brokers out here \u2014 you can imagine what a free-for-all it is,\u201d Saunders said.\nSome brokerages have responded by seeking new recruits from competitors, leading to a number of high-profile agents swapping shops.\n\u201cMy agents are getting calls from everybody out there every day,\u201d Fuer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very competitive.\u201d\nTwo of Elliman\u2019s top agents, mother-daughter duo Michaela and Paulina Keszler, left the brokerage for Sotheby\u2019s in December. Michaela Keszler placed 15th in\nTRD\n\u2019s latest ranking of the top agents in the Hamptons.\nAt the start of the summer, Terry Cohen, who previously led one of the top-producing teams at Hedgerow, jumped from the boutique brokerage to Compass. She joined the Hamptons\u2019 leading brokerage as an independent agent, leaving behind the remaining members of her team.\nIn July, Yorgos Tsibiridis, who\u2019d spent more than a decade at Compass in the Hamptons, jumped to Sotheby\u2019s as well.\nHansen said she thinks the added competition will only help in the long run.\n\u201cHaving more competition out here ultimately benefits sellers and landlords,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pie is big enough for all of us, and I think the cream rises to the top.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "A\u00a0new white brick office building sits vacant on a neglected corner of East 121st Street and Third Avenue in East Harlem, its front doors locked on a recent Friday. Six miles south, orange construction barricades and a chain link fence surround another boutique office development that is nearing completion and now seeking tenants.\nThese two buildings appear to be all that\u2019s left of Brandon Miller\u2019s family-owned real estate development company, Real Estate Equities Corporation, a year after his tragic death. Miller\u2019s July 3, 2024, suicide at his estate in the Hamptons exposed not only a\npersonal drama\nbut a tangled web of debts and real estate deals gone bad.\nWhile Miller\u2019s financial and legal problems grabbed headlines last summer and fall, his partner at REEC, Mark Seigel, remained silent. A password to REEC\u2019s website hid the firm\u2019s real estate projects from public view. Current and past employees, as well as brokers and lenders associated with projects, all declined to answer questions a full year later.\nBut some movement at the sites \u2014 construction, leasing efforts and loan transactions \u2014 gives a hint of how the company\u2019s strategic shift from residential and commercial building to an almost exclusive focus on office projects fared. The\npivot\ncame at a bad time, but the office market has since made a comeback, with new office inventory drying up and companies expanding. It\u2019s unclear whether that recovery came in time for Miller\u2019s projects.\nThe empty buildings, along with new lawsuits and the loss of two Manhattan development sites, add to the intrigue that continues to follow REEC.\nE\nast Harlem life sciences\nThe East Harlem office was REEC\u2019s last project developed before Miller\u2019s death. It has a new lender, but its future remains unclear.\nRaven Capital Management bought the loan secured by 2226 Third Avenue in July from Related Companies. The original loan amount was $40 million, but it is not known how much the investment management firm paid for the loan or how much outstanding debt there is.\n\u201cI think it was a good investment for them and they\u2019re hanging onto it for dear life.\u201d\nLawrence Khedouri, owner of land at REEC\u2019s 2226 Third Avenue office development\nREEC bought the leasehold for the property in 2020 for $27 million and developed a 10-story office building for life sciences tenants. It wrapped up construction on the 130,000-square-foot project in September 2023 and dubbed the development Labs @121. A CBRE team was handling leasing, according to the building\u2019s website.\nBut that website appears to have been taken down. Trash littered the sidewalk on a recent visit and the ground floor was vacant; the upper floors appeared to be vacant too. Seigel did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the building. Land owner Lawrence Khedouri said REEC is up to date on payments.\n\u201cI think it was a good investment for them and they\u2019re hanging onto it for dear life,\u201d Khedouri said.\nB\noutique office\nThere is more to see at an East Village office property developed by REEC, where leasing began early this year.\nWork appears nearly complete at 1 St. Mark\u2019s Place, a nine-story building with wraparound terraces and a curved brick and glass facade on the corner of Third Avenue. A JLL team is handling leasing, according to the building\u2019s website. A JLL spokesperson did not respond to a request for an update on leasing.\nREEC bought the leasehold on the property for $29 million from Edward Gabay and filed plans in 2018 to build a 53,000-square-foot office building entirely on spec. Before foundations were even dug, Madison Capital Realty tried\nforeclosing\non the property in 2021.\n\nParkview Financial rescued the project with a $70 million refinance the following year. At one point, REEC fell behind on loan payments at the project, Parkview Financial CEO Paul Rahimian said last summer. It was unclear whether REEC is currently up to date and Rahimian did not respond to recent requests for comment.\nTo add to REEC\u2019s headaches, the owner of a neighboring multifamily property sued the developer in April for failing to properly underpin the building during construction, allegedly causing \u201csignificant damage.\u201d\nB\nowery blowup\nThat isn\u2019t the only lawsuit REEC has faced since Miller\u2019s death. The owner of a Nolita property once slated for development by REEC sued the developer and its principals for abandoning an ill-fated office project at 156-166 Bowery Street.\nAri Zagdanski\u2019s Kinsmen Property Group\nclaims REEC owes more than $2.9 million in ground rent at the Bowery site, according to a lawsuit filed in March in state Supreme Court. Kinsmen is suing REEC, Seigel and Candice Miller, Brandon\u2019s wife and the\nadministrator of his estate\n.\nSeigel fired back at the lawsuit, claiming in an affidavit that REEC spent $4 million in costs related to architectural, engineering and permitting, and the landlord agreed to either a credit back or a portion of the equity under a new developer.\nREEC took over the leasehold for the 15,000-square-foot assemblage in February 2021 in a deal valued at $50 million and planned to build a six- or seven-story mixed-use office building.\nInstead, REEC failed to pay the ground rent or made partial payments for several months in 2024, Kinsmen\u2019s suit alleges. REEC also bailed on more than $600,000 in real estate taxes, which Kinsmen paid to avoid interest and penalties, the suit alleges. The landlord slapped REEC with a default notice last August and terminated REEC\u2019s ground lease in January.\nH\nighline hell\nAcross town, a long-vacant development site near the High Line\nonce owned\nby Miller recently found a buyer after years of drama surrounding the property.\nToll Brothers is in contract to buy 118 10th Avenue in Chelsea from Benny Barmapov for $53 million, a source familiar with the deal said. The deal comes after Barmapov took the property back from Miller, collapsed the ground lease and put it up for sale.\nREEC\nbought the leasehold\nfrom Barmapov in a January 2017 deal valued at $21 million and planned a 10-story, 100,000-square-foot office building with ground-floor retail. But the office project was never built and the leasehold changed hands again two years later when an entity tied to\nGDS Development Management and Swedish real estate firm Kl\u00f6vern AB\ntook it over.\nThe leasehold was transferred back to Miller in December 2023, and he stopped paying the ground lease in early 2024, Barmapov said.\nBefore his death, Miller\npledged his equity interests\nin the entity controlling the property to a company called DIA Family Holdings. A friend of Miller who lent him $1.5 million secured by Miller\u2019s interest in the property took control of the entity that owns the leasehold on the property and later\nfiled\nfor bankruptcy protection.\nWhen contacted about the pending sale, Barmapov said: \u201cLife goes on. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",

Juul-Hansen is walking the four of us through the property, where the building\u2019s wooden frame cuts a stark figure against the surrounding farmland and tangled web of trees and undergrowth.\nTheir hope is that each decision made since acquiring three adjacent plots of land facing the Long Island Sound in 2022 will justify a sale of what will be the most expensive spec home ever listed on the North Fork.\nJuul-Hansen, whose glasses tend to fall from his forehead to the bridge of his nose as he talks animatedly about one design aspect or another, is the face of the project. He made a name for himself with designs that shaped some of Manhattan\u2019s trophy condo buildings, including\nGary Barnett\u2019s One57 tower on Billionaires\u2019 Row\n.\nThe group rejects the term \u201cspec home,\u201d though most spec developers do. Much of the belief in what they\u2019re doing hinges on Juul-Hansen\u2019s ability to deliver a home that an end-user would have already spent millions on in renovations. Donadic, whose day job is as a high-end general contractor, grew up in the area and has quietly amassed his own impressive real estate portfolio on the North Fork.\n\u201cI know there is not a human being on the planet who could re-create this for the same price that we\u2019re going to sell it for,\u201d he said. (What that price will be is up for debate \u2014 the last estimate the developers offered to The Real Deal was $10 million.)\nJuul-Hansen, who is wiry with intense blue eyes, vacillates from self-deprecation to, in his own words, arrogance. \u201cI\u2019m a very hard critic of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I think we\u2019re making something spectacular, it\u2019s because it\u2019s fucking spectacular.\u201d\nIt is the pair\u2019s first foray into residential development. After years of charging developers for their services, they are now on the other side of the ledger as 50-50 equity partners, with a single construction loan for financing.\nBut aside from themselves, Juul-Hansen and Donadic are also betting on the area as a whole, and that what they\u2019re building will look like a steal come five years from now.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a first,\u201d Juul-Hansen said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that hasn\u2019t been done before, but it should be done.\u201d\nA\ntight squeeze\nIf there is one thing backing up the developers\u2019 bet, it\u2019s the rapidly appreciating value of the land on the North Fork. And how little of it there is to go around.\nThe area, which starts 75 miles east of Manhattan and stretches 30 miles farther in that direction toward Orient Point, has long been known more for its charming cottages and vast acres of farmland than the grand compounds and crowded nightlife of its Southern neighbor, the Hamptons.\nFor a long time, the North Fork\u2019s more chilled reputation extended to its home values, which remained stable as developers rushed to buy up every buildable parcel of land on the South Fork.\nBut as city dwellers fled for greener pastures in the wake of the pandemic\nthe North Fork became a destination in its own right\nand home values skyrocketed from 2020 onward. Juul-Hansen and Donadic seized on the wave of interest, scooping up over 11 acres across three plots for $4 million in 2022, which already looks to be a deal as median home prices have jumped another 22 percent to $1.1 million this year.\n\u201cThe timing was great,\u201d said Juul-Hansen.\n\u201cTwenty-foot ceiling heights does not say humble to me.\u201d\nluxury broker Louis Buckworth, on the planned $10M+ North Fork spec home\nTwo of the plots are waterfront, while the third, where construction on the first home is underway, abuts their southern borders and faces over 32 acres of preserved farmland. (The 7,000-square-foot home will be on the non-waterfront plot, and the group has been cagey about the other two plots \u2014 at the moment, the plan is for Juul-Hansen and Donadic to each take one for personal use.)\nA narrow strip of gravel driveway runs three-quarters of a mile from Oregon Road down to the plots, which Buckworth says \u201cwould be the most immaculate drive\u201d once it\u2019s lined with trees, adding the outside entry to the group\u2019s tendency to talk in superlatives when referring to the home.\nLand like this, zoned residentially, is not easy to come by in the Town of Southold, which has already preserved over 10,000 acres according to the town\u2019s website. Only two residential parcels are currently listed for sale, one of which is less than an acre and neither of which is on the water, according to data provided by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Melissa Principi.\n\n\u201cIf you can find a new build ground-up, it\u2019s rare,\u201d Principi said. \u201cBuyers are willing to pay a premium for brand-new, and I\u2019ve been seeing, for the most part, that it\u2019s working.\u201d\nThe Town of Southold, which spans from Laurel to the tip of the island, has also cracked down on development opportunities as builders have eyed the area\u2019s untouched farmland. In 2022, the town passed a series of zoning reforms limiting the gross floor area by lot size, hamstringing developers looking to go big or fill a plot with multiple homes.\n\u201cEven if you had six acres, most of the time, it would have to stay 70 percent open space,\u201d Principi said. \u201cYou\u2019re really, maybe only going to get two homes if you\u2019re a spec builder on those six acres.\u201d\nA\n\u201chumble\u201d home\nFor Juul-Hansen, there\u2019s no reason to cram the lot that makes up 6023 Oregon Road with as much square footage as possible \u2014 that\u2019s for the Hamptons.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to find a way to fit in by trying to make our work vernacular without making it look like it\u2019s something that was built 200 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have built a 25,000-square-foot house on this lot if we wanted, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the North Fork is about.\u201d (He later clarified this was hyperbole, but that he did not come close to maxing out the allowable floor area).\nThat means balancing out a desire to match the understated nature of the North Fork with building something that is also unrivaled for the area.\nJuul-Hansen in an interview called the project a \u201chumble house,\u201d at which point Buckworth jumped in to clarify the remark.\n\u201cTwenty-foot ceiling heights does not say humble to me,\u201d said Buckworth, a seasoned luxury broker who has led high-end projects like Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 520 Park Avenue. (The ceilings are in fact 22 feet high in the living room.)\n\u201cEven though the dollar amount might be super high because they\u2019re a piece of art, they will fit with the landscape so beautifully and seamlessly,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Sheri Winter Parker, who sold the land to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s what a high-end North Fork buyer is looking for.\u201d\nAt the property, which the team hopes to complete by spring 2026, Juul-Hansen walks through his vision: the glass-doored four-car garage for car aficionados squeezed for space in the city, the double-height living room separated from the kitchen by a two-sided fireplace and the windows by German specialty manufacturer Sch\u00fcco that have just been installed.\nThe property has many similarities to Juul-Hansen\u2019s own home just five minutes away, which he built and moved into in 2022, from the travertine finishes in the bathrooms and pool deck siding to the bleached oak flooring. He is banking on a buyer that doesn\u2019t want \u201cthe show and the scene\u201d of the Hamptons, but \u201cwho may be very, very wealthy.\u201d\n\u201cThey want what I want,\u201d he said of his ideal buyer. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the creative world, like myself, who appreciate that sort of humble setup, even if it is possibly extraordinarily expensive.\u201d\nA\nnew North Fork\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Juul-Hansen\u2019s partner on the project is Donadic, who also has a house in the area and in recent years has laid the groundwork for making the area more palatable to a new class of buyer.\nDonadic, along with a group of local investors, has bought up and revitalized North Fork Table, a farm-to-table restaurant in Southold, and The Shoals, a bayfront 20-room hotel. Juul-Hansen worked on both projects, which have reopened in the past few years.\n\u201cYou guys are just showing off,\u201d Buckworth says as the group of us cruises from the restaurant to the hotel in his Range Rover.\nBut at The Shoals, sitting at a picnic table overlooking the Shelter Island Sound, Donadic points out that while their Oregon\u00a0 Road project is \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d so was the hotel and North Fork Table. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for it,\u201d he says.\nRecent sales and listings bode well for their goals. A spec home on Shelter Island asking $15 million went into contract in the middle of July, which would be a record sale on the patch of land less than a mile from where we\u2019re sitting (\u201cOur house is a steal,\u201d Juul-Hansen texted later when I sent him the listing).\nTwo other bayside waterfront properties recently hit the market asking $12 and $23 million, respectively, although it remains to be seen what they actually trade. Off the water, Winter Parker is trying to sell a 148-acre estate for $36 million, nearly double what it went for in 2008.\nNone of those are being shopped as spec homes, though, leaving Juul-Hansen and Donadic in uncharted waters.\n\u201cPeople are extraordinarily fearful of doing what we\u2019re doing, and correctly so, because it hasn\u2019t been done,\u201d he says.\nBut minutes later when he assesses what he and Donadic are creating, he wonders: \u201cHow can we fucking lose?\u201d",

        "content": "For over a century, the\nHamptons\nhave been known as a summer escape for the American affluent, a bucolic dream of old money, wood-shingled estates and white linen wardrobes. The farmers hocking their wares at roadside stands are staples in this vision of the South Fork, harkening back to when its primary industry and identity was agrarian. Land was for growing things, not for parcelling into multi-million-dollar spec homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this prized Americana vibe of farmstand culture here, it is unlike anywhere else in the country,\u201d Katie Baldwin, a farmer and co-founder of Amagansett farm Amber Waves, said. \u201cPeople have told me, \u2018I moved to Amagansett for Amber Waves.\u2019\u201d\nBaldwin and her co-founder Amanda Merrow\u2019s farm is a household name 17 years into farming, their trucker hats considered a status symbol with a certain Manhattan set. They\u2019re not alone \u2014 Balsam Farms in Amagansett, Milk Pail in Water Mill, Pike Farm in Sagaponack and Round Swamp Farm, with shops in Bridgehampton, East Hampton and Montauk, have all built cult-like followings among the rich, the famous and the influencers. Produce grown in the well-drained glacial soil fills their baskets, alongside prepared foods whose prices seem not to have ceilings.\n(In the case of Round Swamp, former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel, who recently sold her Bridgehampton home for $5.2 million, has racked up millions of views on TikTok\njust for raving\nabout the farm\u2019s chicken salad.)\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, that\u2019s a rare level of celebrity for farmstands.\nThat renown is in part thanks to prices that make most people gawk \u2014 a $30 two-quart container of berries, $120 lobster salad and $400 melons.\n\u201cPeople love farm field views.\u201d\nKieran Brew, Serhant agent\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to read that news coverage,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cEven if it looks easy, everyone is paddling like hell underneath.\u201d\nIn fact, once the economics come into focus, $400 barely seems enough for melon in a place where billionaires buy dirt for millions. Farms have to sell enough product in the mad dash from Memorial Day to Labor Day to sustain them through the rest of the year, and they have to do this on what you\u2019d think would be some of the most expensive land in the country.\nYet over four decades, farmers, conservation advocates, local governments and private citizens have banded together to create extreme land use restrictions that effectively devalue land to the point where it remains affordable to farmers and unappealing to anyone else. This, in turn, restricts the supply of homes and inflates values of properties adjacent to protected farmland. It\u2019s no silver bullet, but the careful honing of development code has protected the pastoral fantasy of the Hamptons, and the supply of expensive local strawberries.\nThe close view of how it all works is much less appealing than the displays of blueberries and heirloom tomatoes that draw the fans in.\n\u201cA lot of times when I talk about this, people\u2019s eyes glaze over,\u201d said Merrow. \u201cIt\u2019s how we exist out here.\u201d\nF\nallow fields\nLots of farmers have to navigate rising housing costs, labor costs, general economic uncertainty and a radical shift in the agricultural business. Bad weather or a bad crop could make the business go haywire. It is all high-risk \u2014 to tend the fields is to walk a tightrope.\nBut the biggest challenge in the South Fork is real estate.\nAs American wealth has grown, particularly in New York City, so too has the demand for homes in the Hamptons.\nProperty values have never been higher on the East End. Urban flight during the pandemic sent the market into a frenzy, and while it eventually mellowed, the new floor for pricing stayed. In January, Southampton\u2019s 4-acre La Dune estate at 366 and 376 Gin Lane sold at auction for\n$88.5 million\n. In February, an oceanfront estate at 370 and 372 Further Lane in Amagansett sold for\n$70 million\n.\nThat\u2019s not quite in budget for an upstart farmer. But even on the lower end, land in the Hamptons is out of reach. According to LandSearch, the average asking price for an acre of undeveloped land in East Hampton is $2.4 million. The average price for an acre of farmland in New York state is $2,525, according to AcreTrader, a farmland investment platform.\nTo make land affordable for the farmers, the towns of Southampton and East Hampton and conservation groups like the Peconic Land Trust devised a set of tools to effectively strip the value from the earth. It included a push to buy development rights for land, which restricts building on properties.\nThe purchases are financed with the Peconic Bay Transfer Tax, a 2 percent tax on real estate transactions that funnels directly into the Community Preservation Fund, or CPF. The booming real estate market means there\u2019s plenty of cash on hand.\n\u201cEast Hampton is fortunate to have high liquidity,\u201d Merrow said. In addition to running Amber Waves, she sits on the board of the Peconic Land Trust and East Hampton\u2019s CPF Advisory Board. \u201cThe town has a lot of power to move quickly.\u201d\nWith the funding, East Hampton closed one of the largest non-commercial deals of 2024, dropping\n$56 million\non 30 acres at 66 Wainscott Main Street from billionaire beauty heir Ronald Lauder.\nLauder had bought the land for $66 million in 2021 with the intention of preventing development. While land preservation is a lofty goal, it\u2019s also often a self-serving one. Kieran Brew, an agent with Serhant, said homes adjacent to agricultural reserves can see anywhere from a 15 to 20 percent premium.\n\u201cPeople love farm field views,\u201d he said. Lauder owns a home adjacent to the Wainscott Main Street parcel, according to published reports.\nNo matter the reason, private citizens looking to preserve land are a boon to farmers, the town and the trust. But plenty of sellers eschew altruism in favor of the best offer. That\u2019s where the towns run into trouble, as it can\u2019t legally pay more than the appraised value.\n\n\u201cProperties change hands for more than appraised value all the time,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cIf you have a family who wants to sell to the highest bidder, then it could be the town in competition with a developer.\u201d\nIn cases where the town comes up short, the trust and private donors step in. That\u2019s how the trust pulled off the $48 million purchase of 27 acres of Topping Farm in Bridgehampton last year, according to published reports. The land at 181 and 305 Halsey Lane was listed for\n$70 million\nin 2023, and marketed as a development site for up to eight homes.\nThe trust cobbled together $18 million of donations, including from former Coach CEO Lew Frankfort, to buy the tracts, and Southampton\u2019s CPF contributed $30 million to buy the development rights. As part of the deal, the restrictions on the land go beyond simply \u201cno mansions.\u201d It cannot be utilized as a tree farm, horse farm or a winery, and it cannot sit fallow. This is what\u2019s known as an affirmative farming covenant, and it\u2019s how the towns and trust are keeping farmland out of private estates.\nS\nharpening the tools\nThe affirmative farming covenant is the final boss of land use restrictions. It ensures that the land will produce food in perpetuity, and is coupled with protections that restrict the resale value. Between the mandate to farm and the knee-capped price growth, it is one of the only ways to make acreage in the Hamptons unappealing to the uber-rich seasonal residents.\nIt also finally brings down the price per acre to within reach of farmers, according to John v.H. Halsey, the founder and president of the Peconic Land Trust. In the case of the Topping Farm land, the trust is working on selling it to farmers from its apprenticeship program for $26,000 an acre, Halsey confirmed, down from the $1.8 million an acre the trust paid.\nThe covenant emerged as a response to an unpredicted outcome of the Hamptons\u2019 first efforts to preserve farmland. Even with development restricted, wealthy owners shocked the farmers and the towns with how they used the parcels.\n\u201cWe grow it, make it, bake it and sell it.\u201d\nKatie Baldwin, Amber Waves\n\u201cI can think of three baseball diamonds that are on ag reserves,\u201d Halsey said. Private vineyards, equestrian facilities and sprawling lawns are allowed on protected land without an affirmative farming covenant. Halsey estimated protected land can sell for as much as $300,000 an acre, too much for a farmer but a bargain to nearly every other Hamptons buyer.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not bound by the economics of agriculture,\u201d he said.\nBut as anyone in real estate knows, land is worth what a buyer is willing to pay.\n\u201cAt the start of these conservation tools, there wasn\u2019t foresight that there would be this market for land that you can\u2019t even build on,\u201d Merrow said. Very quickly, \u201cthe land trust and the towns started to see that land that was intended to be set aside for agriculture was leaving production, laying fallow.\u201d No new homes, perhaps, but also no fertile fields.\nG\none with the potatoes\nBefore everything was berries and lobster salad, the fields sprouted potatoes.\n\u201cIn the \u201980s, everything was potatoes,\u201d Dan Heston, director of agricultural programs with the Peconic Land Trust said, explaining that Long Island has some of the best, most acidic soil for potato growing in the country. Forget Idaho: \u201cThe potatoes want to grow out here.\u201d\nHeston, a farmer, remembers when Long Island potato growers wholesaled their crop to large distributors, he said. But it got too expensive to ship the spuds out, and the business of farming was changing. Nationally, the number of farms has dropped from a peak of 6.8 million in 1935, to 1.9 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The American Farmland Trust estimates 2,000 acres of farmland are lost to non-agricultural uses every day. Baldwin sees the East End as a microcosm of the dire national portrait of American farming. Many family farms, including in the Hamptons, lose acreage to the federal inheritance tax every year.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a million dollars to pay in taxes,\u201d Merrow said of local family farmers. \u201cAll of their wealth is in their farmland.\u201d\nTo survive, Hamptons farmers have shifted their strategies.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s desperation,\u201d Heston said. \u201cYou get really clever.\u201d\nTheir plans run the gamut from adding farmer\u2019s markets or trying community-supported agriculture memberships where customers pre-pay for a share of the season\u2019s yield. Other farmers have discovered that value-add products like cheese, baked goods, preserves and sauces are where the money can be made.\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the market in house,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe grow it, make it, bake it and sell it. It\u2019s a more sustainable business model.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also picking fruit and vegetables higher on the price pyramid.\n\u201cPeople are transitioning into crops that have the highest value per acre,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cCucumbers and baby greens and heirloom tomatoes \u2014 things that are beautiful and expensive.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the final piece of the puzzle, and the detail that inspired the headlines in the first place.\nFarms in the Hamptons depend on patrons paying $25 for a bag of granola and $18 for a jar of local honey. And of course they\u2019ll pay, especially after the millions of dollars spent by the town and donors to keep the farms around. Because the existence of the farms, with their cracking heirloom tomatoes set on worn wooden shelves, their pies coming out of the oven, is part of what makes this one of the most expensive luxury real estate markets in the country. Residents spend millions on homes just so that they can pop into the local farmstand on their way to the beach. It\u2019s a luxury.\n\u201cThe East End of Long Island has always been about the farms,\u201d Trotter said. \u201cPeople just want to preserve that.\u201d",

        "content": "In a closed-door meeting last month, Tishman Speyer\u2019s Rob Speyer had some questions for Zohran Mamdani.\nSpeyer asked about Mamdani\u2019s proposal to\nfreeze rents\nfor stabilized apartments, drilling down on the fact that such a move could discourage construction of rental buildings and\nplunge older housing stock\ninto further distress.\nThis was the Democratic mayoral nominee\u2019s first attempt to make his pitch to business leaders. Mamdani spoke with members of the Partnership for New York City, a consortium of business executives that includes some of the biggest names in the real estate industry.\nFor most of the organization\u2019s members, this was the first time that they\u2019d met Mamdani. According to\nPartnership CEO Kathy Wylde\n, the answers weren\u2019t a total flop.\nMamdani, per Wylde\u2019s telling, recognized the need to reexamine the city\u2019s property tax system, which has long been criticized for saddling multifamily properties with a disproportionate tax burden, and that a rent freeze would need to be combined with some relief for property owners.\n\u201cI think he responded in a way that could have given some comfort,\u201d she said.\nBut one meeting isn\u2019t going to change years\u2019 worth of fears the industry has about socialist leaders guiding New York policy. And although avenues of communication are beginning to open, the question remains whether Mamdani will actually listen to what real estate has to say.\n\u201cMamdani\u2019s diagnosis of our affordability crisis is correct, but I am concerned that some of his proposed solutions could make things worse, especially for working people,\u201d RXR CEO Scott Rechler said in an email.\nRechler, who wasn\u2019t at the closed-door meeting, noted that a \u201cmajor concern\u201d remains Mamdani\u2019s \u201cinability to directly condemn antisemitism\u201d and felt comments the Democratic nominee made during the Partnership meeting were a continuation of that. During the meeting, Mamdani pledged to discourage the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d used by some opponents of the war in Gaza, which some have interpreted as a call for violence against Jewish people, Gothamist reported.\nFor real estate specifically, the political and professional divides are likely more pronounced. Wylde said that executives in other sectors might not feel as threatened by Mamdani as real estate. They realize that much of what affects their business \u2014 such as, say, raising the corporate tax rate, as Mamdani has proposed \u2014 is outside the mayor\u2019s authority.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want the industry\u2019s support.\u201d\nanonymous developer now supporting Mamdani\n\u201cReal estate decisions are almost always made locally,\u201d she said.\nStill, Mamdani\nhas said\nhe supports streamlining the city\u2019s land use review process and curbing the ability of individual City Council members to\nkill\nrezonings, two ideas that developers can get behind. His pledge to freeze rents and raise taxes? Not so much.\n\nThe prospect of a Democratic Socialist leading New York City drove many real estate executives to pour money into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign. After Cuomo\u2019s loss in the Democratic primary, many have turned back to Mayor Eric Adams and are supporting his reelection bid in earnest.\nRechler donated $250,000 to the super PAC tied to Cuomo. After the primary, he said he was open to supporting Adams.\nLast month, Adams reported $1.5 million in contributions from June 10 to July 11, a majority of which he received after the primary. Donors working in the real estate or construction sector put in upwards of $480,000 during that time (which on its own was more than the $460,000-plus he raised from all donors between Jan. 12 and June 9). Real estate executives, including SL Green CEO Marc Holliday, have held fundraisers for Adams. Employees of the real estate investment trust gave the mayor more than $67,000, records show.\n\u201cVoters are looking at the alternative and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t afford to go backwards,\u2019\u201d Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams, said after the donations were made public.\nThe New York Apartment Association\u2019s super PAC spent more than $2.5 million supporting Cuomo\u2019s campaign. After his loss, the group didn\u2019t commit to a new candidate.\nAt this point, the organization is \u201cjust observing\u201d as the lead-up to the general election takes shape, said Kenny Burgos, CEO of NYAA. The group remains concerned about Mamdani\u2019s policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that his No. 1 policy would be the nail in the coffin,\u201d Burgos said.\nSome real estate professionals have publicly\nsupported\nMamdani, though their campaign donations total a fraction of what Cuomo and Adams have amassed. In the latest round of donations, Mamdani reported more than $6,500 from people who indicated that they worked in real estate, construction, architecture or in a housing-related occupation, though most in that bucket described their job as residential brokers, nonprofit or public housing specialists or as self-employed.\nOne developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is supporting Mamdani now that he is the Democratic nominee. The developer noted that being an Assembly member for a few terms likely isn\u2019t adequate preparation to lead the city, but he\u2019s hopeful Mamdani will surround himself with experienced people and get himself up to speed.\n\u201cI think he has a big learning curve, but I also think he\u2019s a smart guy,\u201d the developer said.\nAlthough the developer doesn\u2019t think Mamdani is trying to court the real estate industry \u2014 doing so could alienate his base \u2014 the candidate has shown that he\u2019s open to its concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want the industry\u2019s support,\u201d the developer said. \u201cHe does seem to be out trying to speak to everyone he can to understand what the issues are.\u201d\nOthers similarly pray that, if elected, Mamdani will at least have an open ear. Rechler said that he hopes that if Mamdani becomes mayor, he won\u2019t \u201ccompletely reject the private sector\u201d and will find ways to \u201charness its innovation, discipline, and capital.\u201d\nAfter Mamdani met with the Partnership, Adams took his turn with executives. Wylde described his speech as compelling, saying that the mayor framed the race in a way that many in the crowd have come to view it, as a fight against a movement and an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d",

        "content": "It takes serious imagination to envision dropping a 16-story indoor ski slope near swampland in South Florida. That\u2019s why the Ghermezian family, owners of the three largest shopping centers in North America, may be the only developers willing and able to pull it off.\nThe ski slope is among the entertainment centerpieces of the Ghermezians\u2019 plan to transform roughly 175 acres of barren land, tucked between two major highways in Miami-Dade County, into their biggest theme park mall yet.\nTriple Five, led by cousins Paul and Don Ghermezian, has long planned to develop\nAmerican Dream Miami,\na $4 billion, 6 million-square-foot entertainment and retail center. In addition to the ski slope, the project will feature a water park, 3-D cinema multiplex, 2,000 hotel rooms, and other theme park attractions. Bigger than the Ghermezians\u2019 Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, American Dream Miami would be the nation\u2019s largest indoor theme park mall.\nBut it is going to take more imagination and a lot more risk for the Ghermezians to actually deliver on their vision, and prevent their latest entertainment-and-retail dream from evaporating.\nIn recent years, the family has focused on getting the American Dream theme park mall in New Jersey on stable footing.\nAs a result, the Miami version seems like an afterthought, where the Ghermezians are tied up in legal fights with Miami-Dade County and the Graham Companies, a Miami Lakes-based development firm that agreed to sell 64 acres to Triple Five, which it needs for the project. Triple Five owns roughly 110 acres.\nThrough a spokesperson, Paul and Don Ghermezian declined interview requests for this story. In an interview for\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMarch issue\n, Paul Ghermezian acknowledged American Dream Miami was on the backburner. The project was previously supposed to open in 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very long-term players,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are passive projects.\u201d\nThe biggest hurdle for Triple Five is lifting the county\u2019s ban on seeking subsidies to help pay for road construction for the American Dream Miami site, including a new interchange connecting to Interstate 75, one of the highways near the planned development. The county could lift the ban, come September.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just working through all the entitlement and infrastructure things that need to go in,\u201d Paul Ghermezian said in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we have the water and sewage [connections] and [expressway] interchanges.\u201d\nR\noad work\nIn 2018, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved rezoning 175 acres from industrial to commercial uses, and entered into a development agreement with\nTriple Five\nthat required the developer to obtain state and federal approvals for on and exit ramps from the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 75, as well as the construction of local roads.\nThe developer secured $75 million in state funding for the construction of the Florida Turnpike interchange, as well as to purchase a right-of-way for the state to be able to build it, Triple Five\u2019s spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. The new interchange is scheduled for completion later this year.\nTriple Five also turned over 24 acres to the Florida Department of Transportation for the I-75 interchange. But the $425 million road project cannot happen unless the county rescinds the ban on funding the construction of local roads serving American Dream Miami.\n\u201cIn the context of a large development, the $5 million penalty may not be a huge thing.\u201d\nShlomo Chopp, Case Equity Partners\n\u201cThere is no point in building I-75 MGD Interchanges if it would be a road to nowhere,\u201d the Triple Five statement reads. \u201cThe County needs the I-75 interchange to be built, regardless of the American Dream Miami project, to relieve acute and worsening traffic congestion and to allow the larger area to be developed.\u201d\nWhen American Dream Miami was approved, Triple Five competitors\nSimon Property Group\n, Taubman Centers and General Growth Properties formed a coalition that successfully lobbied Miami-Dade County commissioners to include the road funding ban. The coalition\u2019s strategy knee-capped Triple Five\u2019s ambitions to quickly get started on building American Dream Miami.\nSince then, the Ghermezians found an ally on the commission willing to reverse the ban. Commissioner Juan Carlos Bermudez, who was elected in 2022 to represent the district where American Dream Miami will be built, said Triple Five was dealt an unfair hand. Bermudez noted that construction of Dolphin Mall, a retail center owned by Simon Property Group in Doral, was not subjected to a similar ban when it was built in 2001. The Florida Turnpike has on and off ramps that were built to funnel traffic to Dolphin Mall.\nShortly after taking office, he met with Don Ghermezian and agreed that Triple Five\u2019s project was singled out, Bermudez said. He is sponsoring a resolution removing the American Dream road-funding prohibition that is now scheduled to be heard in September.\n\u201cI wanted a level playing field to get roads built in my district,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cI agreed with [Don Ghermezian] that it shouldn\u2019t have happened. I told the Simon people too. It\u2019s a competition issue between them.\u201d\n\nL\negal fights\nAs Triple Five\u2019s plans stalled due to the road construction funding debacle, the clock was running out for the company. The developer is facing deadlines to get American Dream Miami moving, including finalizing the purchase of the 64 remaining acres from the\nGraham Companies.\nIn 2020, Triple Five and Graham completed a land swap for a separate 40 acres.\nIn July, county commissioners gave Triple Five a lifeline, agreeing to settle an April lawsuit the county filed seeking to cancel Miami-Dade\u2019s development agreement with the Ghermezians\u2019 firm because they had missed deadlines to submit a site plan and obtain the first round of building permits. Triple Five agreed to pay a $5 million penalty in four installments beginning next year to extend the deadlines and give the Ghermezians until 2045 to complete American Dream Miami.\nGiven the Ghermezians\u2019 overall investment in the project, it\u2019s a small price to pay to keep it on life support.\n\u201cIn the context of a large development, the $5 million penalty may not be a huge thing,\u201d said Shlomo Chopp with Case Equity Partners. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the case if [the Ghermezians] were flailing, didn\u2019t have a plan and everything was falling around them.\u201d\nStill, a legal battle with much higher stakes also hasn\u2019t been resolved. Last year, Triple Five sued the Graham Companies to keep alive a purchase agreement for the 64 acres. Graham claims the window to close the deal has expired, and refuses to recognize Triple Five\u2019s contention that the agreement was extended due to a force majeure clause in the contract.\n\u201cGovernmental delays have stalled the project, but clearly [Triple Five] has made substantial progress.\u201d\nTriple Five spokesperson\nTriple Five claims it was delayed as a result of the pandemic. Graham wants to jack up the purchase price, according to the complaint. Florida courts tend to narrowly construe force majeure clauses, meaning the triggering event must be specifically identified in the contract or fall under a catch-all provision and be both outside the parties\u2019 control and unforeseeable. That means if the word \u201cpandemic\u201d is not in the sale and purchase agreement, Triple Five may not win that argument.\nIn its response to the lawsuit, Graham alleges Triple Five has only itself to blame for the delays, and is using the pandemic and the bureaucratic delays over the road construction as an excuse. Attorneys for Graham did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we will reach an amicable resolution with Graham,\u201d Triple Five\u2019s spokesperson wrote.\nN\nothing concrete\nTriple Five has \u201cspent years of intense effort\u201d to just get to the point of lifting the ban on road construction funding, the company said.\n\u201cGovernmental delays have stalled the project, but clearly [Triple Five] has made substantial progress,\u201d the statement said. \u201c[Triple Five] has prepared the full administrative site plan for American Dream Miami and discussed it with county officials.\u201d\nYet, in his January interview with\nTRD\n, Paul Ghermezian\nadmitted\nAmerican Dream Miami is \u201ca number of years away\u201d and there\u2019s \u201cnothing really concrete today.\u201d\nThe project will also likely undergo some changes.\n\u201cI think they have an aspiration to build something there,\u201d commissioner Bermudez said. \u201cFrom some discussions with [Triple Five], it will be more entertainment oriented than retail oriented just because of the market conditions. But I have not seen a plan that says X, Y and Z. We are not at that stage anyway.\u201d\nNevertheless, the Ghermezian theme park mall model appears to be working. Mall of America in Minnesota, the Ghermezians\u2019 largest asset that had been mired in difficulties, is \u201ckilling it,\u201d said Chopp of Case Equity.\nYet, American Dream in New Jersey is still dealing with financial issues, such as a recent drop in value by $800 million, but has experienced success attracting patrons.\n\u201cThe Ghermezians are strong guys. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only ones that are really interested in developing this type of concept would be them and Disney. And Disney already has Orlando.\u201d\n\u2014\nE\nlizabeth Cryan contributed to this story.",

        "content": "It all started with lunch.\nDeveloper Ian Bruce Eichner took his daughter, Alexandra, to the Little Beet in New York for veggie-forward bowls.\nBefore accepting the invitation and picking the spot, she said, \u201cDad, no disrespect, but what\u2019s the agenda? There\u2019s no casual lunch with you,\u201d her father, who goes by Bruce, recounted.\nAbout halfway through the meal, he made the ask. Would she consider working with him for a six-month trial period? It was 2019. She was running a fitness consulting business, which she started after a position overseeing content and brand development for the health firm BeachBody.\nShe agreed to it, starting as assistant project manager at the family\u2019s Continuum Company in early 2020. Her mother, Leslie Eichner, is chief creative officer.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about succession because how would I know if she would like it, how would she fare, what would she be good at?\u201d Bruce said.\nAs it turned out, Alexandra liked it and fared well. She moved to South Florida from New York and became the on-the-ground deputy for all of the company\u2019s condo projects, which include the two-phase La Baia on the Bay Harbor Islands, a Continuum-branded development in North Bay Village and a luxury condo project planned in North Miami.\nNow president of Continuum Florida, she is about to complete the first development she\u2019s been involved in since its inception \u2014 La Baia South Residences, expected to be delivered this fall.\n\u201c[Bruce] has never had a me.\u201d\nAlexandra Eichner on why Continuum has been productive since she joined\nWhereas some major real estate players seem to believe they\u2019re immortal, ignoring succession planning, Eichner, 79, is taking seriously the idea of training his daughter, 37, to run his 1,000-unit, $3 billion condo portfolio. But he\u2019s still Bruce \u2014 obsessive, passionate. There\u2019s no set date, and he plans to keep working in the long term.\nLike some developers of his generation, Bruce is self-made. He\ngot into real estate\nwithout any capital or industry ties, while working as a prosecutor for the Brooklyn state attorney in 1973. He and his first wife, Helen, bought a rooming house, which he borrowed against to renovate the building. She got the property in the divorce, but he kept building.\nDespite\nroots in the Big Apple\n, it\u2019s not a coincidence that Alexandra is training up in the firm\u2019s most active market, South Florida.\n\u201cI think it is very difficult for a 30-year-old entrepreneurial spirit to do in New York between 2022 and 2050 what I, Bruce Eichner, was able to do from 1975 to 2000,\u201d he\nsaid\nin an interview with The Real Deal\u2019s publisher, Amir Korangy, in 2024. \u201cEasier to do it in a place like Florida, in a place that\u2019s growing and where it\u2019s more of a business-friendly environment.\u201d\n(The firm is still active in New York.)\nL\nike father, like daughter\nAlexandra shares a number of character traits with her dad. They\u2019re both to-the-point and want to be five steps ahead of you. Both have sharp senses of humor.\u00a0 Both are detail-oriented. Alexandra, meticulous, wants to understand the inner workings of projects, she said. She focuses on placement of every amenity or fixture, and on the user experience of each building function: how long elevators take to go up and down and where residents will plug in the hair dryer.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pay $1,500 a square foot, I don\u2019t want you to have weird edges of corners that you can\u2019t use,\u201d she said.\nBruce is \u201calways madly chasing the next piece of dirt,\u201d Alexandra said, while she\u2019s consumed with zoning. It\u2019s her superpower, she said. She jokes that she\u2019s reduced her land-use attorneys\u2019 billable hours, but the skill gives her an edge compared to her competitors.\nAfter five years, she can also now look at a site and visualize the building that will go there, which she couldn\u2019t do when she started.\n\u201cKnowing as much as the lawyers do and understanding what the lawyers don\u2019t know \u2014 that is the essence of a real estate developer,\u201d Bruce said.\nAttorney Rachel Streitfeld, mayor of North Bay Village, describes Alexandra as \u201cenergetic, relentless and savvy.\u201d\nAlexandra works out every day, including \u201cheavy weight lifting,\u201d she said \u2014 her personal record is deadlifting 205 pounds. The more stress she\u2019s managing, the more you\u2019ll spot her at the gym. \u201cNo pilates,\u201d she emphasized. She can do seven pull-ups from a strict, straight-arm hang and has climbed to the South Pole.\nShe has also cultivated her risk muscle.\nWhen the Waldorf Astoria Beach Club in Boca Raton, now called the Boca Raton Resort, was closing, Alexandra had the chance to buy the furniture, worth $20,000 per room, for $1,200 a room. She figured it could decorate the former Best Western hotel at a site Continuum had just purchased in North Bay Village, now called the Palm Tree Club.\nThe only problem? Continuum wouldn\u2019t be closing on the property for several months, but the furniture purchase had to happen now \u2014 or never.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the quality and color palette of the furniture I knew we wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity like this, so I took a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I spent the next three months joking with my husband that we might have 120 keys worth of furniture sitting in storage if we didn\u2019t close on the property.\u201d\nT\nhe Eichners\ni\nn North Bay Village\nNorth Bay Village is a small three-island city that sits inside Biscayne Bay, between the mainland and Miami Beach. A 2020 zoning code overhaul allowed for bigger projects, and\ndevelopers came.\nThe Eichners bought the first 1.4-acre part of its site, at 1755 79th Street Causeway, in 2023 for $35 million. They picked up the second part, the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill with an adjacent Best Western, for $75 million last year. (Jesta Group had planned to redevelop the latter property but sold it to Continuum.)\nThe pipeline is robust in the village, but Continuum is the first big project to move forward with building permits, Streitfeld said.\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time, energy and money overhauling our zoning code,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worked our butts off. The approvals mean nothing for the municipality until someone pulls a permit.\u201d\nContinuum\u2019s work will give others proof of concept, she added: \u201cA lot is riding on them.\u201d\nThe first phase, called Continuum Club &amp; Residences, is under construction and at least 50 percent presold.ma\nOther projects include one from Sunbeam Properties, led by Andy Ansin of the billionaire Ansin family, which assembled about 13 acres, and in 2022 secured approvals for a massive, phased development. Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons also plans a Pagani-branded, 30-story, 70-unit condo project in North Bay Village. Shoma Group, led by Masoud Shojaee and his wife, Stephanie, is working on Shoma Bay, a condo tower, but has been delayed; construction could start later this year, based on a recently amended development agreement. Related Group and Macklowe Properties also\nplan\nto develop hundreds of condos on Harbor Island in North Bay Village.\nIn 2023, Alexandra helped write the village\u2019s workforce housing law, which passed in 2023. The law, among other things, requires that developers set aside a percentage of units in new rental projects as workforce housing, incentivizing them with additional height or density.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just so ready to dig into the weeds and the details and look at the code, question the code, work with our planners and make sure she understands the regulatory framework,\u201d Streitfeld said. \u201cEven in the cases where we weren\u2019t so thrilled about something, she presented her position so effectively that we were won over.\u201d\nIn June, the North Bay Village Commission unanimously\napproved\na special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the entire Continuum Waterfront District, which encompasses both sites and is planned to have two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall.\nThe idea to bring in Palm Tree, the hospitality company run by DJ Kygo and his manager Myles Shear, to the current hotel and restaurant in the interim before development started, was Alexandra\u2019s idea.\nThe restaurant and bar now feels like an influencer\u2019s dream (and some residents\u2019 nightmares due to the loud music). It has brought a hipper crowd to North Bay Village.\nF\nuture lunch invitations?\nIn 2022, Alexandra secured a \u201cgnarly approval\u201d at the Bay Harbor development after a new building official determined that the already entitled La Baia South project had an issue with FEMA compliance.\n\u201cI found this funky mechanism that allowed us to reduce our parking count to be compliant with other things, which required approval. That was the first time I realized I was very into reading code,\u201d she said. It was a make-or-break moment for the project, and when she solved it, she got a promotion to president of Continuum Florida.\nNow, La Baia South, a waterfront building designed by architect Luis Revuelta, is expected to be delivered within three months. It\u2019s still unknown whether this project will replicate or exceed the Eichners\u2019 success at the two-tower Continuum South Beach, completed in the early 2000s, where condos have appreciated in value over the years, holding some of the stronger per-square-foot pricing in Miami Beach.\n\u201cYou either hand her the baton for the project or you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the challenge for the dad, when I have to step back or not.\u201d\nIan Bruce Eichner on succession\nAlexandra plans to live at the new building, which has 68 units and eight stories, with her husband, Ozzie Pagan, who leads global finance for the commodities bank Macquarie, and their two mini Goldendoodles, Brooklyn and Blueberry.\nAlexandra, Bruce said, still has more to learn, including the execution of an acquisition and fully understanding the intricacies of construction.\n\u201cWhat is intellectually challenging, you either hand her the baton for the project or you don\u2019t,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge for the dad, when I have to step back or not.\u201d\nStill, you get the sense from them that they are partners. Bruce is not a swashbuckling, cowboy developer who demands his adult children do what he says \u2014 or else. And Alexandra\u2019s happy to be challenged.\n\u201cI want my brain to be working very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not up at two in the morning thinking about a problem, I\u2019m probably bored.\u201d\nEven if succession wasn\u2019t front of mind for Bruce or Alexandra at that lunch in New York, a plan is clearly in motion. Bruce told\nTRD\nthat Alexandra\u2019s sister, Lindsay, a former real estate agent, could also eventually work for the family business.\nIn the meantime, the family firm is looking north to markets like Fort Lauderdale and Singer Island, Alexandra said, which are less saturated than the Miami Beaches and Brickells of the region. They\u2019re busy, with two gung-ho developers at the helm.\n\u201c[Bruce] has never had a me,\u201d Alexandra said. \u201cAnd we are both pretty productive.\u201d",

        "content": "Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners bagged 10 open-air shopping centers for $395 million, with the portfolio heavily weighted toward the Sunshine State and specifically South Florida,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nBoston-based private equity firm Bain and New York-based retail investment firm 11North bought nine plazas in Florida, five of which are in Broward and Palm Beach counties, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. One property is in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\u201cThe NOI [net operating income] is definitely majority in South Florida. It\u2019s over 50 or 55-plus percent in South Florida,\u201d said Martha Kelley of Bain.\nEntities tied to Newark, New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate, the real estate arm of Prudential Financial\u2019s global investment manager PGIM, sold the South Florida shopping centers, according to records.\nJLL will take over management of the properties from Coral Gables-based commercial real estate firm Southeast Centers.\nThis was an all-cash deal, and the buyers plan to secure a loan in the future, Kelley said.\nThe\nBroward\nproperties include: the 217,000-square-foot Sawgrass Square at 12500 West Sunrise Boulevard in\nSunrise\n; the 154,000-square-foot Plantation Promenade at 10065 Cleary Boulevard in Plantation; and the 84,000-square-foot Miramar Commons at 11000 Pembroke Road in\nMiramar\n, according to records.\nIn\nPalm Beach County\n, Bain and 11North purchased the 29,000-square-foot Lake Worth Plaza at 4360 State Road 7 in an unincorporated area of the county near Wellington; and the 143,000-square-foot Garden Shops at Boca at 7060 West Palmetto Park Road in an unincorporated area of the county near\nBoca Raton\n.\nElsewhere in Florida, the portfolio consists of three plazas in Kissimmee. They are the\u00a0 160,000-square-foot Rolling Oaks Commons; the 86,000-square-foot Promenade at Poinciana; and the 38,500-square-foot Solivita Marketplace. In Tampa, Bain and 11North bought the 94,000-square-foot New Tampa Center.\nThe South Carolina plaza is the 75,000-square-foot Point Hope Commons in Charleston.\nThe portfolio has an occupancy of more than 93 percent, the release says.\n\nA Publix store anchors Sawgrass Square, Plantation Promenade, Miramar Commons, Garden Shops at Boca, Promenade at Poinciana, New Tampa Center and Point Hope Commons. Other tenants at the properties include Chick-fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Bank of America and Chipotle.\n\u201cWe speak with tenants on a daily basis. Florida is one of the highest markets where they want to expand to,\u201d said Brian Harper, CEO of 11North.\nBain Capital, founded in 1984, has roughly $185 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It invests across business lines, including real estate, tech, life sciences, crypto, credit, and private and public equity. Ryan Cotton leads\nBain\u2019s real estate division\n.\nBain Capital Real Estate purchased the portfolio through one of its funds and will eventually syndicate a portion of the portfolio to a global limited partner, said Kelley, declining to name the partner.\n11North was founded last year by Harper, following Kimco Realty\u2019s acquisition of RPT Realty, where he was CEO. 11North staff members are formerly of RPT. Bain Capital has an ownership stake in 11North.\nLast year, Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North formed a joint venture to invest in retail, especially open-air shopping plazas. The Florida and South Carolina portfolio marks the joint venture\u2019s second purchase. In June, it paid about $212 million for three shopping centers in Oklahoma City, according to a release announcing the deal at the time.\nSouth Florida\u2019s retail market showed signs of\nsoftening\nin the second quarter, as vacancy rates creeped up, and the average asking rent slightly decreased, according to a Colliers report. Broward\u2019s vacancy hit 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent during the second quarter of last year, while Palm Beach County\u2019s hit 4.4 percent, up from 3.6 percent. Palm Beach County\u2019s average asking rent dropped to $28.85 per square foot from $29.51 a square foot, year-over-year. Broward still experienced an increase of the average asking rent to $28.52 a square foot, from $27.78 a square foot, year-over-year, according to the report.\nGrocery-anchored\nshopping centers have proven to be resilient, and investment sales of these properties continue. Last month, Boston-based Longpoint paid\n$34 million\nfor the Presidente Supermarket-anchored Miramar Parkway at 3176 South University Drive in Miramar.\nIn June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group sold the Whole Foods-anchored Marketplace at the Outlets shopping center at 1821 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach for\n$133.2 million\n.\nPublix also has been purchasing its standalone supermarkets and shopping centers anchored by its stores. Over the past year, the Lakeland-based grocer has paid about $273 million for these properties, including\n$25 million\nin March for its store and a Starbucks outparcel at 2501-2519 East Sunrise Boulevard at the Galleria Mall in Fort Lauderdale.\n",

        "content": "Some condo developers are reporting good news.\nRicardo Dunin is among them. He says his sales team secured contracts for 77 condo sales at his two condo-hotel projects in Brickell, Domus Brickell Park and Domus Brickell Center, within the last 70 days or so. (The average price of the units is $584,000.)\nHe explains why.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ahead of schedule. We pay the brokers 100 percent on time. People love that we have a professional management company that will take care of the buildings. And the price point for a luxury product with good taste is very attractive,\u201d he says.\nThis is not the norm.\n\u201cWhat I hear is everyone else is struggling,\u201d says Dunin, CEO of Oak Capital and co-founder of North Development.\nAbout three years ago, the short-term rental condo project model boomed in South Florida. Investors liked the price point and the promised rental income, or the suggestion that they would earn their money back, and then some. Then the market got a bit oversaturated.\nDunin, who was among the developers of the first big wave of condo-hotels built in the \u201890s, seems to have found a sweet spot. He plans to launch a third Domus-style project by early next year, and is under contract to purchase the site for a fourth development. Domus Brickell Park is 67 percent presold, and Domus Brickell Center is about 30 percent presold, he says.\nThirty-seven percent of his buyers are domestic, which means the overwhelming majority are international, and most of those are Latin American buyers, he said. These are investors looking to purchase small units they can rent out on a short-term basis.\nThe foreign buyer hasn\u2019t disappeared, though some have retreated.\nA new report released by the Miami Association of Realtors and a handful of top brokerages \u2014 Cervera Real Estate, ISG World, PMG, Serhant and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 states that about about half of the presold units in Miami\u2019s new construction pipeline are being purchased by foreign buyers. Sixty percent of the 9,115 condos are presold or in contract.\nThe problem we have tracking new development sales is that no public record can corroborate the information developers and brokers put out there, until these buildings are completed and the deeds recorded. So for the years that these projects are in the presales/construction process, the sales teams are the gatekeepers of this information.\nAnd unfortunately, the information that made it into the report is pretty limited. It doesn\u2019t break down sales figures by project, nor does it disclose when these contracts were signed.\nIt\u2019s meant to help flip the doom and gloom outlook that\u2019s playing out in some areas, projects and segments of the market. The aging condo market, made up of buildings that are 30 years and older, is struggling in part because of increased regulations (a reaction to the deadly Surfside condo collapse in 2021).\nAlicia Cervera Lamadrid, managing partner of her family\u2019s brokerage firm, Cervera Real Estate, says the perception that interest from foreign buyers is waning stemmed from The New York Times\u2019 June 5 article titled:\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought this is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve read in a long time,\u201d she tells me.\nThe Times\u2019 story referred to the Miami Association of Realtors\u2019 report that found home sales to foreign buyers fell to 10 percent of all transactions in the tri-county region from August 2023 to July 2024. This was the lowest share since 2015. That report was a survey of nearly 2,400 real estate agents in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties. New developments likely weren\u2019t included.\nThis prompted Cervera and other brokerage heads to take action. \u201cThere were no optics into preconstruction,\u201d Cervera adds.\nAlfredo Pujol, chairman-elect of the Miami Realtors, says the idea for the latest report came from \u201call the [articles] we hear that are negative\u201d \u2014 not just the Times. He was surprised by the high share of sales represented by foreign buyers, but not that foreign buyers are still in the market.\n\nTheir report tracked new development sales for the 18-month period ending in June.\n\u201cWe have huge demand from Latin America. Colombia has been strong, Guatemala, Honduras. We\u2019re seeing great demand from Brazil as well,\u201d Cervera says. \u201cPeople are looking at these as second homes/investment properties. I personally think many of these units may turn into full-term residences.\u201d\nCervera\u2019s leading sales and marketing for Dunin\u2019s projects.\nCompass agent Mike Martirena, of the Ivan &amp; Mike Team, and his partner, Ivan Chorney, have been traveling all summer to meet clients abroad.\n\u201cMy foreign buyers tend to like the condo-hotel component. They look at it like a safe haven.\u201d Martirena says.\nHave President Trump\u2019s immigration policies and mass deportations affected his international clients\u2019 mindsets? No, he says.\n\u201cThey want to make sure their money is safe,\u201d he says, \u201cwhether they agree with the politics or not.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI did hear that construction has slowed way down at one big Brickell condo development, and at a smaller project nearby, the developer has been returning buyers\u2019 deposits. Do you know of any others that are floundering? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Alexandre De Macedo, an executive in the restaurant industry, and his wife Clarissa De Macedo sold their over 9,600-square-foot single-family home at 4725 Davis Avenue in Miami to a trust for $23 million.\nCommercial:\nClarion Partners sold the apartment complex known as 33 West at 6300 Southwest 24th Place in Davie for $97.5 million. Crow Partners purchased the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe new waterfront estate at 2914 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach hit the market for\n$27.9 million\n. The 8,540-square-foot mansion, with seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a saltwater pool, spa, rooftop decks and an outdoor kitchen is listed with William Raveis Real Estate agent Steve Simpson. The nearly half-acre property has 80 feet of direct water frontage and a dock. Property records show a company owned by John Galiher, founder of Preferred Freezer Services, paid $3.5 million for the property in 2021.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nActivate Hospitality paid $10 million for the former Palihouse hotel in Miami Beach\u2019s Faena District. Halstatt Real Estate Partners sold the 71-key property at 3101 Indian Creek Drive, now known as the Hotel Trouvail. Activate\u2019s Sagar Desai tells me the company plans to complete a $1 million refresh of the hotel and will bring in a local food and beverage operator for the ground floor. It will remain open.\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management\u2019s heavily redacted hurricane evacuation plan for the Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention center drew criticism from lawmakers and advocates who are demanding more transparency,\nCBS Miami\nreports. The plan omits key details like alternate relocation sites and vendor procedures.\nFlorida\u2019s Third District Court of Appeal ruled that Miami\u2019s decision to postpone its 2025 election without voter approval was unconstitutional, reaffirming the lower court\u2019s decision in the case and siding with mayoral candidate Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nSt. Petersburg officials and the Tampa Bay Rays discussed a potential $40 million settlement to end the team\u2019s lease at Tropicana Field instead of repairing the hurricane-damaged stadium. Repair costs are nearing $60 million, according to the\nTampa Bay Times\n. The Rays\u2019 agreement with the city has them playing at Tropicana Field through the 2028 season, which was later extended one year after Hurricane Milton tore through the dome.",

        "content": "Three summers ago, 50 acres of bare land was returned to the City of Pasadena. Rarely can you stumble upon an empty plot of that magnitude in such a desirable spot in Southern California. But the land is still undeveloped and without a master plan.\nThe parcel once belonged to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but after a failed, decades-long battle to extend a freeway, the government-entity relinquished the property\u2019s control to the city. No one expected the \u201cstub,\u201d as the land is called, to be totally developed by now but people hoped for at least a master plan.\nThe area, meant to be an extension of the 710 that would ultimately connect Long Beach to Pasadena, was cleared in the 1970s, displacing thousands of people and destroying homes that were owned or rented by mostly low-income and minority residents,\naccording to\ncity officials. Once the land was returned, the city chose to consider its development potential through a \u201crestorative justice framework.\u201d\nWhatever the framework, a lack of political will among elected officials appears to be stalling progress.\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind where we should be, without a question,\u201d city council member Steve Madison said.\nGeoffrey Baum, a former president of the West Pasadena Residents Association who has served as an elected trustee of Pasadena City College, said there appears to be \u201czero urgency,\u201d and called it \u201ca shame\u201d that there has been little to no progress, leaving a \u201cmassive scar\u201d in the heart of the city.\nPasadena-based real estate attorney Richard McDonald sees it as a case of politicians being prudent to a fault, getting nowhere because they\u2019re unwilling to risk upsetting anyone.\nThe city council appointed an advisory group to assist in the planning efforts that have almost solely focused on social justice, Madison said.\nBut as Baum understands it, people weren\u2019t forcibly removed from their homes\u2013-they were compensated. To clear the area for the failed 710 freeway extension, the properties were obtained using a\nhardship acquisition\nprocess. That isn\u2019t to say people had much of a choice. But it wasn\u2019t a Chavez Ravine situation, Baum said, a reference to the predominantly low-income Mexican-American communities that were violently\nevicted\nin the late 1950s to build Dodgers Stadium through eminent domain.\n\nEfforts to correct past, perceived injustices will only continue to delay the project, Baum said.\nThe ad hoc committee hasn\u2019t done much better it seems. The four-member body has met less than a handful of times and lacks a leader and action, according to Madison, who along with two other council members and the mayor are on it.\n\u201cThe bottleneck is the city council, and in particular, the mayor,\u201d Madison said.\nMayor Victor Gordo, who holds a citywide elected position, did not respond to a request. Still, it\u2019s on the council to lay out a clear vision. For Madison that could mean a transportation element, housing and a sacred place: a plaza or park of sorts.\nConsultants have been brought on, and a $2.8 million\ncontract\nhas gone to architecture firm Perkins Eastman, which did not respond to a request for comment. Madison called some of the firm\u2019s proposed plans provocative and thoughtful and others \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d One, he said, included a water feature, which he described as a moat between West Pasadena and the rest of the city.\nAnother consultant, David Grannis, who worked on the return of the land and was later hired by the city, said things could have gone a little faster, and that \u201cthe city council has to kind of get their arms around how they want to play this game,\u201d which he believes it is now doing. He said a land-use concept plan is coming toward the end of the year \u2014 a campus plan of some sort is what he said Perkins is considering. The city council will have some decisions to make, then the legal process, likely securing entitlements and an environmental review, begins. And developers are interested, Grannis said.\nMcDonald, however, doesn\u2019t think a request for proposal (RFP) has gone out. None of his clients have made a move, he said. Developers want an element of certainty, they want to know what they can build, McDonald said, but the city itself doesn\u2019t even know.\nWhen asked about an RFP, assistant city manager Brenda Harvey Williams only said the city has engaged consultants to advise on the master plan process, develop the master plan and document the history of the stub.\nAs for whether developers have approached the city, she said, \u201cnot yet as it is not the time for that,\u201d in an emailed statement.\nAt the moment, the city isn\u2019t hemorrhaging money sitting on the land, but it is losing out on revenues, job creation, transportation formation, housing and retail development.\n",

        "content": "Entrepreneur Dara Mir will now be able to enjoy a Hailey Bieber smoothie in the former\nhome of Erewhon\u2019s owners\n.\nErewhon CEO Anthony Antoci and president Josephine Antoci have sold their Bel Air mansion for $28.5 million to Mir, husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lily Ghalichi,\nRobb Report\nreported.\nThe home at\n755 Sarbonne Road\nsold for more than $6 million above what the Antocis paid for it a year ago. Shortly after purchasing the property, the couple put it up for rent, with the most recent price being $200,000 per month, according to Robb Report. Mir secured the property for $4.5 million less than the final asking price \u2014 a nearly $9 million discount from the original asking price of nearly $37 million.\nThe property was acquired by an entity tied to Nigerian businessman Kola Aluko in 2012 for $24.5 million. At some point after that,\nThomas Flohr\n, founder of private jet company VistaJet, bought the Sarbonne Road property in an apparent off-market deal. The Department of Justice, in pursuit of Aluko, attempted to seize the property after it had been transferred to Flohr, leading the Swiss businessman to pay $16 million to avoid losing it. He then listed the manse at $63 million, which dropped to $22.5 million by the time the Antocis bought it in May 2024.\n\nSpanning 15,000 square feet on a 1-acre lot, the property features six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and a bevy of amenities for its new owner. The main entrance has a curved staircase with a wooden door framed by limestone blocks. The palatial home has 16-foot ceilings and travertine floors with an elevator between the three floors.\nA formal living room includes a wet bar and fireplace while the formal dining room has a sweeping view of the city. The home\u2019s great room opens out to the pool and includes a casual lounge, a dining nook and a family kitchen. It also has a secondary chef\u2019s kitchen.\nNew owner Bir can find peace and quiet in a wood-paneled study or enjoy a movie in a screening room with another wet bar. The owner can also work up a sweat at the fitness center and cool off in a spa next to the infinity-edge lap pool. The terrace overlooks the city and is shaded by olive trees.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s all in the family at Jamison, a developer based in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown that has become the name to know for office-to-residential conversions.\nJaime Lee\nis the public face of\nthe $6 billion real estate company\n, which her parents co-founded in 1994. Her father, David Lee, also an internist, is now chairman. Her mother, dentist Miki Nam, oversees the firm\u2019s accounting department. They named the company for Jaime, the oldest of their four kids, and she was promoted to CEO in 2020.\nHer oldest brother, Phillip, runs the office\u2019s property management department, while the baby of the family, Garrett, runs multifamily development. Jaime\u2019s husband, Matt Cheesebro, runs an affiliated multifamily general contracting company. The middle brother, Brian, is in multifamily property management. Phill\u2019s wife, Stephanie, is a lawyer at Jamison.\nThe Lee clan is a family of high achievers.\nJaime, Phill and Garrett received their JDs from the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. Middle brother Brian, who\nran a gallery/bar\nin Koreatown and served as an art consultant for Jamison before recently joining the family business, has a master\u2019s degree in business.\nThe siblings, who span in age from 36 to 40, are all \u201creally close,\u201d Jaime said.\nJamison has a portfolio spanning 18 million square feet, including 33 multifamily buildings with 6,600 units in the city of Los Angeles, as well as office, retail and medical properties throughout Southern California. Assets include the 1.8-million-square-foot Equitable Plaza and the World Trade Center office complex. Jamison also has 2,000 residential units under construction.\nThe Real Deal\ntalked to Jaime in a conference room at the company\u2019s 428-unit Opus rental building in Koreatown, about the family business, racism and parenting.\nWhen\nTRD\nfollowed up with some questions about the company\u2019s early reputation as a \u201cslumlord,\u201d and some of the firm\u2019s properties being sent to special servicing recently, Lee went mum. But on topics of longevity, raising her kids as a second-generation immigrant and her career trajectory, she shared responses.\nThe interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: November 14, 1984\nHometown\n: San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles\nLives\n: Mid-City area of Los Angeles\nFamily\n: Husband; children ages 9, 7 and 5; and puppy Kona\n\u201cThere are so many people who always are like, \u2018Oh, successful people wake up before everybody.\u2019 That\u2019s bullshit. No. Night Owl. All my best work: like 10 p.m. to midnight.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve completed seven office-to-residential conversions.\nWe\u2019re under construction on three right now, and we probably have 10 more in the pipeline that we\u2019d like to do.\nHow does that impact the office market?\nWe\u2019ve just been notoriously oversupplied in office in the City of Los Angeles, and severely undersupplied in housing. So I think this is a rebalancing of what the needs are for our city. Ground-up construction just isn\u2019t penciling because of a myriad of factors, but the conversion still works really well.\nHow did your parents get into real estate?\nMy parents emigrated from South Korea when they were in their teens. They met in grad school at UCLA. My mom became a dentist. And my dad was an internist. Back then, being a doctor was a pretty stable and good job, and you could make money and have some savings. So they would invest in all these side businesses. And they started investing in real estate. This was after the riots [following the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department officers in the Rodney King beating case] in 1992 and then the earthquake in 1994.\nProperty\nvalues in this area were just decimated.\nHow does it work with you being the boss at work?\nMy parents are still around, so we\u2019re still in our first-generational shift. And I think it\u2019s really fascinating as you talk to other family businesses because everyone goes through it their own way. But you\u2019re not rewriting a story that has never been told. So for instance, I spoke at a family business class at USC years ago, but when [the professor] first approached me, I was like, \u201cWhy would anyone want to hear me talk about my family business?\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh, because family businesses are all very similar.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not, like we have all these idiosyncrasies, like we have all of these things that make our story unique and different.\u201d And he referenced the family business textbook. And I flipped through the textbook, [thinking,] \u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re all the same!\u201d\nWas it always assumed you\u2019d become the CEO?\nI think so. I think in Korean culture, though, it\u2019s like the eldest son gets a lot of favor too.\nWas there something you would have been doing otherwise?\nNot careerwise, but I did apply to MFA programs in writing in New York during my senior year. I was an English major in undergrad at University of Southern California and would have loved to live and write in New York for a couple years before law school and joining the business.\nHow did you end up ahead of your siblings at Jamison?\nI am the oldest and I\u2019ve been in the business for the longest period of time. I think I have a skill set and a personality that make me attuned to a leadership role. I\u2019ve served on over 30 corporate and civic and nonprofit boards \u2014 many times I rise to chair or president. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg thing with being an eldest daughter. If you just grow up and you are naturally responsible for younger people, then maybe you learn to talk to different personalities in different ways, and to intrinsically lead.\nHow would your siblings describe you in a few adjectives?\nThey\u2019d probably say bossy, maybe hyperbolic. My first brother would definitely be [sarcastic], like, \u201cOh, Jaime never exaggerates!\u201d I think I\u2019ve matured a lot since we were kids. When I was younger, they would be like, \u201cOh, Jaime always has to be right.\u201d\nSo they wouldn\u2019t say that now?\nThey probably still would, but that\u2019s from knowing me for 40 years. In my own self-reflection I would say no. With kids you really have to be like, \u201cMommy made a mistake,\u201d because you have to model for children that you cannot be perfect. And so I try to approach my work with that too, that we\u2019re all just iterating. You don\u2019t have to know exactly what you\u2019re doing all the time. You can\u2019t make the exact perfect decision 100 percent of the time, and you also have to be willing to say, like, \u201cwhoops.\u201d\nPerfectionism is such a disease. There\u2019s no such thing as being perfect. There are a lot of people who are much older than I am and are very, very successful, whether it\u2019s in our industry or other places where I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, they just have it all figured out.\u201d I talk to them and they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just like making it up half the time,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re the CEO of this public, huge company!\u201d And they\u2019re just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up here.\u201d\n\nDoes parenting help you at work?\nYes. For instance, sometimes you\u2019ll be in a meeting with a horrendous bully or somebody who\u2019s very, very difficult, and I might say, \u201cYou seem upset. Are you okay? Are you feeling okay?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d And you put some snacks out, and they\u2019re, like, starving. And they\u2019re coming from this place of just not being in homeostasis in their body. And they\u2019ll eat the protein bar and drink some water. And I\u2019m like, \u201cCan we take a break for 10 minutes?\u201d And I\u2019ll come back and they\u2019re fine. And those are the types of things I\u2019ll do with my kids. I didn\u2019t know those kinds of things before. I would just escalate.\nWhat\u2019s it like raising your kids as a second-generation immigrant versus how you were raised by first-generation immigrants?\nMy parents worked, and still work, extremely hard just to get solid footing under them in a new country. First-gen parents will always say that their kids are lazy and not tough enough to do what they did, and that\u2019s probably true.\nOur hard work is different in nature from their hard work, and I imagine it will be different still with my kids. I was definitely a latchkey kid in the Valley in the 1990s. We roamed the neighborhood, could only spend what we earned, and had very little supervision. What we learned out of necessity, I try to teach my kids as an education. They know the value of a dollar and how to earn it, but I\u2019m trying really hard to avoid the immigrant scarcity mindset that was so ingrained in me.\nYour parents, siblings and you have advanced degrees!\nI think if you are an immigrant, education is the great equalizer, and my family still believes that. What we saw though [the weekend of June 14 and 15], with the protests [part of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d day of action against the Trump administration], and what we inherently feel being Asian American is this concept of [being a] perpetual foreigner and this idea of diaspora \u2014 like, we don\u2019t belong in Korea, but a lot of times we feel like we don\u2019t belong here either.\nDo you feel like that now?\nOne hundred percent. When people see me at first glance, a lot of times people don\u2019t assume that [I\u2019m] American. And even walking around in front of our properties in Downtown L.A. people have yelled, \u201cKonnichiwa, go home.\u201d\nKonnichiwa is Japanese. And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not Japanese.\u201d But I also try not to engage because it\u2019s very scary.\nWhen you enter a room with real estate folks, do you feel discrimination as a woman and being of Korean descent?\nMost misogyny and overt harassment have declined a lot. We still don\u2019t have nearly as many female leaders in the industry as anyone expected to see or wanted to see.\nYou met President Biden. What was that like? Did he seem in any way not with it?\nNo, he was great. You see lots and lots of photos and videos of people who are president and they look just like a normal person. And when you actually meet someone who has served at that level, it\u2019s something else, like his eye contact, his presence. We were frozen in a moment in time. He was very charismatic. He asked me a couple great questions about climate and sustainability at the port within the shipping industry. He was the real deal.\n\u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re all the same!\u201d\non the epiphany that all family businesses are basically alike\nLet\u2019s do a quick lightning round. Tommy\u2019s or In-N-Out?\nIn-N-Out, of course.\nPoke or tacos?\nTacos.\nUber or Waymo?\nI\u2019ve never ridden in a Waymo, so I think it\u2019s like Uber by default. But I\u2019m obsessed with longevity and the longevity sciences so I\u2019ve been drinking way, way, way less. And I know that the only reason to Uber is not just because you\u2019re drinking, but I usually just drive myself.\nHow did you get into longevity?\nI sadly had a friend who passed away a few years ago, just after her 40th birthday. We both had young kids then, and I became obsessed with health, prevention, screenings and optimizing healthspan. Most of the people I know are engaged with these pursuits at varying levels. Many people put too much emphasis on supplements or experimental treatments. I focus on the three main buckets: sleep \u2014 the most important \u2014 exercise and food. Each of these has an enormous body of research, habits and protocols that go along with them.\nBack to the lightning round: Which private club \u2014 California Club or Jonathan Club?\nJonathan Club. They usually say Cal Club is for the people who own LA, and Jonathan Club is for the people who run L.A. The Jonathan Club is much more modern, diverse. I love it. I want to go somewhere that\u2019s an extension of my home, and the Jonathan Club is definitely that.\nAre you a member?\nYes.\nLakers or Clippers?\nLakers, that\u2019s an easy one.\nThe Getty or Los Angeles County Museum of Art?\nLACMA.\nMorning lark or night owl?\nDefinitely night owl. There are so many people who always are like, \u201cOh, successful people wake up before everybody.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit. No. Night owl. All my best work: like 10 p.m. to midnight.",

        "content": "When Pennsylvania-based Morgan Properties bought a $500 million portfolio of apartments across the Midwest this spring, the region finally got the recognition that local industry players long thought it deserved.\nThis recent success in Chicago appears to have served as a bellwether for other Midwest markets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our share of problems, but Chicago to me has always been steady,\u201d Chicago-based multifamily broker Brad Feldman of Interra Realty said.\nThe odds on Morgan\u2019s bet were favorable. Rent in the Midwest grew 2.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, MMG Real Estate Advisors found. It was the biggest year-over-year increase in regions across the U.S. in the second quarter, and there\u2019s still room for growth. In that period, the region boasted the nation\u2019s lowest average effective market rent at $1,390.\nMorgan might have deep pockets. But locals have a leg up in benefiting from the Midwest\u2019s promising attributes, thanks to their knowledge of the region\u2019s nuances.\n\u201cI\u2019d say the lion\u2019s share of the deals go to guys that are based here,\u201d Feldman said.\nP\nolitics as usual\nWithin Chicago\u2019s city limits, multifamily investors are walking a delicate tightrope.\nThe region\u2019s strong rent growth and job market are enticing to investors. Still, stubbornly high interest rates and the city\u2019s shaky political landscape are giving them pause.\nHousing policies championed by Mayor Brandon Johnson and his allies, including an anti-gentrification ordinance passed on the city\u2019s Northwest side and an attempted mansion tax that was defeated at the ballot box, have stirred uncertainty for investors. And property tax reforms led by County Tax Assessor Fritz Kaegi are causing whiplash between initial appraisals and final values determined through the\nappeals process\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from institutional type people who say, \u2018talk to us when you get a new mayor,\u2019\u201d Kiser Group multifamily broker Andy Friedman said. \u201cIf we are to get a new mayor that is a Rahm Emanuel type \u2026 I think you would see floodgates open.\u201d\nDevelopers certainly feel the lack of institutional capital. Last year, Chicago recorded its lowest number of multifamily project completions since 2015, according to Institutional Property Advisors. With few deliveries expected this year, vacancy across the metro is below 5 percent for the second consecutive year.\nAlthough the slow pipeline is driving rent growth, it\u2019s also limiting the types\u00a0of buildings\u00a0listed. Older assets are dominating the market, but they\u2019re harder to manage from afar.\n\u201cThe city had a building boom in the 1920s. If you want to buy in Chicago, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s on the menu right now,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cBut it is not often that you see an out-of-state investor come in to invest in a building like that.\u201d\nOlder buildings on the city\u2019s edges present an opportunity for growth because they\u2019re selling for less than $200,000 per unit, unlike the high rises in the city\u2019s core, which are trading for more than $400,000 per unit.\nIn June, Jennifer Pritzker, president and CEO of Tawani Enterprises and cousin to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, sold a six-building portfolio for $45 million to local firm Silver Property Group. The sale of the 263-unit portfolio in the city\u2019s far north Rogers Park neighborhood came out to $171,000 per unit.\nSilver\u2019s principal, Ron Abrams, said that his firm has focused solely on Chicago since its founding 13 years ago. The company owns and operates 100 buildings in the city.\n\u201cBeing here and knowing all the players got us the deal and got us financing,\u201d Abrams said at the time of the purchase.\nSimilarly, Chicago-based investor David Pezzola bought a smaller portfolio of 110 units in the far South Side neighborhood of Beverly for $16.3 million this spring.\nAnd now, seasoned local real estate investor Stuart Handler is testing the hype by listing five midsize multifamily properties on Chicago\u2019s North and South sides.\nHigh-rise sales aren\u2019t at a complete standstill either.\n\u201cOur bidding activity is deeper and broader and better than it was 12 to 24 months ago,\u201d said Chicago-based CBRE multifamily broker John Jaeger, who specializes in selling high- rises.\n\nIn February, Jaeger\u2019s team represented the seller in a $94 million sale of a 20-story West Loop building. The buyer, Portland, Oregon-based real estate investment firm Green Cities, paid what came out to $421,000 per unit.\nAnd in April, Chicago saw the city\u2019s largest apartment sale in nearly two years. Local developer Moceri &amp; Roszak and equity partner Ares Management sold an apartment tower in buzzy Fulton Market for $170 million or $453,000 per unit.\nG\noldilocks zone\nIf an investor wants the economic prowess of Chicago but the political predictability of a smaller Midwest city, then the suburbs might be just right.\nWith easy commuter access via public transit, Chicago\u2019s suburbs benefit from the city\u2019s strong job market without its hectic political environment. And buyers have taken notice. Multifamily sales jumped 65 percent year-over-year in the city\u2019s suburbs in the first quarter of 2025, Interra found. Suburbs located outside of Cook County\nhave performed best\ndue to their more predictable property tax environment.\n\u201cOf these new inbound groups, 85 percent want non-Cook County suburbs,\u201d said CBRE broker Jason Zyck. \u201cThe suburbs remain the favorite location for investment.\u201d\nThe average price per unit in the suburbs rose 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, from $120,349 to $142,935, according to Interra.\nAn analysis by The Real Deal of 27 multifamily properties that sold for more than $10 million in the Chicago metro area late last year found that 17 traded at a markup from their last sale price. Of those, 11 were in the suburbs. That trend continued into the new year, Interra found.\nThere were seven suburban multifamily transactions in the $10 to $50 million range in the first quarter compared to just 13 in all of last year.\nMost recently, a venture of Chicago-based Laramar sold a 242-unit suburban Warrenville complex, the Westlyn, for $59 million or about $245,000 per unit. The buyer was Maryland-based Artemis Real Estate Partners.\nAnd lenders are shelling out for new developments too.\nChicago-based Banner Real Estate in July secured $124 million in construction financing for an apartment complex in the west Chicago suburb of Wheaton.\nM\nidwest momentum\nAfter cities such as Austin, Nashville and Tampa experienced a pandemic-fueled building boom, the Midwest quietly emerged as a potential safe haven for investors spooked by the Sun Belt\u2019s faltering fundamentals.\n\u201cThe Midwest did not get over their skis on development, as other parts of the country did, so in general, the Midwest has a healthy supply-demand balance,\u201d Jaeger said.\nAs Sun Belt cities became oversupplied and interest rates climbed, some deals quickly went south.\nIn contrast to the Midwest, the Southeast saw rents grow by only 0.4 percent, and the Southwest actually saw rents decrease by 0.9 percent, MMG found.\n\u201c[Institutions] that were very focused predominantly on the Sun Belt are seeing those negative trade-outs. They\u2019re seeing completely negative rent growth, where they\u2019re probably 20 or 30 percent below where their pro forma was on rents,\u201d Chicago-based CBRE multifamily broker Justin Puppi said. \u201cThey look to the Midwest, and Chicago specifically, and they see the rent growth and they\u2019re willing to accept that the circumstances are uncertain.\u201d\nDespite being smaller than Chicago, other Midwest cities can support investor interest without some of the complicated political hurdles Chicago faces, Feldman added.\n\u201cMilwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit have been popular with Blackstone and some other groups that are buying both single family and multifamily,\u201d Feldman said.\nAnd so far, supply hasn\u2019t outpaced demand.\nIn the Midwest, there were about 58,000 multifamily units under construction as of the second quarter of 2025 compared to 93,000 in the Northeast, 110,000 in the West and 235,000 in the South, Cushman and Wakefield found.\n\u201cOur debt costs are the same whether you\u2019re in the Sun Belt or you\u2019re in the Midwest,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cSo you can get positive leverage out of the gate, which is probably one of the only areas in the country where you can do that.\u201d",

The property spans more than 9,000 square feet and features eight bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a Moroccan-themed dining room and a roof deck with a bar.\nThe home first went\nup for sale\nlast fall but was soon taken off the market. It went back on the market when the Decorator Showcase began in late April with an asking price of $19.5 million.\nA quick change of hands could mean the home sold in an all-cash deal, according to the Standard.\nThe Pac Heights home underwent a makeover in anticipation of the showcase and had a buyer secured by the time the showcase closed in May. Every year, the Decorator Showcase takes place in a different home to highlight the work of various interior designers in each room. Most of the homes featured are in the city\u2019s priciest northern neighborhoods like Pac Heights, Presidio Heights and Sea Cliff.\nWhile the mansion sold shortly after being featured, the property spotlighted in last year\u2019s show \u2014 also in Pacific Heights \u2014 has yet to find a buyer. That Dutch Colonial home, built in 1899, has an asking price of $26 million. The house, located at 2898 Broadway, is still\non the market\nwith its original $26 million price tag.\n\nRevamping the Broadway property for the show presented unexpected \u201cchallenges,\u201d according to designer Geoffrey De Sousa, who leads the design board for the event and designed the living room in this year\u2019s Pac Heights manse. The five-floor home has no garage parking or elevator and the kitchen is in an unusual spot on the upper levels. It wasn\u2019t financially feasible to make those changes in time for the show.\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything beyond our abilities,\u201d de Sousa told the Standard. \u201cWe just need the time and money.\u201d\nAs seen with the latest Pac Heights sale, being featured in the showcase can have an \u201cextremely positive effect, both in terms of exposure and goodwill,\u201d according to Steven Mavromihalis of Compass, who has represented several Decorator Showcase homes in the past.\nBut a lot of eyes can also prove to be a hurdle for some.\n\u201cA lot of very affluent people would much rather not purchase a home that has been visited by thousands of adoring fans of architecture and design,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The former Marin County campus of the Birkenstock shoe company is headed for redevelopment as a world-class art and design museum.\nThe Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity, dedicated to the legacy of\nmidcentury designers Ray and Charles Eames\n, is buying the 88.5-acre property in Novato for $36 million, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nreported. The nonprofit currently operates out of a warehouse in\nRichmond\n.\nLocated at 8171 Redwood Boulevard, the 166,000-square-foot campus includes a 123,000-square-foot warehouse and a two-story, 43,000-square-foot office building. The warehouse will be repurposed to include office space for the institute as well as retail and restaurants next to various sculpture gardens and plazas.\nHow much it will cost to transform the site into a museum remains to be seen, though John Cary, president and CEO of the Eames Institute, believes it will be much more than what it\u2019s paying for the property, according to the Chronicle.\n\u201cWe love that it\u2019s this billboard, this iconic gateway into Novato,\u201d Cary told the Chronicle. \u201cThere is a lot of mystery and intrigue around it. We are just excited to turn it into a magical destination.\u201d\nThe acquisition of the Birkenstock campus is \u201ca transformational step for the Eames Institute,\u201d Cary said in a statement, calling it \u201cthe culmination of a long-held dream and our deep commitment to the North Bay community,\u201d per\nDezeen\n. \u201cThis extraordinary space will enable us to expand our programming and reach a broader audience, while serving as a permanent anchor for creativity and innovation in the Bay Area.\u201d\n\nTo bring the vision to life, the Eames Institute hired famed Swiss architecture firm\nHerzog &amp; de Meuron\nto design the redevelopment. Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s past Bay Area work includes the de Young Museum in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park.\nThe former Birkenstock property was built in 1964 as a distribution center for publisher McGraw Hill. The Eames Archives in Richmond currently has a tourist waitlist of nearly 1,000, and it has been as high as 4,000 since it opened in February 2024.\nThe hope is to attract 200,000 visitors annually once the new museum opens in 2028.\n\u201cOne of my dreams is to have big yellow school buses roll up here,\u201d Cary told the Chronicle. \u201cJust to blow little kids\u2019 pea-brain minds.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Members of the Menlo Circus Club rub shoulders over polo matches, tennis tournaments and galas on a former Atherton estate that traces its roots to 1920, when a group of children riding ponies put on a show for their parents.\nThe nearby neighborhood, which gets its name from the members-only club, played host to the Bay Area\u2019s priciest residential deal this year, a home at 81 Somerset Lane that traded in March for\n$51.5 million\n.\nWhile the closing hasn\u2019t opened the floodgates to $50 million deals, prices are generally ticking up in the area, brokers say. The tech industry is continuing to buy, fueling hope that the region\u2019s high-end listings may push past high interest rates and the finicky stock market.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum in the Bay Area towards tech\u2019s future and that\u2019s helping us for sure,\u201d Kevin Patsel, regional vice president for Compass Northern California, said. Compass topped The Real Deal\u2019s Bay Area ranking this year by a wide margin, closing $27.7 billion in volume across 14,751 transactions.\nThis year\u2019s ranking of the Bay Area\u2019s top 20 brokerages offers a more robust analysis of dealmaking in the region. Unlike previous years that offered a gauge of business in\nSan Francisco County\n, this year\u2019s list is expanded to also include Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma counties.\nTRD reviewed information from the Multiple Listing Service on the buy- and sell-side between May 15, 2024, and May 15, 2025, to compile the list. Deals in excess of $100,000 across condo, co-op, single-family and townhouse properties are reflected here, minus off-market transactions.\nLos Altos is a good example of how tech\u2019s presence in the Bay Area and specifically Silicon Valley is helping push pricing. The Silicon Valley suburb has seen $10 million trades become normal, according to Chris Trapani, Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno CEO and co-founder.\n\u201cIs $10 [million] or $12 [million] the old $7 [million] or $8 [million] a few years back? Maybe,\u201d he said.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno rounded out the ranking\u2019s top five with 1,814 deals and $3.8 billion in volume.\n\u201cNvidia just crossed a $4 trillion market cap,\u201d Trapani said. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone airlifted another Apple computer and dropped it in Santa Clara County, which is in the middle of Silicon Valley, so that\u2019s a ton of capital that employees and shareholders of that company have.\u201d\nGrowth of artificial intelligence employers could also help boost business.\n\u201cAI is beginning to influence the city, not just the actual application of it but the real estate,\u201d Jeffrey Gibson, executive vice president and Northern California regional manager of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said. \u201cLots of new people getting degrees from all over the country, if they have any interest in this [AI], this is the place they are coming.\u201d\nSotheby\u2019s ranked No. 7 in TRD\u2019s list with 1,125 deals equating to $2.7 billion.\n\nFundamentals\nOverall, the market is moving, even if stubbornly high interest rates haven\u2019t dropped like agents hoped. Other factors are helping: Inventory is up in the Bay Area, though much of it is moving in less than 30 days and prices are not dropping, according to Coldwell Banker Realty Western Regional President Jennifer Lind.\nA swing to more favorable conditions for buyers is just not happening.\n\u201cBuyers have been waiting for a long time,\u201d Lind said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for interest rates to drop. They\u2019ve been waiting for prices to drop. But there hasn\u2019t been a material change.\u201d\nColdwell Banker Realty sits in the No. 2 spot on the ranking with 8,901 transactions amounting to $15.3 billion in volume.\nThe rest of the top five includes No. 3 Intero Real Estate Services with $7.8 billion in volume across 4,457 deals. They\u2019re followed by eXp Realty with $3.9 billion in volume across 3,758 transactions.\nThe brighter picture extends \u2014 finally \u2014 to\ndowntown San Francisco\n.\n\u201cDowntown is still lagging behind a bit, but it\u2019s much better than it was a year ago. A year ago it was completely dead,\u201d said Gibson, who pointed to return-to-office policies as the partial driver.\nThe state\u2019s aspirations to boost density might also prove favorable in the long run for the residential industry, Trapani said.\nA 10.5-acre property known as The Vineyard, running along Allendale and Chester avenues in Saratoga, closed for $30.6 million in June. The buyer was a consortium of executives who proposed a 231-unit residential project that would include 85 townhomes and 24 single-family homes. It\u2019s one of more than 20 builder\u2019s remedy projects in a queue with the city.\nThe project suggests what the market may look like if cities and communities follow state guidelines on building new housing.\n\u201cWe know we need more units,\u201d Trapani said. \u201cThe question is how are these cities going to accommodate allowing for that while also keeping the peace for the existing neighborhoods.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty, promised his team a cruise to Cabo if it reached more than a billion dollars in sales this year. Getting on the water seems unlikely, but it isn\u2019t all bad news.\nDeLeon, whose team topped The Real Deal\u2019s Bay Area brokers ranking from May 2024 to May 2025 with 149 transactions totaling $785 million, explained that the second half of last year was strong, and it was hard not to be optimistic about 2025 after the election, when President Donald Trump\u2019s policies appeared favorable for Silicon Valley\u2019s economy. That was before so-called Liberation Day.\n\u201cThe tariffs were announced, and things kind of slowed down,\u201d he said. After stocks plunged, the technology world really pulled back from real estate.\nNina Hatvany, who leads Team Hatvany at Compass, No. 7 onTRD\u2019s ranking with 77 transactions totaling nearly $252.1 million, shared a similar sentiment, that buyers were all worried about what tariffs would mean for them so they put off buying.\nHatvany said San Francisco was having a great spring selling season and that her team had a number of $10 million-plus sales \u2014 until tariffs were announced. \u201cWe suddenly had this complete pause, where all the buyers were like, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Hatvany said.\n\u201cSilicon Valley feels like it\u2019s back.\u201d\nKen DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty, on the mood a few months after Trump\u2019s tariff announcement\nIt was a much more difficult market than what some in the local industry had experienced, according to David Gunderman, cofounder of the Gunderman Group with Keller Williams, No. 8 on TRD\u2019s list with 145 transactions totaling $221.4 million.\n\u201cThe tariffs, the sort of lurching economy, the drops and recoveries in the stock market, I think it just made people more cautious than normal during that spring time,\u201d Gunderman said.\n\nThe situation has since calmed, and the year keeps getting better, DeLeon said. \u201cWe had a very successful June, where one week we sold $50 million worth of homes or so,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley feels like it\u2019s back.\u201d\nHatvany said the mood in San Francisco has begun to recover, and her team happens to be having an active July, which is unusual for her. DeLeon has noticed something unusual, too.\nThe $15 million to $30 million market is the strongest it has been in years \u2014 reminiscent of early pandemic life \u2014 but the $2 million to $4 million segment, which tends to be the most frenzied, has cooled off. The success in the upper echelon may have to do with luxury real estate becoming a safety net for the wealthy amid stock market and geopolitical volatility. Such buyers sometimes pay all cash so they\u2019re not worried about interest rates. At the lower range of luxury \u2014 sub-$4 million \u2014 uncertainty and tech layoffs are sources of weakness.\nDeLeon is hopeful for what the rest of the year will bring. Still, the cruise isn\u2019t likely. Hatvany finds the market is unpredictable, despite the recovery she noticed.\n\u201cSome properties are going immediately over asking, some are languishing,\u201d Hatvany said, and it\u2019s difficult to decipher why. Nonetheless, Hatvany thinks it\u2019ll be a good rest of the year for San Francisco sales. \u201cWe\u2019re always very stock market driven, and the stock market is back up,\u201d she said.\nBuyers generally have more confidence than they did in the spring, the agents explained. Still, brokers are adjusting. Some are spending more on promotions for listings and marketing more broadly and only taking on realistic sellers, rather than those who are overpricing by $1 million, according to DeLeon.\nBecause interest rates are still high, \u201cyou have to really be on your game,\u201d Gunderman said, unlike periods when the market is so hot all you have to do is put up a for-sale sign and people line up with offers. Because the cost of buying a home is so high, the buyer pool has shrunk, and buyers who are looking are especially critical. \u201cYour home has to be really well positioned and prepared for sale in a way that is going to capture [the buyer\u2019s] attention, or else you\u2019re really going to suffer in your outcome,\u201d he said.\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

Details about the endeavor remain scant as discussions with the Nashville-based school are ongoing, though the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nconfirmed that Lurie has met twice with Vanderbilt leadership, as has\nNed Segal\n, the city\u2019s chief of housing and economic development.\nFormer Mayor London Breed announced\nintentions\nto build a historically Black college and university satellite campus in the city center as part of her\n30 x 30\ninitiative, designed to attract 30,000 students and residents to downtown by 2030. But the plans never came to fruition.\nLurie is hopeful, as Breed was about her plan, that Vanderbilt\u2019s expansion will revitalize the city\u2019s urban core.\n\u201cOur administration is working every day to create a clean, safe and thriving downtown \u2014 one that draws people, businesses and investments back to our city,\u201d Lurie told the Chronicle. \u201cWelcoming a world-class university like Vanderbilt to our city would bring new energy and foot traffic downtown, and we will continue working to make that happen.\u201d\nThe pending move follows a similar announcement last week in Los Angeles. The University of Michigan is\nplanning to set up its West Coast campus\nfor the Ross School of Business\u2019 Executive Master of Business Administration program at The Grand LA, a mixed-use complex in the heart of downtown.\nUnder the agreement, the Ross school will occupy 20,000 square feet on the third floor of the structure and build out classrooms, conference rooms, workspaces and indoor and outdoor event areas dedicated to the MBA program. For more than a decade, students flew into town once a month for a weekend of classes hosted at local hotels such as the Beverly Wilshire.\nBay Area hotel foreclosure sales top list of state\u2019s priciest transactions\nRumors of the Bay Area lodging market\u2019s death might not be greatly exaggerated.\nIn the year\u2019s first half, the average sales price per hotel room in Northern California was down 28 percent year-over-year to $129,500, according to a new report from Atlas Hospital Group cited by\nThe Mercury News\n. The region\u2019s hotel market has been\nplagued with foreclosures and loan defaults\nover the past year.\nTwo hotels in the Bay Area were the priciest hotel sales of the year so far, though both were foreclosure sales.\nEarlier this month, the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\nwent back to lender Invesco in a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million. In May, BrightSpire Capital\nbought back\nthe 541-room Signia by Hilton in downtown San Jose in a foreclosure that valued the property at $80 million. In third place in Atlas\u2019 report is another foreclosure in Southern California: The 397-room Line Hotel in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, with the foreclosure purchase by Corten Real Estate Partners placing its value at $68 million.\n\u201cThese three sales accounted for a total of [about $218.2] million of sales volume [in California], which is 15.7 percent of the entire dollar volume [of hotel sales] through the first six months of 2025,\u201d lan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, told The Mercury News.\nAI companies grab space in SF, Sunnyvale\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s foothold in the Bay Area continues to grow.\nIn San Francisco, AI-powered procurement platform Zip is moving into a 75,000-square-foot space at\n680 Folsom Street\nin South of Market\u2019s Yerba Buena neighborhood, which once housed Macys.com operations across 250,000 square feet. The lease more than quadruples the company\u2019s current footprint at 1 Sansome Street.\nFinancial services company Brex is also getting ahead of the AI curve as it doubles down on the technology in its products,\ngrabbing about 100,000 square feet\nat 270 Brannan Street after going headquarters-less and switching to a remote-first model in 2021. Similarly, software developer Postman is ramping up its AI-powered operations with the opening of a new 32,367-square-foot office in the Financial District.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Sunnyvale, AI-driven data and analytics giant Databricks leased 305,000 square feet across all seven floors at 200 Washington Avenue in downtown Sunnyvale, marking the company\u2019s third outpost in the Bay Area and 39th around the world. The company will be the first office tenant at the new Cityline Sunnyvale mixed-use complex.\nIn February, Databricks\ninked a roughly 150,000-square-foot lease\nat 1 Sansome Street in\nSan Francisco\nfor its new global headquarters. Databricks also has a 47,000-square-foot office at 351 East Evelyn Avenue in Mountain View, which it opened in 2020.\nApple continues Bay Area shopping spree\nApple has made its third nine-figure office purchase in the South Bay in the span of less than two months.\nThe iPhone giant is in contract to buy Kilroy Realty\u2019s Mathilda Campus in Sunnyvale for $365 million. It currently leases 581,429 square feet of the four-building, 663,000-square-foot complex. The deal, expected to close later in the third quarter, includes 505-599 North Mathilda Avenue and 605 West Maude Avenue.\nThe latest purchase follows last month\u2019s news that Apple bought 615 and 625 North Mathilda Avenue, located next door to the Mathilda Campus, for $350 million. It simultaneously dropped $166.9 million for the three-building, 220,000-square-foot Cupertino Gateway complex at 10200 North Tantau Avenue next to its Cupertino headquarters, which it was also leasing.\nApple previously bought a 10-building campus known as Apple Results Way, which it had been leasing since 2011, from Swift Realty Partners in 2023 for an undisclosed price. Later that year, the tech firm\nspent $70 million\non an office building at 10200 North De Anza Boulevard, down the street from a five-building complex that Apple\nbought in 2021 for $450 million\n.\nWells Fargo finds buyer for longtime SF HQ\nRedco is snapping up Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District.\nThe locally based real estate giant is under contract to acquire 420 Montgomery Street, months after a previous agreement with\nForge Development Partners\nnever came to fruition.\nForge planned to acquire the Montgomery Street building for about $135 per square foot, or $54 million, and convert the 13-story building into housing. Details around Redco\u2019s deal for the 409,000-square-foot tower, including price, were not disclosed, though it was reportedly more than what Forge would have paid.\nRedco is reportedly planning to keep the building for office use. Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters are currently spread across a T-shaped group of structures at the site with entrances on California, Leidesdorff and Sacramento streets.\nMosser offloads Nob Hill apartments after loan default\nSan Francisco real estate royalty Neveo Mosser\nsold\na Nob Hill apartment building after defaulting on a $14 million loan backed by JPMorgan that was tied to the property.\nA shell company linked to Cypress Capital Investments purchased the 75-unit mid-rise building at 1060 Bush Street for $16.5 million, or $220,000 per unit, earlier this month. The Mosser Companies CEO purchased the approximately 47,000-square-foot building in 2004 for $8.6 million.\nGarrett Brasseaux, founder of Cypress Capital Investments, is named in the deed, while Mosser is named as the grantor. The sale price was below the nearly $19.3 million asking price on the listing.\nSince its founding six decades ago, the Mosser real estate empire has acquired thousands of apartments in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles, growing its holdings to an estimated $1.5 billion in assets.\n",

        "content": "Multifamily properties will be crowding the auction block on Tuesday in Texas.\nThe 28 commercial assets facing foreclosure include nine\nowned by Houston investor Fercan Kalkan\n, the founder of Kalkan Capital, Bisnow first\nreported\n. In total, Kalkan could lose 3,000 units.\nLoan documents show he bought the properties between 2019 and 2023 when interest rates were low. That\u2019s when investors swept through Texas picking up aging apartment complexes with plans to revamp and sell them for a profit. Instead, interest rates ballooned and values sank.\nThe total amount of commercial loans headed to foreclosure ballooned to $670 million in August, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. July\u2019s list tallied just over $400 million.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with 17 properties totaling $430 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nLenders are circling Kalkan like vultures this month.\nSouthstate Bank, Thistle Creek Partners and Morgan Stanley have issued foreclosure notices regarding at least $140 million worth of loans tied to nine properties.\nHere\u2019s the list:\nVilla Nueva Apartments, a 542-unit complex at 5300 W. Gulf Bank Drive;\nLa Plaza Apartments, a 534-unit complex at 5909 Glenmont Drive;\nThe Pointe Apartments, a 517-unit complex at 4101 Shaver Street;\nVeranda Village, a 330-units complex at 3635 Shaver Street;\nLa Esencia Apartments, a 296-unit complex at 300 N.

Houston Rosslyn Road and\nBoth Timbers of Cranbrook Apartments and Retreat on Rosslyn Apartments have received foreclosure notices prior to this month but haven\u2019t been sold yet.\n\nKalkan filed for bankruptcy in relation to Retreat on Rosslyn, La Esencia and Timbers of Cranbrook in May, Bisnow reported. An attorney for lender Morgan Stanley said the properties posed safety hazards. The case was dismissed.\nSan Antonio\nAfter purchasing the property in 2022, First Capital Advisors is facing foreclosure on the Joseph at Huebner, a 192-unit garden-style apartment complex at 11660 Huebner Road in northwest San Antonio. Bridge Debt Strategies Fund IV provided the $31.2 million mortgage. The debt on the property built in 1983 works out to $163,000 per unit.\nDallas\nAs of July 24, no big CRE loans from Dallas County are hitting the auction block this month.\nFort Worth\nRed Summit Partners could lose a Tarrant County property to foreclosure on August 5. The firm appears to have defaulted on a $21.6 million mortgage from BDS Mortgage Capital for Flintridge Apartments Homes, at 2310 N. Collins in Arlington. The 186-unit apartment complex was built in 1979, and the debt amounts to $116,000 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the 17 foreclosures in Houston\u2019s Harris County, four properties (plus two Kalkan-owned multifamily assets) are regulars.

        "content": "Ray Johnston needed 26 handshakes.\nThe former Dallas Maverick and current country singer who entered real estate as a side hustle scored some prime land right outside Princeton, Texas, just before it came to be recognized as the\nfastest-growing city in the country\n. To sell to a homebuilder and turn a pro-grade profit on the first major deal of his real estate career, all Johnston needed was for neighboring property owners to approve easements for sewer lines.\nThat meant persuading 26 homeowners, many of whom had moved to Princeton precisely to avoid subdivisions, to let Johnston build.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Johnston shrugged, \u201cit\u2019d be somebody else.\u201d\nNorth Texas hay fields have been turning into neighborhoods for decades as Dallas grew north. Princeton, 45 minutes from Dallas in Collin County, is just the latest to benefit, or suffer, depending on who you are. Brokers and developers are mining in a gold rush, local business owners are enjoying a quickening marketplace and North Texans are finding quieter, more affordable neighborhoods with a closer drive to work in Frisco, Plano and Irving. On the other hand are the old guard, the people who\u2019ll say you used to see the Milky Way over Lake Lavon (now sentried by signs that say \u201cNo Fishing From Bridge\u201d) and the retirees in double-wides on two acres. Unaffected by the city\u2019s restrictions, but also lacking city infrastructure, their neck of the woods is the ripest for development, but it\u2019s work to get the land ready.\nEnter Johnston, a former loan officer and NBA athlete whose hard-won victory over leukemia and second life as a country singer have inspired several\nprofiles\nand a documentary funded by his old boss, Mark Cuban. Johnston\u2019s aw-shucksness can make it seem like he stumbled into the Princeton deal.\nTrue, besides a local\u2019s instinct, neither he nor the partners in his business, No Bad Days LLC, specifically foresaw that Princeton\u2019s population would double to 37,000 in the four years following his 2021 purchase of 138 acres, or that the local government would scramble to slow things down with a\ntemporary moratorium\non residential construction inside city limits that will have lasted more than a year when it expires in November.\nThough his scope is tiny compared to many of the Metroplex\u2019s projects, Johnston, for both his good timing and his understanding of the moment, carries the story of Princeton and places like it as much as anyone. Everyone knew white-collar Dallasites wanted bigger yards and smaller schools, but not everybody predicted quite how far they\u2019d be willing to stretch for them. Those that saw it are getting a payoff \u2014 and a lesson in Texas-sized growing pains.\n\u201cI\u2019m all in on DFW growing,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe only way this loses is if all of a sudden people start leaving Texas. Doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s happening anytime soon.\u201d\n(To be sure, population growth has slowed, and residential prices in some Dallas suburbs have been correcting, even as homebuilders and investors scoop up more deals.)\nSales prices aren\u2019t available in Texas property records and Johnston won\u2019t disclose how much he paid. But D.R. Horton paid about $70,000 per acre for unentitled land that became the Crossmill subdivision about five miles north of Johnston\u2019s tract, according to a company filing.\nG\nold medal growth\nThe population trend line of the\nDallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area\nhasn\u2019t taken a dent since the 1970s. The 2020 U.S. Census counted 7.6 million in the Metroplex; that went to 8.3 million in 2024 estimates. Behind the steady rise of the population, each new town it absorbs experiences a spike that, in Princeton\u2019s case, can get steep. Princeton cracked 5,000 residents for the first time between the 2000 and 2010 Census; it surpassed 10,000 by 2017. The Census estimated that Princeton had hit 37,000 people in July 2024.\nConstruction is everywhere, and rush hour traffic crawls. Straddling FM 3286, the most direct road to Dallas from Johnston\u2019s purchase, is a bait shop-feed store-gas station on one side and on the other, a fresh concrete pad patrolled by Caterpillar machines. (Caterpillar moved its\nheadquarters\nto Irving in 2022.) Construction crews have pitted all four corners of the intersection of FM 982 and Highway 380, one of the many traffic lights in a town that famously had but two in 2013.\nPrinceton\u2019s surge has made it a symbol of Texas\u2019 success but local reticence brought the attention of the\nstate legislature\n.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me, it\u2019d be somebody else.\u201d\nRay Johnston on the inevitability of development\nIts city council voted for the moratorium in September of 2024, to give the city time to pave roads and lay pipe. Infrastructure aside, a feud between local and state government is smoldering. State House and Senate leaders made it a priority to add affordable housing this year, and they aim to find it behind local red tape. Dealing a blow to those who\u2019d expand more gradually, new state laws take effect this year that trim municipal authority over neighborhood density, residential conversions and building moratoriums. Pressing pause now requires notices by mail and newspaper, two public hearings at least 30 days apart and a supermajority vote to pass. Moratoriums automatically expire after 90 days, and the city can only extend them to 180.\nAt a late June meeting of the Princeton council, with a moratorium extension on the agenda (it passed), resentment of the new regime seeped in.\nOne councilmember asked Assistant City Attorney Grant Lowry if there was a way to get an exemption to the new rule in case they wanted to extend again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my understanding,\u201d Lowry said, with a certain grimness. \u201cThe state is notorious for being developer-friendly and anti-municipality.\u201d\nThe development lockdown in Princeton\u2019s city limits has made county land all the more desirable. The problem is that it comes without infrastructure. Owners looking to sell to homebuilders must either assume the cost of bringing in roads, water and sewer lines, which means procuring easements from neighbors, or cut their asking price to pass this cost to the buyer. In a community with growing pains, the price of land and easements responds not only to demand but also to who\u2019s buying \u2014 a big homebuilding company or a friendly country singer.\nScouting for passive income\nAs Johnston tells his story over burgers at Park House, a club in Highland Park, it becomes clear that his Princeton play wasn\u2019t dumb luck. Between music gigs at billionaire Ray Hunt\u2019s ranch, chance friendships with the Scovells, hangouts with Cuban and apparently regular hunting trips with a rotating cast of ranch brokers, Johnston has spent years making connections with Dallas\u2019 most eminent players. He\u2019s just now leveraging them.\nJohnston lays out maps of his Princeton purchase next to our fries. A Sixpence None the Richer song is playing, and when it gets around to the chorus, Johnston slips into the harmony.\nLooking for a passive income source to support his musical career, Johnston acquired the land in 2021, he explained. Initially, he was scouting a good site for a boat storage facility on Lake Lavon after enjoying some success with a similar project near Tyler.\n\u201cI just wanted to invest in something that was passive, that could be somewhat recession-proof, because I was touring along with the band and I didn\u2019t have time to be there,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nThe land he bought comprises two tracts; a Collin County native named Willis Housewright owned one, and his sister-in-law Flo owned the other. Flo, who lives in Oklahoma, said Ray\u2019s personal touch convinced her and Willis to accept his offer.\n\u201cWe had been approached several times about selling, but Ray and several others at the same time presented us with different offers, and we decided to go with Ray and his partner at that time. We just had a good feeling about what they presented to us. And certainly financially, we had some demands that they readily accepted. Anyway,\u201d Flo said, \u201cit went very smooth. \u2026 He\u2019s an unusual person, business-wise, as well as just being a very kind, giving person.\u201d\nOf course, as Johnston remembers, the obvious question eventually occurred to Flo during their three-year correspondence: Why not call up Lennar?\n\u201cShe asked us, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t we just sell to the end seller?\u2019\u201d Ray recalls. He told her, \u201c\u2018That makes sense. But if you do that, you\u2019re going to do a lot of work to your land, like get water easements to bring water to your land; get sewer easements to bring sewer to your land. We\u2019re good at that, so that\u2019s why we want to pay you this.\u2019 And it was a lot of work to get easements to that land.\u201d\nNorth Texas hay fields have been turning into neighborhoods for decades as Dallas grew north. Princeton is just the latest to benefit, or suffer, depending on who you are.\nThat\u2019s an understatement, according to his business partners. Brant Landry and Clint Riley, partners at the Dallas firm Reserve Capital Partners, also have a stake in No Bad Days. Each met Johnston about a decade ago on a different hunting trip. There\u2019s a reason why some homebuilders avoid the entitlement process altogether, preferring to purchase land ready to build, they pointed out.\nClayton Snodgrass, principal at Bluebonnet Partners, and son-in-law of Celina magnate Rex Glendenning, had more of a nose for Princeton\u2019s potential than either Johnson, Landry or Riley. He\u2019s the one who convinced Johnston \u2014 the would-be passive investor \u2014 that the hustle would be worth it, seeing the potential to get ahead of the major homebuilders and increase the profit when he sold.\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Look, if you want to move this thing along as far as possible, you\u2019re gonna have to go door to door.\u2019 He did the knocking on doors and kissing babies,\u201d Snodgrass said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most easements that I\u2019ve seen a guy that\u2019s not a professional easement procurer go get,\u201d Riley added.\nAt each of the 26 houses, Johnston showed up with a gift certificate to a nearby store or restaurant, a business card shaped like a guitar pick, and occasionally his girlfriend.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re with a girlfriend, it\u2019s a little less sales, more civilized,\u201d he said.\nI\nSO: Water, wastewater\na\nnd police\nDallas isn\u2019t only swelling north. There\u2019s been healthy development south of the city for some time. Ellis County towns like Midlothian and Waxahachie have attracted the attention of players as big as Jerry Jones, Walton Global, RREAF Holdings and Cawley Partners.\nEven so, southern areas are the underdog, with low-performing school districts that belt the city to the south. Meanwhile, the northward expansion keeps going, the Dallas North Tollway reaching toward Oklahoma. Companies that relocate to the Metroplex overwhelmingly prefer the northern neighborhoods, with Toyota, KFC and State Farm in Plano, TIAA and McAfee in Frisco, Charles Schwab in Westlake and Raytheon in McKinney.\nIt\u2019s less sure which rural spot will become the next Princeton. Plenty of Texas cities have scrambled to offer tax benefits for commercial development in the hopes that employees will follow, even if they also encounter the typical growing pains.\nBut the issue of local control is a definitive wedge in Texas government, and municipal leaders chafe at statewide guardrails on their authority.\nJohnston needed his sewer easements, and as the Princeton moratorium winds toward its final deadline, the city is adjusting to the widening compass of Dallas\u2019 sprawl by making headway on an improved wastewater system and building a 3 million gallon storage tank. The police force is hiring, and new roads should redistribute traffic.\n\u201cThe city is making some progress,\u201d Lowry, the Princeton attorney, told the council in late June.\nT\nhe last 60 acres\nJohnston kept pursuing the 26 neighbors. After each easement chat, he\u2019d send a personalized gift basket, and eventually, everyone said yes. Growth might have been inevitable, but the landowners just outside Princeton didn\u2019t prefer someone else, it turned out. He got the easements he needed, and he\u2019s now sold two-thirds of the land.\nDollar Tree picked up 1.2 acres and built a store in February at the T-intersection on FM 982. Lennar\nbought\n32 acres last December and 43 this March. Another 16 acres are under contract now with an apartment development company. Johnston won\u2019t say how much he got for it.\nToday, the land is graded and plumbed for Lennar\u2019s upcoming subdivision. After a rain, contractors\u2019 bootprints overlapped with deer tracks in the mud. Decorative limestone pillars, the only structures except the new Dollar Tree, mark what will become the entrances to the development. For now, the view toward the lake is lush; it won\u2019t look the same when development starts.\nBut if it hadn\u2019t been Johnston, it would probably be somebody else \u2014 this is his refrain.\n\u201cMuch like music,\u201d Ray says, \u201cit was just timing.\u201d\nHe puts the conclusion less lyrically in the biography of his LinkedIn profile, which describes the land \u2014 the deals he\u2019s made and what\u2019s left to sell.\n\u201cSewer,\u201d his write-up ends, \u201carrives Dec \u201925.\u201d",

        "content": "Today, it\u2019s a broad expanse of prairie in the North Dallas growth path. But on this land, Imran Chaudhary wants to build a community he could move his parents to.\nThat\u2019s half the reason he gives for devising a plan to build a 400-acre city in Collin County (north of Dallas) around a mosque. By including single-family homes, apartments, schools and senior living facilities, the community would make multigenerational living possible in a region whose rapacious growth is putting one of its primary selling points \u2014 housing affordability \u2014 more and more out of reach.\nBack in Pakistan, where Chaudhary lived until age 19, his grandparents lived in his family home. EPIC City, named for the East Plano Islamic Center, could offer Muslim families in North Texas the opportunity to grow up like he did.\n\u201cIf something happens, you can go and take care of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we found that gap in the community that we live in \u2026 That was a charm that a lot of people bought into.\u201d\nThe other half of Chaudhary\u2019s reasoning for wanting to build EPIC City is practical. The project could generate income to sustain the mosque anchoring the community.\nThe idea reflects the rising prominence of North Texas\u2019 Muslim population to the extent that Dallas earned the moniker \u201cMedina of America\u201d after the Saudi Arabian city that\u2019s central to the Muslim faith.\nHowever, since news of the project spread, EPIC City has faced the scrutiny of local, state and federal officials, with Gov. Greg Abbott (who recently signed a law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments) taking notice and\ninitiating\na full court press against the development.\nAbbott has also taken to X to peddle claims that EPIC City\nwill enact Sharia law\n; that particular post was a retweet from Amy Mekelburg, an influencer and self-described \u201ccritic of Islam\u201d who has claimed the leaders of EPIC City are \u201cUsing Texas as the Blueprint for Sharia Domination.\u201d\n\u201cNone of that is true,\u201d Chaudhary said.\nPutting the outcry aside, Chaudhary\u2019s pursuit of the project comes as unaffordable housing and the isolation of suburban life have pushed religious leaders to propose a return to traditional European city design, where a church anchors the town.\nFrom Detroit to Northern Virginia to Naples, Florida, church leaders have entertained (to varying levels of success) the prospect of building towns around religious institutions, including churches and universities.\nIn light of this growing trend, the controversy surrounding EPIC City poses the question: Who\u2019s allowed to build a community?\nT\nhe promise\nThe opening of a YouTube video titled \u201cWelcome to EPIC City\u201d pans through the cloudy heavens until a mosque comes into view under the blazing Texas sun.\n\u201cA meticulously designed community that brings Islam to the forefront,\u201d the narrator says.\nBacklash against the community came in the form of accusations of discrimination. Since the video was posted in April 2024, leaders have backpedaled on the language they use to describe the project.\nAn earlier version of EPIC City\u2019s website describes it as \u201ca vibrant and inclusive community that serves the evolving needs of the Muslim community.\u201d The language has since been updated to describe the project as \u201ca vibrant, multigenerational and inclusive master planned community.\u201d\nAs Chaudhary and his partners navigate the public relations storm that EPIC has stirred, they\u2019re also operating as the city\u2019s developer.\nCommunity Capital Partners is the project\u2019s development entity, and it\u2019s led by Chaudhary and fellow directors Sarfraz Ahmad and Naveed Siddiqui. Ahmad, a custom homebuilder, is the one with real estate experience.\nCommunity Capital Partners purchased the land for EPIC City in 2024.\nThe property is a swath of unincorporated area within Collin and Hunt counties, meaning that the developer will be required to get county approval for the development. The counties regulate such matters as platting and infrastructure, but they don\u2019t regulate land use or density.\nCommunity Capital Partners is now in the fundraising stage, raising capital by selling about 1,000 shares of the company for $80,000 each. Purchasing a share allows the investor to reserve a lot at EPIC City and provides a 15 percent discount on the land. The only requirement is that shareholders must be accredited investors. So far, the entity has sold about 500 shares, which works out to $40 million.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that whatever we do, we do it right with the proper legal paperwork,\u201d Chaudhary said.\nDespite his best efforts, the financing structure they\u2019re using was the target of\na new law\npassed this legislative session.\nRepublican state Rep. Candy Noble of Allen, Texas, sponsored House Bill 4211. It requires that a housing development owned by a business entity must disclose to investors that they are purchasing shares of the company, not property.\nAbbott characterized HB 4211 as a law that would \u201ccrack down\u201d on communities like EPIC City.\nDespite pointing to investigations into the project by multiple state agencies (the Texas Workforce Commission, the Texas State Securities Board, the Texas Funeral Services Commission and the Department of Public Safety), Abbott has never directly said how EPIC City could be breaking the law.\nB\nack to basics\nArchitect Erik Bootsma became interested in the idea of traditional living when he was an undergraduate student at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California.\nIt\u2019s where he became a Catholic, got interested in traditional architecture and met people he counts among his dearest friends decades later.\nUnder the mentorship of Philip Bess at Notre Dame\u2019s School of Architecture and Milton Grenfell at Grenfell\u2019s D.C. architecture firm, Bootsma studied the urban planning of yore, holding up the church-anchored European village as a model for living well.\nThe impulse to self-associate is natural, Bootsma said, pointing to the ethnic enclaves created by immigrants in cities across the country throughout American history.\nHe recalls visiting Crown Heights, Brooklyn, on the Sabbath. He remembers seeing Jewish folks walking to the synagogue and socializing on neighbors\u2019 porches. He holds it up as one of his favorite places.\n\u201cIs it insular? Maybe. But it\u2019s also an actual, real community,\u201d he said.\nBootsma acknowledges that villages built around places of worship could err on the side of being overly homogeneous, and he noted the need for both balance and openness to life outside.\nIn 2008, Bootsma drew up a master plan for St. John the Beloved, a Catholic church in Northern Virginia, to transform the swath of empty land it owned into a village. Housing costs were on the rise, and building homes around the church would allow parishioners to live onsite.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got retirees who come to daily mass,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if they would come to daily mass by walking instead of driving?\u201d On the flip side, \u201ca young family would be able to afford an apartment or a small house there.\u201d\nMore recently, Bootsma has been working on a similar plan with St. Joseph Shrine in Detroit, where most parishioners commute to church. Building housing would allow them to be together more than an hour a week.\nNeither project has come to fruition. There\u2019s not really a template to work from, and, as a result, it\u2019s been challenging to square the financing details. But Bootsma is confident that someday some project will, and he\u2019s noticed a growing interest in these kinds of intentional communities.\n\n\u201cI think people are starting to see that the promise of the suburban experience is not what it was chalked up to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are finding that they are scattered and atomized. People have fewer and fewer friends.\u201d\nBootsma isn\u2019t the only one interested in working out the kinks. A movement called YIGBY, Yes in God\u2019s Backyard, has fomented in the last few years with the goal of creating a path for land-rich religious institutions to turn their valuable real estate into housing.\nA\nve Maria\nNo one\u2019s been more successful at building something like what Bootsma describes than Tom Monaghan, the billionaire founder of Domino\u2019s Pizza.\nIn search of a home for a Catholic university, he partnered with developer Barron Collier, which was sitting on a piece of undeveloped land 40 miles south of Naples, Florida.\nAve Maria was founded in 2005. Monaghan handled the university and the church. Collier handled the commercial development.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been basically in charge of this project from day one, and I\u2019m Episcopalian,\u201d said Blake Gable, CEO of Barron Collier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not some sort of dogmatic Catholicism thing.\u201d\nGable said he dealt with the typical NIMBY ilk in pursuing the project, but the prospect of putting a university in someone\u2019s backyard was \u201ckind of hard to complain about.\u201d\nBarron Collier secured about 80 permits at the county, state and federal levels before putting a shovel in the ground, he said. To raise funds for the project, Collier issued bonds and took out traditional loans.\nIt took five years, from the birth of the partnership to the day the first person moved into town.\nTwenty years into the development, it\u2019s halfway done and home to 11,000 people. There are walking trails, a water park, retail, health care, a manufacturing plant, schools, restaurants and even a Baptist Church.\n\u201cI truly believe that we have created a foundation that has all the things necessary,\u201d Gable said. \u201cWhatever happens from here on out, up to people who live there.\u201d\nCarole Carpenter, a broker with John R. Wood Properties who works in Ave Maria, described the makeup of the community as \u201c50 percent Catholic. The rest came because they want to play golf.\u201d\nThe Catholic part isn\u2019t something she discusses with prospective buyers unless they ask, Carpenter said.\nBut when they do ask, she has some incredible stories to tell them about how she moved to Florida to help start the university. For instance, she shares that the first house she sold in Ave Maria was the church\u2019s tabernacle \u2014 a $500,000 gift from a stranger who approached Carpenter wanting to make a donation in honor of her husband.\n\u201cThe town speaks for itself,\u201d she said. It certainly attracts all kinds of people, but, \u201cyou can\u2019t go into town without seeing this huge church.\u201d\n9\n0 miles yonder\nEPIC City\u2019s controversial arc draws a stark contrast to plans for a Catholic community just 90 miles away in Tyler, Texas.\nVeritatis Splendor, named for an encyclical from Pope John Paul II and that translates to \u201cthe splendor of truth,\u201d refers to a project born around 2021 that aims to \u201cbuild a flourishing community of Catholics\u201d in East Texas.\nThe project stalled with about 20 houses built after what current resident Stephen Handley, Veritatis Splendor CEO, aptly summed up as \u201cdrama.\u201d Pope Francis removed Tyler Bishop Joseph Strickland, a major proponent of the project, from his post. In addition, news broke of an affair between Kari Beckman, who was on Veritatis Splendor\u2019s board of directors, and Texas Right to Life\u2019s Jim Graham.\nAfter moving to the community in 2023, Handley teamed up with his neighbors to get the vision back on track with a grassroots push.\nHandley, who runs a software company, is approaching the project like a start-up. He\u2019s got the seed money for the first phase, which involves looking deeply into what\u2019s possible for the community in terms of infrastructure and utilities.\nBut he dreams big.\nVeritatis Splendor has 377 acres of developable land on which Handley and his neighbors would like to see a church, more single-family homes and a commercial district.\nHandley estimates that the community could cost $100 million. He\u2019s exploring different options for raising the money, he said, including selling shares of a company, selling bonds or taking out debt securities.\nIn comparison to Ave Maria, Veritatis Splendor is and will be a lot smaller, Handley said. The rural setting makes it possible for lots to span multiple acres. The community is unique in that there\u2019s a strong agricultural element, including a vast blueberry farm. One of Veritatis Splendor\u2019s pillars is education, and most residents choose to homeschool their kids.\n\u201cDay to day, it probably feels more like your traditional suburb,\u201d Handley said about Ave Maria. \u201cIn Veritatis Splendor, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever take on a suburbia feel.\u201d\nThe group spearheading the revival of the community has consulted attorneys about the process, including ensuring they don\u2019t run afoul of Fair Housing laws. No one is excluded, Handley said. But, the community\u2019s traditions, such as a nightly rosary walk, communicate the values of the people who live there.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being more explicit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018These are our values,\u2019 and we\u2019re not shying away from it \u2026 There\u2019s other reasons people are attracted to a community like ours, but we\u2019re putting our faith as that first reason.\u201d\nThe explicit mentions of Catholicism on the part of the community\u2019s leadership haven\u2019t drawn the same accusations of discrimination as EPIC City.\nThe Real Deal requested information related to investigations into either community from the entities Abbott mentioned. In the case of EPIC City, the entities claimed the documents were confidential. There were no documents related to investigations into Veritatis Splendor.\nS\nalvation?\nCommunity Capital Partners has yet to submit any plans for approval to Hunt or Collin county, but that could change soon.\nDavid Kalhoefer, an engineer hired by the developer, told Collin County commissioners in March that the group is in the process of conducting water, flood and traffic studies. The company plans to submit plans by the end of the year, Kalhoefer said.\nThe same meeting stretched to four and a half hours long; the room was packed with public commenters who showed up to register their opposition to the community, calling Islam a religion that \u201callows abuse to women\u201d and claiming that EPIC City would be the site of \u201chonor killings, stonings.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Community Capital Partners continues to fight accusations of discrimination from Texas leaders. So far, it\u2019s winning.\nIn early April, the group\nhired\nDan Cogdell, a well-known attorney who led the successful defense of Ken Paxton\u2019s impeachment trial, to respond to the investigations. Cogdell came out swinging, accusing Abbott of \u201cgubernatorial hate speech.\u201d\nAfter opening an inquiry on May 9, the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its investigation into EPIC City in a letter on June 13.",

        "content": "Texas\u2019 luxury highrise\ncondo market\nis not just a dream for developers. Institutional capital is buying in, too.\nHouston-based Satya Inc. landed a\n$255\u202fmillion construction loan\nfrom International Bank of Commerce to fund the state\u2019s first purely residential St.\u202fRegis Residences development. The debt translates to roughly $2.8\u202fmillion per unit.\nThe 38-story tower will rise at 102\u202f Asbury Street in the upscale River Oaks area and feature seven penthouses and 90 residences, with prices starting at $3\u202fmillion. The developer added another floor after bids reserving about 40\u202fpercent of the units piled in earlier this year.\nSpanning more than 40,000\u202fsquare feet, the amenities lineup includes a 26th-floor sky terrace with private dining and a cognac bar, wellness features such as cold plunges and saunas, a pet spa, yoga studios, co\u2011working spaces and full butler and valet service via Marriott\u2019s St.\u202fRegis brand.\nConstruction is slated to begin in the fourth quarter and wrap up at the end of 2027. Douglas Elliman is handling marketing and sales.\nSpeaking of capital, Hines secured\n$130 million in refinancing\nfrom Fannie Mae for the Victor, a 344-unit apartment tower at 3039 Nowitzki Way in Dallas. The financing highlights Uptown as a destination for luxury highrise living. It\u2019s located near the Katy Trail, Klyde Warren Park, the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, and the site where Goldman Sachs is building a $500 million office campus.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\nA rare public sale price was reported for a head-turning retail transaction. New York-based REIT Brixmor Property Group paid\n$223 million for LaCenterra at Cinco Ranch\n, at 23501 Cinco Ranch Boulevard in the Houston suburb Katy. The price amounted to $545 per square foot for the 409,000-square-foot open-air shopping center.\nIn the loss column, Fercan Kalkan\u2019s Houston multifamily empire is\nmired in distress\n. At least eight properties tied to Kalkan Capital and its founder are set for foreclosure auctions next week, following defaults on more than $125\u202fmillion in loans. Morgan Stanley and other lenders cite deteriorating conditions and unaddressed safety hazards at Kalkan\u2019s aging Class\u2011C apartment complexes in Houston and Pasadena.\nLakewood, New Jersey\u2013based Onyx Partners has a\ndeal to buy 119 JCPenney stores\nacross 30 states for $947 million.\nHome sales in master-planned communities\ndropped in the second quarter\n, along with the broader single-family market.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his estranged wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton,\nclaimed three homes as their primary residence\nin mortgage documents. Although the Trump Administration has been attacking enemies with\naccusations of mortgage fraud\n, the Paxtons are unlikely to be targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice, as MAGA allies. However, it\u2019s possible their lenders could require full payment as recourse.\n",

The properties spent about 162 days on the market, on average.\nTwenty-two luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,169 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 17 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $212.6 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the eight single-family homes and four condos under contract last week totals $96.2 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\n\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week had an average asking price of $8.9 million and spent an average of 164 days on the market. They totaled $71.2 million in asking dollar volume.\nTimbaland, whose legal name is Timothy Mosley, listed his 8,452-square-foot, seven-bedroom and eight-and-a-half-bathroom house at 5400 Hammock Drive in Coral Gables for $15.9 million in April. Diana Gutierrez of Mocca Realty has the listing. The record producer, rapper, singer-songwriter and label executive paid\nabout $9 million\nfor the 1-acre property in 2019, the same year the tropical modern mansion was completed. The property includes a guest house, wine cellar, sauna and full-house generator.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week had an average asking price of $6.3 million and spent 158 days on the market, on average.

        "content": "The Appraisal Institute, a major provider of licensing education and credentialing for real estate appraisers, reached a confidential settlement with former CEO Cindy Chance, ending a lawsuit that raised serious concerns about workplace misconduct and mismanagement.\nThe institute, headquartered at 200 West Madison Street in Chicago, denied the allegations in Chance\u2019s complaint, according to\nBisnow\n. In its weekly newsletter, the Appraisal Institute stated that settling the case was in the best interests of the organization, its members and the broader real estate finance industry. In a message to members, the nonprofit called it a \u201clearning experience\u201d and pledged to make improvements based on member feedback.\nThe settlement announcement did not include any financial figures.\nThe suit, filed in May in Illinois\u2019 Cook County Circuit Court, alleged that Chance was terminated after she reported several complaints from female employees about inappropriate behavior by Craig Steinley, a former Appraisal Institute president. Chance claimed that Steinley groped her and engaged in other misconduct, and that she was pressured to cover up the complaints.\nChance maintained she was trying to change the culture at the organization, according to\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\n.\n\nSteinley denied all allegations but eventually stepped down under pressure from the Appraisal Institute\u2019s board due to member backlash. He was removed as a defendant in June, after which Chance\u2019s attorney withdrew, leaving her without legal representation.\nChance joined the institute as CEO in September 2023 and was dismissed a year later. Her suit suggested a pattern of misconduct within the organization. The New York Times corroborated her claims, reporting that 12 women described uncomfortable encounters with Steinley and revealed a previously unreported $412,000 settlement the Appraisal Institute paid in May 2024 to its former CFO, who accused the organization of maintaining a \u201csexually hostile work environment.\u201d\nIn parallel to Chance\u2019s lawsuit, another former employee, Alissa Akins, filed a separate complaint alleging she was forced out after flagging irregularities in AI\u2019s continuing education exams. According to Akins, flawed scoring systems resulted in some unqualified appraisers passing and competent ones failing. The institute attempted to dismiss her suit, but the motion was denied and litigation continues.\nThese controversies come at a time when the broader appraisal industry faces significant challenges. The Appraisal Subcommittee, the federal agency tasked with regulating the industry, is under scrutiny from Congress amid allegations of mismanagement and staffing instability. A Bisnow investigation revealed budget cuts and leadership turmoil at ASC, culminating in the recent resignation of acting head Matt Ponzar.\nU.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Mike Rounds of South Dakota have called on the subcommittee to explain the alleged mismanagement, highlighting the agency\u2019s importance to the stability of both residential and commercial real estate markets.\n",

        "content": "Restaurant operators are driving New York City\u2019s retail comeback, giving rise to the new landlord mantra \u201cIf you can vent it, you can rent it.\u201d\nQuick-service chains, viral dessert shops and upscale cocktail lounges are snapping up space at a pace that\u2019s pushing availability to decade-long lows, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Retail availability in Manhattan\u2019s 11 busiest corridors dropped to 12.8 percent in the second quarter, the tightest market since 2014, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThat demand is spilling into previously non-restaurant spaces. Conversion costs to add kitchen infrastructure can hit six figures, but more tenants are ponying up to secure prime spots.\nRestaurants account for at least 35 percent of all leased retail square footage in the city over the last decade. The rise tracks with post-pandemic shifts in consumer habits: more dining out, app-driven ordering and a surge in food-centric social media content; spending on top delivery platforms hit a record $120 million in the first quarter, per city data.\n\nOperators are tailoring concepts to meet the moment. Cava, Joe &amp; the Juice and Naya offer frictionless app ordering; relative newcomers like Anita Gelato and BabySips wine bar lean hard into Instagram aesthetics. Frankie Solarik\u2019s BarChef in Midtown \u2014 a $43-cocktail concept with elaborate plating \u2014 books out its weekends weeks in advance.\nDespite the land grab, rents remain below pre-pandemic highs, thanks to the glut of second-generation restaurant spaces that hit the market after 2020\u2019s mass closures. But they\u2019re set to rise fast, especially in trendy neighborhoods like the East Village and the Lower East Side, where some listings draw double-digit offers in days.\nWhile e-commerce has impacted other retail sectors, restaurant real estate is proving resilient. \u201cThey\u2019re ecommerce-proof,\u201d said Steve Soutendijk of Cushman, noting that New York\u2019s roughly 29,000 restaurants remain impervious to the factors thwarting other aspects of the retail world.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Gyllenhaal purchased the unit for\n$8.6 million\nin 2017.\nThe buyer\u2019s identity is shielded by an LLC with an address in Los Angeles. Gyllenhaal bought the property with his Woodrow Trust, an entity registered to his business manager, Warren Grant, and used in another of his purchases, a Hollywood Hills home, in 2005.\nUnit 5J spans 2,900 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, according to a previous listing on StreetEasy.\n\nAmenities in the 53-unit conversion, developed by Metro Lofts\u2019 Nathan Berman, include a 24-hour doorman, indoor pool, roof deck and fitness center. Other features have earned it a reputation for being \u201cpaparazzi-proof,\u201d including an underground parking garage with valet service and a resident-only courtyard.\nGyllenhaal was one of many A-list buyers at the 19th-century book bindery-turned-luxury condominium. Among the latest deals at the building is actor Mike Myers\u2019 sale of Unit 5A for roughly\n$21 million\nlast year. Bill Gates\u2019 daughter, Jennifer Gates, paid\n$51 million\nfor a penthouse at the building, which once belonged to Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton, in 2023.\nThough the building frequently lands in the press for its star-studded trades, the developer and its architect, CetraRuddy, have faced\nbacklash from unit owners\nover alleged construction defects and code violations. The condo board sued Berman and others involved in the development in 2021, seeking $376 million in damages.\nThe complaint describes the issues as multiple leaks in the penthouses, a defective drainage system in the courtyard and improperly laid bricks. Berman and CetraRuddy denied the allegations. The litigation is still pending.\n",

        "content": "Rolling Meadows officials are looking to intercept some momentum of the potential new Chicago Bears stadium nearby to score a big real estate proposal of their own.\nThe suburban government is making a bid to recruit developers for a long-vacant, city-owned property that could benefit from the planned NFL team\u2019s redevelopment at Arlington Park, just 1.5 miles away.\nThe site at 3500 Wellington Court is kitty-corner from Rolling Meadows City Hall at the southeast corner of Kirchoff Road and Owl Lane. It belongs in the closest commercial corridor to the new stadium and officials see it as a prime opportunity for retail and dining development in anticipation of increased demand driven by stadium attendees, as\nreported by the Daily Herald\n.\nIn a newly released request for proposals, the city outlines its vision for the 1-acre parcel, encouraging retail and service uses including restaurants, brew pubs, microbreweries, microdistilleries and microwineries.\nThe request emphasizes the desirability of outdoor features including plazas, gardens, public art and seating areas to create an inviting pedestrian environment. However, the city discourages drive-through businesses and explicitly rules out proposals that are exclusively residential.\nThe effort to attract developers comes on the heels of a broader planning initiative for the Kirchoff Road corridor. In May, the City Council approved new zoning changes creating a \u201cTC\u201d Town Center district, which allows for higher-density, pedestrian-friendly development. This includes buildings up to 70 feet tall and parking areas located behind structures to support a more walkable and visually appealing streetscape.\n\nFull endorsement of the comprehensive 110-page Kirchoff Road Corridor Study has stalled due to controversy surrounding one of its key recommendations: reducing Kirchoff Road from five lanes to three.\nProponents of this \u201croad diet\u201d argue it would add public parking, slow traffic, and enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists \u2014 all of which could support more vibrant commercial development. However, local business owners and other opponents fear the changes would increase traffic congestion and harm their operations, according to the Daily Herald.\nThe city-owned Wellington Court site has remained undeveloped since the Great Recession derailed plans for a mixed-use condo project that was to include ground-floor retail. Now, the city hopes to revive the site with a new project aligned with its updated interest in the nearby sports venue.\nDevelopers can submit proposals by Sept. 30. A winning proposal will result in a property sale and a development deal with the city.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Cushman &amp; Wakefield is getting a new office \u2014 but only a few blocks away.\nThe brokerage giant signed a 130,000-square-foot lease at Paramount Group\u2019s 31 West 52nd Street, where it will relocate its New York office in late 2026, according to\nthe Commercial Observer\n. It will also take over leasing duties at the 29-story Midtown tower.\nCushman will occupy floors 11 through 15, a stack of contiguous space it says will enable a more collaborative and modern office layout. It\u2019s a return to 52nd Street after a 17-year run at Vornado\u2019s 1290 Sixth Avenue (in which it\noccupied\naround 180,000 square feet); prior to that, the firm held offices at 51 West 52nd.\nDetails regarding the duration and asking rent were not disclosed.\nNortheast regional president Todd Schwartz described the relocation as less about leaving 1290 than seizing the chance for a better footprint, one where internal staircases and a unified layout support a \u201cpeople-first\u201d design.\n\nThe firm tapped Perkins+Will to design the space, and its workplace innovation team is coordinating the buildout. CEO Michelle MacKay will be based at the location, which will also serve as a client showcase. Across the street, C&amp;W staffers will have access to Paramount\u2019s 1301 Sixth Avenue, including event and wellness spaces and the members-only Paramount Club.\nThe brokerage\u2019s decision to stay in Midtown wasn\u2019t incidental. Schwartz said the firm polled employees who expressed a clear preference to remain in the core \u2014 from Third to Seventh Avenue, and between Central Park and 42nd Street. With transit and client proximity top of mind, 31 West 52nd fit the bill.\nManhattan\u2019s office market\nembraced the summer heat\nlast month. Tenants inked deals for 3 million square feet in July, up nearly 11 percent from the previous month, according to a Colliers report.\nThe borough is on track for 40 million square feet of leasing activity by year\u2019s end, a level not seen since the pre-pandemic heyday of 2019, per Colliers. Manhattan\u2019s availability shrank to 15.2 percent, the lowest since January 2021. Sublet supply also continued its downward trend, hitting its leanest level in five years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The buyer also assumed a $60.5 million mortgage from JLL Real Estate Capital.\nDRA paid $279,467 per apartment.\nModera Skylar consists of two 20-story buildings and a five-story parking garage with a rooftop pool deck. The complex offers a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.\nBuilt in two phases, Modera Skylar\u2019s first 166 units were completed in 2013, records show. A partnership between Boca Raton-based\nMill Creek Residential\nand San Francisco-based Rockwood Capital paid $47.5 million for the 8.5-acre site in 2018. The joint venture completed the second phase consisting of 97 apartments four years later.\n\nIn recent years, Allapattah has seen a wave of new apartment projects with higher than average rents. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood is $2,500 a month, compared to $2,100 a month for Miami overall, according to Rentcafe.com.\nModera Skylar is about one block south from The Fifteen Miami, a nine-story project with 132 apartments that Fort Worth, Texas-based Olympus Property purchased for\n$45.9 million\n.\nTwo recently completed Allapattah multifamily projects by Lisette Calderon\u2019s Neology Development Group also scored major refinancings. In January, New York-based Apollo Asset Management provided a $84.5 million loan for The Julia Residences, a 14-story building with 323 apartments at 1625 Northwest 20th Street. The mortgage paid off a previous\n$78.2 million\nloan.\nLess than a month earlier, Miami Beach-based Starwood Property Trust, led by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, provided a\n$63.5 million\nmortgage for Fourteen Main Street Residences, a complex consisting of a 14-story tower and a five-story building with 237 apartments combined. The Starwood loan paid off a $57.5 million mortgage.\nThe Julia features one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging from $2,300 a month to $3,848 a month, according to Apartments.com. Fourteen Main Street Residences consists of one- and two-bedroom units, with rents from $2,231 to $3,216 a month.",

The sellers are two entities managed by Palm Beach Equine Clinic President Scott Swerdlin, founder Edward Wollenman, Robert Brusie and Robert Boswell, all equestrian veterans in Wellington.\n\nThe Palm Beach Equine Sports Complex last sold for $4.5 million in 2004, according to property records. The complex was built in 1979 and includes a range of equestrian facilities, including six riding arenas, barns totaling 336 stalls, a 17-acre pond, on-site apartments for staff and a private lounge for riders, its website shows. The facility is walking distance to Wellington International, the showgrounds that host the Winter Equestrian Festival, which is considered a significant perk among the village\u2019s equestrian buyers.\nBoth Stephen Orthwein Jr. and Peter B.

Stephen Orthwein Jr. is co-owner of Franklin Polo Academy in Franklin, Tennessee. Peter B. Orthwein also co-founded Thor Industries, the recreational vehicle company that produces Airstreams, Jayco and Hymer RVs. Records show he paid $5.7 million for a Palm Beach house at 202 Garden Road in 2017.\nWellington\nis the epicenter of equestrian sports in America, drawing showjumpers, polo and dressage riders to its winter and spring competitions. High-profile equestrians who train in Wellington include Bill Gates\u2019 daughter\nJennifer Gates\n, her husband Nayel Nassar, Steve Jobs\u2019 daughter Eve Jobs and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s daughter Jessica Springsteen.\nThe athletes fuel the village\u2019s market for luxury equestrian estates.

It\u2019s the third mall the landlord has lost to foreclosure in the last year, Syracuse.com\nreported\n.\nLast month, a judge approved the foreclosure of the mall, ordering the asset be auctioned off within 90 days or as soon as possible. Pyramid defaulted on a $26 million mortgage backing the mall last year, failing to pay its debt by the loan\u2019s maturity date.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland provided the mortgage in 2010. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas later assumed the debt \u2014 acting as a trustee for the commercial mortgage-backed securities the loan was folded into \u2014 and filed its foreclosure action on the mall last May.\nIn July 2024, a judge appointed a receiver for the property. Last month, a $26.5 million judgment was issued against the 630,000-square-foot mall; Pyramid declined to fight the foreclosure and agreed to the default judgment.\nAs one of Pyramid\u2019s smaller properties, the owner\u2019s degree of concern about losing the Aviation Mall may have been muted. Besides, there\u2019s plenty of other issues befalling the company.\n\nA year ago, Pyramid\nlost\nthe 470,000-square-foot, one-story Hampshire Mall in Hadley, Massachusetts, to foreclosure. The asset counted a tenant roster including JCPenney, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Planet Fitness and Cinemark Theaters.\nIn April, a New York state judge\ngranted a summary judgment\nto Wilmington Trust, which holds $418.5 million in debt backed by the Palisades Center in West Nyack. Wilmington Trust, acting as a trustee for CMBS bondholders,\nfiled to foreclose\non the 2.2 million-square-foot shopping and entertainment complex in 2023, claiming Syracuse-based Pyramid defaulted on the loan tied to the Rockland County property.\nAnd the same month, the Pyramid affiliate that owns Destiny USA in Syracuse \u2014 the crown jewel of its portfolio \u2014\ndefaulted on a $300 million mortgage\n. It failed to secure a loan extension when the maturity date of the mortgage came around the previous June, according to Pyramid\u2019s most recent financial statements.\nLenders have not come after that property yet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A luxury condominium tower in Houston\u2019s Tanglewood neighborhood will reflect a growing trend among developers: Catering to buyers concerned about power outages and extreme weather.\nNamed The Beverly, the project is a collaboration between developers RAMA Co. and G.T. Leach Constructors, according to a report by the\nHouston Chronicle\n. Located at 5010 Longmont Drive, the seven-story tower will include just six full-floor residences, each spanning over 4,300 square feet, with private foyers accessed via two elevators..\nMarketing for The Beverly emphasizes uninterrupted, secure living. Each unit will come with a whole-home 26-kilowatt Generac generator, connected to a natural gas line, capable of automatically powering the entire residence during outages. An additional generator will support critical building systems, including elevators and emergency lighting.\nThe secure power systems directly respond to demand for backup power solutions following major power outages in Houston during events like the 2021 winter storms and Hurricane Beryl in 2024.\n\nThe Chronicle said the systems, which cost between $13,000 and $40,000, have become a selling point. Data from the Houston Association of Realtors (HAR) shows that the number of single-family homes listing generators as a feature nearly quadrupled from 518 in 2018 to 1,928 in 2024. However, such systems remain rare in multifamily housing; as of August 1, only 10 condos or townhomes on the Houston market listed a generator as a perk.\nNancy Almodovar of Nan and Co. Properties, the brokerage for The Beverly, said the project appeals to those seeking a \u201clock-and-leave\u201d lifestyle \u2014 especially residents looking to downsize without leaving Tanglewood. The inclusion of full-home generators adds to a sense of safety and convenience, which she described as \u201celevated bunkers in the sky.\u201d\nWith prices starting at $3.5 million, the development aims to strike a balance between privacy and exclusivity. \u201cWe weren\u2019t interested in building as many units as possible,\u201d said RAMA Co. co-founder Amir Taghdisi. \u201cSix full-floor homes felt like the right balance of intimacy and luxury.\u201d\nThe Beverly marks the first condominium project for G.T.

        "content": "Embattled Paramount Group revealed the company is under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, months after telling shareholders it made millions of dollars in previously\nundisclosed payments\nto its CEO\u2019s companies.\nThe publicly traded company said the SEC is investigating the firm\u2019s disclosures related to executive compensation, perks, corporate asset use, related party transactions and conflicts of interest. The investigation will also look at controls and procedures related to those disclosures.\nParamount, a large office owner in New York City and San Francisco, disclosed the existence of the investigation in a filing with the SEC announcing its second-quarter earnings on July 30. Paramount said in the filing that it is cooperating with the SEC.\nThe investigation occurs as Paramount is under intense scrutiny from shareholders. It is also considering a possible sale of the company and has hired Bank of America as its financial advisor.\nAn inquiry by the SEC is not much of a surprise. Earlier this year, Paramount revealed it paid millions of dollars to companies controlled by its CEO, Albert Behler.\nThe payments to Behler\u2019s outside companies were previously undisclosed to public shareholders and were only revealed by Paramount this year. The expenditures included over $3 million to a private jet company in which Behler owns a 50 percent stake. Paramount also spent over $900,000 on Behler\u2019s personal accounting services between 2022 and 2024.\nIn addition, Paramount paid over $200,000 for a company controlled Behler\u2019s wife to design a lounge at Paramount\u2019s 1301 Sixth Avenue office building. In February, the firm inked another $225,000 contract with Behler\u2019s wife\u2019s design firm.\nParamount also spent $12,000 for wine from Behler\u2019s German vineyard, while Behler racked up $77,000 more than the company\u2019s allotment for club memberships.\nPublic companies are required to report related party transactions over $120,000 under SEC rules.\nBehler\u2019s undisclosed payments were tacked on to his impressive compensation package of $20.2 million in 2023.\nAfter news broke about the undisclosed payments, Paramount announced a major shakeup in leadership. Wilbur Paes, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Gage Johnson, Paramount\u2019s general counsel, are leaving the company. Board member Katharina Otto-Bernstein and daughter of Paramount founder Werner Otto, has also left.\n\nParamount parted with its outside legal counsel Goodwin Procter, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe company said it is undergoing a review of strategic alternatives, which could include a sale.\nParamount previously rejected two bids to sell the company in 2020 and 2022 for as high as $12 per share. Paramount\u2019s stock is trading much lower, at $6.28 by end of day Monday.\nDuring its second-quarter earnings call, only one analyst asked about the SEC investigation.\nBehler said the investigation was related to certain \u201chistorical disclosures.\u201d He said he did not expect it to have any \u201csignificant impact at all to the strategic review.\u201d\nBut the investigation has already cost the firm in legal fees.\nParamount disclosed in its SEC filing that it has reached an indemnification agreement with Wilbur Paes, the former COO, CFO and treasurer, to reimburse Paes for certain costs incurred by the investigation. These costs included fees paid to Paes\u2019s lawyer totaling $274,000 during the first half of 2025.\nIn the SEC filing, Paramount said it is \u201cunable to estimate the likely outcome of this matter, or a reasonably probable range of potential costs or exposure, or the potential duration of the process, at this time.\u201d\nIn a statement, the firm did not address the investigation or the payments to Paes. Instead, a spokesperson said, \u201cfollowing a successful first two quarters marked by strong leasing activity, we remain focused on our strategic review in order to maximize shareholder value.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One week after four people were shot and killed at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue, police officers stood outside the office high-rise as employees trickled in and out of the building.\nThe chaotic scene that unfolded last week was replaced by one of quiet but clear increases in security Monday morning: A New York City police officer stood in the building\u2019s expansive plaza, staring out at Park Avenue. Another officer stood within the lobby, by a pillar that offered a view of the revolving doors on Park Avenue and 51st Street. Building staffers were stationed near the building\u2019s other entrances and within the lobby.\nLast Monday, Shane Tamura, 27, walked into the Park Avenue tower with an assault rifle. Police say Tamura opened fire and killed three people in the lobby:\nWesley LePatner\n, the chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust; NYPD officer Didarul Islam; and Aland Etienne, a security guard. Officials believe Tamura was targeting the National Football Association, which has its headquarters in the building, but mistakenly took the elevator to the 33rd floor, where Rudin has its offices. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the killings, police officers and other security personnel could be seen outside office buildings throughout Midtown. Beyond such immediate signs of extra attention to workplace safety, building managers and companies are also considering longer-term changes.\n\u201cUnfortunately, when something like this happens, it forces you to rethink everything,\u201d said Dave Komendat, founder of Seattle-based Komendat Risk Management Services.\nBuilding owners are reevaluating their security measures and staffing levels, and reviewing emergency communications systems they have in place. For example, RXR told\nTRD\nthat the company is reviewing and updating its shelter-in-place, lockdown and evacuation protocols and conducting security and emergency assessments at all of its properties.\nThe shootings will likely prompt building owners and tenants to consider incorporating more security technologies, such as strategically placed duress buttons that allow front desk staff or individual tenants to immediately contact emergency personnel. Lobbies can incorporate natural cover and concealment, in the form of concrete benches, planters or the security desk, Komedat said.\nNewer class A buildings often already have advanced elevator systems that limit floor access or allow the elevators to be remotely disabled. For buildings that already incorporate security technologies, it may involve ensuring tenants know the proper protocol and that building staff are aware of the full spectrum of available safety features.\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t realize we already have this kind of locking system, or we have the ability to program our elevators,\u201d said Peggy Phillips, who leads Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s protective design and security practice.\nSome buildings incorporate rooms that can be locked or blockaded in an emergency. High-profile companies might opt for more extreme options for their C-suite, including bunker-like safe rooms reinforced with steel plates, Phillips said.\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, Mayor Eric Adams noted that the Park Avenue tower has bathrooms that double as safe rooms, with bulletproof doors. He credited those rooms with playing \u201ca major role in not having a greater loss of life.\u201d\n\u201cThere were many things that Rudin Management put in place to make their tenants safe,\u201d Adams said.\nA representative for the company declined to comment on any additional security measures the firm is taking.\nJohn Orloff, who leads security risk management for Jensen Hughes and is a former inspector with the U.S. Secret Service, said dual authentication is key: Meaning, tenants are required to verify their identity at multiple points in order to gain access to different parts of a building. Maybe a tenant uses one form of identification at the turnstile, but another to access a specific floor from the elevator or to enter an office once on that floor.\nActive shooter training is also critical, he said.\n\u201cOur kids are better trained in knowing what to do with an active assailant than most of their parents,\u201d he said.\n\nEmployees should also refrain from entering public spaces with their office ID cards in visible or easily snatchable places, he added.\nCamera technology that uses artificial intelligence to identify potential weapons can provide even just a few seconds of additional warning to police, especially in cases where witnesses do not immediately call 911.\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t trust what they see,\u201d Komendat said.\nTamura double-parked his BMW on Park Avenue and walked across the large plaza outside the Park Avenue high-rise, carrying the rifle. The shades in the building\u2019s lobby were down to block the sun, and Tamura\u2019s approach went unnoticed,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nPhillips said she works closely with architects when designing an office building\u2019s lobby to establish clear sight lines for cameras and building personnel to monitor who is approaching the building.\nOf course, making changes to an existing office building is different from working with the blank slate that ground-up construction offers. Phillips advises her clients to install flexible infrastructure that allows the magnitude of security features to be adjusted. That could take the form of a temporary ballistic shield for the front desk, or if renovating the lobby, installing equipment that allows for turnstiles to eventually be built to block off certain areas from the public.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all been in office lobbies where they\u2019ve added equipment after events, and it\u2019s become like an obstacle course,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think the other thing that you learn from each of these events is that it is never quite like the last one,\u201d she continued. \u201cBeing able to recognize that the threat condition does change, and that having that flexibility to either toggle up or toggle down your security is beneficial because you are not put into a position where you have security protocol that is more onerous than necessary or not sufficient.\u201d\nOrloff warned against drastic changes to workplace security. He said it is important to make employees feel that their safety is top priority, but also to roll out changes in a measured way.\n\u201cYou have to make incremental cultural changes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go from having an open door policy to locking the place down.\u201d\nBuilding owners, managers and tenants cannot possibly prepare for every kind of disaster. Last week\u2019s tragedies show that even modern office buildings fortified with high-tech security solutions, security staff and\ntraining sessions\ncan be vulnerable.\nHigh-profile office tenants often have their own safety protocols and will have a separate front desk and elevator bank. Phillips expects security to be a greater emphasis on office security going forward, but also a heightened \u201cawareness that there are threat scenarios that could affect a wider range of people.\u201d\nKomedat said property owners will likely face increased pressure from tenants to increase security.\n\u201cIt always comes back to money,\u201d Komedat said. \u201cThose building management companies that want to attract and retain tenants will look at this very seriously.\u201d\nOthers won\u2019t want to make the investment.\n\u201cClearly, there will be landlords and management companies that will look at this and think this probably won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cHope is not a strategy.\u201d\n\u201cBut these things cost money,\u201d he added, \u201cAnd some will spend it and others won\u2019t.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The precise stroke of a pen is bringing an end to a lease for one commercial tenant.\nLandlord Soloviev Group won a case against a kosher deli that has been leasing the ground floor of its Billionaires\u2019 Row building. The case has dragged on for a decade, and an appeal is now on the table after a judge this week sided with the landlord\u2019s claim that signatures at issue in the case had been forged.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a tenant just give you a fake lease,\u201d said Alexander Estis with Rosenberg &amp; Estis, representing the plaintiff. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why our client fought it for so long.\u201d\nThe deli, Great American Health Bar, signed a 20-year lease with the building\u2019s former owner in 2000. In 2006, the landlord, then called Solow Management, bought the property at 35 West 57th Street through an LLC for $24.4 million. At one point the landlord claimed the tenant defaulted on the lease, which the deli fought in court.\nIn 2014, the restaurant produced another amendment. This one was allegedly signed by the former owner before the sale. That document said the lease could continue until 2040 under certain conditions. But by the time the document was brought to light, the former owner and signatory had died.\nLawyers for the landlord argued that the document was fake. It wasn\u2019t disclosed during prior litigation about the lease and only was revealed after the former owner\u2019s death, making it too good to be true.\nDefendants instead painted a picture of a wealthy landlord desperate to get a tenant out by any means necessary. If the document was forged, it wouldn\u2019t have been five pages, including terms unfavorable to the tenant, lawyers for the deli argued during trial.\n\u201cThere has just been a multitude of litigation because this landlord is on a tirade to get this last building, the last tenant,\u201d defendants lawyers said during trial, \u201cso they can demolish it and have a demolition site on this property.\u201d\n\nBoth sides retained handwriting experts. Despite disagreements about other matters, the two came to similar conclusions that the potentially forged document was not signed by the same person who signed two other documents.\nIn her decision, Judge Margaret Chan also cast doubt on the deli owner\u2019s testimony that he witnessed the owner sign the disputed amendment, which contradicted earlier statements.\n\u201cThe only logical conclusion is that the Disputed Amendment is a forgery,\u201d Chan wrote in her decision.\nMichael Terk, a lawyer for the defendants with David Rozenholc &amp; Associates, said his team believes the decision was an error and they are pursuing an appeal.\n\u201cMost of what is at issue is facts that are not referenced in the decision at all,\u201d he said.\nLawyers for Soloviev said they were not privy to any development or demotion plans for the property.\n\u201cThe case stands as a lesson to tenants,\u201d said Norman Flitt, an attorney with Rosenberg &amp; Estis representing the plaintiff. \u201cNo matter how elaborate your contrivance may be, truth will come to bear.\u201d\n",

JLL\u2019s\nGuthrie Garvin\nand\nJonathan Hageman\nmarketed the site\n, touting it as one of the next residential conversions in New York.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential:\nJake Gyllenhaal\nparted with a three-bedroom condominium at\n443 Greenwich Street\nin Tribeca for $14 million. The Academy Award-nominated actor paid\n$8.6 million for the pad in 2017\n. The new buyer is an LLC with an address in Los Angeles. The unit spans 2,900 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $4,800 per square foot. The sale appears to have been an off-market deal.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential:\nLiam Neeson\nsold his place at the Park Millennium building at\n111 West 67th Street\nin Lincoln Square for $10.3 million. The buyers were\nMartin Zetterberg\nand\nJoanmarie Land Zetterberg.\nThe residence spans 4,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

Coleman Real Estate Group\u2019s\nMatthew Coleman\nhad the listing, which first went live in February with an asking price of $12.8 million.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn the Flatiron District, a development site at\n10 West 17th Street\ntraded hands for $16.2 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAnbau\nand the buyer was an affiliate of\nProsper property Group\n, which took on $11 million in financing for the deal from a company tied to\nNorthwind Group\n. The seller bought the site, now vacant, a decade ago from the Catholic Medical Mission Board, and reportedly had planned to build a 17-story residential tower there.\n\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nThe\nNew School\nsold a townhouse at\n21 West 11th Street\nin Greenwich Village for $10.3 million \u2014 about half its original asking price. The 20-foot-wide property dates to 1850 and stands five stories tall. The New School put the home on the market in March 2024 for $20 million. Leslie J. Garfield\u2019s\nMatt Lesser,\nMatt Pravda, Tori Landon\nand\nMatthew Lipsky\nrepresented the seller. The buyer was a trust connected to\nMichael B.

        "content": "It is go time for the Midtown South rezoning. Will the City Council leave the plan intact?\nOn Wednesday, the City Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises and the Committee on Land Use will vote on the proposal to rezone 42 blocks in the Manhattan neighborhood.\nThe rezoning is projected to pave the way for 9,700 housing units, with up to 2,890 set aside as permanently affordable units.\nIf approved as proposed, this would be the first time that the city has mapped\nnew residential districts\nthat allow housing projects to be 15 or 18 times larger than their lot sizes. As part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the city created R11 and R12 residential districts, where residential space can have a floor area ratio of 15 or 18, respectively. The change was made possible when the state lifted a restriction that capped residential space at 12 FAR last year.\nThis would also mark the first time that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing is used in Midtown Manhattan.\nDuring a hearing last month, City Planning addressed a proposal to reduce density in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area, where the city wants to allow 18 FAR residential space. The proposal calls for 12, which the agency said would result in a 55 percent loss of housing.\nLocal City Council members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers have been supportive of the rezoning but also\nechoed concerns\nabout the fashion industry businesses (manufacturers and wholesalers) getting pushed out by property owners who are keen to demolish their buildings and cash in on the upzoning.\nA watered-down version of the rezoning would not bode well for the future of these residential districts in other parts of the city. If you can\u2019t make R11 and R12 districts work in a \u201cdense, busy, transit-rich part of Midtown,\u201d as the borough president\npreviously put it\n, where can you?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What changes, if any, will the City Council make to the Midtown South rezoning?

        "content": "One of the biggest tenants in Chicago\u2019s Willis Tower, law firm ArentFox Schiff, is close to signing a lease renewal that will trim its office footprint by more than 50 percent.\nThe law firm\u2019s cutback adds pressure to Willis Tower\u2019s owner, Blackstone Group, which has worked to preserve the value of the property amid reduced demand, rising interest rates and a massive loan maturity.\nThe law firm is expected to lease just over 75,000 square feet across three floors, down from the more than 168,000 square feet it currently occupies, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The new lease would extend well beyond the current deal\u2019s expiration in July 2028, marking a significant recommitment to the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper despite ongoing challenges in the downtown office market.\nThis downsizing reflects the broader trend of reduction driven by post-COVID shifts in workplace strategy. Remote and hybrid work have prompted companies to reassess their real estate needs, contributing to more than 2.3 million square feet of negative absorption in Chicago\u2019s central business district office market over the past two years.\nThe downtown office vacancy rate has hit record highs every quarter for the past three years, according to brokerage CBRE.\nWhile some professional service firms such as Bain and Sargent &amp; Lundy have expanded their downtown workspace, ArentFox Schiff\u2019s move highlights a continued struggle for landlords as long-term leases signed before the pandemic come up for renewal.\nThe law firm\u2019s downsize comes as separate appraisers take different approaches to how the\nWillis Tower\u2019s 103rd-floor tourist attraction known as the Skydeck\nshould count toward the value of the building, as estimates produced by both the public and private sectors in recent months have ranged from $999 million to $1.4 billion.\n\nEither way, the building is either\nwell below the value of its $1.3 billion mortgage debt\nor just barely treading water, depending on how the Skydeck\u2019s value is incorporated.\nBlackstone acquired the property in 2015 for $1.3 billion and invested an additional $500 million in renovations and retail enhancements. The building was appraised at $1.8 billion during a 2018 refinancing. After securing a loan maturity extension earlier this year, Blackstone now has until March 2030 to restore the tower\u2019s value and recoup its investment.\nThe 110-story skyscraper\u2019s office space was 87 percent leased as of January 2025, with United Airlines as the largest tenant, occupying nearly 666,000 square feet through 2033. Other major tenants include Morgan Stanley and law firm Seyfarth Shaw, both of which have options to reduce their presence in coming years.\nArentFox Schiff was formed in a 2022 merger between Arent Fox and Schiff Hardin and orchestrated by chairman Anthony Lupo. The combined firm reported more than $629 million in revenue last year.\nCBRE\u2019s Mark Cassata, Kyle Kamin and Dan Persa are negotiating the lease on behalf of the law firm, while Telos Group\u2019s Nikki Kern, Jamey Dix and JD Parcheta represent Blackstone at Willis Tower.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

But developer ICON hopes to relieve the market pressure by 3D printing houses.\nThe Austin-based builder recently launched its latest project in the city\u2019s Mueller neighborhood, according to\nMySA.com\n. The project put three one-bedroom 3D-printed homes \u2014 each about 650 square feet \u2014 on the market on July 31.\nMore two- and three-bedroom houses will soon go up for sale as part of the Mueller Affordable Homes Program, which aims to make living in Austin more accessible. The program is supported by The Mueller Foundation, which provides affordable housing.\nThe new homes are designed for income-qualifying individuals who make up to 80 percent of area median income. They feature open-layout living, dining and kitchen areas on the first floor, and bedrooms and bathrooms on the second. The developer\u2019s goal is to offer efficient, comfortable housing without compromising on modern design.\n\nThe ICON website features 3D Mueller homes with customized design touches and \u201cblended natural materials.\u201d The company\u2019s appeal to eco-friendly buyers includes the use of low-carbon concrete in the homes. Its technology also includes robotic cranes to layer the concrete in 3D-printed structures.\nThe website did not disclose pricing for the affordable one-bedroom models, but two-bed houses list at $965,000 and three bedrooms cost $1.3 million. The website shows the company has sold seven units in the project.\nMueller, a master-planned community in central Austin, offers access to Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center, Austin Film Studios, The Thinkery museum H-E-B, and the Austin ISD Performing Arts Center. Catellus Development Group is the master developer for the project, with ICON and other companies, including Muskin Builders and David Weekley Homes, active on the site.\nICON\u2019s foray into 3D-printed homes involves more than Mueller. The company also developed the world\u2019s first 3D-printed hotel, El Cosmico in Marfa, and is selling homes in Wimberley Springs and Wolf Ranch in Georgetown.\n",

RFR is demanding $1 million in base rent, deferred rent, and additional charges, according to the suit filed in state Supreme Court. The landlord is also seeking $25,000 in legal fees.\nRFR says Club Monaco stopped paying rent in the lead-up to its exit \u2014 despite multiple amendments to the lease dating back to 1989 and a recent seventh amendment inked as recently as January. RFR served a Notice of Default to the store manager in June, but that didn\u2019t seem to move the needle, the complaint says.\nClub Monaco\u2019s owner, private equity firm Regent, L.P. did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An RFR spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe once-buzzy fashion brand, known for its minimalist luxe aesthetic, has been retreating from brick-and-mortar retail in recent years. Regent, L.P. bought the brand from Ralph Lauren Corporation in 2021 and spent the next year stabilizing the business, chief merchandising officer Courtney O\u2019Connor told\nWomen\u2019s Wear Daily\nlast year.\nThe company closed its Vancouver flagship and several other locations, according to news reports. Club Monaco is being sued by the owners of Westfield Valley Fair Mall for allegedly failing to pay rent for nine months there, according to the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\n.\nRFR sold the office portion of 160 Fifth Avenue to nonprofit Simons Foundation for $185 million in 2018 but retained the retail condo. The 19,000-square-foot space is being marketed for lease by a Retail by MONA team led by Brandon Singer. The New York Post\nreported in January\nthat the asking rent is $450 per square foot.\n",

The 8-acre site would include 15,000 square feet of retail, 23,800 square feet of restaurants and 116,610 square feet of outdoor space.\nBoth parcels will have three partial subterranean parking levels as well as about 1 acre of publicly accessible open space.\nOnce completed, the Cesar Chavez Foundation would own and operate all of the affordable units at Buena Vista.\n\nLincoln first proposed such a project, then named the Elysian Park Lofts, in 2017, though it underwent changes following community feedback, according to the Buena Vista website.\nIn 2021, when the project reemerged as Buena Vista, public comment submitted to the city\u2019s Planning Department included dozens of letters of concern from community groups as well as the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s Office of Environmental Health and Safety. At the time, LAUSD said it could cause environmental impacts at the nearby Castelar Elementary School including traffic jams to street closures.\nThe L.A. Chinatown Community Land Trust submitted a public comment to the developers arguing that 200 affordable units is \u201cinsufficient\u201d for the project as roughly 20 percent of its planned housing units. The group also noted that the project could limit access to Los Angeles State Historic Park, located across from the project.\nWith Lincoln\u2019s draft environmental impact report submitted, the next step in the process is another round of public feedback before the city considers a path forward.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Currently, the 317-foot-tall Genesis North Tower in South San Francisco holds the title, though it could be outdone by N17\u2019s proposed 458-foot-tall building as part of its Willow Park mixed-use development in Menlo Park.\n\nMecah\u2019s plans call for 379,200 square feet above ground, including 174,700 square feet of housing and 119,760 square feet of commercial space. Underground, there would be two basement levels with parking space for 171 cars and 283 bicycles. The building would include ground-floor retail, housing on the lower 10 floors, and offices on the top four floors, including access to a rooftop balcony.\nFor the housing portion of the building, Mecah is looking to build 236 rental units, 36 of which would be deed-restricted as affordable housing. Half of those units would be for very low-income households and 18 would be set aside for moderate-income households. In San Mateo County, very low-income is\ndefined\nas $67,700 for one person and $96,700 for a household of four; moderate-income is generally $156,750 of annual income or less for one person and $223,900 for a household of four.\nResidents of the property would be able to take advantage of on-site amenities like a private lounge, spa, fitness center and a golf simulator.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The restaurant, which will open in late fall, will wrap around the northwest corner of 72 Park.\nHoy and Mirarchi launched Ezio\u2019s last year as a pop-up inside their original Roberta\u2019s, a pizzeria known for its wood-fired Neapolitan-style pies in New York\u2019s Bushwick neighborhood.\nFounded by Mendy Chudaitov, Lefferts completed\n72 Park\nin March, marking the first new luxury condo tower in North Beach in more than five years, according to the release. The tower, which allows short-term rentals, is 97 percent sold.\nLefferts, which Chudaitov started in New York,\nexpanded\nto South Florida in 2019, where it\u2019s focused on North Beach with plans for\nthree\nmore residential towers.

Since then, he\u2019s worked to secure new tenants.\n\nMost recently, The Bungalow by Gypsy leased 4,600 square feet at 1300 Clare Avenue, according to Francis X. Scire Jr., the landlord\u2019s broker. The tenant, which will open in December, will be a sister shop to the existing Gypsy Life Surf Shop at the Warehouse District. Both stores are owned by Tracy Smith.\nAlso, construction firm Marker opened a 1,400-square-foot office at 1250 Elizabeth Avenue; and Bindu Yoga &amp; Wellness opened a roughly 4,000-square-foot studio at 1530 Elizabeth Avenue, Scire said. Furniture and home decorations store Show Pony Palm Beach leased 13,000 square feet in two spaces: a store for its more traditional furniture at 1400 Elizabeth Avenue, and a store for outdoor furniture and sculptures at 1035 Clare Avenue.\nScire, who also is handling leasing for the\nNora District\nin downtown West Palm Beach, is representing Griswold in the retail leasing. Constance Thomas of TCRE is representing the landlord in the office leasing.\nThe new deals come as food hall Grandview Public Market closed its Warehouse District space.\n\u201cWe are now working on redeveloping the food hall. Our goal is to bring in a full-service restaurant,\u201d Scire said.\nThe district\u2019s occupancy is about 80 percent, he added.\nThe Warehouse District was developed from 1925 to 1968 along the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which in the 1920s carried tourists and South Florida newcomers eager to settle in the state, according to the district\u2019s website. The warehouses were formerly used as machine shops and distribution centers.\nIn 2018, Palm Beach-based Johnstone Capital Partners completed redevelopment of the long-neglected warehouses and sold the properties to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Asana Partners for\n$18.5 million\n.

        "content": "South San Francisco is shaping up to be a bright spot for housing construction in the Bay Area amid stagnant progress in the region.\nThree large-scale apartment projects are in the works in the Peninsula city, signaling a forthcoming increase in housing capacity for the region, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nLast month, Trammell Crow Residential\nsecured\na $183 million construction loan from Kennedy Wilson for its Alexan Icon project, a 480-unit apartment complex at 1587 and 1588 San Mateo Avenue. Demolition of six commercial buildings on the site was completed early last year and the site remains flattened, according to\nSF Yimby\n.\nOnce completed, the Alexan Icon will feature two 85-foot-tall structures; one building will span 455,860 square feet with 294 units and the other will comprise 287,230 square feet with 186 units. Of the 480 total, 60 will be deed-restricted as affordable housing. There will also be 16,670 square feet for shared amenities and roughly 227,000 square feet for the 560-car garage, as well as parking for 480 bicycles.\nResidents will have access to amenities like a resort-style pool and spa, club lounges, coworking space, bars and top-floor lounges.\nThe Alexan Icon project follows two other developments that have broken ground, according to Nell Selander, the city of South San Francisco\u2019s economic and community development director. Syres Properties is building nearly 400 units at 410 Noor Avenue near the South San Francisco BART and Caltrain stations. Essex Property Trust is developing nearly 550 units at 7 South Linden Avenue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant that South San Francisco has three large multifamily developments underway,\u201d Selander said.\nConstruction of new apartment buildings nationwide is at its slowest pace in 15 years, according to Jesse Gundersheim, senior director of market analytics with CoStar. So far this year, 2,344 apartment units in the Bay Area started development, roughly on pace with last year. Contrast that to stronger years when developers have launched 3,000 to 4,000 units in a single quarter, according to the Business Times.\nDevelopers reportedly attribute the slowdown to higher interest rates, tighter lending standards and increased construction costs, with each unit costing about $600,000 to build while typically selling for $350,000, per the Business Times.\nIn South San Francisco, the spike in construction might partially be related to other multifamily developments that have leased well, Selander told the Business Times. The success of projects at 401 Cypress Avenue, 988 El Camino Real and 200 Airport Boulevard, which were all developed during or after the pandemic could potentially ease lenders\u2019 worries about funding development, Selander said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "South Florida developer and longtime real estate attorney, Isaac Kodsi, died last weekend at the age of 59.\nIsaac founded and led Ark Capital Group, a Pembroke Pines-based real estate investment firm that specializes in debt and equity for projects that are under $50 million.\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the unexpected passing of Isaac Kodsi,\u201d according to a statement from a family spokesperson. \u201cWe ask for privacy and respect for Isaac\u2019s family as they navigate this difficult time.\u201d\nKodsi is survived by his wife, Teresita Kodsi, four children and his siblings, who include his brother, developer\nDan Kodsi\n. No cause of death was revealed.\nIsaac Kodsi was completing construction of\nArbor Residences in Coconut Grove\n, a condo project that he acquired out of foreclosure in 2023, and was working with two of his adult children, Joseph and Camilla, at Ark Capital.\nHe\nlived in Coconut Grove\n, where he also founded and ran Shake Wellness in his backyard. It\u2019s a trampoline-based fitness class business. Arthroscopic surgery to fix a knee injury left him with chronic pain and he decided to try jumping on his kids\u2019 trampoline.\n\u201cI knew right away that a trampoline workout was a game-changer that needed to be developed and brought to market,\u201d Kodsi told\nVoyage MIA\n.\nShake Wellness was designed to be accessible for many people, Kodsi has said.\n\n\u201cThis is a place of possibility, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d he said in a video he posted on social media last week. \u201cI don\u2019t care your shape, I don\u2019t care the age, I don\u2019t care what condition you\u2019re in. I don\u2019t care what you are, who you are.\u201d\nKodsi started Shake Wellness after practicing real estate law in Florida for nearly 30 years, working on sales contracts, developer rezonings and construction projects. When the recession hit, he purchased non-performing loans and repositioned the assets backed by those loans.\nKodsi attended Boston University for his undergraduate degree and attended St. Thomas University for law school.\nIn 2023, he acquired the Arbor property at 3034 Oak Avenue in Miami from the previous developer. Kodsi returned the original buyers\u2019 deposits and paid the contractor and subcontractors that had been working on the building. Had the lender foreclosed on the\nCoconut Grove\nsite, the buyers likely would not have received their deposits back. He hired Sandra Moss from Cervera Real Estate to relaunch sales, and the project is more than 50 percent sold.\nThe Kodsi family spokesperson said that a contingency plan is in place, and the development is moving forward as planned.\n\u201cArbor was a true passion project for Isaac, he cared deeply about creating something lasting and meaningful for the neighborhood he loved,\u201d according to the statement.\nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.\n",

        "content": "The San Antonio Board of Realtors recently split from its local MLS in a bid to avoid legal liabilities in the wake of a legal challenge that wrought changes to the hand-in-glove relationship between brokers and the listing service.\nSABOR and SABOR MLS issued a press release on July 23 to inform members and affiliates of \u201ca strategically planned transition that will establish each organization as an independent entity.\u201d The press release invites members to inquire further about the change, but it articulates no reasons behind it other than an effort for greater clarity and growth.\nSABOR communication director Taylor Fellows attributed the move to the National Association of Realtors settlement of a case that successfully challenged long-held standards on commissions and which party pays them in a residential deal. Fellows said the local group expects new efficiencies as a byproduct of the move.\n\u201c\u2026With the NAR settlement from last year and everything, it just helps protect the association to be separate entities,\u201d Fellows said. \u201cThe other really positive reason too is speed to market. When an MLS needs to move quick, and decisions need to happen, in terms of programs or different types of technology within the MLS, the structure of the association can slow it down.\u201d\nThe change is unlikely to affect the day-to-day work of member agents, according to Fellows and San Antonio area agents. Tyler Moore of Sage Oak Realty and Kelley Martin of Keller Williams Legacy both said they didn\u2019t notice the change last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been business as usual,\u201d Moore said.\nSABOR MLS isn\u2019t the first service to uncouple from its associated real estate board in the wake of\nNAR\u2019s historic 2024 settlement\n. Shortly after NAR settled in court, two Denver chapters sold REcolorado, one of the nation\u2019s largest MLSs, in an effort to avoid antitrust litigation. Closer to SABOR\u2019s home, the Austin Board of Realtors also separated from its service, Unlock MLS, earlier this year.\n\u201cThe industry is actually going in this direction. A lot of associations have separated,\u201d Fellows said.\nFellows emphasized that SABOR maintains a stake in the MLS, and that the two operations have been largely independent for some time.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the same building; we\u2019re still targeting similar missions and goals. It\u2019s just two separate entities. And it\u2019s actually been operating that way since 2020; we\u2019re just establishing the governance structure,\u201d Fellow said. \u201cAn agent gets two separate bills already, one for MLS quarterly dues and then an annual for the association. So it\u2019s really just an effort to streamline the focus of both.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Gindi family positioned themselves to redevelop the site of the one-time Century 21 flagship in Bay Ridge, only to recently trade the site.\nThe Gindis\u2019 ASG Equities sold the property at 458 86th Street in Brooklyn to a joint venture of MCB Real Estate and Osiris Ventures for $47.5 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The sale ends a marketing process that\u2019s unfolded over nearly a year.\nThe deal for the 95,000-square-foot retail hub penciled out to roughly $500 per square foot.\nMCB and Osiris are planning to redevelop the site for a $100 million investment. A grocery-anchored retail development would take the place of the former Century 21 site, which has sat vacant for a half-decade since the onset of the pandemic.\nA JLL Capital Markets team including Ethan Stanton, Jeffrey Julien and Brendan Maddigan arranged the sale. MCB and Osiris aim to start the redevelopment process by year\u2019s end.\nThe Century 21 that stood in Bay Ridge dated back to the 1960s, but was facing the wrecking ball for years.\n\nIn 2022, ASG\npurchased\na 12,500-square-foot lot at 472 86th Street for $12.5 million, capping an assemblage of all of the lots on the block. The firm planned to demolish the buildings in the assemblage and develop a retail complex expected to span 150,000 square feet.\nCentury 21 filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2020 and shut all of its stores. But ASG purchased the intellectual property of the brand out of bankruptcy for $9 million and reopened a smaller flagship store at 22 Cortland Street in the Financial District two years ago.\nLast month, a joint venture of MCB Real Estate, Fetner Properties and Farallon Capital acquired a Fort Greene multifamily development at 240 Willoughby Street from the Rabsky Group\nfor $209.5 million\n. Leasing was launched at the Brooklyn building around Memorial Day in anticipation of the acquisition.\nAround the same time, Osiris and CIM Group bought 190 Berry Street in Williamsburg from LENY\nfor $55.7 million\nout of bankruptcy. The mixed-use property includes a 40-unit apartment building and a retail component.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The listing, which includes the furniture, comes as the owners \u2014 the family of the late fitness magnate, Lucille Roberts \u2014 have yet to find a buyer for the five-story property, which has been up for sale since the fall.\nThe mansion, built in 1915 for the daughter of \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d store mogul Frank Woolworth, hit the market in November for $59 million, though its asking price dropped to just under\n$50 million\nin March.\nThe Roberts first sought to offload the home in 2011, when they listed it for $90 million. The family pulled it off the market two years later without a deal and rented it in 2021 for $80,000 a month.\nRoberts and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, renovated the 20,000-square-foot home after purchasing it for $6 million in 1995. Roberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, died in 2003.\n\nThe 35-foot-wide townhouse has nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms and features a solarium, wood-paneled library, an elevator and rooftop lounge.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin has both the rental and sale listing.\nThe property joins other Upper East Side mansions also on the hunt for renters, including a Gilded Age mansion at 4 East 64th Street asking $175,000 a month. The Lenox Hill property hit the market in April with a monthly asking rent of $150,000.\nIn Carnegie Hill, a 16,000-square-foot mansion owned by former Lehman Brothers executive Robert Millard is on the market asking $85,000 a month. The home at 9 East 88th Street has been on the market for sale since 2021, asking\n$38 million\n.\nDemand for luxury rentals rose at the start of the year, as economic uncertainty sparked by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and persistently high interest rates kept some would-be buyers on the sidelines. Between January and April, 300 apartments asking more than $20,000 a month were rented, a 30 percent uptick compared to the same period last year, according to data from UrbanDigs.\n",

All three properties tied to the loans are owned by Hilson Management.\nThe loans \u2014 originally issued by Flagstar Bank \u2014 are backed by 185 Madison Avenue, 5 West 37th Street and 349 Lexington Avenue. The deal closed June 27 and was recorded Aug. 1; all three transactions were executed through an entity tied to Hines Rialto Credit Partners.\nThe largest note, $35.2 million, is secured by the 71,00-square-foot building at 349 Lexington Avenue in Murray Hill. A $34.5 million note is tied to 185 Madison Avenue, an 80,000-square-foot office property, and the third, for $30 million, is backed by the 83,000-square-foot building at Five West 37th Street.\nFlagstar Bank, the seller of the notes, has previously held debt on all three properties. Signatories for the transaction were Jeremy Schwalbe for Hilson and Eric Green and Liat Heller for the Rialto and Hines joint venture.\n\nRialto and Hines did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIn the fall, the two companies held the initial close on a targeted $2.5 billion commercial real estate credit fund, PERE Credit\nreported\n. They raised roughly $700 million by first close and quickly started deploying capital, geared towards originating loans backed by high-quality office buildings across the country.\nThe latest debt acquisition comes as Manhattan\u2019s office sector continues to face elevated vacancy and limited refinancing options.\nHines, based in Houston, recently\nlanded $450 million\nin fresh financing for the 1.2-million-square-foot office building it co-developed with Ivanhoe Cambridge in the Texas city.

        "content": "Hockey star Patrick Kane, a longtime mainstay of the Chicago Blackhawks who now plays for the Detroit Red Wings, has sold his Gold Coast condominium for $6.4 million in an off-market deal.\nThe transaction, finalized in late June, marks another example of prominent athletes exiting the\u00a0 once star-studded tower at 9 West Walton Street in Chicago, based on reports by the\nChicago Tribune\nand\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nKane purchased the four-bedroom, 4,776-square-foot condo on the building\u2019s 25th floor in 2019 for $6.46 million, meaning he sold it at a roughly 1 percent loss. The unit was held in a land trust, shielding both Kane and the buyer from direct public association, though the trustee, Jeffrey Zaluda of Kilpatrick Townsend law firm, was named in public records.\nOn the buyer\u2019s side, Coldwell Banker agent Chezi Rafaeli represented the anonymous land trust. Nancy Tassone of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented Kane in the deal.\n\nKane\u2019s modest loss on the Walton Street unit pales in comparison to the nearly $1 million hit he took on Chicago real estate earlier this year, when he sold a Trump Tower condo for $2.1 million after purchasing it for $3.1 million in 2016. Kane still maintains a $5 million, 5,900-square-foot Greek Revival home in Lake Forest, which he purchased in 2022 shortly before his trade to the New York Rangers.\nThe\n9 West Walton building was once a magnet for pro athletes\n, but the trend has reversed in recent years. Kane\u2019s former teammate Jonathan Toews, who now plays for the Winnipeg Jets, sold his unit in 2019 for nearly $7 million. Former Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward sold his for $7.2 million in 2020, and ex-Bears linebacker\nKhalil Mack\nsold his in 2022 for $6.9 million. Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who bought Mack\u2019s unit, now has it listed for the same price.\nBillionaire Ken Griffin also exited the tower. In late 2024 and earlier this year, the Citadel CEO sold the tower\u2019s top four floors \u2014 including a rooftop pool deck. The top two floors and pool area were sold to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his wife MK Pritzker for $19 million, while the two floors below were sold on the same day in multiple land trust deals totaling nearly $16 million. It\u2019s unclear if the lower two floors that Griffin sold were purchased by the same buyer but the transactions for each closed on the same day with land trusts of similar names.\nKane played for the Blackhawks from 2007 until 2023, leading the club to three Stanley Cup championships. He played in nine NHL All-Star Games. In addition to his Chicago properties, Kane at one time owned a palatial home on the shores of Lake Erie in Hamburg, New York near his native Buffalo. He sold it in 2019 for $2.5 million.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Fort Worth-based M2G Ventures plans to enter the hospitality sector, its first major move beyond industrial and mixed-use retail.\nFounded in 2014 by sisters Jessica Miller Essl and Susan Miller Gruppi, the development firm\u00a0 has hired Chris Hanrattie \u2014 a seasoned hotel investment executive formerly with Crescent Real Estate \u2014 to lead the new vertical as managing director and head of hospitality,\nthe Dallas Business Journal\nreported.\nM2G has a strong track record in urban redevelopment, having acquired 5.1 million square feet of real estate and turned $1.6 billion in sales. Notable projects include Fort Worth\u2019s Foundry District, which it sold in 2022, and the Mule Alley redevelopment in the Fort Worth Stockyards.\nThe firm is also involved in a\n$1 billion expansion\nof the historic Stockyards. The project hit a snag when M2G\u2019s development partner California-based Majestic Realty Company became embroiled in a legal dispute with the head of its Texas operations, Craig Cavileer. He left the company this spring.\nThe leap into hospitality aligns with M2G\u2019s broader mission to \u201cinspire evolution through impact and innovation,\u201d said Essl. She emphasized the company\u2019s affinity for mixed-use environments, where hospitality naturally complements retail and other asset classes.\n\nHanrattie supervised the acquisition of 23 hotels totaling more than $2 billion during his time at Crescent. At M2G, he will focus on acquiring hospitality properties in high-growth Sun Belt markets such as Texas, Georgia and Arizona. His strategy targets underperforming assets that could benefit from rebranding, repositioning or new management, especially \u201csoft brand\u201d hotels that integrate into their communities \u2014 like Fort Worth\u2019s Hotel Drover.\nHanrattie sees growing demand for hotels that offer immersive experiences beyond lodging. Whether luxury or select-service, successful investments should blur the lines between lodging, retail and local culture.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the wave of the business going forward,\u201d he told the Business Journal.\nWhile no deals have been finalized, Essl confirmed that M2G is actively evaluating potential acquisitions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to tread lightly,\u201d she said, hinting that the firm\u2019s first hospitality project will make a bold statement.\nThe Miller sisters are identical twins who have focused on adaptive reuse, historical redevelopments and industrial property development.\n",

        "content": "Integra Real Estate offered $20.5 million for a sprawling Pembroke Pines condo complex in receivership, setting the floor price for an upcoming auction of the distressed property.\nMiami-based\nIntegra\n\u2014 led by Nelson Stabile, Paulo Tavares de Melo, Victor Ballestas and Cory Yeffet \u2014 was selected as the stalking horse bidder for Heron Pond, the 25-acre complex at 8400 Southwest First Street, according to a purchase and sale agreement included in court filings.\nThe stalking horse bid breaks down to $820,000 per acre.\nThe property consists of 19 two-story lakefront buildings with 304 condo units. Embattled Heron Pond, which had been the subject of multiple unsafe structure city notices and allegations of mismanagement against former board members, was put under the\nreceivership\nof Daniel Stermer last year. Shortly after that, the entire complex was evacuated due to structural safety concerns.\nIntegra was one of five bids that resulted from Avison Young and Fisher Auction\u2019s marketing, and offered the highest and best offer, Stermer said in a statement.\nCurrent zoning allows for a 321-unit project with one or multiple buildings up to eight stories or 100 feet tall, whichever is less, according to an analysis of the land completed by Greenspoon Marder attorney Dennis Mele. A developer would have to secure site plan approval and a plat note amendment.\n\u201cThe marketing and sale team will now return to the marketplace with this stalking horse bid in an effort to entice other parties to become qualified bidders so that we have a vibrant auction,\u201d Stermer, a consultant and former mayor of Weston, said in his statement.\nThe auction is scheduled for Sept. 25.\nIn 2023, the\ncity\ndetermined that six buildings and 26 units in seven other buildings were unsafe and ordered them evacuated. After Stermer took over as receiver last year, he found that prior evaluations of damage and repair costs were underestimated, according to his court filings. Last summer, all residents remaining at Heron Pond were\nevacuated\nfollowing ACG Engineering Services\u2019 determination that the buildings have hidden deficiencies due to inadequate design and construction.\n\nStermer decided to proceed with the\ntermination of the condo association\nand\nsale\nof the property last year. In a court filing, he cited the high cost of repairs and \u201csubstantial damage and destruction\u201d that can\u2019t be repaired \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time.\u201d\nHeron Pond was developed in 1988 as an apartment complex and converted into condos in 2006.\nIn past lawsuits, Heron Pond unit owners alleged some board members purposefully mismanaged the complex to allow it to fall into disrepair, with the goal of purchasing more units at a discount.\nIn his statement, Stermer said the five bids came from \u201cindependent third parties that have no prior relationship with Heron Pond.\u201d\nLast week, Broward Circuit Court Judge David Haimes ordered the termination of the condo governing structure of Heron Pond, allowing the sale process to proceed.\n",

        "content": "In 1966, Jerry Camarillo\u2019s parents moved from an apartment near St. Andrew\u2019s Catholic Church off of Raymond Avenue to a home in\nAltadena\n.\nOver the years, there were remodels, giving it an open feeling and plenty of space for gatherings at nearly 1,700 square feet. Two cousins and family friends also live in the area. All of those homes were destroyed in January\u2019s Eaton Fire.\n\u201cWhere my mom\u2019s home is, never in a million years did we think that [the fire] was going to reach that far,\u201d said Camarillo, a portrait photographer who lives in nearby Pasadena and was also forced to evacuate during the fire.\nIn the beginning, post-fire, the neighbors banded together. The plan was to use the same contractor to lower costs. As reality set in with individual needs and circumstances, owners splintered off to go their own ways. Most went the conventional route of rebuilding with lumber. Camarillo\u2019s mother was in the same boat.\n\u201cThen we saw the amount of money we were going to get from the [insurance] policy that my parents had,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\u201d\nInsurance would cover around 65 to 70 percent of the cost, equating to a roughly $200,000 shortfall, Camarillo estimated.\n\u201cEven with my [contractor] friend\u2019s discount, we were probably going to build a house, but there would be no furniture, no appliances, no fencing, no garden,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even if we had a house, it\u2019s not really functional.\u201d\nA local newscast caught Camarillo\u2019s attention. It featured a story on Hapi Homes, the maker of panels made from light gauge steel.\nNow, his mother is one of several homeowners in\nAltadena\nand\nPacific Palisades\nlooking to\nalternative homebuilding methods\nthat promise an affordable and faster path back into their residences.\nIn Camarillo\u2019s case, he was seeing Hapi Homes kit pricing quoted for $82 per square foot. At the time, quotes were no less than $500 per square foot to go the traditional route. He\u2019s now hearing of costs shooting up to $600 a foot.\nCamarillo\u2019s mother is ready to wrap up the design work soon. Building will take between six to eight weeks and he\u2019s hoping they can break ground as early as December.\nAlternative solutions\nHapi Homes is what\u2019s known as a maker of panelized homebuilding materials. Unlike modular homes that are assembled in a factory and then placed onto a lot, panelized homes are built with panels manufactured in a facility and then assembled on a home\u2019s site.\nFor the massive rebuild now underway in Altadena and\nPacific Palisades\n, the idea of\naffordable\nand fast construction using light gauge steel is appealing with companies such as Hapi Homes and RSG 3-D seeing business spike. There\u2019s also\nSamara\n, which is linked with Rick Caruso\u2019s Steadfast LA nonprofit to provide homes for free to low-income residents impacted by the wildfires.\nSometimes, it can be hard to break from tradition.\nCamarillo said he spread the word on Hapi Homes with his mother\u2019s neighbors and has posted about the company on the Nextdoor app in a bid to help the community get back to a sense of normalcy faster.\n\u201cI tried with them, but there\u2019s this innate skepticism about building with light gauge steel and the skepticism is lack of knowledge,\u201d he said.\nThe tides may be turning.\nMary O\u2019Brien, CEO and co-founder of Hapi Homes, said the number of inbound inquiries into the company has ticked up from Californians since February.\nThe company is currently in the design stage with 30 rebuild clients in Altadena and Pasadena. That\u2019s still a sliver of the 6,785 damaged and destroyed properties in the unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County destroyed by the Eaton Fire. As of Monday, 86 permits for single-family homes have been issued for that same area with 1,307 applications received, according to the county.\nThe majority of Hapi Homes customers are rebuilding in the 1,500- to 2,000-per-square-foot range. Several of them, like Camarillo, have visited the company\u2019s Salt Lake City, Utah factory to see the materials for themselves.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly are identical stories: People seeking us out because they\u2019re underinsured and they\u2019re looking for alternative ways to build aside from timber,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSeparately, they\u2019re looking at innovation to help them get them into their homes faster.\u201d\n\nHapi Homes\u2019 build kits range from $60 to $120 per square foot. When factoring in the price of a contractor \u2014 Hapi Homes currently has three working with several of its clients \u2014 the total is somewhere under $250 per square foot, according to O\u2019Brien.\nWhen a homeowner decides to move forward, they begin with the design stage, which typically takes about six weeks. The current holdup is in topography surveys, with one of the company\u2019s clients waiting around 12 weeks to get that done. It\u2019s performed by an outside service Hapi Homes doesn\u2019t provide but is critical for architects and engineers to move forward.\nWhen it comes to obtaining the actual permits, O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t concerned.\nShe pointed to one of the company\u2019s Los Angeles County clients not impacted by the fires, who received an accessory dwelling unit permit in two weeks at the end of March.\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s always going to be delays or unknowns, but we\u2019re comfortable with the fact that once we have the [permit] submission in, we\u2019re not necessarily anticipating problems,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the permitting is complete, we\u2019ll have the build kit on site in 30 days. Once you have control, it\u2019s not a long lifecycle to actually get into your house.\u201d\n\u201cRisk in every direction\u201d\nHapi Homes is set to open a Pasadena office this month, planting a project manager and quality control workers into an expanding market for its business.\nThe company isn\u2019t the only one seeing demand shoot up on account of the rebuilding.\nKen Calligar, founder and CEO of RSG 3-D, calls panelized housing an industry disruptor, but noted it\u2019s in the early adopter phase.\n\u201cPeople are not aware that there is such a thing as a resilient home because all they\u2019ve ever seen is a wood-framed home and so that\u2019s what we really work on is awareness and education,\u201d Calligar said.\nRSG is mainly a manufacturer of panels, although over the years it\u2019s built out its company-owned engineering and construction divisions. The company\u2019s pitch is housing that stands up to natural disasters and is sustainable by eliminating the waste and dumping fees associated with timber.\nDeep-seeded housing issues in the state, ranging from the impact on property from continuous wildfires and earthquakes to the shrinking of\ninsurance\navailability are now being placed under a microscope once again in areas such as Altadena and the Palisades.\nRSG said about two-thirds of new builds using its materials are from first timers to panelized housing, with about 75 percent of the business client led from word of mouth.\n\u201cPeople really understand the [homebuilding] challenges, especially in California now and of course in hurricane regions,\u201d Calligar said. \u201cThe state of California is a massive risk in every direction. It\u2019s just a giant geography of risk and it\u2019s not reducing.\u201d\nMost of RSG\u2019s rebuild clients are currently in the Palisades, with the remainder in Altadena, Malibu and Ventura County.\nIn total, there are 40 to 50 homeowners, who have architects and expect to use RSG 3-D, Calligar said. Of that total, between 20 to 30 are moving forward with permitting. RSG also has another 20 to 30 homeowners now ready to find an architect.\nThe first of the company\u2019s rebuild projects is slated to begin assembly in late September. Additional details could not be disclosed due to a non-disclosure agreement with the client, according to Calligar.\nAs with what O\u2019Brien of Hapi Homes noted, it\u2019s the financing that\u2019s the headache. Calligar said he has seen a funding shortfall \u201calmost universally\u201d among homeowners. He partially attributes that to flawed modeling on the part of\ninsurance\ncompanies when it comes to assessing risk that\u2019s now set off a chain reaction playing out in real time for the state\u2019s most closely watched construction sites in Altadena and the Palisades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an existential financial problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get insurance, you can\u2019t get a mortgage. If you can\u2019t afford insurance, you have to move.\u201d\nCalligar noted bigger problems not likely to be solved in the time it takes to rebuild the burned communities. For affected homeowners, they just want to go home.\nBack in Altadena, Camarillo\u2019s mother is 88. She\u2019s been lamenting she may never get back into her home. The opportunity to return faster than many of her neighbors offers a sense of relief after six months of loss and uncertainty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the human part of this. The emotional part, the brain fog, the trauma, the sleepless nights and just the panic,\u201d Camarillo said. \u201cWithin all of that you have to pick up the pieces of your life and try to navigate and make the best decisions for you personally. I don\u2019t wish, not even the evacuation part of this, on anyone.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Claire\u2019s Stores, the teen-focused fashion accessory retailer, has taken a step toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy after reportedly skipping rent payments for June and July at some leased locations.\nA Bloomberg\nreport\nciting sources familiar with the matter said the filing could come as soon as this week, but timing remains uncertain as the company makes its final preparations. The chain, founded in 1961, is headquartered in the Hoffman Estates suburb of Chicago.\nClaire\u2019s struggles and its impending second bankruptcy reflect a\nbroader downturn\namong chains once popular in malls and big box spaces within retail strip centers that has weighed on commercial real estate. Beyond major bankruptcies like those of Party City, Big Lots, Joann, and Rite Aid \u2014 which are forcing widespread store closures and contributing to vacant retail spaces \u2014 the commercial property market also faces challenges from tariffs and trade wars, causing merchants to hesitate on expanding their physical storefronts.\nTo start this year, net occupancy in the retail sector decreased by about 6 million square feet, marking the weakest quarter since the onset of the pandemic, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. This decline signals a retreat for retailers, with a two-year period of net expansion concluding last year as 1,300 more stores closed than opened, as reported by Coresight Research.\nClaire\u2019s has been exploring restructuring strategies, including a possible sale, amid deteriorating cash flow and a sizable debt load. Earlier this year, the company delayed interest payments in an effort to preserve cash. The retailer faces heightened financial pressure with a nearly $500 million loan maturing in December 2026 trading at just 37 cents on the dollar \u2014 down from 76 cents in June.\n\nThis would mark the retailer\u2019s second bankruptcy in a decade. A 2018 restructuring handed ownership to investment firms Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital.\nQuestions around U.S. tariff\u00a0 policy have further clouded Claire\u2019s future. The company and its key stakeholders declined to comment on the situation.\nClaire\u2019s was once a fixture in U.S. malls selling inexpensive jewelry and accessories to a teen and tween female clientele. The firm claims it has pierced more than 100 million ears during its 64-year existence. Last year Ryan Vero stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Interim CEO Chris Cramer.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

The Jackson Group acquired the building in 2015 for $21.8 million; the following year, the firm took out a loan from Citigroup guaranteed by the property for $12.7 million.\n\nWhen the Jackson Group was served a default notice last June for the property, it was $258,000 behind in payments on that loan. By the time the foreclosure auction rolled around, the total debt, penalties and fees associated with the debt was $14.4 million.\nBack in 2022, the Jackson Group lost the bottom two retail floors of the Grace Building after defaulting on a $28.5 million loan. It went into receivership shortly thereafter.\nThe Jackson Group originally bought the 12,907-square-foot property at the Grace Building in 2014 for $46 million. The first two floors fell 62 percent in value from an appraised estimate of $46 million in 2016 to $17.3 million in 2024, according to the Business Times. The only remaining retail tenant is Suit Supply after Jimmy Choo and La Perla left.\nThe Grace Building retail property is scheduled for foreclosure auction on Aug. 21.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jared Solomon, the former Vornado vice president\naccused of embezzling more than $9 million\nfrom the REIT, has decided to fight the charges.\nSolomon, alongside his attorney, Peter Toumbekis, pleaded not guilty on December 4 after prosecutors from the U.S. Southern District\u2019s office charged him with one count each of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\nIn May, prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle with Solomon to change his plea to guilty. But soon after, Solomon brought on a new legal team at Aidala, Bertuna &amp; Kamins, who said they needed more time to review his case.\nThe judge decided to extend the schedule for pretrial motions. After about three months, the Aidalia, Bertuna &amp; Kamins attorneys told the court last week there had been a \u201ccomplete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship\u201d and they would be resigning from the case.\n\u201cWe have reached the \u2018point of no return\u2019 in our representation of Mr. Solomon,\u201d attorney Arthur Aidala wrote. \u201cDespite our best efforts, the attorney-client relationship is beyond repair. Due to multiple significant communication-related issues, we do not believe we can provide an adequate defense for Mr. Solomon any longer.\u201d\nAidala additionally noted that Toumbekis had remained involved in the case, and on Monday, Toumbekis told the court that he plans to move to dismiss the charges on constitutional grounds on Sept. 29.\nToumbekis said that the government\u2019s indictment fails to provide clear and specific allegations that Solomon can defend himself against.\n\n\u201cHere, the indictment provides no detail whatsoever \u2014 no specific dates, acts, victims, misrepresentations, or transmissions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe lack of meaningful factual allegations renders the indictment impermissibly vague and invites arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Southern District U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\nThe government\u2019s indictment is light on details.\nIt accused Solomon of devising a scheme to defraud an unidentified \u201cVictim Company 1\u201d between 2009 and 2023, but didn\u2019t explain anything about how the scheme operated.\nA person familiar with the allegations, however, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it has to do with Vornado\u2019s Times Square signage business.\nIf found guilty, Solomon faces up to 20 years in prison and will have to pay the millions he allegedly stole. That allegedly includes a Westchester home at Three Beverly Road in Purchase, New York (which records show Solomon bought for $4.55 million in 2023), a co-op apartment at 23 East 74th Street ($3.95 million in 2020, per StreetEasy) as well as money in Solomon\u2019s bank account.\n",

The plan for the 217-unit property was filed with the New York City Department of Buildings.\nThe building would span 211,000 square feet, including nearly 11,000 square feet for a community facility. NYCHA recently filed plans to demolish the seven-story, 36-unit building at the site, which were approved.\nPlans to revamp the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses, which include the site in question, date back several years. A\nsurvey of NYCHA residents\nreported in 2023 found that more were in favor of tearing down and redeveloping the properties than simply rehabilitating them.\n\u201cThe redevelopment plan puts NYCHA residents first, creating a more equitable living experience for them in Chelsea, inclusive of the modern amenities and accessibility features that many of their neighbors are accustomed to,\u201d a NYCHA spokesperson said in a statement.\nRepresentatives for the developers did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\n\nIn 2019, tenants rejected a proposal to demolish at least two of the public housing buildings, opting instead to have the developers renovate. But the cost of those renovations skyrocketed in the intervening years, pushing a full rebuild as a practical option.\nThe developers, which also include Essence Development, are tasked with replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also construct retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments; 1,000 of those will be put aside at affordable rates.\nAs of 2023, the project was expected to cost $1.5 billion.\nNew York City\u2019s public housing authority has been under increased pressure to fill its empty units, which are\nmore plentiful\nthan previously believed. When including units being held for resident relocations within NYCHA, those that need substantial repairs and those being converted to community uses, the number of vacant units is greater than 8,600.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The house boasts a wine cellar and four stone fireplaces.\nSchools, space and airport access are big draws for the property, according to Hershenberg \u2014 not to mention its proximity to Vaquero Golf Course. The house is 13 miles from DFW International Airport and within Keller Independent School District.\n\nThis listing is part of an uptick in luxury offerings Hershenberg typically sees around this time of year as wealthy clients seek year-end tax advantages. The majority of closings come in the second half of the year, he said.\nPlus, \u201cPeople are trying to get settled before school starts,\u201d said Erwin Nicholas II, a Houston-based agent who specializes in luxury homes.\nIn addition, homes of this size in the Southlake-Westlake area are freeing up as empty-nesters move to properties that are easier to maintain, according to Hershenberg.\n\u201cThese owners purchase homes and move to something a little bit more turnkey. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to spend your retiree years maintaining a five-acre estate,\u201d Hershenberg said.\nMid-market buyers might be standing on the sidelines waiting for interest rates to fall, but that\u2019s not the case for the luxury sector where many buyers pay in cash.\nThe luxury market in North Texas is coming out on top. Last year\u2019s Compass luxury report reported the brokerage sold 13 homes for more than $10 million in Dallas-Fort Worth last year, compared with five in Houston and zero in Austin.\n",

        "content": "Developer Gary Melius has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a bid to save Oheka Castle from being sold.\nAccording to the bankruptcy filing, the property owes $63.5 million to creditors and has just $57.27 in a checking account,\nNewsday\nreported. Its assets total $92.8 million, including the property itself, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\nFiling for Chapter 11 will allow the politically connected Long Island developer some breathing room, providing a temporary stay on\nforeclosure\nproceedings that have plagued the property for almost a decade.\n\u201cI had a foreclosure; I was going to lose the place on Aug. 7. I\u2019ve been in foreclosure for 10 years, but the judge gave them permission to sell it, so I could no longer keep them at bay,\u201d Melius told Newsday, speaking about banks and lenders. The property was set to be sold at auction on Thursday.\nThe 109,000-square-foot chateau acts as a hotel, restaurant and wedding venue. Melius hopes to bring in more cash with plans to build a 95-unit, four-story\ncondominium\non castle grounds. His lawyer told Newsday that these concurrent ventures will allow him to pay back lenders.\n\nThe condominiums were the source of a 2023 lawsuit brought by the Cold Spring Country Club, which alleged the town board \u201cabused its authority\u201d after approving a permit Melius needed due to the chateau\u2019s location within Huntington\u2019s historic building overlay district.\nThe castle was built in 1921 for banker Otto Kahn and is the second-largest private residence ever constructed in the United States, according to the castle\u2019s website. Melius originally bought the property in 1984 and resides there himself.\nIn 1941, the castle was used as the set for Xanadu in the movie \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d appeared in the HBO show \u201cSuccession\u201d and was the site of the music video for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBlank Space.\u201d It\u2019s also been the venue for several celebrity weddings, including musician Kevin Jonas and disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner.\nMelius was shot in an apparent\nassassination attempt\noutside the castle in 2014. The case remains unsolved.\n\u2014\nQuinn Waller\n",

The property is proposed for a development with 350 condos and 180 hotel keys with ground-floor retail.\nLed by Philippe Zuber, Kerzner\u2019s brands include Atlantis Resorts, One&amp;Only, Siro resorts and Rare Finds. Its website does not list any U.S. hotels. The firm was founded in 1993 by late South African business tycoon Solomon \u2018Sol\u2019 Kerzner.\nAs of now, \u201cno project in Miami has been confirmed,\u201d a Kerzner representative said via email.\n\nKerzner \u201cis always exploring opportunities to grow its portfolio of ultra-luxury resorts,\u201d the representative said.\nSwire, led by Henry Bott, completed\nBrickell City Centre\n, which spans roughly five city blocks, in 2016. The project consists of about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; the 352-key East Hotel at Brickell City Centre; and a pair of office buildings.\nThe firm has been steadily divesting of the mixed-use complex, shedding two major sites this year. In June, Swire sold its 75 percent stake in the retail portion of Brickell City Centre and the underground parking garages to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n. Simon already owned a 25 percent stake in the properties.\nIn May, Swire sold a 2.8-acre development site, scrapping plans for an office supertall. Miami-based Melo Group, led by the Argentine Melo family, bought the property for\n$211.5 million\n.\nFunds tied to Trinity Fund Advisors and Certares Real Estate Management bought the East Hotel for\n$174 million\nin 2021. Northwood Investors paid\n$163 million\nfor the Two Brickell City Centre and Three Brickell City Centre office buildings in 2020.\nKerzner is at least the second Dubai-based real estate firm to home in on a prime South Florida development site. Damac Properties, led by Hussain Sajwani, bought the 1.8-acre oceanfront Surfside collapse site in 2022 for\n$120 million\n. Champlain Towers South had collapsed in 2021, killing 98 people.

        "content": "Downtown Chicago condo market sales continue to struggle with ever-decreasing value, as some properties are changing hands for substantially less than what they sold for more than 15 years ago.\nThe downtown slump is by all accounts an outlier to the rest of the Chicago-area\u2019s robust housing market. Local real estate agents point to a combination of a slow return to office work from the pandemic and an increase in downtown criminal activity, as reported by\nCrain\u2019s\n. The perception of downtown as a \u201cprime, luxurious market\u201d has dwindled, Coldwell Banker\u2019s Chezi Rafaeli told the outlet, as buyers look beyond Streeterville and the Loop to the West Loop, Lincoln Park and beyond.\nRecent sales recorded during the last few days showed losses in value in the millions, such as a three-bedroom condo in the tower at 900 North Michigan Avenue \u2014 called the Bloomington\u2019s tower \u2014 that sold for $2.62 million. In 2009, the sellers of the property paid $5 million for it, or nearly twice the recent sale price. A\ncondo in the St. Regis tower\n, at 363 East Wacker Drive, listed for $8 million last week, down $1.2 million from the seller\u2019s purchase price in 2022,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported.\nOther recent deals showed significant devaluation but not quite in the millions, such as a Millennium Park-area two-bedroom condo at 6 North Michigan Avenue that sold for $200,000 less than it fetched in 2011, as well as a Trump Tower unit listed for $810,000, the same price it traded for in 2011 and $33,000 less than it sold for in 2009.\nOther factors leading to the slump include a glut of inventory downtown added during the 2000s up until the housing crash. At that time, 20,000 condos were added downtown.\n\nThe flip side of the dropoff is that it presents an opportunity for downtown renters looking to buy or anyone considering a move downtown to invest now at the lower price points. There are also recent examples of similar condos sold for greater appreciation over their prior prices, such as a Westshore Drive condo near the St. Regis tower that sold for over 40 percent more than its original sale price in 2012.\nAgent Nick Powers of Baird &amp; Warner, who helped the downtown renters that purchased the aforementioned Millennium Park condo, said the discount his clients got on a two-bedroom unit isn\u2019t necessarily a warning sign for downtown living, but might instead represent a course-correction in the market.\n\u201cJust because it was overpriced 16 years ago doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s overpriced now,\u201d Powers told the outlet.\n\u2014 Eric Weilbacher\n",

The project, developed in partnership with the City of Dallas, is scheduled to open in June 2027.\nTravis Barber, development associate at Dallas-based Generation Housing, said the project aligns with the city\u2019s goal of repurposing underutilized land. It also supports the West Oak Cliff Area Plan, which promotes diverse and mixed-income housing.\n\u201cOne of the city\u2019s goals is to repurpose underused parking lots for more housing,\u201d Barber told the Dallas Morning News. \u201cThis is a great site for the City of Dallas to invest in. It\u2019s 6.5 acres currently occupied by a church and a lot of surface parking.\u201d\n\nLocal demand is already evident, with Dallas College officials noting struggles to find housing for\u00a0 students and staff.\nThe property had been under contract since 2023, with challenges that included rezoning, applying for 4 percent housing tax credits, securing bond reservations and forming a public-private partnership with the city. The rezoning approval, obtained last summer, was a particularly complex hurdle, according to Corbin Tanenbaum of Weitzman, who brokered the deal alongside colleague Scott Smith. The team also helped the church secure a new location in Carrollton, where a property is currently under contract.\nThe $70 million development of the church site is funded through $25 million in tax-exempt bonds, $33 million in low-income housing tax credit equity, and $7 million in city-issued gap financing.\nHiLine Illinois will offer 22 units for households earning up to 30 percent of the area median income, 20 units for 31 to 50 percent of AMI, 120 units for 51 to 60 percent of AMI, and 38 units for 61 to 70 percent of AMI. Dallas\u2019 current AMI for a family of four is $117,300.\nBeyond housing, the development will feature services and extra amenities, including free tax preparation, financial literacy programs, health and wellness courses and a 2,500-square-foot co-working space.",

Let\u2019s look at building on top of libraries. Let\u2019s look at abandoned school buildings,\u201d he said.\nHe also backed faster permitting and land use approvals, including changes to ULURP and deploying artificial intelligence to process drawings and approvals.\nOn NYCHA, Adams defended public-private partnerships, including the Related-led Elliott-Chelsea rebuild.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep putting a Band-Aid on a cancerous sort of repairs,\u201d he said.\nAdams also made his election pitch\nto the industry\nas he tries to fend off Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani for the city\u2019s top office.\n\u201cMy record has been clear,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe industry has benefited from my administration, and I am looking for them to acknowledge that benefit and give me the support I need so we can stop someone that\u2019s coming into the city that\u2019s going to be harmful, not only to the industry, but\u2026 his policy is going to be harmful to our city.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Republic Investment Company and Capstone Equities have acquired the Smyth hotel in Tribeca for $41 million.\nThe seller appears to be a joint venture involving Korman Communities, which\npurchased\nthe hotel in 2017 for $72.2 million. Korman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe building was developed and opened in 2009 by Walton Street Capital in a joint venture with Tribeca Associates. In 2010, the pair brought 15 condo units to market, called the Smyth Upstairs. The acquisition by Republic and Capstone does not include those residential units.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of high-quality hotels in Tribeca and the few new openings have really been incredibly successful,\u201d said Joshua Zamir, founding partner of Capstone Equities. \u201cThis location being in southern Tribeca also benefits from demand related to World Financial Center and the Financial District.\u201d\nThe investors plan to renovate the property to bring it upmarket, but Zamir said it\u2019s too early to say how much that renovation will cost or what exactly it will involve. It\u2019s the pair\u2019s seventh hotel acquisition, following deals for The Renwick, Ink48 and Life Hotel. Rebel Hotel Company will operate the property.\n\nThe Smyth\u2019s cultural cache shot up in 2012 after Kim and Kourtney Kardashian stayed in the development while they shot the first season of E! Network\u2019s \u201cKim and Kourtney Take New York.\u201d\nThe 100-room hotel contains about 7,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor event space. The building, including the condos, is 13 stories high, according to tax records. The total area of the building is more than 71,000 square feet.\nRepublic and Capstone aren\u2019t the only investors eyeing Tribeca.\nBroad Street Development and partner TPG Angelo Gordon are seeking to\nconvert a 10-story storage facility\nat 139 Franklin Street into up to 18 upscale condo units. The pair acquired the building for about $44 million and total capitalization will cost about $100 million.\nIn March, Urban Capital Group and Prosper Property Group announced\nplans\nto turn 32 and 34 Walker Street, in part a former textile warehouse, into five full-floor loft condos and ground-floor retail.\n",

        "content": "Brooklyn deals dominated the top real estate sales recorded in New York City on Tuesday, Aug. 5. Overall, there were 238 deals, totaling about $426 million, throughout the city.\n\ud83c\udfc6Residential:\nThe top residential sale recorded in New York City was for a resale at Extell Development Company\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row tower,\n157 West 57th Street\n. The 66th-floor condominium transferred from one LLC to another for $24 million, about $25 million more than the unit\u2019s last trade price in 2021. The true parties in the deal are hidden. The unit spans about 4,200 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $5,700 per square foot.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was in South Williamsburg.\nSimon Dushinksy\n\u2019s\nRabsky Group\noffloaded The Garnett, a mixed-use property at\n146 South Fourth Street,\nfor $82.5 million. The buyer was\nPacific Urban Investors\n, who financed the deal with a $41.2 million loan from\nNewmark\n. The Garnett, built in 2013, stands 11 stories tall and has 113 apartments.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn North Williamsburg, another apartment complex at\n56 North Ninth Street\ntraded hands for $66.3 million. The seller was Brooklyn-based developer\nDouble U Realty\nand the buyer was Boston-headquartered\nRockpoint Group\n, Dallas-based\nLincoln Property Company\nand\nLand Labor Capital\n. The property dates to 2019 and has 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nTruist Bank\nprovided a $44.8 million mortgage for the deal.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nA company managed by\nDavid Fu\noffloaded a five-story, mixed-use property with five apartments at\n385 Broome Street\nin Little Italy. The buyer, a company tied to\nDaniel Hedaya\nand\nMaxwell Seibald\u2019s DAX Real Estate\n, paid $10.9 million for the building, financing the purchase with an $8 million mortgage from\nInternational Finance Bank.\nThe Fu-related entity acquired the property two decades ago for $3.1 million.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Marco and Helga Locascio\n, via a trust, parted with a brownstone at\n45 Park Place\nin Park Slope for $6.5 million, its asking price, according to Compass. The buyers were\nNicole and Andrew Bocskocsky\n, who are both entrepreneurs. Marco Locascio is an executive at Orogen Royalties, a royalty and mineral exploration company. The townhouse, constructed around the turn of the 20th century, last sold in 2016 for $3.7 million. It went on the market in May with Compass\u2019\nAdam Sadel\nand\nJoshua Golan\n.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Peter Mudd\nsold a townhouse at\n527 Ninth Street\n, also in Park Slope, for $4.4 million. Mudd had owned the property since 2011, when he purchased it for $1.7 million. The buyer in the latest deal was an LLC. The three-story home has five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms and a fireplace. Corcoran\u2019s\nJessica Buchman\nwas the lead listing agent on the deal.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nIndustrial vacancy rising as tariffs, recession fears loom\nThe vacancy rate for industrial buildings across the country is up \u2014 and more properties are slated to hit the market soon, even as President Trump\u2019s newly enacted tariffs raise questions about the U.S. economy.\nThe national industrial vacancy rate in June came in at 9 percent, a 290-basis-point increase, year over year, and a 50-basis-point rise compared to May, according to a new report from CommercialCafe, Yardi\u2019s commercial real estate listings platform.\nThe pipeline also has no shortage of square footage. So far this year, about 147 million square feet have been constructed. Another 342 million square feet is underway \u2014 near pre-pandemic levels. When these properties hit the market, the industrial stock in the U.S. will increase by 1.7 percent.\nThe spike in vacancies reverses what the industry saw during and immediately after the pandemic: Consumers, stuck at home, bought more goods online than ever, which boosted already high demand for warehouse space. This led developers to build pre-leased spec properties. Now, economic uncertainty is causing some industrial tenants to think twice about their supply chains, according to the report.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Which is more powerful, the laws of rent stabilization or the laws of economics?\nMy Monday\ncolumn\nwas about a two-bedroom, prime West Village apartment with a stabilized rent of about $1,400 that sits vacant because it needs a $100,000 overhaul. I mentioned it in conversation with someone, to which she declared: \u201cI\u2019d pay $100,000 to get that lease.\u201d\nThink of the real-world value of a permanently renewable, low-rent lease for a renovated, 1,200-square-foot, prime Village unit that you can eventually bequeath to a roommate, such as your kid. It\u2019s in the millions.\nSo paying a hundred grand to renovate is perfectly logical for a tenant. But not legal. Or is it?\nI asked some landlords and lawyers. Here\u2019s what I learned.\nTechnically, a landlord cannot require a prospective tenant to pay for renovations in exchange for a lease. And technically, the owner must provide a code-compliant dwelling at lease-signing.\nBut if there\u2019s a high degree of trust between the landlord and tenant, wink-and-nod arrangements involving rent-stabilized leases and renovations can and do happen.\n\u201cI have a friend who has renovated rent-stabilized apartments for his kids for apartments in the West Village and Gramercy Park,\u201d one owner told me. The friend has \u201can in\u201d with the owner of those buildings, one of the city\u2019s most prominent landlords. Clearly, the two have reached some kind of understanding.\n\u201cI do the same when I can in my buildings,\u201d the owner added, referring to properties in Prospect Park South, Flatbush and Crown Heights. \u201cBut when low-rent apartments come up, they sit vacant until we find a brother or cousin of the super/porter where we can rent the apartment as is. Most of the time, they fix it up. Occasionally, they live in squalor.\u201d\nTrust is necessary because the tenant could, in theory, report the squalid conditions to the government and compel the landlord to renovate. The owner might never collect enough rent to justify the outlay and operating burden.\n\u201cI would rather invest in treasuries at 5% than get an 8% return in rent-stabilized housing,\u201d a Harlem owner of such housing\ntweeted\n. \u201cWith treasuries, I eliminate the risk of socialism and I eliminate work hours. I just buy and sit. Who wants to do all of the work associated with rent control for 3% extra?\u201d\nThe first landlord was equally blunt. \u201cI would never put any money into a low-rent apartment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe losers are the 25- to 40-year-olds who can\u2019t afford a $5,000 market-rent apartment and can\u2019t afford doing their own renovation.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole market for fixed-up, rent-stabilized apartments is dead,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe whole system is just so stupid.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe City Council considered downscaling the floor-area ratio in a Garment District portion of the Midtown South rezoning to ensure that demolish-and-rebuild projects would not pencil out. The point would be to save the manufacturing tenants in those buildings. Wouldn\u2019t that be like scratching up your new car so no one steals it? Word is the Council will reject the Garment District carveout when it votes on the broader plan Wednesday. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Riverbank, a Midtown rental tower that\nJPMorgan just bought\nfor nearly $250 million, was the site of the\n\u201cClub Kids\u201d murder\n, later documented in the film \u201cParty Monster\u201d starring Macauley Culkin as\nthe killer\n. (It was called Riverbank West at the time.) Thank you to\nTRD\n\u2019s Alexis Manrodt for spotting this on social media.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Surveillance technology can identify someone by the way they walk, but Council member Jennifer Guti\u00e9rrez has introduced a bill that would classify a person\u2019s gait as personal identifying and private information, Gothamist\nreported\n. The classification would create oversight into the way that the information, as well as data about phone or computer use, is used and distributed. \u201cRight now, the city can collect and share information about how you walk, type or browse \u2014 without treating it as sensitive. That needs to change,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez.\n\u2014 The City Council will likely not hold a vote to override Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nveto\nthat kept Bally\u2019s proposed casino in the running for a state gaming license, City &amp; State\nreported\n. Some Council members, including Bob Holden, aren\u2019t thrilled with the Council\u2019s decision to stand down, claiming it doesn\u2019t honor Council member\nKristy Marmorato\u2019s opposition\nto the casino bid. \u201cMember deference is the only real power we have,\u201d Holden said.\n\u2014 A 2.7 magnitude earthquake hit New Jersey\u2019s Bergen County on Tuesday, three days after a 3.0 magnitude quake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, according to\nCBS News\n. No damage was reported.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$6.5 million\nfor a 3,628-square-foot, single-family house at 45 Park Place in Park Slope. The Golan Team at Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$10.9 million\nfor an 11,775-square-foot, mixed-use property at 385 Broome Street in Little Italy. Dax Real Estate purchased the seven-unit building from Hermes Management LLC.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$5.7 million\nfor a 2,461-square-foot condominium unit at 250 West 96th Street on the Upper West Side. Pamela D\u2019Arc, Robert Khederian and Jackie Gill of Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for 38-11 32nd Street, 38-10 33rd Street and 32-08 38th Avenue in Long Island City. Combined, the three permits call for 253 new units and 241,908 square feet. Joseph Frankl filed them on behalf of Steven Hurwitz of Cavu Property Group.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

The new location, slated to open in mid-2026, will span four floors \u2014 the 2nd, and the 4th through 6th \u2014 of the 24-story office building, the company announced.\nThe deal comes as WeWork embarks on a broader effort to streamline operations and double down on high-demand areas under CEO John Santora. Foot traffic at WeWork\u2019s NoMad locations (of which there are three) is up nearly 11 percent from January to June, the company said.

        "content": "In 1998, a city inspector walked into 109 East Ninth Street and found a gas meter and piping in a public entrance \u2014 a violation deemed hazardous by the Department of Buildings. Then the agency found an illegally installed kitchen and bathroom on the third floor.\nMore than two decades would pass before anything came of the violations at the five-story, 1860s-era single-room occupancy. But when they resurfaced, a seemingly manageable problem mushroomed into a horrific mess.\nThe story that unfolded at 109 East Ninth Street hits all the low notes of multifamily ownership in New York City: aging buildings, intractable bureaucracy, kneejerk politicians, militant activists, conniving tenants, pointless laws, housing court, administrative trials and lawsuits.\nMost of these could have been avoided had everyone sat down with the building\u2019s owner, Michael Geylik. He is not hard to find: His office is on the ground floor.\nInherited violations\nGeylik bought the 13-unit but mostly vacant SRO for $3.35 million in 2021. With permits from the Department of Buildings, he converted the former pub on the ground floor and removed the longstanding violations: the illegal partitions, kitchen, shower and toilets that tenants shared on the third floor, and a hazardous gas riser.\nThat work, approved by the city in late 2022, cured the violations from the 1990s, but Geylik still needed to replace the communal kitchen and bathroom.\nTo do that, he needed a Certificate of No Harassment. The City Council had added that layer of regulation in 2018, back when landlords had a financial incentive to vacate rent-stabilized units and sometimes used construction to harass tenants into leaving.\nThe state\u2019s rent law reform of 2019 removed the incentive, but the Council kept the anti-harassment law on the books, and in fact expanded it in 2021. Geylik applied for the certificate, known by the acronym CONH, in August 2023.\nThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development looked back six years to see if Geylik was an unscrupulous landlord. More than six months later, HPD found he was not. It granted the CONH in March 2024.\nIn April, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake shook the city. Most buildings suffered no damage, but 109 East Ninth Street was already in bad shape \u2014 far worse than Geylik realized when he bought it.\nVisible structural damage, previously flagged by a tenant named Judy Sabin, now appeared worse than before. Walls were cracking and the top four floors were severely sloped. Walking up the stairs made people nervous.\nGeylik hired Steel Core Engineering to do an analysis. Renovations were suspended pending the results \u2014 disappointing tenants who were expecting a new communal kitchen and bathroom. Their complaints would come back to haunt the landlord.\nBut the structural integrity of the building had to be addressed first.\nDepartment of Buildings engineer Philip Ng was so alarmed by Steel Core\u2019s findings that he demanded immediate exploratory openings in the walls to determine if 109 East Ninth Street was sound.\nThe next month, August 2024, DOB issued two emergency work orders. One required a full structural evaluation and corrective plan. The other demanded temporary shoring from the cellar through the second floor, which Geylik put in immediately.\nThe columns made it hard to move around his office but helped support the slanted stairwell. But much more work was needed, especially for the SRO portion of the building.\nSteel Core opened some walls and ceilings of vacant units and discovered more frightening problems. Load-bearing exterior walls had huge gaps in between the bricks, some of which could be moved by hand. Severely deteriorated masonry walls were transferring their load onto compromised mortar joints.\nMany joists had extreme water damage, and some floor joists were unsupported except by the subfloor. They were sending their load onto overloaded joists.\nThe upper floors were sagging toward the middle of the building and could collapse at any time, Steel Core told DOB in a 45-page report. The engineering firm judged them unsafe for occupancy.\nHere come the tenants\nGeylik was advised that the structural repairs would be difficult or impossible with tenants in place. Tenants likely realized that as well, and they did not want to move from units that rent for as little as\n$155 a month\n. Their housing is less expensive than a storage locker and exceedingly rare, as the city\u2019s few remaining SROs are grandfathered under ancient building codes.\nThe renters began to turn up the pressure on the landlord.\nIn November, one complained about the work Geylik was doing to comply with the emergency orders. The Department of Buildings issued a violation.\nThe agency withdrew it two weeks later, on Dec. 6, writing, \u201cAfter further review, we have determined that a permit covering the work was approved before the violation was issued.\u201d\nBut the initial action fed a narrative that Geylik was harassing tenants with unauthorized construction.\nMeanwhile, other building drama was playing out.\nA fourth-floor renter filed a detailed complaint alleging that across the hall in 4B, fellow tenant James Hicks was renting out his room through a middleman named Bobby Rich. State law requires rent-stabilized units to be a primaryv home.\n\u201cThe purported tenant, James Hicks, has not used his rent stabilized room as a primary residence or lived here for over 25 years,\u201d the neighbor wrote in December. \u201cHe has been subletting the room to various people to generate passive income for himself. I myself once sublet it from him over 10 years ago and I have receipts to prove it.\u201d\nThe complaint went on to say that a man named Tom Scarlet had rented 4B from Hicks for several years and had acknowledged paying $500 a month \u2014 about three times the legal rent, now $177.\nRecently, strangers had been using the unit for shorter periods, and given the building\u2019s poor condition and shared bathrooms, the resident across the hall was worried. Once, he called the police to report an unauthorized visitor.\n\nDocumenting illegal short-term rentals is difficult. The city\u2019s Special Operations Unit tried, visiting the building twice. The first time it could not get in. The second time it gained access but did not find a short-term renter. It closed the case in January.\nGeylik was incredulous. The owner had encountered a man in the building late last year and asked who he was. \u201cI am your tenant, James Hicks,\u201d the man said.\n\u201cI have never seen you,\u201d replied the landlord, whose surveillance system captures movement in and out of the building.\n\u201cEvery time I enter,\u201d Hicks said, \u201cI put on invisibility clothes.\u201d\nThe Harry Potter reference did not amuse Geylik, who said he recorded the conversation on his phone. \u201cJames, you haven\u2019t been residing in the building,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou have to live here.\u201d\n\u201cTake me to court,\u201d Hicks shot back.\nGeylik did.\nBut housing court in New York City is a notorious slog. Evictions can take a year or more. The case against Hicks, who Geylik believes lives in Washington, D.C., is still pending.\nAnother of Geylik\u2019s four tenants \u2014 the other units are vacant \u2014 is a CUNY photography lecturer named Patterson Beckwith. He has rented the room since he was a Cooper Union student.\nGeylik is trying to get him out as well, alleging that Beckwith no longer lives there and only uses it for storage and a mail drop. At $214 a month, it\u2019s $36 cheaper than a\n24-square-foot, East Village locker\nthat holds \u201csmall items like clothes, seasonal decorations, and a few boxes.\u201d\nGeylik hired a private investigator who gathered evidence that the professor was living with his wife in her rent-stabilized Greenpoint apartment and their\nsecond home\nin Pittsburgh, where deeds show they own three houses in a row. Geylik\u2019s cameras at 109 East Ninth Street showed the academic spent just 1 percent of his time at his 90-square-foot SRO.\nIn court, Beckwith, reportedly on the verge of tears, told a judge that the landlord brought the case to harass him. Geylik was infuriated. \u201cWhat bothers me the most,\u201d the owner said, \u201cis that he knows he doesn\u2019t reside there.\u201d\nBeckwith did not return emails seeking comment.\nGeylik took two other tenants to court for not paying rent for 18 months and two years, respectively, but the city paid the arrears through its \u201cone-shot\u201d program and the cases were dropped.\nThe tenants have brought their own housing court case against Geylik, alleging harassment.\nRepairs stymied\nIn February 2025, Geylik filed plans for $75,000 worth of work to support the roof with temporary shoring and replace the rotted framing on the upper floors with steel, paying $1,130 in filing fees for the privilege. The work would cure a violation issued by the Department of Buildings.\nWhile tenants in other buildings beg their landlords for repairs, at Geylik\u2019s property, they tried to stop him. Cooper Square, an affiliate of TakeRoot Justice, advocated for them. The landlord sensed that the group had political connections that he lacked, so he hired a government relations lawyer, former City Council member Ken Fisher.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not always wrong,\u201d Fisher said of Cooper Square, \u201cbut they\u2019re very aggressive and everyone gets painted with the same brush.\u201d\nEven before the landlord hauled them into housing court, tenants were upset that a year after HPD issued a certificate of no harassment, he still had not put in the third-floor kitchen and bathroom. They also reported heat outages, although Geylik had replaced the boiler.\nSome claimed the exploratory probing ordered by the Department of Buildings was a ruse to create dust and noise. The eviction filings amounted to harassment as well, the tenants charged.\nGeylik also refused to accept some rent checks \u2014 a standard practice when a landlord does not want to validate a disputed tenancy.\nPreviously, the city had worked with Geylik to make the building safe and habitable. But, prompted by tenant advocacy groups and local politicians, agencies began to descend on 109 East Ninth Street like a swarm of wasps.\nOne 311 call triggered a March 13 inspection that found minor violations, including missing firestopping and exposed wiring in unoccupied rooms, which Geylick quickly corrected. Days after that visit, HPD showed up with six building inspectors. An inspector returned that afternoon and issued a violation for the same infraction cited on March 13 \u2014 part of a pattern, Geylick says, of \u201cduplicate complaints on resolved technical issues.\u201d\nIt seemed to him like a mission to revoke the certificate of no harassment, which a Department of Buildings spokesperson told\nTRD\nwas needed for the upper-floor repairs job filed in February.\nCooper Square was joined in its effort by five politicians, including state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, the powerful Senate Housing Committee chair, and Council member Carlina Rivera. Without asking Geylik for his side of the story, they urged HPD in a March 25 letter to \u201ctake all necessary steps to remedy the egregious conditions in this building, including reevaluating the CONH.\u201d\n\u201cTenants were describing a lot of activity that sounded problematic,\u201d Kavanagh said in a phone interview. \u201cSo we thought it was reasonable to ask HPD to look at the conditions to make sure it was not uninhabitable.\u201d\nAgencies tend to escalate cases when asked by elected officials. On April 22, HPD suspended the certificate of no harassment, and for the past three months has been in the city\u2019s administrative court trying to revoke it. Between that and the five housing court cases, Geylik has run up large legal fees. In May alone, they were $60,000.\nHPD insists that Geylik can find a way to shore up the building without a CONH, perhaps by changing the scope of work. But the Department of Buildings makes the call.\nKavanagh told\nTRD\nthat his office could help Geylik deal with the bureaucracy if asked. \u201cOur goal is to get tenants decent conditions to live in,\u201d the senator said, \u201cnot to make life miserable for landlords.\u201d\nBut until his non-harasser status is restored by HPD, Geylik said, his hands are tied.\n\u201cOn one side, I\u2019m being pushed by DOB to fix the building,\u201d Geylik said. \u201cOn the other side, HPD won\u2019t let me.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Hudson Pacific Properties\u2019 losses deepened in the second quarter.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust\nreported\na loss of $83 million compared to a roughly $75 million loss the\nprior quarter\nand a $47 million loss a year earlier, attributing the results to decreased revenue, ample lease terminations and increased disposal of obsolete assets, in its second-quarter earnings release.\nRevenues declined to $190 million compared to $218 million year-over-year due to declining office occupancies and discounted asset sales. That included a San Francisco office building the company\nsold\nearlier this summer for $28 million, about half the $56.5 million Hudson Pacific purchased it for a decade ago.\nHudson Pacific is still feeling the burn of flailing office and studio sectors that are dealing with soaring vacancies and a production\nslowdown\n, respectively.\nThe company\u2019s office revenues fell to $156 million in the three months ending June 30, compared to $176 million during the same period last year. Production studio revenues fared worse too, dipping to $34 million from $42 million year-over-year.\n\nHudson Pacific chair and CEO Victor Coleman, whose total compensation was valued at about $25 million last year despite ballooning losses, hinted at offloading more properties in the future, during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday, and touted a bright spot: leasing.\nHudson Pacific executed 558,000 square feet in leases in the second quarter, a small increase from a year earlier but a decline from the previous quarter. Still, second-quarter leases included a six-year, 77,000-square-foot renewal with a cybersecurity company at Metro Center in Foster City; a nine-year, 41,000-square-foot renewal with a digital sports company at 11601 Wilshire in Los Angeles; and a six-year, 32,000-square-foot new lease with a bio-tech company at Page Mill Hill in Palo Alto.\nColeman said during the call the firm is banking on artificial intelligence for an office recovery and looking to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s recent doubling of the film and television\ntax credit\nprogram for a production revival.\n",

        "content": "Danish architect\nBjarke Ingels\nis set to leave his mark on Los Angeles\u2019 Arts District.\nThe Los Angeles City Council has given the green light for a mixed-use high-rise development at 670 Mesquit Street,\nUrbanize Los Angeles\nreported. The project has been in the works for nearly a decade and will rise next to the Los Angeles River between the Sixth and Seventh Street Viaducts.\nThe development would consist of four interconnected high-rise buildings, the tallest of which would be 34 stories. Among the amenities would be a deck above the nearby railroad to the east \u2014 possibly the site of a future Arts District Metro station \u2014 to get residents closer to the river.\nDeveloper Vella Group, with designs from architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, plans to build 676,000 square feet of offices; 894 residential units, including 144 for very low- and extremely low-income households; a 271-room hotel; a charter elementary school; and commercial spaces for retail, restaurant and art galleries. In Los Angeles County, very low-income is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual salary of $51,000 for one person, while extremely low-income caps out at $31,850.\n\nThe 670 Mesquit project would replace the Rancho Cold Storage facility owned for years by the Gallo family.\u00a0 Construction is expected to take place either over a single five-year period or in separate phases over the course of nine years. A groundbreaking date has not yet been announced. Total cost of the project is estimated at $1.4 billion, according to\nThe Los Angeles Times\n.\nWhile the project was initially proposed as an office-heavy development, the plans have since shifted to focus more on housing. When completed, it will be one of the largest residential projects to be built in Downtown Los Angeles, per the L.A. Times. The shift comes as the office vacancy rate in Los Angeles ticked up last quarter and demand for office space continues to recover post-pandemic, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s second-quarter\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An apartment complex in Sunnyvale has traded hands in a nearly $70 million deal.\nSan Francisco-based Prime Finance bought the Citra apartments at 745 South Bernardo Avenue for $68.5 million, the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\nreported. An affiliate of Corebridge Real Estate Investors sold the property at a $40 million profit after buying it in 2014 for approximately $27 million.\nThe 5-acre property was built in 1968 and remodeled in 2009. It comprises 147 residential units, according to the Business Journal.\nThe Citra apartments\u2019 sales price was higher than the average multifamily sales price in Santa Clara County. The complex sold with a per-unit cost of about $466,000; the five-year average for Santa Clara County is about $458,000 for properties with more than 100 units, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Journal.\nThat being said, average rent prices in Sunnyvale are lower than those in neighboring Silicon Valley cities like Mountain View, Cupertino and\nSanta Clara\n. Average monthly rent prices in Sunnyvale were about $2,125, per the Business Journal.\n\nBesides residential sales like those, Sunnyvale is proving to be a magnet for tech companies seeking office space in Silicon Valley.\nApple, for example, has plunked down nearly $1 billion for various office properties in the area. In June, the iPhone maker spent $350 million for the office buildings at 615 and\n625 North Mathilda Avenue\nin Sunnyvale; last month, it snapped up the properties next door at 505-599 North Mathilda Avenue and\n605 West Maude Avenue\nfor\n$365 million\n.\nSemiconductor manufacturer Applied Materials has been on a similar tear in Sunnyvale over the past decade. Last month, it\npaid $25.1 million\nfor an office and research building at 999 East Arques Avenue. That acquisition followed nearly $422 million in building purchases in the South Bay city since 2018, including 928 East Arques Avenue for $41.4 million; 1050-1090 East Arques Avenue for more than $100 million; and two buildings last year at 929-935 East Arques Avenue and 306-310 De Guigne Road for $32.7 million. Last October, the company\ndropped $100 million\nfor a vacant Fry\u2019s Electronics store at 1077 East Arques Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz and his wife, Claudia, took out a $68.5 million mortgage on their oceanfront Palm Beach estate known as Montsorrel.\nRecords show the couple secured the financing from Bank of America, which has provided the couple with several loans tied to their compound at 542 and 548 North County Road over their decades of ownership. Most recently, the Peltzes took out a $40 million loan on the property in 2022, records show.\nThe Peltzes made headlines in 2022 when they hosted their daughter\nNicola\u2019s black tie wedding to Brooklyn Beckham\n, son of\nDavid and Victoria\n, at Montsorrel.\nNelson Peltz has a net worth of $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. He is best known as an activist investor and the head of Trian Fund Management. In 2021, the firm bought an office building in Palm Beach for\n$23 million\n. Last year he stepped down as the chair of Wendy\u2019s, which he had helmed for 17 years, according to published reports.\n\nThe loan comes decades after the billionaire couple bought the estate. Records show they bought the 25,300-square-foot mansion at 548 North County Road for $13.5 million in 1987. It has five bedrooms and 16 bathrooms, according to property records. It was built in 1965 by Anita Young, the widow of railroad magnate Robert R. Young and sister to artist Georgia O\u2019Keefe. Young dubbed the compound \u201cMontsorrel,\u201d meaning \u201cmountain of sorrows,\u201d according to published reports.\nIn 1988, an entity linked to the Peltzes bought the property across the street at 542 North County Road for $3 million, according to property records. They completed the 15,400-square-foot mansion in 1991, records show. Their compound totals 13.1 acres with two pools and two sport courts.\nPalm Beach\nproperty values have grown exponentially since the Peltzes bought their estate. Palm Beach County estimates the market value of the property at $372.4 million, which is likely a conservative approximation.\nThey\u2019re not the only billionaire couple tacking on a mortgage to their trophy estate. Last month, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z took out a $57.8 million mortgage on their mansion in Bel Air, California, bringing their\ntotal amount borrowed on the home to $110.6 million\n. With a combined net worth of more than $3 billion, they are considered music\u2019s richest couple.",

        "content": "A winery in Santa Clara County is poised to be transformed into a cemetery.\nMichael and Kellie Ballard have sold the Savannah-Chanelle Vineyards property outside Saratoga to the Saratoga Cemetery District for $20 million,\nThe Mercury News\nreported. In April, the district\npurchased\na house next to the 12.5-acre Madronia Cemetery for $4.5 million, pointing to a forthcoming expansion.\nThe Savannah-Chanelle property at 23600 Congress Springs Road was once listed for $27.5 million, per The Mercury News. The property spans five parcels and 57.9 acres.\nThe cemetery district has been eyeing an expansion in the area, according to the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\n.\n\u201cThis is the one we\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Steve Albright, general manager of Madronia Cemetery, told the Business Journal about the vineyard purchase. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this one for about a year.\u201d\n\nAbout 80 percent of the money spent on the vineyard came from debt, according to Albright. The\nSaratoga\nCemetery District will pay off the debt over the next 20 years as it prepares to turn the Savannah-Chanelle land into another cemetery for Saratoga residents.\nIn the meantime, the Cemetery District is leasing the property to Savannah-Chanelle, meaning the winery will continue to operate there for at least the next 10 years before the cemetery redevelops the land. In the lead-up to that change, the Cemetery District will work to rezone the property.\nLast year, the Ballards\nsued\nSanta Clara County after being fined more than $120,000 for allowing their vineyard manager and his family to live on the property in a recreational vehicle for more than a decade. The lawsuit is ongoing, according to the\nEast Bay Times\n.\nThe couple bought the winery in 1996\nfrom Victor Erickson\nand renamed it Savannah-Chanelle Vineyards after their two daughters. The property\u2019s history dates back more than a century when brothers Pierre and Eloi Pourroy planted vineyards at the site in 1901. In 1923, the brothers completed construction of a villa that is still standing today and is used by the Ballards as a vacation home.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Valencia Hotel Group scored refinancing for its River Walk hotel in San Antonio.\nThe Houston-based firm secured a $22.6 million loan for Hotel Valencia Riverwalk, at 150 East Houston Street, according to a release from Sonnenblick-Eichner Company, which arranged the deal.\nIt\u2019s a five-year, fixed-rate loan that will finance a maturing 10-year loan on the property, said Patrick Brown, a principal at Sonnenblick-Eichner. The debt amounts to $106,100 per key.\nBrown said the debt markets are \u201cextremely liquid\u201d for hotel loans, and the transaction generated a lot of interest.\nWhen Valencia developed the 213-key hotel in 2003, it was considered the city\u2019s first boutique hotel. The firm developed it on a site leased by former owner Maryland-based Federal Realty Investment Trust.\n\nValencia completed a $10 million upgrade at the property in 2017. The property features almost 10,000 square feet of meeting space, a gym, interior courtyard and three food and beverage options: Dorrego\u2019s, Naranja Tequila and Mezcal Bar, and Caf\u00e9 Naranja.\nHotel Valencia Riverwalk is part of San Antonio\u2019s most popular tourist attraction, the River Walk, which is a public park that hugs the San Antonio River and is lined with stores and restaurants. It\u2019s also within walking distance of the city\u2019s convention center.\nDespite the availability of fresh financing for hotels, San Antonio\u2019s downtown hospitality market is still struggling to stabilize after the pandemic.\nThe submarket sold 745,000 room nights in the first quarter, a drop of 15.4 percent from the first quarter of 2019, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n, citing consulting firm Source Strategies.\nValencia\u2019s other Texas properties are in Austin, Dallas, Lubbock and College Station. Its portfolio also includes a hotel in San Jose, California. It has two additional hotels in the pipeline: one in Tuscon, Arizona, and another in Arlington, Texas.\n",

The loan, carrying a 6.1 percent interest rate, will pay off roughly $1.1 billion in existing debt and fund nearly $40 million in reserves and closing costs, according to an S&amp;P Global presale report.\nThe CMBS transaction includes a $719 million \u201cA\u201d note that earned a preliminary AAA rating from S&amp;P on the back of Durst\u2019s financial strength and the tower\u2019s performance. Remaining capital will go toward tenant improvements, leasing costs and a $146 million equity payout to the landlord. The deal is expected to close Aug. 19.\nGreen Street\u2019s Commercial Mortgage Alert first revealed the CMBS deal. Durst previously\nlanded a $900 million refinancing\nfrom JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in 2019.\nDurst\u2019s Times Square tower, formerly known as 4 Times Square, is 92 percent leased. Its anchor tenant is social media app TikTok, which occupies 232,000 square feet through 2031. But the political cloud hanging over the Chinese-owned platform prompted lenders to earmark $50 million of the loan into a reserve fund in case TikTok\u2019s lease is disrupted by a U.S. ban.\n\nDurst acquired a ground lease on the property from the city and has an option to purchase it in 2027. The building was valued at $2.3 billion for the purposes of the refi.\nRents at the building average $116 per square foot. Tenants include Nasdaq,\nVenable\nand BMO Capital Markets, and the tower features H&amp;M\u2019s U.S. flagship store and prominent LED signage facing Broadway.\nThe refinancing comes as CMBS lending for New York\u2019s top-tier office properties heats up after years of drought. More than $59 billion in CMBS loans were issued nationwide in the first half of 2025 \u2014 the strongest showing since before the financial crisis, per Trepp \u2014 and other landlords including RFR, Tishman Speyer and Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge have recently inked billion-dollar-plus refinancings on Manhattan assets.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Midtown South rezoning is moving forward, but with a few changes that shave 165 apartments off the number of housing units to be built in the neighborhood.\nThe City Council\u2019s Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises voted on Wednesday to advance the rezoning of 42 blocks in Midtown South, but reduced the residential density allowed in certain parts of the neighborhood. With the changes, the rezoning is expected to net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 affordable. That\u2019s down from the 9,700 units, of which 2,890 would be affordable, originally projected.\nThe rezoning now heads back to the City Planning Commission before it is put up for a vote before the full City Council.\nThe rezoning will affect four\nnon-contiguous areas\nof Midtown South, bounded by 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Eighth Avenue to the west. The areas are zoned for manufacturing use, and either bar housing construction or limit it considerably.\nThe Council reduced the residential density permitted in a four-block area within the southeast portion of the rezoning, between 23rd and 27th streets. The maximum residential floor area ratio in that perimeter was reduced from 18 to 15.\nThe Council also removed a planned high-density residential designation midblock between West 36th and 40th streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues. Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the subcommittee, indicated that those changes would not have a significant impact on the housing expected to be built under the rezoning because the city did not expect properties in that area to be redeveloped as housing.\nHeight limits were also introduced in certain sections of the rezoning area.\nAhead of the votes, Council member Erik Bottcher noted concerns raised by fashion-related businesses in the Garment District that they would be driven out of the area as landlords emptied their buildings to redevelop their properties. Bottcher said the modified rezonings ensure that \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side.\u201d\n\nThe rezoning marks the first time that the city has mapped new residential districts, known as R11 and R12. The districts, created as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, respectively permit a residential floor area ratio (FAR) of 15 and 18, allowing housing projects to be 15 or 18 times larger than their lot sizes.\nThe city was able to create the new districts after the state lifted a restriction on residential density in the city last year. Residential FAR was previously capped at 12.\nThe rezoning is also the first time that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing has been used in Midtown Manhattan.\nLeading up to Wednesday\u2019s votes, elected officials and community members discussed scaling back the rezoning. One proposal called for significantly reducing density in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area, where the city wants to allow residential space with an FAR of 18. City Planning testified during a hearing last month that such a change would result in a 55 percent loss of housing.\nWednesday\u2019s changes were not as drastic.\nCommunity Board 4 called for height limits and suggested a special permit for any residential building where the developer wishes to exceed an FAR of 12. The changes were driven, in part, to disincentivize developers from demolishing their properties.\nAs the first neighborhood rezoning to employ the new residential districts, Midtown South is a critical test for the City Council. The administration did not try to map the districts in another\nmajor rezoning in Long Island City\n, where the highest FAR for residential space under the rezoning will be 12.\nThe inability to approve these districts in a dense, transit-rich area of Midtown Manhattan would jeopardize the chances of doing so elsewhere in the city. In other words, if Midtown wasn\u2019t able to be successfully rezoned under City of Yes, it likely wouldn\u2019t happen anywhere else.\n",

Details regarding the ground lease\u2019s structure were not disclosed.\nA JLL team including Andrew Scandalios, David Giancola and Drew Isaacson represented the Wallaces in the lease deal.\nTF Cornerstone will transform the 32-story office building into a 350-unit residential complex, featuring both market-rate and affordable housing; 25 percent of the units will be for those earning up to 80 percent of the area median income. The property has a \u201cvery properly dimensioned floorplate for residential\u201d use, according to principal Jeremy Shell.\nThe developer plans to tap into the state\u2019s 467m tax exemption program, which helps facilitate the conversion of office buildings to residential properties. TF Cornerstone aims to wrap the project by 2028.\n\nThe curved tower on Billionaires\u2019 Row was\nput on the market\nlast year following a lengthy fight between Cohen and the Wallace clan. William Wallace sued to evict Cohen after he allegedly defaulted on the lease in early 2023 and started skipping out on paying millions of city property taxes.\nHe also neglected repairs, according to court documents, prompting retail tenant Saks Off Fifth to begin another court action and stop paying rent.\nCohen pushed back on the eviction attempt, laying the blame for his struggles on office vacancies and low demand. He also said Wallace gave an \u201cunreasonable refusal\u201d to a plan to\nconvert the office and retail property\ninto a residential condominium; it\u2019s unclear how Cohen\u2019s conversion would\u2019ve compared to TF Cornerstone\u2019s.\nLast year, TF Cornerstone and Dune Real Estate Partners\ncreated a $1 billion venture\nto advance office-to-residential conversions across the country.

        "content": "Despite downplaying his family\u2019s influential commercial property business while campaigning,\nreal estate scion Jason Friedman\nis emerging as a favorite among industry players to fill Rep. Danny Davis\u2019 soon-to-be-vacated House seat in the March 17 primary election.\nFriedman has raised more than $1 million in donations and is so far the only candidate in a crowded field to report fundraising totals in the race for Illinois\u2019 seventh district.\nMore than 200 of his 600-plus donations have been tied to real estate professionals, according to federal election data. Prominent donors include Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Blue Star Properties\u2019 Craig Golden, AMLI Residential CEO Gregory T. Mutz, CRG\u2019s CEO Shawn Clark and MZ Capital Partners\u2019 Michael Zaransky.\nAt least eight other challengers have recently joined the race, including state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who Davis endorsed last week. Next quarter\u2019s fundraising results will likely reveal more nuances about the candidates\u2019 coalitions.\nOther Chicago business heavyweights who have cut checks for Friedman include private investment billionaire Craig Duchossois and multiple Linden Capital Partners executives.\nFriedman\u2019s father\n, the founder of Friedman Properties, referred to as the \u201cMayor of River North,\u201d is also among his donors, as is one of the firm\u2019s retail tenants, the well-known restaurateur behind the Lettuce Entertain You empire, Richard Melman.\nWhoever takes over the seat will step in at a crucial time for the district, which has been hammered by distress in the commercial real estate market following the pandemic. The district stretches from Lawndale to River North and from the Loop to Oak Pak.\nOver Friedman Properties\u2019 55 years in the business, it has amassed a 5 million-square-foot commercial real estate portfolio, developed towers and preserved architectural landmarks. Its properties span the retail, office, multifamily and hotel sectors. Jason Friedman served as president of his father\u2019s company from 2005 until 2023.\nHe describes his approach to policymaking as one of \u201cabundance,\u201d referring to a book of the same title by political commentators Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. The emerging political rallying call is seen among the center-left as a way to tackle issues like housing affordability via both government investment and certain kinds of deregulation.\nThe Real Deal\nspoke with Friedman about how his real estate experience will influence his campaign. Because the district is considered safely Democratic, the winner of the primary will be strongly favored in the following November general election.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nTRD:\nYou previously worked in government but what made you want to step back into politics now as a candidate?\nJF:\nI felt that our existing public officials just weren\u2019t fighting for us anymore. This needs to be a place that people want to invest in again and that people want to raise their families in again. This particular congressional district is the most diverse district in the state of Illinois, maybe one of the most diverse in the United States. It\u2019s also the economic engine of our city and state. It\u2019s where the majority of these big real estate developments take place and where a lot of people are employed and where all of the corporations are.\nTRD:\nYour father, Albert Friedman, has been nicknamed the mayor of River North and you spent 18 years as president of his company, Friedman Properties. What role will your real estate background play in your approach to politics?\nJF:\nReal estate is an industry of collaboration. In order to build a building, you have to have a good relationship with your public officials [and] with the community, and you have to deal with union labor, good paying jobs, minority contracting and really helping businesses and entrepreneurs. It\u2019s not dissimilar from being in public service.\nTRD:\nChicago ranked 45th in construction starts per capita, according to a recent study of the 50 largest metro areas in the U.S. by Apartment List. Impact for Equity also found that the Chicago Housing Authority has 19,000 fewer homes than it did 10 years ago. At the current pace of building, the CHA won\u2019t be able to redevelop all the vacant land created by public housing demolitions for another 30 to 40 years. How do you plan to address the city\u2019s shortage of both subsidized and market rate housing?\nJF:\nIt\u2019s a huge problem. The secret sauce for achieving more affordable housing is through more supply. It\u2019s through growth. It\u2019s through this abundance strategy and the idea that Chicago and some of these other great cities have created such restrictions on the ability for developers and for owners to build that we need to figure out a way to streamline that process.\nTRD:\nWe hear a lot of that conversation on the local level, particularly at City Hall, but how does a congressperson, specifically, play a role in this issue?\nJF\n: Every aspect and chain of government is related. I would work with every alderman here. I would certainly work with the mayor\u2019s office to create pathways to business success and good public stewardship for housing abundance. The other thing we can do on a federal level is create better pathways for home ownership for first-time home buyers.\nTRD:\nTell me about your other campaign priorities and how you plan to balance representing this district. It\u2019s very economically and ethnically diverse so there may be a lot of competing priorities.\nJF:\nYou know, it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t think there are. The community is very diverse, from Chinatown to Oak Park and from North Lawndale to Fulton Market or River North, [but] for a lot of people, the top issues are the same, which are pathways to business success, public safety and access to education. You should have the same education regardless of your zip code. You should grow up with affordability, and that\u2019s affordability in housing and affordability in health care. Sometimes we just look at it through different lenses but there\u2019s a pathway through and a lane that\u2019s the same for all of us.\n",

        "content": "The developers of Ritz-Carlton Residences, South Beach are moving forward with plans to revamp a portion of Lincoln Road.\nMiami Beach commissioners approved a resolution last month for the streetscape improvement agreement covering the 100-300 blocks of Lincoln Road. A partnership between Lionstone Development, the Ben-Josef Group and Flag Luxury Group are kicking in $4 million for the $12 million first phase, which includes the beach entrance and the 100 block.\nFlag Luxury, Lionstone and Ben-Josef, owners of the existing Sagamore and Ritz-Carlton South Beach hotels at 1671 Collins Avenue and 1 Lincoln Road, plan a\n15-story, 30-unit condo tower\non the property, which the developers are branding Billionaires\u2019 Beach.\nPricing for the condos started at $4.3 million and run as high as $125 million for a combined penthouse. The development, designed by Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design, will include 50,000 square feet of amenities. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team is leading sales. In April, Fredrik Eklund posted on Instagram that buyers signed three contracts totaling $44 million in new deals at the project, adding to previously undisclosed presales.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences will be completed in 2028, according to a spokesperson for the project.\nThe\nLincoln Road\nstreetscape project could be completed at the same time or toward the end of construction of the condo project. The city will manage construction. A city memo issued in July stated that the design will be completed by next spring. Construction could start in the spring of 2027 and be completed within a year.\n\nCommissioner Alex Fernandez, who sponsored the resolution, said the project will help \u201cbring back safety, bring back beauty and pride to this neglected area.\u201d\nPeter Kanavos, a partner and senior vice president of planning and development at Flag Luxury Group, told commissioners that he expects about $1.8 million to $2 million of the developers\u2019 contribution to go toward soft costs, which includes the design. Naturalficial, led by Andres Arcila, is designing the 100 block of Lincoln Road to include a display of public art, traffic and life safety improvements and a Morris Lapidus-inspired gateway monument.\nThe county bus stop is expected to be relocated to\nWashington Avenue\n, Kanavos said.\nThe state is also contributing nearly $4.9 million in funding for hard costs, and the city is providing another $4 million in funding.\nAcross from the Ritz, Alo Yoga plans to open a new store and private health club that will take the place of a shuttered Walgreens pharmacy on the ground floor of the Decoplage condominium at 100 Lincoln Road. The Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board\napproved\nAlo\u2019s plans earlier this year.\nSobe Sky Development, the Flag Luxury, Ben-Josef and Lionstone venture, is also involved in later phases to revamp the 200 and 300 blocks of Lincoln Road.\n",

The asking price hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The property sat empty for about a year after the local grocery store chain went out of business in 2018. Optima paid $12.85 million for the property in 2019.\nOptima, which based in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Glencoe, leveled the store and took out a construction loan from Village Bank &amp; Trust, then refinanced the property last March with $56 million from PNC Bank, the outlet said. The refinancing amounted to $281,400 per unit.\nThe building is more than 90 percent leased with rents of $4.13 per square foot, nearly $4,400 per unit. The building features a rooftop deck with a pool, spa, party room, fire pits and grill stations, along with private balconies, indoor basketball and pickleball courts, a putting green and fitness center. JLL is marketing the property as a rare large apartment development in a high-density neighborhood.\n\nA slow construction pipeline and high demand for apartments has led to rent growth and increased investor interest in Chicago this year.\nChicago-area apartment sales totaled $4 billion in 2023, $3.9 billion in 2024 and clocked in at $2.3 billion halfway through this year. Major sales this year include the 375-unit\nFulbrix tower\nin Fulton Market for $170 million.\nSales of large apartment complexes on the North Side this year include the 292-unit Cobbler Square building in Old Town for $87 million, or $298,000 per unit, and the 191-unit Elevate Lincoln Park building for $114 million, or $597,000 per unit.

The July incident, now under federal investigation, involved quarterly PILOT and ground-lease payments collected from condo owners \u2014 fees that typically pass through building management to the BPCA.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is leading a multi-agency probe.\nMilford confirmed the fraud in a brief statement, noting the funds involved properties both owned and managed by its affiliates. The company declined further comment to the outlet, citing the active investigation.\nThe scam appears to have targeted the automated infrastructure of PILOT payments \u2014 a quasi-property tax structure unique to Battery Park City, where condo owners pay into a fund that\u2019s funneled to the state-run BPCA.\n\nMilford, which oversees at least nine buildings and more than 2,000 units in the neighborhood, serves as intermediary for a sizable share of those payments.\nThe BPCA said it never received the payment and was not itself affected. But fallout from the scam has rippled through the neighborhood. One condo board was told $3.5 million of its dues vanished in the transfer.\nThe BPC Homeowners Coalition, which represents 18 buildings, warned residents in an email that the attack \u2014 likely the first of its kind in the area\u2014won\u2019t be the last, urging buildings to review cybersecurity protocols.\nThe need for strong cybersecurity is only likely to grow in the industry, especially as cryptocurrency becomes more omnipresent in transactions.\nLast year, a homebuyer\nfiled a federal lawsuit\nagainst his lawyer and the lawyer\u2019s firm in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The buyer blamed the attorneys for a loss of almost $600,000, claiming hackers accessed the firm\u2019s private emails to obtain key information about the transaction, enabling hackers to walk off with $726,000, of which the banks were only able to recover $129,000.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The last three transactions recorded on\nStreetEasy\nwere for two-bedroom units, all commanding at least $7,000 in rent.\nThere\u2019s also 27,000 square feet of retail space, spread across the bottom three floors. Tenants include the Veterinary Emergency Group, which paid a starting rent of $128 per square foot for its 5,000-square-foot space. The property has a net operating income of $4.4 million, according to Meridian\u2019s marketing materials.\n\nDouble U and Lincoln did not respond to the outlet\u2019s requests for comment, while Rockpoint declined to comment.\nThree months ago, Double U\nfiled permits\nto convert a vacant two-story building at 144 Greenpoint Avenue into a six-story mixed-use building. The plans call for a 6,200-square-foot ground floor retail space and 35 apartments perched above.\nElsewhere in Williamsburg, CIM Group and Osiris Ventures recently\nsnapped up\n190 Berry Street from LENY for $55.7 million out of bankruptcy. The property includes a 40-unit apartment building and adjoining retail buildings.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A consortium that includes retired Latin American sports stars landed an 80-year ground lease to develop a $275 million sports-themed mixed-use project in Homestead.\nLast week, the\nHomestead\nCity Council approved the agreement with Ponte Vedra Beach-based VSGS Facilities, which is planning Sports Performance Hub of Miami-Dade, a complex consisting of a 10,000-seat multipurpose stadium, a hotel with 100 to 150 rooms, a sports academy and a new public park with recreational amenities including pickleball, tennis and basketball courts.\nVSGS would build the project on 112.5 acres within the city-owned Homestead Regional Park at 1601 Southeast 28 Avenue.\nThe firm is led by Dar\u00edo Sala and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, two Argentine former professional soccer players. Other VSGS partners include Argentine retired professional basketball player and NBA Hall of Famer\nManu Gin\u00f3bili\n; ex-professional tennis players Juan \u201cPico\u201d M\u00f3naco and Mariano Zabaleta; and\nRiccardo Silva\n, a real estate investor and owner of Miami FC, a professional soccer team that plays in the USL Championship league.\nMiami FC would play its home games in the planned stadium, which would also host other sporting events, including the Homestead Championship Rodeo, city documents state.\nVSGS\nhad previously been negotiating with Miami-Dade County to build the project on county-owned land near Homestead Air Reserve Base. A VSGS spokesperson said the firm withdrew its proposal to the county.\n\nThe developer submitted a letter of intent to Homestead in May, and city officials began negotiations with VSGS the same month, Homestead City Manager Nzeribe \u201cZerry\u201d Ihekwaba said at the July 30 city council meeting.\nHomestead Mayor Steven Losner, who participated in the negotiations, said the lease terms were vetted by the city\u2019s financial consultants, and the city and VSGS came to an agreement on the property\u2019s fair market value.\n\u201cThese folks are going to make a significant equity contribution,\u201d Losner told his council colleagues. \u201cWe have hard and fast and clear obligations on both sides of this deal.\u201d\nUnder the ground lease approved by the Homestead city council, VSGS agreed to pay the city $200,000 upon starting construction, which is planned for early next year, the agreement shows.\nThe developer will pay the city another $300,000 while the project is under construction. In 2030, when the project is expected to be completed, VSGS will pay $500,000 in annual rent for a five-year period. Thereafter, the firm will pay $852,000 annually. VSGS also agreed to share a percentage of revenues derived from sports event ticket sales, hotel rooms and naming rights.",

        "content": "Spec developer David Maman has placed his latest creation, with views of the Getty Center and Downtown Los Angeles, on the market for $38 million.\nDavid Maman Design and Development is the builder and seller behind the nine-bedroom, 14-bathroom home at 1204 Chickory Lane in\nBrentwood\n. It has 15,000 square feet of contemporary design sitting above a private cul-de-sac. The three-level mansion boasts a primary suite with its own private patio, bar, temperature-controlled wine cellar, screening room, wellness center, outdoor kitchen, pool, staff quarters and an eight-car garage.\nMaman purchased the property in 2021 through Maman Properties LLC for $5.8 million from Chickory Lane LLC, according to property records. Chickory LLC is managed by Bill Zutter and operates as an investment rental business tied to a Florida address, according to filings with the state Following his purchase, Maman went on to build the home anew and completed it this year.\nThe Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana is marketing the property.\nThe listing comes after Maman\u2019s March sale of\n1050 Stradella Road\nin Bel Air for $25 million. The closing price was a steep cut from the $33.8 million the new build originally hit the market for in March 2024. It had most recently been listed for just under $29 million before the closing.\nArana was also the listing agent on the 16,000-square-foot Stradella Road deal. It was bought with Pinnacle Real Estate Group\u2019s Sam Mu representing husband-and-wife Gang Ji and Ting Zhang, according to property records.\n\nWhile some have called out a shift to a buyer\u2019s market in Los Angeles\u2019 high end, data from Douglas Elliman offers a mixed view in the second quarter.\nThe median sales price for the single-family luxury home market in L.A. increased 6.5 percent to $13.8 million year-over-year, according to the Elliman Report produced by Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants. The overall number of transactions totaled 71 in the second quarter, which was up 7.6 percent from the same three months in 2025.\nProperties also appear to be sitting on the market for shorter periods at 51 days, which is down 5.6 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe market data may be lagging from what some agents are seeing play out currently, while also hinting at what could materialize in the third-quarter Elliman Report.\nElliman noted bidding wars were down from 25.5 percent of transactions in the second quarter of last year to 21.3 percent in the same three months in 2025, potentially hinting at a cooling. Meanwhile, the report suggests the pace of dealmaking, a gauge of how quickly the market can burn through and sell available inventory, slowed to 21.8 percent annually.\n",

        "content": "Weeks after completing a $343 capital raise, Scott Everett\u2019s S2 Capital is buying up industrial operator Fort Capital.\nFort Capital has an 11 million-square-foot industrial portfolio and a pipeline of $350 million in targeted acquisitions, according to a release from S2.\nThe Dallas-based multifamily syndicator is hiring Chris Roach as president of the new vertical; Parker McCormack is coming on as chief investment officer.\nFort, which was founded by Chris Powers in 2010, focuses on value-add industrial assets in high-growth markets. Specifically, it specializes in shallow-bay infill properties.\nIn a statement, Everett pointed to the growth of e-commerce and rising transportation costs as the reasoning for S2\u2019s foray into industrial real estate.\nNews of the merger comes after S2 announced the closure of its second value-add fund.\n\nThe capital was raised from investors like multifamily offices and public pensions. The fund will target distressed assets that it can upgrade, and 60 percent of the capital has already been invested in 14 properties in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas.\nS2 closed its first multifamily fund in September 2022 at $400 million. It hasn\u2019t returned capital from this fund, but it landed a $500 million refi deal that provided distributions to limited partners.\nEverett has been more successful at dealing with the higher interest rate environment than syndicator peers like Rise48 and Tides Equities.\nIn an effort to shield his syndicated deals from the floating-rate debt that was the downfall of his peers, he launched the\nbiggest private REIT\nlast year. Everett capitalized on his survivor status by taking a\nbig bite of syndicator GVA\u2019s distress mess\n. S2 joined as a general partner on a $60 million recapitalization deal.\nEven so, there have been speed bumps along the way. The firm faced foreclosure on an apartment complex last month after appearing to default on a\n$36 million mortgage\nprovided by CBRE for Preslee Apartments, at 2504 Ivy Brook Court in Arlington. The 290-unit apartment complex was built in 1981. The loan amounted to $124,000 per unit.\n",

Of those California buyers, 57 percent were from Asia or Oceania, followed by Latin America at 18 percent.\nHomebuyers from China led the way, accounting for 15 percent of the homes in the U.S. purchased by foreigners. California was the \u201ctop destination\u201d for Chinese buyers, according to the report.\n\u201cChinese buyers are drawn to California due to its proximity to China, business opportunities from moving to the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, and stronger cultural ties to the population in certain markets,\u201d Matt Christopherson, a business and consumer research director at the National Association of Realtors, told SF Gate. \u201cAdditionally, low affordability in California brings strong rental demand, presenting an opportunity for those investment buyers purchasing residential rentals.\u201d\n\nReal estate professionals saw a 33 percent increase in international clients compared to the year prior, according to the data cited by SF Gate. In total, buyers from outside the U.S. spent $56 billion on homes in the country from April 2024 to March 2025, gobbling up 34,400 homes, up from 23,300 the year before.\nAll-cash deals were especially popular among international buyers in the U.S. due in part to limited housing stock, currency exchange rates and stagnant mortgage rates, according to the report cited by SF Gate. During the April-to-March study period, 56 percent of international buyers bought homes in cash. That number was even higher among Chinese homebuyers, with 71 percent buying properties in cash at an average home price of $1.2 million.\nThe report aligns with\nanecdotal evidence from Bay Area real state agents\nwho recently told the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nabout their changing client base.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Multifamily syndicator Rise48 Equity is following a familiar playbook with its latest transaction in a suburb northeast of Dallas.\nThe Arizona-based firm purchased a 248-unit apartment complex at 2379 Apollo Road in Garland, Bisnow\nreported\n. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the firm said it was a 30 percent discount to the property\u2019s value a few years ago. It was an off-market transaction without competition, the firm\u2019s co-founder and CEO Zach Haptonstall said.\nThe seller was Redondo Beach, California-based Wedgewood, which had 86 percent ownership, along with entities named GDD Holdings and West Ridge Rentals, according to property tax records. The complex was valued for tax purposes this year at $32.8 million, or $132,000 per unit. One- and two-bedroom apartments in the complex are advertised online for about $1,200 to $1,700 a month.\nThe buyer plans to renovate 88 percent of units at the Shiloh Oaks Apartments and rebrand the property as Rise Apollo Heights. The firm\u2019s \u201cvalue-add\u201d plans for the 40-year-old complex include adding in-unit washers and dryers and stainless-steel appliances, as well as updating the lighting, plumbing and fixtures. Landscaping, exterior paint and renovations to the pool and clubhouse are also planned.\nHaptonstall founded the firm in 2019, and it deals primarily in Phoenix and Dallas. It focuses on acquiring, renovating and reselling value-add apartments.\n\nFloating-rate debt put some multifamily syndicators in distress a few years ago, following interest-rate hikes. In November 2023, $256 million in debt tied to Rise48 buildings was\nwatchlisted\n, according to Trepp and Morningstar Credit. The loans tied to that debt accounted for seven Phoenix-area assets comprising over 1,700 units. However, Rise48\ndisputed that it was in distress\n.\nThe firm acquired at least three DFW multifamily properties last year.\nOne of them was a 144-unit apartment complex at 2929 Kings Road on the edge of Dallas\u2019 Oaklawn and Park Cities neighborhoods, which it bought\nwith a $21 million loan\n. The debt amounted to $145,800 per unit.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate and LCOR want to take over the remaining railyard development sites at Pacific Park, as well as a separate property known as Site 5.\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday, Empire State Development confirmed the developers submitted an application to be designated as a \u201cpermitted\u201d developer of six railyard sites in the long-stalled Brooklyn megadevelopment. The development rights were supposed to be transferred to a new team, approved by ESD, by Aug. 1, with millions of dollars of late fees on the line. Now, the deadline has once again been extended.\nESD officials indicated that Greenland, the current Pacific Park developer, along with the U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress Investment Group, would be part of the joint venture with Cirrus and LCOR, but would not have an active role in managing the development. Their involvement would be financial, based on their previous investments in the development sites, the officials said.\nCirrus and LCOR are also applying to take over Site 5, home to a former Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son near the Barclays Center. Greenland, which currently controls Site 5, would also remain part of that joint venture.\nPrevious\nplans for the site included two office towers, and Greenland has also proposed housing on the site. The Modell\u2019s space is currently\nbeing used\nfor a youth basketball training facility.\nPacific Park was supposed to be done by now. Thanks to a 2014 agreement with the city, Greenland was on the hook to finish the project\u2019s 2,250 affordable apartments by the end of May 2025. Failing to do so meant the developer would need to pay millions of dollars in fines.\nWith 876 affordable units yet to be built and no platform over the train tracks to accommodate the development, Greenland did not meet the deadline. In\nMay, the state\nannounced\nthat it would not fine Greenland. Instead, ESD set new deadlines\nAs part of the new deadlines, ESD pledged to approve the new development team for the railyard site by Aug. 1, but officials said Wednesday that the team\u2019s application for Site 5 extended the amount of time the agency needs for its review. Officials now say they are hoping to approve the development team by the end of September.\n\nESD\u2019s Arden Sokolow said Greenland has challenged the enforceability of the fines, arguing that it has faced \u201cunavoidable delays.\u201d Sokolow indicated that imposing the fines at this point could result in litigation and disrupt the project just as a new development team is poised to take over.\nAccording to the new parameters set by the state, the development team must have a \u201cfeasible\u201d project framework and new timeline for taking the project through public review.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported that\nCirrus\nand\nLCOR\nwere preparing to take over the site. ESD needs to sign off on the replacement developers for the platform sites, as well as Site 5.\nThe development rights for the railyard sites still need to be officially transferred through a foreclosure auction. In 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million worth of loans tied to the sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s U.S. Immigration Fund, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owns a stake in the debt.\nPacific Park, formerly known as Atlantic Yards, was first\nannounced\nmore than 20 years ago. The project faced years of litigation, construction mishaps and financial hardships, in the form of global economic crises and distress within the balance sheets of the development firms leading the project.\nCirrus\u2019 portfolio of projects has grown rapidly in the past year. Last year, Cirrus reached a deal with the Building and Construction Trades Council and City Hall to invest in multifamily workforce housing and redevelopments by pooling pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions. Since then, the company has also announced that it will partner with Resorts World Casino New York City to build 50,000 housing units over the next 20 years. Last week, the city\ntapped\nCirrus and LCOR to build 3,000 housing units at a former airport in Queens.\n",

        "content": "Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee\u2019s Shoma Group secured nearly $30 million in financing for its planned North Bay Village condo project.\nCoral Gables-based Shoma obtained a predevelopment loan from Forman Capital for Shoma Bay, according to a press release. The $29.9 million loan will be used to pay off an existing loan that\u2019s backed by the property at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nShoma Bay will be a 24-story, 333-unit luxury condo building with a 36,068-square-foot Publix Supermarket on the ground floor, as well as another 15,628 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nThe building is more than 30 percent presold with about $97 million in presales, according to the release. Units start in the $800,000s. Craig Studnicky\u2019s ISG World is handling sales of the project.\nAmenities will include a rooftop pool deck with cabanas and an outdoor kitchen; a golf simulator and virtual reality gaming; a fitness center and spa.\nIn July, Shoma Group CEO Masoud Shojaee\nreceived an extra month\nto secure a master building permit for Shoma Bay. Shoma now has until Halloween to secure the permit.\nThe deadline was previously set for Aug. 30. The commission voted 4 to 1 to amend the development agreement. Shoma wasn\u2019t able to obtain a master permit due to\nmillions of dollars in fees\nowed to the village, the South Florida Business Journal reported earlier this year.\nShoma\u2019s attorney, Mario Garcia-Serra, suggested that the developer may seek another amendment to increase the project density by 53 units, from 119 units per acre to 150 units per acre. The height could increase about 40 feet, or four additional stories.\n\nThe Shojaees plan to live in one of the penthouses, according to a press release issued last year about the groundbreaking.\nThe units in the tower, as currently approved, range from 344-square-foot studios to 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom condos, plus 10 townhouses.\nShoma\npaid about $16 million\nfor the site in May 2022, with plans for a rental apartment tower and retail development anchored by Publix. North Bay Village approved the project that year.\nBut Shoma changed course to build condos instead of rentals, a strategy that a handful of other developers have deployed as multifamily projects have been too costly to build.\nThe project\u2019s estimated completion date is now the end of 2027. It was previously the first quarter of 2027, Shojaee said at the July meeting.\nDevelopment is heating up in the village. At the same commission meeting last month, a joint venture between the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group and Harry Macklowe Properties secured approval for their planned two-tower luxury condo development. It will include two 498-foot, 43-story waterfront buildings at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive.\nThe\nEichner\nfamily\u2019s Continuum Company plans to redevelop the former Shuckers-anchored property, now called the Palm Tree Club, into more than 500 condos, 200 hotel rooms and a marina.\nThe largest planned development is the Ansin family\u2019s phased project that includes land north and south of the 79th Street Causeway, which bisects the town.",

        "content": "Los Angeles County has unveiled its plan to help rebuild unincorporated areas torched by\nwildfires\nearly this year.\nThe new\nL.A. County Forward: Blueprint for Rebuilding\nplan details how officials and residents can rebuild in a low-cost, streamlined approach to recovery efforts,\nL.A. Business First\nreported. The outline is designed for the county to create an \u201cequitable reconstruction\u201d process and better support rebuilding residents in unincorporated areas as their properties emerge from the ashes.\nAs part of the city of Los Angeles, the Pacific Palisades has relied on the city for permits and other hurdles to rebuilding. But residents of unincorporated areas affected by the fires, such as Altadena in the Eaton burn zone and Sunset Mesa between the Palisades and Malibu, have to go through the county instead.\nThe plan emphasizes six priorities for the county that officials believe are paramount to rebuilding. They include streamlining permitting resources, reducing building costs, restoring critical infrastructure, mobilizing a stronger workforce, expanding the pool of builders and bringing back public assets and services.\nThe county is looking to support a \u201cfeasible financial path\u201d forward through unlocking financial support for families and businesses and lowering upfront construction costs by directing homeowners to affordable rebuilding plans and contractors. Additionally, homeowners will receive more than $50 million in direct relief funding.\nL.A. County also intends to waive certain non-life-threatening requirements, such as temporary pauses on new rules for rooftop solar\u00a0 and other efficiency standards that will help simplify rebuilding. The local government is also expediting reviews for like-for-like rebuilds and will allow self-inspections for licensed architects and engineers, open one-stop permitting centers and provide new technological tools to streamline approvals.\n\n\u201cAs we turn the page from recovery to rebuilding, we\u2019re doing it with a clear plan, strong partnerships, and the urgency this moment demands,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom\nsaid\nof the findings. \u201cThis report creates a step-by-step guide to accelerate rebuilding and provide support to impacted families.\u201d\nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger, who represents residents in the Eaton fire burn zone, said in a\nstatement\nthat the plan is \u201can essential roadmap forward\u201d that marks \u201ca shift from debris removal to reconstruction that will help residents and businesses navigate the path home with greater clarity and support.\u201d\n\u201cThis blueprint shows what\u2019s possible when multiple levels of government, private industry, philanthropy and community partners come together with urgency to facilitate large-scale solutions,\u201d Barger said.\nTo date, Los Angeles County has issued 164 rebuilding permits in the affected areas, including 148 in the Eaton fire burn zone and 16 in the Palisades area, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\nThe county and its partners plan to use the report\u2019s guidance over the next 120 days. Next steps include planning for more than 150 miles of infrastructure lines for electricity, gas and telecommunications.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Milligan clan sold a massive Ventura County site that has been in limbo for decades to Hearthstone for $59.4 million, according to property records and a source involved in the project.\nThe price for the 271-acre site amounts to $219,200 per acre.\nThe vacant nine-parcel deal for Hitch Ranch in Moorpark, a city about 50 miles northwest of Downtown Los Angeles, includes a purchase option agreement with Lennar.\nHearthstone, an investor in residential development, will finance and complete the land development, and then sell the lots to homebuilders, including Comstock and Lennar, to erect 755 homes, said Debra Geiler, vice president of entitlements and forward planning for Comstock.\nEl Segundo-based development firm Comstock Homes has had control of the site via a private agreement with the Milligan family for about 10 years, Geiler said. The firm took the project through its entitlement process and then sold its interest to Hearthstone.\nNow Comstock and Lennar are focused on architectural review and compliance with the specific plan, and before moving on to permitting of the housing.\nHitch Ranch doesn\u2019t have an address, but it\u2019s located in Moorpark, a city of roughly 36,000 people, \u201cnorth of Poindexter Avenue, west of Casey Road, and extending approximately 1,700 feet to the west of Gabbert Road,\u201d according to the Moorpark community development department\u2019s website.\n\nThe site was once a hillside for grazing and farming. Its namesake is Archibald Hitch, whose\nfamily migrated\nfrom Tennessee in the early 1900s and farmed apricots and lemons on the site, according to project material.\nDifferent versions of the project have been bandied about for over 30 years, according to Doug Spondello, community development director for the City of Moorpark, who reviews entitlement requests like those for Hitch Ranch.\nComstock filed its initial plans with the city in 2019, and the final environmental impact report was approved by the Moorpark City Council in June 2022.\nProposed housing types at Hitch Ranch include multifamily, smaller single-family starter homes, larger-lot single families and move-up housing. Fifteen percent of the 755 homes will be allocated for affordable housing, Spondello said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that envisioned housing affordability in every category,\u201d Geiler said.\nIn addition to the 755 homes, Hitch Ranch is slated to include a 6-acre public park, open space, associated roadways and infrastructure.\nHitch Ranch isn\u2019t the only big development underway in Moorpark.\nAdjacent to Hitch Ranch is developer James Rasmussen\u2019s 68-acre North Ranch, a project slated to have 134 detached single-family homes, five 5-acre estate homesites, and 20 affordable homes.\n",

Arbor purchased the resort from an affiliate of AllianceBernstein, which had taken over the property in 2022 to resolve a distressed $29 million mortgage.\nThe price was probably below the outstanding loan balance due to declining property values at a time of rising interest rates, the outlet reported. Jones Lang LaSalle\u2019s Adam McGaughy and John Nugent brokered the sale.\nThe acquisition signals a strategic pivot for Arbor, which typically invests in traditional urban hotels. Eaglewood has a 295-room hotel that caters to corporate guests but also includes unique features such as a championship golf course, a spa, a bowling alley and 39,000 square feet of meeting space. It is Arbor\u2019s first venture into golf resort ownership, reflecting broader industry trends since the pandemic.\nGolf courses, once seen as money-losing assets, have become profitable as participation in the sport has surged. Arbor CEO Vamsi Bonthala described Eaglewood as a \u201cunique and irreplaceable asset\u201d with significant potential to grow as a destination for corporate meetings and events.\n\nArbor\u2019s interest in golf comes shortly after the company sold its Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago at a steep loss compared to its 2018 purchase price, underscoring the financial pressures faced by urban hotels in the post-pandemic era.\nIn contrast, Bonthala is optimistic about suburban hospitality assets like Eaglewood, especially given their accessibility and appeal to corporate groups seeking in-person gatherings. He emphasized the resort\u2019s proximity to O\u2019Hare Airport and the suburbs north and west of Chicago strategic advantages.\nThe purchase also reflects a growing trend of non-traditional investors \u2014 such as hotel operators and private equity firms \u2014 entering the golf industry, driving up property values. Arbor financed the acquisition with a loan, though details were not disclosed.\nOriginally built in 1971 and expanded in 2002, Eaglewood has a colorful history, including serving as a site for weight-loss retreats modeled on \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201d The resort had been owned by Denver-based Amstar until 2022, when it was turned over to AllianceBernstein.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "A poster child for Houston office distress is still bleeding even after it secured a lifeline earlier this summer.\nOne Riverway is losing law firm Wright Close &amp; Barger, which signed a 41,000-square-foot lease to occupy TC Energy Center, at 700 Louisiana Street in downtown Houston, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe firm is exiting 777 South Post Oak Lane in the Galleria. That 507,000-square-foot building has been\nscheduled for auction at least seven times\nin the last few years. Its owners, Israel-based Azrieli Group and Beverly Hills-based Unilev Capital, finally scored a recapitalization deal with lender German American Capital Corporation earlier this summer, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe deal includes a\nloan modification\nand additional equity with which the owners plan to renovate the common areas and build spec suites.\nBut it hasn\u2019t staunched the bleeding of the emptying building.\nThe law firm\u2019s exit frees up about 5 percent of the space at One Riverway. In 2024, the building lost Houston-based law firm Thompson, Coe, Cousins &amp; Irons, which leased 11 percent of the building.\n\nThe building was 51 percent occupied in December. The owners first fell behind on payments on the property\u2019s $80 million mortgage in June 2023.\nTC Energy Center is one of downtown Houston\u2019s most recognizable properties. Built in 1983, the 56-story, 1.5 million-square-foot tower is made of red granite and features a three-part gabled roof rising on an incline. It\u2019s owned by Houston-based M-M Properties.\nFounding partner Tom Wright called downtown \u201cthe heart of our legal community\u201d\nThe property was saved from default when the owner reached a deal with lender Starwood Property Trust to modify its $252 million mortgage last year, Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The owner raised $30 million for renovations last year. The last round of updates took place in 2017 and cost about $20 million.\nPreviously the Bank of America Center, the building was renamed when TC Energy signed a lease in 2019.\n",

        "content": "The Midtown South rezoning was a test. What does this mean for future upzonings?\nThe City Council Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises on Wednesday advanced the 42-block rezoning, but trimmed 165 units from the original plan.\nThe changes that reduced the projected unit count were not as extensive as some had sought. The Council nodded to a request to reduce residential density in the southeast portion of the rezoning area, doing so within just four blocks. It also removed a high-density residential district from the northwestern portion, leaving it as a light manufacturing zone.\nThe carveouts, as explained by the Council members, were in response to concerns raised by the garment-related businesses (manufacturers and wholesalers) that they would be pushed out as owners opted to demolish their buildings to take advantage of the upzoning.\nThe result: Instead of an estimated 9,700 units, the rezoning is expected to net 9,500 over the next decade.\nThe changes were mostly surgical and didn\u2019t make a huge dent in the projected unit count. It is important to note that these projections are just that: projections. What ultimately gets built will depend on a number of factors; things like developer whim cannot be quantified in a review intended to estimate how many apartments are likely to be built.\nThe changes to the rezoning reduced the projected housing production by just 2 percent. Still, I wonder if this is the kind of change that would trigger action by an appeals board. The Charter Revision Commission has proposed creating one that could overrule land use actions by the City Council, including modifications to rezonings. It\u2019s a small reduction in housing, but a board might find that any reduction (within the city\u2019s power) is unacceptable.\nThe rezoning is the first to map two new residential districts, R11 and R12, that were created as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The designations allow residential floor area ratios of 15 and 18, respectively.\nBack in 2023, when the city was still pushing the state to lift its residential FAR cap, land use hawks\nspeculated\non what areas of the city would likely be upzoned if the state were to act. At the time, one attorney pointed to Long Island City, Midtown, Downtown Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan as \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d The administration has opted not to pluck the first, capping residential FAR in the Long Island City rezoning at 12. As I\nnoted\nearlier this week, if the City Council had failed to map those districts at all in Midtown South, chances of doing so elsewhere would be killed.\nThe fact that the Council kept most of those districts intact in Midtown South doesn\u2019t necessarily open the floodgates. And the modifications may mean that rezonings elsewhere will also include carveouts. But approval of this first rezoning might give more momentum to proposals in other high-density areas.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Where should the city try to map R11 and R12 districts next? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFormer HFZ Capital Group exec Nir Meir was a subscriber to this newsletter. Court filings included an email to Meir\u2019s HFZ email with a September 2019 edition of The Daily Dirt attached. Meir, who is accused of orchestrating an $86 million fraud scheme, was\nreleased\nfrom Rikers in June after posting bail. Thank you to\nTRD\n\u2019s Keith Larsen for passing the newsletter tidbit along!\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Campaign Finance Board again denied Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 bid for matching funds,\nthe City\nreports. The board cited Adams\u2019 now-dismissed indictment and his failure to adequately respond to questions about hundreds of suspicious donations as reasons to deny the public funding.\n\u2014 NYC has opened the country\u2019s first city-funded homeless shelter for transgender and gender non-conforming people, according to\nGothamist\n. The Long Island City facility will have 150 beds and cost $65 million to operate through 2030.\n\u2014 City Hall officials greenlit a plan for a 34th Street busway after speculation that the project had been axed,\namNY\nreports. The project got the go-ahead as part of the Midtown South rezoning. The busway would improve bus speeds by up to 15% and support the residents of the nearly 10,000 new apartments that will result from the rezoning.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$20 million\nfor a 6,163-square-foot townhouse at 230 West 11th Street in Greenwich Village. The Eklund-Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing.\nThe property last sold for\n$20 million\nin 2023.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$86 million\nfor a 34,3701-square-foot office building at 141 Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The transaction included 383 Gold Street. Savanna Funds sold the properties to Capstone Equities.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on Savanna\u2019s foreclosure in June.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,500-square-foot townhouse at 20 Charles Street in Greenwich Village. Adam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg of The Modlin Group have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a 269,062-square-foot, 282-unit project at 413 East 120th Street in East Harlem.

        "content": "Douglas Emmett is turning a Westwood office building to residences, the company announced during its second-quarter earnings call Wednesday.\nThe real estate investment trust reported that it plans to turn the office tower it purchased earlier in the year for $131 million from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure into apartments, per its second-quarter earnings\nrelease\n.\nThe 17-story, 247,000-square-foot office tower at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard called Murdock Plaza combined with a residential building it plans to construct on the same site will become a 320-apartment complex with ample amenities in Westwood. The conversion will occur over an undisclosed number of years as offices are vacated on a floor-by-floor basis. The first apartments could be ready in the next 18 months, the company said.\n\u201cIncluding the costs to acquire the property, convert the existing office tower and construct the new building, we expect this plan to increase the total project costs to approximately $200 million to $250 million,\u201d Douglas Emmett said in the earnings release Tuesday.\n\nIn the first-quarter earnings\nrelease\n, the company reported that it expected the total project to cost $150 million to $200 million for the acquisition, construction of the apartment building on Ashton Avenue and upgrades to the existing tower. The firm estimated a timeframe of three to four years, but now, the ground-up development alone is estimated to take three years.\n\u201cWe expect this conversion will not only enhance the value of 10900 Wilshire, but will also reduce office vacancy in the submarket,\u201d Douglas Emmett CEO Jordan Kaplan\nsaid\non the earnings call. Westwood office vacancies were at about 19 percent, according to a CBRE first-quarter market report.\nDouglas Emmett is converting a 21-story building in Downtown Honolulu from offices to apartments.\nOverall, Douglas Emmett\u2019s revenues increased to $252 million in the second quarter compared to $246 million a year earlier due to an uptick in office and multifamily revenue. At the same time, losses escalated to $6 million. A year ago, the company reported $11 million in income.",

The report, which is compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, tallied 17 homes that went into contract last week, which equated to $126.9 million in asking dollar volume.\nThat\u2019s down from the 19 deals inked in the week prior and also off 2.5 percent in comparison to that same seven-day period\u2019s total asking dollar volume of $130.3 million.\nOn a year-over-year basis, which some would argue is the best gauge of change, last week\u2019s asking dollar volume reflected a 7 percent decline from the year-ago period\u2019s volume. But, there were four more deals last week compared to a year earlier.\nThe data for the report, which is pulled every Sunday, listed 1600 Casale Road in Pacific Palisades as the top home to go into contract with a list price just under $20 million.\nHowever, the property, which was listed as contingent last week, fell out of contract and went back on the market Monday for $1 million less than its last listing price as it looks to attract a buyer with the new ask of just under $19 million.\nA limited liability company named 1600 Casale and tied to Keith Natvig is the seller, according to property and state records.\nThe Agency\u2019s\nSantiago Arana\nand Compass\u2019 Craig Natvig, Keith\u2019s son, hold the listing.\n\nAt 9,000 square feet, the six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home in the Palisades\u2019 Riviera neighborhood \u2014 which was not as damaged by January\u2019s fire as other parts of the community \u2014 is decked out with Smart Home technology, Tesla Powerwall batteries, an EV charging station and solar panels. It\u2019s also relatively new after construction on the gated home was completed last year.\nLast week\u2019s second home to go into contract was 10694 Somma Way in Bel Air, which is listed for $15.8 million. It was first listed in January for nearly $20 million.\nCompass\u2019\nTracy Tutor\nand Thea Sheinberg hold the listing.\nThe home was built by the Rizzoli family, whose namesake publishing business is behind the coffee table books sitting in many a Los Angeles mansion and beyond. Rizzoli also happens to be the publisher of the late\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nco-founder Jeff Hyland\u2019s book \u201cThe Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills.\u201d\nThe estate is now owned by a trust tied to husband and wife David and April Tausik, according to the deed on the property.\nThe eight-bed, 11-bath home spans over 11,000 square feet on a 3.3-acre lot that keeps it hidden from view of the street and visitors to the nearby Hotel Bel-Air.\nThe property includes a mother-in-law apartment with its own entrance, a primary suite with a laundry chute and safe in the closet, library, bar, air filtration system, solar panels and Tesla Powerwalls. Outside, there\u2019s a tennis court, pool, outdoor kitchen, fruit orchard, paths for hiking and chicken coop.\n",

A second building depends on securing more power. The project could generate over $3 million in annual property taxes, with no added load on school districts, Whitaker said.\nBut some city officials are tapping the brakes over concerns about electricity and water consumption, which have become flashpoints as suburbs from Hoffman Estates to Aurora court similar projects. Karis countered that water use will be lower than that of the previous 600,000-square-foot office building, which was demolished in 2023, and that Naperville\u2019s grid can handle the first building.\n\nThe city council greenlit a $42,000 electric load study, funded by Karis.\nThe data center project would also include Class A office space for 70 on-site employees. The office square-footage wasn\u2019t reported.\nThe development follows a regional trend, as former suburban corporate campuses are repurposed for data centers, as municipalities adapt to declining demand for office space by allowing large properties to be redeveloped for industrial uses.\nThat includes the 2.4 million-square-foot former Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, which is being demolished to make way for a data center project by Compass Datacenters.\nElk Grove Village has already emerged as a significant Chicagoland data center market, and Hoffman Estates is following suit, with big names like Microsoft receiving approval for data center facilities in the area.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Bexar County would contribute 25 percent of the cost of the new arena and no more than $311 million to the project.\nSpurs Sports and Entertainment Chairman and Managing Partner Peter J.

        "content": "The dropoff in demand for industrial space in the Inland Empire has left some landlords scrambling.\nTenants in the I.E., the Western U.S.\u2019 most active warehouse and logistics hub, have vacated 4 million square feet more than they moved into in the second quarter, according to\nCoStar\n. That marks one of the biggest quarterly occupancy losses of any industrial market in the country last quarter.\nAs it stands, the I.E.\u2019s industrial vacancy rate is at a 15-year high of 8.5 percent, according to CoStar, above the nationwide industrial vacancy rate of 7.5 last quarter.\nIn response, landlords have begun offering rent concessions and focusing on lease renewals and marketing attractive top-tier properties.\nThe sharp increase in vacancy \u201cpresents an interesting dilemma for landlords,\u201d Monique Snowden, vice president of asset management at CapRock Partners, told CoStar. CapRock owns 35 industrial properties in the region. Some landlords could consider \u201celevated tenant credit risk\u201d to fill space while others could negotiate cheaper rents when renewing existing tenants\u2019 leases, Snowden said.\nIt\u2019\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the I.E. industrial sector, though.\n\nDedeaux Properties, which owns and manages 14 million square feet in the region, recently locked down a full 165,000-square-foot warehouse lease in Fontana with logistics firm Pilot Air Freight. Last week, IDC Logistics\nleased nearly 1 million square feet\nin one of the I.E.\u2019s largest industrial leases of the year so far.\n\u201cWe recognize we\u2019re in a slow leasing environment,\u201d Alex Filler, senior director of investments at Dedeaux, said. \u201cBut even with all the macro items in the background, we were able to lease at market rates and get really-good-credit tenants into our buildings.\u201d He added that hesitant tenants are \u201cwaiting on interest rates, watching consumer spending and tariffs.\u201d\nAn increase in warehouse and logistics facility construction during the pandemic could be to blame for the current lack of demand to fill the space.\n\u201cMuch of the current rise in vacancies is a correction from the pandemic-era demand surge and record-breaking construction deliveries,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cThis cycle will take time to work through, but I have no doubts about the resilience in the Inland Empire.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The rental market in San Francisco has almost entirely recovered from its pandemic losses.\nMedian rental prices for two-bedroom apartments in San Francisco have surpassed levels before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak, which led to a price dropoff in 2020 and stagnant recovery in the following four years, according to data from\nZumper\ncited by the\nSan Francisco Examiner\n.\nIn July, two-bedrooms in the city rose to a monthly median listing price of $4,780, the highest such level since August 2019. Median rents for one-bedrooms, meanwhile, have almost completely recovered at $3,400, just under the pre-pandemic level of $3,500.\nAn influx of new tech workers, likely driven by the proliferation of\nartificial intelligence company offices\nin the city,\nplayed a key part\nin the recent increase, according to Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen.\n\u201cWith high-earning renters competing for limited inventory, especially near job centers, rent growth is accelerating and showing few signs of slowing in the near term,\u201d Chen told the Examiner.\nIncreasing return-to-office rates could also play a role in more workers needing housing in San Francisco, according to the Examiner. Earlier this year, the city\nclawed its way out of last place\nin return-to-office rates across the country.\n\nHigher-end apartments in the city\u2019s most desirable neighborhoods have seen the greatest price increases.\n\u201cMission Bay, [South of Market], Hayes Valley and Civic Center all saw rents grow in the double digits annually,\u201d Chen said. \u201cDemand in these pockets has risen so much because they are near where offices are typically located, close to the city\u2019s downtown area.\u201d\nRental rates in San Francisco bottomed out in 2020 in the months after nationwide Covid-related shutdowns. Between February 2020 and 2021, median rents for two-bedroom apartments tumbled 24 percent.\n\u201c2020 was an absolute disaster,\u201d Inna Rubinchik, a San Francisco-based leasing agent with Compass who specializes in the luxury rental market, told the Examiner. \u201cPeople had left, and there was so much vacancy.\u201d\nThat, in turn, has made it easy for landlords to find tenants willing to pay whatever price necessary to get the keys to an apartment. \u201cThose properties, you can ask for anything at this point,\u201d Rubinchik said. \u201cYou could just pull the number out of the blue sky, and you will get it.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Sussman and Laurel Sussman last fall for $8.3 million, property records show. On Friday, the estate sold the second unit, penthouse 5102, to an undisclosed buyer for $9.5 million. The two sales total $17.8 million.\nIn April 2021, Minerd, who was chief investment officer of the New York and Chicago-based global investment giant,\npaid $12.5 million\nfor the two units. Together they would total 22,547 square feet, including 16,312 square feet of interior space, and have two swimming pools and 12 parking spaces.\n\nThe developer,\nTwo Roads Development\n, sold the condos at the time. The 51-story, 391-unit bayfront\nBiscayne Beach\nwas completed in 2017.\nThe condos were part of Minerd\u2019s fortune, which was estimated at $400 million around the time of his late 2022 death, the result of a heart attack while working out, according to the\nNew York Times\n. His sudden death at age 63 ignited a fight over his estate. Minerd was married to actor and producer Eloy Mendez.\nBill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bill and Bryan Team brokered the 2021 purchase, and also listed the units for Minerd\u2019s estate.

        "content": "An investor who has made Chicago multifamily deals with embattled real estate attorney Mark Nussbaum is at risk of losing a chunk of his portfolio to financial distress.\nNew York-based Eliazer Tauber, a landlord of dozens of small to midsize apartment complexes on Chicago\u2019s South Side, operated by Straightline Management, is facing at least nine foreclosure lawsuits on buildings that he purchased for far more than the appraised values set by property tax officials.\nThe Straightline portfolio includes hundreds of Chicago apartments, many of which Nussbaum and Tauber appear to have purchased together, sometimes at prices that make little sense, given the need for major renovations and construction work on the properties.\nWhile Nussbaum has served real estate clients as a lawyer, he also became a fast-acting lender to help multifamily buyers show they had funds to close transactions. Some of his clients, however, got their real estate businesses caught up in a mortgage fraud scheme that involved selling properties between related parties in order to score bigger loans, often for more than what the collateral was worth.\nNussbaum then began buying Chicago apartment buildings that were in rough shape as a white knight, saving the previous owners from facing foreclosures or city building code violation cases.\nNow, financial distress is engulfing Tauber, a fellow landlord with whom Nussbaum appeared to work closely. Tauber has signed multiple loans on behalf of Nussbaum\u2019s entities. He and his son Jacob Tauber were Nussbaum\u2019s known deal partners on Chicago multifamily properties through Straightline, according to people familiar with the investors.\nThe foreclosures on Tauber come as Nussbaum is under indictment in New York for grand larceny for allegedly bilking investors out of at least $15 million in escrow deposits meant for real estate deals.\nNussbaum hasn\u2019t been directly tied to the ownership for Tauber\u2019s apartment buildings now facing foreclosure. But he looks to have been a key part of investments for South Side multifamily players now on the brink of financial danger, including Tauber and Yissocher \u201cIzzy\u201d Rotenberg, who sold multiple buildings to Tauber before a big portion of Rotenberg\u2019s 500-unit Chicago portfolio got dragged into foreclosure.\nClose looks at their deals show the wave of distress that could be coming for other investors in the South Side linked to Nussbaum. Many appear to follow a similar playbook of buying properties at low prices, flipping them to related parties at high prices and taking on bigger and bigger loans. This strategy is coming crashing down just as Nussbaum\u2019s many escrow clients are seeking to get repaid.\nThe foreclosure cases totaling 29 units are now hitting Tauber, who bought the properties for nearly $5 million total between December 2023 and May 2024.\nTauber borrowed nearly $4 million from New York-based Ark Mortgage to complete the purchases, and the loans often came at interest rates of more than 8 percent for the borrower. He\u2019s been involved in the purchase of larger buildings with Nussbaum-led entities that employ Straightline Management as their operator, as well.\nSilver Hill Capital, based in Coral Gables, Florida, as well as Wilmington Trust acquired the mortgage notes originated by Ark and are now moving to foreclose on Tauber\u2019s property.\nAttorneys for Nussbaum and the lenders didn\u2019t return requests for comment, and neither did Jacob Tauber nor Straightline.\nThe Chicago Housing Authority last year suspended Straightline from its housing choice voucher program, meaning it wasn\u2019t allowed to make new leases with tenants whose rents are mostly subsidized by the federal government for at least a year, according to public records obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. Suspensions are most commonly triggered by a landlord having multiple units fail the CHA\u2019s Housing Quality Standards, meant to keep apartments from falling into disrepair. Unit failures can allow tenant leases to be terminated early.\n\nStraightline was one of more than 200 companies currently debarred from the program as of May, and Straightline was required to serve a one-year suspension that was scheduled to end earlier this summer. To lift the suspension, Straightline was required to attend a property management course with an approved trainer and gain a certificate of completion; it\u2019s unclear whether Straightline has been reinstated to the authority\u2019s housing assistance program.\nWhile the authority\u2019s landlord guide says suspensions aren\u2019t common, several owners have been suspended for various reasons in recent years, including for failing to get units into compliance within the Housing Choice Voucher program\u2019s housing quality standards requirements.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Tauber\u2019s apartments now in foreclosure were subject to the suspension \u2014 some landlords are able to protect certain portions of their portfolios from Chicago Housing Authority enforcement by using separate vendor numbers issued by the agency for each building, officials said. \u201cIf the vendor uses multiple vendor IDs, CHA\u2019s treatment would vary on a case-by-case basis,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency said.\nStraightline listed 97 units owned and 47 occupied through the CHA program. It\u2019s unknown whether Straightline, Tauber or Nussnaum has additional CHA vendor IDs that have avoided suspensions.\nHere are the properties where Tauber is facing foreclosure from Silver Hill and Wilmington:\n9130 South Throop Street\n8017 South Hermitage Avenue\n5226 South Paulina Street\n8052 South Langley Avenue\n8047 South Vernon Avenue\n5621 South Green Street\n7944 South Eberhart Avenue\n7938 South Langley Avenue\n7937 South Eberhart Avenue\n",

        "content": "Another planned office development in the Bay Area is pivoting to housing as demand for office space lags.\nVancouver, Canada-based developer Westbank has revised its plans for a development in downtown San Jose,\nThe Mercury News\nreported. The new proposal, submitted to the city\u2019s Planning Department, calls for 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development.\nThe housing would rise next to The Tech Interactive museum on a site previously set aside for an office tower. The plan is the latest iteration of proposals from Westbank over the past year that call for the construction of apartments and a data center in downtown San Jose.\n\u201cOur entire San Jose initiative is based on the premise that the best placement for housing is in central urban locations that are walkable and offer proximity to amenities, transit and workplaces,\u201d Andrew Jacobson, vice president of the U.S. for Westbank, told The Mercury News. \u201cPark Habitat aligns perfectly with that strategy\u2026 We\u2019re building on the idea that great cities don\u2019t have business districts or residential districts; rather they are all intermixed.\u201d\nWith the increased strain on the power grid that\nartificial intelligence\nand other new technologies bring, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is looking to\nupgrade\nits electricity systems in San Jose and other parts of the Bay Area. Westbank\u2019s data center would\ncapture the waste heat\nfrom the facility to provide low-cost, low-carbon energy to nearby residents, Jacobson said.\n\nElsewhere in San Jose, last August, Westbank swapped out an approved plan for a 14-story office building at 255 West Julian Street in downtown San Jose for an\n18-story residential tower\n. Soon thereafter, it revised plans submitted in 2022 to switch from a\n750,000-square-foot tower\nat 35 South 2nd Street with 194 apartments and 368,000 square feet of offices to 768 housing units and 10,700 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nOther Bay Area projects to replace offices with housing include a planned\nredevelopment at Bishop Ranch\nin San Ramon, a\nTrammell Crow-led project\nin Walnut Creek, and Align Real Estate\u2019s plans to\nturn offices into homes in Livermore\n.\nOffice vacancy in downtown San Jose was 28.9 percent in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Q2\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Businessman and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso is coming to the aid of\nLos Angeles wildfire\nvictims with a new Small Business Initiative.\nCaruso\u2019s\nSteadfast L.A.\nnonprofit announced the effort to financially help retailers, restaurants and other independent businesses in Altadena, Malibu and the Pacific Palisades impacted by the Eaton and Palisades fires, according to a\npress release\n.\nBanc of California is supporting the endeavor with a $1 million donation from its Wildfire Relief &amp; Recovery Fund. Steadfast L.A. will provide additional financial support and is soliciting more donations. Business owners affected by the fires will be able to receive direct grants of up to $50,000 to assist in rebuilding efforts, per\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n.\nCaruso, who owns several mall properties in the Los Angeles area, spoke about the importance of small businesses when revealing the initiative, noting that they account for more than 90 percent of all businesses in Los Angeles County.\n\u201cThese small businesses were about much more than commercial or economic activity. They were local hallmarks that gave neighborhoods their soul and fostered a sense of community,\u201d Caruso said, per the press release. \u201cWe cannot abandon them. This is about ensuring they have the tools, resources and support they need to come back.\u201d\n\nCaruso said he also hopes that the initiative will send \u201ca broader signal that not only are these local institutions going to reopen, but these communities as a whole have a bright and optimistic future ahead.\u201d\n\u201cThese businesses aren\u2019t faceless storefronts. They are the fabric of the community,\u201d Caruso added. \u201cThey are made up of people: owners, employees and loyal customers. They deserve an advocate to help address the challenges they\u2019re facing through no fault of their own. Through this initiative, they\u2019ll have one.\u201d\nSince January\u2019s deadly wildfires, Caruso has been working to assist small business owners with recovery. In May, he confirmed his charred\nPalisades Village\nshopping center at the heart of the Palisades fire burn zone is slated for reopening next year. Displaced businesses in the Palisades Village area like fashion designer Alice Walker\u2019s boutique are gearing up to open up shop at the mall.\nSmall businesses looking to receive a grant from Steadfast L.A.\u2019s initiative can submit information on the nonprofit\u2019s website. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis with grant recipients being announced shortly thereafter.\nIn addition to the new initiative, Steadfast L.A. has come to the rescue of wildfire-affected residents with\npre-fabricated homes\nand\nartificial intelligence software\ndesigned to expedite rebuilding.\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration closed two investigations by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into the city of Chicago\u2019s zoning practices, a move that likely will end recent efforts to reform the informal practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nLocal housing advocates had hoped the federal investigations would lead to reforming or ending aldermen\u2019s control over zoning in their respective wards. The investigations stemmed from a 2018 lawsuit that alleged such control led to racial segregation and dampened affordable housing development in wealthy, predominately white neighborhoods, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nCity Council members from white neighborhoods have historically resisted racially integrated public housing since the 1930s, the 2018\ncomplaint said\n. Developers still rely heavily on blessings by local aldermen to secure zoning changes and city subsidies for affordable projects, a system critics say reinforces segregation.\nThe city had already entered a voluntary agreement to negotiate a resolution after federal housing authorities found merit in the claims. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s administration was reportedly near an agreement at the end of last year, but negotiations tapered off after Trump took office.\nIt is unprecedented for HUD to walk away from enforcing the Fair Housing Act, said Patricia Fron, executive director at the Chicago Area Fair Housing Alliance.\n\nThe lawsuit and investigation \u201cdemonstrated that decades of discriminatory decision-making have led to the loss of affordable housing in Chicago,\u201d Fron told the outlet. \u201cSo the fact that HUD is now retracting this, when we rely on HUD to enforce these protections, is really a gut punch for us and for the people who have been harmed.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s office disagreed with the decision and said it will\u00a0 work with allies to push for \u201creforms that make it easier to build and maintain affordable housing across our city.\u201d\nHousing advocates worry, however, that more comprehensive measures are unlikely to move forward without the leverage of federal oversight.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

The company produces thin electronic components used in semiconductors called wafers.\nAlso in Sherman, Apple is planning a multiyear agreement with Coherent, a company that produces the laser-emitting components for Face ID use in Apple products. Apple also plans another agreement in North Texas with Dallas-based Texas Instruments.\n\nSherman is expected to become North Texas\u2019 next real estate\nboom town\namid Texas Instruments\u2019 plans for a $30 million semiconductor there.\nApple is building a second office campus in Austin to develop partnerships with Applied Materials and Samsung. Samsung has two semiconductor campuses in the Austin area. Apple is also building a 250,000-square-foot server factory in Houston.\nApple previously struck a $500 million deal with MP Materials Corporation, a producer of rare-earth materials that will result in a neodymium magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth for Apple products.\n\u201cOur products are designed here. We are hiring and growing here. And we support 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers and partners in all 50 states,\u201d said Apple CEO Tim Cook alongside President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\nThe announcements come as Trump applies pressure to tech and other industries to bring back more domestic manufacturing away from international supply chains or risk tariffs on their products.

        "content": "In order to secure crucial City Council approvals, Northwell Health just scaled down its proposed rezoning of an Upper East Side block needed to expand Lenox Hill Hospital.\nNorthwell on Wednesday agreed to reduce the size of an originally proposed 436-foot tower to 370 feet, leading the proposal to unanimously pass the Council\u2019s land use committee and zoning subcommittee. This reduction followed community complaints about the size of the building and timeline of construction,\nCrain\u2019s New York\nreported.\nThe project will include 475 single-bed rooms, expand the emergency room and build a mother-baby unit. Additionally, the new proposal will require eight years of construction, shaving a year off the original timeline.\nLenox Hill\u2019s current campus spans an entire city block from Park to Lexington Avenue, between 76th and 77th streets, with some of the facilities dating back to the 19th century.\nThe hospital has spent\nfive years\nin a standoff with a local community group that pushed back against the $2 billion\nredevelopment\n. The size reduction of the medical tower is the latest in a series of reductions that lowered the scale of the project; it was originally supposed to be 516 feet tall and include a now-scrapped residential tower.\n\nAlthough the plans have been revised to scale down the size and adjust the construction schedule, Valerie Mason, chair of Manhattan Community Board 8, told Crain\u2019s that \u201cwe remain extremely disappointed with the overall height and mass of the building,\u201d adding that the board will continue efforts to further shrink the project.\n\u201cLet there be no confusion, this process is difficult,\u201d said Upper East Side Council member\nKeith Powers\n, pointing to the back-and-forth with the local community. But he added that it was imperative to invest in Lenox Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand in Manhattan what it looks like when we lose our hospitals,\u201d Powers said, likely referring to Mount Sinai\u2019s closure of Beth Israel Hospital.\nThe vote marks one of the last steps Northwell must clear to secure city approval for the redevelopment of its flagship Manhattan hospital. The full City Council is expected to vote on the project next week, followed by a review from the mayor.\n\u2014\nQuinn Waller\n",

The buyer was Timothy Bumb, CEO of Bay 101 cardroom operator Sutter\u2019s Place, while the seller was his brother, Brian Bumb, of S.J. Bayshore Development. Timothy Bumb is also an executive at S.J. Bayshore.\nThe $70 million-plus transaction was only for the property and doesn\u2019t affect the casino\u2019s operations, as ownership and management will remain in place, per SiliconValley.com.\nThe purchase price was 88.2 percent above the property\u2019s $38.3 million assessed value in January 2024, according to SiliconValley.com. To finance the purchase, Sutter\u2019s Place obtained a $65 million loan from Western Alliance Bank.\nDocumentary transfer taxes for the transaction include about $78,900 for Santa Clara County taxes, about $236,700 in city of San Jose taxes, and approximately $1.1 million for San Jose\u2019s Measure E real estate transfer tax, according to the deed.\n\nLast year, Sutter\u2019s Place, doing business as Bay 101, was involved in a legal spat with S.J. Bayshore Development, the landlord of the casino property, over Sutter Place\u2019s future ability to purchase the property, according to law firm\nCoblentz Patch Duffy &amp; Bass\n, which represented Bay 101.\nSutter\u2019s Place sued S.J. Bayshore for breaching the parties\u2019 lease agreement. In the suit, Bay 101 claims that S.J. Bayshore refused to choose an appraiser or conduct an appraisal of the property on which the cardroom is located, thereby delaying Bay 101\u2019s ability to exercise the option and buy the property.\nBay 101 was allegedly seeking $54 million in damages. Ultimately, a Santa Clara Superior Court jury awarded $14.2 million in damages to Bay 101 and declared that S.J. Bayshore wasn\u2019t entitled to any recovery on any of its claims of fraudulent concealment.\nIn addition to the Bay 101 casino, the Bumb family owns the flea market property at 1590 Berryessa Road near the Berryessa BART station. There are plans to potentially redevelop the site into a mixed-use property primarily consisting of housing, though construction has yet to begin.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Texas municipalities are working to fend off a state law that overrides local approvals by allowing residential redevelopment by right in nonresidential zones.\nThe city of Arlington is proposing roadblocks to the legislation, including increasing minimum parking requirements, creating minimum balcony requirements for apartments, mandating electric vehicle charging capabilities, and requiring a minimum of six stories for all developments fronting major thoroughfares.\nSenate Bill 840\ntakes effect Sept. 1, requiring cities to allow mixed-use residential and multifamily development in a zoning classification that allows office, retail or industrial development.\nCity planners presented the Arlington City Council with amendments to the city\u2019s code this week.\n\u201cIt is very obvious that all these additional requirements \u2014 which, by the way, are not required for other projects not under SB 840 \u2014 are very flagrantly targeting missing-middle housing,\u201d said Nicole Nosek, a\nYIMBY organizer\nwho lobbied for the law.\nFor example, under the current code, all multifamily projects need two of six possible amenities. However, for resi conversions with more than 80 units, a swimming pool and shaded children\u2019s play area would be mandatory, with no other options, under the proposed amendments.\n\nArlington isn\u2019t alone. Cities around Texas are trying to stump developers hoping to carry out resi redevelopment under SB 840, according to Dallas-based land attorney Misty Ventura.\nCities are \u201clooking for ways to avoid compliance with state law. And the regulation I see Arlington and other cities focusing most of their effort on is minimums rather than maximums,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cFrisco and others will follow the same playbook.\u201d\nIrving and Plano are weighing similar measures, Nosek and Ventura said.\nThe six-story minimum rule would require steel frames, presenting a considerable cost to resi conversions of stick-frame structures, Ventura said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not being coy about it. They say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this in response to changes in state law, and we need to get it in place before Sept. 1.\u2019 They\u2019re blatantly trying to navigate their way around state law,\u201d she said.Texas lawmakers passed several measures alongside SB 840 to address a projected\nhousing shortage\n, measured at more than 300,000 homes, according to housing advocacy group Up for Growth.\n",

        "content": "K5 Equities added two Stamford apartment complexes to its portfolio in a $57.2 million deal.\nThe White Plains-based private equity real estate firm acquired Daycroft Apartments and Hamilton Gardens from Brooklyn\u2019s Hamilton Daycroft LLC, according to\nWestfair Communications\n. The firm paid $33.2 million for Daycroft and $24 million for Hamilton Gardens, both of which were appraised last year below the sale prices.\nThe deal for the combined properties breaks down to $304,000 per unit.\nThe seller behind the shell company is Ahron Rudich, principal of Empire Realty USA, according to the\nHartford Business Journal\n. Rudich faced pressure from residents to improve conditions at another Connecticut community he allegedly neglected, according to\nCT Insider\nreporting from last year.\nDaycroft, at 44-150 Blachley Road, spans eight buildings with 108 units across 104,000 square feet. Hamilton Gardens, at 333 Hamilton Avenue, includes four buildings with 80 units and 77,000 square feet. The properties were appraised at $23.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively, last year.\n\nK5 is led by Steve Kessner and his son Michael. The elder Kessner, a Bronx native, bought his first building in Manhattan in 1980 and amassed a 48-building portfolio he sold for $225 million in 2007. The firm has acquired nearly $400 million worth of commercial real estate assets in the New York metro, with a focus on value-add and repositioning strategies. The Stamford acquisitions fit that model, though K5 has not yet disclosed any plans for upgrades or redevelopment.\nThe deal adds 188 units to the firm\u2019s holdings and marks a continued push into suburban multifamily properties within its geographic footprint.\nRents have been soaring in Stamford and vacancy rates have remained below the national average. At the halfway point of the year, rents had increased for eight consecutive months in the city, according to\nCoStar\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Tao Group Hospitality and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group have dissolved their hospitality joint venture that planned a restaurant and private club at the 830 Brickell office tower in Miami,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nIn December, Miami-based OKO announced its\nMiami Members Hospitality joint venture\nwith Tao, stating the partnership\u2019s first venue would be a Mediterranean restaurant and club with a members-only lounge expected to open this year on the top two floors of the 830 Brickell office tower. In a news release at the time, Doronin said OKO and Tao \u201cwill craft an elevated experience that resonates with the district\u2019s dynamic spirit and sets a new standard for the city and beyond.\u201d\nAt some point after the announcement, the joint venture was dissolved, sources told\nTRD\n. OKO still plans to open a restaurant and lounge at 830 Brickell\u2019s top two floors, another source said.\nTao Group confirmed that the firm and OKO \u201cagreed to mutually part ways.\u201d OKO declined to comment.\nMiami-based OKO and London-based Cain International completed the 55-story\n830 Brickell\nlast fall at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year\ncompletion delay\n. It\u2019s the first new standalone office tower in the\nBrickell Financial District\nin over a decade.\n\nThe fully leased tower was under construction during the pandemic-induced influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, leading to a preleasing bonanza at 830 Brickell. Tenants include wealth manager\nCorient\n, private equity firm\nThoma Bravo\n, law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Brazilian bank\nBanco Master\n, and Ken Griffin\u2019s\nCitadel and Citadel Securities\n.\nOver the past two years, new-to-market companies slowed their South Florida expansions, with some pulling the plug on planned offices. Financial services firm\nRothschild &amp; Co\n, which had leased 5,000 square feet at 830 Brickell in 2023, opted out of opening a Miami office. Law firm\nWinston &amp; Strawn,\nwhich also had preleased at 830 Brickell, opened an office at Southeast Financial Center in downtown Miami instead, citing the 830 Brickell construction delays.\nElsewhere in Miami, OKO and Cain are developing the 47-story, 135-unit Una Residences condo tower at 175 Southeast 25th Road in Brickell, and completed the 57-story, 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater.\nTao Group, led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, has a portfolio of restaurants, nightlife and daylife venues around the world. In South Florida, Tao has the Hakkasan Miami restaurant at Fontainebleau Miami Beach and, in partnership with Groot Hospitality, opened Casadonna restaurant in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Tao is a subsidiary of Nicosia, Cyprus-based Mohari Hospitality.\nLast summer, OKO and Cain scored a\n$565 million\npermanent loan from Tyko Capital for 830 Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Lennar and its partners dusted off a three-year-old proposal for a megaproject on a 960-acre land tract outside of Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary.\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar and South Florida\u2019s Easton real estate family want to develop City Park with 7,800 for-sale and for-rent homes; 1.4 million square feet of commercial space; and 249 acres of open space, according to a pre-application they submitted to the county late last month. The site is between Southwest 136th and Southwest 152nd streets, and between Southwest 162nd and Krome avenues, near the Country Walk neighborhood in unincorporated Miami-Dade.\nDallas, Texas-based homebuilder Bill Albers also is partnering on the project, according to Ed Easton, the Easton family\u2019s patriarch and founder of Miami-based\nEaston Group\n.\nThe site consists of 11 lots primarily owned by Lennar, the Eastons, the Dallas investor and the Cheng family, according to records and Easton. Freight rail company CSX Transportation owns two lots. John C. Cheng Escartin is managing partner and international consultant for Panamanian tax, assurance and professional services firm HLB International, according to records. It has not been decided whether the Chengs will partner on the project or sell their properties to the developers, Easton said.\nA\nUDB\nexpansion is one of the most controversial proposals a developer can file in Miami-Dade, often drawing opposition from environmentalists and others seeking to stop suburban sprawl. Opponents often decry UDB expansions as development encroachment onto wetlands, open land that could be needed for preservation of Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, and farmland needed to meet the demand for produce.\nUDB\nexpansions require a super-majority vote by county commissioners, and often also face a mayor\u2019s veto and lawsuits.\nLennar and the Eastons first proposed City Park in 2022 and backed out of pursuing the project at the time.\n\n\u201cWe decided in the middle of it that it was not a good time to do it,\u201d Easton said, \u201cbecause we thought the housing market wasn\u2019t as much in need of something like this as it is today.\u201d\nSince then, South Florida\u2019s housing demand has grown, necessitating projects such as the City Park UDB expansion, Easton said, adding that Miami-Dade also struggles with a lack of developable land. Also, he said the City Park land has no environmental significance.\n\u201cSensible development on non-environmentally sensitive land like this one makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a need for more land for sensible development in Miami. This particular parcel does not have any environmental sensitivities.\u201d\nThe 2022 City Park concept book attached to the recent application depicts a somewhat self-supporting mixed-use development with its own schools, offices, retail and entertainment venues such as a lagoon or water park. The project would include the Village Core district with restaurants and entertainment, as well as a 10-acre farm.\nThe residences will include single-family homes, townhomes and apartments, according to the application. The project will include below-market rate homes, Easton said.\nThe developers are in the very first inning of the approval process, which could take until late next year or early 2027 to reach a final vote by commissioners, he said.\nThe last major proposal for UDB expansion was Coral Rock and Aligned Real Estate\u2019s South Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District on 379 acres. The developers won commission approval after five public hearings and survived Mayor Daniella Levine Cava\u2019s veto in 2022, but lost in court when a judge determined last year the county had\nmissed an approval deadline\n.\nLast month, a group of landowners, through their Herkoz and Alflo Sunset affiliates, proposed a\n64.8-acre UDB expansion\nfor a project with 1,200 single-family homes and apartments, and up to 90,000 square feet of retail. The site is on the northwest corner of Southwest 137th Avenue and Southwest 248th Street.\n",

The project is in the Logistics Campus, which is Dermody\u2019s redevelopment of the former Allstate headquarters at 3075 Sanders Road.\nDermody bought the 232-acre site for $232 million\nin 2022\n, with plans to build one of the largest urban logistics developments in the U.S. The 10-building, 3.2 million-square-foot complex will amount to a $500 million project, but finding tenants is taking some time.\nThe Pepsi facility is being built at the far southern end of the campus in the second phase of the development. The five-building first phase is mostly\nvacant\n. Four of those five buildings comprise 700,000 square feet up for lease.\nDental equipment manufacturer HuFriedyGroup leased one of the buildings, spanning 326,300 square feet, in March, though a target date for moving in has not been determined.\n\nThat lease followed an earlier agreement with California-based Upside Foods, which planned to build but then\npostponed\na 187,000-square-foot cultivated-meat facility at the campus, choosing to focus on its California operations instead.\nThe vacancy rate in greater Chicago\u2019s industrial market crept up 6.3 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, and construction was down 24 percent, according to Avison Young. The Pepsi warehouse is the only industrial project in development in Cook County, and its lease begins in February.\nOffice-to-industrial redevelopment, especially for data centers, is becoming a trend in the Chicago suburbs. Karis Critical, for example, is planning a\ntwo-building data-center complex\non the site of the former Alcatel\u2011Lucent office site in Naperville.\nAnd Compass Datacenters is redeveloping the 2.4 million-square-foot former Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates into a data-center complex.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

They sold the 2.3-acre home at 5940 North Bay Road\nfor $105 million\n.\nProperty records show an LLC managed by investment firm executive Nobel Gulati and his wife, Ruchi, sold the Manalapan property to\nKahn\nand his wife, Suzanne Passi Kahn.\nThe 18,000-square-foot house was built in 1997. The ocean-to-lake property includes a tennis court, boat dock and an oceanfront pool and spa. It has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and three half-bathrooms.\n\nThe sellers listed the property in February 2024 for just under $40 million, and it was most recently\nasking $33 million\n.

        "content": "Recent filings indicate that Trader Joe\u2019s is planning to bring commercial life to an Uptown retail site that\u2019s been a graveyard for food businesses lately.\nThe Southern California-based retail chain has applied for a package-goods liquor license at 804 West Montrose Avenue, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nAn X account, @minc798, first reported the news of Trader Joe\u2019s application for a liquor license.\nThe space has been vacant since November, when vegan food hall XMarket closed after a run of just more than a year. Two successive plant-based grocery stores preceded XMarket, going back to 2021.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has not confirmed any plans for an Uptown store, telling Block Club the chain is always on the lookout for\npotential locations\nand has been eyeing Chicago, specifically, for new opportunities.\n\nThe chain has six stores in Chicago, ranging from Roscoe Village to Hyde Park, and a dozen or so more in the suburbs.\nThe application for a liquor license suggests more than a passing interest in the Uptown location, and a Trader Joe\u2019s could provide a boost to the area\u2019s retail scene beyond the 6,500-square-foot space, providing an amenity for residents and stirring commerce on Montrose Avenue.\nIndeed, residents of various neighborhoods on the\nFar North Side\nhave publicly pined for a Trader Joe\u2019s, which appeared set for a store in nearby Andersonville before the deal fell through two years ago.\nResidents and business interests in West Ridge tried to sell Trader Joe\u2019s on a location on Western Avenue, a pitch that came in the early days of the pandemic. Trader Joe\u2019s passed on the location, which eventually landed Starbucks as an anchor for a new development.Trader Joe\u2019s is known for its eponymous private-label foods, as well as quirky marketing and relatively\nlow prices\n, given its foodie sensibilities. It operates coast-to-coast, with locations in 42 states.\n",

City staff approved the change because the east side is not the primary facade of the building.\n\nThe measure approving the concept passed the Historic Design and Review Commission without objection, but the panel did set some conditions for Innjoy to address going forward. The developer was encouraged to salvage any brick that is removed during renovations and keep it on-site as a resource for future repairs.\nInnjoy partner Adrian Ramirez previously told the outlet that the residential conversion proved to be the developer\u2019s most compelling option on a conversion.\nInnjoy bought the building in 2020 and considered remaking it into a hotel before settling on a residential plan.\nInnjoy is no stranger to the hotel business. It bought the State National Bank Building in downtown Houston in 2020 and converted it to a Moxy hotel, part of the Marriott stable of brands. That deal set off speculation that the developer would turn the Nix Building into a hotel, but plans submitted to the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission indicate it has stuck with the plan for apartments.\nNo timeline has been set for construction.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s broker fee ban is\nwreaking havoc\non rental data.\nThe number of new rental listings uploaded to local listing services has dropped dramatically since the law, known as the FARE Act,\ntook effect\nin mid-June. The provision prohibits landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired and imposes fines up to $2,000 per violation.\nBetween June 11 and July 31, brokers added just 1,400 rental listings to the Residential Listing Service, Brooklyn MLS and similar agent-facing platforms, compared to 5,300 listings submitted during the same period last year, according to data from UrbanDigs. The total marked a 74 percent decline in new listings year-over-year.\n\u201cThis sharp decline suggests landlords are using other listing sources as they adjust to the new FARE Act requirements,\u201d UrbanDigs\u2019 co-founder John Walkup wrote in a statement.\nThe \u201ccollapse\u201d in rental listings on the RLS comes after a July report from StreetEasy found rental inventory on its platform had held steady in the month after the law\u2019s passage, excluding a temporary drop in listings immediately after the law took effect.\nThe day after the FARE Act\u2019s implementation, more than 1,000 listings\ndisappeared from StreetEasy\n. The company chalked the sudden dip up to those represented by rental agents who did not have an updated compensation agreement in place before the law\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe outflow of listings has since stabilized and followed usual seasonal trends associated with summertime leasing activity,\u201d the report states.\n\nHowever, the platform logged an 8 percent decline in rental inventory across the five boroughs last month compared to July 2024, according to its data dashboard. Manhattan notched the largest drop, with inventory falling more than 11 percent.\n\u201cThe FARE Act curbs brokers\u2019 ability to market nonexclusive listings, leading to a noticeable drop in inventory across platforms,\u201d REBNY\u2019s senior vice president of residential brokerage wrote in a statement. \u201cWith vacancy rates at historic lows, this reduced visibility makes an already competitive market even harder to navigate for everyday New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe Real Estate Board of New York requires its members to submit rental listings to the RLS if they have an exclusive agreement with the landlord.\nUnlike consumer-facing platforms such as StreetEasy and Zillow, the RLS limits who can upload their listings directly to the service, as it is designed to encourage co-broking between agents. The platform does not allow landlords or property managers who are not licensed brokers to submit their units.\nREBNY and others in the industry cautioned that the law could drive rental inventory down, as the provision assumes that brokers have exclusive agreements with landlords, making the landlords responsible for their compensation. Before the law, brokers were able to market listings to tenants without an exclusive agreement with the landlord and collect fees from tenants directly.\nA federal judge has\nrejected multiple bids\nfrom REBNY to halt the FARE Act\u2019s implementation while a lawsuit it filed against the City Council makes its way through the courts. REBNY has alleged that the provision violates the First Amendment.\nSome agents have said the law\u2019s implementation has created chaos. Market analytics firms reported inflated rents in the immediate aftermath of the law, and uncertainty over how to properly comply with the rules.\n\u201cBoy, is it confusing,\u201d said Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. She added that finding accurate data on the rental market was already a tall order, but the fallout from the new law could likely make it worse. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to keep the data now.\u201d\n",

Only floors two through seven of the 24-story building will consist of office space.\nThe conversion is expected to start in 2026.\nSavanna bought the site for\n$28 million\nin 2014. About seven years later, the developer finally nabbed $264 million in construction financing, a major coup at the time given the lack of office demand during Covid. PIMCO provided the senior debt, and CarVal Investors added the mezzanine loan, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\n\nSavanna bet corporate tenants would trickle into Downtown Brooklyn. But since the tower\u2019s completion in 2023, it has remained vacant.\nSavanna defaulted on its senior loan and Joshua Zamir\u2019s Capstone swooped in to purchase the debt from PIMCO and BH3 Management pitched in equity,\nThe Promote\nreported. Capstone initiated a non-judicial\nforeclosure\n. An auction date was set for June. The lender appears to have made a credit bid using its existing debt to acquire the property.\nThe Willoughby Street office building wasn\u2019t Savanna\u2019s only recent loss. Last year, it offloaded\n360 Lexington Avenue\nfor $65 million; it purchased the 270,000-square-foot office and retail property in 2019 for $180 million. Savanna also faced foreclosure last year at\n521 Fifth Avenue,\na 39-story, 460,000-square-foot office tower.\nNow, the firm is down another office building, and the property won\u2019t be solely office space for long.\n\u201c141 Willoughby Street presents a truly unique blank slate upon which to reimagine a newly developed institutional-grade asset,\u201d said Adam Falk of BH3 Management.\n",

        "content": "Capitalism doesn\u2019t work without competition.\nSo it would be nice to see rank-and-file real estate people \u2014 who rightfully\noppose socialism\nfor things markets can do better \u2014 get just as worked up about anti-competitive practices in the industry.\nCredit bureaus are a good example. Three are dominant players: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Instead of promoting competition among them, the government does the opposite.\nWhen a homebuyer applies for a mortgage that will be sold to or backstopped by Fannie and Freddie \u2014 and we\u2019re talking\n70 percent of mortgages\n\u2014 the two government-sponsored entities require that the buyer\u2019s credit history be obtained from all three major credit bureaus.\nBecause of this \u201ctri-merge\u201d policy, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion do not have to compete for that business. The result is higher prices that inflate closing costs for buyers.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association has\nlong called for reforms\n, lamenting in a June blog that \u201cgovernment mandates for a tri-merge report have insulated providers from competitive pressures, allowing them to raise prices with little regard for quality, performance, or innovation.\u201d\nThe Biden administration heeded that call in 2022, proposing two alternatives to tri-merge. One was \u201c\nbi-merge\n\u201d \u2014 requiring a credit score from two of the three major credit bureaus. The other was using the FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 models. Again, two sources.\nThe proposal was never implemented because Joe Biden lost the election a year before its scheduled start date, which the Federal Housing Finance Agency postponed four days before Biden left office. Industry opposition was a factor. As\nsix large mortgage players\nlater told the Trump administration\u2019s FHFA director,\nBill Pulte\n, the plan created \u201csignificant uncertainty, complexity, and multitude of unanswered questions.\u201d\nLast month, Pulte allowed Fannie and Freddie to use VantageScore 4.0 by itself, which will help responsible renters become homeowners because VantageScore takes rent and utility payments into account.\nPulte\nalso ditched the bi-merge plan, leaving tri-merge as the other choice.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association cheered that news, but wants to replace tri-merge with a\nsingle-score option\n: Equifax, Experian\nor\nTransUnion. Using all three was once necessary because their reports varied widely, but their information is far more consistent now, the MBA says. Single-score is working well for auto loans and home equity loans, according to the group.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWoody Pascal, who authored the\ncriteria\nby which a substantially rehabilitated building may be removed from rent stabilization, was\nhired four months ago\nby the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners.\nThe criteria \u2014 as interpreted by the Division of Homes and Community Renewal \u2014 have turned out to be very difficult to meet, trapping\nsome buildings\nin rent stabilization.\n\nBut the NYAA clearly did not blame Pascal. It considers the regulations to be a product of the agency, not of Pascal in particular.\nSend your thoughts on sub rehab and demolition to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The G train, which fully opened in 1937, was the last complete subway line built in New York City. It was originally called the IND Crosstown Line. No subway stations have been built in Brooklyn since 1948, when the A train was extended from Broadway Junction to Euclid Avenue. The\nInterborough Express\n, if built as planned, would end both of those droughts.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A former NYPD lawyer filed a corruption suit against the department and Mayor Eric Adams, alleging she was fired after recommending disciplinary action against the highest-ranking uniformed officer, former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, according to\nGothamist\n. The plaintiff, Amy Litwin, investigated Maddrey following allegations by civilians that he intervened to halt the arrest of a retired officer who threatened teenagers.\n\u2014 Three years into Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s five-year housing plan, the state says it has \u201cbuilt or preserved\u201d 65,000 of the 100,000 promised affordable homes, according to\nCity &amp; State\n.\u00a0 However, according to the official housing plan dashboard, only 47,000 homes are done or in the works. The state attributes this discrepancy to a delay in data collection. New York City has the bulk of the units \u2014 19,000, including 8,000 in Brooklyn.\n\u2014 There\u2019s no official enforcement or oversight of ballot petitions, Gothamist\nreported\n. The outlet looked into fraudulent signatures found on Adams\u2019 petitions and concluded that no city official reviews the signatures. Enforcement is typically done by rival campaigns.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,650-square-foot townhouse at 683 Leonard Street in Greenpoint. The Yuval Vidal Team at Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$12 million\nfor a 35,349-square-foot warehouse at 31-39 39th Street in Sunnyside.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,032-square-foot condominium unit at 36 Bleecker Street in Noho. Tony Sargent at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for an 870,124-square-foot, 22- and 28-story project with 630 total units at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park. Lu Ning Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Jiashu Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

The identity of the buyer wasn\u2019t immediately known.\nSitting on a double-wide lot, the building was purchased with its development rights in mind, one of the sources said.\nNewmark\u2019s Jay Luchs brokered the deal. Michael Shabani, who runs Los Angeles-based investment firm Crown Equity, was involved in the deal. Neither returned requests for comment.\n\nMcNamee, who wasn\u2019t immediately reachable, refinanced the property for $160 million, or $5,691 per square foot, in 2019.\nRodeo Drive \u2014 where rents average $1,000 per square foot per year plus triple net \u2014 has notched some hefty retail investment sales prices in recent years.\nThose include LVMH\u2019s\n$245 million purchase\nof a 22,270-square-foot two-story double lot at 468 North Rodeo Drive (or $11,001 per square foot); hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s\n$200 million sale\nof the 42,560-square-foot 360 North Rodeo Drive that housed his Luxe boutique hotel plus three high-end retail stores (or $4,699 per square foot); LVMH\u2019s\n$110 million acquisition\nof the 6,200-square-foot property at 456 North Rodeo Drive (or $17,742 per square foot); and Shabani\u2019s purchase of two storefronts spanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for\n$112 million\n(or $10,500 per square foot).\nIn Beverly Hills, the 338 North Rodeo Drive deal is believed to mark the second-highest deal for a single property behind Nicholas and Christian Candy\u2019s 2007 $500 million purchase of the former Robinson\u2019s-May department store site.\n",

The submarket\u2019s average rent climbed to $33.07 per-square-foot, outpacing the average suburban Chicago office rent of $27.12 per square foot.\nNo other suburban Chicago submarkets tracked by Transwestern saw rents increase by more than 1.5 percent year-over-year, and rents fell by more than 5 percent in two submarkets.\nEven with O\u2019Hare\u2019s slight advantage, the overall region is in worse shape than it was pre-pandemic.\nIn 2019, the suburban office market\u2019s direct vacancy rate hovered around 15 percent and now sits at 20 percent. The overall vacancy rate, which includes space being marketed, is at 26 percent.\n\nDemand had softened in the suburban markets before the pandemic, but the steep decline in office demand since then accelerated the trend.\nNow, class A offices, landlords with significant tenant-improvement dollars to offer or properties with close proximity to the airport appear to be attracting the few tenants that are looking for space.\nSignificant transactions in the second quarter included a 79,800-square-foot lease signed by the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund for the entire building at 800 Commerce Drive in Oak Brook. The lease did little to improve overall market conditions, however, as the firm is relocating from a 60,000 square-foot space at 2211 York Road, also in Oak Brook.\nJust down the road, Ashley Capital bought an 183,400-square-foot office building at 2001 York Road for $10 million, under $55 per square foot, from Varde Partners. Though the sale was rare for the slow market, it marked a significant decline in value for the property.\nThe building last sold in 2013 for $34 million, or $185 per square foot.",

        "content": "Tubi, the ad-supported streaming service owned by Fox Corporation, is moving its San Francisco headquarters.\nThe free streamer announced today it signed a lease for one floor at the Kilroy Realty-owned 201 3rd Street in South of Market, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. The company will occupy about 31,000 square feet at the property.\nCome fall, Tubi\u2019s 140 Bay Area-based employees will move to the Kilroy building from its similarly sized headquarters across three floors at 315 Montgomery Street in the Financial District. Tubi has been based in those offices since 2017.\n\u201cWe had one primary requirement: a single floor,\u201d Natasha Valani, chief people officer at Tubi, told\nThe San Francisco Standard\nof the new lease. \u201cWhen you bring talented people together in one space, you increase the velocity of collaboration and connection.\u201d\n\nThe company simultaneously announced the launch of its Tubi Builders Program, an 18-month bootcamp \u201cdesigned to develop the next generation of product and engineering leaders.\u201d The program\u2019s inaugural run with a 20-person cohort will coincide with the opening of its new headquarters.\nThe 337,000-square-foot 201 3rd Street building welcomed other new tenants onto its floors earlier this year. In March, data analytics company\nAmplitude\nrecommitted to its nearly 60,000-square-foot lease until 2029. Last quarter, legal artificial intelligence startup Harvey signed a lease for 92,000 square feet at the building.\nThose companies fill a void left by Capital One, which departed the 120,000 square feet it occupied in the building at the end of last year. That loss dragged down the building\u2019s occupancy from 68.2 percent in the third quarter of last year to 25.5 percent by the end of the year, according to the Business Times. As of the second quarter this year, the 12-story building was 52.9 percent leased, per Kilroy.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The lending arm of the Rok family is accusing Miami-based developer Marlon Gomez of delaying the court sale of an Aventura site by allegedly filing frivolous bankruptcy petitions.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based Rok Lending, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, is seeking to immediately reschedule an Aug. 4 foreclosure auction. It was canceled due to Gomez\u2019s entity that owns the 1.6-acre property at\n21291 Northeast 28th Avenue\nfiling for bankruptcy protection, court records show.\nIn February, Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate won a final judgment of $19.9 million against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a\n$15 million\nloan issued in 2023.\nIn an emailed statement, Gomez said his entity and Rok Lending have worked out a resolution. \u201cWe have reached agreement with Rok on a deal that works for both of us,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWe have our refinancing in process, look forward to paying off our loan and restarting an excellent project.\u201d\nRepresentatives and attorneys for Rok Lending did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGomez\u2019s entity filed two Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the past four months in order to stall the court sale of the property, where Gomez is planning a 142,000-square-foot medical office building, according to filings by Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate in Miami-Dade Circuit Court and Miami federal bankruptcy court.\nThe Aventura development site was first scheduled to be sold at an auction on April 22. But Gomez\u2019s entity filed for Chapter 11 protection the day before, which stayed the foreclosure proceedings, court records show. On May 20, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the petition and restricted Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for a period of 180 days, according to filings in bankruptcy court.\nHowever, Gomez\u2019s entity filed a second Chapter 11 petition \u201cjust minutes before the rescheduled [Aug. 4] foreclosure sale,\u201d a Rok Lending motion states. The petition lists assets between $10 million and $50 million and liabilities in the same amounts. Rok Lending alleges that the second bankruptcy petition is void due to the 180-day prohibition.\n\u201cTo be clear, the damage to [Rok Lending\u2019s] interests require emergent relief,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThis property is underwater and every day that [Rok Lending\u2019s] realization on its collateral is delayed results in immediate and irreparable damage.\u201d\nThe Aventura site is not the only property tied to Gomez that is facing foreclosure. A court-appointed receiver is listing a distressed 1.8-acre Miami River development site for\n$18.1 million\nthat is owned by a Gomez-managed entity. Karson &amp; Co and The Porosoff Group, the brokerages marketing the Miami River property, have set an Aug. 20 deadline to receive offers.The site is subject to a pending foreclosure lawsuit filed in March by a lender alleging Gomez\u2019s entity defaulted on a\n$10 million loan\n.",

        "content": "Gary Mkrtichyan said his construction company Opus Builders receives two to three calls per day from prospective wildfire rebuilding clients.\nHe\u2019s got about a dozen\nAltadena homeowners\nhe\u2019s working with but thinks that could easily grow to 20 within the next couple of months. That\u2019s in addition to a mixed-use project with apartments above ground-floor commercial near Palisades Village in Pacific Palisades.\nAs more homeowners make the decision to stay and\nrebuild\n, nailing down a consensus on cost is a bit like herding cats. In other words, a painful exercise with seemingly no point.\nThe construction inflation is real, according to Mkrtichyan who said some of the quotes he hears are coming in wildly beyond reality for his company.\nAn example? The conversation around pricing that\u2019s $700 and above per square foot to rebuild. Mkrtichyan can\u2019t see it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d he said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nThe exception would be maybe adding a basement level, he said.\nMkrtichyan said there\u2019s no client for which Opus Builders is currently charging more than $550 to $600 per square foot at the moment. The company bills itself as a one-stop-shop general contractor specializing in upscale custom homes and commercial projects, which could explain what some might call a low quote.\nOpus has the capacity to handle architecture, design and construction internally, while working with a roster of subcontractors and acting as a project manager on planning, permitting and sourcing of finishes. All of that being overseen by a single touchpoint can in some ways help keep costs in line.\nThe builder walks into what\u2019s become a heated discussion among some. It\u2019s one some might say began in February when The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack posted an\nInstagram video\non rebuilding.\nBelack broke down the challenges developers face in buying burned Palisades lots based on a construction cost of $600 per square foot. When factoring in the cost of the Measure United to House L.A. tax, in addition to commission, escrow, title and other fees, the end result is a loss.\nMeasure ULA, which was a 2022 ballot measure marketed as the Mansion Tax, applies a 4 percent levy on deals starting at $5.3 million. It creeps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more. It\u2019s relevant in the Palisades rebuilding conversation because the community is part of the city of Los Angeles. Eaton Fire properties, if resold, are not subject to the tax because Altadena and Pasadena are not part of the city of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe lesson here is that prohibitive measures like the Mansion Tax continue to discourage builders from building in Los Angeles and, before you vilify the homebuilders, we really need them right now to replace all the homes and communities the fire just took from us,\u201d Belack says in his video. \u201cThe land is for sale because these specific families are unable to rebuild, so unless we allow builders to make a few bucks, which is usually around 20 percent of their investment, Los Angeles remains in a housing crisis.\u201d\n\nMounting headaches\nBelack\u2019s post, as of Thursday, had garnered nearly 29,000 likes and almost 3,000 comments from people launching discussions on land values, zoning, affordable housing in the state, taxes and the subject of costs to rebuild. Central to Belack\u2019s post wasn\u2019t to set off a squeal over who was charging what, but to point out\nMeasure ULA\n\u2019s impediment to rebuilding.\nEven still, it cracked open a discussion around cost that has been eating away at residents since the Jan. 7 fires.\nResults of a\nsurvey\ndone between March 6 and April 11 show\nPalisades\nresidents estimating $800 per square foot for construction, which was culled from 307 respondents. That\u2019s an average based on a range swinging from $400 to over $1,200 a foot.\nThe Urban Land Institute sponsored the survey that was administered by Real Estate Consulting, with endorsements from the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and USC Lusk Center for Real Estate.\nThe Eaton fire data in that same survey draws from a smaller pool of 37 respondents that estimated an average of $580 per square foot in construction costs. The mean was based on a range of $400 to $800 per square foot.\nFor most wildfire victims, budgets are not unlimited. In fact, those on the ground almost universally call out the funding shortfall for rebuilds as a major pain point.\nOpus\u2019 Mkrtichyan is no different, pointing out most in Altadena that he\u2019s working with don\u2019t have sufficient funds to cover rebuilding. Some, he said, applied for relief through the U.S. Small Business Administration in a bid to offset some of the difference. THE SBA offers disaster loans up to $500,000 for the repair or replacement of a primary residence and up to $100,000 for personal property loss. Other clients of Opus Builders paid out of pocket to make up the difference, but those are typically residents that were already doing a remodel and had funds available.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s probably 60-40 between people who have just enough to rebuild and then 40 [percent] are probably ones that don\u2019t have enough or had a lapse in coverage and those people are the ones that are either going towards the SBA or they\u2019re stuck, and they have to sell or figure out some sort of funding,\u201d Mkrtichyan said.\nOnce homeowners push past questions of funding, it\u2019s now navigating\npermitting\n.\nSo far, Opus Builders has six Altadena projects submitted to the county. They\u2019re part of the 1,454 applications received as of Thursday for the unincorporated areas impacted by the Eaton fire, according to Los Angeles County. That\u2019s a jump of over 100 applications since Monday. So far, 172 building permits have been issued.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re overwhelmed,\u201d Mkrtichyan said of the system. \u201cIt\u2019s too much workload and there is a void between submitting and getting a response.\u201d\n",

The Deutsche Bank loan carries a 6.4 percent fixed interest rate, according to Moody\u2019s.\nTo avoid a looming $365 million debt maturity, Metro Loft also brought in additional investors. Sentuy Realty and 60 Guilders bought the property\u2019s mezzanine loan for $80 million and invested an additional $40 million in the building.\nMetro Loft is still an owner of the property, though Berman didn\u2019t disclose what his stake in the building was at this point. In May, it was reported that 60 Guilders and Sentry would\nacquire a combined 50 percent interest\nin the property.\nIn April, the special servicer of a $265 million securitized loan filed a pre-foreclosure action against Metro Loft, which came after a November KBRA report revealing Metro Loft was nearing default on its mortgage.\n\nAfter the pre-foreclosure action was filed, a representative of the developer said it would be \u201cbringing in a new partner to pay off the debt.\u201d The pre-foreclosure case was expected to be dropped when the recap was finalized, though it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s happened yet; Metro Loft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBerman\npaid $450 million\nin 2017 to buy Vanbarton Group out of the rental property. That was three years after Metro Loft purchased a minority stake in the property and two years after the partners launched a $100 million conversion.\nThe 573-unit, 460,000-square-foot conversion opened in 2017. Occupancy is at 98 percent. Amenities include a 1,200-square-foot courtyard and an indoor pool.\nApartments are leasing for an average of $5,000, according to Moody\u2019s, and the building generated $17 million in net operating income last year. The property was valued at $378 million in an appraisal two months ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It\u2019s a great tool for the investors to become U.S. residents. The only downside is it\u2019s a bit slow.\u201d\nHe expects investors from Asia and Latin America, where EB-5 is most popular. (The Trump administration is working on a\ngold card program\nthat will provide citizenship to foreigners who pay about $5 million.)\nStarlife\u2019s construction affiliate is building the Hollywood project, and work began earlier this year, records show. It\u2019s expected to be completed by early 2027. Kobi Karp designed the project.\n\nThe developer secured site plan approval in late 2023. Units will range from 489-square-foot studios to 1,250-square-foot, three-bedroom apartments. Shahbazyan said apartments made the most sense for the site after completing a market analysis.\n\u201cWe believe the rental market is the strongest, highest and best use for this area, especially luxury because there\u2019s not a lot,\u201d he said.\nStarlife has multifamily, mixed-use, hotel and single-family and townhouse developments, mostly in Broward County. Hollywood 21 marks its first in\nHollywood\nand its first EB-5-funded project, Shahbazyan said.\nEarlier this year, developer Louis Birdman and his partners\nadvanced plans\nto build 618 apartments in Hollywood, as part of a mixed-use development on a city-owned brownfield property just west of I-95.\nCalta Group, led by brothers Gaetano and Ignazio Caltagirone, are building a pair of apartment projects in Hollywood totaling 251 rentals. In February, they secured a\n$53.7 million construction loan\nfor Caltopia Hollywood at 2750 Van Buren Street and Caltopia Hollywood II at 2217-2239 Jackson Street.\n",

Plans call for construction to start in September and be completed in the summer of 2026.\nFoundry Commercial keeps its Texas office in the Oak Lawn district of Dallas, about a mile from Old Parkland, where Harlan Crow\u2019s operation keeps its headquarters, surrounded by various family offices and other investment firms on the campus. The developer has been busy in the DFW market and elsewhere in recent years, plying a specialty of office-to-industrial conversions. It now has five properties in DFW, including a project that is underway on several buildings in Plano. It has another five conversions under its belt in various markets around the U.S.\n\nThe latest deal indicates that Foundry Commercial sees continued potential as office markets are ailing in many suburban markets. The strategy is based on what the developer expects to be \u201cstrong demand from logistics and manufacturing users who want to be closer to labor, rooftops, and major transportation corridors,\u201d partner and general manager Jim Traynor told the outlet.\nSupporting the strategy in Irving is limits on industrial zoning amid strong demand for Class A industrial space, which the developer can address with new construction.\nThe developer has retained Holt Lunsford Commercial\u2019s Andrew Gilbert and Keaton Bryce \u2014 the duo behind the recent $43.5 million sale of the Dallas Morning News\u2019 620,000-square-foot printing facility in Plano \u2014 to handle leasing on the latest project in Irving.\n",

        "content": "Local firm Sightwell is pitching an $18 million development on the site of a former lumber yard in the downtown of suburban village East Dundee.\nThe proposed Heritage Station development would center around a performing arts center and feature a mix of retail, apartments and townhomes, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The village purchased the property at 110 Railroad Street, previously the site of Doederlein Lumber, in 2023. The primary stipulation placed on the property by the village board of trustees was that any development include a performing arts center.\nSightwell was the sole developer to submit plans to the village\u2019s request for proposal. The firm pitched an 8,000-square-foot performing arts center consisting of a 4,000-square-foot stage and 2,000-square-foot lobby, flexible seating and classrooms. A second floor would include six apartments and 10 suites of lodging.\nAnother residential component would face Hill Street, adding nine to 12 townhomes with alley garages and front stoops.\nThe performing arts center was proposed as a lease-to-own structure in order to attract nonprofit or other civic organizations to take the helm. Andy Burns, co-founder of Sightwell, said the concept is designed to promote walkability, and decisions on businesses to go in the retail component will complement existing downtown commerce.\n\nOf the three design options proposed, one featuring a clock tower appealed most to the trustees.\nStillwell asked the village to sell the company the site for $10 and contribute $2.5 million in Tax Increment Financing. Another $10 million would come from private investors and $5.5 million from the organization that ends up leasing the performing arts center.\nQuestions remain about the development going forward. Located a little more than a block from the Fox River and located in a flood plain, trustees raised concerns about how that might potentially affect neighboring properties. Sightwell promised to assess those concerns in the engineering process.\nA decision to move forward will come in the coming months after a development agreement is drafted with the village for board approval, potentially lending to construction starting at the end of next year, with a target completion in summer 2028.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The unnamed group bought the debt on the building, which was\nin foreclosure\n, for $42.5 million. The building last sold in 2013 for $95.8 million.\nIt\u2019s MacMahon\u2019s latest buy in a year-long streak of purchases in the Union Square area.\nLast August, an investor group tied to MacMahon bought the four-story building at 225 Post Street from the parent company of former tenant Burberry to the tune of $17.4 million, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. The following month, a MacMahon affiliate bought 11 retail properties across five buildings in Hayes Valley for $10.9 million.\n\u201cMy partners and I are long-term investors, and we believe San Francisco in the long-term is a great market for investing in real estate,\u201d MacMahon told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of the Hayes Valley buys. \u201cWe have made a number of investments in retail in the past so we are very comfortable with the asset class.\u201d\n\nMacMahon made both of those purchases through a different partnership group and not his Moran Capital company, where he\u2019s a principal.\nUnion Square is shaping up to be an attractive area for out-of-town investors looking to grab commercial properties at bargain-basement prices.\nIan Jacobs\n, an heir of the Reichmann real estate dynasty, has been on a buying spree in the neighborhood in recent months.\nIt started in April when Jacobs purchased an Art Deco building at 200-216 Powell Street for $7.4 million, according to the\nBusiness Times\n. The following month, the former Warren Buffett prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Berkshire Hathaway investment researcher bought\n111 Ellis Street\n, a five-story, 21,412-square-foot building, for an undisclosed amount that was significantly lower than its pre-pandemic value, according to\nThe San Francisco Standard\n.

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo has engaged in a high-stakes arbitration dispute with Bayerische Versorgungskammer, the German pension fund that has backed many of his high-profile U.S. projects.\nShvo has filed a claim through the private Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees, including $27 million in payments tied to specific properties and $21 million in carried interest from the Transamerica Pyramid project in San Francisco,\nBisnow reported\n.\nBVK said in a statement it is \u201cnot unusual to seek a separation, possibly prematurely, depending on the performance of an investment, the overall market or the existing interest of third parties.\u201d\nShvo declined to comment, according to Bisnow.\nThe legal clash comes amid mounting concerns in Germany over BVK\u2019s exposure to Shvo\u2019s ventures, which have faced delays and financial troubles. Shvo\u2019s projects \u2014 often funded by German pensioner money \u2014 include the Raleigh Hotel in Miami, Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and 711 Fifth Avenue in New York. BVK has invested more than $712 million in Shvo-related deals via a fund managed by Deutsche Finance America, though the pension fund emphasizes it has no direct contractual relationship with Shvo.\nThe arbitration dispute was sparked in part by leadership upheaval. Rainer Komenda, BVK\u2019s longtime real estate head, and Jason Lucas, who oversaw BVK\u2019s U.S. investments at Deutsche Finance, have both exited their roles. The Bavarian State Parliament has questioned BVK after German tabloid Abendzeitung reported on potential pension fund losses tied to Shvo\u2019s struggling developments. BVK has since launched an internal review.\n\nBVK maintains that its investments are managed prudently and that any potential losses will not impact pension benefits. In 2024, BVK achieved a 3.4 percent net return, which it says exceeds its actuarial requirements.\nSome of Shvo\u2019s projects have stalled or defaulted.\nIn Miami, redevelopment of the historic Raleigh Hotel has dragged on for years, and the property is now subject to a $275 million bid from\nNahla Capital\n, which Shvo can match to retain control. In Beverly Hills, he\ndefaulted\non $200 million in loans just four months after completing the Mandarin Oriental Residences, selling most of the units in bulk to Centurion Real Estate Partners.\nShvo recently achieved a legal victory in a\nhigh-profile dispute\nwith members-only Core Club, a tenant in the Transamerica Pyramid. Earlier this week, a New York judge ordered Core Club to pay him nearly $1 million. The club took out a $750,000 loan from Shvo in 2022, but defaulted by failing to pay up when its location on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue opened the next year.\nCore is appealing the decision and continues to accuse Shvo of misconduct.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Two New Yorkers are facing prison after allegedly swiping a Kew Gardens Hills home from a dying widow \u2014 the first prosecution under the state\u2019s new deed-theft law.\nOn Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia announced the indictment of Deepa Roy, 68, of Manhattan, and Victor Quimis, 39, of Queens, for falsifying property records to take the longtime home of Renuka Bherwani, who was in hospice care. Quimis was arrested earlier this week; Roy remains at large, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nProsecutors say the pair forged Bherwani\u2019s signature in October to transfer the home to themselves for nothing, then repeated the trick in December to move it into a Quimis-controlled shell company. That helped the pair allegedly set up a $552,500 mortgage, which they allegedly used to clear the property\u2019s debts and pocket roughly $312,000.\nRoy allegedly earned at least $15,000 for her part in the scheme.\nBherwani\u2019s family discovered the theft only when city mail congratulating Quimis on his \u201cnew\u201d ownership arrived at the house. The widow, who bought the home with her husband in 1986, had been battling dementia since 2020 and granted power of attorney to her son and daughter-in-law. Prosecutors allege Roy insinuated herself into the home after her husband\u2019s death in 2022, posing as a friend and even asking to move in \u2014 a request the family denied.\n\nJames said deed theft has become rampant in gentrifying neighborhoods where homeowners are \u201ccash-poor and equity-rich,\u201d with scammers targeting seniors and those in financial distress. The attorney general\u2019s office is also probing a Harlem case where a brownstone worth millions was allegedly stolen, leaving its owner homeless.\nThe 2023 law \u2014 drafted by James and Brooklyn state Sen. Zellnor Myrie \u2014 extended the statute of limitations on cases and gave the AG authority to prosecute directly, rather than relying on local district attorneys. A companion measure passed also gave the attorney general and local prosecutors the power to\nhalt court proceedings\nwhere the possession of a property is in dispute.\nBoth Roy and Quimis face charges including grand larceny and residential mortgage fraud, carrying potential sentences of eight to 25 years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property consists of the Tavares Cove I complex and the Tavares Cove II complex.\nLawrence M. Abramson and Sarajane Abramson Marell, as trustees of the Ruth C. Abramson Trust sold Tavares Cove I, according to records. Lawrence M. Abramson and Sarajane Abramson Marell in their individual capacity sold Tavares Cove II.\nThe land spans\u00a0 54.1 acresthat includes a 2,400-square-foot clubhouse completed in 1970 and a 688-square-foot clubhouse completed in 1974, Vizzda records show.\nAcross South Florida, developers have scooped up\nmobile home communities\n, with plans to redevelop them. Generally, residents own their mobile home and rent the lot it sits on.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Havenpark will redevelop Tavares Cove because the firm is a manager of manufactured home communities. The firm, led by CEO Robbie Pratt, installed more than 4,000 affordable manufactured homes since 2019, according to its website.\nPGIM is the asset management arm of financial services firm Prudential Financial\nElsewhere in South Florida, Seville General Partners wants to redevelop the Seville Mobile Home Park at 426 Northeast Fifth Street and 515 North Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach with a\n750-unit multifamily project\nwith\u00a0 25,200 square feet of retail and 44,200 square feet of offices.\nIn December, Cade Capital paid\n$26.5 million\nfor the Sunnyside Motel &amp; Trailer Park at 6020 Southwest Eighth Street in West Miami, as well as an adjacent auto shop. At the time, Cade had no immediate redevelopment plans.\nIn El Portal, Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow and Israeli firm Canada Global plan\n2,380-plus apartments\nwith commercial space and a school on the former\ntrailer park\nsite at 8500 Biscayne Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Mack Real Estate Development, the development subsidiary of Mack Real Estate Group, has received the go-ahead from the Los Angeles City Council for a 51-story residential high-rise in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe proposed tower at 1105-1123 South Olive Street will rise 603 feet and feature 536 studio to three-bedroom apartments above 4,178 square feet of ground-floor commercial space,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n. A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels will hold 581 cars. The design by Arcadis includes rooftop and podium-level amenity decks.\nThe project replaces a surface parking lot. Construction will take more than 30 months, although a start date is not set.\nAlong with project entitlements, the council approved a nearly $11.5 million public benefits package in exchange for a floor area rights transfer from the Los Angeles Convention Center. While officials initially proposed directing some of those funds to the convention center itself, revised conditions now allocate the funds toward affordable housing.\nThe high-rise is one part of Mack\u2019s broader redevelopment vision for the Downtown L.A. market. A second proposed tower \u2014 a 60-story building with more than 700 units \u2014 is planned just east across Olive Street.\n\nThose developments are the final phases of a large-scale plan Mack Real Estate launched a decade ago with AECOM. Completed elements include the 362-unit Wren apartments on Pico Boulevard, the 38-story Aven tower on Grand Avenue and a pocket park. Additionally, a 16-story hotel has already been approved for a nearby site at 12th Street and Olive.\nTogether, the projects mark a transformation of the South Park neighborhood in Downtown L.A., as high-density mixed-use towers replace surface parking lots and industrial buildings.\nNew York-based Mack was founded in 2013 after William Mack liquidated his family\u2019s holdings in Apollo Real Estate Advisers, according to the company website. It has three divisions focused on development and ownership, lending and property management. The company is run by CEO Richard Mack.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Harris County commissioners rejected a proposal Thursday from Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo for a \u201cpenny\u201d property tax increase by neglecting to take a vote before a noon deadline to send the tax question to voters in November.\nSeeking to fill a coming budget gap from expiring American Rescue Plan Act federal dollars the county used to fund child care programs, Hidalgo claimed the hike of $10 per $100,000 of valuation would add $24 per year to the average homeowner\u2019s property tax bill, the Texas Scorecard\nreported\n.\nThe proposal was expected to generate about $60 million a year in property tax revenue for the county, proponents said. Projected revenues were not published in the Harris County Commissioners Court\u2019s meeting agenda. Even though Hidalgo pitched her plan as a \u201cpenny\u201d increase, no specific numbers were put forth.\nDemocrat commissioners Lesley Briones, Rodney Ellis and Adrian Garcia withheld support for Hidalgo\u2019s proposal along with Republican Commissioner Tom Ramsey. As no one seconded Hidalgo\u2019s proposal for a vote, it died.\n\nEllis proposed his own plan, which would\u2019ve increased the county tax rate by 2.8 cents per $100 valuation, and Judge Hidalgo seconded the measure, but it failed in a 3-2 vote.\nThe failed motions came after a contentious morning where Hidalgo held signs with her staff and encouraged children in the audience, who were purportedly recipients of child care paid for from the ARPA funds, to take part in demonstrations for the property tax hike. The judge and fellow commissioners also accused one another of lying to the public.\nResident resentment to additional taxes is growing, the outlet said. After last year\u2019s disastrous spring and summer storms, the May derecho and Hurricane Beryl in July, Commissioners passed a disaster-rate tax hike \u2014 allowed by the state of Texas to bypass the typical 3.5 percent threshold that would require voter-approval. That raised the county\u2019s overall tax rate from $0.35007 to $0.38529 per $100 valuation.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold the apartment for roughly double what they paid for it nine years earlier.\nPlans for the 9,500-square-foot penthouse at 140 Jane Street include floor-to-ceiling windows, a wraparound terrace and three balconies. The building, which quietly launched sales last summer, is slated for completion in early 2027.

Both King-Brown and Field declined to share the sale price.\nNews of the contract first surfaced in an Instagram post on Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg\u2019s account pushing back against industry outcry against private exclusive listings, including criticisms that marketing homes through this channel prevents sellers from nabbing top-tier prices.\n\u201cThe Downtown luxury markets are significantly healthier than the numbers being reported.\u00a0 Especially in brand new buildings,\u201d Steinberg wrote in the comment. \u201cThose spewing a narrative that private exclusives depress all pricing are obviously very wrong.\u201d\nJake Indursky contributed reporting.\n",

Cejas\u2019 420 Lincoln Rd Development LLC is requesting to rezone the 1.6-acre site at that address, to replace the 15,340-square-foot commercial building at 1600 Washington Avenue with a planned 15-story, 210-unit multifamily development, the outlet reported.\nThe apartments will span nearly 217,000 square feet, including 7,000 square feet of retail, a pool deck, 36 studio units, 144 one-bedroom units and 30 two-bedroom units. Units will range in size from 560 square feet to 1,100 square feet.

        "content": "At last,\nJim Carrey\nhas found a buyer for his ranch-style abode in Brentwood.\nThe deal closed Friday, according to people with knowledge of the transaction, for $17 million. That\u2019s about a 41 percent discount from Carrey\u2019s original ask in 2023.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Graham J. Larson represented Carrey in the sale of 615 North Tigertail Road. Larson could not be immediately reached for comment Friday afternoon.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Sam Collins, David Parnes and James Harris negotiated the deal on behalf of the buyer. The identity of the new homeowner is unclear with the deed on Friday\u2019s closing not yet recorded with Los Angeles County.\nCarolwood declined to comment on the deal.\nBrentwood, a community within the city of Los Angeles, is subject to the tiered Measure United to House L.A. tax on deals of $5.3 million or more. Billed as the \u201cmansion tax,\u201d it\u2019s likely to cut into the \u201cLiar Liar\u201d and \u201cBruce Almighty\u201d star\u2019s profit. Still he walks away with a tidy sum in comparison to the\n$3.8 million\nhe paid for the property in 1994. That\u2019s the same year \u201cAce Ventura: Pet Detective\u201d made its debut.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride for Carrey\u2019s former Brentwood estate, which has seen price changes and also changed listing agents over time.\nThe property first hit the market in 2023 for $28.9 million. A series of price reductions followed, with the home\ngoing into contract\nin December, when it was asking $19.8 million, according to listing sites. That deal didn\u2019t get done and the home was relisted in February for $19.8 million, with the home most recently asking $18.8 million in May.\nThe incoming buyer gets a sprawling estate consisting of a nearly 11,000-square-foot home with five bedrooms and nine bathrooms. Highlights of the residence include skylights, six fireplaces and an art deco-design theater complete with its own popcorn concession.\nThe outdoors is massive, with the residence sitting on a 2-acre lot that holds a tennis court, gardens, waterfall pool, pool house, sauna and steam room, according to the listing.\nAny concerns of privacy are addressed with nearly 300 feet of hedges fronting the property.\n",

        "content": "A historic Oak Park home reoriented onsite and redesigned by Frank Lloyd Wright is back on the market for the first time in 24 years.\nThe Hills-DeCaro House was built in 1883 as a Victorian and purchased in 1900 by Wright\u2019s client, Nathan Moore, as a gift for his daughter. Wright updated the six-bedroom, 6,350-square-foot home in his Prairie style, turning the home 90 degrees in the process, as reported in\nCrain\u2019s\n. The asking price for the 313 Forest Avenue home is just shy of $2.3 million. Wright also added two verandas on the first floor and updated the home\u2019s siding to stucco with dark wood trim.\nThe home has a long history of renovations and other unique details: a fire in 1976 caused during a restoration project burned most of the first floor, according to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. Also on the one-third acre property stands a ticket booth from the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, held 20 miles away in Jackson Park. It was first used by the Hills family as a children\u2019s playhouse.\n\nThe previous owners restored the home from the fire and updated its utilities, and the windows are recreations of the original glass style. The kitchen was also expanded to modern preferences from what had been a small galley kitchen, opening up smaller rooms to pair it with a breakfast room. The basement was also updated for entertainment. The current owners also added a walled, private patio in the backyard.\nBoth the living room fireplace and the primary bedroom fireplace feature narrow, horizontal Roman bricks, and built-in bookcases are featured throughout. The sunroom on the first floor was previously an open-air porch, but now has windows with views of other Wright homes in the area, such as the original home Moore commissioned Wright to design in 1895 in the Tudor style.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The debt, from University Place Asset Management and Axonic Capital, amounts to nearly $3 million per unit.\nThe developer, One Turtle Creek LLC, is a joint venture between Swiss wealth advisory firm SVAG and USA Infrastructure Investments.\nThe deal refinanced the previous construction loan and provided the needed capital required to complete the 18-story project.\nThe units are expected to be priced from $3 million to $20 million, spanning 2,000 to 6,380 square feet. Its amenities will include views of the Dallas skyline, a private garden, infinity pool, dog park, pet spa and library.\n\nThe building will be managed by Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts. It\u2019s within walking distance from the five-star hotel Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, where Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts was founded. The hospitality company is now headquartered in Hong Kong.\nThe units are expected to attract locals as well as buyers from all over the world, said Eric Sitman, managing director of Axonic Capital. Chicago-based Lucien Lagrange Studio is the architectural firm working on the project, and Compass is handling sales.\nThe project is anticipated to be completed in about a year.\nThe Dallas luxury condo market is less developed than in cities like New York and Miami, but it\u2019s\ngradually maturing\n. Other developments underway include the Knox Hotel and Residences, which will be managed by Auberge Resorts Collection. The developer is a venture of Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Partners and Dallas-based Trammell Crow Company. It\u2019s expected to have 48 condos and 150 hotel rooms.

        "content": "Thousands of housing units, missed deadlines and another boost for federal housing tax credits.\nThese describe some of the major housing-related headlines of the week. Thrilling, right?\nThe first refers to the\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which could pave the way for roughly 9,500 new housing units over the next decade. This week, City Council carved out some midblock properties in the Garment District and reduced residential density allowed in the southeast portion of the rezoning in a nod to the manufacturers still operating in the neighborhood. The changes reduced housing projections by 140-ish units.\nThe fact that the Garment District carveout only affects portions of the midblocks is key.\nTo exempt all midblock areas on West 36th and 40th streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues would have eliminated a lot more housing opportunities. By my count, at least 458 units of projected housing across six properties would have been shaved off the production numbers estimated by City Planning if residential was removed from all the midblocks in that area (the City Council subcommittee meeting on Wednesday made it sound like that was the change).\nThe language for the modifications was released Thursday night, which cleared things up a bit, but not before I printed out maps of Midtown South and highlighted the properties on the midblocks where housing would be lost, like a crazy person.\nAnyway, some have questioned the wisdom of the carveout, even if it is more surgical than what had previously been proposed.\n\u201cThis area has long since ceased to include any meaningful manufacturing activity, let alone garment factories or assembly,\u201d Herrick\u2019s Mitch Korbey tells me. \u201cThe Planning Commission saw this and appropriately called for a rezoning \u2014 we should trust and abide by the thoughtful and careful planning work done by the experts.\u00a0 Maintaining manufacturing zoning where no manufacturing jobs or activity exists is not sound planning \u2014 it simply will keep vacant or under-utilized buildings that could have a new and vibrant life as apartments and affordable housing.\u201d\nCouncil members said the changes were made to preserve the area\u2019s unique ecosystem of businesses and ensure \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side.\u201d\nAlso this week, the state held a meeting about the megadevelopment Pacific Park that \u2014\u00a0by the state\u2019s own deadlines \u2014\u00a0should have involved discussions about a newly approved development team for the project. Alas, the meeting was largely about why the meeting was\nnot\nabout the newly approved developers.\nEmpire State Development previously said that a new development team would be approved and the development rights for six of the Pacific Park sites transferred by August 1. That didn\u2019t happen, according to state officials, because the proposed development team \u2014\u00a0Cirrus and LCOR \u2014\u00a0also submitted an application to take over another property known as Site 5. The officials said they need more time to review both takeover bids. They hope to finish this up sometime in September. Maybe. For a full rundown, check out my\nstory\n.\nAt the federal level, housing groups this week celebrated the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s decision to raise the amount that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can invest in low-income housing tax credits. Each can now invest $2 billion, up from the $1 billion cap set last year.\n\nThe change comes after the \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d reconciliation bill expanded the tax credits. Per the National Housing Conference\u2019s David Dworkin, the increase is an important complement to the credit expansion, because it will help \u201censure that the market will absorb the additional credits without diminishing their value.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What questions do you have for the mayoral candidates that haven\u2019t been addressed in their various public events and interviews? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The number of listings submitted to local listing services between June 11 (when the FARE Act went into effect) and July 31 has dropped 74 percent year-over-year,\nTRD\n\u2019s\nSheridan Wall reports\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The DOJ has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, the\nNew York Times\nreports. The investigation concerns two separate cases from James\u2019 office: the suit in which President Trump and his organization were found liable for fraud, and a case regarding the National Rifle Association\u2019s tax fraud. This follows the FBI\u2019s probe into the AG\u2019s real estate dealings.\n\u2014 Andrew Cuomo presented his affordability plan during a press conference on Thursday, comparing his agenda with Zohran Mamdani\u2019s, which he called irresponsible and unrealistic,\namNY\nreports. Cuomo outlined his plans for transportation, groceries, wages and taxes. This is the second briefing of its kind, following Monday\u2019s discussion of crime and public safety.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams opened a new campaign office in Mill Basin. One problem: the building has a full vacate order still in place, according to\nthe City\n. In 2023, the parapet of the building collapsed, leading the Department of Buildings to issue the vacancy order that\u2019s still in effect. Though the wall has been repaired, the building will need to be reinspected before the campaign office can open. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$22 million\nfor a condominium unit at 520 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill condo is a new-construction unit and 4,700 square feet.\nPeter Ashe\u2019s\nAsher Alcobi and Meirav Gavrielov have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.3 million\nfor a development site at\u00a0 20-35 130th Street. Manhattan developer\nTurnbridge Equities\npurchased the 103,000-square-foot Queens lot.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $2.9 million for a condo unit at 2505 Broadway. The Upper West Side condo is 1,300 square feet.\nThe Agency\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 95,238-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 444 Carroll Street in Brooklyn. Architect Kao Hwa Lee is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Want to see what prepared looks like?\nTake a glance at the\nAECOM\npresentation given to Pacific Palisades residents Thursday evening during an over two-hour community meeting. Specific actions and timelines for deliverables were offered to residents. That cuts a stark contrast to the April debacle when a representative from\nHagerty Consulting\nspoke to residents, but was unable to answer questions around what the Chicago outfit had done in relation to infrastructure, public health and community outreach.\nHagerty\u2019s Chicago headquarters has been a point of contention for some, who think a local will do what\u2019s best for locals. Maybe the AECOM reps at Thursday\u2019s meeting heard that and meant to take a shot when Matt Talley, senior vice president and client account manager at AECOM, told residents, \u201cOur U.S. business is based here in Los Angeles, and I\u2019ll just repeat that. We\u2019re based in Los Angeles and so we\u2019re part of the community.\u201d\nPowerPoint to PowerPoint, AECOM outlined more than 15 meetings with city divisions such as the Department of Water and Power and the Los Angeles Police Department; over 10 community meetings; and outlined its plans for infrastructure restoration, future fire protection and logistics and traffic management. The Hagerty presentation talked up a \u201cstructured approach\u201d to rebuilding, \u201cresilience as an emerging recovery focus\u201d and \u201crecovery support functions.\u201d\nOn fire rebuild fees, Measure ULA\nPermit fees\nand taxes continue to make their way into rebuild discussions. Final decisions are hard to come by.\nCouncil member Traci Park, whose district includes the Palisades, revealed a lengthy document during Thursday\u2019s Palisades community meeting, called the \u201cPacific Palisades Vision.\u201d\nPark described the \u201cvision document\u201d as the culmination of months of conversations with residents at town halls, community meetings and other events.\nAmong her thoughts was an acknowledgement of the need to waive fees for property owners and renters. Park\u2019s stance on this is not new. Her motion passed earlier this year by the city\u2019s Ad Hoc Committee for L.A. Recovery needs to move through the Budget and Finance Committee next before consideration by the full Los Angeles City Council. Currently, the city has stopped collecting permit fees, but that is not permanent.\nThe idea could face a potentially uphill battle.\n\u201cThere is about a $90 million impact to the general fund to waive those fees,\u201d Park told residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere will be discussion amongst my [city council] colleagues about whether we can do it. Can we afford to do it? Should we do it?\u201d\nPark made clear her opinion that permit fees should be done away with regardless of whether someone is building the same exact footprint or not.\nPark also acknowledged in her vision document what she called the \u201cdetrimental effects\u201d of the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n2022 ballot measure, a property tax which applies to all real estate transactions in the city starting at $5.3 million. Those in real estate say it\u2019s done nothing but chill deals and development. In the Palisades it could prove another hurdle in the recovery.\nPark said she\u2019s working with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and state lawmakers on a possible solution.\nNew attitudes on modular, prefab housing\nIt\u2019s not as though a raft of wildfire victims are enlisting modular or pre-fab housing manufacturers to get them back on their lots and inside\nfaster\nand cheaper. However, it\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s a growing contingent going that route.\nAbout 28 percent of those surveyed in late spring and early summer by Park\u2019s office in the Palisades said they\u2019re considering modular or prefab construction.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly are identical stories: People seeking us out because they\u2019re underinsured and they\u2019re looking for alternative ways to build aside from timber,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Brien, Hapi Homes\u2019 CEO and co-founder.\nHapi Homes has 30 rebuild clients in Altadena and Pasadena. RSG 3-D is counting between 40 and 50 homeowners who have architects and intend to use the company\u2019s panelized materials. Hapi Homes and RSG 3-D are what\u2019s known as\nmakers of panelized housing\nthat come in kits assembled on site at a resident\u2019s lot.\nWarring construction quotes\nAsk anyone how much it\u2019s going to cost to rebuild a home burned in the Palisades or Eaton fires and you\u2019ll get a different answer. That quote\u2019s also likely to change next month and the month after that.\nStill,\nOpus Builders\u2019 Gary Mkrtichyan\ncan\u2019t make some of the math on rebuilds that he\u2019s hearing pencil out. While Opus Builders \u2014 a construction company with its own in-house architecture and design services \u2014 charges $550 to $600 per square foot, Mkrtichyan hears all about some firms charging $700, $750 and beyond.\nPalisades residents estimated their construction costs averaging $800 per square foot in an Urban Land Institute-sponsored survey in the spring, while Altadena\u2019s mean was $580 per square foot.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d Mkrtichyan said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nBrad Pitt heads to Hollywood Hills\nBrad Pitt\n\u2019s moving, and so is The Killers guitarist Dave Keuning.\nThe \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d star earlier this week paid $12 million for a Hollywood Hills home sold by Keuning and his wife and interior designer Emilie Keuning.\nThat was a nice, double-ended deal for Carolwood Estates.\nThe Beverly Hills brokerage\u2019s David Parnes, Sam Collins and James Harris represented the Keunings. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Marci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi represented Pitt.\nMalibu\u2019s $80M trade\nAnyone have more details on the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\nin Malibu?\nThe multiparcel deal traded off market last month, per the deed, but it has limited liability companies on both sides of the transaction.\nAlso unclear is if the buyer and seller were represented by any agents in the deal, which is so far the priciest trade on record in Malibu this year.\nThe property consists of a 1.4-acre lot with a 1,300-square-foot residence, while the other lot is empty.\n",

        "content": "A Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga-leased property on Rodeo Drive\nsold\nfor more than $400 million.\nRonan McNamee\u2019s ECA Capital Limited was the seller. The company purchased the 28,000-square-foot property at 338 North Rodeo Drive for $81.5 million in 2007 \u2014 and McNamee refinanced the property at $160 million six years ago. The identity of the buyer wasn\u2019t immediately known.\nThe deal is believed to be the second-highest sale ever in Beverly Hills, after Nicholas and Christian Candy\u2019s $500 million purchase of what was once a Robinson\u2019s-May department store in 2007. The 338 North Rodeo Drive sale could be a one-property record for the famed street, and the building may have fetched the lavish price because of its development potential.\nOther pricey retail sales along the iconic street include LVMH\u2019s $245 million purchase of a 22,300-square-foot, two-story double lot at 468 North Rodeo Drive; hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s $200 million sale of the 43,000-square-foot lot that held a boutique hotel plus three retail stores at 360 North Rodeo Drive; and Crown Equity\u2019s Michael Shabani\u2019s purchase of two storefronts spanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for $112 million.\nCaruso for small businesses\nBillionaire Rick Caruso\u2019s nonprofit\nannounced\na $1 million donation from Banc of California\u2019s Wildfire Relief &amp; Recovery Fund for small businesses.\nThe small business initiative aims to support retailers, restaurants and other businesses in Altadena, Malibu and the Pacific Palisades impacted by the wildfires earlier this year via direct grants of up to $50,000.\n\u201cThese small businesses were about much more than commercial or economic activity. They were local hallmarks that gave neighborhoods their soul and fostered a sense of community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cWe cannot abandon them. This is about ensuring they have the tools, resources and support they need to come back.\u201d\nThe businessman and once mayoral candidate\u2019s Pacific Palisades mall survived the fires thanks to private firefighters, but is closed because of the devastation surrounding it.\n\u201cThese businesses aren\u2019t faceless storefronts. They are the fabric of the community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cThey are made up of people: owners, employees and loyal customers. They deserve an advocate to help address the challenges they\u2019re facing through no fault of their own. Through this initiative, they\u2019ll have one.\u201d\nMore losses at Hudson Pacific Properties\nHudson Pacific Properties has fallen on hard times.\nThe company\nreported\nan $83 million loss for the second quarter compared to a $47 million loss a year earlier.\nRevenues decreased to $190 million from $218 million a year ago because of declining office occupancies and discounted asset sales \u2014 that includes a San Francisco office building the company sold earlier this summer for $28 million, about half the $56.5 million Hudson Pacific purchased it for a decade ago.\nThe real estate investment trust\u2019s office revenues fell to $156 million in the three months ending June 30, compared to $176 million during the same period last year. Production studio revenues fared worse too, dropping to $34 million from $42 million year-over-year.\nHudson Pacific chair and CEO Victor Coleman, whose total compensation was valued at about $25 million last year despite ballooning losses, hinted at offloading more properties in the future and commended leasing during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nHudson Pacific executed 558,000 square feet in leases in the second quarter, a small increase from a year earlier. Second-quarter leases included a six-year, 77,000-square-foot renewal with a cybersecurity company in Foster City; a nine-year, 41,000-square-foot renewal with a digital sports company in Los Angeles; and a six-year, 32,000-square-foot new lease with a bio-tech company in Palo Alto.\nOffice-to-resi in Westood\nDouglas Emmett\nplans\nto turn an office tower it purchased for $131 million from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure into apartments.\nThe 17-story, 247,000-square-foot office building at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, coupled with a residential building Douglas Emmett plans to construct on the same lot, is set to become a 320-apartment complex in Westwood. The real estate investment trust\u2019s CEO, Jordan Kaplan, said he expects the conversion to enhance the property\u2019s value during its second-quarter earnings call. Still, the conversion will occur over an undisclosed number of years as offices are vacated on a floor-by-floor basis \u2014 and anticipated costs have increased.\n\u201cIncluding the costs to acquire the property, convert the existing office tower and construct the new building, we expect this plan to increase the total project costs to approximately $200 million to $250 million,\u201d the company said in an earnings release.\nBefore the planned conversion, the company expected the cost to be $150 million to $200 million, and that would include the acquisition, construction of the apartment building and upgrades to the existing tower.\nA loyal law firm\nLaw firm Behar Gibbs Savage Paulson\nrenewed\nits about 36,000-square-foot lease across two floors at One World Trade Center in Long Beach.\nBehar Gibbs Savage Paulson has occupied the top two floors of the 27-story, approximately 575,000-square-foot building for the last 35 years. The building\u2019s asking rents are between $2.95 to $3.15 per square foot per month.\nSince 2023, Los Angeles office absorption has been increasingly dominated by law firms and financial companies. The two years before, technology and entertainment companies led the way.\nFisher Phillips inked a new lease for about 36,000 square feet at 515 South Flower Street in Downtown Los Angeles \u2014 and an almost 14,000-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills last week. Paul Hastings, Hill, Farrer &amp; Burrill, Hanson Bridgett and Mayer Brown have renewed or signed new leases Downtown in recent years, too.\nArts District\u2019s all-in-one\nThe Los Angeles City Council\ngave\nthe green light for Danish architect Bjarke Ingels\u2019 mixed-use high-rise development in the Arts District.\nThe project at 670 Mesquit Street, which has been in the works for almost a decade, is set to hold four interconnected towers, the tallest of which would be 34 stories. The developer, Vella Group, plans to build 676,000 square feet of office space; 894 residential units; a 271-room hotel; a charter elementary school; and commercial spaces for retail, restaurant and art galleries.\nThe mixed-use campus will replace the Rancho Cold Storage facility owned for years by the Gallo family. Construction is expected to take place either over a single five-year period or in separate phases over nine years. A completion date has not yet been announced but total cost is estimated at $1.4 billion.\nIt was initially proposed as an office-heavy development but has shifted to mostly housing.\n",

        "content": "When U.S. Rep. Danny Davis announced he was not running for re-election, he became the third Congress person representing Illinois to do so this year. And because two U.S. Representatives are running to fill retiring U.S. Senator Dick Durbin\u2019s seat, a fourth position may end up vacant as well.\nThe Congressional shake up comes at a time when real estate players have a lot on the line. While rent growth in Chicago is\nbrewing a hot multifamily market,\nsluggish construction starts indicate that developers and lenders aren\u2019t as active as they could be. At the same time, Chicago\u2019s office market is stuck in a rut, reporting a record high 27 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter of this year. And the suburban office market\nisn\u2019t faring much better.\nAs a result, the industry is keeping a close watch on any potential political changes on the horizon.\nReal estate scion Jason Friedman\nposted the first fundraising numbers in the race to replace Davis and is coming away as an early favorite of the industry.\nProminent donors include Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Private Investment billionaire Craig Duchossois, CRG CEO Shawn Clark among others.\nDavis\u2019 district is of significant interest to real estate because it includes much of the Loop and Fulton Market.\n\nFriedman, son of prolific River North developer Albert Friedman, appears to be downplaying his ties to the business while campaigning. A press release characterized his $1 million fundraising haul as a collection of donations from \u201ccommunity leaders and grassroots supporters.\u201d And his website refers to his Chicagoan grandfather and great grandfather, but skips over his father, whose company he served as president of from 2005 until 2023.\nIn a Q&amp;A with\nThe Real Deal\n, however,\nFriedman embraced his industry experience\n.\nThe race ahead of the March 17 primaries will be where the real action plays out because the district is considered safely Democratic.\nAt least eight other challengers have recently joined the race, including state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who Davis endorsed last week. When the newer candidates report their fundraising totals next quarter,\u00a0 the results will likely reveal more nuances about other coalitions forming.\nMeanwhile, at the city level, it\u2019s politics as usual.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration\nclosed two investigations\nby the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into the city of Chicago\u2019s zoning practices, a move that will likely end recent efforts to reform the informal practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nLocal housing advocates had hoped the federal investigations would lead to reforming or ending aldermen\u2019s control over zoning in their respective wards. The investigations stemmed from a 2018 lawsuit that alleged such control led to racial segregation and dampened affordable housing development in wealthy, predominately white neighborhoods.\nThe city had already entered a voluntary agreement to negotiate a resolution after federal housing authorities found merit in the claims. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s administration was reportedly near an agreement at the end of last year, but negotiations tapered off after Trump took office.",
