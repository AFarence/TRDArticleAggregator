        "content": "A family saga is one step closer to a finale. Mark Harounian notched a win in his legal battle with the sister who sued him a decade ago.\nMehrnaz Homapour claimed her brother duped her into signing agreements that let him enrich himself off family real estate companies. But a state judge Monday said she failed to demonstrate fraud, deciding several claims in her brother\u2019s favor.\nThe case, which is headed to trial, provides a look into how disputes arise in families where money is plentiful and agreements are informal.\nMark Harounian is the son of Jacob Harounian, the Iranian investor who made money in the Persian rug business before turning to Manhattan real estate. Mark\u2019s sisters are minority members in family LLCs that Mark manages.\nHomapour claimed her brother took funds from the companies to support his own investments, as well as allegedly pay for an \u201coutrageously lavish\u201d lifestyle of luxury cars, famous art and \u201cjewelry and rent-free apartments for his mistresses.\u201d\nAnd when her brother asked her to sign documents related to the family business, he told her there was nothing new in the paperwork, Homapour claimed. Instead, those agreements allowed Harounian to compensate himself for his work as manager.\nHomapour argued this was fraud. But a judge said that claim doesn\u2019t hold up when Homapour admits she didn\u2019t read or inquire about what she was signing.\n\n\u201cThis is putting to bed the scandalous and unsupported claims of fraud and clearing Mark Harounian\u2019s good name,\u201d said Todd Soloway, an attorney for Harounian.\nThe judge similarly dismissed other efforts by Homapour to get a quick decision to set up a trust for the assets and get her brother removed as a member of the LLCs.\nThe case will now be sent to trial, where the parties will argue over whether Harounian\u2019s compensation from the companies was reasonable.\nAttorneys for Homapour said they were pleased the court is bringing those claims about the compensation to trial and also ordered Harounian to give a full accounting of company finances.\n\u201cThis decision is another significantly positive step towards our client ultimately recovering the tens of millions of dollars Mark wrongfully took from the family companies,\u201d Homapour\u2019s attorneys, Terrence Oved, Darren Oved and Glen Lenihan at Oved &amp; Oved LLP, said in a statement.\nThe case is just one battle in the family\u2019s civil war. Patriarch Jacob Harounian has sued Mark for similar claims in a case that is still ongoing. A company Mark manages won its own case against Jacob in 2023, claiming that he wired himself $5 million from a company account.\n",

        "content": "Overall, there were 253 deals, totaling about $475 million, recorded in New York City on Wednesday, Aug. 13.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nCentral Park Tower at\n217 West 57th Street\nin Midtown notched the highest residential sale in New York.\nMatthew Kaulig\n, owner of the NASCAR team Kaulig Racing, and his wife\nLisa Kaulig\ndropped about $17.6 million \u2014 about $5,200 per square foot \u2014\u00a0on a sponsor unit at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, which was developed by\nGary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development Company\n. The 3,400-square-foot, three-bedroom unit first hit the market in August of 2022, with an asking price of $22.6 million, but its most recent asking price was $18.9 million. Extell Marketing Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini\nand\nTim Rizzo\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nNew York\u2019s top commercial real estate transaction was in Glendale. The Shops at Atlas Park, an open-air shopping center at\n80-00 Cooper Avenue\n, traded for $72 million. The buyer was\nBen Ashkenazy\u2019s Askenazy Acquisition Corp.\n, and the seller was California-based\nMacerich.\nThe property, which is 97 percent leased, spans 370,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $195 per square foot. Macerich had owned the mall since 2011, when the firm purchased it via a foreclosure auction for $54 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Bay Ridge, the\nGindi family\u2019s\nsale of the former Century 21 flagship store in Bay Ridge for $47.5 million hit records. The buyer was a joint venture between Baltimore-based\nMCB Real Estate\nand Istanbul-based\nOsiris Ventures.\nThe 14-parcel property spans 95,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $500 per square foot. The buyers plan to redevelop the site into a grocery-anchored shopping center. JLL\u2019s\nEthan Stanton, Jeffrey Julien\nand\nBrendan Maddigan\narranged the deal.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA company managed by\nKim Soonbin\noffloaded a 36-unit apartment complex at\n331 Keap Street\nin East Williamsburg. The buyer, an LLC tied to\nJanusz Sendowski\n, paid just over $9 million for the nearly 22,000-square-foot, six-story building. The seller bought the property about six years ago for $15.5 million. The latest deal marks a nearly 42 percent loss.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Michael and Kelly Kong\npaid $9.8 million for a townhouse at\n37 West 74th Street\non the Upper West Side. The seller,\nKensington Investments Limited\n, had owned the building for decades. The six-bedroom home measures about 6,600 square feet and has a garden, seven fireplaces, terrace and built-in barbecue. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nRoberta Golubock\nhad the listing.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: David and Virginia Apple\nparted with a five-bedroom co-op unit at\n1220 Park Avenue\non Carnegie Hill. The buyers were\nBrian Davis\n, a financial executive, and\nCayla O\u2019Connell Davis\n, a fashion entrepreneur, who paid just under $9 million for the pad. The Apples purchased the unit in 2013 for about $7.8 million, then listed it for sale in January for $9.5 million. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nAmanda Cannon Goldworm, Megan Duryea Scott, Merrill Curtis\nand\nGeoff McKernan\nrepresented the sellers.\nBy the Numbers:\nMiami ranks No. 1 for super-rich second homeowners \u2014 but New York boasts most ultra-wealthy homeowners\nMiami is the No. 1 spot \u2014 on the planet \u2014 for the super-rich to purchase second homes, according to a report from Altrata, a data provider for the wealth industry.\nMore than 13,200 ultra-high-net-worth people, or those with a net worth of more than $30 million, have second properties in Miami. That\u2019s about three-fourths of Miami\u2019s ultra-high-net-worth population \u2014 the greatest share of the top 20 cities.\nThe city with the most super-wealthy homeowners is New York, which has more than 33,200 owners in that category. The Big Apple ranks second for having the most second homes among the ultra-rich, with more than 12,800.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "New York has a long, drawn-out process for foreclosing on homes.\nThat is by design: Homeowners are given time because the loss of their primary residence can be catastrophic and is often avoidable. Residential foreclosures shouldn\u2019t be rushed.\nIn contrast, non-judicial UCC foreclosures are fast \u2014 60 days, and notices are limited. The process is intended for commercial properties, whose owners are sophisticated enough to deal with it.\nUnfortunately, it also applies to co-op shares owned by regular people.\nLet\u2019s say Mrs. Smith suffers from dementia, forgets to pay her monthly maintenance charges for a while and stops reading her mail. The co-op board can foreclose on her shares and sell the unit at an auction on the courthouse steps.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for clueless owners to show up and ask the auctioneer what\u2019s going on, only to be told their home is being sold by the board \u2014 even though its market value far exceeds the unpaid dues. Some real estate professionals are regulars at these auctions, looking to buy co-op units for a fraction of their market value, as my colleague Keith Larsen has\nwritten\n.\nSometimes the buyer is the co-op board itself, hoping to recoup the arrears (and then some) by buying and reselling the unit.\nWe have even heard of situations where the winning bidder is rejected by the co-op board, forcing another auction to be held. The board keeps rejecting winners until it becomes the sole bidder. It\u2019s unclear how often this happens, but it\u2019s said to be common at some buildings. Even one instance is too many.\nProblems with UCC foreclosures on co-ops do not appear to be on politicians\u2019 radar. An ideal system would balance the interests of co-op boards, delinquent shareholders and buyers.\nA protracted, bureaucratic process would be unfair to boards trying to collect maintenance fees, but neither should people lose their homes in 60 days because they owe a modest amount of money and didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat reform would you suggest for dealing with unpaid co-op dues? Should a guardian be appointed for the homeowner, allowing for a home equity loan or traditional sale that would pay the arrears and put any excess in the seller\u2019s pocket? Or could a cure be worse than the problem?\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Labyrinth, a company focused on streamlining permitting, came up with a \u201c\nred tape index\n\u201d to measure how efficiently states and localities process building permits, zoning changes and related approvals.\n\nNot coincidentally, the worst performers were the states with the most expensive housing markets.\nMassachusetts was 45th, followed by Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and the absolute worst, Hawaii.\nTennessee claimed the best score, followed by Florida, Texas, Indiana and Arizona.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A developer of Pacific Park wasn\u2019t fined by New York state for missing key deadlines because the firm threatened to sue, according to\nGothamist\n. Greenland USA would have faced more than $1.75 million in monthly penalties after failing to complete 876 units of affordable housing by the\nMay 31 deadline\n. Greenland cited \u201cunavoidable delays.\u201d The decks over the rail yard that were supposed to support the new housing have\nyet to be built\n.\n\u2014 The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated five Garment District buildings as historical landmarks ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote on the Midtown South rezoning,\namNY\nreported. If the City Council signs off on the designation, any future changes to the exterior or structure of the buildings would need to be approved by the LPC.\n\u2014 City officials published a new master plan for New York\u2019s greenways,\nGothamist\nreported. The plan aims to connect more of the city\u2019s existing greenways and includes 40 miles of new paths.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.8 million\nfor a 6,576-square-foot townhouse at 37 West 74th Street on the Upper West Side. Roberta Golubock of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial sale recorded was for five properties in Bay Ridge by ASG Equities to MCB Real Estate and Osiris Ventures for $43.6 million.\nThe Real Deal\nreported the deal Aug. 5.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 4,089-square-foot condominium unit in The Cortland at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of Core NYC has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 391,830-square-foot, 387-unit residential building at 23-07 43 Avenue in Long Island City. Handel Architects filed the permit on behalf of William Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Renovation is underway for an aging Oak Cliff apartment complex that was at the center of a bribery case.\nNew York-based Fairstead purchased the 168-unit Royal Crest Apartments at 3558 Wilhurt Avenue. Fairstead secured a $33 million renovation loan from Capital One, according to county records, amounting to almost $198,000 per unit. Fairstead stated that total rehabilitation costs will be about $24 million, or $142,857 per unit.\nThe seller is AmeriSouth Realty Group, owned by Ruel Hamilton, a local developer\nrecently acquitted of bribery\nin a retrial. Hamilton was previously convicted of bribing a Dallas City Council member between 2013 and 2015 to gain support for a renovation of Royal Crest.\nThe Section 8 subsidized housing development was built in 1969 and hasn\u2019t undergone a substantial renovation in five decades, according to Fairstead. The renovations will include energy efficiency features, a computer lab, a children\u2019s play area and an improved laundry facility. The renovated community center will also offer career training, financial literacy courses and after-school programming for K-12 students.\n\nFairstead\u2019s portfolio spans 28 states and includes over a thousand units in Texas, but this project is the company\u2019s first Texas rehabilitation, according to a news release. Renovation began this month and is expected to wrap up in fall of 2026.\nMore development is expected\nin West Oak Cliff\nafter the Dallas City Council voted on Wednesday to rezone 35 acres for residential and mixed-use development. Proponents said rezoning will encourage development of vacant lots, but opponents said rezoning could price out current residents.\nAnother affordable housing development is planned for a\nWest Oak Cliff church site\n. Generation Partners is demolishing the former Templo de Alabanza church at 4710 West Illinois Avenue to make way for a 22-unit development that will offer services similar to Fairstead\u2019s at Royal Crest, including financial literacy programs and free tax preparation.\nOther recent trades in Oak Cliff include 1235 Hartsdale Drive, a 94-unit multifamily property purchased by syndicators Cody Gustafson and Robert Slattery last month.\n",

The property sold last week after being listed in late June.\nThe home was previously listed at under $12 million in 2022, according to the Business Journal.

The home also features a four-car garage and views of the Pacific Ocean and Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nOther big-ticket transactions in the county this year include a Carmel Highlands estate that\nsold\nin June for $14.8 million, a property in Carmel that sold for $15.5 million that same month and another Carmel estate in April that traded hands for $17.5 million.\n\nThe median listing home price in Pebble Beach as of June was $3.5 million, representing an 8 percent drop year-over-year, according to the Business Journal. The median sale price was $2.8 million with homes spending about 10 weeks on the market.\nPebble Beach ranks above the exclusive Carmel-by-the-Sea enclave where the median listing price is $3 million. An\nempty patch of seaside land\nin Carmel-by-the-Sea grabbed local attention when it hit the market in June for just $100,000, but building on the property is prohibited.\nBoth Pebble Beach and Carmel-by-the-Sea are part of Del Monte Forest, the most expensive area in Monterey County. Across the county, listings averaged about $1.3 million in June; by contrast, the median listing price in Santa Clara County, the capital of Silicon Valley, was $1.5 million in June. Sales there closed at a median price of $1.7 million.\nElsewhere in Pebble Beach, other high-end properties are on the market including a four-bedroom for $13.3 million, a five-bedroom for $15 million and an eight-bedroom estate for $29 million, per the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Manhattan rental market is hotter than ever. Again.\nThe median rent for a brokered Manhattan apartment reached $4,700 in July, a 9.3 percent change from a year earlier, according to the newest report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. It\u2019s a new record for the borough, the fifth in the last six months.\nThe record prices come amid a mayoral race that has been notably focused on housing affordability. Frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo blast each other not only on their housing plans but also on their\npersonal living situations\n, no reprieve from high rents is expected to turn voters\u2019 attentions elsewhere.\n\u201cEven if rents stop their ascent, there certainly won\u2019t be a quick pivot to affordability,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, author of the report.\nThe record prices began in February, unusual timing for the city where rents peak in summer. But mortgage rates have put pressure on the sales market, prompting some would-be buyers to wait it out in the rental market, Miller said. Interest rate cuts, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for this week, could relieve some of that pressure.\nBut elevated demand is also carrying the market to record highs. At Fetner Properties, which advertises luxury high-rise buildings, leadership estimates they\u2019ve raised rents an average of 5 or 6 percent across the portfolio in the past year while also updating amenity packages.\n\n\u201cThe rents are spectacular,\u201d said Hal Fetner, president and CEO. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of new supply coming into the market and then there\u2019s an insatiable demand of professionals who are continuing to look for units.\u201d\nManhattan, Brooklyn and Northwest Queens all saw record highs in the share of apartments subject to bidding wars, 29 percent in Manhattan, 36 percent in Brooklyn, and 27 percent in Queens.\nIn Manhattan, the rise in prices is primarily driven by studios and one-bedrooms, Miller said. The vacancy rate in the borough was 2.45 percent. Apartments were on the market for an average of 28 days, down from 32 last July.\nThe FARE Act, which went into effect in June, is also likely to be pushing up rents, at least slightly. The law prohibits brokers from charging fees to tenants who didn\u2019t hire them. If landlords pay for brokers themselves, they\u2019re likely to try to recoup that cost through higher prices.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn rose to the second-highest on record, at $3,850 for a brokered apartment. That was a 7 percent change from last July. Listing inventory fell 7 percent year over year.\nIn Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, median rent was $3,750, a nearly 9 percent increase year-over-year.\n",

        "content": "Private credit firm Favo Capital bought a 277-unit apartment tower facing Young Circle in Hollywood for $190 million.\nThe deal marks one of the priciest multifamily investment sales so far this year in South Florida.\nLauderhill-based Favo bought the 22-story 1818 Park apartment building with ground-floor retail at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal, according to a Favo news release. Seller GCF Development, a Hollywood-based firm led by Charles \u201cChip\u201d Abele, obtained a long-term equity stake in Favo as part of the deal.\nGCF completed 1818 Park in 2022 after\nyearslong delays\ndue to litigation, the Great Recession and permitting issues. An entity led by\nAbele\nfirst bought the site for $3.5 million in 2009, and sold it to another Abele-led entity in 2022 for $65.6 million, records show.\n1818 Park consists of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, according to its website. Monthly rents range from $1,640 to $3,738.\n\nFavo, led by Vincent Napolitano, provides alternative revenue-based funding to small and medium-sized businesses nationwide, the release says.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nmarket has\ncalmed\nfrom the boom of recent years that was fueled by an influx of out-of-staters, unprecedented apartment demand, record rent growth and a flurry of investment sales. Over the past two years, elevated interest rates and inflation have curbed deal activity, while rents have slightly declined due to a supply overhang.\nIn June, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega paid\n$165 million\nfor the 44-story, 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nThis month, Fort Worth, Texas-based Olympus Property paid\n$45.9 million\nfor a nine-story, 132-unit apartment complex at 1420 Northwest 15th Avenue in Miami\u2019s Allapattah. Also, Aventura-based Category Five Real Estate bought a 184-unit multifamily portfolio in Sunrise consisting of 26 one-story and two-story buildings for\n$32.3 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A new Porsche dealership in Pasadena has been given the green light after some design changes.\nThe city\u2019s Design Commission voted unanimously to approve the final design for Rusnak Auto Group\u2019s\nnew Porsche dealership\nat 2915 East Colorado Boulevard,\nPasadena Now\nreported.\nThe approved plans call for a 61,370-square-foot sales and service facility with a 4,864-square-foot automated car wash, as well as an attached public art plaza. But developers must meet four conditions addressing accessibility, lighting, building materials and environmental concerns in order to move forward.\nCommissioners instructed the development team, composed of applicant Rusnak/Pasadena and architect Goree Whitfield, to revise the Colorado Boulevard frontage to ensure people of all abilities can enter the plaza via the same path, thereby eliminating a separate accessible route.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a much more elegant solution where you don\u2019t actually separate people with different abilities,\u201d Commissioner Srinivas Rao said, per Pasadena Now.\nCity zoning rules restricting upward-facing lighting also require the developer to create a glare-reducing lighting plan for the sides and rear of the building. \u201cThe zoning code does have requirements for shielding and downlight,\u201d Pasadena Principal Planner Kevin Johnson pointed out.\n\nIn addition, the team will have to lighten the color of the brick used on large wall areas to prevent a uniform monolithic exterior and to create contrast with the aluminum composite panels on the building. Officials said the current plan for dark brick might be an eyesore to pedestrians and took away from the visual warmth common in Pasadena.\nThe team will also have to adhere to the tweaked plans for the ground of the plaza. The applicant proposed using\u00a0 artificial turf \u201cpods\u201d beneath the public art installation in place of previously proposed \u201cturf block\u201d plantings due to maintenance issues under parked cars.\nPlanning Commission Chair Julianna Delgado wants the team to steer clear of synthetic turf entirely, citing its fossil fuel origins, heat-island effects and water-use implications. The commission is requiring a sustainability review of the proposed material and comparison with greener alternatives in order to advance.\nThe historic Swanson &amp; Peterson Furniture Factory building on the new site is not eligible for historic designation, according to city staff. While the owner plans to keep the structure, any major alterations would trigger additional design review by the city.\nNow that the dealership design has been approved, the project will have to secure building permits and a plan check, whereby officials verify compliance with both interdepartmental and commission-imposed conditions.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York State decided not to collect millions in fines from Greenland USA for blowing past affordable housing deadlines at the long-delayed Atlantic Yards redevelopment after the developer threatened to sue if the state tried.\nThe Chinese firm was supposed to deliver nearly 900 affordable units by the end of May under a 2014 settlement, or face $1.75 million in monthly penalties \u2014 $2,000 per incomplete unit. But 11 years later, Greenland hasn\u2019t even broken ground on the railyard platform where many of those apartments were planned, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nInstead, Empire State Development officials told a local task force earlier this month that the fines \u2014 earmarked for a city affordable housing trust fund \u2014 won\u2019t accrue and won\u2019t be collected. The fund could have topped $5.25 million by now.\nGreenland, which defaulted on a $350 million investor loan in 2023, has cited \u201cunavoidable delays,\u201d including lack of subsidies and slow MTA approvals, as reasons for missing deadlines. ESD says it disputes those claims but acknowledged the company\u2019s warning that any attempt to collect penalties would trigger litigation and stall the project further.\nFirst pitched in 2003, Atlantic Yards \u2014 rebranded Pacific Park \u2014 was supposed to deliver 2,250 affordable apartments alongside market-rate housing, offices and the Barclays Center. To date, 1,374 affordable units have been built and the railyard platform remains a vacant promise.\n\nThe state expects to approve a transfer of development rights next month to a joint venture involving Cirrus Real Estate Partners,\nLCOR\nand Greenland. The revised plan folds in nearby retail parcels, including a shuttered Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son; Greenland will retain partial control despite failing to meet its obligations.\nThe no-fines move has enraged some community leaders, who say the state is bailing out a developer that seized land through eminent domain and then failed to deliver.\nAssemblymember Jo Ann Simon called Greenland\u2019s lawsuit threat \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you consider defaulting on your debt as an unavoidable delay, that\u2019s an argument, but it\u2019s a stretch to hang it on ESD.\u201d\nOthers, including former city housing official and consultant Jordan Barowitz, said the threat is an unsurprising developer tactic and that piling on fines could make a financially shaky project even less likely to get built.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The identity of the buyer was not disclosed. The deal works out to about $500 per square foot.\nGiuliani listed his co-op almost exactly two years ago,\nseeking $6.5 million\n. He purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002.\nHis estranged wife Judith reportedly lived in the unit until May 2019. Rudy held on to the co-op after the couple divorced, but Judith received their home in Water Mill, which she then\nsold\nin 2021 for $5 million.\nUnfortunately for Rudy, Judith\u2019s name was still on the deed as he sought to sell the apartment before he bought her out last month for $2.5 million.\nThe 10,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit includes a wood-burning fireplace, a semi-private elevator landing and location just over a block away from Central Park.\n\nThe last asking price for the unit was $5.2 million when the co-op was put back on the market in March. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman had the initial listing, but it\u2019s unclear who was marketing the property at the time of the sale.\nBetween the 2023 listing and the sale, Giuliani almost\nlost the apartment\n. He was ordered to surrender the unit as part of a $146 million judgment for the alleged defamation of two Georgia poll workers in 2020, when the former mayor pushed the false narrative that the presidential vote was rigged against Trump.\nGiuliani ultimately retained possession of the unit after reaching an undisclosed settlement with the poll workers.

This week, Doronin\u2019s OKO and Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries announced the start of vertical construction at the oceanfront construction site at 3425 Collins Avenue.\nThe financing adds to the more than\n$277 million in debt\nprovided by Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK in 2020 and 2023.\nA spokesperson for OKO said the mezzanine loan \u201creflects OKO Group\u2019s ability to secure strategic financing and to position the project for continued momentum as we move through key construction milestones.\u201d\nThe condo component of the project, previously expected to be completed in 2024 and more recently, in 2026, is now expected to be completed in 2027, according to a press release. Complicated site work has held up vertical construction.\nThe general contractor, Suffolk Construction, is working to complete one floor every two weeks now that the foundation is completed, following \u201cextensive below-grade piling, excavation work and construction,\u201d according to the release. The work included building a two-story underground parking garage via deep soil and triple soil mixing.\n\nUnderground parking, especially on the oceanfront, is complex and expensive to develop.\nThe condo portion has been fully presold for years. The project will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in a new 18-story building and the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure, which is currently a shell. The condo tower was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Jean-Michel Gathy of Denniston, who has designed hotels for Aman, Four Seasons, Cheval Blanc and St. Regis, is designing restoration and redevelopment of the Versailles Hotel.\nThe condo portion sold out in 2021 for an average price of $5,000 per square foot, according to OKO\u2019s spokesperson. The blended price per square foot marked a record at the time, but penthouses at existing and planned oceanfront condo projects now surpass that. In late July, a penthouse at Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club sold for\n$6,700 per square foot\n, or a total price of $38.2 million. A penthouse at Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge-branded Shore Club development in Miami Beach is in contract to sell for more than\n$11,000 per square foot\n.\nAman Miami Beach\nmarks the next phase within the Faena District in Miami Beach, and the first Aman property in Florida. Doronin is chairman and CEO of the Switzerland-based ultra-luxury hospitality group.\nThe condo and hotel project sits next to Faena House, a luxury condo building completed in 2015 that attracted billionaire buyers who included hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and Jamie Dinan. Backed by Blavatnik, Alan Faena developed Faena House, Faena Hotel and Faena Forum. He planned to develop the Versailles site, but that project was canceled in 2016 due to the condo market slowdown. Doronin joined Blavatnik in 2020.\u00a0Even though Aman Miami Beach sold out early in the pandemic, the project is part of a wave of ultra-luxury condo and boutique hotel developments planned on the oceanfront on Collins Avenue, including the Shore Club and the Raleigh farther south. While Witkoff\u2019s Shore Club has been performing well, developer Michael Shvo could lose the\nRaleigh to Nahla Capital\n.\n",

        "content": "A 1,000-home master-planned community is coming to rural Fort Bend County, sprawling the greater Houston metro area out 7 miles west of Rosenberg.\nThe 359-acre community dubbed Holly Ridge is being developed in a partnership between developer Signorelli Company, a Woodlands-based firm led by CEO Danny Signorelli, and Texas-based homebuilding giant D.R. Horton, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nPrices will range from about $300,000 to $450,000, with floor plans spanning 1,200 to 3,000 square feet. The Houston area\u2019s median home price was $349,950 in July, according to Redfin.\nThe community will be built in phases, and sales for the first 410 homes is anticipated to begin in the first half of next year. About a third of the land area \u2014 133 acres \u2014 will be set aside for outdoor amenities, such as a community pool, pavilion, playgrounds, sports fields and walking trails.\nHolly Ridge is one of the latest examples of Houston-area developers setting their sights on the metro\u2019s outer fringes.\n\nGreater Houston is one of the biggest markets in the country for master-planned community development. Home sales in such communities slid in the past year, on trend with the wider home-buying market. New home sales in the country\u2019s top master-planned communities\ndropped nearly 7 percent\nfrom June 2024 to June 2025, according to real estate consultant RCLCO.\nSignorelli is also developing a 4,700-acre development in Rosenberg called\nAustin Point\n, which it started in 2023, and model home construction began in June. That development includes 14,000 home lots, along with 15 million square feet of multifamily, office, retail and hospitality space.\nAlso in Rosenberg, Houston-based developer Hines began building the 2,500-home Brookewater community last year, and\nelsewhere\nin Fort Bend County, it bought 3,000 acres east of\nFulshear\nin the northeast part of the county for a 7,000 home community.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A penthouse with a private rooftop hot tub has set a record for the priciest condo sale in Greenpoint.\nThe top-floor duplex at 524 Manhattan Avenue sold for $5.975 million in an off-market deal, a surprise entrant into a neighborhood that has thus far been dominated by new development sales at the top of the market.\nChubet previously listed the apartment for $8 million in 2022 before taking it off the market at the start of 2024. He said he had since listed it as a Compass Private Exclusive, before receiving a call from Jones, who had been checking in on delisted apartments that fit his client\u2019s requirements.\nThe sale unseats a penthouse unit at Quadrum Global\u2019s The Huron on 29 Huron Street\nthat sold for $5.7 million\n, or roughly $2,400 per square foot, last October.\nIt would have had a claim as the most expensive deal in Greenpoint, if not for a two-family home at\n111 Noble Street\nthat closed for $6.9 million in July. The all-cash buyer paid roughly $1,200 per square foot for the roughly 6,000-square-foot home.\nIn North Brooklyn, the median price of homes sold rose 6 percent year-over-year to $1.46 million, but the average price per square foot fell 2 percent to $1,483, according to Corcoran\u2019s second quarter market report.\nThe 1,780-square-foot home overlooking McCarren Park comes with two primary bedrooms, three bathrooms and an additional 680 exterior square feet. The deal comes out to over $3,300 per interior square foot.\nThe seller underwent a $2 million renovation that involved receiving board and city approval to create a recreational rooftop with a private hot tub, according to Compass\u2019 John Chubet, who had the listing.\n\nThe seller bought the home for $1.9 million in 2019, according to public records. The seller is an LLC tied to Ronen Segev, who sells pre-owned Steinway Pianos through his business Park Avenue Pianos.\nA keyed elevator opens into the triple-height great room, which opens up to the eat-in kitchen.\nThe top-floor home has floor-to-ceiling windows in the great room, along with one of the three terraces. Both of the primary bedrooms, one of which is on the second floor accessed by a staircase off the living area, also have terraces.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the 57th Street Billionaires\u2019 Row views,\u201d Chubet said. \u201cThis one\u2019s different, in that it\u2019s more bespoke \u2014 it\u2019s uniquely Brooklyn.\u201d\nThe roof terrace features a custom western cedar round hot tub, outdoor kitchen and a heated cabana with a retractable roof.\nNest Seekers\u2019 Cornell Jones brought the buyer, who he said had been renting another unit on McCarren Park and was looking for a multi-floor unit in the area with outdoor space.\nAfter initially touring the home in February, Jones\u2019 client had concerns about the closet space, but ultimately returned to the unit after touring other potential options.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful apartment, there\u2019s not anything like it,\u201d Jones said.\n",

The company, founded last year, is planning to relocate its San Francisco headquarters, currently spanning 3,400 square feet at 375 Alabama Street in the Mission District.\nResolve\u2019s new offices will be in the south building of the two-building 350 Rhode Island complex.\nPCCP\nowns the south building, previously home to the headquarters of internet-of-things company Samsara, which\nmoved to South of Market in 2019\nand began\nleasing all of the One De Haro building in 2021\n.\nResolve has increased its headcount significantly over the past year, according to the Business Times. It\u2019s the latest AI company to pick up office space in San Francisco, though its latest lease stands out as the majority of AI leases are for less than 10,000 square feet of space, per JLL.\n\nLast month, AI robotics startup\nSkild AI\ninked a notable office lease of its own in the Bay Area, grabbing nearly 32,500 square feet at 970 Park Place in San Mateo. The month before that, AI startup\nGlean\n, based in Palo Alto, signed on to expand its Bay Area presence with an additional 45,000-square-foot office in San Francisco.\nThe AI sector was partially responsible for helping lower San Francisco\u2019s office vacancy rate last quarter, marking the third straight quarter it\u2019s gone down, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Times. It fell 1 percent quarter-over-over to 34.8 percent.\nAs it stands, AI firms occupy approximately 5 million square feet of offices today, though CBRE estimates that number to quadruple to 21 million square feet over the next five years. If that happens, it would effectively\ncut San Francisco\u2019s current office vacancy rate\nin half.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One Wall Street, Harry Macklowe\u2019s hulking condo conversion in the Financial District, has scored its priciest sale to date.\nUnit 3304 sold for $9.08 million, or over $3,000 per square foot, according to documents. The deal for the unit, which went into contract with a last asking price of $9.75 million, marks the most expensive residential sale since October 2022.\nThe sale is the neighborhood\u2019s most expensive since a unit at Time Equities\u2019 50 West Street fetched $12 million in October 2022.\nThe deal also marks a bright spot for the massive condo conversion that has otherwise\nmade headlines for the deals it hasn\u2019t done\n. But after averaging fewer than three contracts per month since sales launched in 2021, the building netted seven deals in July.\nAnd after selling just two, three-bedroom units, the project has added four contracts for homes of the same size to its tally this year.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Richard Rothbloom brought the buyer.\nSpanning almost 3,000 square feet, Unit 3304 has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The home came furnished by Brazilian furniture house Artefacto, one of four units the building has put up for sale as move-in ready. Another turnkey unit went into contract at the end of July, asking $3.5 million.\nRothbloom said the buyer, who already lived in the neighborhood and won\u2019t be keeping the furniture in the unit, gravitated to the building because of its amenity package compared to other projects in the area.\nThe corner unit has harbor and Hudson River views, along with a 1,400 square-foot wraparound terrace.\nThe building is seeking to attract a different clientele than the young renters and deal-seekers who have historically populated the area, dangling amenities like a private restaurant, 75-foot pool on the 38th floor and complimentary membership to the Life Time fitness club in the building.\n\nDespite the small signs of progress, the sales finish line is still a ways off. One Wall has sold just a quarter of its units, and no units above the 33rd floor in the 49-story building.\nMacklowe is seeking nearly $2,500 per square foot on average for the units in the building, with many of the top-floor units asking over $3,000 per square foot, according to Marketproof. The average price per square foot in the Financial District was just over $1,400, according to Corcoran\u2019s second quarter market report.\nSales are being handled by an in-house team that includes former Douglas Elliman brokers Lenny Inzirillo and Jacob Franco, who\ntook over from Compass in May 2024\n. Macklowe Properties\u2019 Anna Zarro and Matthew Chook are overseeing the in-house sales approach.\nThe sales team has dropped prices on a number of units this year, with drastic discounts in some cases. A 28th-floor unit hit the market at the end of January asking $3.9 million, down from its original asking price of $5.8 million in the original offering plan.\n\u201cThere are buyers out there purchasing, [the home] just needs to be in the correct [price] range,\u201d Rothbloom said.\nThe property is also\nfacing increased competition in the neighborhood\u2019s luxury offerings\n.\nBizzi &amp; Partners, Bilgili Holdings and Fortress Investment Group\u2019s project at 125 Greenwich began closings earlier this year, while Trinity Place Holdings\u2019 77 Greenwich has slowly marched towards sellout on its 89 units.\nThose two buildings and One Wall Street have been FiDi\u2019s best-selling condos the last three months, according to Marketproof, led by 125 Greenwich\u2019s average of seven deals per month in the last three months.\nThis year, a penthouse at 130 William Street sold for $7.7 million in February, or just over $3,000 per square foot, according to public records. That unit originally sold for $7.36 million in 2021 before hitting the market again for almost $9 million in 2023.\nThe most expensive sponsor sale this year was another penthouse at 130 William, which sold for almost $7.1 million, or $2,860 per square foot.\n",

To date, 205 certificates of occupancy for single-family residences have been granted.\nIn the case of this year\u2019s Palisades Fire that claimed 700 homes in Malibu, a single plan check \u2013 the last step before a building permit is issued \u2013 has been approved, according to city data. Another seven have been submitted and are under review. No permits have been issued.\nNow, the city is scrambling for another recovery blueprint to bounce back from January\u2019s Palisades Fire even as it works its way through ordinances, zoning mazes and deadlines to navigate fallout from the 2018 blaze. For real estate agents on the ground, recovery through the lens of dealmaking has begun to ramp over the past month.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already started working with buyers who are, I think, going to be a part of the recovery story and that\u2019s very exciting to see because there\u2019s always a period of time, or at least what we experienced after Woolsey, where the sentiment was fairly negative for a bit,\u201d said Grether, who is founding partner of Compass\u2019 Malibu office and helms the Grether Group.\nHe\u2019s not the only one seeing the turn.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Cooper Mount, who specializes in Malibu and grew up there, also noted\nbusiness picking up\nover the past four weeks, particularly on Carbon and La Costa beaches, where deals have been closing at anywhere from $5 million for a single lot to $14 million for one-and-a-half to two lots.\nAt the top of this year\u2019s burned lot sales was a property with 60 feet fronting the ocean on Carbon Beach, also known as Billionaire\u2019s Beach. The roughly 12,600-square-foot plot at 22102 Pacific Coast Highway traded for $14 million last Tuesday.\nAmong this year\u2019s five largest lot sales in Malibu, the least expensive trade was for a 6,600-square-foot piece of La Costa Beach land at 21360 Pacific Coast Highway, which sold for $5.1 million last Wednesday.\nAs interest percolates among buyers, people are seeing a way into a highly coveted community with a finite amount of oceanfront property.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any dive in desirability,\u201d Mount said of what\u2019s to come for Malibu real estate. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible place and there\u2019s only so much beach available. There\u2019s only one front row.\u201d\nAnother view\nAn overseas buyer apparently got that memo.\n\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe represented that buyer on the purchase of eight lots on La Costa Beach and one on Carbon Beach, totaling roughly\n$65 million\n.\nThe duo declined to provide additional details on the buyer, but said rebuilding is the intent. Their client has built the back-end infrastructure to do that as efficiently as possible with an in-house consulting team of architects and expeditors.\nNews of the deals was received in some corners with mistrust of a single buyer scooping up multiple lots. Those who understand the regulatory environment and what goes into the building process hold a different view.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, we\u2019re lucky to have somebody like this purchasing these lots and taking the time to rebuild,\u201d Howe said.\nThe process will be a long one as many have seen with the Woolsey Fire recovery.\nIn Malibu, particularly on the beach, building is tough and pricey.\nAnywhere from $2 million to $3 million has to be shelled out pre-construction for infrastructure such as a septic system, seawall barrier protecting properties from waves and flooding and foundational caissons to support homes on the sand. Having the stomach and capital to see those projects through isn\u2019t for everyone. Some who want the community to bounce back quickly, see\neconomies of scale\nand multi-lot deals as one way of moving forward.\n\u201cTheir ultimate goal is to make Malibu not only what it used to be but an even better place,\u201d Littlefield said of his and Howe\u2019s client buying multiple lots. \u201cThey\u2019re going to basically make the best houses on the best beach and make this place great again. They\u2019re just super excited to be at the forefront and they ultimately are going to make this place awesome.\u201d\nPrice creep\nPrices will no doubt rise in a place that\u2019s already\nexpensive to build\n.\n\u201cIf you think prices are high now, it\u2019s going to be more expensive because all the new rules, regulations and inflation is going to make this already premier beachfront even more premiere and expensive,\u201d said Beverly Hills Estates co-founder Branden Williams.\nVideo of Williams, who lives on La Costa Beach, putting out the flames at his home back in January and saving it from destruction has been widely circulated.\nAs a resident, he\u2019s looking at rebuilding from a pragmatic standpoint.\n\u201cMost of these houses needed to be torn down anyways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were little beach shacks from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. A lot of the foundations needed to be redone. They were on little sticks.\u201d\nMany are simply waiting to see what shakes out from local government when it comes to ordinances and infrastructure, in a bid to time construction as close as possible to when those decisions are complete. In other cases, more homeowners\u2019 lots may trickle into the for-sale market as some ultimately decide rebuilding isn\u2019t for them.\nGrether\u2019s wife grew up in Malibu and the couple are now raising their two children there, They welcome \u201csigns of life\u201d that he says are starting to peek through as people return to the city. Unlike other areas burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires, Malibu sat isolated with the closure of Pacific Coast Highway earlier this year.\n\u201cThere is a positivity that is starting to occur, which did not exist previously,\u201d Grether said. \u201cThere were definitely some dark moments after the fire, where it was hard to be super positive, selling the lifestyle-type mentality when it was very dire, so it\u2019s been nice to see that sort of mentality shift.\u201d",

        "content": "Waterfront property in Lake Geneva rarely hits the market, something that prompted a buyer in Lake Geneva to make an offer for a property that wasn\u2019t for sale, and it worked.\nThe 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom home on 1 acre in the South Shore Club development at Lake Geneva sold for $10.1 million this week to a buyer who presented an offer, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The price works out to $1,442 per square foot.\nThe home, at N1626 Lakeside Court, is on the southern shore near the lake just off South Lake Shore Drive. The sale is the second-highest priced home sold in the Wisconsin lakefront area. In June a home sold for almost double. A 5-acre, 10,800-square-foot home at\nW3806 Lackey Lane\nfor $20 million, or $1,852 per square foot.\nDaniel Hodgman of Coldwell Banker represented the buyers and said that they spent two years searching for a home on the lake and had begun networking in the area to see if anyone was willing to sell. Hans Melges of Melges Real Estate represented the sellers, George and Antoinette Flaherty. Melges said they had been considering selling in a few years but the offer pushed forward their decision.\n\nSouth Shore Club is a 38-home development built on the former campus of the Northwestern Military Academy. The homes do not sit directly on the lake but are positioned near the club\u2019s 1,500 feet of lakefront. The club owners association keeps piers and boats for common use among residents, maintained by staff.\nBuilt in 2005, the home was purchased by the Flahertys in 2013. The home features stone walls with built-in staircases, a semi-hidden spiral staircase and other castle-like aesthetic features.\nResidential properties on Lake Geneva have sold in the double-digit millions range in recent years. The historic Aloha Lodge sold last year for $22 million. A\nhome sold\nfor $17 million in 2023 only to be torn down, and in 2022, the estate of Richard Driehaus sold for\n$36 million\nto J. Christopher Reyes and Anna Reyes of Reyes Holdings.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "MetroNational bought a 15-story Houston office tower that was formerly the headquarters of Marathon Oil this week.\nThe 442,000-square-foot tower, at 990 Town and Country Boulevard, is in West Houston along the Katy Freeway Sam Houston Tollway. MetroNational represented itself in the acquisition, the Houston Business Journal r\neported\n.\nConocoPhillips was the seller, represented by JLL\u2019s Jeff Cairns, Brandon Clarke, Sanford Criner, Rick Goings and Kevin McConn. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The building\u2019s taxable value is $164.7 million, according to the Harris Central Appraisal District.\nThe building sits on 3.4 acres and was designed by Houston-based architecture firm Munoz + Albin. It was built in 2022. The Katy Freeway East submarket was attractive due to its single-digit vacancy rates and strong tenant demand in the area, MetroNational said.\nThe firm cited a trend of major employers moving west of downtown following residential population trends, adding that the corridor is one of the most active office markets in the nation.\n\nMarathon Oil exited the tower last year when the company was acquired by ConocoPhillips for $22.5 billion.\nThe acquisition is the latest in a series of recent major real estate moves by MetroNational. It is partnering with Radom Capital, also a Houston-based developer, to transform a 35,000-square-foot warehouse at 1085 Gessner Road into a\nmixed-use hub called Greenside\n, which is in the same area. Plans for that project include 15 small retail spaces, along with office and restaurant space, plus a 1-acre park with a jogging trail and pedestrian paths that connect to nearby retail. Construction is expected to wrap up next year.\nMetroNational is also redeveloping a former Sears site into a 27-acre mixed-use project called\nMemorial Town Square\n. In 2022, the company revived pandemic-postponed plans to a 190,000-square-foot, nine-story\noffice building\nin Memorial City as well. That project wrapped up in 2023.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Scott Rechler closed his\n$1 billion deal\nfor 590 Madison Avenue with a big private equity loan, marking New York City\u2019s largest investment sale in three years.\nMark Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management provided $785 million in debt to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of the Plaza District office tower from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cThis is one of the highest quality buildings in Manhattan with one of the best locations at 57th Street and Madison,\u201d Rechler said. \u201cWith institutions seeking to shed their exposure to office, we view this as a great time to be investing.\u201d\nRXR partnered with Elliott Investment Management on the deal, which closed Thursday.\nThe closing wasn\u2019t without its hiccups.\nRechler signed a contract to buy the building in May, with a closing deadline set for July 31. But RXR needed more time to lock in its financing and got a two-week extension, for which the company had to pay a $5 million fee that was tacked onto the final purchase price.\nRechler said the delay was the result of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in early April unsettling financial markets. He had been negotiating late into the process with Cale Street Partners, a privately held real estate finance firm based in the U.K. and backed by the Kuwait Investment Authority.\nBut RXR ultimately pivoted to Apollo, which earlier this year provided a $575 million loan for the company\u2019s conversion of the 5 Times Square office building into nearly 1,000 apartments. It\u2019s possible that Cale Street could take a piece of the financing deal at a later date.\nThe final debt package is broken down into a $650 million senior loan, a $135 million mezzanine loan and about $60 million in future funding commitments for things like tenant improvements and leasing costs.\nAn Eastdil Secured team led by Will Silverman and Gary Phillips negotiated the sale. Eastdil\u2019s Grant Frankel arranged the debt.\n\nIn the past year, Ohio Teachers signed about 300,000 square feet of leases at the tower \u2014 including a\n100,000 square foot deal with Apollo\nin April \u2014 and Rechler said he\u2019s already got leases out with new tenants for space in the building.\nSome have described the 43-story, 1 million-square-foot property as a B building in an A+ location.\nThe tower was completed in 1983 and shows its age with challenging design features like relatively low ceilings and heating/cooling infrastructure along the outside walls, limiting the amount of exposed window space.\nRechler said the building\u2019s setbacks mitigate some of those challenges and provide enough light and air. He said 590 Madison is \u201cclearly digital\u201d in his paradigm of high-quality \u201cdigital\u201d office buildings versus outdated \u201cfilm\u201d ones.\nRXR plans to renovate the building\u2019s atrium area, and there\u2019s also some potential upside in the retail space, which is currently occupied by the luxury watch seller Tourneau. Retail properties in the area have been bolstered recently by luxury brands like Gucci, Prada and Akris buying spaces on Fifth and Madison avenues.\nRechler said he\u2019s in talks with LMVH, which is also an office tenant at 590, about the building\u2019s retail.\nIt\u2019s been a long road to get to this point.\nRechler said he first took a look at 590 Madison in 1993 when he was working with Odyssey Investment Partners, which teamed up with Ohio Teachers to purchase the building. He made an offer on the tower in 2018 when the sellers put it up for sale, and then made an unsolicited offer sometime in the past two years or so.\nRechler said each offer was roughly in the same area as the $1.08 billion he ultimately paid.\n\u201cPart of the challenge with a lot of these groups and where it becomes interesting is you\u2019ve had these buildings valued at a certain level and it\u2019s hard to sell until that comes down to a level that clears the market,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are opportunities today with a lot of institutions where office valuations have dropped and they\u2019re marking their positions down to reasonable enough levels where it becomes compelling.\u201d\n",

The other development is The Karlyn, a 159-unit complex for tenants who are 55 and older at 7576 Immokalee Road.\n\nIn October, the Collier County Commission voted 4-1 to rezone the 5.9-acre site where Vintana at Vanderbilt is planned.

The Italian investors purchased it about six years earlier for around $34 million.\nThe clock tower, a local landmark constructed in the late 1920s that looks to the Pacific Ocean, has seen its occupancy and net operating income crash. Occupancy declined to 43 percent in March this year compared to 100 percent at loan underwriting ten years ago; income dropped to about $144,000 from $2.2 million during the same period, the latest Morningstar data revealed. It has a debt service coverage ratio of 0.38x, so the property is not bringing in enough money to pay off debts.\nSanta Monica has a 24 percent office\nvacancy rate\n, which isn\u2019t much higher than all of West Los Angeles, which has a 22 percent vacancy rate. But it is much higher than Century City\u2019s 12.8 percent.

        "content": "Midtown South is officially getting a makeover.\nCity Council on Thursday unanimously approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, which rezones 42 blocks in the Midtown neighborhood for housing development. The rezoning is expected to net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 set aside as affordable, making it the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are facing a city-wide housing crisis,\u201d said Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. \u201cWe must confront it by advancing housing solutions and creating more homes with a focus on affordability.\u201d\nThe rezoning creates two new high-density residential\ndistricts\nthat require Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and also allow for the construction of housing projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. This is the first time that these new districts have been used, after the state lifted the city\u2019s long-standing cap on residential floor area ratio of 12.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unlocking a pent-up demand for residential use, both new residential buildings and conversion of existing office buildings,\u201d said Jeff Mulligan, Planning and Development Specialist at the law firm HSF Kramer.\nThe new districts were made possible by\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 rezoning initiative that passed last December, which enables greater residential density across the city. The units created through this Midtown rezoning are part of Eric Adams\u2019\nManhattan Plan\n, which promises 100,000 new units in the borough over the next decade.\n\u201cThis is what addressing the housing crisis means, actually producing huge amounts of affordable housing,\u201d said local Council member Erik Bottcher.\n\nThe rezoning affects four separate areas of Midtown South, bounded by 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Eighth Avenue to the west. The areas were previously zoned for manufacturing use, and either barred housing construction or limited it considerably.\nIt also includes $325 million in planned upgrades along 21 blocks of Broadway, including a car-free busway on 34th Street, and the Adams administration pledged $121.9 million for programs dedicated to helping decades-old garment businesses in the area.\n\u201cTo get to a place where we can save and invest in the fashion industry, expand our transportation options, address the commercial vacancy crisis and address all the different hurdles, utilize new state allowances to build more density in places like Midtown, to me that is a success,\u201d said Council member Keith Powers.\nThe approval comes after the City Council\u2019s Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises\ntweaked\nthe original proposal last week. The redevelopment will now net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 affordable, down from the 9,676 units initially expected, of which 2,890 would be affordable.\nAmong other changes, City Council lowered the allowable residential density in a four-block area in the southeast section of the rezoning, between 23rd and 27th streets, reducing the maximum FAR from 18 to 15. It also scrapped a proposed high-density residential designation for a midblock stretch between West 36th and 40th streets, from Seventh to Eighth avenues, following concern from local businesses in the garment district that they would be forced out to make way for new development.\nThe success of this rezoning initiative is a major win for City of Yes, and may help pave the way for future rezonings in other high-density areas. The proposal now goes to the Mayor\u2019s office for final review and approval.\n",

An affiliate of roofing supply company ABC Supply sold the site.\nThe property consists of a 33,700-square-foot warehouse built in 1982, as well as six vacant lots, records show. It\u2019s adjacent to an inactive FEC Railway spur and to the 150-unit Victory Homes public housing complex at 520 Northwest 75th Street.\nSwerdlow plans to develop\n5,730 below-market rentals\n; 370,000 square feet of commercial space; 250,000 square feet of open space and amenities; and a new Tri-Rail passenger train station across five existing Miami-Dade County public housing complexes in Little River. SJM Partners and Alben Duffie are development partners.\nIn addition to Victory Homes, the complexes Swerdlow will redevelop are Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court; Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court; Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court; and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue. They have a combined 314 units.\n\nIn April, county commissioners approved for Swerdlow to redevelop the properties and lease the county-owned sites under a\n99-year term\n. The lease will yield $9.6 billion to Miami-Dade over the 99-year term.\nMiami-Dade records show that the 7275 and 7373 Northwest Seventh Avenue property Swerdlow just purchased, called the ABC Property, is part of the development site.\nCurrent residents at the public housing communities will be able to move into the new buildings Swerdlow develops. The firm will replace the existing 314 units through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Rental Assistance Demonstration program.\nOther units at the project could be apartments for rent or for-sale homes, county records show.\nSwerdlow\u2019s Little River project is part of a bigger Miami-Dade initiative to redevelop its aging public housing. In 2023, the county issued a solicitation to redevelop a total of 10 low-income housing complexes.\nElsewhere in Miami-Dade, Miami Beach-based Redwood Dev Co plans to replace a portion of Annie Coleman 14 public housing site at 2415-2479 and 2494 Northwest 50th Street and 2600 Northwest 48th Street\u00a0 with\n287 affordable units\n, 36 townhouses and 4,800 square feet of retail. Annie Coleman 14 is in an unincorporated area of the county. Redwood also plans to redevelop the Gwen Cherry 07 public housing complex with 150 affordable units reserved for renters 62 and older, and the Lemon City public housing complex with 260 affordable apartments. The properties are at 170 Northeast 67th Street, 6850 and 6860 Northeast Second Avenue, and 185, 147 and 137 Northeast 68th Terrace in Miami.\n",

The six-acre property at 10950 Washington Boulevard has been empty since the NFL\u2019s media operations\nrelocated to Hollywood Park\nnear SoFi Stadium in Inglewood four years ago.\nHudson is looking to turn part of the property into a mixed-use development with housing and commercial uses, according to Urbanize. NFL Media\nterminated its lease\nat the site in 2022.\nUnder the proposal, Hudson would redevelop two five-story buildings to include a total of 508 apartments, 14,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, and parking for 715 vehicles. The project, designed by KFA Architecture, would have more than 100,000 square feet of landscaped open space, including an approximately 10,000-square-foot publicly-accessible plaza along Washington Boulevard.\nDensity bonus incentives allow the developer to build larger than what would be normally allowed at the site, provided it sets aside 79 of the apartments as deed-restricted low-income housing. In Los Angeles County, low income is generally\ndefined\nas making less than $84,850 annually for one person.\nThe SoFi Stadium area is quickly becoming a sports media hub in the country\u2019s entertainment capital.\n\nBillionaire Stan Kroenke, owner of the Los Angeles Rams and SoFi Stadium, has filed plans to build\nHollywood Park Studios\nat the 300-acre Hollywood Park retail village in Inglewood.\nThe 12-acre studio project is designed to be the International Broadcast Center for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. After the global sporting event, the studios would be available for entertainment production and operations.\nThe first phase of that development calls for five soundstages at 18,000 square feet each. An accompanying three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building would house support, production and postproduction facilities.\n\u201cThe vision for Hollywood Park has always been to build a city within a city combining media, entertainment and technology that will transform the greater Los Angeles area,\u201d Kroenke said in a\nstatement\nof the endeavor.\nThe Culver City Planning Commission is set to review Hudson Pacific\u2019s plans later this month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The ruling let that reduction stand and opened the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nNow, those same protections could shrink or disappear. The city\u2019s director of housing initiatives, Bartek Starodaj, will present the findings to the Common Council\u2019s Laws and Rules Committee next week.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments; exemptions and rehab projects have cut that to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nThe 2025 survey differed in its approach, using a \u201ctargeted sampling\u201d that excluded some large complexes like 267-unit Stony Run, which is still under ETPA after a recent state ruling.\n\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units, where vacancies are 3.73 percent \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum.\nAssemblymember Sarahana Shrestha slammed the process as \u201cabsolute nonsense,\u201d saying the 5 percent vacancy trigger fails to capture actual housing strain.\nMedian home prices in Ulster County have tripled since 2016 to $421,800, median rents have doubled to $2,000 and more than half of Kingston renters are cost-burdened.\nThe city has over 600 units in its pipeline \u2014 the most since the 1970s \u2014 and has rolled out rezoning, short-term rental caps and \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction to protect tenants, but Mayor Steve Noble says housing remains \u201ca very challenging issue.\u201d\nThe Common Council\u2019s call on whether to keep, tweak or scrap rent stabilization will be closely watched by lawmakers and activists pushing to scrap the vacancy requirement for small cities adopting ETPA.\nIf Kingston backs off, it could mark the first rollback of rent stabilization in New York.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The ruling seems likely to affect other housing projects\u00a0 that have been proposed in recent years under California\u2019s Builder\u2019s Remedy law but held up by the city.\n\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how validating it is,\u201d said Dave Rand, an attorney at Rand Pastor Nelson who represented Pustilnikov in the case that\u2019s been playing out in court since last year.\n\u201cA lot of these legal questions \u2014 they\u2019re new,\u201d Rand said. \u201cThis puts the wind at our back and sends a message clear as day. The city cannot rely on specious legal arguments to delay and deny a developer\u2019s vested rights.\u201d\nPustilnikov did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Richards Watson and Gershon\u2019s Ginetta Giovinco, who represented Beverly Hills in the litigation, did not immediately return a phone call from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Linden Drive project was one of the first proposals in Beverly Hills to exploit the legal loophole that lets builders override local planning boards when cities fail to plan for new housing as required by state law.\nState lawmakers recently enabled such standoffs by reviving the 1980s-era provision known as Builder\u2019s Remedy with a series of reforms chiseling away at the discretionary power of cities to block housing. California\u2019s 2019 Housing Crisis Act and subsequent Permit Streamlining Act both came into play in Pustilnikov\u2019s legal battle.\nThe drama began when the Ukrainian-born developer proposed replacing a five-story office building near the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards with a tower with 165 apartments and a 73-key boutique hotel.\nThe 2022 planning application hit tony Beverly Hills like a wrecking ball \u2014 and\u00a0 more soon followed.\nThe city has tried several tactics to regain control over the spate of Builder\u2019s Remedy projects. City planners, for example, rejected Pustilnikov\u2019s application and others like it on the grounds that the proposals changed too much during the review process or didn\u2019t qualify as housing projects due to mixed-use components, among other arguments.\n\n\u201cThese cases all involve the same basic questions,\u201d said Californians for Homeownership\u2019s Matt Gelfand, one of numerous lawyers involved in the yearslong effort to force Beverly Hills to follow state housing law.\nThe nonprofit firm, which is funded by the California Association of Realtors, and the California Housing Defense Fund, have both filed their own cases against the City of Beverly Hills.\nSuperior Court Judge Curtis Kin rejected all of the city\u2019s arguments in the case, but stopped short of ruling that Beverly Hills acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d which requires a higher legal bar, according to the Aug. 12 court filing.\nThe city\u2019s lawyers invoked standards that do not exist in the law and illegally subject developers to the \u201cwhims and caprice of the city,\u201d the ruling says.\n\u201cThe court is unconvinced by the city\u2019s claim that the petitions should be denied,\u201d Kin wrote.\nHe ordered Beverly Hills to reverse its previous denials of Pustilnikov\u2019s application and continue reviewing the project\u2019s plans.\nThis week\u2019s decision means that years of work will finally bear fruit, Gelfand told\nTRD\n.\nHe added that Beverly Hills may need to return to drawing board to come up with new arguments in similar cases pending over Max Netty\u2019s\n27-unit condo proposal\nat 140 South Camden Drive and a 134-unit building proposed for 8820 and 8800 Wilshire Boulevard, not to mention\nnumerous other Builder\u2019s Remedy proposals currently pending\nwith the city.\nNetty\u2019s lawyer, Holland and Knight\u2019s Ryan Leaderman, for his part agreed.\n\u201cThis is super easy,\u201d Leaderman told\nTRD\n. \u201cThe city\u2019s argument is that due to a change in the project, you have lost your vested rights to proceed as a builder\u2019s remedy project. We call \u2018b-s\u2019 on that.\u201d\n",

Meanwhile, WEA co-founder Kurt Rappaport represented the buyer.\nThe brokerage declined to comment on the deal.\nThe recently redone property first hit the market in 2023 for $72.5 million and was most recently listed in January for $56.9 million, according to listing sites.\nProperty records show the seller is a Delaware-registered limited liability company called RFG-Lavender, while the buyer is an entity called Murray Hill Real Estate LLC.\nRFG bought the home from Caruso in 2018, paying $16.7 million for it in late 2018.\n\nThe developer behind Americana at Brand and The Grove perhaps wouldn\u2019t recognize the new version from his prior residence. Caruso\u2019s former Traditional-style home counted one less bedroom and four fewer bathrooms than the contemporary abode that just traded, according to a comparison of the listings.\nComing in at over 17,000 square feet, the property has a 130-foot-long driveway, six-car garage, elevator, library and theater. The primary suite alone is 2,000 square feet with its own living room and 900-square-foot balcony.\nThe spread continues outside where there\u2019s a cabana, kitchen, pool, spa and tennis court. It\u2019s also less than a 10-minute walk away from the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard.\nThe Benedict Canyon Drive property is the third-largest on-market trade by closing price in Beverly Hills so far this year, according to records with Zillow.\nLeading the pack is\n1028 Ridgedale Drive\n, which went for $60 million in April. Rappaport represented the clients on the sell and buy side of the deal, with Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton co-listing the 12-bed, 18-bath estate.\nThe city\u2019s second-largest deal was\n942 North Alpine Drive\n, which traded for $51.8 million, also in April. The over 12,000-square-foot residence was listed by Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Carolwood\u2019s Linda May. Compass\u2019 Carl Gambino and John Bercsi represented the buyer.\n",

The price works out to $380,000 per unit.\nAbacus bought the property from Walnut Creek-based Sequoia Equities, which acquired the complex in 2018 for $117 million. At the time of that acquisition, Sequoia Equities general partner Pat Reilly said it would invest $2.5 million to modernize the apartments and shared amenities, according to Urbanize. It financed the 2018 purchase with a seven-year, $74.3 million loan originated by Walker &amp; Dunlop, which was scheduled to mature this month.\nAbacus\u2019 purchase marks the latest\nEast Bay multifamily\nproperty sold for a discount to its previous price. Earlier this year, 1889 Harrison Street and 447 17th Street in Oakland sold for roughly half their assessed values; in March, an apartment building at 2055 Center Street in Berkeley traded hands for about 40 percent of its assessed value.\n\nAbacus has been growing its presence in the Bay Area over the past year. The real estate investment firm bought the 80-unit Valencia and 64-unit Valencia Terrace apartment buildings in Vallejo last year for $27.5 million. The firm specializes in multifamily investments across the U.S. with more than $4.8 billion in investments and boasts more than 31,000 units in its portfolio.\nMeanwhile, apartment development in the Bay Area has sunk to a 15-year low, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing CoStar Group.\nSouth San Francisco\nis bucking that regional trend with three large-scale residential projects underway.\nTrammell Crow Residential recently secured a $183 million construction loan for its 480-unit Alexan Icon project at 1587 and 1588 San Mateo Avenue.

The firm\u2019s \u201ccore strategy\u201d involves identifying similar assets to purchase across the Sun Belt, she said.\nThe firm\u2019s priority is to invest in cities where it already owns properties, such as\nCharlotte\n, Dallas, Nashville, Phoenix and Tampa, and expand those portfolios, Cousins CEO Colin Connolly said.\n\nThe Link at Uptown opened in 2021 and is 94 percent leased. Out of the 292,000-square-foot building only about 6,200 square feet of space is available. JLL is handling leasing.\nDallas-based developer Kaizen Development Partners sold the building and was its developer.\nThis was Cousins\u2019 second play in the urban core of Dallas. Last fall, it paid $138 million to buy the mortgage for\nSaint Ann Court\n, an Uptown Dallas office building at 2501 North Harwood.\nElsewhere in Dallas-Fort Worth, Cousins owns a nine-story office building at 5950 Sherry Lane, a nine-story office tower in Preston Center near Sterling Plaza, and Legacy Union, a 319,000-square-foot office building in Plano.\nCousins was founded as a construction business by Tom Cousins in 1958, and it developed several iconic buildings in Atlanta\u2019s skyline.

Modlin said she has \u201cmaintained it at a high level,\u201d including painting the property and redoing the floors before listing it.\nModlin called the co-op a \u201crare gem,\u201d with every room in the apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue, Central Park or the James B. Duke Mansion, a townhouse commissioned by the tobacco heir for his wife in the early 20th century.\n\nThe 4,600-square-foot home, which was featured in\nArchitectural Digest\nin 1975, has three bedrooms and four bathrooms and features a wood-paneled library, eat-in kitchen and a private elevator. It\u2019s one of 12 units in the pre-war building, which includes private storage and full-time doormen.\nBorn Caroline Lee Radziwill, the younger sister of Jackie Onassis was an interior designer, socialite and public relations executive known for her friendships with artist Andy Warhol, writer Truman Capote, members of the Rolling Stones and designer Giorgio Armani. She was married three times, to publishing executive Michael Temple Canfield, the Polish Prince Stanislaw Radziwill and filmmaker Herbert Ross.\nRadziwill owned homes across Manhattan, London and Paris, including another Upper East Side apartment. In 2019, about eight months after her death, her 15th-floor co-op on East 72nd Street sold for\n$4.25 million\n.\nOther units in the building have traded for more modest sums, at least in the years since the city began recording deals in its online database. One co-op on the 11th and 12th floors broke with the norm in 2008, when it sold for more than $16 million. The apartment hit the market four years later with an asking price of roughly $26 million, where it endured multiple price cuts and languished for more than a decade. It sold last year for $6.5 million in what appears to be a transfer between family members for half the value of the apartment.\nA duplex on the first and second floors sold last year for $3 million. The three-bedroom apartment belonged to the late architect Henry Cobb, known for designing the Goldman Sachs headquarters in Battery Park City, who lived there with his late wife, sculptor Joan Cobb, starting in the 1960s until their deaths in 2020 and 2022, respectively.\n",

The unit measures just over 4,500 interior square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

The buildings, at\n269 Washington Avenue\nand\n238 Hall Street\nin Clinton Hill are around the corner from each other and have 10 units each. They were built in 2016. At the Hall Street property, the asking rent for a two-bedroom apartment that went off the market in July was $4,650. At the Washington Avenue building, a three-bedroom unit was listed for $6,400 in July.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nExtell\nnotched another sale at\n50 West 66th Street.

The sellers were\nGeorge and Leslie Biddle\n, who bought the home in 2010 for $3.5 million. The five-story property dates to 1910 and spans 5,300 square feet. It has four bedrooms, a garden and a built-in barbecue area. The home went on the market in March with\nLandis, Benalloul\nand\nCaroline Shalloe\n, all with Corcoran.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nForeclosures surge across U.S. cities\nForeclosure filings last month were 13 percent higher than they were at the same time last year, according to a report from real estate data firm Attom. Overall, there were more than 36,000 such filings, which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions. That means one in every 3,939 housing units had such a filing.\nAmong the most populous metropolitan areas in the U.S., three-quarters saw their foreclosure filings surge year over year, and just 14 of these regions saw foreclosure activity drop during this time. (\nThe Real Dea\nl analyzed Attom\u2019s foreclosure data for the 56 cities that have populations of at least 1 million residents.)\nNew York, the country\u2019s largest metro area, experienced a decline of about 16 percent in foreclosure activity compared to the year before. In that region, one in every 4,474 homes has a foreclosure filing.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "If the game show \u201cFamily Feud\u201d asked contestants to name \u201cthings that scare people,\u201d they might say horror movies, spiders and the dark.\nBut in progressive neighborhoods of New York City, \u201cmarket-rate condos\u201d would make the list.\nMany debates over whether to rezone for mixed-income multifamily boil down to, \u201cWell, if we do nothing, they\u2019ll build market-rate condos\u201d \u2014 \u201cluxury units\u201d that \u201cnobody can afford\u201d and would \u201cprice out\u201d longtime residents. A true boogeyman.\nUsually a deal is reached for a mix of market-rate and affordable rentals, and people move on with their lives.\nBut sometimes, negotiations fail and a developer does, in fact, build market-rate condos. Such was the case last decade when then-Council member Brad Lander and\nFortis Property Group\ncouldn\u2019t come to terms on a\nCobble Hill project\n.\nNow it is happening again at a Crown Heights site where a Bruce Eichner rental project was rejected for fear of gentrification and shadows. The offering plan for Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s condominium at 960 Franklin Avenue, as\nTRD\n\u2019s\nSheridan Wall\nreported\n, prices units at more than $1,200 per square foot. The cheapest is $600,000.\nThe development\u2019s 300 apartments will all be one or two bedrooms. That\u2019s another thing politicians don\u2019t like: projects that don\u2019t have units for \u201cfamilies\u201d (even though three-bedrooms are often rented to roommates).\nBut guess what? A boogeyman is defined as \u201c\na monstrous imaginary figure\n\u201d invoked to scare children. Adults in Crown Heights should not be afraid of Schwartz\u2019s modest-sized, market-rate condos.\nThe building is filling a former factory site and won\u2019t displace anyone, directly or indirectly. Instead of attracting several single people splitting the rent, condos will attract young couples, small families and empty-nesters who will put down roots.\nThe city, state and Metropolitan Transportation Authority will collect transfer taxes each time a unit sells \u2014 about $2.4 million for the first round of sales, plus about $9 million in commissions to real estate agents.\nThe 300 households will pay more than $6 million annually in city and state income taxes. Some will become patrons of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park, which are all within walking distance. Doormen will enhance street safety.\nIf market-rate condos are the worst thing that happens in Crown Heights, all neighborhoods should be so lucky.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIn 2012, a Colorado-based REIT called UDR and MetLife\npaid $635 million\nfor 801 Amsterdam Avenue and 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue, but now are looking to sell the portfolio for\n$450 million to $500 million\n. The five buildings are free-market rentals. Other than interest rates being 400 basis points higher today, what accounts for their decline in value? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Rejected names proposed for the new hybrid-electric Governors Island ferry include the Gov Boat, Boaty McBoatface, Watts Up Doc and Ferry Impressive, the New York Times reported.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The state lost out on $485 million in federal money when it did not transfer Medicare-eligible seniors off Medicaid between 2016 and 2021, according to the state comptroller,\nCity &amp; State\nreported. While the missed funding pales in comparison to what the state spends on Medicaid (a projected $109.6 billion this fiscal year), the news comes as New York faces broader federal funding cuts.\n\u2014 Animal-rights activists rallied outside Thursday\u2019s City Council meeting following the death of a Central Park carriage horse named Lady,\namNY\nreported. The group was supporting a new bill called Ryder\u2019s Law, which would eliminate New York\u2019s carriage horse industry.\n\u2014 The Council will likely override the mayor\u2019s veto of two bills that would raise the minimum pay of grocery delivery workers, according to remarks made ahead of the Council\u2019s Thursday meeting. The override vote will likely be held next month.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 4,510-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis of the Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$41 million\nfor roughly 72,000 square feet of retail space at 1600 Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. Triangle Equities sold the commercial condo to developer Parviz Farahzad.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21 million\nfor a 3,576-square-foot condominium unit at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown. Asher Alcobi of Peter Asche has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 20,470-square-foot, 18-unit residential property at 404 West 50th Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Bojidar Kadiev filed the permit on behalf of Benjamin Braka of Aetna Real Estate Management.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Suffolk lawmakers are moving to yank public funds from landlords whose Department of Social Services-backed rentals flout building or zoning codes.\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Legis. Nick Caracappa and James Mazzarella, would expand existing rules that already allow the county to withhold assistance if a property is \u201cdangerous, hazardous or detrimental to life or health.\u201d The added language would also cover any rental that fails to comply with municipal zoning or building standards, Newsday\nreported\n.\nBackers frame it as a quality-of-life fix in hot spots like Mastic Beach and Coram, pointing to egregious cases, such as makeshift kitchens with Charbroil grills, chopped-up interiors and wastewater systems buckling under excess tenants. The legislation would require municipalities to inspect homes before DSS placements, forcing landlords to bring properties up to code before collecting rent checks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting people\u2019s lives in jeopardy and we\u2019re aware of it,\u201d Caracappa said, adding the aim is to dismantle a \u201cbusiness model\u201d that lets owners reap county rent while barring inspectors from entry.\nOpponents warn the measure could backfire, shrinking an already scarce pool of units for DSS clients and overloading local code enforcement. Greta Guarton of the Long Island Coalition for the Homeless argued zoning rules don\u2019t necessarily impact health or safety, and the county should focus on adding affordable housing rather than cutting existing stock.\n\nWelfare to Work Commission chair Richard Koubek added that requiring inspections for every placement could \u201cderail\u201d the department\u2019s ability to house clients.\nCaracappa insists the county would start with \u201cmost egregious\u201d properties to avoid mass displacement. The bill had its second public hearing last week and is slated for committee review later this month.\nBetween January and May 2024, Suffolk placed nearly 500 homeless families and more than 600 single adults in emergency housing. There is $85 million budgeted for a \u201cSafety Net\u201d program, but it\u2019s unclear how much the county actually spends on DSS placements.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Moshe Wechsler has been granted a reprieve from debt payments on a massive Chicago multifamily loan.\nFannie Mae has struck a forbearance agreement with Wechsler\u2019s New York-based firm Emerald Empire on at least $125 million worth of loans attached to Chicago apartment properties. The rental buildings were sold by Chicago-based Pangea Properties in a huge real estate trade nearly three years ago. The deal made Emerald one of the city\u2019s largest landlords overnight and constituted one of the priciest multifamily transactions in Chicago history, if not the city\u2019s outright biggest deal in the sector.\nThe transaction involved about 7,500 housing units spread across more than 400 buildings, with a total price tag of about $600 million.\nNow, however, at least some of the debt has required the borrower to ask for a pause on payments.\n\u201cThe loans in question are currently in forbearance and are performing in accordance with the agreement,\u201d a Fannie Mae spokesperson said.\nThe properties in forbearance are encumbered by a tranche of debt within a bigger $430 million financing package, according to public records. Emerald borrowed the money from a group led by Arbor Realty Trust affiliates, according to Cook County documents. Lender NewPoint Real Estate Capital also participated in the financing before the debt was sold off to Fannie, the government-sponsored agency.\n\nAt the time the deal closed, Arbor described it as one of the largest Fannie Mae Structured Adjustable-Rate Mortgage loans of 2022; because its interest rate is adjustable, the costs of debt service have likely risen from when the deal was originated, since the Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate over the course of 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the $125 million tranche is the only portion of the package that has entered forbearance for now, or whether additional sections of the mortgage debt are also going without payment from the borrower.\nWechsler and Emerald Empire didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nThe forbearance agreement is a sign that Emerald Empire is working to get its operations in order to catch up on the loan. But it\u2019s unknown why the firm sought to enter forbearance. The mortgages aren\u2019t scheduled to mature until Jan. 1, 2033, public records show.\nCity officials have taken issue with the conditions of multiple properties within the portfolio, though. There\u2019s a handful of properties Emerald owns that are currently making their way through the city\u2019s housing court for building code violations. The landlord has been ordered to pay fines to the city at multiple properties for issues such as maintenance of rat abatement measures. Emerald has incurred multiple fines of $500 or more from city code violations at numerous properties, public records show.\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the allegedly poor property conditions are a factor in the forbearance agreement.",

The asking price amounts to $1,073 per square foot.\nThe six-bedroom main house has six-and-a-half bathrooms, a great room with custom woodwork, lower-level recreation room and a first-floor office. A two-bedroom coach house has a full bathroom and kitchen.\nThe estate is geared toward equestrian enthusiasts with a lighted, fenced-in riding area and stables.

The property also features a tennis court, hot tub and walking paths.\n\nIt can be subdivided, according to Burr Ridge village guidelines.\nOwner Jacqueline Laase Portillo and her former husband Beau Parrillo bought the mansion in 2002 for $1.65 million on roughly 4 acres and added an adjoining three acres in 2007 for $1.8 million.\nThe highest sale in Burr Ridge was recorded in 2022. Carmela Wallace, mother of the late rapper Juice WRLD, paid $6.9 million for a six-bedroom, 17,000-square-foot home at 6679 Lee Court.\nWallace\nalso purchased two acres next door to the mansion for $1.4 million at the same time, for a combined $8.3 million.

The real estate investment trust couldn\u2019t secure refinancing before a two-month forbearance period expired. Appraisals are in process, and Ashford requested additional time to prepare an exit strategy, according to special servicer Trimont Real Estate Advisors.\nThe portfolio, comprising 18 hotels in 13 states, has a balance of $590 million. A plurality of the properties are in Texas: the Hilton Garden Inn at 500 N I-35, Austin; the Marriott DFW Airport North at 8440 Freeport Parkway, Irving; the Sugar Land Marriott at 16090 City Walk, Sugar Land; and the Marriott Plaza at 555 South Alamo Street, San Antonio.\nNeither Ashford nor Trimont responded for comment.\nOccupancy in the hotels over a twelve-month period was down to 56 percent as of March 31. At the end of 2024, the portfolio\u2019s occupancy rate was 68 percent, following a peak of 70 percent in 2023. The portfolio\u2019s most difficult year was 2020, when occupancy reached a low of 33 percent.\nThat\u2019s when trouble for the loan began. Ashford\u2019s recent performance history is generally current through August 2024, but the loan\u2019s original maturity date was in April 2020, the same month Ashford requested immediate transfer to special servicing for the first time. It was returned to the master servicer \u2014 Wells Fargo \u2014 in April 2021.\nLast February, Ashford extended its maturity date for the fifth and final time. It\u2019s been on the watchlist for its final maturity date since October 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Bennett\u2019s assets have faced distress. A\ndifferent loan\nwent to special servicing first in April 2020 and again in 2024.\nTwo of the company\u2019s hotels landed in foreclosure last year\n. Additionally, Ashford was selling properties to pay debts throughout\n2023\nand\n2024\n.\nMorningstar newsflash\n: Hotel Portfolio Transfers to Special | June 16 2025\nAshford Highland Portfolio ($590.3MM | AHT1 2018-ASHF) has transferred to special servicing two months after its April 2025 maturity. The loan had been granted a two-month forbearance to finalize refinancing, but it appears the deadline was not met. The portfolio, backed by 18 hotel properties across the U.S., reported a\u00a0 2024 NCF that was 22% lower than the issuance level due to lower-than-anticipated revenue.\nServicer commentary: July 1 2025\nBorrower was unable to close on a refinance before the expiration of a 60 days forbearance period and the loan was transferred to Special Servicing due to Balloon Payment/Maturity Default.The borrower has requested additional time to work on an exit \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 strategy and the SS is reviewing. Appraisals are in process.\nMar 2025: Loan was on the watchlist for upcoming 4/9/2025 final maturity date.

        "content": "A top-performing office building in one of Austin\u2019s most competitive submarkets recently hit the market.\nEY Ventures listed the Arboretum Atrium, a 91,000-square-foot building at 9737 Great Hills Trail in Northwest Austin, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe three-story building is 98 percent leased, with one 2,200-square-foot space available on the first floor. Occupancy has consistently stayed above 92 percent since 2018, significantly outperforming the rest of the submarket, which had a 16.7 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which has the listing.\nMost of the building\u2019s leases extend into 2028 and beyond, providing long-term income stability. The building\u2019s competitive rent pricing \u2014 about $27 per square foot compared to $32 in the surrounding micro-market \u2014 has helped drive consistent leasing success.\n\u201cThere\u2019s substantial room for a new owner to push rents while maintaining tenant demand,\u201d Cushman\u2019s Matt Murphy said.\nThe property\u2019s walkability is another draw, with nearby access to restaurants and retailers such as Starbucks, Trader Joe\u2019s and Fire Bowl Cafe.\n\nThe asking price is undisclosed. Its taxable value is $17 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nTenants include tech companies Keyence and SourceDay and gaming company Panic Button.\nBuilt in 1984, the building is also bucking the trend for older office buildings, which generally have performed poorly since the pandemic. Office tenants prefer new, amenity filled office buildings in vibrant areas. But location is a big part of the sales pitch.\nThe area has become \u201cthe unofficial technology hub with the\nDomain\nand Arboretum as the two most walkable mixed-use destinations north of the river,\u201d Franklin Street\u2019s Ryan Bohls told the outlet.\nThe world\u2019s most-profitable company,\nNvidia\n, is poised to significantly expand its Austin presence with a lease at the One Uptown office tower near the Domain, adding to the influx of tech offices. Meanwhile, leasing is sluggish in\nDowntown Austin\n.\n",

City officials are calling it the first employer housing development of its kind in the county, another marker of the region\u2019s rapid change in recent years.\nThe building is planned for the 2.5-acre site at 2410, 2460 and 2058 North Australian Avenue, which a Breakers affiliate bought for $2.3 million in December, according to property records. Plans include a pool, sports field and shuttle services, the Post reported. The design team includes West Palm Beach-based Spina O\u2019Rourke &amp; Partners and Tyler Woolsey of Urban Design Studio.\nThe\nWest Palm Beach\nPlanning Board unanimously approved the project at its July meeting, but the project still requires final approval from the West Palm Beach City Commission.\n\n\u201cI love that they\u2019re creating a place for their employees to live, especially given the unaffordability of workers\u2019 housing in West Palm Beach,\u201d board member Will Corrente said at the July meeting.\nEmployment with\nthe Breakers\nwill be a requirement to live in the complex, which will primarily serve the hotel\u2019s temporary workforce.\nThe hotel was founded in 1896 by Henry Flagler and is owned by the\nheirs\nof his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, through the entity Flagler Systems. With more than 2,400 employees, it is one of the largest employers in Palm Beach County. The hotel relies on hundreds of foreign workers, and was last year approved to hire 249 workers with H2-B visas, the Post reported.\nThe Breakers has been adjusting to Palm Beach\u2019s growth in recent years. In December, the hotel bought the former Palm Beach Post Office from billionaire Jeff Greene for\n$28 million\n.\n\u2014\nKate Hinsche",

The price is over $8 million per acre. The seller was the U.S. General Services Administration, the federal government\u2019s real estate arm.\nPresidio Bay\u2019s plans for the site are yet to be determined, beyond it being mixed-use. The firm is working with city officials and will hold community meetings to figure out the best way to redevelop it. The campus could accommodate 600 to 1,000 units of housing and 600,000 to 800,000 square feet of commercial space, the outlet said.\nThe city of Menlo Park is on the hook to permit nearly 3,000 new units of housing before 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n.\nThe sale was part of the Trump Administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency\ncuts\n, as agencies shrunk their headcount and reduced the need for office space across the country. In selling the Rockaway Grove property, the federal government is expected to save taxpayers $107 million in deferred maintenance and about $4 million in annual maintenance costs, the GSA told the outlet.\n\n\u201cThis sale demonstrates our commitment to reducing the federal footprint while better serving our customer\u2019s needs,\u201d Mike Rigas, acting administrator for the GSA, said in a\nstatement\n.\nPresidio Bay is the developer behind the Springline mixed-use development in Menlo Park, one of the first major post-pandemic developments in the Bay Area. That property includes 183 apartments, 200,000 square feet of office space and various restaurant tenants.\nPresidio Bay will begin hosting monthly community meetings at Springline starting this month as the developer prepares to submit a formal project application to redevelop the Rockaway Grove site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Development is risky and complicated. It involves lots of decisions, and bad ones can be catastrophic.\nFor megaprojects, everything is multiplied. They are enormously challenging even for the smartest and most experienced developers.\nThe worst way to execute a megaproject would be to hand decision-making authority to more than two dozen people, each representing different constituencies with divergent and sometimes conflicting goals \u2014 and little or no real estate experience.\nTo make it even harder, you would have politicians lead this\n28-member group\nand require a two-thirds majority vote to approve a master plan.\nYou would include three levels of government, a community board, local residents, environmental justice advocates, planning organizations, labor unions, industry groups and public housing tenants.\nYou would install a\nsocialist\nas a vice chair. For good measure, you would tack on six advisory groups, each with its own agenda.\nAs a final complication, you\u2019d transfer the property to a local development corporation of city, state and federal officials, plus local residents, that must approve every RFP and contract \u2014 and have enforcement authority.\nWelcome, friends, to the Brooklyn Marine Terminal.\nThe $3.5 billion, 122-acre project would build 6,000 homes (40 percent of them affordable), modernize an aging, money-losing port, and completely reimagine a huge chunk of long-neglected waterfront.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why votes on the project have been\nrepeatedly\ncanceled\nfor lack of consensus, see above.\nYet the process has its defenders.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good model,\u201d said Sen. Andrew Gounardes, \u201cbut it can get a little messy.\u201d\nGournardes, the non-socialist vice chair of the 28-member task force, no doubt feels like he\u2019s herding cats as he tries to get at least 19 of them to agree on something.\n\u201cThere are voices that want nothing to happen here,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey say they want to protect the port, but they don\u2019t want to see any construction, investment, trucks, noise, anything. They are using the cover of the port to prevent anything from happening here.\u201d\nOthers do want something to happen, but disagree on what.\n\n\u201cThere are voices in the community who want to keep the entire site industrial,\u201d Gounardes said. \u201cThere are voices on the same block who hate the port and want open space across the waterfront. There are some people who say, \u2018Put housing there.\u2019 There is not one unified vision of what this site could be or should be.\u201d\nLike he said, it can get a little messy.\n\u201cThere is not one unified vision of what this site could be or should be.\u201d\nSen. Andrew Gounardes\nThe massive undertaking,\nannounced in May 2024\n, is going through a state process called a General Project Plan. But the Hochul administration is deferring to the city, making the Economic Development Corporation, led by Andrew Kimball, the lead agency.\nIn fairness to EDC, it is trying to avoid the outcomes of other models for megaprojects involving public land. Atlantic Yards, which is now Pacific Park, is half-built, in\nforeclosure\nand on its\nthird developer\n\u2014 22 years after it was announced.\nBut at least something has been built there. The same cannot be said for\nSunnyside Yard\n, where the de Blasio administration put together a steering committee like the one at Brooklyn Marine Terminal. It was dysfunctional from the outset, with members demanding a financially impossible amount of affordable housing.\nThey even\npushed their own hero\n, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, off the committee when she tried to reason with them. Eleven years of planning has come to nothing.\nThe Brooklyn Marine Terminal task force, in contrast, has lots of members who want to get to yes, Gounardes said. It looks like they are close to a compromise on a master plan that is one-third port, one-third housing and one-third open space. Port renovations will cost about\n$1.7 billion\n.\nThere is still a lot of posturing. For example, Council member Shahana Hanif is demanding the project include \u201creal displacement protections for rent-regulated tenants and small businesses,\u201d even though it is not removing a single home or store, and rent-regulated tenants are already the most protected renters in the nation.\nHanif, socialist vice chair Alexa Avil\u00e9s and other progressives have whittled the number of market-rate homes down to the bare minimum needed to yield $1.3 billion for the port, which will also get $360 million from a federal grant \u2014 unless the Trump administration cancels it while the task force bickers.\nIf this were not public land, politics were not an issue and no constituencies needed to be pacified, a developer could build more than 10,000 market-rate homes with spectacular views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and the Lower Manhattan skyline.\nThat would generate enough profit to subsidize thousands of affordable units, ample green space and esplanades, a ferry stop and shuttle buses to the nearest subway stations.\nBut in the real world, that is just as far-fetched as the Sunnyside Yard fantasies.\nThe Brooklyn Marine Terminal project will get done under this incredibly convoluted model \u2014 or it won\u2019t get done at all.\n",

        "content": "Emerald Group and Infinite Care bought a pair of senior rehabilitation centers in South Florida for a combined $29 million.\nIn the bigger deal, an entity led by Lakewood, New Jersey-based investor Yisroel Herzka and tied to Emerald and New York-based Infinite Care paid $18.9 million for the 120-bed Tamarac Rehabilitation and Health Center at 7901 Northwest 88th Avenue in Tamarac, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The property consists of a 38,200-square-foot, one-story building completed in 1979 on a 3.8-acre site.\nAnother entity also led by Herzka and tied to Emerald and Infinite Care bought the 100-bed Pinecrest Rehabilitation Center at 13650 Northeast Third Court in North Miami, according to records and Vizzda. The 30,400-square-foot, one-story building was completed in 1967 on a 2.4-acre site.\nFort Lauderdale-based NuVision Management, a consultancy for geriatric and pediatric long-term care and rehabilitative service providers, sold both properties, according to Vizzda records. The buyers obtained a $46.6 million Valley Bank loan, which is cross-collateralized across the North Miami and Tamarac properties, as well as other Emerald and Infinite Care properties.\n\nTamarac Rehabilitation provides skilled nursing and rehabilitation services to patients who have had strokes or broken bones, its website sites. Pinecrest Rehabilitation offers post-hospital care, skilled nursing and rehabilitation services for various conditions, including pneumonia, heart conditions, bone fractures, joint replacement, strokes, Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer-related diagnoses, according to its website.\nSouth Florida\u2019s senior care facilities have continued to trade sporadically, as they are slightly more resilient to macroeconomic conditions such as elevated interest rates and inflation. That\u2019s partly because the state is a magnet for retirees, ensuring continued demand for\nassisted living\n, memory care, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers.\nIn April, Welltower real estate investment trust bought the 220-bed assisted and independent living facility Oakmonte Village of Davie at 8201 Stirling Road in Davie for\n$34.3 million\n. In June, Garden Healthcare, led by Barry Braunstein and Samuel Feuer, paid\n$24 million\nfor the 66-acre Eastridge at Cutler Bay at 19301 Southwest 87th Avenue in Cutler Bay. The property offers independent and assisted living, skilled nursing, memory care and rehabilitation services.\nLeo Friedman, a senior living tycoon, bought the 472-unit Abbey Delray senior living facility at 2000 Lowson Boulevard in Delray Beach for\n$30 million\nin April.\n",

        "content": "Dick Lucas wants to \u201clegalize building\u201d in California.\nIs that just a Dick thing to say, as he would have you believe in his campaign for the California State Assembly?\nOr is Lucas confused? Conventional wisdom might indicate as much about a tech exec making real estate development policy the centerpiece of his campaign before he even settles on a party let alone a base of support to court in a territory that sprawls from a patch of the Westside through parts of Beverly Hills to Santa Monica.\nAnd don\u2019t expect any help figuring out Lucas through a lens of identity politics \u2014 he is openly struggling with his political identity.\nAt 6\u20194\u201d, with a beard and hair falling inches below his shoulders, he readily concedes he looks \u201ckinda \u2026\u00a0 like a hippie\u201d but cuts across that grain, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m young, but I wear a suit\u201d he says. \u201cI love America. I\u2019m trying a little bit to break people\u2019s brains.\u201d\nIndeed, the 32-year-old Glendale native hopes his lack of allegiance to any one party will sway enough voters to unseat two-term incumbent Democrat\nRick Chavez Zbur\n,\nwho crushed the Republican candidate in the last election.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to unfreeze a culture stuck in this Republican-Democrat thing for a long time,\u201d says the Boston College graduate, recent husband and first-time father-to-be.\nThat\u2019s where \u201clegalize building,\u201d comes into play.\nSure it\u2019s hyperbole, but could the audacious statement bring the right mix of cheek and world-weariness to unfreeze, unstick and unlock a seat in the California legislature?\nLucas stacks up a case behind his bold words:\n\u201cI think that the Dems in California, they\u2019re less open to change some of the ridiculous permitting process and all that,\u201d Lucas says over a medium spice half chicken plate at Cha Cha Chicken in Santa Monica on a recent afternoon. \u201cI think the Republicans are more like \u2014 cut the red tape. But the Democrats are more open to denser housing, whereas what I\u2019ve seen so far is the Republicans in California are not as open to it. I think they\u2019re much more pro single-family zoning.\u201d\nLucas leans toward density, but doesn\u2019t quibble with single-family housing \u2014 just make it fast, either way.\n\u201cThe fact that it takes more than two minutes to get approved for a permit is insane,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s have instant permits. This is a city level thing, but if you look at the number of permits issued during Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 tenure, it has cratered. I am pro-housing, pro-density. I\u2019m full-on YIMBY.\u201d\nIf that appeals to real estate professionals, consider Lucas\u2019 views of the Measure ULA property transfer tax on deals over $5.3 million \u2014 \u201cridiculous.\u201d Rent control? He\u2019s \u201ccompletely against\u201d it.\n\u201cBecause you look at where the money\u2019s going \u2014 the money is going to affordable housing projects, which is basically just lighting taxpayer dollars on fire,\u201d he says. \u201cVery few units actually get built. And I think the real solution here is legalize building. Let developers come in. Let the market figure it out.\u201d\n\nDevelopers, in particular, might warm even more to Lucas\u2019 view on the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\n, even after recent amendments that removed some longstanding barriers of multifamily projects.\n\u201cWe need a clean environment, but the problem is CEQA is weaponized,\u201d he says. It has become used as a way to just prevent projects from being built.\u201d\nHow to get from bold statements to the nomination of a political party to a seat in Sacramento?\nThat will take the same start-up mentality that Lucas used to grow his Santa Monica-based Fullsend Solutions, a software agency building web, iOS and Android applications, into a profitable business.\nIn a heavily \u201cblue\u201d district of around 500,000 people Lucas says he\u2019s likely to gin up interest from the Republican Party.\n\u201cI think the easiest way for me to get past the primary is to just say, OK, I\u2019m Republican, because I think I would have a really good shot of getting the second-most votes. Top two vote getters get past the primary to the general; it doesn\u2019t matter your party.\u201d\nThat might prove to be an early test of Lucas\u2019 math chops more than political skills. The 51st District has around 150,000 registered Democrats and about 20,000 registered Republicans. Four Democratic candidates could split their vote almost evenly and all do better than a Republican who got 100 of his party\u2019s members.\nA base of 20,000 is a start, though, and Lucas says he has made contact with Roxanne Hoge, chairperson of the Republican Party in L.A. County.\nWill he be able to run under the GOP banner even as he openly claims RINO (Republican in Name Only) status?\nLucas is hoping social media will help. He used it to kick off his campaign last month, putting his 23,600 followers on Instagram and 3,325 followers on X in the mix.\nHe hasn\u2019t raised any money, counts on his wife, who leads professional development sessions for teachers, as his campaign manager.\nOh, he\u2019s also a novice, with nothing beyond an elector victory for the presidency of his eight-grade class on his political resume.\nHe\u2019s undaunted so far.\n\u201cWe have, what, 10 months till the primary in June 2026,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking like a startup mentality. Like with as few resources as possible, and some videos and some ideas and just talking to people like you, how far can I go?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A pair of South Loop multifamily towers totaling 502 units just hit the market.\nReal estate giant Brookfield is selling a 411-unit building at 1255 South Michigan Avenue known as Sky55 as well as an affordable senior living building at 1251 South Michigan Avenue.\nBrookfield added the buildings to its portfolio through its $11.4 billion acquisition of Forest City Realty Trust in 2018. The bigger building was last refinanced for $96 million in 2020, with Prudential Multifamily Mortgage serving as the lender. The senior living building also obtained a $5.7 million loan from Prudential at the same time.\nThe listings, which are being marketed by CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Pete Marino, are hitting the market at a busy time.\nChicago has some of the strongest rent growth in the county, and a lack of developments in the pipeline suggests\nthat trajectory won\u2019t be changing any time soon.\n\nAt Sky55, market-rate units range from about $2,700 for a one bedroom to $3,700 for a two bedroom, two bathroom unit. Within the property, 30 percent of the units are set aside as affordable with rents ranging from $1,000 to $1,200. The building is 94 percent occupied.\nThe senior living property is made up of entirely affordable units, also with rents ranging from $1,000 to $1,200. The development was funded in part by federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits.\u00a0 Both properties include ground floor retail.\nWhile the properties are being pitched as value-add opportunities, some investors are hesitant to jump into the Chicago market. High interest rates coupled with an unpredictable property tax system and political environment have been causing the suburbs to outpace the city in multifamily sales.\nStill, momentum is gaining in the city. The State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio\nrecently listed a Streeterville apartment building\n, joining the pack of downtown apartments to hit the market recently.\nThat 481-unit property, the Streeter at 345 East Ohio Street, last sold 2007 for $210 million.",

The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, plus $260 million in mezzanine financing.\nThe debt landed in special servicing in September after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated its 617,000-square-foot space for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant.\nDBRS Morningstar downgraded several CMBS classes last summer, citing the revenue hit and operating shortfalls that forced the special servicer to dip into reserves.\n\nA January loan modification freed more reserves to cover the gap, but that fix expired in July. SL Green and RXR are reportedly in talks for another workout to unlock the tens of millions needed to backfill space.\nThose plans may face a harsher reality if Nomura Holdings, the tower\u2019s largest tenant with 700,000 square feet, moves ahead with a rumored jump to Vornado\u2019s Penn 2. While Nomura\u2019s lease runs to 2033, it has a termination option in 2027, which it had to exercise by July 1; it\u2019s unclear if it did so.\nThe 49-story property \u2014 built in 1989 as part of a 2 million-square-foot complex with condos, theater space and a public plaza \u2014 is the last asset held by New York REIT, which had been sparring with SL Green and RXR in court over a $90 million reserve. A judge ruled in February the money\nbelongs to the REIT\n.\nWorldwide Plaza\u2019s collapse is part of a broader trend of Manhattan office towers with pre-pandemic debt facing steep write-downs. This week, Charles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue was\nappraised at $41 million\n, down from $300 million in 2015.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It was the longtime home of the late Robert Dow, an Olympic fencer and managing partner at Lord, Abbett &amp; Co., and his wife, asset manager Christina Seix Dow.\nTheir daughter, Lindsay Dow, is handling the sale through\nRichard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\n, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The asking price breaks down to $2,107 per square foot.\nThe French Provincial main house, built in 1928, spans roughly 14,000 square feet with 16 bedrooms, banquet dining, a gold-leaf-trimmed salon, wine cellar and a wood-paneled library. A converted chapel serves as a sitting room.\nExterior buildings include a six-bedroom 1930s guesthouse, a two-bedroom carriage house from the 1920s and a secluded log cabin overlooking rolling hills. The grounds also feature two pools, a tennis court, a boathouse on Tuxedo Lake, a koi pond pavilion and a 2,000-kilowatt solar array that, along with geothermal energy, powers the entire property.\n\nRobert Dow, who fished in Tuxedo Park as a boy, reportedly jumped at the chance to buy Renamor in the 1990s, though it\u2019s unclear how much he paid for the property. The family split time there until returning full-time in 2016, hosting charity dinners and community events during Covid.\nTuxedo Park, once a playground for New York\u2019s elite, retains its private country club and lore as the birthplace of the tuxedo jacket.\nDespite pandemic-era price spikes, Orange County real estate trails Hudson River east-bank markets.

        "content": "Russell Weiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, is alleging the project manager and general contractor of his $100 million-plus estate in Miami Beach completed defective work that lacked the proper approvals and permits.\nWeiner\u2019s Pine Tree Development filed a new lawsuit this summer against Andrea D\u2019Alessio and his Inspirata Management Company, Deere Construction/Deere Industries and Baco Engineering Contractor, focusing on alleged site-wide issues he discovered at 5011 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach.\nThe complaint adds to the\nbillionaire\u2019s saga\nover the waterfront assemblage, where he plans the \u201cmost incredible estate in Miami,\u201d Weiner previously told\nThe Real Deal.\nThat includes a new 30,000-square-foot main mansion at 5011 Pine Tree Drive.\nThe complaint alleges that structures on the properties were built without the required building permits or zoning approvals. (Some construction was being done via a private provider and a phased permit, which allows property owners to use private providers to review plans and perform inspections that the city would otherwise handle.)\nThe complaint further cites alleged issues that include the improper installation of more than 400 piles; that the entire site was inadequately filled, compacted and graded, leading to\nsinkholes, soil instability and erosion post-rainfall; incorrectly installed sewer lines that triggered a stop-work order, which required the entire project be reworked; and a generator pad that was installed without approval.\nThe complaint also alleges issues with the reconstruction of the boat house that was built in the 1920s; variances between what was built and what was approved at the Collins estate at 5011 Pine Tree, which was deemed architecturally significant by the city; missing drainage and other examples of improper construction, according to the lawsuit.\nInspirata and D\u2019Alessio filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on Monday, court filings show. The judge has not yet ruled.\n\u201cAndrea [D\u2019Alessio] is one of the most talented architects I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Glen Waldman, Inspirata and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to have the court determine not only did he do nothing wrong, but this is personal vendetta by Mr. Weiner for reasons we can\u2019t understand.\u201d\nWaldman, a partner at Armstrong Teasdale, said he expects his clients will be vindicated and will seek to collect legal fees and costs from Weiner.\nWeiner declined to comment on the litigation.\n\nWeiner\u2019s plans to relocate and preserve the Collins estate were documented in 2023 by the Miami Design Preservation League. The structure was moved to the western portion of the property. The Collins estate was designed by architect Russell Pancoast and built in the 1920s by Irving Collins, a son of Miami Beach founding father John Collins.\nA group of\nanonymous neighbors last year\nindicated issues with construction, pointing to the alleged forgery of a notarized notice of commencement filed with Miami-Dade County. Such notices typically mark the start of construction, and are secured in conjunction with a building permit in the property\u2019s respective municipality.\nWeiner\u2019s company first sued D\u2019Alessio and related parties last fall after\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the alleged red flags. An amended complaint submitted in December alleged D\u2019Alessio, Inspirata and another of D\u2019Alessio\u2019s companies crafted \u201cschemes to defraud and cheat\u201d the property owner through overbilling, false charges and self-dealing.\nD\u2019Alessio allegedly promoted himself as a \u201crenowned architectural designer\u201d and residential contractor, but he didn\u2019t have a Florida license for design, construction, or any certifications with respect to design or development, according to the December complaint.\nD\u2019Alessio denied the allegations, and previously said that Weiner knew D\u2019Alessio was not the general contractor. State records show D\u2019Alessio received his general contractor\u2019s license in May of this year.\nDeere\u2019s lawyer, Francisco Touron III, declined to comment, but wrote via email that the company is \u201cprepared to aggressively defend against Plaintiff\u2019s spurious claims.\u201d\nWeiner acquired the two lots from private school owners David and Leila Centner in 2021, hiring D\u2019Alessio\u2019s Inspirata as a project manager and owner\u2019s representative for construction of the waterfront estate. As part of the agreement, Weiner\u2019s company would pay Inspirata nearly $41,000 a month tied to the design, development and construction of the properties.\nThe latest complaint alleges breach of contract, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. In Inspirata and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s motion to dismiss, their attorneys claim that Pine Tree Development failed to satisfy Florida law\u2019s requirements for breach of contract, among other arguments. The motion to dismiss also argues that the agreement between Pine Tree and Inspirata \u201cexplicitly states that Inspirata is not responsible for construction.\u201d\nThe properties are separated by the slender home at 5101 Pine Tree Drive, which Weiner also owns \u2014 he acquired the middle piece\nvia foreclosure\nof\nRichard and Maria Meruelo\u2019s\nproperty.\nWeiner hasn\u2019t disclosed his plans for the assemblage, but demolition of the 5101 Pine Tree home is underway, he wrote via text. (Miami Beach allows property owners to aggregate up to three contiguous parcels if the third lot is used for expanded yards or accessory structures, like pools, cabanas and sports courts.) Records show a notice of commencement for the demolition was signed last week.\n",

        "content": "Louis Naidorf, the architect responsible for Los Angeles\u2019 iconic Capitol Records Building and a passel of other landmarks of the region\u2019s commercial real estate landscape has died at age 96.\nNaidorf\u2019s longtime friend Mike Harkins confirmed his death on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nNaidorf\u2019s love for architecture dates back to his childhood. He started sketching towns at eight years old, and collecting architecture books at age 12. At 13, he asked for a job with local architect Sanford Kent and got his start in the field. He went on to study architecture at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n.\nHis master\u2019s thesis in 1950 foreshadowed what would become the Capitol Records Building. Naidorf imagined that computers would become ubiquitous and compact, eliminating the need for large offices. He proposed creating circular office buildings to optimize space.\nRather than attend his commencement ceremony, Naidorf interviewed at architecture firm Welton Becket and Associates and was hired on the spot. Three years later, he was entrusted with his first major assignment, dubbed \u201cProject X.\u201d He was given little information other than the building\u2019s dimensions and location and had no idea that it would become the headquarters of Capitol Records.\nNaidorf applied the round shape to the building and aimed to design a \u201chappy building\u201d both for tenants and passersby. Naidorf repeatedly debunked the myth that the building was designed to resemble a stack of records, though he welcomed the comparisons, saying \u201cIf it makes people happy to think that, so be it.\u201d\n\nThe Capitol Records Building opened in 1956 and was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 2006.\nBesides the famous structure in Hollywood, Naidorf also designed the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the\nBeverly Center\n, the Beverly Hilton hotel, the now-demolished L.A. Memorial Sports Arena, and the Ronald Reagan State Building.\nOutside of L.A., Naidorf led the six-year restoration of the California State Capitol in Sacramento, and designed the Rancho Mirage home of former President Gerald Ford. He also designed Phoenix\u2019s Valley National Bank building, now the Chase Tower, the tallest structure in Arizona; and the Hyatt Regency Dallas and its adjacent Reunion Tower.\nNaidorf retired at 87 but kept his architecture license active, maintaining the oldest active license in the state by taking renewal exams every year. He\u2019s survived by his daughter, four stepchildren, 11 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plans for a privately-funded Chicago Fire FC stadium received a boost of South Loop resident support.\nThe South Loop Neighbors group conducted a survey of more than 650 residents and found that 73 percent were supportive, and almost 45 percent of supporters were \u201cstrongly supportive\u201d of the proposal. About 10 percent of respondents said they were opposed to the Major League Soccer team\u2019s proposal, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe team\u2019s owner, billionaire Joe Mansueto, plans to personally bankroll the $650 million soccer stadium for the Chicago Fire FC at The 78, Related Midwest\u2019s long-stalled megadevelopment in the South Loop. The Fire\u2019s Soldier Field lease expires this year, though the team plans to extend it to bridge the gap until the new stadium is ready.\nThe planned 22,000-seat open-air stadium, designed by architecture firm Gensler, would give the Fire its own home after years of sharing use of Soldier Field with the Chicago Bears. The stadium would also serve as an anchor for The 78, a 62-acre area along the Chicago River between Chinatown and Roosevelt Road.\n\nThe neighborhood support comes several weeks after Related Midwest submitted its zoning application for the stadium plan to the City Council. Even though the stadium itself will be privately funded, city officials will still need to figure out how tax-increment financing dollars could be used to pay for public infrastructure for better access and connectivity.\nThe\u00a0 South Loop Neighbors group said about 75 percent of the residents that participated in the survey were area homeowners. Some of the comments generated were supportive of the stadium design and vision for a riverwalk extension and other amenities, but concerns about traffic congestion and pedestrian connectivity were brought up. Plans for a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line station at 15th Street and Clark Street were tossed by\nRelated Midwest\nin June.\nIn a deal struck earlier this year,\nMansueto\n, the Morningstar Credit founder who bought the team in 2019, would buy 10 acres at The 78.\nTerms for the revised redevelopment agreement are still being negotiated by Related Midwest and city planning officials as the scope of the project takes shape. The original 2019 plan called for up to $551 million in infrastructure projects that Related would finance up front and be reimbursed for through property tax gains generated onsite.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The joint venture will add more than 1,000 apartments, 20,000 square feet of retail and a public park to the 22-acre East River site, which has been reshaping the Brooklyn waterfront since its 2005 rezoning.\nThree buildings \u2014 at 21 and 37 Freeman Street and 209 West Street \u2014 are set to break ground next summer, where the developers will deliver 300 affordable units alongside market-rate rentals.\nBank OZK is providing an $81 million senior land loan and InterVest Capital Partners is kicking in $33 million in mezzanine financing. JLL Capital Markets\u2019 Christopher Peck and Nicco Lupo arranged the debt.\nInterVest also structured an equity package covering acquisition and predevelopment costs.\nPark Tower has already delivered roughly 3,000 units across nine parcels at Greenpoint Landing, with another 2,500 in the pipeline.

More recently, it partnered with LMXD on Jasper, a 499-unit building in Hunters Point with 30,000 square feet of retail.\nLMXD\u2019s parent company and Park Tower previously partnered to develop 300 affordable units at Greenpoint Landing between 2014 and 2017.\nThe retail component of the latest phase of Greenpoint Landing is already taking shape; brokerage Igloo is slated to lease the 20,000-square-foot space, aiming to curate a tenant mix that fits the growing residential community. The site\u2019s momentum is further boosted by neighborhood amenities \u2014 from cafes to grocery stores \u2014 and a planned elementary school nearby.\nThe New York Liberty also recently announced an $80 million, 75,000-square-foot practice facility in Greenpoint, slated to open in 2027, underscoring the area\u2019s pull for high-profile investment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal had been in the works for about six months. Glaser\u2019s investor and partner, Jarrett and Sean Posner\u2019s firm, financed the purchase.\nGlaser could sell or rent the existing home as is, but he is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nThe listing agent, Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said Kahn told him he spent more than $30 million combined on two renovations of the now 19,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom and 13-bathroom mansion. The\nKahns\npaid $2.4 million for their\nNorth Bay Road\nproperty in 1991, records show. The home was built in 1936. It includes a pool, new seawall, dock and a tennis court.\n\u201cThe house is in very good condition,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s got all the bells and whistles.\u201d\n\nGlaser has said he could flip the property or build the new mansion. He hired Domo Architecture + Design to design a 35,000-square-foot mansion, which would include a movie theater; wellness center with a sauna, steam room and fitness center; pickleball and paddle courts; a lap pool; a main pool and a 27-car understory.\nThe lot is nearly 500 feet deep and has about 290 feet of waterfront.\nNorth Bay Road is home to celebrity buyers who include\nDavid and Victoria Beckham\n, the Bee Gees\u2019 Barry Gibb, Cindy Crawford, Michael Bay and Shakira.\nLand prices in Miami Beach have hit record highs this summer.\nNearby on North Bay Road, Witkoff sold the 0.4-acre waterfront property at 4766 North Bay Road for $24.3 million, or\n$1,370 per square foot\n. It was the highest price per square foot for land ever achieved in Miami Beach \u2014 until Colombian businessman Jorge Mattos and his wife, Patricia, sold their waterfront home at 68 La Gorce Circle on Miami Beach\u2019s La Gorce Island\nfor $32.7 million\n, or about $1,700 per square foot earlier this month.\nThe current asking price for Glaser\u2019s property \u2014 for purchase and rent \u2014 marks the priciest in Miami-Dade County.\nThe second most-expensive rental on the market is the waterfront mansion at 440 South Mashta Drive in Key Biscayne, asking more than $433,000 a month with Gustavo Gambino of Gambino Real Estate Corp. The second priciest home for sale is actually a three-house, 2.1-acre compound at 190 Palm Avenue, on the market for $148.5 million with Fredrik Eklund of the Eklund-Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman.\n",

He tapped Carolwood Estates\u2019\nMarci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi\n, along with\nPlus Real Estate\n\u2019s Tyrone McKillen, to market the property.\nLorenzo, a former nightclub promoter turned high-end designer, has lived in the Spanish Revival home since 2018. He and his wife Desiree Manuel paid $8.5 million for it and then enlisted designers Kathleen and Tommy Clements for the residence\u2019s redesign.\nThe 1930-built, Spanish-style property is five beds and seven baths across nearly 7,200 square feet. It consists of a main house, guest house, pool and sports court.\nThe gated residence marks one of Los Feliz\u2019s pricier listings, capping off the top five. Although, it\u2019s still far from Los Feliz\u2019s most expensive on-market property at 4320 Cedarhurst Circle, which is asking just shy of $18 million. That six-bed, seven-bath home was restored by fashion designer Sue Wong.\n\nWith Fear of God\u2019s continued ascent, Lorenzo and family\u2019s real estate also expanded at the end of 2023. That\u2019s when the designer and his wife purchased 9051 Briarcrest Lane in Beverly Hills Post Office for $19.5 million.\n\u201cIn Beverly Hills, it feels like you\u2019re away from the chaos of the city but somehow still in it. It\u2019s nice to look out your window and not be staring into your neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Manuel told\nArchitectural Digest\nthis month.\nLorenzo began his career in fashion designing custom pieces for Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cPurpose\u201d tour in 2011, moving on to launch Fear of God in 2013. The business includes the luxury streetwear label, where knit T-shirts easily go for over $1,000 and trousers are around $1,200. There\u2019s also a more accessible Fear of God Essentials line. The newest addition to the business is the Fear of God Athletics label, which is being created in partnership with Adidas.\nThe company\u2019s former CEO told\nVogue Business\nin 2023 the business had room to eventually grow to $1 billion in sales. Revenue at that time was reportedly in the range of $200 million to $300 million.\n",

        "content": "Bill Ackman sold one of his two Upper West Side apartments for a steep discount.\nThe billionaire hedge funder traded a co-op at 211 Central Park West, known as the Beresford, for $9.4 million, according to public records. The deal, down from the\n$13.5 million\nhe paid for it in 2017, works out to roughly $3,200 a square foot.\nThe Pershing Square Capital Management founder bought Unit 8F about a month before he closed on another unit on the same floor for $8.6 million. Ackman\nsought to offload\nboth apartments, listed in November with the option to purchase separately or together, for a combined $20 million.\nUnit 8F, which nabbed a signed contract in April, spans more than 2,900 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features a gas fireplace, an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park.\nUnit 8E is still on the market with an asking price of $8.3 million.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern and Sloane Square\u2019s Vivian Fisher, who represented Ackman in the deal, declined to comment. Both brokers are sharing the listing for the remaining apartment.\nBefore buying the two eighth-floor units, Ackman lived at the pre-war co-op with his ex-wife, Karen Ann Herskovitz. The couple paid $26 million for a duplex in 2006, which at the time was the property\u2019s priciest deal.\nThe 20-story building between West 81st and West 82nd streets is known for housing a\nnumber of notable buyers\n, including actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld, actress Glenn Close, singer Diana Ross and the former CEO of Coach, Lewis Frankfort. Amenities in the building include full-time doormen and a fitness center.\nAmong Ackman\u2019s other Manhattan trades are a Norman Foster-designed penthouse on West 77th Street, which he bought for $22.5 million and later\nwent to bat\nover plans for the property with the Landmark Preservation Commission. He also paid\n$91.5 million\nfor a penthouse at Extell Development\u2019s One57 in 2015.\n",

The investment followed Berkshire\u2019s purchase of 1.8 million Lennar shares for $222 million in the first quarter.\nThe investment gave Lennar stock a major boost, with its stock trading at over $135 per share on Friday morning, or more than 4 percent higher than Thursday\u2019s closing price. By 3:30 p.m. on Friday, Lennar\u2019s share price dropped to $132.40, or up 1.95 percent from Thursday\u2019s closing.\nBerkshire Hathaway also made a smaller investment in Arlington, Texas-based\nhomebuilder\nD.R. Horton\n, buying 1.5 million shares for about $203 million in the first quarter. It sold 27,000 D.R.

        "content": "Lore Development Group plans a 402-unit apartment project on a portion of the closed Johnson &amp; Wales University campus in North Miami,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nLore, a joint venture between Leste Group and Brazilian firm Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio, wants to develop the Biscayne North Miami building on a 3.2-acre site on three lots east and west of Northeast 17th Avenue, between Northeast 126th and 127th streets, according to Jorge Rucas of Leste. Designed by Corwil Architects, the building will consist of studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments. All will be market-rate rentals.\nThe preliminary plan is for an eight-story building, Rucas said.\nConstruction is expected to start by the third quarter of next year, and completion is expected in 2028, he added.\nThe development site consists of parking lot parcels at 1660 Northeast 127th Street and 12600 Northeast 17th Avenue, as well as a vacant lot.\nBrickell-based Lore paid $26 million for the property in June, securing a $13 million acquisition loan from Brickell-based Linkvest Capital, records show.\nChris Lentz of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Lore in the financing.\nThe seller, Chicago-based Golub &amp; Co., paid\n$10 million\nfor the site in 2021, according to records. Golub had planned a 450-unit multifamily building, and Leste and Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio were investors with Golub in the site and project.\nThe Lore JV, which was formed in 2023, now is the site\u2019s owner and project developer after the recent purchase, Rucas said.\n\u201cWe had a different LP [limited partners] and co-GP [general partners] structure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was another development and partners involved. [Now] instead of being just investors, we are now the developer.\u201d\n\nLeste, led by CEO Emmanuel Hermann and managing partner Stephan de Sabrit, is a global alternative investment manager focused on real estate, private equity and other business lines such as Brazilian agribusiness, according to its website. It lists offices in Miami\u2019s Brickell, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro-based Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio, founded in 1994, is an independent asset manager, its website shows. Marcelo Naidich is the portfolio manager.\nLore\u2019s pipeline of South Florida projects includes the 48-unit Lincoln Coconut Grove condo building at the intersection of Southwest 27th and Lincoln avenues and Darwin Street in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove.\nIt also plans the 505-unit Summit at Brickell multifamily tower on the half-acre site on the southeast corner of Southwest 10th Street and Southwest First Avenue in Miami\u2019s financial district. The firm paid\n$35 million\nfor the development site in 2023.\nLore is in the \u201clast mile\u201d of reviews and permitting needed before it starts construction of Summit at Brickell, Rucas said.\nJohnson &amp; Wales University, which trained South Florida\u2019s hospitality workforce, closed its North Miami outpost in 2021. Miami-based Property Markets Group beat more than a dozen firms to scoop up the 25-acre campus, putting it under contract for\n$60 millio\nn in 2021. It then flipped portions of the campus to other developers.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group paid\n$13.6 million\nfor a 3-acre site at JWU in 2022, where it\u2019s developing the eight-story, 382-unit Manor Biscayne apartment building.\nAlso in 2022, North Miami-based Tate Capital bought the university\u2019s former recreation center at 1600 Northeast 126th Street for\n$10.7 million\n, leasing it to the city of North Miami under a 15-year term.\nMater Academy Charter Schools paid\n$16.8 million\nfor several JWU sites in 2022, opening a K-12 charter school in at least one of the buildings it purchased.\n",

Swift Real Estate Partners sold the property to GD Realty for $31.5 million, Omid Broukhim, who represented the buyer, said. The buyer and a source familiar with the off-market deal confirmed the price.\nThe property at 790 East Colorado Boulevard, called The Terrace, was part of a three-building office complex in Pasadena that Swift Real Estate partners\npurchased\nfrom PGIM Real Estate for $193 million six years ago. The offices at 790 East Colorado Boulevard were purchased for $59 million, property records reveal.\nThe 146,000-square-foot office building is 70 percent leased, according to a release announcing the sale by JLL, which represented the seller. JLL declined to comment. Swift Real Estate Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment. GD Realty chief executive and founder Arash Danialifar said it was \u201cone of the most unique office buildings I have encountered.\u201d\nThe three properties were collectively known as \u201cThe Pasadena Collection,\u201d and spanned 517,000 square feet. The portfolio was 68 percent occupied then. The two other properties were a 212,000 square-foot building at 155 North Lake Avenue, and a 159,000 square-foot building at 35 North Lake Avenue.\n\nRecently, another office complex in Pasadena\nsold\nat a discount. Harbor Associates and Roxborough Group purchased the Pasadena Towers for $120 million. The seller, CBRE Investment Management, purchased the two office properties, at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard that total 477,000 square feet, for $256 million in 2016.\nThat isn\u2019t the only distress happening in the city. The Pasadena Office Tower at 150 South Los Robles Avenue saw its value\ndecline\n59 percent in a decade and is worth millions less than the loan connected to the property.\nThe San Gabriel Valley, where Pasadena is located, has an 8.2 percent office vacancy rate compared to that of all Greater Los Angeles, which has a 24.1 percent vacancy rate.\n",

        "content": "Paramount Group is facing scrutiny over whether the company is putting the interests of its CEO Albert Behler ahead of shareholders.\nParamount, a publicly traded REIT and a major landlord in New York City and San Francisco, revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this year it paid millions of dollars to Behler\u2019s outside businesses, including to a private jet company in which Behler had a 50 percent stake.\nLast month, the firm disclosed it is under an SEC investigation over disclosures related to conflicts of interest, perks, related-party deals, and executive compensation.\nNow,\nThe Real Deal\ndiscovered Behler pushed for a no-bid securities contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building in which Paramount holds only a 5 percent stake, to Guardian Services, according to sources and communications reviewed by\nTRD\n.\nContracts of this size are not usually required to go through a bidding process or board review.\nIt is unusual, however, for a chief executive of a billion-dollar REIT to get directly involved in such small-scale deals. Guardian\u2019s contract went into effect in August, amid the ongoing SEC probe into conflicts of interest and news of the company\u2019s payments for Behler\u2019s personal and business interests, making Behler\u2019s decision to wade into the deal more questionable.\nCompounding these questions: Behler previously dated a now-senior employee at Guardian, who was involved in attracting new business with Paramount, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nAfter dating, the two maintained a friendly, often informal relationship at least through 2020, according to text messages reviewed by\nTRD.\nThe two shared at least one lunch at high-end restaurant Le Bernadin, in addition to other meetings \u2014 not out of bounds given the employee\u2019s role in business development \u2014 and the Paramount CEO shared internal information about his firm\u2019s property.\nIn those messages, the employee, about 30 years Behler\u2019s junior, refers to Behler as \u201cAlbertcim,\u201d using a suffix meant to show endearment in the Turkish language, with the term roughly translating to \u201cmy dear Albert.\u201d (\nTRD\nconsulted with four Turkish speakers who said this would be unusual in a professional relationship.) In a voice memo, Behler told the Guardian employee details about internal moves in a Paramount building, telling her to \u201ckeep this to herself.\u201d\nParamount\u2019s board of directors said the romantic relationship began in 2009 and ended in 2012, based on documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. (Behler disclosed the relationship to Paramount and the board of directors.)\nBehler\u2019s personal relationships would not be a matter of public concern had Paramount put the contract out for a competitive bidding process. Alternatively, Behler, who is 73 years old, could have allowed Paramount\u2019s property management team to handle minor decisions about building operations.\nA Paramount spokesperson claimed the contract was arms-length and adhered to Paramount\u2019s internal policies.\n\u201cParamount Group and its employees followed all of the company\u2019s internal policies and procedures, including conflict of interest policies, in connection with entering into an arms-length contract with Guardian Service Industries for security-related services at 60 Wall Street,\u201d a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement.\nGuardian did not return a request for comment.\nCompensation package\nAn SEC probe and questionable contracts aside, Behler\u2019s generous compensation and perks compared to his industry peers have sparked headlines and concerns.\nAn analyst at Green Street put out a report to clients earlier this year, noting there was a \u201cmisalignment\u201d between the interests of Paramount\u2019s management and shareholders, noting top executives\u2019 high pay packages relative to Paramount\u2019s returns. (Behler was paid over $20 million in compensation in 2023 plus additional benefits disclosed earlier this year.)\nIn late July, as\nTRD\nreported, Paramount disclosed in its second-quarter earnings that it was under an SEC investigation over disclosures related to executive compensation, perks, related-party transactions and conflicts of interest. In the filing, Paramount said it is cooperating with the SEC.\nThe 60 Wall contract wasn\u2019t the first time Guardian, a major player in the facility services space, attempted to do business with Paramount. In late 2024, Guardian bid on a cleaning services contract for a seven-building Paramount portfolio valued in the tens of millions. That portfolio did not include 60 Wall, according to documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. By the spring of 2025, Paramount\u2019s board did not approve Guardian\u2019s bid and the contract was awarded to another facilities firm.\nThen a smaller deal came along. One, worth just over $1 million, which did not require explicit board approval and would not even warrant a footnote in its public filings. And Behler himself directed staff to make the move.\nPrior relationship\nIn the backdrop of these transactions is the fact that Behler and a current senior manager of Guardian, who once dated but both of whom are now married to\u00a0other\u00a0people, knew each other well, something Paramount\u2019s board was aware of. The two stayed in contact and met on multiple occasions in 2019 and 2020.\nTRD\nreviewed numerous text messages between the Guardian employee and Behler, suggesting the two maintained a friendly personal relationship. This happened while the now-Guardian employee worked in a business development role for a building maintenance company that was a competitor to Guardian and had contracts with Paramount.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, Behler texted the employee: \u201cHow are you? Hope all well. Talk tomorrow?\u201d\nHer: \u201cYes please \ud83d\ude42 call me anytime xoxo\u201d\nAB: \u201ctime for lunch?\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat will be so nice to see you. Yes I am available.\u201d\nAB: \u201c12:30 le Bernadin lounge.\u201d\nHer: \u201cPerfect.\nIn February 2020, the employee texted: \u201cAlbertcim, thank you for meeting me today. If you google platinum, palladium and sterling they all have the same address. 120 Broadway.\u201d\nAB: \u201cSame here. Good to see you. Xx\u201d\nHer: \u201cXox\u201d\nThat same month, Behler sent the employee a heads-up about a recent personnel departure at 1325 Sixth Avenue of the Americas, a 34-story office tower in Manhattan. In a voice message reviewed by\nTRD,\nBehler told her that he \u201cwant[s] to talk about the 1325 thing. Keep it [to] yourself. She is going to go to another property because of a conflict they have.\u201d\nBy July, Covid had forced employees to work remotely. San Francisco, where Paramount was a prominent office owner, had put a pause on all business reopenings. The entire industry was facing an existential crisis of whether the office sector would ever recover.\nOn July 24th, 2020, the employee texted: \u201cAlbertcim just wanted to confirm we are meeting. On the 28th. I have a few important things to go over.\u201d\nAlbert Behler: \u201cYes, we do meet. Looking forward. I can do afternoon, say around 4/5 pm ok?\u201d\nThe employee: \u201cPerfect!! Looking forward to it. Let me know where we can meet. \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\nMore questions than answers\nParamount said the contract at 60 Wall does not expose it to any meaningful economic impact or risk.\n60 Wall is also the only contract between Guardian and Paramount, according to a spokesperson for Paramount. It was not an existing relationship.\nIt is an odd transaction for the firm\u2019s CEO to personally undertake, given that Paramount barely owns the property.\nThe Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC took on a 95 percent stake in 60 Wall in 2017, and Paramount, which controlled a 5 percent stake, was tasked with managing the property and day-to-day operations. Paramount became the public face of the 47-story tower.\nThe building, once home to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, is now empty and undergoing a $250 million renovation. A spokesperson for GIC directed all inquiries to Paramount. GIC said it is no longer the majority owner of the property. It is unclear whether Paramount disclosed information about the contract with Guardian and Behler\u2019s direct involvement in the deal to the building\u2019s majority owners.\nParamount is now exploring a potential sale of the company as its stock is trading under $7. It hired Bank of America as a financial advisor.\nParamount\u2019s board previously rejected two bids to sell the company, including one in February 2022, at as high as $12 a share. Once private, shareholder concerns and public disclosure will no longer be a concern.",

        "content": "Amit Goel\u2019s family office pulled $1.4 million in equity out of a Chicagoland apartment complex with a fresh round of debt.\nGoel Investments landed a $130 million loan from an affiliate of Bridge Investment Group to refinance 500 Station Apartments, a 417-unit property in Aurora, Bisnow\nreported\n, citing a Fitch Ratings presale report. The financing works out to $311,751 per unit.\nThe debt replaces a prior $130 million mortgage from\nMF1\nthat came due last year and is being rolled into a $915 million collateralized loan obligation. The financing matures in 2028 with an option to extend to 2030.\nThe loan is the largest in the CLO and was sold into the pool by an entity tied to Bridge\u2019s Debt Strategies Fund V. The Utah-based private credit shop raised $2.9 billion for its previous fund in 2022, but it has raised only $62.6 million so far toward its $2.5 billion target for the current one, SEC filings show.\n\nBuilt by Goel in 2016, 500 Station was appraised at $178 million, with an $8 million estimated net cash flow. Occupancy was 95.4 percent as of last month, helped by $500 leasing concessions to keep units filled through October. About one-third of tenants use Section 8 vouchers, a share that could grow to 50 percent under a plan Fitch said is meant to boost \u201cincome reliability and community benefit.\u201d Amenities include a pool, fitness center, golf simulator, bocce courts and a pet-washing station.\nThe property only generates enough income currently to cover 58 percent of its debt service costs, according to the loan servicer\u2019s latest reports on the\nproperty\n. The new business plan calls for rent hikes, expense stabilization and an eventual takeout with permanent financing. Aurora\u2019s multifamily market has outperformed the metro in rent growth over the past\ndecade\n, with a nearly 50 percent jump compared with 35 percent for greater Chicago, Fitch noted.\nGoel Investments, a privately held firm with more than 20 completed projects, has holdings across asset classes in multiple states. Its portfolio includes Chicago\u2019s 239-unit Rosenwald Court Apartments, the 256-unit Courthouse and Walthall Lofts in Jackson, Mississippi, and a 527-unit affordable housing portfolio along Mississippi\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Student housing in Berkeley continues to grow, with the latest offering coming from NX Ventures.\nThe Berkeley-based firm has submitted plans to build a 214-unit dorm-style student apartment building at 1899 Oxford Street, across the street from the University of California, Berkeley campus, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe project would be composed of dorm-style efficiency apartments with common kitchens, lounges and study spaces for residents on each floor. A fitness room and roof deck is also planned for the site.\nIt would include 17 very-low-income and 16 middle-income units, giving the project a 96.3 percent density bonus. The Berkeley-based developer and Trachtenberg Architects applied using SB 330, which would expedite approval process, eliminate some restrictions on housing development and limit the number of public meetings for a project.\nJust a few years ago, Berkeley\u2019s housing market was one of the most competitive in the Bay Area. UC Berkeley and private multifamily developers have sought to fill that gap, creating thousands of beds and driving down rents up to 25 percent, according to the Business Times. The university provides housing for only a quarter of its student body \u2014 the lowest rate in the UC system.\n\nNX Ventures\nis partnered with property owner Berkland Foundation to bring the Oxford Street development to life. It initially considered building housing on the site\u2019s parking lot, and before the pandemic, it was in talks with the university to either sell the property or develop it into student housing for the university.\nWith the passing of new state legislation and local zoning code changes that enabled a larger and denser project than previously planned, NX Ventures abandoned its plans with the university and filed its own plans with the city. NX and Berkland Foundation never entered a contract or development agreement with the university.\nTo make way for the project, the developer would demolish a two-story, eight-unit multifamily building owned by the Berkland Foundation and merge two lots. The residential building was used for Garber House, a professional and educational center for men, though its relocation last year a block away freed up space to increase housing capacity from 167 units to 214.\nNX Ventures\u2019 project is slated to come before the Zoning Adjustment Board in the fall. Construction on the project is estimated to begin next spring and complete in summer 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A once-struggling downtown Houston office tower is headed for a second act as apartments.\nChicago-based 3L Real Estate filed plans to convert One City Centre, at 1021 Main Street, into a 553-unit residential project, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The $26.5 million redevelopment, designed by Gensler\u2019s Houston office, is slated to start in 2026 and finish by the end of 2027.\nThe 780,530-square-foot tower will feature 93 \u201chotel apartments\u201d \u2014 corporate suites for visiting employees \u2014 on the second through sixth floors, and 460 traditional apartments on floors seven through 29.\n3L CEO Joseph Slezak said the concept is still in early stages, but the building\u2019s rectangular floor plates offer flexibility for layouts.\nThe firm specializes in turning underperforming office buildings into housing, a strategy it has deployed in more than a dozen projects nationwide.\n\nDelaware Street Capital\nbought\nOne City Centre last year from special servicer\nMidland\n, which seized the 65-year-old building from Accesso Partners after years of financial strain and more than 500,000 square feet of vacancy. The property\u2019s largest tenant, Waste Management, exited in 2020, leaving it about 90 percent empty. By 2023, annual net operating income barely topped $2,000, and its valuation plunged from $162 million in 2015 to just under $26 million a year ago.\nSlezak said 3L will pursue historic preservation credits and other tax incentives to make the numbers work. Houston\u2019s office-to-residential conversions often hinge on such subsidies, given the high costs of retrofitting older buildings for plumbing, electrical and residential amenities. Downtown Houston+, the nonprofit charged with promoting downtown, has floated an incentive program modeled after the city\u2019s prior Downtown Living Initiative, which fueled a wave of apartment development.\nOne City Centre has been on local planners\u2019 radar as a prime conversion candidate because of its large floor plates, ample parking, direct access to Houston\u2019s tunnel system and a central elevator core that leaves options for design. JLL\u2019s marketing materials projected it could hold up to 550 units averaging 900 square feet.\nIf 3L delivers, the project will add significant housing to a downtown with one of the highest\noffice vacancy\nrates in the nation \u2014 25.2 percent as of late 2023 \u2014 and join a growing national pipeline of obsolete office towers making the jump to multifamily.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It would be one of the largest luxury mixed-use developments in Southern California.\nCain is asking the city to form a Community Facilities District on the site, utilizing \u201ca public financing tool authorized under the state\u2019s Mello-Roos Act that allows for the funding of specific public infrastructure and services through special taxes on the properties that directly benefit,\u201d Jeff Muir, director of finance for the city of Beverly Hills, said.\nMuir noted the tax is only levied on the properties in the district\u2014in this case, the One Beverly Hills site. The taxes collected would repay the up to $550 million in bonds requested. Earlier this year, Cain\nsecured $300 million in mezzanine financing\nfor the project from Vici Properties.\nSpanning 17.5 acres next to the Beverly Hilton, the project calls for two new condo towers rising 412 and 453 feet and the luxury Aman hotel at 124 feet tall. Green space would include four acres of open space reserved for condo residents and 4.5 acres open to the public. Amenities include a conference center, retail and dining space.

Property owner Kennedy Wilson had paid off the interest on the $60 million loan on the property but did not amortize entirely.\nSpanning 411,100 square feet across seven buildings, the office campus saw an exodus of tenants in recent years. Occupancy rates fell from 85 percent in 2021 to 55 percent as of this May. It lost one of its largest tenants, Visual Concepts Entertainment, when its lease for 64,200 square feet expired in July. The increased vacancy ostensibly made it harder to refinance the loan, the outlet said.\nKennedy Wilson\nlisted the property for sale earlier this year, though it hasn\u2019t found a buyer yet. The Beverly Hills-based investment firm bought the 20-acre campus in 2019 for $115 million, including the $60 million loan.\nSince 2020, more than $4.1 million has been invested into the property on upgrades to the building and its amenities. This included the construction of \u201cThe Landing,\u201d an outdoor tenant amenity space.\n\nHamilton Landing was built in 1933 and was a former military base before being decommissioned in the 1970s. It holds an interesting spot in World War II history as planes from the base happened to arrive in Pearl Harbor the morning of Dec. 7, 1941.\nThe group of airplane hangars was converted into office space in 2000 by Barker Pacific Group and Prudential Real Estate Investors. The companies sank $100 million into the redevelopment.\nCurrent tenants at Hamilton Landing include video game company Take Two Interactive Software, the Marin Community Foundation, footwear brand Vionic and analytics company Fair Isaac Corporation.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "When a home sale snags a headline in\nThe Real Deal,\nit usually meets one or two points of criteria: an upper eight- or nine-figure price tag or a notable name attached.\nIt\u2019s not a hard and fast rule, but one we tend to stick to when picking which deals warrant coverage. (\nTRD\nisn\u2019t shy about its standards \u2014 columnist Erik Engquist\nlaid them out\nin an article last January.) Every now and then, a deal that doesn\u2019t fit the mold will catch our eye because of what it says about a given market, with details such as a premium flip or a major flop serving as valuable fodder for our readers.\nThen there are the record breakers.\nWe cover the obvious ones\u00a0 \u2014 the\n$60 million\nduplex that claimed the title of the most expensive condo sale in Downtown Manhattan; Ken Griffin\u2019s $238 million Billionaires\u2019 Row purchase that notched a new all-time high for the nation; an\n$80 million\nmansion on the Upper East Side that snagged the title of the priciest townhouse trade in the city.\nOther so-called record deals are less clear. Earlier this week, two Brooklyn neighborhoods nabbed record-setting deals that seem like small potatoes compared to some of Manhattan\u2019s eyebrow-raising trades.\nIn East Williamsburg, a penthouse at 28 Herbert Street sold for $3.1 million, or more than\n$1,900 a foot\n, marking the highest price per square foot achieved in the traditionally industrial neighborhood. In Greenpoint, a duplex overlooking McCarren Park traded for just under\n$6 million\n, surpassing the previous condo record holder, a $5.7 million penthouse at the Huron.\nThe deals are notable largely because they\u2019re new high-water marks in neighborhoods where prices have been steadily rising, bolstered by a pandemic-era flight to the outer boroughs and a wave of development beyond the high-priced Williamsburg waterfront.\nOn the residential beat, tracking these peak sales helps us keep tabs on where opportunity exists and which development bets, some of which are still a long ways away from hitting the market, are likely to pan out.\nIn Brooklyn especially, the likelihood of deals to reach a market-moving price varies block by block. That can be a point of contention when covering these records, as the bounds of a neighborhood can be up for debate.\nFor example, the buildings that notched the two deals this week are only just barely within the lines of Greenpoint and East Williamsburg, both teetering on the edge of Williamsburg, where prices started climbing after a rush of development in the 2000s. The neighborhood set down a benchmark unheard of in North Brooklyn with the 2021 sale of a unit at 2 Northside Piers for\n$8.3 million\n, the neighborhood\u2019s priciest condo deal to date.\nAs more development hits the market in these neighborhoods, with new prices along for the ride, they could have a\nTRD\npaper trail charting the rise.\n\nBut there are limits to how much a record has to say about a given market. As for the creative brokers or PR folks who might be reading: no, we won\u2019t be writing about the highest price per square foot achieved for a two-bedroom condo with a balcony in Brooklyn.\nNot so fast\u2026\nIt should come as a shock to no one that New York City, rents reached another record \u2014 least of all residential agents who warned the\nnew broker fee ban\nwould spike rates.\nThe latest report from Miller Samuel shows the median rent in Manhattan reached a\nrecord high\nin July, rising more than 9 percent to $4,700 per month. In Brooklyn, the metric hit its second-highest on record at $3,850, while in Northwest Queens, the median rent was $3,750.\nBut the fallout from the FARE Act, which took effect in early June, likely accounts for only a fraction of the increase, as rents have been reaching unprecedented heights since February, which is typically a slower month for the market. The sky-high prices continued into the summer, when apartments are usually in high demand and rent for top-tier rates.\nReport author Jonathan Miller said demand for rentals has risen, as high interest rates have kept some potential home buyers from pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nWith more tenants hunkering down in their apartments or searching for new ones, rental inventory fell nearly 8 percent last month compared to last July, according to data from Streeteasy. (A decline in rental listings was another consequence to the FARE Act cited by the industry in its opposition to the law.)\nThough inventory dipped citywide, some neighborhoods logged an uptick in available apartments, per\nStreetEasy\u2019s report\n. Gowanus in Brooklyn, the site of a number of new development properties following a 2021 rezoning, led the charge, with inventory more than doubling since last July. Inwood, Fort Greene and Boerum Hill followed.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a resale at Vlad Doronin\u2019s hotel-condo conversion at the Crown Building. The three-bedroom condo, Unit 16A, traded in an off-market deal for\n$28 million\n, about $4 million more than its sponsor sale price.\nThe building at 730 Fifth Avenue, known as the Aman New York, sold the last of its 22 units in January, about six years after sales launched. Its priciest deal was a $135 million penthouse that the developer bought for himself.\n",

        "content": "Ten years ago, Billionaires\u2019 Row was born.\nThe skyscrapers that dot 57th Street marry developer ambitions and the ultra-wealthy\u2019s appetite for secure, if not also flashy and headline-worthy, investments.\nBut as with all real estate acquisitions, nothing is a sure bet. Years later, some of those sky-high safety deposit boxes appear to be safer than others.\nAn analysis of public records by\nThe Real Deal\nshows the wide disparity in the returns that original buyers in five key Billionaires\u2019 Row properties received once they resold units. The analysis compares the prices achieved by sponsor sales, or the first buyers from a developer, to the first time the unit is up for sale by the original owner in five buildings: 220 Central Park South, 432 Park Avenue, 157 West 57th Street, 217 West 57th Street and 111 West 57th Street.\nThese properties are not the only addresses that comprise the slice of the city that changed the market, but are emblematic of the submarket, having been selling for long enough to show how their first buyers fared. Among trophy market observers, Billionaires\u2019 Row is generally agreed to extend beyond the stretch of 57th Street, and Billionaires\u2019 Rectangle just doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue the same.\nAs a market metric, resale performance is indicative of a systematic miscalculation by developers around the city, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller.\n\u201cThe whole premise of it was based on a mistaken assumption that the market was wide enough and deep enough for a lot of buildings to come on simultaneously,\u201d said Miller.\nUltimately it was, according to Miller, a \u201cyou had to be there\u201d moment.\n\u201cThis was a moment in time that has passed, and this submarket will be around for a long time, and there will be other buildings built, but the frenzy that the market experienced is unlikely to be repeated,\u201d he said.\nMore than 10 years after earning its moniker, Billionaires\u2019 Row presents a rather bleak picture for the current owners of these units who bought into these developments with the bet that their prices \u2014 and appeal \u2014 would keep climbing.\nCorcoran\u2019s Kane Manera, who is currently leading sales at Central Park Tower, says that there is time yet for these buildings to appreciate.\n\u201cThe time horizon of purchasing any property, 57th Street or anywhere else, shouldn\u2019t be two, three or four years \u2014 ideally you want something over five or seven years,\u201d he said, pointing to outside factors like the recent rush of new development inventory across the city.\nAssessing resale performance comes with its own quirks, where views, layouts and design can all play a role, according to Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. After taking over from the developer, a unit is at the mercy of its owner\u2019s taste.\nShe also pointed to what she called \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d when trying to assess market performance: concessions.\n\u201cA sponsor might also hang on to a price, but there might be a lot of givebacks at the end of the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often, the price that\u2019s recorded is not the actual price.\u201d\nSuch was the case with the priciest penthouse at 432 Park Avenue. The unit sold for\n$88 million in 2016\n, but only after the co-developer CIM Group provided the buyer with a $56 million loan.\nIt\u2019s often even simpler than that: newest equals best.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, it\u2019s the next new building,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Steinberg. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with these buildings or the layouts, but everyone wants new, fresh, clean and improved amenities.\u201d\nBut time comes for all buildings, and years after the developers have cashed out their chips, the legacy of these buildings will be driven by who still wants to live there \u2014 and what price they will pay to do so.\n220 Central Park South\n(Average price change: +43 percent)\nSteve Roth\u2019s 80-story limestone obelisk needs no introduction. In 2020,\nTRD\nwrote a 4,000-word paean about the \u201c\nworld\u2019s most profitable condo tower\n.\u201d\nAnd while it made its name on the strength of its sponsor sales, including the most expensive home ever sold in the country, it has solidified its standing with unrivaled resale figures. Despite the sales team raising prices a dozen times between 2015 and 2018, which in theory could hinder resales, the first-time sellers in the building have yet to take a loss.\nSteinberg said the \u201conly exception\u201d to his hot new building rule is 220 Central Park South, along with another Robert A.M. Stern-designed building, 15 Central Park West.\n\u201c220 [Central Park South] is 15 CPW on steroids,\u201d he said. \u201cRobert Stern design just holds its own in New York City.\u201d\nThe most noteworthy resale in the building came in 2022 when billionaire financier Daniel Och sold his penthouse to Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai for $188 million, more than double what Och paid for the unit in 2019.\nEven excluding that outlier trade, the building has still on average had resale units go for 36 percent above their sponsor sale price.\n432 Park Avenue\n(Average price change: +2.3 percent)\nHarry Macklowe\u2019s slim supertall on the eastern end of Billionaires\u2019 Row, which launched sales in 2013, is the only other building on this list with a positive performance in the resale market, if just barely.\nThe 125-unit building has been trending in the wrong direction in recent years, however.\nOf the building\u2019s first 13 resales, which spanned 2017 and 2018, only three went for less than the buyer originally paid. Those trades included a two-bedroom on the 53rd floor that sold for $10.8 million, up 80 percent from the original price.\nWith its unique Rafael Vi\u00f1oly-designed facade, towering views and high-end amenities, the\n\nsales team at the building still discounted units when other buildings started popping up \u201cbecause they could see the tsunami of supply coming,\u201d Miller said, which helped steady the boat.\nIts success in resales has largely played out in the background of complaints from tenants, as Miller said, \u201cputting aside all the litigation that seems to be going on.\u201d\nThat litigation includes two separate lawsuits filed by the 432 Park Avenue condo board. The first,\nfiled in 2021\n, alleged construction defects including flooding, broken elevators and noise from the building\u2019s sway. The board\nsued again this year\n, claiming Macklowe and CIM Group knew about the alleged defects.\nCompounding possible effects from the original lawsuit was a preceding deluge of luxury condos that had hit the market and fallout from the pandemic.\nOn average, sales by original buyers since 2021 went for almost 1 percent less than they paid for their sponsor units. And of the 16 units resold for the first time since 2021, 10 went for a loss.\nThe largest dollar value drop came after billionaire financier Thomas Peterffy sold his 84th-floor unit for $13.5 million in 2024, almost 40 percent less than what he paid for it in 2016.\nBut that unit, outfitted with patterned gray rugs and chromatically-tiled walls, points to an issue in assessing resale performance in condo buildings that Olshan pointed out when I called her for this story: \u201cthere\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d\n157 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -24.2 percent)\nGary Barnett\u2019s glass tower, dubbed One57, holds a couple of titles: the first Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, the most sales by original owners and the steepest drop in resale prices among the five condo buildings.\nFor a short period, One57 was in a league of its own when it launched sales in 2011. Billionaire financier Bill Ackman purchased a duplex penthouse for $91.5 million in 2012, setting the record for the city\u2019s priciest sale. But before that deal could close, Dell Technologies CEO and founder Michael Dell one-upped him with a $100 million penthouse purchase in the building that closed in 2014, one year before Ackman\u2019s deal hit city records.\nBut the tower was a\nvictim of its own success\n, spawning its successors that place above it on this list.\n\u201cIt was the tallest condo building ever built,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Ryan Kaplan. \u201cWe were all enamored by it, and now, when you look at the 57th Street skyline, it gets dwarfed.\u201d\nThe first two sellers out of the building \u2014 one in 2014 and one in 2015 \u2014 netted tidy margins of 11 and 21 percent, respectively. Those sales came right as the condo market began to turn with a glut of inventory, and buyers began eying newer offerings like 432 Park Avenue and 220 Central Park South.\nSince then, a staggering 32 of the next 35 sales by original owners have traded for losses. One57 also has the 10 steepest discounts in absolute dollars of the buildings on this list.\nSome owners did not even try to recoup their losses, and still couldn\u2019t get their asking price. The seller of an 81st-floor unit, who bought the apartment for $55.5 million, listed the home for $42 million in April 2021. It ultimately sold for $35.5 million later that year.\nBut a few bargain hunters who scooped up discounted resale units have managed to turn a profit. Last year, investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Robert Herjavec\nsold his condo for $39 million\nfor a 21 percent gain from what he paid in 2021.\nThe lackluster resales also haven\u2019t discouraged some intrepid owners in the building. The buyer of two 64th-floor units, which cost a total of $46 million, listed the combined full-floor unit for\n$90 million in June\n.\n111 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -16.6 percent)\n217 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -9.7 percent)\nWe\u2019re lumping together two buildings that can\u2019t quite make it on the resale list on their own because they\u2019re still churning through sponsor sales.\nBoth buildings launched sales in 2018 as the luxury condo market had turned back into a pumpkin.\nAnother Barnett project, 217 West 57th Street, known as Central Park Tower, is what Miller described as the other bookend, along with One57, to the Billionaires\u2019 Row phenomenon.\nThe tower, which was over two-thirds sold in December according to a\nTRD\nanalysis, has become well-known for its hefty sponsor discounts. It has still managed to achieve some of the city\u2019s priciest sales, including a\n$115 million penthouse\nthat closed in June 2024 (don\u2019t ask about the\n$250 million penthouse\n).\nThe building has recorded just three resales, two of which traded at almost exactly their initial sale price. The third,\na $40 million sale in June\n, went for $6 million less than the seller paid only six months prior.\nAt 111 West 57th Street, where the development team of JDS Development and Property Markets Group spent nearly half a decade wading through legal challenges, things have started to turn around under Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nikki Field, who took over sales of the building\u2019s final 27 units last summer.\nThe 59-unit tower was down to its last 10 units in April, likely aided by the aggressive price cuts Field has taken since taking over.\nThe building has seen just two sales by original owners, one of which went for 2 percent over its original sale price of $9.3 million. The other, which the seller bought for $26 million in 2022, was listed for $24.5 million last year and sold for $20.4 million in June.",

        "content": "Most people don\u2019t think of an \u201cemergency\u201d as a permanent condition.\nYet the \u201chousing emergencies\u201d that triggered rent stabilization in New York City and other localities in the state have never ended. Most have lasted for decades.\nUntil now.\nKingston just ran its second housing survey and found a\n7 percent vacancy rate\n, up from\n1.6 percent\nin its initial survey. Under state law, rent stabilization is not allowed if the rate is above 5 percent.\nFans of rent control were incredulous \u2014 and outraged. Sarahana Shrestha, the Hudson Valley\u2019s socialist Assembly member, called it \u201c\nabsolute nonsense\n.\u201d\nBut the study was unquestionably more accurate than the first one, which was rigged to come in under 5 percent. Properties that did not answer the\n2022 survey\nwere assumed to be 100 percent occupied. (Somehow it survived a legal challenge by landlords, whose own survey showed a 6.2 percent vacancy rate.)\nShrestha says vacancy over 5 percent doesn\u2019t mean there is no housing emergency. She authored a bill that would create other justifications for rent regulation. I doubt Gov. Kathy Hochul would sign it, should it somehow pass the legislature.\nKingston is a small city, but what happens with rent stabilization there has implications for landlords and tenants across the state. So, what are the lessons here?\nThe median rent has doubled in Kingston since 2016 because virtually no homes have been built there this century. Only 5 percent of its homes are newer than 25 years old. When demand to live in the Hudson Valley spiked during the pandemic, so did rents.\nKingston\u2019s median home value tripled during the same period. But no one suggested homeowners be prevented from selling to the highest bidder. The city only imposed price caps on landlords.\nThe city has finally taken steps to allow more homes, and developers have responded: More than 600 units are in the pipeline, the most since the 1970s. That is the best way to keep prices down.\nThe 7 percent vacancy rate does not mean Kingston will abandon rent stabilization. Look for the city to apply it to older buildings with 22 or more units, which were found to have a vacancy rate of 3.7 percent.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSomeone on X tweeted that Andrew Cuomo\u2019s proposal for rent stabilization is at least better than the current system. I\nreplied\n, \u201cThat\u2019s like saying swimming with sharks is a better idea than playing in traffic.\u201d Do you agree? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: PTAC stands for packaged terminal air conditioner \u2014 a self-contained heating and cooling unit typically installed through a wall. PTAC units are considered inferior to mini-splits and central air, which are quieter and more efficient (although PTAC technology has improved significantly). Thanks to reader Simone Joy Friedman for sharing the acronym.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nCity Council member Carlina Rivera is the new president and CEO of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing. Rivera represented the 2nd District, covering the Lower East Side and surrounding areas, and was due to be term-limited out at the end of this year.\n\u2014\nAndrew Cuomo refused to release a list of his private consulting clients, citing attorney-client privilege, after Assembly member Zohran Mamdani challenged him to do so in a video linking Cuomo to controversial figures and undisclosed financial dealings,\namNY\nreported. A back-and-forth between the two mayoral candidates began last week when Cuomo criticized Mamdani for living in a $2,300 rent-stabilized apartment despite his $142,000 salary.\n\u2014\nThe MTA is set to award a $1.9 billion contract to Connect Plus Partners to bore tunnels and build two new Harlem stations as part of the extension of the Second Avenue subway,\nCrain\u2019s New York Business\nreported. Construction is set to begin by the end of the year, bringing the Q line further into East Harlem.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10.5 million\nfor 57 Wyckoff Street. The Cobble Hill townhome is 7,000 square feet and last sold in 2022 for $9.4 million. Serhant had the\nlisting\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$125.6 million\nfor a portfolio of units at 569 Lexington Avenue.

        "content": "Big titles, turnover and dysfunction. Malibu\u2019s revolving door of key staffers could be cause for concern as the community faces recovery from two massive fires.\nFormer Planning Director Richard Mollica resigned last July, replaced by Maureen Tamuri on an interim basis. Tamuri held that spot through June.\nMeanwhile, former City Manager Steve McClary had been away since Thanksgiving \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d when he and the city announced March 11 an \u201camicable transition.\u201d\nIn April, Alexis Brown, who served as an acting deputy city manager, resigned in April, while McClary\u2019s successor Joseph Toney gave notice in May \u201cafter much deliberation and reflection.\u201d\nRonda Perez is now the incoming Malibu city manager, effective Aug. 25, the city announced late last month. She\u2019ll play a key role in the day-to-day operations as the city continues to sort through recovery from the 2018 Woolsey Fire and January\u2019s Palisades Fire.\nPerez hails from about an hour-and-20-minute drive northeast of\nMalibu\n, where she was the former manager of Palmdale and also an assistant city manager of Lancaster. She\u2019s credited with securing state and federal funding for infrastructure projects and parks, in addition to downtown revitalization projects.\nHow that translates to\nwildfire rebuilding\n, developers and residents are watching and waiting to see. So far, no\nbuilding permits\nhave been issued thus far on rebuild projects from the Palisades Fire, which wiped out more than 700 homes.\nIn welcoming Perez, Malibu Mayor Marianne Riggins may have put it best when she said \u201cconsistent and capable leadership is essential\u201d as the city rebuilds.\nPermit race\nSpeaking of getting things done with \u201cconsistent and capable leadership,\u201d one can\u2019t help crunching the numbers here on\npermitting\npost-wildfires, now that the seven-month mark has passed.\nThe numbers, how they\u2019re reported and how often offers one crisp way of gauging government efficiency and\ntransparency\n. Here\u2019s a quick pull of the data:\nMalibu\nHomes Destroyed: 700+\nPermits Issued: 0\nBuilding Plan Check: 1 approved, 7 submissions\nSource: City data as of Aug. 14\nPalisades\nHomes Damaged/Destroyed: 6,200\nPermits Issued: 165+\nSource: City of Los Angeles as of July 7\nAltadena/Pasadena\nHomes Damaged/Destroyed: 6,656\nPermits Issued: 139 (Altadena and other parts of unincorporated L.A. County), 4 (Pasadena)\n\nSource: Pasadena city data, Los Angeles County as of Aug. 14\nBig buyer on the beaches\nAll the resi buzz this week centered on a mystery buyer scooping up burned lots in Malibu.\nSo far, the overseas investor purchased\nnine lots for $65 million\non Carbon and La Costa beaches.\nThe alarm bells started sounding from some locals who were incensed by a single developer buying multiple parcels.\nFor those who have dealt in the past with the permit process, and simply want Malibu rebuilt quickly, the purchases were viewed as welcome deals.\n\u201cIn the news, it was such a negative spin on this developer and how could the city let someone come in and buy all these lots,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Russell Grether. \u201cIt was such a negative tone, but at the same time, to me, it was a vote of confidence that we will recover and there\u2019s somebody out there to have the audacity to not just buy one but [more than] half a dozen [lots].\u201d\nCaruso\u2019s old Beverly Hills pad yields $48M\nIt\u2019s been a little quiet on the big-deal front in Beverly Hills of late.\nRick Caruso\u2019s old pad on Benedict Canyon Drive, about a block away from the Beverly Hills Hotel, broke the silence.\nIn late July, the over 17,000-square-foot new build on\n912 Benedict Canyon Drive\nsold for $47.5 million.\nWestside Estate Agency nabbed business on both sides, with the brokerage\u2019s agents representing the seller and buyer.\nThere\u2019s not a lot more to tell beyond that. Both buyer and seller are hidden behind shell companies. The seller is RFG-Lavender, registered in Delaware. Murray Hill Real Estate LLC is the buyer.\nDubrows get $17M for Beverly Hills French Normandy estate\nHeather and Terry Dubrow\ndidn\u2019t get exactly what they wanted from the sale of their Beverly Hills home, but a lot of sellers aren\u2019t these days.\nThe reality TV couple, known for their roles in \u201cThe Real Housewives of Orange County\u201d and \u201cBotched,\u201d sold 1501 Tower Grove for $16.5 million. The Dubrows tried for $25 million when they hung up the for-sale sign on the nearly 9,000-square-foot residence in March.\nIt\u2019s been a lot of that of late \u2013 homes not selling for close to ask.\nSome agents say it\u2019s a sign of the challenging luxury market. Others say that\u2019s more a function of incorrect initial pricing.\nPay $75M to live in Ricky Martin\u2019s former home\nSpeaking of pricing, Compass\u2019 Carl Gambino will test the luxury market\u2019s appetite for his\n$75 million\nBeverly Hills listing.\nThe property at 1309 Davies Drive hit the market this week. Part of the pitch: the home was owned at different times by Ricky Martin, Michael Caine and the family of Doris Day.\nAside from a glitzy owner lineage, there\u2019s also the possibility of running into any one of the titans of industry that live nearby while out walking the dog.\nThe Pritzker Estate, which Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker is trying to sell for $175 million, is about 10 minutes away. There\u2019s also Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s Bel-Air mansion at 875 Nimes Road, also known as Chartwell Estate.\n",

        "content": "A Nuveen affiliate just made a big bet on suburban Chicago apartments, paying $87.8 million for Uptown La Grange \u2014 the priciest rental property trade in the west suburb\u2019s history.\nNuveen Real Estate\u2019s U.S. Cities Multifamily bought the 254-unit complex at 31 East Ogden Avenue from Oak Brook-based JVM Realty, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The price amounts to $345,700 per unit. It\u2019s the second suburban pickup for the investment manager in less than a year, following its $65 million buy of the 167-unit\nDash Downers Grove\nin October.\nThe sale price is slightly below the $89.4 million JVM paid in 2019. CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi and Jason Zyck repped JVM in the deal. No mortgage was recorded, suggesting Nuveen may have paid cash.\nThe five-story building, completed in 2017, is the only large apartment complex built in La Grange since 1970 and the only Class A asset in the village, CBRE marketing materials said. Units range from studios to three-bedrooms, with average rents of $2,530 per month, or $2.64 per square foot \u2014 above the suburban median of $2.14, per Integra Realty Resources. Suburban Chicago\u2019s apartment market is tight, with 97.8 percent occupancy and rents up 4 percent year-over-year amid high construction costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nInvestors have been circling well-leased suburban rentals as urban rent growth cools. CBRE\u2019s pitch to buyers hinted there\u2019s still room to push rents through upgrades.\nThe deal comes amid other sizable suburban trades:\nValley Lo Towers\nin Glenview fetched $45.5 million in June, while Mount Prospect\u2019s Top of the Mount sold for roughly $60 million in April.\nThe sale is another signal that the institutional capital that once chased urban trophy towers is increasingly looking\noutside\nthe urban core in search of stable income and limited competition.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After eight years of hand wringing, Dallas City Council approved a contentious rezoning plan for 35 acres in West Oak Cliff, a largely Hispanic neighborhood west of downtown.\nThe 12-3 vote Wednesday opened the area up to denser development near Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive, but it\u2019s reigniting fears of displacement in one of the city\u2019s most culturally distinct commercial corridors, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe city-led initiative targeted an area with roughly a quarter of its commercial lots sitting vacant, aiming to attract multifamily and retail development. The measure also bans fast food drive-thrus and caps building heights at 45 feet.\nThe council acted just in time, according to supporters: a new state zoning law,\nSenate Bill 840\n, takes effect Sept. 1, allowing multifamily development on all commercially zoned land in Texas cities. Council Member Chad West, who represents the district, called the rezoning \u201ca long-awaited win\u201d that preserves more local control than the looming state mandate.\nMany locals aren\u2019t buying it. Members of La Alianza, a coalition of corridor business owners, argued that the rezoning will accelerate gentrification, driving out Latino-owned restaurants, auto shops and salons. Residents likened the move to past rezonings in\nBishop Arts\nand Trinity Groves that transformed \u2014 and, in their view, erased \u2014 the character of long-established communities.\n\nAttorney and resident Christine Hopkins said rezoning would invite luxury housing that\u2019s out of step with the working-class neighborhood. But West said that existing businesses will be grandfathered in, with new rules applying only if they expand or relocate.\nThe council adopted two of La Alianza\u2019s three requests \u2014 reducing\nheight limits\nand a ground-floor retail requirement \u2014 but stopped short of creating an anti-displacement task force. West said he\u2019s working with City Manager Kim Tolbert to form one.\nThe rezoning won backing from five of six neighborhood associations in the area. William Roth, one of three council members who voted no, said he\u2019s worried about residents losing influence over the future of their neighborhood.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two value haircuts and a discounted sale. That\u2019s the news out of a distressed Los Angeles office sector.\nLet\u2019s start downtown, where it hurts the most.\nThe 21-story Wedbush Center was recently\nappraised\nat $60.5 million compared with a $197.5 million value at loan issuance. That\u2019s a 69 percent decrease in seven years, meaning the office tower is worth less than half the $128 million debt connected to it and less than the $196 million Cerberus Capital Management purchased it for.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities debt backing the Class A offices at 1000 Wilshire Boulevard landed in special servicing after missing a March maturity date. Occupancy has slumped at the 475,000-square-foot office building, to 67 percent at the end of last year compared to 87 percent at loan underwriting.\nAnd although the special servicer is reviewing resolution alternatives, the vacancy rate may worsen at the Wedbush Center. The building\u2019s largest tenant, that shares its name, plans to vacate the premises once its lease expires at the end of the year: Wedbush Securities is ditching its 100,000 square feet of space after two decades.\nEyes on the clock\nNow to Santa Monica. The Santa Monica Clock Tower was recently\nappraised\nat $27.4 million compared to $49 million at loan issuance. That\u2019s a 44 percent drop in around a decade and puts the office tower\u2019s value under the $58 million Rockwood Capital paid for it six years ago.\nThe value drop comes after the $26.7 million CMBS loan connected to the offices went to special servicing after missing a May maturity date. But because the borrower is responsive and the value is still above the debt balance, there may be room for modification.\nOnce the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper, the century-old, 12-story Art Deco office property, has seen its occupancy plummet to 43 percent in March this year versus 100 percent at loan underwriting ten years ago. The 53,500-square-foot office building at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard is not bringing in enough money to pay off debts.\nOn sale\nAnd our last stop: Pasadena.\n\nSwift Real Estate Partners\nsold\na nine-story office tower to GD Realty at about an 47 percent loss, for $31.5 million.\nThe property at 790 East Colorado Boulevard was part of a three-building office complex in Pasadena that Swift Real Estate partners purchased for $193 million six years ago. The offices at 790 East Colorado Boulevard were purchased for $59 million, property records reveal. The 146,000-square-foot office building is 70 percent leased.\nThe three properties were collectively known as \u201cThe Pasadena Collection,\u201d and span 517,000 square feet. The two other properties were a 212,000 square-foot building at 155 North Lake Avenue, and a 159,000 square-foot building at 35 North Lake Avenue.\nSlam dunk\nBasketball brothers-turned-developers\nscored\n$46.6 million in construction financing for an apartment development in Echo Park.\nNBA star Tobais Harris, who plays for the Detroit Pistons, and Visionary Developments\u2019 Terry Harris, who played in a developmental league, secured senior and mezzanine debt from JP Morgan and BlueHub Capital.\nThe development totals about 86,500 square feet. The 189 apartments at 1540 West Court Street are deed-restricted at 80 percent, meaning households can only earn up to 80 percent of the median income; in Los Angeles County that would be $84,500 for a single person, $96,950 for two and so on \u2014 and the project benefits from Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1, which aims to streamline the approval process for affordable housing.\nThe Harris brothers have two other Echo Park apartment developments: one at 1230 West Sunset Boulevard that is under planning review and another at 333 Douglas Street that is under construction.\nStalled project finds suiters\nThe bankrupt, half-baked Oceanwide Plaza at the center of Downtown Los Angeles has two bidders,\naccording to\nits broker, Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski. Both bidders are developers, one is from abroad.\nAfter would-be buyers couldn\u2019t come up with the cash, Tarczynski says they now have to show money to talk. That means $450 million to purchase the entitled site and $1 billion to complete it. That\u2019s despite the $1.2 billion that was spent on construction.\n\u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d Tarczynski said.\nConstruction on the unfinished, mixed-use, 1.5-million-square-foot project covered in graffiti began a decade ago. It became two half-built towers before landing in bankruptcy due to financial issues. Everything has been on hold since January 2019; the project faced foreclosure in 2023 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year.\nBut Tarczynski anticipates the deal to close by the end of the year \u2014 although he had previously hoped it would happen before the second quarter.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy win\nA Los Angeles judge\nfound in favor\nof developer Leo Pustilnikov after he sued Beverly Hills for attempting to block a 19-story mixed-use development on Linden Drive.\nThe proposed project, which includes apartments, hotel rooms and a restaurant, was one of the first in Beverly Hills to put builder\u2019s remedy to use. The legal mechanism allows developers to bypass local planning boards and zoning when localities\u2019 housing plans fail to comply with state-mandated goals.\nThe ruling could have an effect on other housing developments that have been proposed in recent years through builder\u2019s remedy, but were still held up by the city.\n\u201cThis puts the wind at our back and sends a message clear as day. The city cannot rely on specious legal arguments to delay and deny a developer\u2019s vested rights.\u201d Dave Rand, an attorney for Pustilnikov, said.\n",

        "content": "It was a tale of two office markets in New York this week.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue\nreceived a valuation\nof $41 million, a significant drop from its $300 million valuation in 2015. The building\u2019s occupancy and net operating income have declined, leading to a foreclosure case.\nCohen\u2019s personal net worth has decreased in parallel and his troubles continue as he faces a separate $187 million judgment from Fortress Capital.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Scott Rechler closed a\n$1 billion deal\nfor 590 Madison Avenue with a big private equity loan, New York City\u2019s largest investment sale in three years. Mark Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management provided $785 million in debt to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of the Plaza District office tower from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nThere was some drama, as Rechler signed a contract to buy the building in May, with a closing deadline set for July 31. RXR needed more time to lock in financing and received a two-week extension, for which the company had to pay a $5 million fee that was added onto the final purchase price.\nIn a major moment for New York City development, the NYC City Council approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan,\nrezoning\n42 blocks.\n\nThis is the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years, projected to add 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 designated as affordable. The rezoning introduces new residential districts and utilizes Mandatory Inclusionary Housing for the first time in Midtown Manhattan, part of Eric Adams\u2019 Manhattan Plan.\nOn the Upper West Side, UDR and MetLife are\nlooking to sell\na five-building, 710-unit multifamily portfolio near Columbus Circle for $450 million to $500 million.\nThe portfolio is being marketed as resistant to potential rent freezes due to four buildings being free market and the fifth having significant rent increase potential under the 421a program, an intriguing offering for investors amid concerns about Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments.\nAnd finally, Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s YS Developers\nis moving ahead\nwith a controversial project at 960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, planning 300 condo units with a projected sellout of $273 million. The seven-story building will include one to two-bedroom condos, with prices starting under $600,000 for a one-bedroom and reaching approximately $1.6 million for a two-bedroom on the top floor.\nThe development comes after years of disputes and rejected proposals for the site, including earlier plans by Bruce Eichner for significantly taller towers that were opposed due to concerns about shadowing the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\n",

        "content": "Despite institutional investors lining up to sell downtown Chicago apartment towers amid solid rent growth, there\u2019s plenty of CRE distress in the pipeline.\nMoshe Wechsler\u2019s\nEmerald Empire is in forbearance\non a big chunk of debt tied to a $600 million purchase of Pangea Properties\u2019 400-building rental portfolio. The 2022 deal made Emerald one of Chicago\u2019s largest apartment landlords, but rising interest rates and shaky property conditions preceded the landlord\u2019s request for a break on payments toward $430 million in Fannie Mae financing. City officials have flagged multiple code violations at Emerald\u2019s buildings, while it remains unclear exactly how much of the large debt package is affected.\nElsewhere in multifamily,\nChikoo Patel and partner Shai Wolkowicki are under siege\nfrom lenders and investors for nearly $20 million tied to deals from Chicago to Springfield. Patel, who drew tenant ire earlier this year over property conditions in South Shore, is accused of fraud and embezzlement in one case while Old National Bank is pursuing foreclosure on a $16 million downstate deal. Other lawsuits are stacking up, from HUD-funded projects to smaller South Side apartments, spotlighting the\nrisks of opportunistic plays\nin distressed housing.\n\nIn the South Loop,\nlender ACORE Capital filed a $187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst longtime hotel operator Su-Mei Yen, whose family controls the Best Western Grant Park and the Homewood Suites on Wabash. The suit alleges missed deposits and unpaid fees on a loan that\u2019s now swelling by $60,000 a day. Additionally,\nChinese EB-5 investors expanded a fraud lawsuit against the Yens to $18 million\n, claiming their funds were misused and their visa hopes derailed.\nIt\u2019s brighter in the residential market of Lake Geneva, where wealthy buyers are circling waterfront homes \u2014 even when\nthey\u2019re off the market\n. A six-bedroom home in the Wisconsin getaway\u2019s South Shore Club sold after an\nunsolicited $10.1 million offer\nended the buyer\u2019s two-year search. It\u2019s the latest in a string of eight-figure trades on the lake, underscoring the\nMidwest\u2019s strengthening pull for trophy-home buyers\n.\nPlus, downtown Chicago\u2019s high-rise multifamily market is a magnet.\nBrookfield listed its 502-unit Sky55\nand an adjacent senior building on South Michigan Avenue, while the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio\nput its 481-unit Streeterville tower on the block\n. Both properties are heavily occupied with rising rents, joining other large complexes recently listed as\ninstitutional players test pricing\nin a supply-starved market.",

There\u2019s also\npickleball\nfrenzy, and private\npadel courts\npopping up in places like Billionaire\u2019s Row in New York City.\nIn Texas, fitness and entertainment concepts have kept\nretail real estate vacancy\nat historic lows, while major retailers like Big Lots, Conn\u2019s and Joanns folded.\nThe vacancy rate halfway through the year was lower than the 20-year historic average in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Partners Real Estate.\nAmong the big backfillers is Dallas-based EoS Fitness, which was\nfounded in 2014\nbut has blown up in the past few years. It has 175 locations across the country and plans to expand to 250 gyms by 2030. The company was acquired by San Francisco private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in May.\nEoS is redeveloping a 45,000-square-foot former Fiesta Mart store at 8040 Ferguson Road in Dallas, and it had four other projects in the works across Texas last year, according to Weitzman.\nFitness is also the hook for Houston-based apartment developer Define Living. The firm, led by CEO and founder Henry Richardson, bought one of the last undeveloped parcels in\nHouston\u2019s Energy Corridor\n. The firm is planning a 388-unit complex on the 10.2-acre tract, which it bought from Wolff Companies. The four-story complex will be built near planned city trails and include a gym, infrared sauna, cold plunge, bicycle spa and \u201ca personal wellbeing coach for every resident.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, brokers are getting in their reps within the fitness sector.\nElsewhere in Texas real estate this week\u2026\nAshford Hospitality Trust, led by Dallas investor Monty Bennett, is facing financial distress after defaulting on a\n$590 million hotel portfolio loan\n, failing to secure refinancing before a forbearance period expired. The 18-property portfolio, primarily in Texas, has seen declining occupancy and has been in and out of special servicing since 2020. Although Ashford recently received a loan extension until January and the portfolio was appraised at $1.1 billion, its financial challenges persist amid ongoing efforts to refinance.\nSterling Bay abandoned its plans for a $100 million, 13-story office project in Deep Ellum after\nselling the 2.7-acre site\nto an unidentified entity called Dos Hombres Ventures. The Chicago-based developer, facing mounting financial challenges and setbacks with its Lincoln Yards project, has been offloading real estate, including multiple properties in Chicago.\nAustin-based developer American Ventures is proposing a $557 million, 100-acre\nmixed-use project in San Marcos\nand is seeking city support through a public improvement district, zoning changes and potential tax abatements. The development would include more than 1,600 residential units, a hotel and more than 140,000 square feet of office and retail space, with completion planned by 2031.\nA 1,000-home master-planned community called Holly Ridge is being developed in rural Fort Bend County, about 7 miles west of Rosenberg, by\nSignorelli Company and D.R. Horton\n. Spanning 359 acres, the project will offer homes priced between $300,000 and $450,000 and include 133 acres of outdoor amenities. It reflects a broader trend of developers expanding into the outer edges of the Houston metro area amid a slowdown in master-planned community sales.\nActress Emma Stone sold her\nrenovated seven-bedroom mansion in Austin\u2019s Tarrytown\nneighborhood without ever moving in, choosing instead to remain in New York City with her husband, Dave McCary. The couple bought the 1.24-acre property off-market in 2021 with plans to relocate but changed course, listing it for $26.5 million before cutting the price to $23.5 million. If sold at the asking price, it would rank among the most expensive residential sales in Austin.\n",

        "content": "The cycle for new multifamily construction is ending, and owners of multifamily development sites are looking for an out.\nIt makes sense. Many developers are putting their sites up for sale following a period of rapid growth fueled by the pandemic boom. Then came the slowdown, brought by unsustainable costs for land, financing and construction.\nOn top of that, developers have to offer more concessions to tenants to lease units at their buildings, commercial broker Tony Arellano\ntells Lidia Dinkova\n. A deluge of completed projects in 2023 and 2024 suppressed rent growth. And rents are falling in some neighborhoods.\nDevelopers deny that high costs are why they\u2019re listing their sites.\n\u201cSome of these guys bought at the top of the market. They were overleveraged, and they thought everything ws going to keep being peachy, that the rents would be peachy, that with Trump being in power, interest rates would have dropped,\u201d said Miguel Pinto of Apex Capital Realty. \u201cNone of that has happened.\u201d\nAnd not all of them are publicly listing their sites. But they would sell if the price makes sense.\nSebastian Faerman, a commercial broker at Fortune Christie\u2019s, said developers who didn\u2019t have shovels in the ground a couple of months ago will not be going vertical this cycle.\nStill, some of the properties are owned by land-bankers who never planned to actually build. Their business model is to buy, entitle and flip \u2014 this includes those tapping the state\u2019s new workforce housing law, the Live Local Act, to boost their site\u2019s density and height allowance.\nIn Wynwood, Clara Homes listed its site, home to the former Austin Burke menswear store, for nearly $11 million. Clara paid $7.7 million for the nearly half-acre site, filed plans for a Live Local project, and secured approval for the 22-story, 147-unit tower. But Clara, led by James Curnin, switched course with the listing.\nCurnin agreed that Wynwood has high inventory, but he said that\u2019s not why he listed the Clara Wynwood site. He also cited issues with a strung-out site plan approval process, one many developers complain about.\n\u201cI just want to move to bigger and better things,\u201d said Curnin.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nBillionaire Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow (and partners) took a\nmajority stake\nin Chetrit Group\u2019s Miami River development, one megaproject we\u2019ve been tracking for a decade. What does this deal say about the market? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Patrick K. Willis sold a single-family home at 2900 Northeast 37th Street in Fort Lauderdale\nfor $27.4 million\nto former race car driver and racing company owner Michael Andretti. Willis, who owns a repo company, paid $12.5 million for the nearly 14,000-square-foot mansion in 2021.\nCommercial\n: Private credit firm Favo Capital\npaid $190 million\nfor the 22-story, 277-unit apartment tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. GCF Development, a Hollywood-based firm led by Charles \u201cChip\u201d Abele, obtained a long-term equity stake in Favo as part of the all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nSpec home developer Todd Michael Glaser and the Posner Group are looking to flip for\n$169 million\nthe waterfront Miami Beach estate they bought for $105 million in July. They also listed the 2.3-acre estate at 5940 North Bay Road for rent, asking $495,000 a month. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listings.

        "content": "The Bay Area hotel market\u2019s hotel woes are piling up.\nTwo of the biggest hotels in San Francisco, the Hilton Union Square and Parc 55, are expected to sell in foreclosure in the latest distressed lodging sale in the Bay Area. The Hilton Union Square, at 333 O\u2019Farrell Street, is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms; the Parc 55, a Hilton property at 55 Cyril Magnin Street, is among the top five with 1,024 rooms, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n.\nThe foreclosures come after Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, an affiliate of Hilton Worldwide Holdings,\ndefaulted on its $725 million mortgage\non the properties in 2023. Earlier this month, a judge approved a request to extend a court-appointed receiver\u2019s ability to sell the properties until Oct. 29, marking the fourth time the sale deadline has been extended.\nThe past year has been rough, to say the least, for\nhotels across the Bay Area\ntrying to stay afloat as foreclosures and loan defaults abound.\nLast month, lender Invesco took back the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\nin a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million, or $140,400 per key. That was preceded in May by\nBrightSpire Capital\u2019s seizure\nof the 541-room Signia by Hilton in downtown\nSan Jose\nin a foreclosure valuing the property at $80 million, under $148,000 per key. In October, the 162-room Courtyard Oakland Downtown sold for $10.6 million, just $65,400 per key and a 76 percent drop from its prior value.\nForeclosure claimed the 142-room\nHyatt House Pleasant Hill\nin June, while the 128-room Hyatt House Pleasanton was seized through foreclosure the month prior. In April, the dual-branded AC Hotel and Residence Inn in downtown Oakland went back to lenders in a streamlined foreclosure process after Hawkins Way Capital defaulted on a $112 million loan tied to the property. At the same time, the 112-room Hyatt Place/Newark Silicon Valley is in default and could be taken by its lender through a foreclosure.\nIn Berkeley, Kubera Hotel Properties\u2019 113-room\nUniversity Inn &amp; Suites in Berkeley\nwent into foreclosure in June. Down south in San Jose, a two-hotel complex consisting of a Motel 6 and a Super 8 by Wyndham defaulted on a $21.7 million loan.\nSome hotels have closed their doors entirely. Last summer, the\nHilton Oakland Airport Hotel\nshut down abruptly, while in January, the 145-room Waterfront Hotel in Oakland\u2019s Jack London Square also suddenly shuttered. The Radisson Oakland Airport has also permanently closed.\nHotel sales\nin California dropped 7.4 percent in the first six months of the year from the same period the year prior, according to Atlas Hospitality Group. In the Bay Area, the largest hotel sales in Alameda County and Santa Clara County in the first half of the year were foreclosure sales: The Oakland Marriott City Center and Signia by Hilton in San Jose.\nMark Zuckerberg\nangers neighbors\nResidents of Palo Alto\u2019s Crescent Park neighborhood are hopping mad at neighbor Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe Meta CEO dropped more than $110 million on at least 11 houses next to each other in the tree-filled neighborhood since moving there in 2011. He constructed a compound across five of those parcels, while other buildings are used for things like parties and an unpermitted private school. Underground, Zuckerberg and his family have access to 7,000 square feet of so-called basement space, which neighbors regard as a bunker.\nZuckerberg\u2019s neighbors are\nspeaking out\nabout their experiences sharing their environment with one of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\u201cNo neighborhood wants to be occupied,\u201d neighbor Michael Kieschnick, whose home is tucked between Zuckerberg-owned lots,\ntold\nthe New York Times. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood.\u201d\nThe city of Palo Alto has seemingly allowed Zuckerberg\u2019s unfettered expansion in the area, purportedly going so far as to let him get around local regulations and even have police block off street parking used by residents.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been finding loopholes around our local laws and zoning ordinances,\u201d Greer Stone, a member of the Palo Alto City Council, told the outlet. \u201cWe should never be a gated, gilded city on a hill where people don\u2019t know their neighbors.\u201d\nKirschnick put it more bluntly: \u201cBillionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules \u2014 Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique, except that they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a mystery why the city has been so feckless.\u201d\nGSA closes office campus sale\n\nThe General Services Administration has completed its sale of the\nRockaway Grove\noffice campus in Menlo Park.\nSan Francisco-based developer Presidio Bay bought the 17-acre property, previously occupied by the U.S. Geological Survey, for $137 million. The sale comes as the GSA is reducing office space across the country following the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s headcount cuts at federal government agencies.\nPresidio Bay is floating a mixed-use development for the site. The campus could accommodate 600 to 1,000 units of housing and 600,000 to 800,000 square feet of commercial space. The city of Menlo Park is required to permit nearly 3,000 new units of housing before 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n.\nPalo Alto offices sell at pre-pandemic price\nThe sale price for a downtown Palo Alto office building is reminiscent of pre-pandemic glory days.\nFirst Citizens Bank &amp; Trust\nbought the offices\nat 250 University Avenue for $82 million. The sale by Inspire Real Estate Holdings works out to $1,969 per square foot. The building spans four stories across 38,000 square feet.\nIn downtown Palo Alto, other office buildings that sold for similar per-square-foot prices before the pandemic include 192 Lytton Avenue for $23.1 million, or $2,551 a square foot; 530 Lytton Avenue for $117.5 million, or $2,156 a square foot; 150 Forest Avenue for $26 million, or $2,153 a square foot; and 385 Sherman Avenue for $138 million, or $2,030 a square foot.\nOffice property sales in Palo Alto in recent years have ranged from lows, like Hudson Pacific Properties\u2019 sale last year of an office campus\n4001-4009 Miranda Avenue\nfor $23 million, or about $126 per square foot, to highs like the 2023 purchase of\n2555 Park Boulevard\nin south Palo Alto for $58 million, or about $2,000 per square foot.\nSantana Row prepares to sell more apartments\nAnother apartment complex at San Jose\u2019s Santana Row is headed for the market.\nFederal Realty Investment Trust is preparing to list the 212-unit Misora luxury apartment complex for sale. It would follow a transaction in May in which Hines bought the 108-unit\nLevare\napartment complex in Santana Row for $73.9 million, or $348,600 per unit.\nMisora was built in 2014 and spans 222,000 square feet. It features\namenities\nlike a lap pool, lounging pool, spa, fireplace lounge, rooftop deck and outdoor barbecue and dining space. If Misora sells for a similar per-unit price as Levare, it would total more than $145 million.\nHousing construction at Santana Row isn\u2019t slowing down. Last month, Federal Realty announced\nplans for a 258-unit apartment complex\nat 358 Hatton Street, making it the first new housing development at Santana Row in a decade.\nPebble Beach manse sets Monterey County record\nA three-story estate in Pebble Beach\nset a record\n.\nThe ocean-view mansion at 1522 Riata Road sold for $18.1 million, or $2,498 per square foot, making it the highest-value transaction in the seaside county so far this year. The home was listed for under $12 million in 2022. It topped out other high-end purchases in the county including a Carmel Highlands estate that sold in June for $14.8 million, a home in Carmel that sold for $15.5 million that same month, and another Carmel estate in April that was bought for $17.5 million.\nBuilt in 1927, the record-setting home sits on a 2.2-acre lot and spans 7,250 square feet with a four-car garage and views of the Pacific Ocean and Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nAs of June, the median listing home price in Pebble Beach was $3.5 million, representing an 8 percent drop year-over-year. The median sale price was $2.8 million with homes spending about 10 weeks on the market.\n",

        "content": "Among the top listings sold in Houston last month, the most expensive home was also the oldest.\nA 1938 mansion at 2110 River Oaks Boulevard was asking $18.9 million when it sold on July 31, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. That\u2019s $11 million more than the second-highest listing, a 2024 build in Piney Point Village. The asking price amounted to $2,004 per square foot. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nLaura Sweeney of Compass represented the buyers, philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade, according to property records. Long is the daughter of Cornelia Long and the late Meredith Long, who was a well-known gallerist. Sweeney also represented the seller, the estate of the late Larry Brookshire.\n\nThe 1.6-acre gated estate includes the 9,400-square-foot main house, remodeled in 2000, and two other dwellings that were built in 2012: a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom guest apartment over the garage, and a 1,000-square-foot \u201centertainment pavilion\u201d by the pool.\nThe house is in the River Oaks Country Club Estate subdivision, anchored by the eponymous golf club founded a little over a century ago. River Oaks frequently takes the top spot for luxury sales in Houston; in May, one street in the River Oaks neighborhood,\nInverness Drive,\naccounted for $23 million in sales. Two of the three\nmost expensive single-family homes for rent\nin Houston in July were in River Oaks. The third most-expensive home in Houston last month was an 8,400-square-foot mid-century modern house at 2411 River Oaks Boulevard, which was asking $7.8 million, or $919 per square foot, when it sold on July 14.\nSweeney also\nsold the most expensive Houston home in March\n, a European-inspired estate at 19 West Lane in Montrose.Residential developments underway in River Oaks include a\nSt. Regis condo project\nat 102 Asbury Street, the brand\u2019s first purely residential development in Texas, and the RO, a Transwestern development that will include an Auberge Resorts Collection hotel.\n",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank hasn\u2019t been happy with billionaire landlord Joel Wiener.\nThe bank has accused Wiener of mismanaging his properties and disputed the expert appraisals of their value. The allegations have shined a light on some of the issues that could be coming to the Israeli bond market, which Wiener tapped for cheap financing.\nFlagstar made the allegations in a bankruptcy case involving Wiener\u2019s 82 property entities, which owe more than $1.1 billion to Flagstar and Israeli bondholders, according to court documents. Together, the companies control 93 New York apartment buildings and more than 5,200 units.\nWiener\u2019s entities want to use rental income to cover their operating expenses. But Flagstar has strenuously objected. The properties haven\u2019t paid their mortgages since January and many are facing foreclosure. The bank said in May it has serious concerns about where money is going, questioning whether Wiener\u2019s role included \u201csimple mismanagement of the debtors\u2019 properties, or worse.\u201d\nAn attorney for Wiener did not offer a comment for this article. Flagstar did not respond to requests for comment.\nFlagstar has also raised alarms about the flow of funds at the businesses. The businesses paid Israeli bondholders $12 million, the bank alleged, while not paying their mortgages.\n\u201cSignificantly flawed and not credible\u201d\nWiener was among the first New York real estate players to tap into the Israeli bond market for financing, raising more than\n$500 million\n. His bankruptcy case has highlighted another player in that market: Michelle Zell, an appraiser for Bowery Valuation.\nZell, who says she\u2019s valued properties for Israeli bond issuances totalling more than $1 billion, is serving as the companies\u2019 expert witness in the bankruptcy case. In the case of the 93 New York buildings in Wiener\u2019s portfolio, she has argued the properties are worth more than their debt.\nFlagstar\u2019s expert cast doubt on Zell\u2019s determinations, calling her report \u201csignificantly flawed and not credible.\u201d Appraiser Scott Fowler of Ankura Real Estate Advisory said her report was based on \u201cunsupported, incorrect or inappropriate data.\u201d\n\nZell\u2019s response was filed under seal, but the judge in the case said she was \u201ca well-qualified valuation expert who presented generally reasonable analyses.\u201d She did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nNew York real estate dealmakers who tapped into the\u00a0 Israeli bond market notably saw several defaults in the last decade.\nBrooklyn developer Yoel Goldman was the subject of a criminal investigation in Israel after his All Year Management unraveled under high leverage, declaring bankruptcy. He reached a settlement with the Israel Securities Authority, but was\nbanned from raising money\nin the country for five years.\nStarwood Capital drew a class action lawsuit from Israeli pensioners for allegedly misleading investors after it defaulted on a $254 million bond. Starwood said the allegations were meritless, but agreed to the appointment of a receiver, according to\nCoStar\n.\nIn a separate unrelated case, Zell is facing direct allegations that she misappraised property. Investment firm Saluda Grade alleged it purchased a $13.7 million loan for a 40-building apartment complex in southeast Texas after Zell and a colleague valued it at $18.4 million. But once the borrower defaulted, Saluda Grade got a second opinion. That review placed the retrospective value at just $5.8 million, a 68 percent difference.\n\u201cThe appraisal was so bad that the appraiser defendants\u2019 agent only inspected one building out of the forty buildings that made up the development being appraised!\u201d the lender wrote in its complaint.\nElsewhere in the bankruptcy case, Flagstar has taken issue with the companies\u2019 effort to pay management fees to other Wiener-controlled businesses. Experts say payroll expenses at the property entities are unusually high at the LLCs, according to court documents.\n\u201cDebtors pay a 4% management fee to an insider even though their own expert assumed that a 3% fee was more typical,\u201d a judge wrote in June.\nIn June, a federal judge denied the Wiener\u2019s companies\u2019 efforts to use rental cash to cover expenses, saying Flagstar\u2019s interests as a secured creditor were not protected. But he urged Flagstar to work something out with the companies on an interim basis, given that the living conditions of thousands of tenants were on the line. The parties have agreed to the use of cash for a period of a few months.\n",

        "content": "Two Brownstone Brooklyn townhouses asking over $10 million scored contracts last week.\nThe first, a 6,500-square-foot home asking $14.5 million, was Park Slope\u2019s most expensive listing at the time it went into contract. It was one of 20 homes that went into contract between Aug. 11 and Aug. 18, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed on homes asking at least $2 million.\nThose homes had a total contract volume of $83 million, up the previous week from $59 million.\nIt first earned the title of priciest listing when it hit the market asking $18 million in May 2024 with Brown Harris Stevens.\nThe sellers, Jeanne and Dennis Masel, cut the price at the start of this year to $17 million before re-listing it with Compass\u2019 Tim Malone at $16.5 million in April and dropping the price again to $14.5 million at the end of May.\nIf it sells for its last asking price, it would still claim Park Slope\u2019s most expensive townhouse sale. That record currently belongs to\n53 Prospect Park West, which sold for $13.5 million\nin December 2023 after initially asking $30 million when it hit the market in 2021.\nThe five-story home at 535 1st Street has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The Masels, who bought the home for nearly $6 million in 2007, undertook a four-year renovation beginning in 2018 with Leroy Street Studio.\nThe garden level features a chef\u2019s kitchen with an 18-foot marble island and a sunken den with a gas fireplace and direct garden access. The parlor level has a living room with a second gas fireplace, an open library with glass walls looking out to the backyard and a private screening room.\n\nThe third floor is dedicated to the primary suite, which has a walk-in dressing room, private terrace and en-suite bathroom. The top floor has more living space with retractable glass walls leading to two terraces.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a Cobble Hill townhouse at 57 Wyckoff Street in an off-market deal. The sale closed for $10.45 million, according to public records.\nThe five-story, 25-foot wide townhouse features five beds, four full bathrooms and spans 6,000 square feet. The home comes with a large back garden and a hot tub on the top floor roof deck, according to a previous listing.\nThe home previously sold for $9.4 million in 2022, after originally hitting the market asking $14 million in 2021.\nSerhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha and Cameron LeCates had the listing. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Aran Scott brought the buyer.\nThere were eight contracts signed for condos and 12 for houses last week, which had a combined median asking price of $3 million and average price per square foot of $1,494.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Brooklyn is on track for a record-breaking year in housing development.\nAccording to a new report from the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership\u2019s real estate team, the neighborhood is slated for its highest number of new units yet,\nCrain\u2019s New York Business\nreported.\nDuring the first six months of the year, Downtown Brooklyn saw more than 3,700 units completed, with another 1,183 set to be finished before the end of 2025. This breaks the area\u2019s previous record of 2,925 units completed in 2022.\nOf those units, 3,334 were finished between April and the end of June, with 1,048 designated as affordable. Those units make up 12 percent of the 26,853 units built since the neighborhood was rezoned in 2004 to spur office construction, expand academic facilities and add residential and retail projects.\n\u201cThis is the constant evolution of Downtown Brooklyn,\u201d Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, told the publication. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible trajectory.\u201d\nThis evolution will likely stay on an upward trajectory, Myer said. The recent passage of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 rezoning initiative, is expected to add 82,000 new housing units to the city over the next 15 years.\n\nIn fact, a\nTRD analysis\nof new building permits filed with the New York City Department of Buildings between June 2024 and 2025 found that Downtown Brooklyn tops the city for new units in the pipeline.\nThe report outlines 12 projects set to begin construction, bringing 2,246 housing units \u2014 437 of them affordable \u2014 along with 73,100 square feet of retail. Another 25 projects are in the works for the coming year and beyond, adding at least 4,412 more housing units, including 1,098 affordable.\nAmong those projects is the recently announced rezoning of\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\n, which would pave the way for a 1.5-million-square-foot residential tower with 1,263 apartments; 253 to 379 of them will be affordable.\nWhile housing in the neighborhood is going strong, a recent report found that office leasing volume is\nflagging\nas the demand for office space is still catching up to the oversupply built in the last 20 years.\n\u2013 Quinn Waller\n",

        "content": "Onni Group is tweaking its plans for an office development in Hollywood to include housing.\nThe Vancouver-based firm is looking to add a new 14-story building to the historic Howard Hughes Headquarters Building site at 7000 West Romaine Street, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The new structure would feature 195,000 square feet of offices, 6,393 square feet of ground-floor retail and an 809-car garage next door.\nConstruction was set to begin as early as this year but the developer has yet to complete the entitlement process. City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez introduced a motion to begin a general plan amendment and zone change for the site that would allow high-rise housing units in at least a portion of the proposed office space.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be Onni Group\u2019s first rodeo trying to turn an office-dominant project into a partial residential development.\nIn April, the firm filed plans to build an all-residential tower complex in the Arts District in place of a project that previously included nearly 200,000 square feet of offices. In 2023, it sought a\nsimilar conversion in Glendale\nto turn a proposed hotel project into housing.\n\nElsewhere in downtown,\nJamison Properties\nis preparing to begin the redevelopment of the nearly 610,000-square-foot L.A. Care building at 1055 West 7th Street into 691 luxury residences.\nOnni Group\u2019s new development comes as the Los Angeles office market faces an uphill battle toward recovery post-pandemic. Office vacancy in the Greater L.A. area ticked up to 24.4 percent last quarter, according to\nColliers\n\u2019 Q2 report.\nEarlier this year, the Los Angeles City Council aimed to boost office-to-residential conversions in the city by\noverhauling zoning and adaptive reuse regulations\nand providing incentives for developers to create 43,000 new housing units.\nAcross the country, office-to-residential conversions have never been more popular. As of this year, there are nearly 71,000 units set to be redeveloped from offices, according to\nRentCafe\n. It\u2019s a new record and represents a tripling of the number of units in the works three years ago. Office-to-residential plans nationwide make up 42 percent of future conversion projects, up from 38 percent last year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago is about to lose one of its quirkiest cultural gems.\nThe Klairmont Kollections Automotive Museum, a two-story trove of nearly 300 vintage cars stashed in a half-mile-long warehouse in Belmont Cragin, will close next month, and hundreds of vehicles and thousands of memorabilia pieces headed to the auction block.\nThe late Larry Klairmont, founder of Imperial Realty and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in World War II, spent decades amassing the fleet, starting with a 1951 Rolls-Royce in the 1960s, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. His buying ramped up over the years to a point where he was \u201cbuying cars by the dozens,\u201d his son Alfred Klairmont, CEO of Imperial Realty, told the outlet.\nBy the time Klairmont died in 2021, the collection had morphed into a private museum that opened to the public in 2019, showcasing everything from a gold-leaf Pierce Arrow to a crystal-encrusted Rolls-Royce, plus a replica Batmobile and even a Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.\n\nMecum Auctions \u2014 known for selling the Porsche 917K Steve McQueen drove in the 1971 film\nLe Mans\nfor $25 million and the Mustang McQueen drove in the 1968 film\nBullitt\nfor $3.74 million \u2014 is set to handle the sale Sept. 19 to 21. The no-reserve auction will feature 275 vehicles and more than 1,000 pieces of road art, with previews earlier that week. Dubbed \u201cLarry\u2019s Legacy Auction,\u201d highlights include the Golden Sahara II, a 1956 futuristic prototype with glowing Goodyear tires, and a 1926 Rickenbacker Eight Super Sport believed to be the last of its kind.\nFor years, the museum was hidden in plain sight inside an unassuming brick industrial building at 3117 North Knox Avenue in\nBelmont Cragin\n. Visitors stepping inside were met with aisles of pristine Cadillacs, Corvettes, Lamborghinis and race cars, plus neon signs, full size replica model planes and a Ronald McDonald statue.\nWhile bidders worldwide will now get a chance to take home a slice of Klairmont\u2019s eccentric empire, the auction also marks the end of a real estate play that turned a forgotten warehouse into a Chicago oddity. Proceeds will go toward a foundation in Klairmont\u2019s name, funding youth education programs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A foreclosure auction for the mall has been delayed a half-dozen times, with the most recent date scheduled next week on Aug. 21.\nThe mall has seen a steep drop in foot traffic as fewer stores bring in fewer customers. Between 2019 and 2024, foot traffic at San Francisco Centre fell 63.3 percent, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. From January to May of this year, foot traffic at the mall was down 68 percent from the same period in 2019 and between 25 and 40 percent in the same span the year prior.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal breaks down to nearly $364,000 per unit.\nThe garden-style complex, previously called Solaire at Coconut Creek, was renamed Avalon Coconut Creek after the purchase.\nCompleted in 2013, Avalon Coconut Creek consists of 12 three-story apartment buildings, a club, gym and pool on a 15.2-acre site, Vizzda records show.

The site is adjacent to the Publix-anchored shopping plaza at 374 Northlake Boulevard.\nSouth Florida\nmultifamily investment sales\nhave experienced a slight increase in recent months.

        "content": "An empty lot near Beverly Hills is headed for redevelopment after selling for eight figures.\nSherman Oaks-based multifamily developer BW Brody Affiliated Companies paid an individual investor $24.3 million for 9700-9740 West Pico Boulevard, currently a 1.7-acre patch of grass,\nCoStar\nreported. The firm plans to develop a luxury apartment complex at the site, in Pico-Robertson just outside the Beverly Hills city limits.\nSelling for $13.9 million per acre, the sale marks one of the most-expensive lot sales in Los Angeles in years among deals for parcels greater than 1 acre, the outlet said. It\u2019s slightly higher than a similar sale last year where two Hollywood parking lots, previously slated for a multifamily development that stalled, sold for $13 million per acre. In June, CGI+ Real Estate Investment Strategies sold a 4.9-acre site in Torrance for $40 million, or about $8 million per acre.\nThe West Pico Boulevard site was once home to an office building and is located near retail, dining and offices in Century City and Beverly Hills.\nBW Brody Affiliated manages luxury apartments across the Los Angeles area, including the 113-unit Metro Art Sherman Oaks at 14140 Moorpark Street, and the 62-unit Metro Art Brentwood at 11771 Montana Avenue. The firm is expected to seek entitlements for multifamily.\n\nApartment\ndevelopment across the city is down 20 percent, and most projects are rising in downtown, Koreatown and east side neighborhoods, leaving the west side in the dust when it comes to construction. There are only six large apartment projects under construction in Los Angeles, according to CoStar.\nHousing construction and proposals on the Westside haven\u2019t ground to a complete halt, however. In West Los Angeles, Southern California Affordable Housing is planning to redevelop an abandoned commercial building in West Los Angeles into 279 affordable studio and one-bedroom apartments.\nApartment vacancy across Los Angeles is about 5 percent. It remains to be seen whether BW Brody Affiliated can pull off a luxury development amid high construction costs and a lengthy entitlement process that usually favors affordable housing projects.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s latest move to fund its $1.7 billion Chicago casino in River West added 1,800 investors to its real estate gamble, falling short of its $250 million stock sales target, but more offerings are on the horizon.\nThe company raised $31 million this week through a stock offering tied to its Host Community Agreement with the city, which required that 25 percent of the casino be minority-owned, according to an SEC filing. The sale brought in $5.5 million from small investors and another $25.6 million from private buyers, with shares priced between $250 and $25,000, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Bally\u2019s Chairman\nSoo Kim\ncast it as the first in a series of sales, after raising just 12.4 percent of the goal. The value of the IPO is $96.7 million, including Class A investments, private placement and Bally\u2019s funding to support individual investors, according to the filing.\nthe ownership push for redeveloping the 30-acre former Chicago Tribune printing plant site at 700 West Chicago Avenue is just one piece of a far larger financing puzzle for Bally\u2019s. The company has already locked down $940 million in debt, which is funding demolition and foundation work at the former Tribune Publishing site along the Chicago River, where the permanent casino and resort are scheduled to open in about a year. The balance of the project cost will be covered through a mix of equity sales and additional financing.\nThe offering\u2019s shortfall raises the risk of noncompliance with the Host Community Agreement, which could trigger penalties or even jeopardize the city\u2019s approval, Bally\u2019s warned. The project is secure as long as debt and construction financing continue flowing. Unlike the stock offering, the debt facility is critical to keeping the build-out on schedule.\n\nThe equity sale also highlights a broader tension in casino development: pairing community ownership promises with the realities of large-scale financing. While 1,800 small investors bought into the $250 tier, most of the heavy lifting came from big checks in the private placement. Critics said the approach risks turning a political win into a symbolic gesture, while the real estate project powering ahead will ultimately depend more on lenders than local shareholders.\nBally\u2019s Chicago refiled and expanded the IPO in April, eliminating the minority requirements in the IPO after two lawsuits from two white men\nalleging discrimination\nin the investment opportunity were settled in Chicago federal court. Loop Capital Markets, a Chicago-based placement agent, headed up the IPO offering. Bally\u2019s has operated a temporary casino at the Medinah Temple since late 2023.\nThe\nconstruction\ntimeline on the casino, which includes a 500-room hotel, 10 restaurants, 4,000 gaming positions and an exhibition space, is set for an opening date by September 2026, but recent construction delays could affect that goal.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

He declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity. The deed has yet to be recorded.\nNicole Chambless with United Realty Group brought the buyer.\nAlter was at one point CEO of one of Philadelphia\u2019s largest companies, before Advanta filed for bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis. His father started the firm as TSO Financial in 1951, specializing in loans to teachers in Pennsylvania, Florida and Delaware, according to published reports. After the younger Alter took the helm in 1971, he steered the business toward credit cards, transforming it into a multibillion-dollar business.\nFollowing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued Alter and other Advanta executives for $219 million in 2013, according to published reports. They settled for a combined $23.5 million in 2016, the\nTemple News\nreported.\n\nProperty records do not show when or for how much Alter bought the 1-acre Hillsboro Mile estate, which runs from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway. He owned the property for more than 40 years, according to a press release.\nThe 10,400-square-foot house was built in 2009, records show. It has eight bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, 147 feet of water frontage, a pool and a sport court, according to the listing. It was designed by John Saladino, a renowned interior designer who died last month, the\nNew York Times\nreported.\nAlter listed it for $28 million in January, Zillow shows. Liguori said the estate appealed to the buyer because it is in a no-wake zone along the Intracoastal Waterway, and has capacity for a dock that can fit both of his yachts.\nIt marks the latest pricey sale in\nHillsboro Beach\n, an area Liguori describes as \u201cin transition.\u201d\n\u201cTeardowns are being turned into these $40 [million], $50 [million], $60 million dollar properties,\u201d he said.\nRecent sales include AutoNation CEO Mike Manley\u2019s\n$14.5 million\npurchase of an oceanfront mansion in April.\nRelated Group\nand Dezer Development are also planning luxury condos in the town.

        "content": "More than 20,000 new apartments in San Francisco have yet to see the light of day after receiving approval for construction.\nWhile housing prices have increased in the city, construction of new residential projects have stalled as developers weigh the costs of inflation, additional city fees, a shortage of construction materials and ongoing federal tariffs, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nRents in the city were up 10.6 percent last month year-over-year, per Apartment List data cited by the Chronicle. Home prices are up too with 5.2 percent last month from last July with a median price of $1.7 million.\nAs demand increases, supply has been slow to increase. Only 1,453 homes in new buildings, excluding renovations and additions, were completed last year \u2014 less than a third of the more than 5,000 new homes completed in 2020\n.\nPlans for just 2,541 new homes were filed last year. As it stands, the city lags behind its state-mandated\nHousing Element\ngoal of permitting 82,000 units by 2031.\nWhile some megaprojects completed hundreds of new housing units during the pandemic, such as Treasure Island, Mission Rock and 5M, other projects across the city have been slow to get off the ground.\n\nAt the Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point site, for example, more than 10,000 homes were approved for construction in 2010. But environmental hazards at the shipyard including nuclear toxins and radium-filled paint have presented a major hurdle, leading developer FivePoint Holdings to instead focus on the Candlestick project, though that one has also been stuck in delays as well.\nParkmerced, the largest apartment complex in the city, was set to receive 5,600 new units in 2011, but its construction start was repeatedly delayed before the pandemic paused it entirely. Maximus Real Estate Partners defaulted on its mortgage and surrendered the 3,221-unit property earlier this year;\nnew receiver Douglas Wilson Companies\nis focused on maintenance issues rather than new units.\nIn South of Market, the Creamery closed in 2020 to make way for a\nBjarke Ingels\n-designed mixed-use project, though the Danish visionary is no longer involved. The plan was revised to include 1,110 units and was approved in 2023, but it, like all the major projects\nplanned in the Central SoMa area,\nhas yet to start construction in the face of high construction costs and weaker office demand for office space.\nNearby, other projects like the new\nSan Francisco Flower Mart\nand\n88 Bluxome\nhave sought plan revisions that could include more focus on housing.\nOceanwide Center, meanwhile, broke ground in SoMa in 2016 but was paused in 2019 and later sued by construction firms claiming they were never paid. It\u2019s just a hole in the ground today, according to the Chronicle \u2014 not unlike Oceanwide\u2019s abandoned, graffiti-filled skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A property tax hike is headed to the ballot after Austin officials signed off on a $6.3 billion city budget for the upcoming fiscal year that leans on property owners to fill widening fiscal gaps.\nThe Austin City Council approved raising the tax rate from $0.4776 to $0.574017 per $100 in property value, a more than 20 percent hike that requires voter approval under Texas law. If passed in the Nov. 4 election, the median homeowner would pay nearly $420 more next year, including about $300 in added taxes, Community Impact\nreported\n. A failed vote would drop the rate to the maximum allowed without triggering an election, cutting the proposed increase almost in half.\n\u201cIt is time for us to trust our voters,\u201d Mayor Kirk\nWatson\nsaid after the council vote last week.\nThe decision followed a summer of bruising debate over how to fund homelessness programs, housing aid, parks, public health, safety and other services as federal pandemic dollars dry up and property tax caps tighten city revenues.\nCity leaders tapped reserves and housing funds to balance the coming fiscal year, but most agreed Austin needs more stable revenue. The approved framework puts millions toward homelessness response and social services while preserving emergency reserves above 17 percent of the general fund, a key goal as officials warn of deeper deficits later this decade.\n\nVoters statewide have shown mixed appetite for tax elections since the state capped tax hikes in 2020. Austin\u2019s own 2020 transit tax increase passed with 58 percent support, and recent hikes in Austin-San Antonio corridor suburbs also cleared the bar. Still, residents this summer were split: some argued the city can\u2019t keep up essential services without the hike, while others balked at rising costs in an already expensive\nhousing market\n.\nThe stakes are high. A failed tax referendum won\u2019t automatically revert the city to its base budget; instead, council must reconvene and potentially cut baseline items and add-ons tied to the hike.\nAffordable housing\n, emergency response, social services and parks could all take a hit.\nThe vote also comes as Travis County moved its tax rate above the voter-approval threshold to cover emergency expenses in response to the devastating July floods. That rate increase did not require voter approval and will be lowered next year, but could frame the outcome of the city tax vote.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

San Jose was the first large city in the state to adopt the law last July.\n\u201cADUs are affordable by design and growing in popularity across the state, and now they can offer the most accessible form of home ownership too,\u201d Mayor Matt Mahan said in a\nstatement\n, saying the city\u2019s ADU condo sale approval is a \u201cproof of concept for California.\u201d\n\nThe unit, located on Jos\u00e9fa Street near downtown, was developed by Bay Area real estate firm AlphaX RE Capital. It plans to build dozens more hoping to pursue similar moves, saying it can \u201coffer homeownership at more attainable price points, giving families the opportunity to build equity and long-term stability,\u201d AlphaX founder and CEO Stephanie Yi said.\nSan Jose has permitted 1,500 ADUs since 2022 and issued final building permits for more than 1,110, according to the Chronicle. Other Bay Area cities like Berkeley and San Francisco are considering similar measures to help confront the housing crisis.\nHomeowners in California and across the country looking to build ADUs could stand to benefit from a new bill proposed in Congress by former San Jose mayor and current congressman Sam Liccardo.\nLast month, Liccardo\nproposed\nthe Supporting Upgraded Property Projects and Lending for Yards (SUPPLY) Act, which would provide government-backed, flexible financing options to help homeowners overcome ADU construction costs. The act would direct the Federal Housing Administration to provide government backing for second mortgages to finance ADU construction and would permit\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nto purchase and securitize those loans.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Todd Wallace, one of Austin\u2019s most influential real estate figures, died in late July after a six-year battle with cancer. He was 53.\nWallace was president of JLL\u2019s Central Texas region and CEO of CSW Development. At JLL, he transformed the firm\u2019s Austin and San Antonio\noffices\ninto a 150-person operation, cementing its place as one of the market\u2019s dominant brokerages, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\u00a0 At CSW, he guided a slate of shopping centers, industrial complexes and mixed-use projects that helped reshape the metro\u2019s commercial footprint.\nWallace\nbegan his career with stints at the Weitzman Group and SRS Real Estate Partners. He joined JLL in 2013 as a senior managing director and was promoted to president in 2022. His brokerage chops were formidable: in 2015, he leased more retail space than any other broker in Austin, with over 267,000 square feet.\nJLL\u2019s Will Douglas and Russell Young will co-lead the office on an interim basis.\n\u201cHe always put his people first, lifting careers through his belief in us, his guidance, and the opportunities he opened,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cTodd\u2019s influence is the foundation on which our team operates, and we are honored to carry it forward.\u201d\n\nColleagues and peers remembered him as a market force and a mentor.\nCSW\nco-president Robert O\u2019Farrell, Wallace\u2019s business partner, said his greatest legacy was his generosity.\nBeyond his deals and leadership, Wallace was known for keeping family and faith at the center of his life. Colleagues noted he often spoke about them first, even in the boardroom.\nFor Austin\u2019s real estate community, Wallace\u2019s death leaves a void not just in the market\u2019s power structure, but in the personal networks he built over decades. His imprint, they said, will endure in the teams he grew and the city he helped shape.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Former Silverstein Properties CEO Marty Burger and a European investment firm Revetas will oversee the management of a $4 billion real estate portfolio with stakes in Michael Shvo\u2019s firm\u2019s trophy properties.\nRevetas was mandated to take over the management of Deutsche Finance America, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nDeutsche Finance America (DFA) acted as the U.S. arm of Munich-based investment manager Deutsche Finance Group. DFA invested in many of Shvo\u2019s most prominent assets, such as the Coca-Cola building in Manhattan, the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach and the Transamerica tower in San Francisco. The company also partnered in deals unrelated to Shvo, including a 1 million-square-foot life sciences development outside of Boston.\nRevetas tapped Burger, who now runs his own firm, Infinite Global Real Estate Partners, as its U.S. point person. Green Street was the first to report the news.\nIn its press release, Revetas describes its intention as supporting the repositioning of the German firm\u2019s U.S. portfolio. This will include \u201crepricing by pursuing the most suitable path for each asset \u2013 including repositionings, selective dispositions, refinancings and capital restructurings \u2013 while maintaining continuity for tenants, lenders and partners.\u201d\nRevetas and Burger will replace the job of Jason Lucas, Deutsche Finance America\u2019s founding partner and former CEO.\nLucas recently left the company, and there is now an ongoing dispute between him and Munich-based DFG. Lucas, who retains a minority stake in DFA, has hired counsel to pursue legal action, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nLucas declined to comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Shvo said there would be no impact on management of its assets.\nBurger and Revetas\u2019 role at DFA will come down to the rights provided in DFA\u2019s operating agreement with Shvo. This agreement will dictate whether DFA has the ability to force Shvo to sell or restructure properties. It\u2019s possible DFA does not have many rights, as limited partners often do not, making the new hires\u2019 jobs essentially toothless.\n\u201cRevetas has been mandated as an independent fiduciary to maximize value for all investors in the portfolio. The portfolio contains outstanding, high-quality real estate,\u201d said Eric Assimakopoulos, founding partner of Revetas Group. \u201cBy combining the investors\u2019 deep platform knowledge with Revetas\u2019 deep value and operational toolkit, we are confident we can optimize value for existing stakeholders through the most appropriate solution for each property.\u201d\nTo be sure, the German investors\u2019 foray into U.S. real estate has not gone as planned. DFA was founded in 2018 to manage deals on behalf of investors in Munich-based DFG.\nThat year, a host of German investors, including the pension fund BVK, put money into Shvo\u2019s luxury real estate projects. But Covid-19 and higher interest rates hit nearly all U.S. office assets \u2014 and Shvo\u2019s properties were no exception.\nShvo\u2019s signature project in Miami, The Raleigh, for example, has stalled. New York-based Nahla Capital won a bid to purchase the property for about\n$275 million\n. Shvo has the right of first refusal and is trying to match the offer, Business Insider reported last month. Shvo and his partners\npaid a combined $243 million\nfor the property in 2019.\nShvo is separately in the midst of a dispute with BVK. Shvo has filed a claim through the private Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, alleging the firm is owed more than $85 million in fees, including $27 million in payments tied to specific properties and $21 million in carried interest from the Transamerica Pyramid project in San Francisco,\nBisnow reported\n.\nBVK said in a statement it is \u201cnot unusual to seek a separation, possibly prematurely, depending on the performance of an investment, the overall market or the existing interest of third parties.\u201d\n",

Part of the site will be used to develop the Wingrove campus, and part will be used for a planned mixed-use development by Related Ross. The developer is planning a restaurant and retail district with a 180-key hotel and 500 residential units, similar to its\nCityPlace\ndistrict in West Palm Beach.\nDemand for private schools has surged in South Florida in recent years, fueled by the post-pandemic wealth migration to the region.\nEnrollment is at record highs\n, and acceptance rates are at all-time lows, school leaders say.\nRoss has been on a mission to meet the unmet demand for private schooling, which real estate insiders say is key to luring top financiers to the offices he is building in West Palm Beach.

The plan lays out how the Silicon Valley enclave plans to accommodate 4,588 new homes by 2031 as mandated by the state.\nThe builder\u2019s remedy allowed developers to override local zoning laws with their projects.\nBut Cupertino officials deemed their applications expired by the time it had a certified housing element in place, preventing the developers from resubmitting the same proposals.\n\nThe city, citing the Permit Streamlining Act, argued that developers only have one 90-day window to respond to the city\u2019s questions about its application, regardless of how many times the city returns with more inquiries about the proposal.\nThe Department of Housing and Community Development said in its letter that \u201cthe 90-day deadline resets after each incompleteness determination made by the city,\u201d confirming that \u201ca project with multiple incompleteness determination letters and responses may have multiple 90-day periods.\u201d\nYIMBY Law and the California Housing Defense Fund filed a joint lawsuit in the spring seeking a resolution to the issue. The legal case is ongoing.\nCupertino isn\u2019t the only city to interpret the law to only call for one 90-day incomplete period. In March,\nLos Gatos filed a lawsuit\nin Santa Clara County Superior Court asking for clarification on the 90-day window provision.

        "content": "Xin Capital has nabbed a $51 million loan to acquire a fully-leased retail and office assemblage in Times Square.\nWhite Oak Real Estate Capital provided the senior secured loan for the purchase of Times Square West, a 144,500-square-foot property at 303 West 42nd Street and 300 West 43rd Street. The complex includes 17,500 square feet of ground-floor retail and 127,000 square feet of recently renovated office space.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in an extremely strong market, Times Square still being one of the most prominent retail corridors in the country,\u201d said Eric Tanjeloff, Managing Principal at White Oak Real Estate Capital.\nThe financing will bridge Xin Capital through a rent-free buildout period for its newly signed master tenant in the office portion, which will upgrade the space into a yet-to-be-announced global food and beverage entertainment experience. Tanjeloff predicts that when the plans for the space become public, it \u201cwill garner some attention because it is so different\u201d from what currently exists in the city.\nThat lease will bring the property to 100 percent occupancy. \u201cWe think that creates significant value for the owner and obviously support for our loan,\u201d said Tanjeloff.\nCurrent retail tenants include Chick-fil-A, Smashburger, 7-Eleven, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Little Italy Pizza, predominantly under long-term leases signed during the pandemic at below-market rent, according to Tanjeloff. Those leases have about 15 years remaining, providing what he called a \u201cstable foundation\u201d for the property\u2019s cash flow.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with WOREC\u2019s execution on this financing which allowed us to take\nadvantage of what we believe is a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy undervalued assets in\nManhattan,\u201d said Jerry Tang, Founder of Xin Capital, in a statement.\nThe project is an example of how Manhattan\u2019s\nvacant office space\ncan be creatively\nreimagined\nfor more viable uses, Tanjeloff said, citing a past $21.5 million White Oak financing of a conversion to self-storage in Tribeca, hotel conversions and other non-office uses.\nThe deal comes on the heels of White Oaks\u2019 recent $42.2 million senior secured loan to Related Companies for the Village at Tuxedo Reserve and a $27.2 million senior secured loan to 1784 Holdings for a self-storage project in Garden Grove, California.\n",

        "content": "Two buyers snapped up an 8-acre property with housing, a gas station and a karate studio in Santa Ana.\nThe 210 apartment units and karate studio sold to an unnamed Newport Beach investor, while another bought the gas station, the Orange County Register\nreported\n. The properties sold for a combined $43 million.\nChris Keramati, Justin Schneider and Gustavo Fimbres of Newport Beach-based Triqor Group brokered the transaction, representing a family trust that owned the property, which has a ground lease dating back to 1965. That ground lease was set to expire in May, prompting the family trust to list the property for sale late last year after fielding offers from several potential buyers.\nThe addresses are 1221 Beechwood Street, 2320-2340 North Grand Avenue and 1220 East Santa Clara Avenue. The buyer of the apartments plans to invest in upgrades, Triqor told the outlet.\nThe 60-year-old property sits on a site that was once an orange grove. A family bought the site in 1965 and chose to sign a ground lease with a developer who built the apartments.\n\nOther multifamily properties have traded hands elsewhere in Orange County in recent months.\nIn June, San Diego-based\nMG Properties\npaid $144 million, or $458,600 per unit, for Citron, a 314-unit residential complex at 901 East South Street in Anaheim. The four-story buildings were developed in 2023 by Anton DevCo and feature one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments as well as 32,000 square feet of courtyard space, a theater lawn, pool, spa and an indoor and outdoor fitness center.\nLast month, a 22-unit apartment property in Costa Mesa sold for nearly $9.6 million, or $434,845 per unit. The buyer of the property, at 313 and 325 East 17th Place, was reportedly an unidentified investor in Fountain Valley; the seller was also not named. The sale marked the first time in 25 years that the property traded hands, the outlet said. That two-story garden-style complex includes six one-bedroom units and 16 two-bedroom units across two parcels spanning 18,400 square feet, as well as eight single-car garages and 10 surface parking spaces.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A student housing syndicator is at risk of losing two Chicago buildings, while battling a lender that\u2019s closing in on a separate portfolio of similar properties across the U.S.\nVersity Investments, led by Brian Nelson, has been delinquent on loan payments for The Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts in Chicago for the past two months, according to loan servicer notes compiled by commercial mortgage-backed securities tracker Morningstar Credit.\nVersity bought The Buckingham, a 1920s-era high-rise near Roosevelt University, in 2018 for $73.3 million. The firm funded the purchase with a $45.3 million loan originated by Wells Fargo.\nThe 440-unit tower first ran into trouble in late 2020 when Wells hit Versity with a foreclosure lawsuit, alleging the loan was in default. But within a year, the lender worked out a forbearance agreement with Versity instead of taking back the keys.\nSoon after, Versity hired Newmark to market the property at 59 East Van Buren Street in hopes of cutting its losses. However, the building didn\u2019t sell and Versity failed to make mortgage payments toward the loan in both July and August of this year, according to notes from the PNC Bank-owned loan servicer Midland that were compiled by Morningstar.\nThe payments stopped coming in shortly after Versity settled a contract dispute with a private security company that ended with Versity forking over about $40,000, public records show.\n\nAt the same time, Versity fell behind on payments toward a $38 million loan backed by the Tailor Lofts near The University of Illinois at Chicago. Versity bought the 135-unit student apartment building at 315 South Peoria Street in 2019 for $60 million.\nRepresentatives of Versity did not respond to requests for comment.\nThere\u2019s still time for Versity to forge another comeback, because the loans for the Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts don\u2019t mature until 2028 and 2029, respectively. But they\u2019re not the only properties giving the California-based investment company trouble.\nA year before Versity hashed out a settlement with the private security company at The Buckingham, it was slapped with a much bigger lawsuit. A venture of Knighthead Capital Management\u2019s real estate lending arm is suing Versity in a New York court for breach of contract and fraud, among other claims.\nThe filing claims that the Knighthead venture issued loans to Versity to purchase eight student housing complexes across the U.S. but Versity failed to pay off four of them. The four properties with loans in default are located in Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida.\nMuch of the filing is redacted but a separate attorney who is pursuing a mass arbitration claim against Versity on behalf of investors claims Knighthead\u2019s litigation unearthed $56 million in misappropriated proceeds from syndicators.\nNelson\u2019s brother and former business partner is also in hot water for similar reasons. The brothers founded Nelson Brothers Real Estate in 2007 but soon went their separate ways. Brian Nelson\u2019s brother\u2019s firm, Nelson Partners, was the subject of a 2021 New York Times report alleging it ripped off investors and failed to properly maintain its properties.",

        "content": "The only completed building at the long-stalled Lincoln Yards megadevelopment is up for sale, underscoring the site\u2019s fractured future as a cast of players steps in with residential plans.\nSterling Bay, along with partners Harrison Street and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has tapped Eastdil Secured and Savills to market the 284,000-square-foot building at 1229 West Concord Place, CoStar\nreported\n. The eight-story Gensler-designed property was delivered more than two years ago with high-end lab and office space, but it\u2019s entirely vacant.\nThe lender that funded the building, Bank OZK, confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat a loan on the building has a balance of $64.7 million and is in good standing with no write downs. That loan reaches maturity next month.\nThe move marks another twist in the saga of\nLincoln Yards\n, the $6 billion vision Sterling Bay unveiled more than six years ago for 50-plus acres along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The city signed off on zoning that would allow 14.5 million square feet of development and towers topping 500 feet, but little has materialized beyond 1229 West Concord Place. The pandemic, spiking construction and borrowing costs, and heavy infrastructure obligations left the project stalled.\n\nNow, the land is effectively being\nsplit\n. JDL Development and Florida-based Kayne Anderson have agreed to acquire the northern 31 acres from Bank OZK, which seized the site from Sterling Bay\u2019s partner Lone Star Funds. JDL and Kayne are rebranding their portion as Foundry Park, with plans for as many as 3,000 homes spanning single-family, condos and rentals. Meanwhile, the southern portion\u2019s future is murkier, with the Concord building hitting the market and Sterling Bay separately shopping land nearby, including a Kingsbury Street parcel entitled for a\n355-unit\napartment project.\nBrokers are pitching the Concord property as a discount buy relative to replacement cost, with a mix of lab infrastructure and \u201chospitality-caliber\u201d amenities such as a fitness center, outdoor terrace, and riverfront patio. While designed for life sciences, they argue it could easily serve as high-end office space at a time when brand-new inventory is scarce.\nWhether that sales pitch resonates remains to be seen. The building today overlooks empty land, though nearby restaurants, bars and retail are expected once JDL\u2019s residential buildout begins. For now, it stands as a glassy reminder of Sterling Bay\u2019s stalled ambitions \u2014 and a test of whether buyers see value in a trophy building without a neighborhood around it.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s East Side is set for another injection of density, with a $91 million affordable housing project on deck.\nThe Annex Group and local housing authority Opportunity Home plan to build a 279-unit complex dubbed Central at Commerce at 1231 East Commerce Street, less than a block east of St. Paul Square and downtown, and within walking distance of the Amtrak Station and the Alamodome. Construction is slated to kick off in February, with completion by the end of 2027, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The development cost works out to $326,000 per unit.\nThe project will offer one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments with about half of units reserved for tenants earning 70 percent or less of the area median income; 24 percent will be reserved for tenants earning 60 percent AMI; 15 percent will be reserved for tenants earning 30 percent AMI; and 11 percent will be reserved for those earning 50 percent or less of the AMI.\nTo finance the deal, Opportunity Home is pursuing low-income housing tax credits from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, with a decision expected in December. The developers are seeking $41 million in tax credits spread over a decade.\n\nOpportunity Home\u2019s board has already authorized the agency to negotiate a memorandum of understanding to become a general partner in the venture, though final terms are still pending. On the city\u2019s side, council has approved $6 million in gap funding from the 2022 affordable housing bond and is expected to sign off on a resolution of no objection for the tax credit application, a procedural step that keeps the financing moving.\nThe project comes as Opportunity Home is\nexpanding\nthrough multiple partnerships. Just north of the proposed East Commerce site, it recently teamed with\nLynd Living\non The Josephine, which is now in lease-up. Central at Commerce would add hundreds more affordable units in a submarket where\nrising land\nand construction costs have strained developers\u2019 ability to deliver income-restricted housing.\nFor the East Side, the plan underscores how long-discussed development momentum is finally materializing, with city-backed affordable housing playing a central role. If the tax credits land as expected, Central at Commerce could become one of the largest affordable multifamily projects in the area in years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-08-19T09:35:00",
        "content": "The math around the Midtown South rezoning is confusing.\nSpecifically, the adjustments that the City Council made ahead of approving the rezoning underscore just how slippery the housing projections that accompany major zoning changes can be. Were 141 potential housing units lost? Closer to 500? Or 1,000?\nAs part of the environmental review process, the Department of City Planning identifies development sites that are likely to be redeveloped if zoning changes are made, based on a number of factors. That doesn\u2019t mean the agency has received confirmation from the owners of these sites that they will actually take advantage of the rezoning.\nBy the same token, some sites where the owners are keen to redevelop aren\u2019t necessarily included in those projections.\nConsider Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue, a 21-story, vacant office building that was being marketed as a potentially ideal office-to-residential conversion, thanks to the rezoning. The property was part of an area the City Council excluded from a new residential district mapped in the northwest quadrant of the rezoning.\nPer City Council: The rezoning would pave the way for 9,535 housing units. That\u2019s 141 fewer units than the previously projected 9,676 units.\nCity Planning came up with slightly different numbers: In a technical memo detailing the City Council\u2019s modifications to the rezoning, the agency indicated that 193 apartments would be lost as a result of the Council\u2019s changes.\nIt is not clear why these calculations are different.\nThe Council\u2019s carveout in the northwest quadrant did not include any of the 61 \u201cprojected development sites\u201d City Planning predicted would take advantage of the rezoning. It did, however, include one \u201cpotential\u201d site at 240 West 37th Street, where City Planning initially estimated 293 apartments could be built.\nYet, City Planning pegged the projected loss of apartments, due to the City Council\u2019s change in this quadrant, at 76 units.\nPotential sites are considered less likely to be developed in the 10 years following the rezoning (for a number of reasons, such as odd lot shape, tons of commercial tenants or because the lot has already been built out significantly).\nThe unit projections of the seven potential sites were not included in the initial housing estimates released by the city, so it would be weird to say 293 housing units were lost in this area. A City Planning spokesperson said the the 76 units referred to apartments that would have been converted from office space, in addition to the projected sites.\nAnother 117 projected housing units were shaved off the 9,676 units previously estimated because the City Council reduced the maximum residential floor area ratio from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area. I actually checked the four sites affected by this (based on previous unit estimates and lot sizes), and got the same result.\n\nBut that, again, is just on the sites City Planning previously identified as likely candidates for redevelopment.\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, believes these estimates lowball the potential housing lost thanks to the City Council\u2019s modifications. She told\nTRD\nfellow Quinn Waller that she believes the number to be closer to 1,000 units of housing that will not be built across the nearly 40 properties carved out by the City Council (that, of course, assumes those owners would opt to take advantage of the rezoning or sell their properties to someone who would).\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many properties within the carveout areas would have flipped to residential, if ultimately given the chance.\nWe will, however, be able to see how many of the 9,535 apartments in the neighborhood ultimately get built over the next decade. Keep an eye out for more coverage from us on the rezoning.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related books are you reading? Send recommendations to kathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPenn Yan, a village in New York near Keuka Lake, is home to the world\u2019s largest pancake griddle, which is 28 feet in diameter. The griddle is on display on Main Street, and was used in 1987 to make a record-breaking buckwheat pancake.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 New York lawmakers are launching an investigation into the state\u2019s property insurance market as premiums surge, fueled by climate-driven risks, according to the\nTimes Union\n. They say insurers are posting record profits while homeowners face skyrocketing costs, threatening affordability and access to housing.\n\u2014 City councilmembers are pressing Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to enforce a nearly two-year-old law requiring inspections of vacant apartments after neighbors report hazards like leaks, rats and open windows,\nGothamist\nreports. Despite the law passing in December 2023, city agencies have yet to implement the 311 complaint system that would trigger inspections, frustrating tenants and elected officials. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$12.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is a new construction, 3,800-square-foot unit.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$1.1 billion\nfor 590 Madison Avenue. RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler bought the office building from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio pension fund in what is the most expensive NYC office sale since 2022 when the Google parent company purchased 550 Washington Street,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $15 million for a penthouse unit at 515 West 23rd Street. The Chelsea condo is 3,600 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 72,065-square-foot, 11-story residential building with 69 dwelling units. Daniel Bernstein of Kutnicki Bernstein Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The math around the Midtown South rezoning is confusing.\nSpecifically, the adjustments that the City Council made ahead of approving the rezoning underscore just how slippery the housing projections that accompany major zoning changes can be. Were 141 potential housing units lost? Closer to 500? Or 1,000?\nAs part of the environmental review process, the Department of City Planning identifies development sites that are likely to be redeveloped if zoning changes are made, based on a number of factors. That doesn\u2019t mean the agency has received confirmation from the owners of these sites that they will actually take advantage of the rezoning.\nBy the same token, some sites where the owners are keen to redevelop aren\u2019t necessarily included in those projections.\nConsider Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue, a 21-story, vacant office building that was being marketed as a potentially ideal office-to-residential conversion, thanks to the rezoning. The property was part of an area the City Council excluded from a new residential district mapped in the northwest quadrant of the rezoning.\nPer City Council: The rezoning would pave the way for 9,535 housing units. That\u2019s 141 fewer units than the previously projected 9,676 units.\nCity Planning came up with slightly different numbers: In a technical memo detailing the City Council\u2019s modifications to the rezoning, the agency indicated that 193 apartments would be lost as a result of the Council\u2019s changes.\nIt is not clear why these calculations are different.\nThe Council\u2019s carveout in the northwest quadrant did not include any of the 61 \u201cprojected development sites\u201d City Planning predicted would take advantage of the rezoning. It did, however, include one \u201cpotential\u201d site at 240 West 37th Street, where City Planning initially estimated 293 apartments could be built.\nYet, City Planning pegged the projected loss of apartments, due to the City Council\u2019s change in this quadrant, at 76 units.\nPotential sites are considered less likely to be developed in the 10 years following the rezoning (for a number of reasons, such as odd lot shape, tons of commercial tenants or because the lot has already been built out significantly).\nThe unit projections of the seven potential sites were not included in the initial housing estimates released by the city, so it would be weird to say 293 housing units were lost in this area. A City Planning spokesperson said the the 76 units referred to apartments that would have been converted from office space, in addition to the projected sites.\nAnother 117 projected housing units were shaved off the 9,676 units previously estimated because the City Council reduced the maximum residential floor area ratio from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area. I actually checked the four sites affected by this (based on previous unit estimates and lot sizes), and got the same result.\n\nBut that, again, is just on the sites City Planning previously identified as likely candidates for redevelopment.\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, believes these estimates lowball the potential housing lost thanks to the City Council\u2019s modifications. She told\nTRD\nfellow Quinn Waller that she believes the number to be closer to 1,000 units of housing that will not be built across the nearly 40 properties carved out by the City Council (that, of course, assumes those owners would opt to take advantage of the rezoning or sell their properties to someone who would).\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many properties within the carveout areas would have flipped to residential, if ultimately given the chance.\nWe will, however, be able to see how many of the 9,535 apartments in the neighborhood ultimately get built over the next decade. Keep an eye out for more coverage from us on the rezoning.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related books are you reading? Send recommendations to kathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPenn Yan, a village in New York near Keuka Lake, is home to the world\u2019s largest pancake griddle, which is 28 feet in diameter. The griddle is on display on Main Street, and was used in 1987 to make a record-breaking buckwheat pancake.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 New York lawmakers are launching an investigation into the state\u2019s property insurance market as premiums surge, fueled by climate-driven risks, according to the\nTimes Union\n. They say insurers are posting record profits while homeowners face skyrocketing costs, threatening affordability and access to housing.\n\u2014 City councilmembers are pressing Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to enforce a nearly two-year-old law requiring inspections of vacant apartments after neighbors report hazards like leaks, rats and open windows,\nGothamist\nreports. Despite the law passing in December 2023, city agencies have yet to implement the 311 complaint system that would trigger inspections, frustrating tenants and elected officials. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$12.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is a new construction, 3,800-square-foot unit.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$1.1 billion\nfor 590 Madison Avenue. RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler bought the office building from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio pension fund in what is the most expensive NYC office sale since 2022 when the Google parent company purchased 550 Washington Street,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $15 million for a penthouse unit at 515 West 23rd Street. The Chelsea condo is 3,600 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 72,065-square-foot, 11-story residential building with 69 dwelling units. Daniel Bernstein of Kutnicki Bernstein Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A company owned by two New Zealander brothers who built their fortune off toys and consumer products is behind the recent purchase of multiple burned lots in Malibu.\nNick and Mat Mowbray, who founded Zuru Group, also own development company Zuru Tech US LLC. The latter entity and its El Segundo address appear across the deeds and state registration statements tied to nine Malibu land sales that occurred between March and the first half of this month.\nKevin Shelburn, who is the founder of Mar Vista-based Shelburn Realty Group, first unraveled the mystery via a\nvideo he posted\non Instagram.\nThe Mowbrays\u2019 involvement was unknown when\nRealtor.com\nfirst broke news of nine lots on La Costa and Carbon beaches in Malibu selling for a total of $65 million. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe brokered most of the deals on behalf of the buyer.\nThe two declined to divulge the identity of their client in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nlast week.\nEight of the sales tied to Littlefield and Howe in the Multiple Listing Service \u2014 sold for between $5 million and $13.8 million \u2014 all track back to the Mowbrays\u2019 local Zuru entity with the business filings signed off by U.S. director of operations Marcel Fontijn. A ninth lot, which sold for $5 million, was handled by Keller Williams\u2019 Benyamin Illulian and can also be traced to the Mowbrays.\nA message left at Zuru\u2019s El Segundo office was not returned Monday afternoon and an email listed online as the contact for the office bounced back.\n\nThe lots on prime oceanfront real estate could make good case studies for Zuru Tech\u2019s \u201cdigital solution for construction\u201d of homes and commercial buildings. Among the items the company touts on its website is the ability to manufacture prefabricated concrete walls that promise fireproofing and earthquake resistance. The company also uses digital printing for finishes such as wood, marble, stone, metal and other prints and patterns.\nThe Mowbrays founded Zuru Group in 2003 and, according to a late 2024\nBloomberg\nreport, the company was projected to have revenue of $1.7 billion in that same year. The business\u2019 growth pushed the brothers onto the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nZuru first found success with toys like Bunch O Balloons (water balloons that fill up fast and seal themselves) and Mini Brands (think mini Q-tip, Barbasol and other miniatures of brand-name items). The brothers then moved into personal care items with the Rascal and Friends diaper brand, hair car line Monday, and pet food under the label Nood, among several other segments.\nThe Mowbrays didn\u2019t stop there, entering real estate construction with software that allows for homes and buildings to be designed online with the materials produced in the company\u2019s China factory.\nBloomberg reported Zuru acquired its 25-acre factory in China to make homes with plans to send those test structures to Los Angeles this year.\nNick Mowbray told Bloomberg Zuru\u2019s housing business is set to \u201cdwarf everything we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A century-old office tower on Wacker Drive scored a win for owners betting on a shaky downtown market.\nSheridan Capital Partners signed a 25,400-square-foot lease in the Jewelers Building at 35 East Wacker Drive, relocating its headquarters from the Wrigley Building, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe deal is a boost for Prime Group and Chicago-based Clayco\u2019s development arm CRG, which paid $36 million, or $65 per square foot, for the 556,000-square-foot\nlandmark\nlast year. The joint venture bought the building out of distress \u2014 lender John Hancock had filed a $65 million\nforeclosure\nsuit against the prior owner, Toronto-based Dorchester \u2014 wagering that upgrades and targeted tenant improvements could breathe life into the Loop asset. It was the first time the property has changed ownership since 1981.\nIt was about one-third vacant, a little worse than the broader downtown average, when they acquired it. With Sheridan\u2019s move, plus a lease extension by design firm SmithGroup and an expansion by CRG and parent company Clayco, the building is about 70 percent leased. Michael Reschke Jr., executive vice president for Prime Group, said the results show the strategy of modernizing the nearly 100-year-old tower is \u201cyielding great results.\u201d\n\nJLL\u2019s Pat Schenk and Bill Rogers represented Sheridan in the lease negotiations, while Madison Rose\u2019s Adam Pines and Andrew Marty handled the deal for ownership.\nThe lease signals the landlords intend to keep the building primarily an office play. Sources previously told the outlet the buyers\nconsidered\na partial conversion to apartments or hotel rooms, an increasingly common route for vintage office properties squeezed by remote work. A spokesman declined to say whether that remains on the table.\nSheridan is leaving one Chicago landmark \u2014 billionaire Joe Mansueto\u2019s Wrigley Building \u2014 for another. Jonathan Lewis, a partner at Sheridan, said 35 East Wacker offered the right blend of \u201chistoric character and modern amenities\u201d for clients and staff. The Jewelers Building, completed in 1926 and landmarked in 1994, is best known for its 40th-floor cupola, once rumored to house a Capone-era speakeasy and later reimagined by architect Helmut Jahn.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Nicolas, a former professional baseball player, had been with Compass since 2019 and was named one of the brokerage\u2019s top 100 agents for 2024.\nMost of Nicolas\u2019 18-person team is also in the process of transitioning to Serhant, he said.\nNicolas has closed nearly $2 billion in sales since he became a real estate agent in 2016, according to a press release. Nicolas focuses on neighborhoods that include Coconut Grove, Gables Estates, Pinecrest, Ponce Davis and Southwest Ranches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough move to be honest because I am quite happy with Compass,\u201d Nicolas said. Ryan Serhant, founder and CEO of his company, had been speaking with Nicolas over the past three years.\nNicolas said he was excited at the opportunity to start a nationwide luxury division at the brokerage.\n\u201cHim [Serhant] and I have been talking about how we can become the No. 1 team in Miami,\u201d Nicolas said. \u201cWe both want to be No. 1 in all of Florida. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d\nNicolas brokered both sides of the\n$19.3 million sale\nof a penthouse at Grove at Grand Bay in 2023, which marked a record for Coconut Grove condo sales.\n\nA team member of his, William Abreu, also a former professional baseball player, represented the buyer of a massive estate in Davie when it sold earlier this year for a\nrecord $25.5 million\n. Streamer Adin Ross purchased the property.\nNicolas said South Florida\u2019s luxury sector has been stable, with demand still high for turkey homes. He expects demand will grow if\nZohran Mamdani\nbecomes mayor of New York City.\n\u201cThe homes sitting on the market need a lot of work or are teardowns. Your special homes in special neighborhoods are setting records,\u201d he said. Nicolas recently represented the seller in the $6.3 million sale of the home at 7425 Southwest 56th Avenue in Miami, which set a record for the Ponce-Davis neighborhood.\nSerhant aims to open offices in Coconut Grove, Coral Gables and Miami Beach, Nicolas said.\nNicolas\u2019 move marks a win for Ryan Serhant\u2019s brokerage, which has been expanding in South Florida. In May, Serhant brought on\nGary Pohrer\nto help lead the Palm Beach office. Pohrer was part of the Exclusive Group at Douglas Elliman.\nSerhant first expanded to South Florida when it\nopened up shop\nin Delray Beach in 2023. The brokerage now has about 260 agents in Florida, including Tyler Cameron and founding agents Mariana Niro and Chris Prakas, according to state licensing records.\nCompass declined to comment.\n",

Both plans top the building out at 46 stories.\nBy envisioning two potential pathways to moving forward at the site, the companies would have \u201cthe flexibility to respond thoughtfully to market dynamics while maximizing the site\u2019s potential to serve both the university and the surrounding community,\u201d according to a statement cited by the Business Times.\nIn June, an affiliate of Lincoln and McCourt secured the right to acquire the 0.8-acre site at 536 Mission where GGU\u2019s 230,000-square-foot building stands.\n\nIn the deal, Lincoln offered the school a $21.9 million loan to cover its existing debts on its campus property and locked down the option to purchase the property outright in the coming years, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Both would help the private school recoup funds.\nThe office tower would include 9,409 of retail and 23,000 square feet of public open space. The mixed-use variant would include a combination of studio, one- and two-bedroom units as well as 1,784 square feet of retail, 17,250 square feet of public open space and additional square footage for parking.\nGolden Gate University placed the 536 Mission building\nup for sale in 2022\n, though it didn\u2019t attract a buyer the school was willing to work with. Earlier this year, the school\nbegan looking for a partner\nto recapitalize the property.\nUnder the partnership agreement, GGU would have \u201cflexible options\u201d to stay at 536 Mission Street, GGU\u2019s chief financial officer Elaine Clark told faculty and staff, according to the Business Times. If the university decides to relocate, it would do so as early as next fall.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Is the Trump administration using ICE agents to strong-arm landlords for information on tenants?\nA recent advisory from the Arlington, Virginia-based National Apartment Association, which the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas distributed to its members, indicates as much.\n\u201cWhile the U.S. government originally stated that its initial focus would be the removal of non-citizens with criminal convictions, beefing up border enforcement and terminating humanitarian parole programs, enforcement activity has spread beyond those limits, due in part to increasing pressure on ICE to increase its deportation numbers,\u201d the advisory said.\nThe Apartment Association of Greater Dallas counts members ranging from global investors to local landlords and covers one of ICE\u2019s most active areas.\nThe Dallas trade group posted the advisory on its website late last month and then went silent, declining comment when\nThe Real Deal\nasked to follow up on the broad warning.\nThat\u2019s part of a pattern that\u2019s played out on the other side of the landlord-tenant equation in Texas. The San Antonio-based nonprofit immigrant advocacy group RAICES also issued a warning but declined to say whether ICE has been pressuring Texas landlords with illegitimate requests.\n\u201cDespite agency arguments to the contrary, ICE warrants are agency directives and should not be misconstrued as having the same legal authority of judicial warrants,\u201d RAICES spokesperson Faisal Al-Juburi said. \u201cHowever, that does not minimize the coercive threat likely felt by anyone, regardless of status, who is approached by masked individuals claiming to be federal enforcement officials.\u201d\nA Georgia attorney said his landlord clients received subpoenas from ICE requesting tenant information, the Associated Press\nreported\nlast month. However, along with Dallas apartment association and RAICES, various Texas and local tenant associations declined to say whether ICE has been serving subpoenas at Texas apartments, much less whether the agency has used them illegitimately.\nReports of ICE agents serving legal papers at apartment complexes have come with little clarity on whether subpoenas or warrants were involved. It\u2019s not clear whether federal agents were accompanied by local police, or whether landlords or tenants were targets or points of contact.\n\nRumors of ICE inquiries at Texas apartments have been simmering, but little evidence has surfaced.\nState Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos, who represents parts of Dallas, posted on Facebook last month that ICE agents had been spotted knocking doors at apartments on Audelia Road, citing a post on a message board.\nOthers who have been firebrands in opposition to ICE in the past have gone silent more recently when asked for information or comment on the Trump administration\u2019s deployment of the agency in Texas.\nU.S. Representative Greg Casar \u2014 a former member of the Austin City Council\nwho has inveighed against ICE raids in Texas\n\u2014 did not respond to a request for comment on the most recent ruckus over the agency.\nICE has a field office based in Dallas, and North Texas ICE agents have made more arrests than any other regional office. However, available government data is only current through January.\nThe data does not indicate how arrests were made \u2014 worksite raids, apartments sweeps or individual apprehension. Murkiness aside, the Arlington, Virginia-based National Apartment Association clarified its\nguidance\nfor members on the difference between subpoenas and warrants.\n\u201cSubpoenas are demands for the production of information, with a deadline to produce that information sometime in the future. This means that you can accept the document, regardless of the type of subpoena, and then consult counsel with regard to whether or how to comply,\u201d the advisory stated.\nAuthors of the advisory letter include former Department of Homeland Security general counsel Jonathan Meyer, who served in the post during the Biden administration.\nLandlords are not obliged to surrender residents\u2019 information unless ICE has a criminal warrant, according to the National Apartment Association.\n",

        "content": "Investor Babak Ebrahimzadeh sold an office building and an adjacent garage with mixed-use development potential in Riviera Beach\u2019s Singer Island for $16.5 million.\nEbrahimzadeh, through his Miami-based Master Mind, sold the Ocean Blue property consisting of a five-story office building and three-level garage at 2655 North Ocean Drive, according to brokers and records. The buyer is George Jay II, Limited Partnership, an entity tied to real estate investor George Johnnides. The deal closed on Friday.\nRachel Mitrogiannis of Ascella Group and Earl Hollis III of Hollis Realty Group represented the seller. Paul Snitkin of Anderson Carr represented the buyer.\nThe 45,000-square-foot office building and roughly 200-space garage were completed in 1989 on a 1.7-acre site, property records show. Ebrahimzadeh, who paid $8.6 million for the buildings in 2022, completed improvements over the past three years, including floor replacement in bathrooms and hallways; porcelain floor tile installation in the lobby; and other interior renovations. Master Mind invested roughly $3 million in capital improvements, according to Mitrogiannis.\nOcean Blue is about 70 percent occupied, with former professional golfer Greg Norman leasing the penthouse for his business, Mitrogiannis said. Other tenants include Florida Sugar &amp; Molasses Exchange. Los Angeles-based Le Petit Prince Cafe will open in January in the commercial space between the garage and office building.\nBy-right, about 225,000 square feet of residential or other uses can be developed atop the garage, Mitrogiannis said.\nJohnnides plans to lease up the office building first, including the roughly 5,500 square feet of first-floor restaurant space, before pursuing development, according to Snitkin.\n\u201cDown the road, we are going to do something there, but first we will get this asset stabilized,\u201d Snitkin said, adding that Johnnides hasn\u2019t yet decided if he would pursue office or residential development. \u201cWhen we get to that stage, it depends on what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in South Florida, Johnnides has invested in South Beach. In June, he sold the 19,700-square-foot Office Depot-leased building at 1771 West Avenue in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour neighborhood for\n$28.5 million\n.\nEbrahimzadeh\u2019s other South Florida investments include paying\n$5.5 million\nin 2022 for the 10,000-square-foot office building at 1545 Centrepark Drive North in West Palm Beach, with plans at the time to redevelop it into a 12-story office building.\nEbrahimzadeh and Nader Ohebshalom also lead Gatsby FL, an arm of New York-based Gatsby Enterprises. Last year, Gatsby FL bought the 10-story One Town Center office building and attached garage at 1 Town Center Road in Boca Raton for\n$82 million\n.\nGatsby Enterprises also owns the 15-story 800 Brickell office tower and adjacent garage at 800 Brickell Avenue in Miami. It had paid\n$125.5 million\nfor it in 2019.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\noffice market\nhas slowed compared to the leasing and investment sales bonanza during the pandemic. Prime areas such as Brickell and downtown West Palm Beach have continued to boom, while\nsuburban areas and less desirable buildings\nhave felt the sting from elevated interest rates and inflation. The influx of out-of-state companies also has slowed.\nIn March, Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, and Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the Airport Commerce Park office complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach for\n$18.3 million\n.\nIn Brickell, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega is expected to purchase the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami for\n$275 million\n.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio crossed the line into a buyer\u2019s market, with July sales plunging 10 percent compared with last year while inventory crept past the six-month balanced market threshold.\nThe slowdown outpaced the statewide market, which notched a 3.6 percent gain in transactions, according to the San Antonio Board of Realtors. Last month, 2,915 homes sold across the Alamo City, but prices didn\u2019t budge downward, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n. The median home sales price hit $330,000, up 4 percent year-over-year, even as the statewide median slipped 1.1 percent to $345,000. San Antonio is now moving in the opposite direction of Texas overall: more sluggish deal flow, but pricing that\u2019s proving stickier.\nSupply climbed to 6.12 months in July, crossing the six-month marker brokers typically use to mark\nbalance\nbetween buyers and sellers, putting the ball in the buyers\u2019 court. Homes are also sitting longer, averaging 74 days on the market \u2014 a 16 percent increase from last summer. Pending sales fell 24 percent, a sign that some would-be buyers are hesitating despite more choices. Active listings rose 14 percent to more than 17,100.\n\u201cThe leverage is shifting,\u201d SABOR chair Ed Zapata said in the report, noting that buyers are taking their time to weigh options as inventory builds.\n\nSan Antonio is the value play compared with other big Texas metros. Bexar County\u2019s $310,000 median trails far behind Travis County\u2019s $560,000 and Dallas County\u2019s $390,000, while Harris County is level with San Antonio at $330,000. Austin leads on price but has seen sharp corrections since its pandemic peak, while Houston\u2019s vast\nsupply\nhas kept a lid on appreciation. Dallas-Fort Worth is in the middle \u2014 pricier than San Antonio but still drawing buyers priced out of Austin.\nMortgage rates could prove the swing factor. Freddie Mac pegged the 30-year fixed at 6.58 percent last week, its lowest since October and the fourth straight weekly decline. If borrowing costs continue to ease, markets like San Antonio \u2014 with relatively lower entry prices and fresh inventory \u2014 could see\ndemand\nrebound faster than Austin or Dallas, where affordability is more strained.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "You probably weren\u2019t thinking about \u201cgood cause eviction\u201d when you read in\nThe Real Deal\nlast week that Miki Naftali\nplans to demolish\n800 Fifth Avenue after buying it from Eliot Spitzer. But Naftali surely did.\nBecause of good cause, raze-and-rebuild and other value-add projects in New York are\na lot harder\nthan they used to be for free-market buildings. The law, which the state\npassed last year\n, forces landlords to offer lease renewals to most tenants who are current on rent and not axe murderers.\nIf Naftali had to offer renewals to all the tenants at 800 Fifth, he would have to buy them out to get them to leave. That would be prohibitively expensive if not impossible.\nA successful developer such as Naftali would not hand Spitzer more than $800 million for the building, nor did JPMorgan Chase lend him $675 million for the purchase, without certainty that he could empty the 208-unit building and put a condo tower in its place.\nBut it\u2019s more complicated than you would think. And some folks in the real estate industry are wondering whether ambitious tenants could ask Naftali for a buyout and \u2014 citing good cause eviction \u2014 threaten to hold out if he refuses.\nAt first blush, it wouldn\u2019t seem like they have a case: The good cause eviction law does not apply if the building is being demolished.\nBut technically, Naftali is not going to demolish 800 Fifth Avenue. Rather, he will rebuild it. \u201cContextual redevelopment,\u201d the firm said.\nThat is because 800 Fifth is overbuilt, meaning it\u2019s larger than zoning allows, thanks to a special permit that Spitzer\u2019s late father, famed developer Bernard Spitzer, obtained from the city to put up the 33-story tower in the\nlate 1970s\n.\n\nDemolishing more than 75 percent of the building would prevent Naftali from constructing an equally overbuilt tower in its place, according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry. Given the purchase price, construction costs and the incredible premium buyers pay to own on Fifth Avenue, he needs to build as many square feet as is allowed. Rebuilding, rather than razing, will preserve the special permit.\nSo if good cause\u2019s demolition exception doesn\u2019t apply, how can Naftali refuse to renew leases? Because there\u2019s another\nexception in the law\nthat applies to high rents, defined as at least 245 percent of the \u201c\nfair market rent\n.\u201d This year, the high-rent threshold is $6,152 for a one-bedroom apartment.\nThe law doesn\u2019t protect tenants in luxury units. It\u2019s one of the few times that being rich works against you. (A dozen other building types are exempt from good cause, including co-ops, condos, hotels, dorms, religious facilities, income-restricted rentals and properties owned by small landlords.)\nA glance at StreetEasy\u2019s list of\npast rentals at 800 Fifth\nsuggests that all of the units are leased for more than 245 percent of the fair market rent. The only recent leases for one-bedrooms even close to the threshold were Unit 16A, which rented for $7,000 a month in May 2024; Unit 11A, $6,700 in November 2022; and 12A, $6,750 in June 2022.\nMight there be some old-timers who got favorable deals from Bernard Spitzer that his son kept in place? Anyone paying less than 245 percent of the fair market rent could try to shake down Naftali if they were so inclined.\nBut a source said all the rents are north of the threshold. That would rule out the risk of holdouts as a reason Naftali was able to pay about 25 percent less than the\n$1 billion\nthat Spitzer was reportedly asking last winter for the property.\nRegardless, the deal for 800 Fifth Ave is a reminder of the potential complications presented by good cause for anyone looking to upgrade a multifamily building in New York.\n",

        "content": "Cheskie Weisz\u2019s\nCW Realty Group\nhas snapped up a Crown Heights development site after the City Council approved a controversial rezoning of the property.\nThe Brooklyn-based developer bought 73-99 Empire Boulevard for $40 million from a group of investors that includes Manhattan-based\nBridges Development\nGroup and Harry and\nAlex Adjmi\u2019s\nA &amp; H Acquisitions\n, a source with knowledge of the deal said.\nThe sale comes after the City Council approved the rezoning of the long-neglected corner lot, originally developed as a single-story garage, paving the way for a 13-story, 250,000-square-foot mixed-use development with 20 percent of the units set aside for affordable housing.\nNewmark\u2019s Daniel O\u2019Brien and Caroline Hodes arranged the sale.\n\nThe property traded for 167 percent more than the $15 million the development group paid for the property in 2021. That was before Bridges\nsubmitted preliminary plans\nearly last year for a mixed-use development with affordable housing to the Department of City Planning, kicking off the rezoning process.\nThe plan required rezoning from commercial to mixed commercial and residential. At the time, Bridges\u2019 Michael Berfield said the project would include about 250 studio to three-bedroom apartments, more than half of them affordable. The 90,000-square-foot retail portion of the project would also include a grocery, he said.\nThe City Council approved the rezoning in June, despite\nconcerns from local residents\nabout shadows on local play areas for children and fears of gentrification, but with deeper affordability than was initially proposed. The developer must now set aside 20 percent of the project\u2019s units for households making an average of 40 percent of the area median income, with income bands capped at 130 percent AMI, according to the approved rezoning.\nIt was unclear whether Bridges intended to flip the property all along. Representatives from CW Realty and Bridges did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "A high-profile Gold Coast development site has traded hands at a sharp markdown \u2014 less than two-thirds of its 2019 purchase price.\nConvexity Properties, the development arm of DRW Holdings, picked up the corner parcel at 1120 and 1130 North State Street for $39 million from Newcastle Investors, which paid $61 million in 2019, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe nearly 31,000-square-foot property \u2014 home to a long-shuttered Barnes &amp; Noble and a Lou Malnati\u2019s restaurant \u2014 is entitled for a 304-unit, 29-story apartment building. Newcastle secured approval in 2021 after scaling back its initial 42-story proposal, which drew pushback from Ward 2 Alderman Brian Hopkins and neighbors. But the developer never started construction and has now exited at a loss of roughly $22 million.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Convexity will do with the site, though the acquisition expands its\nGold Coast\nfootprint, and zoning entitlements are typically in place for six years. The firm owns the adjacent Viceroy Hotel, a 180-room property that opened in 2017, and has been an active player in upscale redevelopment near Mariano Park.\nRecent projects\nnearby\ninclude the Newberry on the Triangle retail revamp at 1030 North State Street and a wave of restaurant investments that have reinforced the district\u2019s draw.\n\nFor Newcastle, the sale marks a rare retreat in a neighborhood where it has been an aggressive residential developer. Its Gold Coast track record includes the 35-story Bernardin apartments at 845 North State Street and an 89-unit building at 1210 North State Parkway.\nThe discounted deal highlights the challenges developers face when timelines collide with shifting conditions. While Newcastle managed to win zoning approval after redesigning its plan, the company may have balked at moving forward amid high financing costs and inflated construction costs.\nConvexity has a track record of\nrepositioning properties\nin prime locations and could opt for something other than the approved apartments.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Last summer, there were 4,228, while they dipped to 3,972 last month.\nListings are also down for short-term rental, with\nAirbnb\nregistering a 13 percent dip from July of last year, according to AllTheRooms data cited by the Times. Overall short-term rentals in the L.A. metro area fell 44 percent in the same period, according to the report.\nWhile AirDNA reported an 8 percent increase in Airbnb and VRBO listings over the past year, listings have decreased since January in the areas affected by the deadly wildfires, falling 56 percent in Altadena, 36 percent in Pacific Palisades and 25 percent in Malibu, according to the Times.\nVarious factors could be to blame for the decrease in short-term rentals, including the fires as well as local ordinances seeking to crack down on the market.\n\nIn 2018, the City of Los Angeles passed the Home-Sharing Ordinance, which required hosts to get a license and restricted them to renting out only their primary residence. Between 2019 and 2023, listings dropped 70 percent, coinciding with the pandemic.\nLast year, unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County became subject to the ordinance. It hasn\u2019t been able to fully combat\nillegal listings\n, however.\nAs of October 2024, there were an estimated 7,500 violations of the Home-Sharing Ordinance, but only 300 citations, a\nreport\nfrom the Los Angeles Housing Department last year said. In March, the\nL.A. City Council approved\na plan to increase fines based on square footage and to send out a group of staffers to monitor and enforce violations. But last year\u2019s budget didn\u2019t provide for such provisions, leaving many of them unimplemented.\nTo avoid fines ranging toward $10,000 or more, some hosts are turning to mid-term rentals of 30 days or more to skirt short-term rental regulations, according to the Times. Mid-term rentals could present a widely untapped market for hosts across the L.A. area; last year Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb,\ncalled\nmid-term stays a \u201chuge growth opportunity\u201d for the rental platform.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A high-profile legal battle involving a Chinese food hall in San Francisco is heating up.\nLast week, a judge ruled that the China Live restaurant complex at 644 Broadway must pay $6.7 million in disputed rent dating back to 2018, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe ruling has left owner and chef George Chen with few options; Chen told the Business Times he plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. China Live will continue operations unchanged for the foreseeable future as the business \u201csimply needs time to work out a mutually acceptable deal with the bank lender,\u201d Chen said.\nThe China Live complex opened in 2017 and spans 30,000 square feet across four stories.\nFormer landlord Chris Wight of Cypress Properties alleged that between January 2018 and February 2025, China Live withheld rent and other lease obligations.\nWight lost control of the building last year after defaulting on the building\u2019s mortgage, which he claims is a result of Chen withholding rent. Gregg Williams of Trident Pacific was appointed as receiver of the building after the default.\n\u201cAfter five and a half years, we finally achieved justice in court,\u201d Wight told the Business Times of the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cChina Live owes all back rent totaling $6.7 million and had the financial means to pay rent but chose not to, which ultimately forced me into default.\u201d\n\nLast year, after several eviction attempts, China Live reached a settlement with Cypress Properties that would allow the food hall to remain a tenant on the property as long as it keeps up with its rent payments. The status of that arrangement remains unclear under the new receivership.\nThe receiver asked the court to rule China Live\u2019s lease \u201cterminated and forfeited,\u201d according to the Business Times. That would allow Williams \u2014 also the receiver of the\nbeleaguered San Francisco Centre mall\n\u2014 to negotiate new terms with China Live.\nLoan beneficiary Wells Fargo is hoping to resolve any outstanding loan deficiency with Wight after disposition of the property, a legal filing last month cited by the Business Times said. The financial institution is looking to either proceed with a nonjudicial foreclosure or the receiver will sell the property.\n\u201cI am now working closely with the receiver and lender in an effort to maintain ownership of the property with my partners going forward,\u201d Wight told the Business Times, calling the China Live building \u201ca remarkable project\u2026developed with great care\u201d and noting he \u201cremain[s] committed to its future.\u201d\nThe property was assessed at $13.1 million in March, marking a 61 percent decline from the underwriting assessment of $33.8 million and its lowest mark to date, per the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Shvo is seeking to kick Core Club to the curb.\nMichael Shvo\u2019s firm started the process of evicting the exclusive members-only club from 711 Fifth Avenue, the former Coca-Cola Building.\nThe luxury developer and the ritzy social club have been engulfed in a gripping legal drama. In 2024, Core Club alleged Shvo\u2019s team over-promised and under-delivered on opening three club locations and sued Shvo for $600 million in damages. Shvo struck back, calling the lawsuit a \u201cpublic hit job\u201d intended to yield a rent reduction and other concessions.\n\u201cWe have made every effort to keep Core Club in the building,\u201d said Morris Missry, Wachtel Missry, an attorney representing Shvo. \u201cHowever, the tenant\u2019s ongoing inability, or unwillingness, to meet its lease obligations has left us with no choice but to initiate the eviction process.\u201d\nIn the background, Shvo is facing other issues, including negative headlines over his marquee Raleigh condo and hotel in Miami Beach, which could be sold after slow sales.\nSeparately, Shvo is in a dispute with his big-money\nGerman backers\n. Shvo has filed an arbitration claim, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees from the German pension fund BVK.\nCore Club\u2019s new attorney Marc Kasowitz, the company\u2019s third law firm in less than a year, claimed Shvo\u2019s attempt to evict Core Club is pinned to these broader issues.\n\u201cWhat convenient timing for a baseless claim targeting CORE: to be pushed to the press within hours of the Wall Street Journal publishing that \u2018Shvo\u2019s property empire is starting to crumble,\u2019 said Kasowitz in a statement. \u201cThis is nothing more than a desperate stunt by a convicted felon, seeking to deflect attention from his mounting international legal troubles as his real estate portfolio steadily unravels.\u201d\n\nThe litigation with Core Club, encompassing two lawsuits, has been ongoing for over a year. So far, Shvo is winning.\nIn a one lawsuit, a New York state judge recently ordered Core Club to pay Shvo close to\n$1 million\n. Core Club secured a $750,000 loan from Shvo in 2022, but the members-only club allegedly defaulted a year later when Core Club\u2019s location on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue opened up.\nCore Club accused Shvo of a \u201ccomplex, fraudulent scheme\u201d to gain control of its business. A New York Supreme Court judge said those defenses were not applicable. Core Club is appealing the ruling.\nShvo and Core Club are still duking it out in the other lawsuit.\nCore Club alleges Shvo misled the company\u2019s leadership about his ownership in 711 Fifth Avenue and San Francisco\u2019s Transamerica Pyramid, as well as plans for a $100 million buildout. The owners have demanded Shvo and his partners reduce the club\u2019s Manhattan rent, rescind its lease at Shvo\u2019s Transamerica Pyramid and pay $600 million in damages.\nCore Club further alleges Shvo racked up an $80,000 tab at its restaurant and used spaces for events for a kid\u2019s birthday party and weekly religious group meetings.\nShvo fired back, alleging the Core Club\u2019s fraud claims contradicted written agreements. The club\u2019s leases in New York and San Francisco were promised only $50 million in construction allowances, according to Shvo\u2019s filing.\nIn an unusual twist to the legal proceedings, Core Club\u2019s initial lawyer admitted to using artificial intelligence, which produced fake legal citations. He was instructed by the court to pay the landlord\u2019s legal fees.\n",

        "content": "The end has arrived for Yitzchak Tessler at 172 Madison Avenue.\nA federal court judge confirmed a reorganization plan of the developer\u2019s entity that controls the nearly decade-old condo project that will result in Tessler turning over the 10 remaining unsold residential and two commercial units at the 72-unit building to distressed debt investor ArcPe.\nTessler had entered the entity into bankruptcy one year ago to stave off ArcPe\u2019s foreclosure efforts. ArcPe had bought the construction loan on the building from Deutsche Bank for roughly $60 million in Jan. 2024.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go down like this.\nArcPe and Tessler had agreed upon a reorganization plan in June, in which ArcPe agreed to reduce its debt claim to $45.5 million from the original $65 million it was seeking and Tessler agreed to turn over the building\u2019s seven units while keeping the unfinished penthouse units for himself to sell.\nTessler was planning to obtain $35 million in exit financing, which would go towards finishing the penthouse units and paying down the remaining debt. He would also be contributing $3 million personally to pay down administrative expenses and fees.\nBut days before a hearing set at the end of July to confirm that plan, Tessler informed ArcPe that he would not have the funding required to move ahead with the plan as constituted.\nEver the deal-maker, Tessler tried for one last-ditch attempt to hold on to the penthouse units, submitting a status update at around 8 p.m. the night before the confirmation hearing.\n\nIn it, Tessler claimed to have found a co-developer willing to act as a guarantor for a $24.5 million refinancing of the five penthouse units, which would still leave him several million short of the money needed to confirm the reorganization plan.\nThe co-developer, Los Angeles-based Wylan/James, would receive 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the penthouse up to $10 million, and split the remaining sales 50/50, according to the term sheet submitted to the court. Assuming the finished penthouses had a value of $45 million as Tessler posited, he would receive $17.5 million for the penthouses, a far cry from the $98 million he once sought.\nAfter a delayed start to the hearing, in which Tessler\u2019s lawyer Kevin Nash couldn\u2019t access the Zoom, Nash made a plea to ArcPe and its lawyer, Offit Kurman\u2019s Jason Nagi, to consider extending the refinancing deadline and give Tessler time to finish his refinancing efforts, which would still require due diligence and appraisal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity here that Mr. Tessler has isolated with new money and a fresh developer to finish off the construction on these unfinished units,\u201d Nash said in court.\nNagi and ArcPe were ultimately unmoved.\n\u201cMr. Tesler has burned up all of the goodwill he possibly could have had,\u201d said Nagi, pointing to a number of false starts on Tessler\u2019s part in terms of obtaining financing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d he concluded.\nThe marketing for the unfinished penthouse units and the seven finished units will be handled by a Serhant team, including Jordan Hurt and Jessica Taylor. ArcPe\u2019s David Gordon said he expects sales to begin after Labor Day.\n",

By committing to the entire building at 2300 Main, Hyundai notched O.C.\u2019s largest lease deal so far in 2025.\nIt\u2019s not Hyundai\u2019s only corporate outpost in O.C.\nHyundai Capital leases offices at 3161 Michelson Drive, while Hyundai Glovis bought the 128,813-square-foot building at 18191 Von Karman Avenue in April for $35.7 million. Hyundai Motor America owns the Korean company\u2019s 503,536-square-foot U.S. headquarters at 10550 Talbert Avenue in Fountain Valley.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear which Hyundai company leased the space at 2300 Main Street. The Hyundai name is used in various closely related companies based in South Korea including Hyundai Motor Group for vehicles, Hyundai Heavy Industries Group for shipbuilding and heavy machinery, and Hyundai Group for elevators and logistics. Hyundai Capital provides automotive financing options, while Hyundai Glovis handles logistics and supply chain management.\nThe 2300 Main Street building was previously leased by OptumRX and was developed by Irvine-based LBA Realty in 2002. Today, the five-floor office building is owned by Germany-based Manova Partners with Houston-based Hines serving as the property manager and CBRE handling leasing.\nHyundai Glovis\u2019 lease for 53,282 square feet in Irvine was the second-largest lease in O.C. in the first quarter, according to a Colliers office market\nreport\n. Irvine\u2019s Airport Area, where 2300 Main Street is located, is the county\u2019s largest office submarket. The Main Street building was the second largest piece of leasable space in the Airport Area, according to Stream data cited by the Business Journal.\nOffice leasing activity in Orange County is picking up, CBRE said in its latest office market\nreport\n. In the Southern California county, office leasing activity was up 23 percent quarter-over-quarter, with 279 deals for 1.8 million square feet of space signed in the second quarter of this year.

        "content": "Jeffrey Feil is being shaken down by yet another lender with the latest in a series of setbacks for his firm\u2019s commercial property investments in Chicago.\nHis struggles are emblematic of the\nlanguishing market for midsize loft-style offices\nas well as Loop high-rises while his firm struggles to satisfy lenders on each type of asset amid the downturn for commercial real estate stemming from remote work trends.\nPrivate equity giant KKR\u2019s securitized loan servicer K-Star Asset Management filed a foreclosure lawsuit this week against a venture of Feil\u2019s company, New York-based Feil Organization, in Cook County court. It alleges the landlord has defaulted on debt tied to a four-story, 35,000-square-foot loft office building, constructed in 1872, at 1027-1031 West Madison Street in the hot West Loop area.\nFeil bought the building in 2018 for $13.1 million, or $374 per square foot, using an $8.5 million loan originated by Citibank\u2019s real estate division. The loan was later sold off to investors in bonds backed by commercial property debts, opening up the financial details of its performance to the public.\nThe lender says Feil still owes over $8.2 million on the loan, after accounting for interest and fees following an April default on the mortgage, Cook County records show. The loan wasn\u2019t supposed to mature until the fall of 2028, but has since become more than three months delinquent as the building\u2019s vacancy lingers. The lender says Feil proposed a workout solution for the troubled debt, but K-Star found the terms unacceptable. The details of the proposal haven\u2019t been disclosed.\n\nThe property was fully leased through 2023, and brought in more than $1 million in revenue \u2014 plenty to cover the costs of debt service and operating the building, according to loan data. But its occupancy dropped to less than 50 percent last year, when it brought in only a little more than $437,000 in net cash flow, loan data shows.\nFeil didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney representing K-Star.\nThe alleged loan default is the landlord\u2019s latest blunder in Chicago\u2019s office market. Feil already surrendered a similar loft office building in River North, when it handed lender Beltway Capital the keys to 730 North Franklin Street last year to resolve a $15.3 million foreclosure lawsuit.\nPlus, Feil is facing a lawsuit brought by special servicer\nRialto Capital for an alleged default on a $105 million CMBS loan\ntied to 10 South LaSalle Street, a 781,000-square-foot building in the Loop. Feil has said it\u2019s working on resolving the dispute, but a receiver has been appointed to operate the property while the litigation plays out, loan data indicates.\nFurthermore, Feil is seeking either forbearance or another loan modification for a\n$75 million debt tied to the North Riverside Park Mall\nin suburban Chicago. The firm poured $9 million into renovating the 447,000-square-foot mall interior in a project that wrapped up last year, but it missed the maturity date on the loan, which is also a CMBS deal. The lender is considering Feil\u2019s request for another maturity date extension, after it already granted one to allow the mall renovation project to be completed, loan data shows.\n",

        "content": "The Bay Area could get nearly 500 additional Opportunity Zones as part of President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d\nThe\nOpportunity Zone 2.0 program\n, first introduced with President Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017, was made permanent with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, opening up a total of 480 census tracts in the Bay Area to greater investment, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe San Francisco region stands to benefit the most from the plan, which offers tax incentives to those investing in low-income communities. There are 346 potential Opportunity Zones in the counties within the city\u2019s metro area, while down south in Silicon Valley, there are 134 census tracts that qualify under the federal government\u2019s new tax and spending changes to the Opportunity Zone program, according to the Business Times.\nAlameda County, home to enclaves like Oakland and Berkeley, topped the list with 105 potential Opportunity Zones. San Francisco and Santa Clara counties followed with 88 zones each.\nContra Costa County is next with 66 possible Opportunity Zones, according to census data analyzed by the Business Times.\nElsewhere in the San Francisco region, Solano County has 22 such zones, Sonoma County has 13, Marin County has 12, and Napa County has six. In Silicon Valley, Monterey County has 26 possible Opportunity Zones, Santa Cruz County has 14, and San Benito County has six.\n\nUnder the original\nOpportunity Zone program\npassed as part of Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, 42,176 census tracks were eligible to become designated Opportunity Zones. But in the new version of the program, the number of eligible tracts could drop by more than 20 percent.\nIn the new law, Congress changed the definition of \u201clow-income community\u201d to census tracts with a median household income not exceeding 70 percent of an area\u2019s median income \u2014 a decrease from 80 percent previously. It would also make any census tract that has a poverty rate above 20 percent eligible for the program.\nThe federal government hasn\u2019t published an official list of eligible tracts yet. Governors have July 1 of next year to identify their targeted tracts for the program.\nCalifornia leads the country\nfor most tracts eligible for the program, with 2,738 pieces of land available for investment incentives. Los Angeles County tops the list with 846 tracts eligible for Opportunity Zone 2.0 tax breaks.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "TLC Management purchased a Vernon Hills apartment complex for $100 million, marking the biggest suburban multifamily trade so far this year.\nInvestor Stuart Handler\u2019s Chicago-based company acquired The Mil\u2019Ton, a 294-unit, three-building property at 1155 Museum Boulevard, from financial services firm\nMesirow\n, according to property records first\nreported\nby CoStar News. The price amounts to $340,100 per unit.\nMesirow bought the asset in 2018 for $87.1 million and listed it in March with CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck, Jillian Jaeger and Tricia Carolan.\nThe firm rebranded the property as The Majestic Luxury Apartments after a round of amenity renovations that included the clubhouse, gym, coworking areas, yoga space and pool. The seven-story complex, built in 2004, is 94 percent occupied with asking rents averaging nearly $3,000 a month.\nThe deal underscores how suburban Chicago has become a magnet for large-scale trades in recent months. A development slowdown has buoyed rents, making the metro the No. 2 market in the U.S. for rent growth, according to CoStar. That rent strength fueled a string of blockbuster sales late last year, including a record $148 million deal for the 352-unit E2 in Evanston, a $109 million trade for Naperville\u2019s 417-unit Railway Plaza, and a $101 million-plus sale of the 306-unit Wheaton 121.\n\nSo far this year, investors have poured $2.4 billion into Chicago-area multifamily, compared with $3.9 billion for all of last year, a figure boosted by the late-2024 flurry. The Vernon Hills acquisition shows momentum hasn\u2019t cooled, even as the development pipeline shrinks.\nMesirow is doubling down on multifamily. The firm announced in May it had raised $1.25 billion for a new national apartment fund, a 66 percent increase, with plans to target top-tier markets across the U.S.\nTLC\nhas been equally aggressive. In addition to the Vernon Hills pickup, it recently paid $60 million for the 192-unit Top of the Mount in\nMount Prospect\n, adding to a sprawling suburban portfolio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The projects are still early, but Ersa Grae Principal Reza Ebrahimi said the firm hopes to deliver lots at the Riley Road tract within a year, with home construction on the FM 1488 parcel following within two years.\nThe communities are expected to feature 50- and 60-foot lots. No builders have been selected, though the firm will likely tap two or three familiar partners for each site, Ebrahimi told the outlet.\nThe plans add fuel to a submarket already seeing massive new supply. Nearby, Airia Development Company is underway on Colton, a 5,700-acre, 11,000-home master-planned community east of the Riley tract. The Texas market for homes in master-planned communities ranks\nsecond\nonly to Florida.\n\nElsewhere on the edges of the metro, Signiorelli and D.R. Horton are planning a 1,000-home community in\nrural\nFort Bend County.\nErsa Grae, founded by the late Ali Ebrahimi after fleeing Iran in the 1980s, has been a longtime player in Texas land development, delivering master-planned projects such as Silver Ranch, Falcon Ranch and StoneCreek Estates. The firm is also working on a community in Brookshire, west of Houston.\nWaller County, which is adjacent to\nMontgomery County\n, has become a magnet for developers chasing demand from buyers priced out of closer-in Houston suburbs. Population growth and new infrastructure have fueled steady lot absorption. Ersa Grae said its projects will be positioned to catch that wave.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Midtown, especially around Grand Central, is booming. But not for everyone.\nThe ground lease for the office building at 1140 Sixth Avenue has seen a massive valuation drop to the tune of 90 percent; it was appraised at $180 million in 2016, and today it\u2019s worth just $17.8 million, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe value per square foot, at $70, is cheaper than it once was to\nlease\nat the location. In 2012, the landlord\nasked $85 per square foot\nto rent.\nThe drop is startling considering that the neighborhood has generally done well post-pandemic. But the owner, American Strategic Investment Co., has been strapped for cash and losing tenants.\nThe 20-story building was constructed in 1931, according to tax records. Private equity giant Blackstone purchased a defaulted loan on the ground lease for about $100 million. The owner set upon a $40 million renovation.\n\nThat investment paid off. The firm\nsold the interest\nto American Strategic Investment Co. in 2016 for $180 million. The company was then called American Realty Capital\u2019s New York City REIT.\nIn the summer of 2016, the company took out $99 million in loans for the building. But occupancy fell quickly. By 2019, it fell from 91 percent at underwriting to 79 percent, according to Morningstar Credit. At its lowest, in 2021, the building was more than 30 percent vacant.\nNet operating income also took a hit. Once $9.5 million in 2016, it was just $1.6 million in 2023. The biggest tenant in the building is currently City National Bank, which occupies 14 percent of the space. The bank signed a lease until 2033, but at a reduced rent. The second largest tenant, a coworking space operator, received a rent abatement through part of 2024, according to Fitch Ratings. The ground lease payment is $4.75 million per year.\nOwnership hasn\u2019t made a dent in its outstanding balance, with an effective interest rate of 9.1 percent, according to the latest federal financial filing. The loan was transferred to special servicing in April. The servicer\nfiled for foreclosure in June\n, saying the owner doesn\u2019t have the funds to carry the ground lease and has agreed to cooperate. Loan documents entitled the lender to receiver in the event of default, and a judge approved in July.\nNeither special servicer LNR Partners nor American Strategic Realty Co immediately responded to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Some people lose money on real estate because they know nothing about it, others because they know too much.\nAn example of the first group would be New Yorkers who purchased Hamptons homes from a former taxi business operator named Michael O\u2019Sullivan, who had bought them in foreclosure but failed to pay off the delinquent mortgages.\nIn some cases, a lender would later force a foreclosure auction, leading to a nightmare scenario in which the winning bidder knocks on the door and tells the unfortunate residents that he is now the rightful owner.\nNewsday just published an\nextensive piece\nabout O\u2019Sullivan and his pathetic buyers, many of whom were Latino immigrants and spent six figures on renovations before discovering they had been misled.\nThe article began with a woman who put down $75,000 toward a $475,000 purchase of an East Hampton home, spent $100,000 making it habitable and then discovered an outstanding mortgage of $619,500.\nIn a traditional home purchase, the buyer obtains title insurance from a company that guarantees the title is clear. Buyers also typically hire a real estate lawyer to go over the contract, which in O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s deals was often filled with red flags.\nA basic internet search for \u201cHow to buy a home\u201d would quickly spell this out for anyone new to the process. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s customers could have avoided disaster by Googling \u201chow to buy a home in foreclosure.\u201d\nI don\u2019t mean to blame the victims. Many spoke little or no English. Several said they trusted O\u2019Sullivan, who called his company Hamptons Dream Properties, because they were referred to him by Lourdes Alban, a Spanish-speaking real estate agent.\nAlban later left Saunders &amp; Associates for Nest Seekers International in Bridgehampton. Nest Seekers\u2019 Geoff Gifkins told Newsday it is \u201creviewing the situation and gathering the facts before we rush to judgment.\u201d\nOne question the brokerage should ask Alban: Would you buy a home from O\u2019Sullivan without doing a title search?\nAlban told reporter Jonathan LaMantia, a former colleague of mine, that she \u201cdid not work with [O\u2019Sullivan] at all.\u201d That is not the same as saying she never referred potential homebuyers to him.\nThe second type of duped real estate investor is someone who thinks he knows what he\u2019s doing but doesn\u2019t, such as people who funded ventures through the crowdfunding site\nYieldstreet\n. Another journalist I worked with, Hiten Samtani, quoted one burned investor in his newsletter,\nThe Promote\n:\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by without me saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe what happened,\u2019 Justin Klish, who invested $300K in the\nFlow project\nvia Yieldstreet, told CNBC. \u201cI consider myself moderately financially savvy, and I got duped by this company.\u201d\nA truly savvy investor would assume that people raising money on crowdfunding platforms probably could not get traditional financing because their ventures were problematic.\n\nA lot of venture capitalists have put money into crowdfunding platforms \u2014 that is, into the platforms themselves. I would like to know how many of these VCs have also invested in the risky schemes raising money on these same platforms. I bet it\u2019s a very short list.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre problems such as neglected repairs,\nuncollected maintenance fees\n, self-dealing and financial malfeasance more likely to occur at\nHDFC\n(permanently affordable) co-ops or at traditional co-ops? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Google Maps sometimes pins the wrong location for an address, but will correct mistakes if users report them. I discovered this upon checking Google\u2019s photo of\n960 Franklin Avenue\nin Brooklyn, which was once a spice factory, then an empty lot and now is a condo construction site. It was never an apartment building with a fire escape, which is what Google Maps showed. That building turned out to be on Washington Avenue, on the other side of the block. Here\u2019s the corrected version:\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Contenders for the three downstate casino licenses are nearing the end of the road, with the next hurdle being community advisory committees,\nGothamist\nreported. These committees hold immense power to advance or sink bids.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams is once again suing the Campaign Finance Board over its denying him millions of dollars in public matching funds, according to\nThe City\n. This is his second suit. His first was dismissed in May by a judge who upheld the board\u2019s concerns over the integrity of Adams\u2019 fundraising.\n\u2014 Given Andrew Cuomo\u2019s means-testing housing proposal last week, following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze the rent of rent-stabilized units,\nCity &amp; State\nbroke down New York City housing units by type. According to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, of the 3,705,000 units counted, market-rate led the stock with 1,119,000. Coming in a close second were rent-stabilized units with 960,700.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$7.25 million\nfor a 2,829-square-foot condominium unit at The Belnord, 225 West 86th Street on the Upper West Side.\nCorcoran\u2019s Kirsten Jordan\nhad the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$205 million\nfor the 129,231-square-foot office building at 510 West 22nd Street in Chelsea.\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nin May on Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s sale to MKF Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27 million\nfor a 12,270-square-foot house at 247 Central Park West on the Upper West Side.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 19,865-square-foot, 34-unit residential property at 1537 Vyse Avenue in Crotona Park East. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Gedalya Feldman.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Seaport Entertainment Group is taking a haircut on the development site for the controversial Seaport Tower.\nTavros Capital is in contract to purchase the site at 250 Water Street for $150.5 million from Seaport Entertainment Group,\nBisnow\nreported. This is an about-face for the seller, which last year spun off from Howard Hughes Holding in a deal backed by billionaire Bill Ackman, after it sunk $220 million into the purchase and air rights and spent years tied up in legal wrangling over the site.\nSEG President and CEO Anton Nikodemus said in a statement that the sale would \u201csupport new sustainable growth opportunities and create long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d\nHoward Hughes bought the site for $180 million in 2018 after the previous owner, the Milstein family, repeatedly failed to secure building approval. Hughes pledged to pay $40 million for 234,630 square feet of\nair rights\nfor the South Street Seaport Museum, and shortly after that got building approval. But this deal soon became a point of contention.\nIn 2022, the South Street Seaport Coalition, a community preservation group, filed a lawsuit challenging the Landmark Preservation Commission\u2019s approval. A judge\nvoided that approval\nin 2023, citing the air rights deal as\u00a0 \u201cimpermissible quid pro quo\u201d between the developer and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. That decision was\nreversed\nabout six months later and the court declined to hear an appeal from the preservationist group, allowing the developer to\nfinally proceed\nwith construction.\n\nThe firm cleared another hurdle when the 421a construction completion deadline was extended to 2031, allowing the development to receive the crucial tax abatement it needed for the deal, which included 399 units with 100 designated affordable, to pencil out.\nNevertheless, SEG\nannounced\nits intention to sell the site back in March. JLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton and Nicco Lupo represented the firm in this deal, which is expected to close before the end of the year.\nNearby, the firm\nrecently signed\na 20 year, 75,000 square foot lease with immersive art exhibitor Meow Wolf at Pier 17.\n\u2013 Quinn Waller\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade Property Appraiser Tomas Regalado is seeking higher market valuations for a handful of signature properties and development sites in the county.\nDuring a two-day span of July 29 and July 30, the property appraiser\u2019s office filed separate lawsuits in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against 17 owners that scored reductions in their properties\u2019 market values in 2024, which in turn led to lower property tax bills.\nSome of the defendants include affiliates of New York-based investment giant\nBlackstone\n, Indianapolis-based national shopping mall owner\nSimon Property Group\n, Miami-based cruise line Royal Caribbean Group and San Francisco-based industrial real estate investment firm\nPrologis\n. Regalado\u2019s office is also suing affiliates of KAR Properties, Alex Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development,\nSwire Properties\n,\nMelo Group\nand RER Ventures that own seven separate development sites in Miami-Dade.\nThe practice of seeking to redo market valuations for trophy properties and development sites via litigation began under Regalado\u2019s predecessor, Pedro Garcia, who was Miami-Dade Property Appraiser from 2008 until 2024. In a phone interview, Regalado said he\u2019s not as aggressive as Garcia.\n\u201cLast year, my predecessor filed 65 cases,\u201d\nRegalado\ntold\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cWe only filed 17 this year. The bottom line is that we are diminishing the number of cases that this agency used to file.\u201d\nStill, the 17 property owners his office is suing \u201cgot a huge discount,\u201d and \u201cthey should not have received that kind of reduction,\u201d Regalado said. His staff had already begun negotiating settlements with 10 owners prior to the lawsuits being filed, he added.\nShahab Karmely, CEO of\nKAR Properties\n, was the only defendant who responded to requests for comment from\nTRD\n. Regalado\u2019s office is suing two KAR affiliates that own a Miami River assemblage in the city\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nIn general, property appraisers across the nation often overestimate the value of development sites, Karmely told\nTRD\n. \u201cWe have this unfortunate pattern where the value of raw land that produces no income is arbitrarily increased,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be mathematically justified.\u201d\nFor instance, property appraisers take into account what can be developed on the land, but don\u2019t factor in rising interest rates and construction costs, high inflation and the fact that new construction starts have slowed.\n\u201cEvery year that passes, they are like, \u2018We are going to tax you more,\u2019\u201d Karmely said. \u201cWe have all these headwinds, but somehow these parcels are worth more. I wish that was the case, but it is not.\u201d\nRegalado said he agrees with Karmely, but the property market value haircuts provided by the Miami-Dade Value Adjustment Board to the 17 owners went too far. Still, he has instructed the property appraiser\u2019s legal staff to work out settlements, Regalado said.\n\u201cMy commitment is to make sure that our team looks at a property\u2019s income, looks at market conditions and tries to settle cases for the benefit of the owners,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cAnd if they prevail in court, we\u2019re going to respect the decision. We will not appeal at all.\u201d\nHere are the properties that are targeted in the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuits:\nCruise Terminal A, 2000 North Cruise Boulevard, Miami\nAn affiliate of Royal Caribbean and London-based investment firm Icon Infrastructure that owns the cruise ship terminal allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $68.8 million to $53.7 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states. The affiliate also allegedly incorrectly received a reduced taxable value of zero dollars from the Miami-Dade County Value Adjustment Board.\nDolphin Mall, 11401 Northwest 12th Street, Sweetwater\n\nTwo affiliates of Simon Property Group that own the 1.4 million-square-foot\nDolphin Mall\nallegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $603 million to $500 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.\nBlackstone\u2019s Miami-Dade portfolio\nAn affiliate of\nBlackstone\nand its industrial subsidiary, Link Logistics, that owns 21 industrial sites in the county, mostly in Doral, allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the market value of the properties from a combined $549.6 million to $460 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.\nMidtown Development sites, 110 Northeast 36th Street and 3055 North Miami Avenue, Miami\nThe property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states that an affiliate of Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development that owns a 3.5-acre vacant site at 110 Northeast 36th Street allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from\u00a0 $73.7 million to $42 million. The site is currently used as a green space adjacent to the Target at Midtown Miami\u2019s retail center.\nAnother Midtown Development affiliate that owns a nearly 5-acre site at 3055 North Miami Avenue allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $95.1 million to $54.2 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states. Midtown is partnering with Carlo Rosso\u2019s Rosso Development to build the\nMidtown Park\nmixed-use project, which will also include the 28-story, 288-unit Midtown Park Residences by Proper condo tower.\n2.8-acre development site, 700-799 Brickell Avenue, Miami\nAn affiliate of Swire Properties that previously owned a 2.8-acre development site at 700-799 Brickell Avenue allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $98.8 million to $67.9 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. Swire abandoned plans for a supertall office building, and in May the firm sold the site to Miami-based Melo Group for more than\n$200 million\n.\nAria Reserve development site, 711 Northeast 23rd Terrace, Miami\nAn affiliate of Melo Group that owns the 5-acre development site in Miami\u2019s Edgewater neighborhood allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $81.6 million to $66.3 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. Melo Group is planning to develop the property into\nAria Reserve\n, a two-tower project with 800 condos.\nFaena Residences development site, 90 Southwest Third Street, Miami\nAffiliates of KAR Properties that own a Miami River assemblage allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $55 million to $39.2 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. KAR is partnering with Fortune International Group and Alan Faena to develop\nFaena Residences\n, a two-tower project with 440 condos.\nRER Ventures development sites in Coral Gables and Kendall\nAn affiliate of Miami-based RER that owns a 2-acre development site in Coral Gables and a 0.8-acre lot in Kendall allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the properties\u2019 market value from $46.2 million to $6.5 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states.\nWarehouse, 3760 West 108th Street, Hialeah\nAn affiliate of Prologis that owns a two-story warehouse in Hialeah allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $78.7 million to $53.9 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.",

        "content": "Cain International and OKO Group\u00a0got the green light from the Beverly Hills City Council in the wee hours of Wednesday morning to designate a Community Facilities District that could allow One Beverly Hills\nto receive up to $550 million\n\u2014 twice the city\u2019s annual operating budget \u2014 in bond financing.\nThe council would still have to approve future bond issuance within the specific area, which the developers of the mixed-use project expect to seek closer to the project\u2019s 2028 completion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for One Beverly Hills,\u201d Vice Mayor John A. Mirisch, who voted against the project in 2021, said at the meeting, which started at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. He added, \u201cNow I do feel very comfortable that this is a good deal for the city.\u201d\nOf the $550 million, $390 million would be used to fund public improvements and $160 million would be allocated for \u201cfuture city council to fund major repairs or enhancements to the public improvements decade from now without needing to revisit voter approvals,\u201d according to a council staff presentation at the meeting.\nThe special taxes would be levied on properties within the 17.5-acre project site at 9850, 9876, 9900 and 9988 Wilshire Boulevard between Wilshire Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, slated to include an Aman resort, two condominium towers and the renovation of the neighboring Beverly Hilton hotel. The revenue would then be used to repay the bonds.\n\u201cThe CFDs really act like takeout financing,\u201d Larry Green, managing director at Cain, said at the meeting. \u201cIt is not a gift or a subsidy. There is no financial risk to the city, and there is no impact to the existing taxpayers outside of the CFD.\u201d\nCain International and OKO Group are targeting 177 Aman-branded residences, of which 20 are under contract, the project\u2019s representatives said at the council meeting.\n\nOne Beverly Hills, which is already under construction, also calls for 4 acres of open space reserved for condo residents and 4.5 acres open to the public. Amenities include a conference center, retail and dining space.\nCFDs were established by the state\u2019s Mello-Roos Act of 1982. They are formed when property owners in a geographic area agree to impose a tax on property to fund infrastructure improvements or services.\n\u201cCFD is a tool that\u2019s customarily used for this type of investment, and it allows us to borrow this money and refinance these improvements at a lower rate than what we could get through a traditional loan,\u201d Green said.\nEarlier this year, Cain and OKO\nsecured $300 million in mezzanine financing\nfor the project from Vici Properties. In 2024, they reportedly nabbed\n$2 billion in financing\nfrom a group of lenders led by a $500 million senior loan from JP Morgan.\nOne Beverly Hills was approved by the City Council in 2021. The developers announced the groundbreaking in February 2024 and the project is expected to be completed in 2028.\nThe site was\nonce occupied\nby a Robinsons-May department store and gas station.\n",

        "content": "Just over halfway through Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s term, he\u2019s facing major political headwinds with a recent approval rating of 25 percent and potential candidates already circling to challenge him in the 2026 primary.\nThe city\u2019s real estate market has been a mixed bag over the course of what could be the mayor\u2019s only term,\nleading the country in rent growth\nwhile landing close to the bottom in rankings of construction activity, recent studies have shown.\nSo what does the real estate community think of Johnson? The sentiment isn\u2019t much rosier than his poll numbers. And his performance so far could foreshadow some pitfalls that the similarly progressive New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani might face if elected this fall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a heck of an uphill battle against him,\u201d Chicago-based LG Group founder and CEO Brian Goldberg said of Johnson.\nHigh-stakes fights over\na transfer tax\nand\nan anti-gentrification ordinance\nsoured relations between the industry and Johnson\u2019s administration while some YIMBY-friendly wins have gotten overshadowed.\nBut not all of the blame for the city\u2019s development stagnation can be placed squarely on the mayor, which players like Goldberg acknowledge.\nInvestors and lenders have been getting cold feet because of\na chaotic property tax system\nrun by Cook County, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently\ndropped an investigation\ninto the longstanding practice of aldermanic prerogative, an unwritten policy that has been blamed for slow housing progress for decades.\nThe Real Deal\nresearched several policies and interviewed a selection of real estate professionals and the Deputy Mayor of Economic Development to score the effectiveness of the administration\u2019s real estate-related efforts so far.\nRead through the scorecard or jump to a policy of interest here.\nEliminating parking minimums - A\nNorthwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance - D\nA $1.25 billion affordable housing and economic development bond - B\nReal Estate Transfer Tax - F\nCut The Tape permitting efficiency campaign - C\nSubsidies for office-to-resi conversions - B\nProposal to allow ADUs citywide - B\n1. Eliminating parking minimums\nThe policy:\nIn a win for developers, City Council passed an ordinance that eliminates minimum parking requirements in much of the city.\nThe ordinance expanded developers\u2019 ability to forgo parking anywhere in the city that is served by public transit, including in residential neighborhoods. Parking minimums still apply in non-transit served areas but developers can request exceptions.\nThe ordinance was originally proposed by Alderman Daniel La Spata and backed by the Mayor.\nReal Estate POV:\nReducing parking requirements has been tested successfully in other cities as a way to increase density while reducing development costs and some in Chicago are taking notice of the change.\n\u201cConstruction lenders will be able to get more aggressive with pricing and more deals will pencil out,\u201d said Alex Cohen, an associate with Interra Realty.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe new parking policy is part of a broader goal to increase density throughout the city.\n\u201cParking may not seem as sexy but it can create additional density, as well as shave off some of the costs that developers have,\u201d said Deputy Mayor of Economic Development Kenya Merritt.\nGrade: A\nThe policy is an evidenced-backed way to increase density and ultimately housing supply which is a win for developers and politicians alike. Now the ball is in the real estate community\u2019s court to test the process out. If tweaks to the policy are needed, they\u2019ll be less substantial and easier to implement than the initial ordinance.\n2. Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance\nThe Policy:\nWhen two Alderman\nmade an about-face on an anti-gentrification pilot program\non the Northwest side, it signaled a growing hesitancy to follow through with more progressive real estate policies.\nThe Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, which was developed by a group of Aldemen, created a pilot area in parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, West Town and Pilsen. In it, tenants were given the right of first refusal if a landlord sells a building and existing demolition fees were increased for developers seeking to replace multi-unit buildings with single family homes.\nThe area lost 6 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nBut after outcry from longtime property owners, city council later voted to remove parts of the 31st and 36th wards from the pilot area.\nReal Estate POV:\nThe anti-gentrification ordinance often gets cited as a dividing line between real estate players and the administration in general, even though it didn\u2019t originate from the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cIt affects people that have owned homes here for years and years when Logan Square was a lot rougher,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s broker Joe Freeman said. \u201cThe hoops and obstacles you have to go around with that ordinance before you sell a property are pretty insane.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nMerritt pointed to $8 billion worth of projects that have advanced through the city\u2019s Planning Commission so far this year as evidence that the city\u2019s policies are not having a chilling effect on overall growth and investment.\n\u201cWe recognize that business and driving our economy can happen in an equitable way, and so far, we\u2019ve been able to realize that. Those two things can live and exist at the same time,\u201d Meritt said.\nGrade: D\nThe mayor was not a vocal supporter or detractor of the ordinance but staying on the sidelines cost him an opportunity to shore up political capital with people on either side of the debate.\n3. A $1.25 billion affordable housing and economic development bond\nThe policy:\nA $1.25 billion bond\naimed at funding affordable housing was a hallmark of Johnson\u2019s campaign. Unlike some of his other high-profile proposals, this one earned the endorsement of industry groups like Illinois Realtors.\nSince it passed in 2024, the bond has funded the creation of a city-run revolving loan fund for affordable housing known as the Green Social Housing program and\nsubsidies for developers\nbuilding housing on vacant lots known as the Missing Middle program.\nReal Estate POV:\nThe bond program\u2019s payoff\nrelies on the expiration of most TIF\nor Tax increment financing districts.\nTIF districts allow developers to use property tax revenue generated by a project to offset certain infrastructure costs. In some areas they have set off a wave of new projects while in others they have failed to entice developers. They\u2019ve also been criticized for siphoning taxes away from entities like Chicago Public Schools.\nIndustry groups like Illinois Realtors were okay with the city phasing out certain TIFs to fund the bond but other players worry about the impact of losing access to the tool. About 40 percent of the city\u2019s TIF district are set to expire in the next three years and city finance officials have said extensions will be considered on a case-by-base basis.\n\u201cIs nobody using it because developers don\u2019t need it or is nobody using it because the people who need it don\u2019t know it exists, or know how to access it?\u201d said Corey Oliver, CEO of Community Venture Investment Corp.\nOthers question whether the city can boost affordable housing as cost-effectively as private developers can, given the extra scrutiny the city places on publicly-backed projects.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code,\u201d South Side Builders Association President Andy Schcolnik said. \u201cBut they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe bond\u2019s approach to promoting housing comes in two forms: a pilot program funding direct grants of up to $150,000 for developers repurposing vacant lots and a revolving loan fund for mixed-income housing projects. Both bring down construction costs for developers more than if the developer had relied on the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program instead, Merrit said.\n\u201c[LIHTC] certainly comes with a lot of requirements that are imposed by the federal government in terms of how you implement the affordability portion of it and so that drives up the cost per unit,\u201d Meritt said. \u201cBut when you think about other other models, like our Missing Middle program or what we\u2019re going to be doing with Green Social Housing, those costs per unit are more in alignment with what you\u2019ll see in the private market.\u201d\n\nGrade:\nB\nPassing the bond was a major feat but deploying the funds efficiently to help re-fill the city\u2019s development pipeline will determine its success. Plus, the full impact of phasing out TIF hasn\u2019t been felt yet.\n4. The Transfer Tax\nThe policy:\nPerhaps the most controversial plan to come out of the mayor\u2019s office so far was a proposed increase to the transfer tax on property sales over $1 million which was dubbed the \u201cBring Chicago Home,\u201d initiative.\nThe tax, which was sent to a citywide vote in March 2024,\nwas defeated at the ballot box\nin part thanks to\na well-funded opposition campaign\nled by industry groups like Illinois Realtors and the Neighborhood Building Owners Association.\nReal Estate POV:\nFunding from the tax was going to be used to address homelessness, although critics questioned if the plan was detailed enough to warrant support.\n\u201cHow are you going to use this transfer tax to actually house the homeless? It was just a lackadaisical plan, and I think he shot for the moon and landed in the mountains,\u201d Freeman said.\nAdditionally, at a time when construction starts are at historic lows and institutional lenders are sitting on the sidelines, opponents to the plan argued it would stifle economic growth in the city.\n\u201cA lot of people who have money in Chicago have had it in their family for generations \u2026 a lot of people would have stayed in their spot for a long time until that mansion tax would have been repealed,\u201d Freeman said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe city\u2019s policies thread the needle of enticing investment and promoting equity, Merrit said.\n\u201cThe city is open for business, we\u2019re just not for sale,\u201d Meritt said, quoting Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in place policies, initiatives and practices that demonstrate that we are pro-business, that we are pro-development.\u201d\nGrade: F\nFor some players, the transfer tax fight cemented an \u201cus-against-them\u201d mentality between the industry and the administration. Even developer-friendly wins passed after the transfer tax vote have been cast in a negative light by skeptics. Proponents of the tax feel let down by the vote and for both sides of the debate, perception is reality.\n5. The Cut The Tape campaign\nThe policy:\nOne of the mayor\u2019s earliest priorities was issuing an executive order to streamline processes for approving both residential and commercial building projects. The program, known as the,\n\u201cCut The Tape\u201d campaign\n, targeted 14 different departments.\nReal Estate POV:\nMany developers\nidentified little meaningful change\nin how long it takes to get shovels in the ground, especially for affordable housing projects.\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s Cut The Red Tape campaign was a facade and lip service,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThe new Planning Commissioner, Ciere Boatright, and some of the staff changes there have been significantly better and more efficient than past administrations but I can\u2019t necessarily credit Brandon Johnson.\u201d\nThe same sentiment applies to rehabs, Schcolnik said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a steeple chase \u2026 you\u2019ve got to be jumping through hoops all the time,\u201d he said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nIn a one-year review of the program, Boatright said the Plan Commission has cut review timelines from 135 to 79 days and her department has accelerated rezoning and land disposition, moving more than 1,000 properties toward new uses.\nGrade: C\nChanges are happening. Whether they\u2019re happening fast enough or who can take all the credit for them is open for debate but the city has committed to continuing to make changes based on feedback from developers.\n6. Subsidies for office-to-resi conversions\nThe policy:\nOne of real estate\u2019s early wins during Johnon\u2019s term came when he decided\nto continue a program to subsidize office-to-residential conversions\nalong LaSalle Street that was originally proposed by his predecessor, Lori Lightfoot. Johnson had initially put the program, known as LaSalle Street Reimagined, on hold but as office foreclosures continued to surge and the city\u2019s vacancy rate remained stuck above 25 percent, the administration picked up where Lightfoot left off.\nTo apply for the program, developers must set aside 30 percent of the units in their project as affordable. So far, six projects totalling over 1,800 units have been approved and the first one broke ground at 79 West Monroe in March.\nThe city-backed projects alone will convert nearly 2 million square feet of office space into residences. While helpful, CBRE found the central business district alone has 40 million square feet of vacant office space as of the second quarter of 2025.\nReal Estate POV:\nGoldberg said he is happy that money is getting set aside for the program but questions whether its impact will be limited to LaSalle Street. Goldberg\u2019s firm LG Group led an office-to-residential conversion at 330 South Wells years before LaSalle Street Reimagined took effect but it recently ran into trouble when it was\nhit with a $27 million foreclosure\nthis June.\n\u201cThis amount of money, applied to only a few projects, is meaningful to those projects specifically and will not have much of an impact on such a large expanse of dense urban city space,\u201d Goldberg said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nSince approving the six initial projects funded by the program, the upcoming subsidized conversions have spurred a wave of eight new privately-funded conversion proposals, Merritt said.\n\u201cNow we have a total of 14 projects downtown that are taking vacant commercial space and pivoting it to residential, creating density and making our downtown a neighborhood.\u201d she said.\nGrade: B\nAny effort to reduce office space and create more housing is a win for the loop and the fact that both subsidized and non-subsidized projects are moving forward shows the program is working as intended. The overall impact on the downtown vacancy rate will be an important metric in evaluating the program\u2019s success in the future.\n7. Allowing ADUs\nThe policy:\nChicago is reviving a citywide plan to legalize coach houses and other accessory dwelling units, a move that could reshape residential density rules \u2014 and reignite political tensions \u2014 across the city.\nA proposal currently making its way through City Hall\nwould remove zoning restrictions that have prohibited ADUs on many lots citywide since the 1950s. A pilot program was instated in 2021 with mixed results.\nReal Estate POV:\nIndustry players welcome the idea of expanding ADU zoning but question its overall impact.\n\u201cI know a lot of my North Side colleagues like the ADU program and they felt like the expansion of it was necessary for us on the South Side,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cBut we have other headaches and issues here when we\u2019re looking at sustainable development.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nADUs will compliment the city\u2019s density goals, but will not be the only solution city leaders pursue.\n\u201cThe mayor is driving us to create a wide swath of options for people where people can live and ADUs gives us the ability to do just that,\u201d Merritt said.\nGrade: B\nChanging zoning to allow more density is an important way to spur development and bring housing costs down, but policies allowing ADUs in other areas of Chicago and across the U.S. have had mixed results so far.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 new head coach is settling into Halas Hall as well as Lake Forest\u2019s luxury housing market.\nBen Johnson and his wife, Jessica, dropped $3.25 million, or $522 per square foot, in March on a 6,200-square-foot mansion a short drive from the team\u2019s headquarters, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Johnson, who came over at the beginning of this year from the Detroit Lions after three years as offensive coordinator, bought the six-bedroom home, at 922 Oak Knoll Drive, via a land trust that concealed the couple\u2019s identity.\nBuilt in 2013, the property mixes classic North Shore grandeur with modern perks: 10-foot ceilings, radiant-heated floors in every bathroom, a walnut-paneled office, expansive mudroom and a kitchen with high-end appliances, as well as a spiral staircase.\nThe lower level packs in entertainment features \u2014 a theater room, rec room with a wood bar, and a gym. The 2.5-acre lot boasts a sports court, bluestone patio, outdoor fireplace and built-in grill. A three-car garage with radiant heating and copper-trimmed roofline completes the package.\n\nThe sellers listed the home in February for $3.35 million and struck a deal with the Johnsons in just five days. Compass agent Ellen Chukerman represented the buyers. Meanwhile, the couple is exiting Michigan: their four-bedroom home in Plymouth, listed in July for $1.1 million, is under contract.\nJohnson isn\u2019t the first Bears coach to plant roots in Lake County\u2019s high-end\nenclaves\n. His predecessor, Matt Eberflus, bought an 11,300-square-foot lakefront estate in Lake Bluff for $3.9 million in 2022, a year before he was fired and picked up by the Dallas Cowboys as defensive coordinator.\nLake Forest and its neighboring towns have long been favored by Bears brass for their proximity to Halas Hall and stock of sprawling\nmansions\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The \u201cpay-to-delay\u201d provision in Dallas\u2019 city code is safe after the city council voted down a measure to kill it.\nOn Wednesday, the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to preserve the ordinance, which allows property owners near a proposed development to delay a zoning case by paying a $150 fee and submitting a formal request. Once postponed, the zoning case is rescheduled no earlier than four weeks later.\nThe vote highlighted a rift between the council and\ncity staff\n. Mayor Eric Johnson has made it a priority to simplify development, and the City Plan Commission and the Zoning Ordinance Advisory Committee recommended that the council end the ordinance. As one resident who testified against the amendment put it, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that cutting red tape for developers is job number one\u201d for the mayor and staff.\nA delayed zoning case can stunt developments. Assistant City Manager Robin Bentley called the amendment an improvement for \u201cprocedural efficiency\u201d in a memo.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the existing code called it their last resort against unwanted development.\n\nThe city council will review a presentation this week on Dallas Zoning Reform, a broad platform also backed by the mayor and city staff.\nThe plan aims to trim outdated zoning rules, clarify the development process and diversify Dallas\u2019 residential stock. Few concrete suggestions are public, but the\npresentation\ngestures to allowing accessory dwelling units by right, eliminating special use permit renewal requirements and protecting the character of existing single-family neighborhoods.\nThe city expects to send drafted code changes to the city council for consideration early next year.\nThe Dallas City Council also\napproved\na zoning plan for\nWest Oak Cliff\nlast week that will facilitate small multifamily and retail development in a 35-acre district centered on Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive.\n",

        "content": "Holt Lunsford Commercial is taking on multifamily development, planting a flag in Denton with a project aimed at capturing population growth and lifestyle demand.\nThe Dallas-based firm launched HL Communities, a multifamily development division, and started its first project, a four-story, 104-unit complex called the Renegade, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Colo Development Partners is the co-developer, and Harmony Bank is providing financing/\nThe property, rising at 260 West Mulberry Street, is near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the University of North Texas and Texas Woman\u2019s University. Just off the Denton Downtown Square, the development will span 120,000 square feet and is set to deliver in the second quarter of next year. Pre-leasing is scheduled to begin early next year. Units will range from 481 to 1,246 square feet, with more than half designed to include home offices, a nod to the hybrid work era. Planned amenities include a clubhouse, gym, study areas and pet-friendly features.\nArchon Corporation is designing the complex, and Westwood Residential will handle leasing and management.\nLunsford is best known for large-scale industrial development, including Denton Point Business Park. It also develops office, retail and institutional projects, and the firm offers commercial tenant representation and property management services.\n\nWith\nHL Communities\n, the company plans to pursue three product types: boutique infill like the Denton project, suburban garden-style projects near job hubs and wrap developments that pair structured parking with high-density housing.\nThe timing could prove favorable. While the DFW region has been flooded with multifamily supply \u2014 developers delivered more than 40,000 units through mid-2025 \u2014 the pipeline is thinning. Units under construction have dropped by about 17,000 year-over-year, and Colliers projects that number could fall to fewer than 18,000 by next year. Occupancy in Class A properties has already tightened back to 95 percent, and average rents edged up last quarter to $1,503.\nWith the Dallas Fort-Worth Metroplex\nadding\nmore than 480 people per day through births and migration, Managing principal Hayden Lunsford said the bet is on staying power.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Krasnoff\u2019s special servicing giant Rialto Capital put the landlords of some South Loop retail in its crosshairs.\nThe owner of the retail spaces at the base of two Michigan Avenue condo towers are facing an $11 million foreclosure lawsuit brought by Rialto on behalf of bondholders in a securitized loan offering.\nNew York investor Steven Waldman\u2019s Crowd Realty Advisors owns the first-floor retail space for the condo buildings at 1400 and 1250 South Michigan. Waldman and Austin-based investor James R. Gatlin are guarantors of Crowd Realty\u2019s purchase, which was bought from the condo buildings\u2019 developer Russland Capital in 2015.\nA\nfundraising brochure\nfrom the time of Crowd Realty\u2019s purchase shows the firm sought accredited investors to buy into the property. Crowd Realty sought to raise $12.2 million, with $4.4 million in equity and $7.8 million in debt.\nWhile the South Loop retail market is considered a little quieter than the River North scene on the other side of the Loop, its struggles have been less high-profile than the nearly 30 percent vacancy rates posted on the Magnificent Mile in the wake of the pandemic.\nHowever, there have been multiple rough patches for South Loop retail landlords, including just to the north of Waldman\u2019s property at 833 South Wabash Avenue, where a 75,000-square-foot retail and office building was seized through a foreclosure auction earlier this year by the bondholders in a separate CMBS deal after its previous owner\u2019s default on a $9 million loan, according to loan data.\nOver 9 months in 2024, the retail at 1400 South Michigan brought in about $640,000 in revenue with about $330,000 in expenses, according to Morningstar Credit. The property was not bringing in enough revenue to service the debt in 2024, and revenue fell by close to 40 percent between 2019 and 2024. Loan servicer notes compiled by Morningstar show the borrower intended to sell the property as the loan was reaching maturity.\nThe properties were purchased under a Delaware Statutory Trust led by Waldman called CRA 1250 &amp; 1400 DST. The entity\u2019s structure allows an investor or company to sponsor the purchase of a property, while other investors purchase fractional interests in the property.\nProperty records show the trust paid at least $9.6 million for the retail parcels between the two buildings in 2015.\n\nWaldman and Gatlin did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit alleges Crowd Realty defaulted on its $7.8 million loan tied to the two buildings. The owners first missed a payment in May 2020, and the loan was put into forbearance in October 2021. It reached maturity in March this year, at which point the debt had ballooned to $11 million in principal, interest, fees and deferred payments, the lawsuit said.\nRussland Capital, operated by Alex Vaisman and Jacob Bletnitsky, developed 1400 South Michigan with 257 condo units and 1250 South Michigan with 229, in 2008 and 2005, respectively.\nRetail tenants at 1400 South Michigan include a grocery store, a sushi restaurant and a breakfast restaurant called Chicago Waffles, while 1250 South Michigan is rented to Jimmy Johns, a cafe selling THC products, a nail salon, a spa and a dry cleaner. One retail space at 1250 South Michigan is vacant and available for lease.\nBenjamin Lissner, a Baird &amp; Warner dealmaker, said residential property values at the two buildings have remained relatively stable since they went up. Lissner has sold condos at both buildings.\nProperty values rose between 2015 and 2020, then took a hit during the pandemic, Lissner said. New construction around 1400 South Michigan has caused some unit values to dip, but there haven\u2019t been major price fluctuations, he said.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen dramatic drops in either building, or dramatic increases in value,\u201d Lissner said.\nMeanwhile, condos in high-end buildings on and near the Magnificent Mile on North Michigan Avenue have struggled to retain the values they achieved during the run up to the pandemic, with multiple units in the\nBloomingdale\u2019s building at 900 North Michigan\n, for instance, trading for prices seen back in the 1990s.\nIf the retail spaces do go into foreclosure, Lissner said he doubts that will have a big impact on the value of the residential condos in the buildings, even if the commercial values drop.\n\u201cIf any of those tenants move out because of the foreclosure, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have much of an effect on the property values on the building,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Madison Capital could be preparing to take control of one of San Francisco\u2019s largest cryptocurrency headquarters.\nThe New York-based investor has bought a loan from Affinius Capital backed by 600 Battery Street, a 125,000-square-foot building near Jackson Square currently functioning as the headquarters of crypto company Ripple, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nDetails about the deal, including how much Madison paid to take on the loan, are unclear, though Madison is reportedly believed to have paid more than $80 million, a source told the Business Times.\nSquare Mile Capital, predecessor to Affinius, originated a $106.2 million loan for TMG Partners and Invesco when the two firms acquired the building in 2019 for approximately $115 million. That transaction placed the building\u2019s value at roughly $920 per square foot.\nRipple set up shop at 600 Battery Street in 2022 when it leased the entire building for its headquarters. It ended up being one of the largest new lease deals in San Francisco that year, according to the Business Times.\n\nThe 600 Battery Street building is three stories tall, though the nearly 1-acre parcel it sits on is zoned for construction up to 84 feet high, per the Business Times. In 2006, the city received an application to add three stories to 600 Battery, which would\u2019ve increased the building\u2019s height to 77 feet and total space to 218,000 square feet. That plan was withdrawn in 2010 but the site\u2019s zoning would allow Madison to try a similar expansion if it wants.\nThe Battery Street buy grows Madison Capital\u2019s Bay Area portfolio.\nIn 2022, the firm, together with Meadow Partners, grabbed the Ford Point commercial and industrial space in Richmond for $103.7 million. The following year, Madison acquired Seagate Technology\u2019s operational headquarters in Fremont for $260 million; later that year, Madison and Taconic Capital provided $40 million in financing for Ridge Capital Investors\u2019 acquisition of 180 Howard Street in San Francisco.\nRipple will remain the tenant at 600 Battery Street, and it remains to be seen whether Madison will move to buy the building outright.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio leaders will decide this week whether to advance negotiations for a new Spurs arena that could anchor a multi-billion-dollar entertainment district downtown.\nThe San Antonio City Council is expected to vote Thursday on a term sheet for the $1.3 billion project, the first step toward binding agreements with Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nThe arena would rise on the site of the former Institute of Texan Cultures at Hemisfair, with capacity for up to 18,500 fans. The deal calls for Spurs ownership to put up at least $500 million and cover any cost overruns. The city would contribute up to $489 million or 38 percent, whichever is lower, not counting the roughly $60 million needed to acquire the site. Bexar County would shoulder another 25 percent of costs \u2014 capped at $311 million \u2014 through hotel and rental car taxes, pending voter approval in November.\nThe financing\nplan\nrelies heavily on development around the arena. Spurs ownership and private partners would be required to build $1.4 billion worth of housing, retail, office and hotel projects on city-owned land in Hemisfair \u2014 a downtown grouping of city parks, the Tower of the Americas and the former Institute of Texan Cultures building currently being demolished \u2014 phased over 12 years. The first phase alone would include at least $500 million of construction, including a boutique hotel for visiting NBA teams, before the arena opens.\nThe Spurs\u2019 lease at the Frost Bank Center on the city\u2019s Eastside runs through 2032, and construction of the new facility could take nearly five years, lining up with the start of the 2032\u201333 season. Under the proposed lease, the team would pay $4 million in annual rent, escalating 2 percent each year, while retaining all arena revenues and operating responsibilities.\n\nThe term sheet also sets aside $75 million in community benefits over 30 years, or $2.5 million annually, that the Spurs would provide to the city for programs still to be determined. The team has floated childcare and transit subsidies, along with discounted tickets and local contracting pledges.\nIf voters reject the county\u2019s\nvenue tax\n, the deal could collapse. The Spurs have played occasional home games in Austin, Mexico and France under their current non-relocation agreement, but the new deal would lock the franchise into San Antonio for 30 years and set a limit of one foreign game per season and two home games within 100 miles of the Frost Bank Center (a range that would include Austin) per season.\nThe\nproject\nis pitched as more than an arena \u2014 city officials are banking on it as a catalyst for a convention center expansion, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue, a land bridge over Interstate 37 and about 50 acres of mixed-use development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That same year, Santa Monica business consultant Gunjan Bagla created a petition to send to Prime Minister Narenda Modi asking for a consulate in L.A., LAist\nreported\n.\u00a0 The entreaties came as Bass\u2019 predecessor as mayor, Eric Garcetti, served as U.S. Ambassador to India.\n\nLast year, Modi announced that he planned to open new consulates in L.A. and in Boston. \u201cI had asked for suggestions from you for two more consulates,\u201d Modi told Indian Americans in New York, LAist and India Today\nreported\n. \u201cI am happy to announce that after reviewing your suggestions, India has decided to open two new consulates in Boston and Los Angeles.\u201d\nThe Consulate General worked with NAI Capital to find the right place to plant a (orange, white and green) flag.

The new space \u201cprovides a world-class office environment\u201d for the consulate \u201cat the heart of the city,\u201d thereby \u201cmaking its essential services more accessible to the Indian American community across Southern California.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles area has the second-largest population of Indian Americans in California after the Bay Area. The Indian consulate in San Francisco opened in 1957. Up until now, India was the only country with a world top-5 economy without a diplomatic office in L.A.\nAn opening date for the consulate is yet to be announced.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lenders just closed a refinancing deal for one of Hollywood\u2019s oldest continually running film studios.\nWells Fargo Bank and Barclays provided Hackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital a three-year, $165 million financing package for Raleigh Studios, a 314,940-square-foot film studio on Melrose Avenue, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The debt amounts to $524 per square foot.\nNetflix leases most of the property as a global hub for some of its biggest-budget deals, including projects with production companies owned by Barack and Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Shonda Rhimes.\nThe financing will be used to repay $135 million of existing debt. The property has been fully occupied since 2018, with Netflix taking up 94 percent of the space. The streaming giant is about halfway through a 10-year lease at the property, where it\u2019s required to spend a minimum amount on lighting and grip equipment each year. MBS Group, a production service and equipment provider affiliate of Hackman, manages the property.\nRaleigh Enterprises has maintained ownership of all or some of the property since 1979 and has invested $40 million on renovations and expansion over the years. Today, the Los Angeles-based firm holds 30 percent ownership. Aside from Netflix, the rest of the space on the campus is taken up by a Raleigh affiliate leasing 10,050 square feet and smaller leases with Technicolor Federal Credit Union and Sunshine Kids.\n\nRaleigh Studios was founded in 1915 and boasts 13 sound stages with 135,350 square feet of office and support space. Hackman acquired a 36 percent ownership stake in the studio after the pandemic, while Affinius, under its previous name Square Mile Capital, took a 34 percent ownership piece.\nFilm and TV production in Greater Los Angeles has tumbled in recent years as companies look outside Hollywood to film their projects, avoiding high production costs and industry unpredictability. Production activity in the L.A. region fell more than 22 percent in the first quarter, L.A. Business First\nreported\n. Studio occupancy last year was at 63 percent, down from 69 percent the year prior.\nIn an attempt to lure filmmakers back to town, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed into law an increase on the state\u2019s film and TV tax credit program to raise the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The law also increased the percentage of a production\u2019s qualified expenditures that can be offset by tax credits from 20 percent to 35 percent.\nIn the meantime, some studio owners are\nturning to adaptive reuse\n, while others are hopeful the industry in Los Angeles will bounce back and crews will fill their soundstages once again.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The\nlisting\nprice is more than double the current record for the priciest sale in Monterey County, set last year with a $45 million\nmanse in Pebble Beach\n.\nFilm lovers might recognize the Spindrift Road property from the 1992 thriller \u201cBasic Instinct.\u201d The home was also featured in an episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d set in the nearby city of Monterey. The property was also previously owned by world record holding aviator Steve Fossett.\nColorado-based software entrepreneur Gary Vickers and his wife Kerry Vickers are the sellers. The couple listed the seaside estate for more than $52 million in 2019 as well as the main home as a standalone listing for $29.6 million in 2022. They\u2019ve since completed an $11 million renovation and added more land to the property after grabbing an additional 1.3 acres in 2023 for $1.7 million, per the Business Journal.\n\nIn total, the property spans almost 5.4 acres and consists of five parcels and six houses, including the main house, four cottages and a new one-bedroom residence. The 12,000-square-foot main house boasts eight bedrooms, five fireplaces, a commercial kitchen with 1,250-bottle wine refrigerator, an outdoor pool, a steam room, a dry sauna and a four-car garage.\nIf a buyer wants to build more on the property, they\u2019ll be able to take advantage of more than an acre of open, developable land. The Vickerses took the initiative by adding new living structures, landscaping improvements and a water well to the new land. That land is in the process of being entitled to allow for the addition of another primary residence and several accessory dwelling units.\nRenovating and creating the Seacliff for sale today was Vickers\u2019 \u201ccrowning achievement,\u201d the seller said in a statement, per the Business Journal.

        "content": "Trammell Crow Residential scored a $66.4 million construction loan for a 338-unit apartment complex in Margate.\nThe deal comes as financing for new South Florida residential projects continues to flow, despite elevated interest rates, slower lease-ups and other headwinds.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow, the multifamily development arm of Crow Holdings, plans the apartment complex with five five-story buildings on a 9.2-acre vacant site at 785-795 South State Road 7 and an adjacent empty lot, according to records. The mortgage filing indicates the project will be under Trammell Crow\u2019s Alexan multifamily brand.\nTrammell Crow bought the development site for $9.8 million from 777 Properties, which is led by Michael Shooster, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. U.S. Bank is the construction financing lender.\nShooster is CEO of Margate-based Shooster Holdings Corporation, which oversees phone answering, virtual receptionist and contact center services. Shooster also is listed as a real estate developer for Margate-based 777 Properties.\nIn September, the Margate City Commission approved the proposal for the apartment complex, city records show. At the time, Rez Se Land, an entity led by developer Saul Perez, filed the application.\nPerez is reportedly partnering with Trammell Crow on the project.\n\nCrow Holdings, led by Michael Levy, has invested in several South Florida apartment properties, and its\nTrammell Crow\nsubsidiary has completed multiple projects in the tri-county region. Nationwide, Trammell Crow has completed more than 285,000 units in the past four decades, according to its website.\nIn July, Crow Holdings paid\n$97.5 million\nfor the 376-unit 33 West Apartments complex with 14 three-story buildings and two one-story buildings at 6300 Southwest 24th Place in Davie. In December, Trammell Crow sold the 250-unit Solena Miramar complex at 3155 Southwest 147th Terrace in Miramar for\n$67.5 million\n, after completing it last year.\nIn 2022, Trammell Crow and Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm Carlyle completed the 368-unit Casero Apartments complex at 8255 Park Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County\u2019s Fontainebleau neighborhood. The pair sold it for\n$156 million\nin 2023 to Stockbridge.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nleasing and rent growth has calmed compared with the pandemic bonanza. That\u2019s due to a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state residents and a supply overhang from recent years\u2019 development frenzy.\nYet, developers continue to score\nconstruction financing\n, saying that demand and rent hikes will resume by the time their projects are completed.\nOak Row Equities landed\n$210.5 million\nin financing in June to build the 38-story, 324-unit 2900 Terrace apartment tower on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development is a project partner.\nIn Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek area, Grover Corlew scored a\n$92 million\nconstruction loan in June for the seven-story, 312-unit apartment building at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way. In Davie, 13th Floor Investments and JSB Capital Group nabbed a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan in March for the 383-unit, five-story Parks at Davie apartment complex on the northwest corner of Davie Road and Southwest 37th Street.\n",

        "content": "An office tower near Greenway Plaza has traded hands for the second time in less than two years, after the seller repositioned it amid a choppy market.\nDML Capital bought the 15-story tower at 3555 Timmons Lane, a 227,000-square-foot building in the Greenway-Upper Kirby submarket at the beginning of August. JLL Capital Markets secured acquisition financing from an unnamed insurance company for DML Capital, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but Harris County appraisal records peg the Class A property\u2019s taxable value at $19.9 million.\nThe seller, Dallas-based\nNovel Office\n, acquired the building in December 2023 and invested at least $1.4 million into upgrades. Those improvements paid off in terms of leasing. Occupancy jumped from 55 to 95 percent, with 17 tenants signing leases since renovations began. Notable deals include Goode Company Restaurants relocating its headquarters into more than 9,000 square feet, and law firm Hicks Davis Wynn expanding its footprint to over 13,000 square feet.\nAnchored by the Houston-Galveston Area Council, which takes up roughly a third of the building, the building\u2019s roster has diversified with tenants in energy, real estate, tech, law and wealth management. The building, completed in 1982, underwent a major renovation in 2017. Novel\u2019s most recent work included a lobby overhaul, restroom and corridor upgrades, two new chillers and an enhanced conference center.\n\nAs older commodity towers\nstruggle\nwith vacancies, buildings that have been refreshed and repositioned in strong submarkets are luring tenants and attracting capital. The tower is \u201ca building with excellent bones that has been thoughtfully upgraded to meet modern workplace standards,\u201d JLL broker Michael Johnson said.\nFor DML Capital, the deal adds to a growing portfolio of Houston offices. In June, the firm acquired 3250 Briarpark Drive, a 200,000-square-foot Westchase property that serves as Mattress Firm\u2019s headquarters.\nThe back-to-back trades highlight a rare case of value creation in Houston\u2019s office sector, where most sales have been distressed in recent years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Goldman sought approval in May for a stalking-horse bid of $10.1 million, according to bankruptcy court documents, though he had valued the site at $14 million.\nMaxi Capital provided financing for the deal, said Avery Hall principal Brian Ezra, adding the firm is weighing \u201cmultiple uses\u201d for the property.\nThe sale marks the latest in the\nunraveling of Goldman\u2019s Brooklyn empire\n, which ballooned to a billion dollars before collapsing under mountains of debt, liens and lawsuits. His company, All Year Holdings, was dismantled piece by piece after bankruptcy officers seized control of it in 2022 and sold off the assets.\nThe Bedford Avenue site was not owned by All Year, but was one of Goldman\u2019s personal holdings. He picked it up in 2014 for $7 million and poured the foundation for a 100-key hotel designed by ODA, according to the bankruptcy filing. But when the pandemic hit, funding dried up, interest payments stopped and mechanic\u2019s liens piled up to more than $1.4 million.\n\nGoldman owed Downtown Capital Partners some $45 million on the project after default interest ballooned on the original $10 million loan, according to court documents. Rather than foreclose, lender Gary Katz let Goldman place the property into bankruptcy, ensuring unsecured creditors get at least something back.\nThe property was expected to go for $13 million to $15 million, Katz said at the time. But it attracted no bidders besides Avery Hall, according to court filings.\nMeanwhile, All Year\u2019s restructuring team is\nchasing down Goldman\u2019s alleged \u201chandshake deals\u201d\nwith Brooklyn pals, including his neighbor and yeshiva buddy Yoel Silberstein. Goldman, facing a barrage of questions, has repeatedly pleaded the Fifth.\nKatz and a lawyer for Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Construction is expected to begin by the end of the first quarter of next year, according to a spokesperson.\nThe tower will include four restaurants by Casa Tua: Terra, Uva, Fuocco and Vento; a three-story sky garden, co-working studios and wellness spaces.\nFortune recently attended the Real Estate Expo Argentina, a two-day fair in Buenos Aires, where the brokerage marketed eight projects to potential buyers and investors, including Ora by Casa Tua, Defortuna said. He\u2019s seeing strong demand from\ninternational buyers\nhailing from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina.\nFortune also tapped the EB-5 program to help fill the capital stack for Nexo Residences, a short-term rental-friendly condo project it\u2019s co-developing with Jorge Savloff\u2019s Blue Road at 13899 Biscayne Boulevard in North Miami Beach. The developers secured\na $73.3 million construction loan\nfor the planned 16-story, 254-unit building last month from Bank Hapoalim.\nThe Trump administration has been\nworking on its $5 million gold card\nvisa program, another potential option for wealthy foreigners seeking U.S. citizenship. EB-5 has been in existence since 1990.\n",

        "content": "An affordable apartment building near Alamo Square is set to rise after spending a decade in planning limbo.\nThe plan for the 107-unit building at 650 Divisadero Street is moving forward after the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development filed a notice of intent to request up to $45 million in federal funding to operate the project, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. Under the proposal, developers would convert a two-story former auto body shop leased by a seismic retrofit company into a 10-story apartment building for low-income locals.\nThe site has been in various stages of planning since 2014, the outlet reported. Last year, the city approved a loan of $15 million for developers Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Developers to acquire the property from Divco Group.\nDivco had planned to build a 66-unit development with 20 percent of the units set aside for affordable housing. Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Development, a housing and jobs training nonprofit based in Bayview, are sponsoring the 650 Divisadero development in partnership with the mayor\u2019s housing and community development office.\nFederal and city funding will complement the low-income housing tax credit equity that is primarily financing the project.\nThe development will have 27 units set aside for families experiencing homelessness. The remaining 90 units will go to residents who make up to 50 percent of the city\u2019s median income, generally defined as one person making less than $54,550 or $77,950 for a household of four.\n\nJonathan Rose Companies specializes in affordable housing developments and has so far built 18,000 units across 17 states. The New York-based firm is currently building its first development in San Francisco, a 112-unit affordable housing project, at the\nHunters Point Shipyard\n.\nIt won\u2019t be the first time Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Development team up on a project.\nIn 2021, the city chose the two developers to build the affordable housing portion of the 88 Bluxome Street development in South of Market, which would consist of 150 affordable units out of 1,500 from developer Strada Investment Group. The project has yet to start construction, however.\nConstruction on the 650 Divisadero project is slated to begin late next year with move-ins beginning in 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s multifamily market is wobbling under the weight of too much supply, but some investors see the moment as the best buying window since the Great Recession.\nOccupancy dipped to 85 percent in August, with rents sliding 7.5 percent year-over-year to an average of $1,405 to try and reduce those vacancies, according to ApartmentData.com. The rent drop has taken property values down along the way, making financing more difficult, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBut the reset is creating opportunities.\n\u201cThere are a ton of buyers coming to Austin, but not many sellers, so there\u2019s a real scarcity of quality listings,\u201d Newmark Group\u2019s Patton Jones told the outlet.\nThe slump stems in part from a construction rush that left Austin among the most oversupplied\nSun Belt\nmarkets, and high interest rates that curtailed investors\u2019 ability to borrow. With the 30-year fixed rate averaging 6.58 percent last week, capital is tight.\n\nThe tide could turn quickly, however.\nConstruction\nstarts are down roughly 80 percent as lenders shut off financing for new projects. At the same time, demand hasn\u2019t vanished \u2014 more than 21,900 units were absorbed in the past year. Analysts project that beginning next year and through 2029, much of the glut could be burned off, setting the stage for tighter vacancies and rent growth.\nMeanwhile, deals are getting done. Washington-based Weidner Apartment Homes recently bought The Alden, a 349-unit complex in Cedar Park, most recently appraised at $76 million. In nearby Leander, sponsors Beacon Real Estate Group and Constellation Group recapitalized The Conley, a 259-unit property built in 2020, through a loan from LaSalle arranged by Berkadia.\n\u201cOccupancy, rents and concessions certainly present a challenge in the near-term, but in the mid- to long-term, the capital markets see value in Austin,\u201d Matt Nihan, senior director of mortgage banking at Berkadia.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
