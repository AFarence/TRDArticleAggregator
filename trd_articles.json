        "content": "Manhattan office landlords fearful of losing JPMorgan Chase leases to its debuting headquarters at 270 Park Avenue\nneed not yet\nworry.\nThe bank expanded its presence at Brookfield\u2019s 5 Manhattan West by 139,000 square feet in the fourth quarter, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. The expansion, disclosed in a Colliers office report, brings JPMorgan\u2019s footprint at the Midtown West building to 565,000 square feet.\nFurther details of the deal, including the length of the expansion and the asking rent, were not reported. But the average asking rent in Midtown in the fourth quarter was $84.24 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJPMorgan also recently\nexpanded\nits footprint at L&amp;L Holding Company\u2019s 390 Madison Avenue, adding 60,000 square feet to its office there. The bank occupies nearly 500,000 square feet at that property.\nThe deals stand out when compared to the bank\u2019s recent opening of a 2.5 million-square-foot, Foster + Partners-designed tower at 270 Park Avenue. The headquarters is designed to accommodate roughly 10,000 of JPMorgan\u2019s 24,000 New York employees.\nAcross the street from there is another building the bank owns, paving the path for what has been\ndescribed\nas a JPMorgan-centric neighborhood.\nBut JPMorgan isn\u2019t ready to consolidate to one office or one area of Manhattan yet. JPMorgan is undertaking a $1 billion renovation of 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns building across the street from the headquarters it\nbought in 2008\n.\nIt also recently signed a multi-year renewal on its 270,000-square-foot lease at\n237 Park Avenue\n, a victory for co-owners RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital.\nA year ago, Amazon expanded its presence at 5 Manhattan West by 112,000 square feet through WeWork, which is operating the space on behalf of the e-commerce giant.\nOther tenants at the 16-story office building include\nweight loss startup Noom\nand Whole Foods, which leases 60,000 square feet of retail space at the property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Even as David Werner is on a dealmaking streak in the distressed office market, he and partner Joseph Mizrachi have dragged fellow investors Rubin Schron and David Lowenfeld into a $167 million alleged loan default in Chicago.\nSchron\u2019s New York-based firm\nCammeby\u2019s International\nand David Lowenfeld\u2019s New York-based World Wide Group allegedly defaulted on a commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to the ground beneath the building at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\n, according to loan servicer reports. The alleged default marks a dramatic escalation of distress at the 1.1 million-square-foot West Loop office tower, where a complex ownership structure has finally buckled.\nThe alleged ground default was triggered by the building\u2019s leasehold owners, New York-based Werner\u2019s eponymous firm and Boca Raton, Florida-based Mizrachi\u2019s Third Millennium Group. While they\u2019ve been in alleged default on their own $175 million building loan from South Korea-based Shinhan Investment Corp. since 2023, they had still been making ground lease payments to Schron and Lowenfeld. But those stopped late last year, too, as the October installment was the first payment missed, loan servicer reports show.\nBy allegedly withholding rent, the building\u2019s owners effectively pulled their ground landlords into the abyss. Schron and Lowenfeld\u2019s $167 million ground debt \u2014 originated by Morgan Stanely and split across the MSBAM 2015-C22 and MSC 2015-MS1 loan pools \u2014 was transferred to special servicer LNR Partners, a subsidiary of Starwood Property Trust, in November for \u201cimminent default,\u201d loan data shows.\nThe hammer has already dropped. Arne Shulkin\u2019s team at LNR sent a formal notice of default on Nov. 21 and officially accelerated the loan to be fully due ahead of maturity on Dec. 11, notes from the special servicer said. A local lawyer has been retained to explore foreclosure litigation and the appointment of a receiver. While LNR is \u201cdual-tracking\u201d the process by discussing workout alternatives, the move toward litigation suggests the era of extend and pretend has reached its limit.\nSo far, the path forward for the leasehold default is unclear. Shinhan didn\u2019t return a request for comment on whether it would resume ground lease payments if it seized the building from Werner and Mizrachi.\nRepresentatives of the firms led by Werner, Mizrachi, Schron and Lowenfeld also didn\u2019t return requests for comment, nor did LNR Partners.\nThis collapse highlights the inherent volatility of the bifurcated ownership model, which splits the land from the building to boost returns \u2014 a strategy long championed by players like\nJay Shidler\n, whose similar gambits have sunk multiple deals in Chicago, including at the Loop\u2019s\nBurnham Center\n.\nWhile these deals may offer upfront benefits, they often become unsellable in high interest rate environments. The strategy has also fueled recent carnage for\nShaya Prager of Opal Holdings\n. Lender GreenState Credit Union recently completed a foreclosure on Prager\u2019s suburban Chicago office campus, after his firm\u2019s default on the $104 million Deerfield property encumbered by a similar ground lease structure.\nAt the 23-story tower on 300 South Riverside, the property\u2019s fundamentals have been shredded by tenant departures. Zurich North America recently\nditched the property for the Willis Tower\n, and\nCars.com slashed its footprint\n. Now, with the ground and the building in simultaneous alleged loan defaults, the very foundation of the deal is being wiped out.\nStill, the setback at the property hasn\u2019t stopped Werner from making other plays. He and partner 601W Cos. just this week purchased the building at\n175 West Jackson Boulevard\nout of distress for $41 million. That is about 87 percent less than the $306 million prior owner Brookfield Properties spent to buy it in 2017.\nWerner also teamed up with 601W last year to buy the building at\n303 East Wacker Drive\nat a big discount from its previous purchase price.\nHe\u2019s going even bigger in New York. To close 2025, Werner struck a\n$270 million deal to buy One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza\nat 885 2nd Avenue in Midtown East, about half off its previous purchase price in 2019. And earlier in 2025,\nWerner and partner MetroLoft scored a $700 million loan\nfrom Madison Realty Capital for the office-to-residential conversion project at 235 East 42nd Street.\nWerner and 601W in November also closed a\n$165 million purchase\nof the 532,000-square-foot office building at 205 East 42nd Street in New York.\nAt the same time, Mizrachi\u2019s firm is also trying to make moves. Third Millennium last year\nrevived its effort, in partnership with Hines\n, to find an anchor tenant for an office development it wants to build in Chicago\u2019s West Loop, next to the 31-story building they constructed together at 540 West Madison Street a decade ago. The new plan would be a 28-story tower consisting of over 600,000 square feet of office space at 590 West Madison.\n",

        "content": "Brookfield is reaching into its own pocket to refinance a piece of lower Manhattan\u2019s crown jewels.\nThe Canadian investment manager is nearing an $800 million CMBS loan for 225 Liberty Street, a 44-story, 2.4 million-square-foot office tower that\u2019s part of Brookfield Place, Bisnow\nreported\n. Brookfield is contributing roughly $173 million of fresh equity to help refinance a $900 million CMBS loan that dates back to 2016 and comes due this week.\nThe financing, originated by Citi Real Estate Funding, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of Nova Scotia and Wells Fargo, carries a fixed rate of just under 5.9 percent on a five-year term, according to ratings agency KBRA. That\u2019s a notable step up from the prior loan\u2019s 4.7 percent rate, according to S&amp;P Global, reflecting the higher-cost capital environment facing even the best-in-class office assets.\nKBRA pegged the tower\u2019s latest appraised value at $1.3 billion. The building was about 90 percent leased as of November, with Brookfield Properties itself the largest tenant, occupying more than 535,000 square feet.\nOne uncertainty at the property is Saks Global, which signed a 233,000-square-foot office lease at in 2014, but filed for bankruptcy last month. Its lease runs through 2031, but the company is delinquent on rent and its space is being treated as vacant in KBRA\u2019s loan analysis.\nThe refinancing comes shortly after Brookfield\nextended its ground lease\nwith the Battery Park City Authority for the entire Brookfield Place complex through 2119. Brookfield pays the authority about $7 million a year under the lease with scheduled step-ups baked in over time.\nOriginally developed in the late 1980s as the World Financial Center by Olympia &amp; York, Brookfield Place spans 14 acres and includes office towers at 200 and 250 Vesey Street along with a vast retail concourse.\nIn a recent investor presentation, Brookfield pegged the complex as its most valuable office holding globally, valuing it at $4 billion within the firm\u2019s $1 trillion portfolio.\nBrookfield and its affiliates have remained active in the CMBS market, closing large packages last year at Five Manhattan West and 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Fresh off signing a nine-figure extension, Chicago Bulls guard Josh Giddey made his first major real estate move in the city, paying just under $4.5 million for a five-bedroom townhome in River North.\nThe deal closed in September, just three weeks after the Bulls inked Giddey to a four-year, $100 million contract and days before his 23rd birthday, according to Cook County records. Giddey bought the 7,800-square-foot townhouse at 429 West Superior Street through an opaque land trust, a common move for high-profile buyers looking to keep their names off public filings, the Chicago Tribune first\nreported\n.\nThe purchase plants the 6-foot-7 guard in Kingsbury Estates, a\nRiver North\nenclave that has long attracted pro athletes. Former\nBulls stars\nDeMar DeRozan and Jimmy Butler have lived nearby, as has ex-Bears running back Matt Forte.\nBuilt in 2007 as the former Montgomery Ward industrial site was being redeveloped, the four-story\ntownhome\nwas recently gut-renovated and listed for $4.5 million, according to the publication. It has six bathrooms, an elevator, heated floors throughout and an attached, heated 2\u00bd-car garage outfitted with a Tesla charger. A ground-floor family room doubles as a home theater, while the fourth floor opens to a lounge with a dedicated terrace.\nThe home also features a double-island white kitchen with gold accents, accordion doors opening to a pergola-covered terrace, glass-front wine storage tucked beneath the staircase and a primary suite featuring Koroseal wallpaper and Ann Sacks tile. The top floor also has a second terrace.\nThe\nsellers\n, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and his wife, bought the home for nearly $2.2 million in 2020 and completed what listing materials described as a \u201ccomplete renovation.\u201d According to the outlet, they stayed close to the home, moving down the block to a $7.2 million house they bought in June.\nThe townhouse carried a $43,597 tax bill for 2024, records show. Justin Penn of Keller Williams One Chicago, who represented Giddey, and Carrie McCormick of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who represented the sellers, declined to comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As the artificial intelligence industry booms, so does the Class A office market in the Bay Area.\nLast year, the region netted 14 of the\u00a0 100 largest\noffice leases\nin the U.S. for a total of 4.3 million square feet, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n, citing data from CBRE. AI companies and large tech employers led the pack as many firms either expanded their footprints or planted their first flags in the area.\nSan Francisco had four of the largest lease deals in the region, eight were in Silicon Valley and one each was in the East Bay and the Peninsula, up from 11 the year prior. AI firms now occupy at least 6 million square feet across Silicon Valley alone.\nNo other portion of the country has seen\nAI funding\ncome close to the Bay Area\u2019s approximately $100 billion in investment since 2020, per CBRE. Overall, the Bay Area saw a 2 percent increase in leased space, joining Manhattan at 3 percent as the only markets in the country to see notable gains in office leases.\nVacancy in the area remains high, hovering around 33 percent in San Francisco and reaching near record levels in the Peninsula. The numbers haven\u2019t scared away firms, especially large players like OpenAI and Anthropic.\nAnthropic just leased the entire 420,000-square-foot building at 300 Howard Street, adding to its 250,000 square feet nearby at\n500 Howard Street\nand\n100,000 square feet at 505 Howard\nit leased late last year. Earlier this month,\nDatabricks expanded\nits offices in Sunnyvale\u2019s Cityline development to 455,000 square feet, adding to its 305,000 square feet at an adjacent building\nleased last summer\n. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to\ngrow its San Francisco offices\nby about 250,000 square feet, taking its total office space in the city to roughly 1 million square feet.\nThe Bay Area\u2019s office leasing patterns mirror larger national trends. Last year, the largest office leases in the U.S. largely consisted of expansions rather than relocations. Demand for space was concentrated in top-tier buildings in central locations for employees. In the Peninsula, tech companies and other employers have been attracted to office buildings in walkable downtowns near Caltrain stops and other amenities.\nHigh-end buildings attracted 90 percent of leasing activity in the fourth quarter, per Colliers data cited by the Business Journal. The Bay Area at large saw a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption. With construction of new offices slowing and demand for premium buildings surging, tenants might eventually have to fight over the region\u2019s older inventory as newer offices get snapped up.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A $10.9 billion merger between Comerica and Ohio-based Fifth Third has officially closed, creating the nation\u2019s ninth-largest bank and throwing a fresh spotlight on one of downtown Dallas\u2019 most closely watched office buildings.\nThe combined company now controls $294 billion in assets and will operate under the Fifth Third corporate name, though customers won\u2019t see an immediate rebrand. CEO Tim Spence said the bank will continue doing business as both Fifth Third and Comerica until technology systems are unified,\naccording\nto an interview with The Dallas Morning News.\nThat transition period \u2014 expected to stretch through a systems conversion planned around Labor Day \u2014 means the Comerica name will stay across North Texas, including atop the 60-story Comerica Bank Tower downtown at 1717 Main Street and at Globe Life Field in Arlington.\n\u201cOur intent today is to do the systems conversions over Labor Day weekend,\u201d Spence told the paper, adding that the bank wants to avoid confusing customers in Comerica markets by switching names too quickly.\nThe pause offers at least temporary certainty for the downtown skyscraper. The tower\u2019s naming rights are tied to Comerica\u2019s lease, which runs through 2028 and covers about 200,000 square feet of the building\u2019s roughly 1.5 million square feet. Spence told the outlet that about 350 employees work out of the tower, though Downtown Dallas Incorporated pegs the number north of 1,000.\nThe building\u2019s future has drawn outsized attention as downtown grapples with office vacancies, quality-of-life concerns and the\nlooming departure of AT&amp;T\nfrom its longtime headquarters. The Comerica tower was\nsold\nin 2024 to Toronto-based\nSlate Asset Management\nand is managed by Stream Realty, which has\nfloated\na major redevelopment that would add hotel and residential components.\nSpence signaled no immediate shake-up. Asked whether Fifth Third might break the lease or exit early, he said there are \u201cno firm plans on that front,\u201d though he acknowledged discussions with the landlord about redevelopment scenarios.\n\u201cThe landlord may have a lot of different plans,\u201d Spence said. \u201cWe have to have a dialogue with them about what their vision is.\u201d\nBeyond downtown,\nComerica\nalso operates a Business and Innovation Hub at Frisco\u2019s Star Tower, announced in 2022. The hub employs about 350 people, though that figure may shift after a previously disclosed round of 184 layoffs set to take effect in March.\n\u201cWe like having a city center presence,\u201d Spence said. \u201cSo we do expect to have multiple office locations.\u201d\nDallas-Fort Worth will remain one of five major employment hubs for the merged bank, he said, even as the company works to streamline and reduce redundancies across the merged banks.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Before Steve Ross set his sights on a 1980s waterfront condo in West Palm Beach, Joey Columbo was picking up units in the building with the foresight that a developer would soon come knocking on doors with a buyout offer.\nColumbo, a Palm Beach-based investor and broker, identified Southbridge Condominium, a three-story complex at 3915 South Flagler Drive, as a future teardown redevelopment site along West Palm Beach\u2019s coast. Between 2021 and 2023, he acquired eight units for a combined $1.6 million, records show. During the same period, he joined four other partners to buy 19 more units for a combined $4.2 million.\nFour years later, Columbo is walking away with a hefty payday after selling his eight units for a combined $6.4 million, and the joint venture selling its 19 condos for a combined $19 million to\nRelated Ross\n, records show. Since 2024, Ross\u2019 firm has acquired 45 of the 63 condos at Southbridge with the most recent round netting 27 units at an average price of nearly $941,000 per unit for a combined\n$25.4 million\n.\nDevelopers like Ross are paying large premiums to avoid the years\u2011long grind he went through, Columbo said.\n\u201cThese big developers are ponying up so much because they don\u2019t have the risk appetite or the patience to do what I did, slowly buying them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just offering massive numbers. They\u2019re paying for the premium of not having to wait, and having it done in one fell swoop.\u201d\nSpotting Southbridge before the rush\nColumbo said he zeroed in on Southbridge in 2021, shortly before the collapse of\nChamplain Towers South\nin Surfside triggered a wave of government reforms forcing condo associations to fix older buildings with expensive special assessments. At the same time, deep-pocketed developers are pursuing bulk condo terminations to acquire potential redevelopment sites.\n\u201cI was driving over the bridge one day, and I was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s the perfect place for a [high-rise] condo,\u2019\u201d Columbo said. \u201cAnd this was pre\u2011Surfside collapse. Condo buyouts weren\u2019t as prevalent as I think they are today.\u201d\nHe paid an average of $202,000 per unit as he quietly amassed condos at Southbridge over a two year period, records show.\n\u201cI found a unit on the market, and I bought it,\u201d Columbo said. \u201cAnd then over the next two years, I ended up with 42 percent of the condominium.\u201d\nCompleted in 1981, Southbridge sits directly on the Intracoastal, near\nMar\u2011a\u2011Lago\n, President Donald Trump\u2019s private club and home. Turning Southbridge into a bulk play meant working multiple purchases spread over months while dealing with a condo board wary of a takeover, Columbo said.\n\u201cIt was a slow and difficult process because I was picking off one unit owner at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 30\u2011something individual negotiations and deals over the span of two years.\u201d\nPrices kept rising as word spread that someone was trying to corner the building, he said.\n\u201cEvery deal was challenging from the standpoint that these units weren\u2019t on the market, so it was going up in price,\u201d Columbo said. \u201cOnce the board started getting wind of it, obviously they didn\u2019t like it, and they tried to stop it through lots of arbitration.\u201d\nRoss steps in \u2014 and pays up\nAs Columbo built his position, he envisioned that he and his partners could redevelop Southbridge themselves.\n\u201cI actually brought in my partners with the hopes of it being a Four Seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw the site, and they loved it.\u201d\nBut then\nRoss\nbought 10 units in the complex in 2024.\nThat meant his joint venture could not move forward with its redevelopment dream, Columbo said. Now, Ross controls the majority of Southbridge, having spent roughly $37 million for 45 units, or about $844,000 per unit on average, according to real estate database Vizzda and other published reports.\nColumbo sold his eight solely-owned units to the Ross affiliate at $800,000 apiece, more than triple his average basis. The joint venture sold its units at $1 million each.\nRoss\nhas emerged as one of the dominant players in West Palm Beach, with a portfolio of office, residential and mixed\u2011use projects along the downtown and waterfront corridors.\u00a0 Ross has not publicly disclosed plans for the Southbridge site, though market observers expect a redevelopment to target the upper tier of the luxury market, given the prices paid per unit and the land\u2019s waterfront positioning.\nSouthbridge sits just outside the urban core in what Columbo calls an increasingly coveted stretch of South Flagler Drive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the new gold coast of West Palm. The views are amazing,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "A century-old movie palace in Highland Park will avoid permanent closure thanks to Hollywood actor Kristen Stewart.\nThe \u201cTwilight\u201d star and native Angeleno purchased the Highland Theatre at 5604 North Figueroa Street for an undisclosed amount,\nArchitectural Digest\nand the\nLos Angeles Times\nreported. The movie house went dark in 2024 and faced permanent closure before Stewart stepped in.\nThe venue will need a lot of love before it can reopen to moviegoers. The three-story building has a partially intact mezzanine and stage, but significant renovation and rehabilitation efforts will be needed to bring it back to its former glory.\n\u201cThere are so many beautiful details that need to be restored,\u201d Stewart told Architectural Digest. \u201cI think there\u2019s a way to bring the building back to life in a way that embraces its history but also brings something new to the neighborhood and something new to the whole L.A. film community. That\u2019s the point \u2014 new ideas.\u201d\nArchitect Lewis Arthur Smith, known for envisioning other local theaters like the Vista Theatre in\nLos Feliz\nand the El Portal Theatre in\nNorth Hollywood\n, designed the Highland Theatre. Coincidentally, another actor-turned-director, Quentin Tarantino,\npurchased the Vista in 2021\nand reopened it two years later, while a group of filmmakers led by director Jason Reitman acquired the nearly 100-year-old\nVillage Theatre in Westwood\nin 2024.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was looking for a theater until this place came to my attention. Then it was like a gunshot went off and the race was on. I ran toward it with everything I had,\u201d Stewart told Architectural Digest, saying she\u2019s \u201cfascinated by broken-down old theaters\u201d and \u201calways want[s] to see what mysteries they hold.\u201d\nStewart moved to buy the theater after seeing local theaters in her home city being replaced with retail stores. The actor is hopeful for the future of art in an entertainment industry increasingly dominated by reboots, revivals and the rising presence of artificial intelligence. \u201cWhen people are desperate, they start doing desperate things,\u201d Stewart\nsaid\n. \u201cI think buying this theater feels a little desperate in, like, the most beautiful way.\u201d\nThe actor\u2019s restoration endeavor is \u201cnot just for pretentious Hollywood cinephiles,\u201d she added. \u201cI see it as an antidote to all the corporate bullsh*t, a place that takes movie culture away from just buying and selling. I think there\u2019s a huge desire and craving for what this kind of space can offer.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Horton project in Bonham brings North Texas residential development a step closer to\nOklahoma\n.\nThe Arlington, Texas-based homebuilding giant will start construction this month on Asher Oaks, a 78-lot community on 27 acres in Bonham, according to a press release from the Bonham Economic Development Corporation. Bonham is a Fannin County town about 30 miles east of\nSherman\n\u2014 Texas\u2019 northernmost city linked directly to downtown Dallas via highway \u2014 and 40 miles northeast of McKinney, the nearest Metroplex commuter hub.\nUnlike other recently announced master-planned communities replacing farmland throughout North Texas, including Sanchez &amp; Associates\u2019\nPowder Creek Ranch\nproject outside Bonham, Asher Oaks will be centrally located. The 27-acre site, a former golf course, is across the street from Bonham High School.\nAmong four master-planned communities in the pipeline for Bonham, Asher Oaks will be the first to start construction, according to City Manager Sean Pate. Sanchez plans to build 3,000 homes, including multifamily units, in Powder Creek Ranch near State Highways 121 and 56. Last April, the city approved a public improvement district for The Preserve at Bonham, a 200-acre mixed-use development off U.S. 82 where Fieldside Development plans to build 1,000 single-family homes. And Rockhill Capital and Investments is planning a 600-acre development with multifamily units, single-family homes and condominiums near Bois D\u2019Arc Lake, one of two newly completed reservoirs.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have a\nwater crisis\n. We\u2019ve got that taken care of,\u201d Pate said.\nAsher Oaks isn\u2019t expected to have a multifamily component, but two commercial lots are waiting for development, according to the release. Asher Lane Bridal already operates on another commercial lot.\nAsher Oaks isn\u2019t D.R. Horton\u2019s northernmost development in Texas, but it\u2019s close. It\u2019s just south of U.S. 82, the highway that generally hugs the Texas-Oklahoma border. Sweetwater Springs near Sherman is the company\u2019s only Texas community north of U.S. 82, according to\nBuilder Guides\n.\nD.R. Horton did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first of many for D.R. Horton,\u201d Pate said.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has signed off on more than $40 million in loans for affordable housing developments across the county.\nOverall, the county has approved nearly $43.8 million for affordable housing projects in the cities of Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Whittier, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The $43.8 million provides a fraction of capital stacks that combine for $562 million. When finished, the developments would provide 687 affordable units for seniors, families and homeless individuals.\nNew High Village, a proposed development at a county-owned parking lot at 725 North Spring Street in\nChinatown\n, will receive nearly $14 million for two residential components. The county will provide $7.2 million for a 158-unit senior apartment complex, which is expected to cost $101 million total, and $6.6 million for a 146-unit family apartment complex, believed to cost about $142 million. New High Village will also boast 14,000 square feet of commercial space and a public plaza.\nIn the unincorporated community of Windsor Hills, PATH Ventures is slated to receive $10 million for a new supportive housing complex on a vacant lot at 4615 Slauson Avenue. The proposed PATH Villas Windsor Hills building would rise six stories with 122 studio and one-bedroom apartments above a parking garage. Total development cost is estimated at $87 million.\nNear the beach in Venice, Hollywood Community Housing and Venice Community Housing\u2019s Venice Dell project will receive $3 million from L.A. County; that\u2019s on top of the more than\n$42 million that the state has already committed\nto the development. Venice Dell will consist of low-rise buildings containing 120 apartments and ground-floor retail on a parking lot at Venice Boulevard and Pacific Avenue.\nIn West Hollywood, developer\nCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica\nwill get $3.6 million for the redevelopment of a property owned by the city of West Hollywood at 1047-1057 North Crescent Heights Boulevard. The effort, expected to cost $34.3 million in total, would result in a five-story building with 40 studio and one-bedroom units for senior residents. The county is also providing\nLinc Housing\nwith $4.3 million for a new supportive housing complex at 1238 Larrabee Street in West Hollywood. Those plans call for 49 units with an overall estimated cost of $32 million.\nIn the eastern Los Angeles County municipality of\u00a0 Whittier,\nNational CORE\nand Prima Development will benefit from $9 million in county funds for its Telegraph Apartments project, helping with the $33.9 million projected budget. The developers are planning for 51 apartments for large families at 14250 Telegraph Road.\nThe latest funding comes after the California Strategic Growth Council\napproved $866 million\nin grant funding for affordable housing across the state late last year. More than $182 million of that will go to four projects efforts in Los Angeles County,\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Rexford\u2019s incoming chief executive and current chief operating officer Laura Clark used the occasion of the industrial investor\u2019s quarterly earnings call to discuss plans to dispose of $400 million to $500 million worth of assets this year.\nRexford\nreported\na loss of about $69 million during the fourth quarter, compared to an income of $59 million for the same period a year earlier, in its first earnings since it announced plans for a CEO\nsuccession\nin the wake of activist investor Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management becoming one of its largest shareholders. According to Rexford, $89 million of impairments related to developments it elected to sell and $60 million of co-CEO transition costs were to blame. The losses were slightly offset by $20 million of gains on sales of real estate.\nRexford has identified six development projects totaling about 850,000 square feet that the company is no longer moving forward with. Rexford has either accepted offers or is under contract to sell the properties, Clark said\nThat goes hand-in-hand with a post-Elliott initiative calling for the company to maximize returns by selling assets and reinvesting capital into share repurchases \u2014 a repeat of a strategy it engaged last year as Elliott circled. That was a departure from buy-happy days, as Rexford peddled seven properties for a total of $217.5 million \u2014 and repurchased more than 6 million shares of common stock for a total of $250 million.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust ended the year with a 90 percent occupied portfolio after executing 10 million square feet of new and renewal leases but saw its rents decline 1 percent quarter-over-quarter and 20 percent since a peak reached early 2023, in the current, softer Southern California industrial sector.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2025, net income was $200 million compared to $263 million the year before.",

        "content": "Roblox Corporation is growing in Silicon Valley.\nThe video game company has signed on to pre-lease two forthcoming office buildings at the 80-acre Bay Meadows campus in San Mateo, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nRoblox committed to more than 325,000 square feet in two mid-rise buildings that have been approved for construction and are expected to be completed by 2029, sources familiar with the deal told the Business Times. The lease ranks among the largest office deals in the Peninsula since the pandemic.\nRoblox has established its global headquarters at Bay Meadows, now occupying or committing to more than 1 million square feet at the campus. Artificial intelligence startup\nSkild began subleasing\n32,500 square feet of Roblox\u2019s former digs at 970 Park Place in San Mateo last year.\nThe gaming giant has been growing its headcount in recent years, adding employees at a roughly 15 percent rate annually since the pandemic. Once the new pre-leased buildings at Bay Meadows are complete, the company will have enough space to accommodate 6,000 employees in a walkable hub near housing, retail and the San Mateo\nCaltrain stop\n.\nThe Peninsula is becoming a hotspot for office users looking for premium space outside San Francisco. Approximately 90 percent of leasing in the area last quarter was in high-end buildings filled with amenities, per Colliers data cited by the Business Times. The region saw a second consecutive quarter of positive absorption, with net occupancy gains of 17,674 square feet.\nIn Burlingame, Upstart Holdings leased roughly 54,000 square feet at the newly built 220 Park office building near the\nBurlingame Caltrain station\n. Law firm Paul Hastings is planning a similar move into a modern, transit-adjacent home in 45,000 square feet in downtown Redwood City. Databricks just\nleased additional offices\nat Sunnyvale\u2019s new Cityline development, bringing its total presence there to 455,000 square feet across two towers.\nDemand for older buildings, on the other hand, is falling behind. Some buildings are slated for housing conversions, including GoPro\u2019s former corporate campus in San Mateo. Harvest Properties and Stockbridge Capital Group\nacquired the six-building complex\nlast fall for $102 million with plans to build a 225-unit for-sale residential community.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Mayweather rented the five-bedroom, five-bathroom apartment that spans the property\u2019s 18th and 19th floors in December 2024.\nMayweather stopped paying rent in July and eventually owed upwards of $500,000 in back rent and other damages, but the owners negotiated a settlement with Mayweather for him to repay the rent and other debt by Dec. 2, 2025, the suit claims.\nInstead, Mayweather only paid one of the five months, according to Pulse International Realty\u2019s Rena Kliot, an agent who will be re-listing the unit in the spring.\n\u201cHe had this post he put up on Instagram with stacks of money in front of him, and they sent it to me and said, \u2018well how about using some of that money to pay us,\u2019\u201d Kliot told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe owners put some of Mayweather\u2019s security deposit towards the allegedly unpaid rent, according to Kliot.\nA representative for Mayweather did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKliot said she plans to list the home for sale, somewhere between $22 and $24 million, or for rent at $150,000 per month.\nMayweather, who was undefeated in his pro career and made over $1 billion in winnings, has turned to real estate investment for a second career and embarked on a shopping spree in recent years.\nMayweather purchased a minority interest in Black Spruce portfolio last year for\n$402 million\n, with an option to buy outright many of the 62 buildings in the portfolio.\nHe launched a real estate firm in 2024, when he put\n$100 million in equity towards a joint venture\nwith Go Partners on a luxury rental portfolio valued at $3 billion.\nBut reporting by\nBusiness Insider\nhas raised questions about Mayweather\u2019s financial stability. The publication pointed to foreclosures on commercial properties owned by Mayweather and lawsuits claiming he failed to pay for millions of dollars of luxury items.\nMayweather\u2019s lawyer, Bobby Samini, previously denied the outlet\u2019s reporting, saying he was not \u201cexperiencing financial strain.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The city is spending $38.4 million to put heat pumps in the 712 units at the Housing Authority\u2019s Beach 41st Street Houses.\nNo need to get your calculators out. I got you. That\u2019s $54,000 per unit.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani shared the first two numbers, but not the third one, on Wednesday in Far Rockaway as he proudly announced the expenditure. \u201cThe need for this infrastructure is urgent,\u201d he said.\nMamdani said when he represented Queensbridge Houses in the Assembly, its residents would tell him \u201cof a heating system that was so unreliable that they would have to regulate the heat themselves, opening up windows, no matter what the temperature was, to try and create some level of stability.\u201d\nA much greater problem is when the heat doesn\u2019t work at all, which happens quite a bit at NYCHA developments.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons that the Housing Authority is both loved and loathed \u2014 often by the exact same people.\nSocialists and NYCHA tenants love the idea of publicly owned, operated and subsidized housing but loathe the terrible condition into which the government has let its developments fall. Many see no connection between these two facts.\nPrivate landlords loathe that NYCHA gets away with a lot of stuff that they cannot.\n\u201cAlthough HPD does cite the housing authority for violations, it does not enforce collection of fines. As a result, a NYCHA property can get hit with dozens of citations and pay\nno penalty at all\n,\u201d Greg Smith wrote in The City in August 2023, eight months after a new law was supposed to start holding NYCHA to the same standard as private owners.\nBut these same landlords love having NYCHA as an example of what they say would happen to their buildings if the government took them over. They loved that NYCHA was No. 1 on the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list, until Public Advocate Jumaane Williams took it off the list entirely, perhaps to avoid embarrassing the Mamdani administration.\nPrivate housing providers also love bringing up NYCHA\u2019s spending to show that the government is being disingenuous when it says rent-stabilized owners should be able to renovate units for $15,000 or\n$30,000\nor even\n$50,000\n.\nThose amounts come from actual laws and government programs \u2014\nindividual apartment improvements\nand\nUnlocking Doors\n. Meanwhile, NYCHA spends well over $400,000 to fully renovate one of its units.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDoes Gary Segal and Brad Zackson\u2019s\nDynamic Star\nhave any hope of finishing its massive Fordham Landing project?\nThe eight-year-old firm was hit with a\nforeclosure suit\nin October and sought\nbankruptcy protection\nin December for itself and the entities with equity stakes in the development. Last year, after the state kicked in $55 million in infrastructure work, Zackson claimed to be on track to deliver 900 affordable units in 2026.\nThe second phase of the project, which doesn\u2019t even have zoning approvals, calls for 1.8 million square feet of mixed-income housing, 744,000 square feet of office and 143,000 square feet of retail. The firm is looking for new investors. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Bill Weidner, who runs a\nLocal Law 152\ninspection business with his brother, a master plumber, also has a real estate podcast called Realty Speak. I joined Ann Korchak of the Small Property Owners of New York as a guest on the\nlatest episode\nto talk about rent-stabilized housing and other New York real estate topics. It\u2019s also on\nSpotify\nand\nApple Podcasts\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nMy colleague Liz Cryan reported that Related Companies CEO\nJeff Blau\nsaid a new city law requiring bird-friendly glass added $2 million to the cost of a city-funded affordable housing project. Blau\u2019s point seemed to be that the city was working at cross-purposes.\nAnother question is whether that $2 million could have saved more birds if spent some other way. Cats kill an estimated\nfour times more birds\nthan windows do (see the chart below from New Hampshire Audubon). Perhaps spending $2 million to neuter 15,000 cats would be better for birds.\nThat math is not going to persuade any volunteer who partakes in the heartbreaking task of collecting dead birds from sidewalks beside glass buildings.\nPoliticians also have a hard time putting efficiency before emotion. I have yet to hear one suggest that the billions of dollars spent on sidewalk sheds to comply with the city\u2019s draconian facade statute could be used to save more lives than\nLocal Law 11\ndoes.\nNo elected official wants to be blamed for the death of another\nGrace Gold\n, even if the alternative is 10 deaths \u2014 blamed on someone else.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$19 million\nfor a 6,850-square-foot house at 78 Morton Street in the West Village. Jeremy V. Stein and Kat Trappe of Sotheby\u2019s had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$30 million\nfor 12,552 square feet of vacant commercial land at 539 West 54th Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$13.5 million\nfor a 4,678-square-foot condominium unit at 158 Mercer Street in Soho. Jim St. Andr\u00e9, Trevor Stephens and Michael Maniawski of Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 52,660-square-foot, eight-story, 60-unit project at 3070 Williamsbridge Road in the Bronx. Panagis Georgopoulos filed the permit on behalf of Floriand Lulaj.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

In the same meeting, the city approved an agreement with other Greene entities to support the improvement of Currie Park, the 13-acre park adjacent to many of the West Palm Beach properties Greene owns and plans to develop.\nConstruction started on One West Palm in 2019, with the expectation that it would be completed in 2022. Greene purchased the 3.3-acre development site for $10 million in 2014, according to property records.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the towers are set to include 326 apartments, 201 hotel rooms, 200,000 square feet of office space, and amenities like a fitness club, spa, movie theater, pools and indoor tennis courts.\nBut construction was mired in squabbles with the city and legal fights with the contractor from early stages. In 2020, Greene\nthreatened to halt construction entirely\nif West Palm Beach didn\u2019t grant him a requested zoning change.\nThe agreement between Greene and the city to finish One West Palm puts a wrap on a legal spat that started in the fall. Greene\nsued West Palm Beach in October\n, alleging the city was improperly stalling approvals for a separate condominium project, a pair of Herzog &amp; de Mueron-designed buildings slated for his 4.5-acre site at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive.\nNow he\u2019s agreed to a land swap and to pay $6 million for the city to connect Northwood Road to Currie Park. With the dust settling, he can move forward with the Herzog &amp; de Mueron condos, which still need final approvals, he said.\n\u201cOnce we have those done and we get approved, then we\u2019ll be in a position to start marketing these condos,\u201d he said. But, \u201cThat\u2019s probably six months away until we can open a sales office.\u201d",

        "content": "Acre won approval for an apartment complex adjacent to a 48-acre waterfront park in Miami, agreeing to create public parking and offering a $1 million mitigation payment to the office of a Miami City Commission member.\nThe 337-unit project, called Adela II, would rise at 645 Northeast 64th Street, just south of Legion Park and west of Acre\u2019s 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay apartment complex.\nThe project has financing in place, including a loan from Canyon and equity from Acre\u2019s Fund VI, said Jesse Kehoe, Acre\u2019s director of development in Miami.\nThe project is awaiting permits after Miami\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board this week approved a zoning request allowing Acre to build the complex as a single 530,000-square-foot development across the 17-lot assemblage. The previous zoning allowed for 700,000 square feet.\nThe firm expects to start construction in two or three months, Kehoe said.\nAt least 20 workforce housing units are part of the plan, as well as 5,000 square feet of retail, a public paseo and a 502-space parking garage to include 76 spaces for public use.\nAcre will give Miami City Commission Commission Chairwoman Christine King\u2019s office $1 million for use within her district, Acre\u2019s attorney Nicholas Rodriguez-Caballero said. King\u2019s district includes Legion Park and the Upper Eastside neighborhoods north of it as well as Overtown, Wynwood, Little Haiti and Liberty City.\nAcre still needs the Miami City Commission to deed NE 64\nth\nTerrace to Acre, since the road runs through the development site. The street will be reworked as a two-way entrance for the parking garage.\nThe market-rate units will charge roughly the same rents as Adela at MiMo Bay, Kehoe said. That complex, at 6445 Northeast 7th Avenue, was\ncompleted in 2020\nand was\nrefinanced for $72 million\nlast year. Apartments there rent from $2,500 to almost $5,000 a month, according to its website.\nAcre, co-led by Miami-based managing partner Michael Van Der Poel, persuaded the city in 2024\nto rezone\nthe bulk of the 3.25-acre assemblage for buildings up to eight stories high, despite fierce opposition from neighbors. That rezoning capped development rights at 337 apartments and forbade future owners from using the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\nto increase density.",

The two-story building is leased to\nOffice Depot\nand A+ MIni Storage. The price amounts to $4.1 million per acre.\nThe South Florida self-storage market is experiencing a slowdown in rent growth and an oversupply of storage units, according to Yardi Matrix. Meanwhile, strip malls and outdoor shopping centers are the most sought-after retail real estate assets in South Florida.\nThe seller, an entity managed by A+ Mini principal\nRaul Nu\u00f1ez\n, paid $3.9 million for the 5.6-acre site in 2001, records show. The buildings were completed in 1978 and 2008.\nVolta Global has developed or acquired 4.2 million square feet of self-storage,\nmultifamily\n, and hospitality properties in the U.S. and Europe since its founding in 2014, according to the firm\u2019s website. It owns 1 million square feet of self-storage space in the southeastern U.S.\nDimitrijevic did not respond to a request for comment.\nHis Swiss-based global investment fund Everest Capital collapsed the same year he established Volta Global, after betting heavily that the Swiss Franc would fall in value against the Euro between 2014 and 2015, published reports state. However, in 2015, the Swiss National Bank announced it was lifting its caps on Euro exchanges, and the Swiss Franc shot up by more than 30 percent.\nEverest closed within days, and investors lost a majority of their investments, according to a 2020 settlement with the SEC. Regulators determined that Everest was over-exposed in the euro investment, yet Everest assured investors that their funds were safe, the settlement states.\nWithout admitting or denying the findings, Everest and Dimitrijevic agreed to be censured, to cease-and-desist from making misleading statements, pay a penalty of $750,000, forfeit $2 million in profits and pay $458,000 in interest, according to the SEC.\n",

        "content": "Rick Caruso\njust walked back into the political conversation in Los Angeles.\nThe billionaire developer, less than a month after\nannouncing\nhe would not enter L.A.\u2019s mayoral or California\u2019s gubernatorial races, is rethinking that decision. Caruso offered that up in an interview with\nKNX News\non Wednesday after the Los Angeles Times published a report alleging Mayor\nKaren Bass\nrequested certain information be removed or \u201csoftened\u201d in the Palisades Fire after-action report. The story cited two anonymous sources.\nCaruso said he needs time \u201cto process\u201d the story but told KNX he\u2019s \u201cworried about the city.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time to decide, obviously, because we\u2019ve got a looming deadline this Saturday,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be meeting and talking to the family and we\u2019ll see, you know, what we decide to do.\u201d\nSaturday is the deadline for mayoral hopefuls to file formal paperwork declaring their run for office.\nThis reverses course from the announcement Caruso made last month in which he underscored the significance of the private sector in serving communities and said that would continue to be his focus rather than elected office. Should Caruso change his mind, it sets the stage for a rematch between himself and Bass after the two ran against one another for the mayor\u2019s seat in 2022.\nIt would also shake up a mayoral race that just saw Austin Beutner, a former L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, drop out of the race on Thursday. That leaves a\nlandscape\nof mostly longshot candidates that include civil engineer Asaad Alnajjar, Democratic Socialists of America member\nRae Chen Huang\n, former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nand more than 20 other hopefuls.\nA spokesperson for Caruso did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nBass\u2019s office called the Times report \u201cmuckraking journalism at its lowest form,\u201d in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cThe mayor has been clear about her concerns regarding pre-deployment and the [Los Angeles Fire Department\u2019s] response to the fire, which is why there is new leadership at LAFD and why she called for an independent review of the Lachman Fire mop-up,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason why she would request those details be altered or erased when she herself has been critical of the response to the fire \u2014 full stop. She has said this for months.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to address Caruso\u2019s comments on what he finds problematic with the city and its leadership.\nWhile Caruso shied away from explicitly saying whether Bass should resign based on the claims of the Times story, he clearly thinks the city is lacking on a few fronts.\nHe pointed to potholes on the street, dirty sidewalks, public safety concerns and Downtown Los Angeles\u2019s unfinished residential and retail project Oceanwide Plaza. The $1.2 billion mixed-use development is known as the graffiti towers after Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding to continue construction and the towers became marred with graffiti.\nLast week,\nBloomberg\nreported a deal may be in the works with a buyer. Still, after years sitting in its current state, Caruso likened the towers to a beacon to the world \u201cthat this city is somehow in crisis.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have leadership that somehow feels that corruption and doing bad things is OK, and we need to hold people accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just shouldn\u2019t be allowing our leadership to be doing the kind of things that, frankly, embarrass the city and don\u2019t represent the greatness and goodness of the city or the people of the city.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate pros are banking on a new Cook County Assessor taking office, after spending years\nlamenting changes\nto the local property tax system.\nTop real estate developers like Magellan Development CEO David Carlins, CRG CEO Shawn Clark and Riverside Investment and Development CEO John O\u2019Donnell have all made five-figure donations to Patrick Hynes\u2019 campaign to oust incumbent Assessor Fritz Kaegi in the March 17 Democratic primary, public records show. Carlins has given at least $40,000, while O\u2019Donnell and entities with ties to his firm Riverside have donated a total of $30,000, records show.\nHynes, who has served as the tax assessor for the southwest suburban Lyons Township since 2021 and worked in the Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office for two decades prior, has so far courted donations from leading Chicago real estate professionals as well as construction labor unions.\n\u201cFor too long, Fritz Kaegi\u2019s unpredictable and volatile property tax assessments have left Cook County working families struggling to pay the bills,\u201d an endorsement from the Chicago Federation of Labor read. \u201cPat will put the Assessor\u2019s Office back on track, giving Cook County\u2019s working class the certainty of rational and predictable assessments.\u201d\nSo far, Hynes has collected at least $235,000 from real estate-related figures, making up about 22 percent of his total donations, an analysis of public campaign finance data from\nThe Real Deal\nfound. Multifamily investor Stuart Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management, Related Midwest executive Don Biernacki, former Cinespace owner turned real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nand developer Warren Baker all chipped in for Hynes, as well.\nKaegi, who was elected in 2019, has become politically vulnerable over the last few years. Commercial real estate players have slammed his approach to re-assessing property values in the wake of the pandemic.\n\u201cThe fact that the assessments of office buildings are continuing to increase with no acknowledgment of the impact of the pandemic doesn\u2019t seem objective. It\u2019s not consistent with what\u2019s happening in other markets or what\u2019s happening in our market,\u201d Farzin Parang, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, said when the latest downtown assessments were released in November.\nKaegi was also subject to an investigation led by the Chicago Tribune and the Illinois Answers Project that found he missed\n$444 million in increases to taxable value\namong properties in Cook County that had recently been renovated.\nAnd during the current assessment cycle, he took heat for sending tax bills out\nfour months later than usual\ndue to technical issues, though his office wasn\u2019t solely to blame.\nIn July, the Cook County Democratic Primary\nendorsed Hynes over Kaegi\n.\nStill, Kaegi came in as a reform candidate after associates of the prior assessor, Joseph Berrios, were\ncaught up in corruption scandals\nthat led to multiple members of his office facing criminal charges.\n\u201cHe is a fair and honest person and we need more of that,\u201d said Kim Krerbis, a Chicago-based residential real estate agent with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate who donated to Kaegi\u2019s campaign.\nThe campaign put out a press release criticizing Hynes for accepting over 100 political donations from property tax attorneys, calling the support \u201ca massive conflict of interest,\u201d and Kaegi seeks to distance himself from developers.\n\u201cWhen big commercial properties get tax cuts they don\u2019t deserve, homeowners pay for it. It\u2019s a blatant conflict of interest that the Cook County Inspector General has been sounding the alarm on for years,\u201d Kaegi told\nTRD\n. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019ve never taken a dime from property tax appeal attorneys and never will.\u201d\nKaegi\u2019s campaign finances found attorneys listed who work at law firms that offer property tax services but the individual donors appeared to specialize in other areas, a\nTRD\nanalysis of public records found. Since the last election cycle, Kaegi has accepted about $400,000 in donations from real estate-related figures, making up about 6 percent of his total donations, public records show.\nKrebis said she sees Kaegi\u2019s reform efforts as attempts to level the playing field between major corporate landlords and developers and the average homeowner.\n\u201cIf you are a wealthy person on the North Side, I can see how you would not want Kaegi to continue,\u201d Krebis said. \u201cHe has reviewed the city as a whole and seen that people on the South Side are being over-assessed.\u201d\nThe local union representing government workers, The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, is also backing Kaegi.\n\u201cOur union endorsed Assessor Kaegi for reelection because he has championed important reforms to how assessments are made in Cook County \u2014 making the system fairer for working families \u2014 and because he respects the expertise and dedication of the union members who work in the assessor\u2019s office,\u201d said Anders Lindall, AFSCME Council 31\u2019s Director of Public Affairs.\nBut a long list of construction-related unions have donated to Hynes\u2019 campaign, including local chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Chicago Federation of Labor, Plumbers Local and the Chicagoland Associated General Contractors, among others.\nRepresentatives of the construction unions that donated to Hynes didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nDevelopers in the city often blame fluctuations in property tax assessments for the\ncity\u2019s historic drought in multifamily construction\nand a growing list of\nstalled megaprojects\n.\nShortly after taking office in 2019, Kaegi was tasked with re-assessing commercial properties in the wake of the pandemic. As commercial properties lose value, the county\u2019s tax burden gets shifted onto residential property owners.\nMeanwhile, residential property owners in lower-income areas of the county have still been hit with major increases in property values, and thus their share of the county\u2019s tax bill. West Garfield Park experienced\nthe steepest increases\nin the most recent cycle, with median homeowner bills up nearly $2,000, or 133 percent. Kaegi has attributed such patterns to the\nCook County Board of Review\u2019s willingness to slash property values\nfor commercial landlords who file appeals of their assessments.\nIn response, Hynes\u2019 campaign has stressed that as assessor, his role would be to attract more business and development to the city to expand its tax base and spread the burden across more taxpayers. If elected, he plans to establish a Department of Economic Development within the Assessor\u2019s Office.\nSo far, it appears that business leaders have taken notice of Hynes\u2019 approach. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Restaurateurs Association both made donations to his campaign.\nNot everyone in the industry has been convinced yet. Longtime real estate investor Bob Wislow\u2019s firm Parkside Realty, as well as JDL Development\u2019s Jim Letchinger, who is taking on the Lincoln Yards turnaround project renamed as Foundry Park, have each donated to Kaegi\u2019s campaign instead of Hynes. So did Chicago-based real estate investment firm JRG Capital Partners. Letchinger and representatives of Parkside and JRG didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nEarly voting in the primary began Feb. 5. Whoever wins the Democratic primary is heavily favored to win the general election in November against the only other candidate in the race, Libertarian Nico Tsatsoulis.\n",

        "content": "Dan McCaffery\u2019s redevelopment pitch for the former Mars Wrigley candy factory on Chicago\u2019s Far Northwest Side is running into resistance, as neighbors question whether another large housing project is what the area needs.\nHis Chicago-based firm McCaffery Interests proposed redeveloping the 20-acre former Mars plant at 2019 North Oak Park Avenue with close to 500 residential units,\naccording\nto FOX 32 Chicago. The plan would include a mix of senior housing, townhomes and apartments, at a site that for nearly a century anchored the\nGalewood\nneighborhood with industrial jobs.\nThe factory, which produced Snickers, Milky Way and 3 Musketeers bars, shut down in 2024 after about 95 years in operation. Chicago-based McCaffery was\nselected as developer\nshortly after the closure. While the Spanish Revival-style administrative building along Oak Park Avenue has landmark status and will be preserved, the rest of the campus is up for redevelopment.\nMcCaffery\noutlined its concept during three community meetings in December, but some residents said the proposal leans too heavily toward housing in an area already seeing a wave of residential development.\n\u201cWe have developments at Sears, we have developments at U.S. Bank, and now we have this development,\u201d Michael Nardello, vice president of the Galewood Montclare Community Organization, told FOX Chicago.\nHe was referring to the major overhauls that included some combination of multi-story rental apartments and retail, including at the former Sears location at the northeast corner of North and Harlem avenues, and the former U.S Bank site at 6700 West North Avenue. Those projects attracted more opposition than support from residents, who were pushing for single-family homes or condominiums, arguing that apartments could harm the neighborhood\u2019s quality of life.\n\u201cThe community is kind of concerned about the impact with density, safety, the streets, the parking,\u201d Nardello said.\nThe community group is calling for a local referendum, as well as traffic and parking studies, before the McCaffery proposal moves forward. Residents said they want investment that brings services and amenities, not just rooftops\nResident Thomas Simmons told the TV station that a library or a youth center that could provide recreational or apprenticeship programs is a higher priority for the neighborhood than more housing.\nAlderman\nChristopher Taliaferro\n, who represents the 29th Ward, said the proposal is far from finalized. In a statement, he noted that McCaffery\u2019s concept followed earlier community meetings \u2014 some held years ago \u2014 that generated ideas ranging from light manufacturing and green space to retail and mixed-use development.\nGiven recent changes in the neighborhood, Taliaferro said more discussions are needed, particularly around the residential component. He stopped short of endorsing the plan, saying continued community engagement will determine whether it ultimately earns his support.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Santa Clara County judge has put the kibosh on a lawsuit by the town of\nLos Gatos\nall because of a simple three-letter word.\nSanta Clara County Superior Court Judge Helen E. Williams dismissed a lawsuit from the town that aimed to clarify the state\u2019s housing law and potential application of builder\u2019s remedy in the Bay Area enclave, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit centered around the meaning of the word \u201cthe\u201d in a certain portion of the Permit Streamlining Act, which dictates rules for the approval process for housing developments across the state. The town of Los Gatos interpreted the law to mean that developers only get one 90-day resubmittal period to fix incomplete applications. The\nCalifornia Department\nof Housing and Community Development said the opposite, stating developers can have an indefinite number of 90-day periods to resubmit amended applications.\nLos Gatos\nfiled the lawsuit last April\nagainst Arya Properties LLC, the developer behind the Arya, Luxe and Vista Capri projects. The developments were proposed under\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n, which allows developers to construct buildings of any desired height and size in cities that don\u2019t have a state-certified housing element. Los Gatos filed the suit after the town deemed the developer\u2019s Arya and Luxe preliminary applications were incomplete after two resubmittals.\nThe judge sided with the state\u2019s view. The judge said the town of Los Gatos interpreted the law based on the phrase \u201cthe 90-day period,\u201d where \u201cthe\u201d meant the resubmittal period itself was a one-off. Williams ruled that \u201cthe\u201d is written in the law to reduce repetition and ensure coherence in the legislation without limiting the number of 90-day periods allowed. The law also suggests that \u201cmultiple resubmissions in response to succeeding incompleteness determinations may be made without a preliminary application expiring,\u201d she said.\nFollowing the judge\u2019s ruling, the town vowed to continue processing Arya Properties LLC\u2019s applications and committed to complying with state housing requirements, saying it has approved or is processing applications for developments that would make up more than 80 percent of the units called for in the town\u2019s Regional Housing Needs Allocation.\n\u201cWe respect the court\u2019s role in interpreting state law and appreciate the clarity provided by this order,\u201d Mayor Rob Moore in a statement. \u201cWe will carefully review the decision with our legal counsel and continue to fulfill our responsibilities to the community to provide affordable housing and implement the Housing Element.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Rex Glendenning is dreaming up thousands of homes along Interstate 35 in North Texas near the small town of Gainesville, just shy of the Oklahoma border.\nGlendenning\nand his wife, Sherese, closed last Friday on Pace Ranch, an 815-acre tract in Cooke County, through their entity Old Chisholm Trail Partners. The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat the terms of the deal were not disclosed. The property, which stretches along I-35, had been marketed to multiple buyers before the Glendennings struck a deal with the Pace family, which owned the land for more than 75 years.\nThe site sits about 70 miles north of Downtown Dallas and roughly 65 miles from Downtown Fort Worth \u2014 territory that until recently sat beyond the immediate reach of large-scale suburban development, according to the publication.\nGlendenning envisions a\nmixed-use project\nthat could bring thousands of residential units as well as sizable industry to the area. Early concepts call for the northern 400 acres to be developed with housing, while portions of the southern acreage could be carved out for logistics or industrial uses.\nPlans are still being made, but Glendenning told the outlet that the site could support between 800 and 1,000 single-family homes, along with 2,000 to 3,000 apartments. Talks are also underway with grocery operators.\n\u201cThe I-35 corridor is experiencing significant growth in the logistics sector from the Fort Worth Alliance area through Denton and Sanger,\u201d Glendenning told the outlet. \u201cWe feel the Gainesville area is next in line for the right development and project. I\u2019d rather be early to the party than late.\u201d\nCaleb Lavey of Glendenning\u2019s Frisco-based firm Rex Real Estate handled negotiations on the transaction.\nGlendenning\u2019s newly acquired land sits just north of a proposed 1,000-acre BNSF Railway logistics park planned between Sanger and Valley View, and just last week H-E-B closed on roughly 600 acres in Cooke County also near Valley View, about 60 miles north of Fort Worth and 17 miles from Denton.\nRex Real Estate is focused on land along the region\u2019s fast-growing \u201cGolden Corridor\u201d near the Dallas North Tollway and Preston Road. Glendenning\u2019s resume includes working with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on a logistics land assembly in Sanger, where Blue Star Land and Crossland Development pieced together about 278 acres along I-35 in 2021.\nGlenndenning also announced in September that he plans to move Rex Real Estate out of Frisco and back to\nCelina\n, closer to some of the brokerage\u2019s newest projects. Glendenning is eyeing a\nmass timber office building\nof 40,000 to 60,000 square feet for the new headquarters. He hopes to start construction in the fall. Celina is about 40 miles north of Downtown Dallas and has a population of about 30,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Fort Worth-based Bennett Partners is serving as architect, and Hasen Holdings is the project\u2019s general contractor.\nThe building, constructed in 1952 as the headquarters of Fort Worth National Bank, was designated a historic landmark in 2024. Its mid-century exterior \u2014 with a slab-and-tower design and rust-colored brick \u2014 will be preserved, Slezak said, even as the interior is fully rebuilt.\nPlans call for a mix of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, along with amenities including a rooftop deck and fitness center. The ground floor will retain restaurant space, including Little Red Wasp and Capital Grille. The building sits within walking distance of the Trinity Railway Express station and the emerging Texas A&amp;M\u2013Fort Worth campus.\nPublic incentives are part of the capital stack. Board members overseeing a\ntax-increment financing zone\nalong the Lancaster corridor approved $4 million in infrastructure reimbursements for the project, according to the publication. In exchange, 20 percent of the units will be offered at below-market rents for at least 10 years.\nHasen Holdings President David Hasenzahl said the former Oncor building is unusually well-suited for a residential conversion, particularly on floors five through 16, due to the design of the building\u2019s exterior perimeter walls and windows.\nThe project marks 3L Real Estate\u2019s 13th acquisition overall and its second in North Texas. The firm is also working with Hasen on another office-to-apartment conversion at\n501 Elm Street\nin downtown Dallas.\nSlezak said the timing aligns with broader investment flowing into Fort Worth\u2019s urban core, including the $700 million overhaul of the Fort Worth Convention Center and the Texas A&amp;M campus now under construction.\nOther downtown Fort Worth buildings slated for residential conversions include the Binyon-O\u2019Keefe Building at 210 East Seventh Street and\n811 Calhoun Street\n, which is planned as a 100-unit senior housing project.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Griffin Capital\n\u2019s latest refinancing shows what it takes to get a cash infusion in\nAustin\u2019s sluggish multifamily market\n.\nThe Los Angeles-based investor landed a $47 million loan for an apartment complex it completed in 2024 near the Domain. The loan will be used to refinance 1900 Parmer, a 364-unit apartment complex at 1900 East Parmer Lane, according to a release from Berkadia. Hancock Whitney Bank provided a $34.3 million construction loan for the property in 2020, according to loan documents.\nBerkadia\u2019s Mitch Sinberg, Scott Wadler, Brad Williamson, Matt Robbins and Patrick Johnson arranged the deal. The refinancing, which was provided by Boston-based MF1 Capital, works out to $129,000 per unit. The property was last valued at $65.5 million, appraisal district records show.\nThe apartment complex was 98 percent occupied when the loan closed, according to Berkadia. It offers studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, plus amenities like a pool, gym, dog park and clubhouse.\nAustin\u2019s multifamily market tanked\nafter a glut of new apartments were built at the same time, causing rents and occupancy to drop. As a result, it\u2019s tougher to get fresh financing for local projects, but 1900 Parmer has the dual benefit of being a new property in a high-growth area.\nThe property is in north Austin about six miles from the Domain, the city\u2019s premier office destination. As tech companies reverse the trend of gobbling up\nAustin office space\n, the Domain has persisted as a strong office submarket. In 2025, the area netted one-third of the space among\nthe city\u2019s largest office leases\n.\nGriffin developed 1900 Parmer as part of its first Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund. The firm has since launched additional\nOpportunity Zone\nfunds, raising a total of $2 billion in equity. The funds manage a portfolio of 32 properties in various stages of development across the Sun Belt.\n",

The buyers took out $53.1 million in loans for the purchase, consisting of a $28.6 million Freddie Mac senior debt and a $24.5 million subordinate loan from an entity tied to Spira.\nCompleted in 1989 on a nearly 20-acre site, Falls of Bonaventure consists of a pair of five-story apartment buildings and a one-story clubhouse.\nThe selling entity ties to Fairview, New Jersey-based low-income housing developer\nRoizman Development\n, which paid $9.8 million for the property in 1993, according to records. The selling entity also ties to New York-based Related Companies and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group, records show.\nThe two Related companies previously were partners, with their founders starting to invest together in South Florida real estate in the 1970s. Related Companies was founded by Steve Ross, who in 2024 stepped back from the firm to start and lead West Palm Beach-based\nRelated Ross\n, which is exclusively focused on South Florida. Related Group\u2019s founder is Jorge P\u00e9rez, who still leads the firm with his sons, Jon Paul P\u00e9rez and Nicholas P\u00e9rez.\nOver the years, Ross\u2019 stake in Related Group waned, and in 2022, he publicly stated\n\u201cjust kind of split recently, very amicably,\n\u201d referring to Related Group. The firms are major investors and developers in South Florida, where both started out as affordable housing developers.\nFoundation For Affordable Housing, co-founded by Tom and Deborrah Willard, and led by Darrin Willard, has a portfolio of over 300 properties nationwide with nearly 38,000 units, according to its website. It\u2019s been a sporadic investor in South Florida low- and moderate-income housing.\nIn 2024, Foundation For Affordable Housing sold the 172-unit Woodsdale Oaks apartment complex at 2543-2595 Northwest 49th Avenue in Lauderdale Lakes for\n$20 million\nto Spira Equity. The firm also sold the 123-unit senior independent living Federation Plaza building at 3081 Taft Street in Hollywood for\n$29.7 million\n. Related Companies was the buyer.\nSpira, led by managing partners Stephen Ho and Robert Lee, is an affordable housing investment firm with a portfolio of $700 million in assets owned, spanning more than 3,300 units, according to its website.\nAffordable housing apartment complexes are a coveted asset among investors in South Florida, largely due to pent up\ndemand\nfueled by the region\u2019s ever-increasing cost of living and lagging incomes.\nIn 2024, New York-based Fairstead bought the 177-unit affordable housing complex at 3144-3146 Northwest 19th Street in Lauderhill for\n$26.5 million\n, at the time starting renovations.\n",

        "content": "A\nBeverly Hills\nestate fit for a Hollywood star is hitting the market.\nA compound built for Hollywood Golden Age actor James Cagney is being offered for $38.5 million, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The estate spans about 5 acres in the ritzy Los Angeles-area enclave and has a nearly century-long history.\nCagney built the stone villa around 1939 and owned the home until his death in 1986. The following year, his widow Frances Cagney sold the property to its current owner Steven Dunn, founder of baby product company Munchkin.\nThough Cagney lived in his Beverly Hills abode while filming movies like \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy,\u201d he spent his off time at his farms in upstate New York and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, according to the Journal. While one might expect a star to live in a luxurious estate, the property under Cagney\u2019s ownership was relatively humble, save for a studio with a wooden floor and record player where he practiced dancing.\nWhen the Beverly Hills property came under Dunn\u2019s watch, the entrepreneur expanded the home to approximately 6,000 square feet with three bedrooms. In the 1990s, Dunn purchased an adjacent parcel and combined the properties into one 5-acre compound. Besides the main house, the property also has a 2,500-square-foot guest house, a pool, a pool cabana with an outdoor kitchen, and tennis and pickleball courts.\nDunn also owns a property next door that isn\u2019t for sale. The owner is selling because he is \u201cready for a change,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\nof Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, who is marketing the property, told the Journal. Dunn and his ex-wife Laura listed another Beverly Hills estate in 2019 for $72 million; that property is now owned by Laura Dunn.\nDespite\nMeasure ULA\nimposing transfer taxes on all sales above $5 million and a\nlooming billionaire tax\nthat voters could approve in November, the\nluxury market in Los Angeles\nis seeing interest tick up. \u201cWe have a lot more buyers looking at properties across all price points,\u201d Kirman said. \u201cThere\u2019s pent-up demand and not a lot of inventory.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The bank bought the 200,000-square-foot property for $45.1 million, or approximately $225 per square foot.\nAPF had been in danger of losing the property for months.

It was appraised last year at $55 million, below the $75 million in debt attached to the property.\nBeyond 25 West 45th Street, Stefan Soloviev\u2019s firm\npaid more than $67 million\nlast year to buy the site at 24 West 57th Street from APF The property sits next to an assemblage pieced together by Soloviev\u2019s late father, Sheldon Solow.\nGary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development had previously acquired a $50 million defaulted loan on APF Properties\u2019 block-through plot of land at the site.\nSoloviev chief executive officer Michael Hershman recently\ntipped off\nthat the firm was looking for an anchor tenant for an office development, which could span more than 900,000 square feet, according to the executive.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Doris Tan, who was previously on Alexander\u2019s team remains, with Hilton Hilton as one of three agents \u2014 the others being Conrad Hilton and Jack Shulruff \u2014 at the brokerage led by chair Rick Hilton.\nAlexander\u2019s exit follows the September departure of Hilton Hilton co-founders and co-CEOs\nBarron N. Hilton and his wife Tessa Hilton\n, who struck a deal with Compass to bring their business to the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills and Palm Beach offices. The couple said in a joint statement to\nThe Real Deal\nat the time that their departure from Hilton Hilton was a \u201cstrategic move\u201d for themselves and clients \u201cfor long-term success in an increasingly competitive market.\u201d\nAlexander\u2019s move ends his long run working with Rick, who co-founded\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nwith the late Jeff Hyland.\n\u201cWith over 12 years working alongside Rick Hilton and Jeff Hyland, I\u2019m deeply grateful for our long history together,\u201d Alexander said in a statement.\nDespite that history, Alexander said The Agency\u2019s Aspen office makes sense as he and his family spend more time in Colorado. Meanwhile, The Agency\u2019s Beverly Hills office allows him and his team to continue their work locally, particularly given the $1.8 billion netted in career sales.\n\u27a4 Jon Grauman and Adam Rosenfeld\u2019s Side-backed brokerage\nResident Group\nbrought on Kevin Stewart from their former firm, The Agency, to serve as a partner. It\u2019s the first major announcement out of the former \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d stars\u2019 Resident since the brokerage launched in June 2025.\nStewart brings more than $500 million in volume with his move to Resident and also comes full circle with his change of scenery. He previously worked with Grauman and Rosenfeld when the two ran the Grauman Rosenfeld Group at The Agency.\n\u27a4 Assisting those who lost their homes from the Palisades Fire to find temporary housing, navigate insurance or plan rebuilding became the basis for Danny Brown and Jenifer Porter starting Porter &amp; Brown Real Estate Advisory Group at\nCompass\n. The two, who are joined by Porter\u2019s son, Oliver Porter, are based out of the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills office and offer real estate, design and development services.\nThe launch of Porter &amp; Brown follows over two decades selling homes for Brown, who can count over 450 closings and more than $150 million in inventory both on- and off-market.\nJenifer brings to the newly launched advisory her expertise as an interior designer with A-list client work in her portfolio. That includes 2571 Wallingford Drive, the $60.9 million mansion purchased in 2023 by Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s home at 1707 Westridge Drive in Brentwood, which he purchased in 2024 for about $40 million.\n\u27a4 Elsewhere at Compass, the brokerage recruited Monica Antola from Rodeo Realty. Antola had more than $21 million in sales last year and focuses on Pacific Palisades and other L.A. coastal markets.\nAntola\u2019s joined by Angel Collins and Ann Marie Ahern, who also moved their business from Rodeo Realty to Compass. The duo, who brought their seven-person team, are based out of Sherman Oaks.\nThere\u2019s also former Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers agents Reza Badakshan and Naomi Kalkanoff, who closed over $25 million in deals last year.\nMeanwhile, Ben Bellet, who is making the move from a focus on the Westside to Westlake Village, hung his license with Compass Beverly Hills.

The deals for the properties are complete, but the sale price of both could not immediately be discerned.\nWhile the properties feature the same seller, they do not feature the same buyer. Lodging investor Gencom is picking up the 253-key Manhattan building, while Trinity Investments is acquiring the 300-key building in the nation\u2019s capital.\nWestbrook did not respond to a request for comment, while Trinity declined to comment. The founder of Gencom, meanwhile, released a statement highlighting \u201ccompelling long-term opportunities\u201d in the Big Apple.\nSuch opportunities exist in the luxury hotel market across the country. Last year, revenue per available room across luxury chains rose 5.1 percent, according to CoStar. For the entire hotel industry in the nation, there was a decline last year in the industry standard metric.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a sector Westbrook is increasingly looking to exit. In November, Blackstone agreed to buy the 277-key Four Seasons hotel at 757 Market Street in San Francisco for about\n$130 million\n, or $469,300 per key.\nThe transaction represents Blackstone\u2019s first hotel purchase in San Francisco in about a decade. The price is notably under the $181.6 million that Westbrook was asking when\nit listed the property\n.\nGencom is on the other side of the spectrum.\nA group of investors, including Highgate, Gencom and Argent Ventures, purchased the 36-story, 607-room InterContinental New York Times Square for\napproximately $230 million\nat the tail end of last year.\nThe property was sold by a joint venture of Tishman Realty and Metlife Investment Management and the purchase was financed by a $190 million loan from Monroe Capital.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Veteran Chicago hospitality investor\nJohn Rutledge\nlooks on track to hand over another hotel to his lender after pulling some cash out through a refinancing.\nAn affiliate of Rutledge\u2019s firm Oxford Capital and foreign investors who put nearly $24 million into his 221-room Godfrey Hotel hotel deal in the River North neighborhood are at risk of losing the property to New York-based lender Quadrum Global.\nA foreclosure complaint filed Tuesday in the Circuit Court of Cook County reveals that Quadrum, the hotel\u2019s senior lender, has moved to seize the property at 127 West Huron Street. The legal action follows a depletion of the hotel\u2019s financial runway, marking a downturn for a property that a little more than two years ago was celebrated as a successfully refinanced asset in a difficult Chicago hotel market.\nThe litigation stems from a \u201ccascading default\u201d that accelerated in the final weeks of 2025. According to court documents, the Oxford ownership entity was bound by a loan agreement requiring a minimum interest reserve account of $2.5 million if the property\u2019s debt service coverage ratio fell below certain thresholds.\nWhen the reserve dipped below $1 million in December, the lender issued a formal \u201cReplenishment Notice.\u201d By the middle of last month, the reserve had hit $0, and a debt service payment of more than $572,000 went partially unpaid, leaving a delinquent balance of $124,160, Quadrum\u2019s lawsuit said. This breach allowed the lender to accelerate the entire $63 million primary debt, effectively ending the owner\u2019s control of the cash flow and moving the property toward a judicial sale.\nBut there\u2019s a twist with the ownership: an arm of Quadrum that\u2019s separate from the senior lender entity is also a joint venture investor alongside Rutledge in the property\u2019s equity, as Quadrum is at several other Oxford-operated hotels in Chicago.\nOxford and Quadrum completed development of the Godfrey in 2014. The property\u2019s original developer began construction before the Great Recession on what was meant to be a Staybridge Suites extended stay hotel, but the project stalled with the economic crash and the developer was ultimately hit with a foreclosure lawsuit. Oxford bought the defaulted construction loan and took control of the property in 2012, redesigning and rebranding it as the Godfrey.\nQuadrum\u2019s lending arm refinanced the property with a $63 million loan in 2023, replacing a previous debt of a little more than $47 million and likely allowing the landlords to pocket some of the excess proceeds.\nBut now, there\u2019s $57 million that remains due on the senior loan while there\u2019s a group of foreign investors who chipped $23.5 million into the property through the EB-5 visa program who stand to be wiped out.\nThe\nEB-5 program\nis a federal initiative that allows foreign nationals to obtain U.S. permanent residency \u2014 green cards \u2014 in exchange for investing substantial sums into a project that creates full-time jobs for American workers. For developers like Oxford, this capital is often attractive because it is significantly cheaper than standard mezzanine debt or equity.\nHowever, the Godfrey investors now face the harsh reality of subordination, with the Quadrum senior lender set to be repaid first by any sale or refinancing that occurs. It\u2019s unclear what the Godfrey property is worth today, but nearby North Side hotel sales have been trading at notable discounts from their previous purchase prices, in some cases impairing loans, including at a\nGold Coast hotel that sold for $13 million\nlast month.\nThe senior lender offered the EB-5 group a ten-day window in January to cure the default by paying the $124,000 delinquency and replenishing the $2.5 million reserve themselves to protect their position. The filing of the lawsuit this week indicates that the investors were either unable or unwilling to throw more capital into the project \u2014 they\u2019ve collected interest on their loan for years, however, since at least 2017.\nDespite the legal fire, Rutledge\u2019s Oxford is signaling this may not be a hostile foreclosure. The firm has a history of deeds in lieu of foreclosure, where properties are handed back to lenders amicably to settle debts, and Oxford\u2019s hospitality management arm has stayed on to operate the hotel. In 2024,\nOxford handed four San Francisco hotels back to its lenders\nunder similar market pressures, but remained the operator of the properties.\nEchoes of South Loop Distress\nThe Godfrey\u2019s troubles mirror a larger wave of EB-5 related litigation currently roiling the Chicago lodging industry.\nHotelier\nSu-Mei Yen\nis currently facing an even larger $187 million foreclosure in the South Loop initiated by lender ACORE, as well as three separate lawsuits brought by EB-5 investors who loaned nearly $50 million to the hotel project led by Yen and her daughter, Cassie Yen, including one filed last month.\nThey allege a \u201cscheme\u201d in which the Yens controlled both the borrower and the EB-5 lender entities, creating an inherent conflict of interest.\nWhile one case involving the South Loop property was recently ordered to arbitration, it is scheduled to return to court for a status update this spring, while two others are still in the early stages of litigation in Cook County court.\n",

        "content": "A University of Illinois-led research hub is poised to become the latest buyer of a distressed\nLoop\noffice building, striking a deal to acquire a 16-story building along the Chicago River for roughly $25 million.\nDiscovery Partners Institute is under contract to buy the 1950s-era property at 250 South Wacker Drive from UBS, according to people familiar with the deal and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The agreement comes years after the seller, then Credit Suisse, paid about $90 million for the 259,400-square-foot building in 2011. UBS, which absorbed Credit Suisse in its 2024 rescue merger, is represented by CBRE broker David Knapp. The bank declined to comment.\nThe building is largely empty after Molson Coors Brewing Company agreed to\nrelocate\nits Americas headquarters from most of the property \u2014 a 167,000-square-foot space \u2014 in 2023 to the newly-built BMO Tower across the river. That move left 250 South Wacker Drive struggling to fill space, according to the publication. If the deal closes, it would add to a growing list of\nChicago office\nbuildings trading at deep discounts, particularly those built decades ago and saddled with vacancies.\nWhat Discovery Partners Institute plans to do with the building remains unclear. The institute currently leases space next door at\n200 South Wacker Drive\nand has been searching for a permanent home since its launch. The University of Illinois System confirmed that its board authorized moving forward with a building purchase but declined to share details while the transaction is pending.\nDiscovery Partners focuses on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. For years, the institute was slated to anchor a domed facility within Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre The 78 megadevelopment, according to the CoStar, but that vision unraveled late last year, when Governor JB Pritzker and state officials announced the institute would no longer move forward at the site, which is also slated for a new Chicago Fire soccer stadium.\nInstead, state leaders have pointed to a sprawling quantum computing campus rising on the former U.S. Steel South Works site as the institute\u2019s long-term ecosystem. Construction there is already underway, with tenants like Israel-based Quantum Machines signing on.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Machine Investment Group and building operator Centurion Real Estate Partners are searching for buyers to purchase unsold units at the site.\nThe market appears ripe for buying, Josh Tashjian, managing partner with Centurion Real Estate Partners, told the Mercury News. San Jose is \u201cunderserved by housing\u201d and simultaneously faces \u201csignificant housing demand and great purchasing power.\u201d\nMachine Investment Group acquired the two residential towers from\nZ&amp;L Properties\nin a fast-tracked foreclosure proceeding\nlast June for $181.9 million\n. Machine Investment obtained a $215 million loan from an affiliate of New York-based Benefit Street Partners for the acquisition. Z&amp;L, which\nowned and developed the properties\n, defaulted on a $330 million loan from a Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies affiliate, leading lenders to pursue an expedited deed-in-lieu of foreclosure process.\nAfter Machine Investment acquired the towers, the company vowed to breathe new life into the buildings. The firm is investing $30 million to renovate and upgrade the towers, common areas and amenities ahead of the condo sales. Machine is looking to redesign the lobbies and build out a club on the third floor complete with private workspaces, social lounges, a catering kitchen, an outdoor terrace, a 75-foot pool, a hot tub and barbecue areas.\nAs of Wednesday, 202 of the 303 units in the western tower were unsold, and all 337 units in the eastern tower were not spoken for.

        "content": "The lender behind one of downtown Dallas\u2019 most ambitious redevelopments\ntook back the keys\n.\nStarwood Property Trust acquired The National, a 52-story mixed-use skyscraper at 1401 Elm Street redeveloped by Shawn Todd\u2019s Todd Interests, after a foreclosure auction Tuesday on the steps of the George Allen Courts Building.\nThe Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat ownership reverted to the Starwood Capital Group affiliate at a listed purchase price of $207 million, with existing debt used to buy the property.\nThe loss comes amid a torrent of\nbad news for Downtown Dallas\n, which is set to lose office tenant AT&amp;T when it\nrelocates to Plano\n.\nThe foreclosure of The National wasn\u2019t a surprise. Todd told the publication last month that he owed Starwood roughly $230 million and would not contest the proceedings. Starwood filed for foreclosure in early January.\nTodd pointed to the same pressures hitting downtown office and mixed-use assets across the country: high interest rates, falling property values and thinning occupancy. Apartment occupancy at The National had dipped below 80 percent, Todd said, and refinancing talks with\nStarwood\nfailed to produce a viable path forward.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication at the time, calling it the first time in 35 years that his firm\nlost money\n.\nThat loss is a steep reversal for a project once held up as a model for large-scale urban reuse. Todd Interests poured more than $460 million into redeveloping the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower, which sat empty for a decade before its transformation. The 1.5 million-square-foot midcentury skyscraper was converted into a mix of apartments, hotel rooms, offices, retail and restaurants.\nWhen the deal was unveiled in 2019, Todd described it as the largest historic tax credit transaction in Texas. The project relied on about $100 million in historic tax credits and $50 million in\nDallas\ntax increment financing to pencil out. Designed by prominent Dallas architects George Dahl and Thomas Stanley, the 1965 tower had been the largest vacant building in North Texas when it closed in 2010.\nWhat comes next for The National is an open question. All six restaurants, including Italian steakhouse and seafood hotspot Monarch, are expected to remain open, according to prior reporting.\nThe foreclosure lands amid a broader reshuffling for Todd Interests. Just months ago, the firm sold its entire stake in the 20-acre\nEast Quarter\ndevelopment to partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management for an undisclosed price. Along with The National, Todd Interests has been behind several marquee redevelopments, including the $300 million overhaul of Energy Plaza into the Sinclair.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Earlier this week, Shopoff Realty\nacquired\nthe remaining components of the mall site after spending the past four years assembling parcels of property there.\nPlans for Bolsa Pacific call for 2,250 residential units in a combination of for-sale homes and rental units \u2014 some market-rate and some affordable; about 220,000 square feet of retail; a 120-room hotel; and 15 acres of parks and public open spaces.

Demolition of the Westminster Mall is slated to start this year with construction of the new development expected to begin late this year. A Target will continue to operate at the site.\nShopoff began its acquisition of the Westminster Mall site in summer 2022 with 26 acres of land formerly home to a Sears and a Macy\u2019s. The Irvine-based real estate firm had previously announced plans for a smaller mixed-use project on that section of the mall site; that\nproposal called for\n1,065 residential units, 102 townhomes, a 175-room hotel, 25,000 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants and a 2.5-acre park.\nThe reimagining of the Westminster Mall is one of several large mixed-use developments planned to replace aging shopping centers in Orange County.\nLast September, the Santa Ana City Council\nvoted unanimously\nto approve a development agreement for C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons\u2019\nThe Village Santa Ana\n, which will rise at the South Coast Plaza retail complex site in Santa Ana.

        "content": "After hanging on through recovery from the Great Financial Crisis and at least partway through the post-pandemic market,\nNew York Life\nis ready to face the music in Schaumburg.\nThe insurance giant has officially hit the market with the Woodfield Corporate Center, a two-building, 711,000-square-foot suburban Chicago office complex that has sat on its balance sheet for nearly two decades. The move signals a major capitulation by one of the market\u2019s most patient institutional players, putting an end in sight to a difficult era for property.\nFor New York Life, the exit has been seventeen years in the making. The firm\u2019s involvement dates back to the 2007 market peak, when it provided a $70 million loan for the 12-acre campus at 425 and 475 North Martingale Road. That bet soured as the subprime mortgage crisis ballooned and shook the entire financial system when it popped.\nIn 2011, the lender officially took the keys from a joint venture of General Electric\u2019s investment arm and Lincoln Property Company via foreclosure.\nSince, the asset has been held as real estate-owned by New York Life. While the firm saw some leasing success in the years following the takeover, reaching over 80 percent occupied at some points, the post-pandemic office environment has made the long-term hold increasingly difficult to justify.\nThe offering is being led by a Colliers team consisting of the recently recruited\nDan Deuter\n, formerly of Cushman &amp; Wakefield; as well as Thomas Denison, Valerie Cook and Lizzie Apgar. Colliers teams are also assigned to Woodfield Corporate Center\u2019s leasing and property management, while a Colliers debt and structured finance team of Ben Greazel, Joel Simmons and Adam Levinson are on the investment sale listing, too.\nNew York Life didn\u2019t return a request for comment and the listing team declined comment.\nThe insurer is likely in a position to rid the asset off its balance sheet and absorb a loss. While there\u2019s no asking price on the listing, the seller likely could have generated a much larger offer, maybe well beyond than the original $70 million loan amount, in the years leading up to the pandemic, but New York Life opted to hang on.\nHolding turned out to be the wrong move, as the suburban office market is facing a brutal post-pandemic reckoning. Institutional owners are increasingly being shaken out by the combination of high interest rates and cratering demand for traditional suburban campuses. Office vacancy was at a\nrecord high of nearly 33 percent\nin the Chicago suburbs as of last quarter.\nAnd foreclosures abound, setting up more potential opportunities for discounted offices in the northwest suburbs.\nFor instance,\nZack Markwell\n, the CEO of Atlanta-based real estate firm Stonemont Financial Group, owns a large portfolio of commercial real estate in the Chicago area encompassing a handful of major office properties, including the two-building former Motorola campus in Schaumburg, that were pulled into a $664M foreclosure lawsuit last year to settle the unpaid balance of a nearly $1 billion loan issued right before the pandemic.\nSuch opportunities in Chicago\u2019s suburbs are providing buyers such as\nAlfred Teo\n\u2014 who bought the Schaumburg Towers property in 2024 out of an $84 million foreclosure lawsuit \u2014 chances to reset the values of troubled office properties by buying cheap and investing in upgrades to help them stand out to tenants in the hybrid work era of limited demand for commercial real estate.\n",

The debt is a Freddie Mac-backed loan for the two-building, 360-unit complex at 300-310 Prospect Avenue.\nA CBRE team including Judah Hammer, Jason Gaccione and Shawn Rosenthal arranged the financing.\nIn a statement, Khosla CEO Raman Khosla said the financing \u201cpositions us to continue investing in the property and enhancing the resident experience, while ensuring long-term financial stability for the asset.\u201d\nProspect Place is split between two buildings. An 18-story building contains 157 units, while a smaller five-story building has the other 203 units. Amenities at the complex include an outdoor pool, a fitness center, a clubhouse, a resident lounge, a business center, a courtyard and a billiards room.\nKhosla acquired the property from Kushner Companies in April 2021 for $114.5 million following a renovation of the complex\u2019s units and amenity spaces.\nHackensack saw a development boom in the years immediately following the pandemic. The downtown area of the municipality, known as \u201cThe Sack,\u201d saw a notable influx with more than two dozen projects springing up.\nOne development plan\nemerged\nin 2024 for a 2.7-acre site that could contain as many as 350 units.

        "content": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement closed on a warehouse in San Antonio and is reportedly exploring the purchase of another warehouse in North Texas, signaling a potential expansion of federal detention capacity even as local officials and lawmakers push back and key details remain under wraps.\nICE confirmed the purchase Thursday morning in a statement to the San Antonio Business Journal, saying it had acquired a warehouse intended for use as a detention facility, the publication\nreported\n. The agency declined to identify the property or provide transaction details, only stating that the buildings would meet federal detention standards.\n\u201cThese will not be warehouses \u2014 they will be very well-structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,\u201d ICE spokesperson Nina Pruneda said in an emailed statement. She pointed to new funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law last summer, that allows the Department of Homeland Security to\nexpand its detention presence\nnationwide.\nThe confirmation comes as real estate and political scrutiny intensifies around\nOakmont 410\n, a nearly 640,000-square-foot industrial building on San Antonio\u2019s East Side that sources claim is the likely target. Multiple real estate industry sources told the outlet that ICE was eyeing the vacant property at 542 Southeast Loop 410, a warehouse built in 2022 and marketed for lease ever since.\nThe building is owned by Oakmont Industrial Group and represented by Partners Real Estate brokers John Colglazier, John Simons and Kyle Kennan. Neither Oakmont nor Partners has commented, and as of press time no sale had been recorded in Bexar County property records.\nOpposition to the rumored deal has been swift. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert, whose district includes the site, blasted the potential use as \u201cthe most disreputable commercial activity since WWII,\u201d an apparent reference to the use of internment camps established\u00a0 to detain Japanese-Americans on the federal government\u2019s claim of \u201cmilitary necessity\u201d in the 1940s. Democratic Congressmen Greg Casar and Joaquin Castro echoed that sentiment in a joint statement earlier this week, vowing to fight any expansion of ICE\u2019s presence in San Antonio.\nThe San Antonio purchase also fueled anxiety farther north, where questions persist about a\nmassive warehouse\nnear Interstate 45 in Hutchins, a small city south of Dallas. Residents there have speculated the property could become a large detention center, though city officials said they have received no confirmation from\nfederal authorities\n.\nD Magazine first reported that the proposed ICE detention center is most likely a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 950 North I-45 next to the Hutchins State Jail, with a capacity for up to 9,500 people. The property, valued at $80.1 million and listed by Majestic Realty, is believed by local clergy members to have been purchased by ICE, though the agency has not confirmed the transaction.\nHutchins City Council convened a special meeting Wednesday night, entering executive session with legal counsel to discuss the property. The closed-door discussion ended without a vote or formal action. City leaders later said they were still unaware of any deed transfer or official plans tied to the site.\nThe property is a top taxpayer, and raised concerns about the city\u2019s ability to service debt and the lack of water/sewer capacity to support a population increase, as federal ownership would effectively end the property taxes on the building.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "BDT &amp; MSD Partners\u2019 proposal for an eight-story condominium and a three-story fitness center on the grounds of The Boca Raton won endorsement from Boca Raton\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board this week.\nThe development will replace the luxury resort\u2019s golf maintenance facility with a 76-unit multifamily highrise and a 31,700-square-foot fitness center on the 140-acre property.\nThe board unanimously recommended approval of zoning changes and master plan amendments, and the Boca Raton City Council will have final say on the proposed zoning changes.\nFormerly known as the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club, and referred to by locals at The Boca Resort, The Boca Raton at 501 East Camino Real is a 100-year-old resort and private club with more than 1,000 hotel rooms, two golf courses, a beach club, a 32-slip marina, 200,000 square feet of meeting space, tennis and pickleball courts and more than a dozen restaurants and bars.\nIts owner, New York-based merchant bank\nBDT &amp; MSD Partners\n, has invested at least $75 million renovating and improving the resort. It is an active financier in South Florida, but this is its first major development in the region.\nThe proposed residential building is slated to be 100-feet tall and span 505,800 square feet. Units will average 2,500 square feet, said Jim Tilson, CEO of New York-based architecture and planning firm Hart Howerton Partners. Five-bedroom units will span 5,000 square feet, and penthouses will include outdoor spaces, Tilson said.\nConstruction will take up to three years once permits are obtained, said Bonnie Miskal, an attorney for The Boca Raton.\nThe 52-foot-tall fitness center will be three times the size of the existing one, Miskal said.\nThe city approved plans in December for a new 19,300-square-foot maintenance facility with three levels of parking built above it.\nMSD Partners, an investment firm that was started by Dell Computers founder Michael Dell, paid\n$875 million\nfor the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club in 2019. Two years later, MSD Partners renamed it The Boca Raton. It came under the ownership of BDT &amp; MSD in 2023 when MSD merged with BDT &amp; Company.\nBoca Raton has attracted attention from developers in recent years as more affluent households move into the surrounding area.\nJust a mile away from The Boca Raton, Key International and Wexford Real Estate Investors are planning to build\nMr. C Residences Boca Raton\n, a proposed 12-story condo tower at 41 Southeast 4\nth\nStreet where sales for the project\u2019s 133 residences start at $1.7 million. And David Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group plan to include 182 condo units as part of its 1.1-million-square-foot One Boca project\nif it gets approved in a referendum in March\n.",

        "content": "Eric Ruderman and Stacey Empson helped a long-empty lakefront parcel in Evanston\u2019s Lakeshore Historic District find its footing after a decade sitting empty through a previous failed plan.\nThe longtime residents of the suburb just north of Chicago paid $2.35 million for the site in 2020 and embarked on a $7.5 million effort to build a custom home nearby Northwestern University\u2019s main campus.\nThe lot on Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline sat vacant for more than a decade in the\nChicago suburb\nprior to their purchase, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Three years after they bought the land, the couple moved into a 9,500-square-foot, five-bedroom house with lake views, an indoor swimming pool and space for an impressive art collection at 917 Edgemere Court.\nThe project required careful architectural maneuvering to fit a large building onto a narrow lot \u2014 roughly 50 feet wide and 330 feet deep \u2014 along with specialized construction to manage a high water table and\nshoreline erosion\n.\nThe earliest hurdle, however, was local politics. Previous owners tried and failed to develop the roughly half-acre site after proposing a modern design that ran afoul of neighbors and\nEvanston\u2019s\npreservation commission. The newspaper reported that rather than repeat that mistake, Ruderman and Empson started by calling nearby homeowners before closing on the property to understand what had sunk earlier plans.\nNeighbors made clear they wanted a home that blended with the surrounding 1920s-era houses and respected informal setback norms along the lake and street. With that guidance, the couple moved forward and hired Morgante Wilson Architects, a Chicago-area firm already familiar with the site\u2019s constraints.\nThe resulting design struck a compromise: a traditional front fa\u00e7ade with gables and a dormer to satisfy historic sensibilities, paired with a more contemporary, light-filled rear facing the lake. The plan sailed through the preservation commission.\nConstruction brought its own complexities, though. High lake levels had battered the backyard, prompting the team to design curving seawall-like features to deflect waves and protect the property. An indoor pool \u2014 a priority for the owners \u2014 required effectively building a sealed structure within the high water table.\nThe finished home also highlights a growing trend among affluent homeowners of designing for aging in place, according to the outlet. The\nhouse\nincludes an elevator, gym, spa and sauna, features that, along with the pool, proved especially meaningful after Empson was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease a year after moving in.\nShe told the Journal she feels \u201cso much peace and calm\u201d with the assumption she\u2019ll be able to remain in the home through her golden years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The new listings come after the sale last fall of Our Lady of Mount Carmel church in Cloverdale for $50,000 and the St. Francis church in Hopland for $275,000.\nThe Sebastopol property is nearly 2.5 acres north of Valentine Avenue and south of Saint Sebastian Church. Last fall, the diocese submitted an application to the city to split the 6.4-acre lot into a church parcel and a vacant parcel to sell. Potential buyers have already submitted offers on the property, though sales via\nbankruptcy\ncourt can take several months as purchase agreements must be approved by a judge and are open to being outbid by other parties.\nIn Yountville, the diocese is looking to offload a 12.4-acre vineyard behind Saint Joan of Arc church. That listing also includes a roughly 0.7-acre easement to access the vineyard from Highway 29. Zoning for that site allows for between 10 and 20 housing units per acre.\nTo the west in Santa Rosa, a sale is currently pending for the former residence for bishops and priests next to the historic Saint Rose of Lima Church. The 5,300-square-foot home at 547 B Street was listed for $475,000 and has been vacant for roughly a decade. A potential buyer has already deposited earnest money, or a percentage of the purchase price placed into an escrow account, with the diocese to secure the property in court.\nThe Rio Dell property consists of 8.2 acres of undeveloped land at 800 Rigby Avenue. The acreage is listed for $749,000. The city of Rio Dell is willing to work with a developer to create a\nresidential development\nthere, according to the Press Democrat. And in Napa, the diocese is offering a 750-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 918 Napa Street for $569,000. A sale is pending court review, per the Press Democrat.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

An affiliate of Stephen Deckoff\u2019s Black Diamond Capital Management won the property on Wednesday with a $175 million credit bid, meaning no new funds were expended.\nThe Black Diamond affiliate had purchased the debt on the property on Oct. 6.\nThe auction is a new low point in the decline of the regional mall, once valued at $881 million. Its most recent appraisal gave it a 78 percent haircut, pulling the value down to $191 million.\nThe October sale of the debt to Black Diamond also resolved the mall\u2019s loan, which had been securitized and sold to investors.\nThe original investment took a $231.4 million loss. Class B, C and D bondholders were\nentirely wiped out.\nClass A lost about 32 percent of its value, to the tune of $72 million.\nPyramid Management Group developed the mall in the late 1990s. In 2016, it took out a $418.5 million refinancing loan against the property.\nBut performance began to falter shortly after. JCPenney left its space in 2017, followed by Lord &amp; Taylor in 2019. Those anchor spaces have not been re-occupied.\nThe pandemic added new pains. Revenue dipped nearly $20 million \u2014 from $80.4 million in 2016 to $61.8 million in 2022, according to Morningstar Credit. That same year, occupancy fell to 78 percent and the loan was transferred to special servicing for maturity and monetary default. By 2023, expenses were 60 percent of revenue.\nCurrent tenants in the four-story, 1.9 million-square-foot property include Home Depot, Target, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, AMC and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, according to Morningstar. The most recent data, from 2024, shows revenue has fallen even further, to $55.2 million.\nPyramid Management Group has lost two other malls to foreclosure recently: the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York, and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, according to reporting from Syracuse.com.\nNeither attorneys for Black Diamond nor for the borrower immediately responded to a request for comment.",

        "content": "When Jennie Enterprise\nfounded Core Club\nin 2005, a soon-to-be important person put up financing: Jeffrey Epstein.\nWith his initial investment, Epstein secured himself a lifetime membership to the exclusive members-only club. And more than a decade later, as Core Club grew to a\nhub for real estate\u2019s elite\n, Epstein stayed involved in high-level business operations, introducing Enterprise to potential partners and offering advice on possible business structures. Enterprise also maintained a warm personal relationship with the disgraced financier and sex offender, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.\nEpstein\u2019s fellow founding members included Aby Rosen of RFR, Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group. The club also made headlines for a high-profile lawsuit with developer Michael Shvo, as well as disagreements with Rosen and RFR.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported that Epstein took credit for the club\u2019s success, writing,\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d\nin 2018. A spokesperson for Core denied at the time that Epstein had any business development role at the club.\nBut the latest tranche of files released by the Department of Justice shows that when Core Club\u2019s finances were ailing in 2015, Epstein stepped in as a confidante and connector.\n\u201c[Just] keeping you in the loop,\u201d Enterprise wrote to Epstein in 2016, in the midst of business negotiations. Attached in the email appear to be sheets of corporate tax returns and income statements for the club.\n\u201cUpdating my guardian angel \u2026.love you !\u201d she wrote that same year.\nIn response to the latest batch of emails, the spokesperson reiterated the claim that Epstein played no business development role in Core Club.\n\u201cWe stand by our initial statement that this individual had nothing to do with the founding of the company, or \u2018putting CORE: in business\u2019,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nAn early business partner\nEpstein first became involved in Core Club at its inception in the early 2000s. He paid $100,000 as a founding member, alongside 150 other investors, according to a spokesperson for Core.\nEmails between Epstein\u2019s staff refer to his investment in an entity called Core Club 55th Street LLC, most likely referring to the club\u2019s first location at RFR\u2019s 66 East 55th Street.\nIn 2014, Enterprise began a campaign to ask founding members to cancel their promissory notes to help the club pursue debt restructuring, according to paperwork in Epstein\u2019s files.\n\u201cBased upon the Club\u2019s own financial analysis, the Club has determined that in order to reach viability, among other things, it needs at least 90% of our Founding Members to execute and return the Settlement Agreement and affirm the cancellation of their promissory notes,\u201d Enterprise wrote to founding members.\nEpstein appears to have gone through with the cancellation, paying a discounted annual rate of $7,600 for his Core Club membership.\nThe spokesperson for Core said that Epstein rarely used the Club\u2019s member facilities and mostly received skin treatments, which are available to nonmembers.\nThere are scores of emails detailing Epstein\u2019s facial appointments with Dangene Enterprise, Jennie\u2019s wife.\nDangene and her staff sent Epstein a birthday email in 2019, months after a\nMiami Herald investigation\nraised widespread awareness of Epstein\u2019s role as a serial abuser of children.\nThey wrote in large purple font, \u201cWE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.\u201d\nAn almost-workout plan\nBy 2015, Epstein had introduced Core Club to a personal associate: inventor and investor Nathan Myhrvold.\nEmails detail that Myhrvold visited Epstein\u2019s island in 2011 and sent him books and pistachio ice cream in 2013. \u201cPussy doesn\u2019t FedEx well,\u201d he wrote the financier, who pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution five years earlier.\nA spokesperson for Myhrvold said he knew the financier from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research. \u201cHe regrets that he ever met him,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nEpstein first referred Myhrvold as a member of the club, according to a club spokesperson. Enterprise then pursued a business deal with him.\nIt was a difficult time for Core Club, which owed its landlord roughly $6.8 million in unpaid rent and was pursuing a debt restructuring plan, according to correspondence from Enterprise.\nEmails detail that Enterprise kept Epstein up to date about her talks with Myhrvold, sometimes asking for advice or wanting to hop on the phone to get info and prepare for meetings. He appeared to provide ideas as to how they could structure the deal.\nAt one point, Enterprise sent him a draft term sheet for Myhrvold\u2019s investment. Epstein OK\u2019d the file, saying she should send it before the would-be investor got cold feet.\n\u201cDo not copy me just send to him,\u201d Epstein wrote to Enterprise, \u201cwith a note that you are very excited to have him as a partner.\u201d\nAt least once during the negotiations, Epstein met privately with Myhrvold.\nEnterprise, who was being assisted by Rick Ross, chair of hotels and leisure at global law firm Dentons, was trying to get out of a business arrangement with Aby Rosen, whom Epstein separately claimed to have known for 20 years.\nEnterprise, Myhrvold and their teams worked out a potential plan: they would start a new company together, with Myhrvold making a $6 million convertible loan. They would move Core Club\u2019s intellectual property into the new company and license it back to the old LLC. The new company would buy existing debt from AES Holdings and then forgive it. Enterprise would be paid $100,000 for past services and then use that same money to pay off Rosen and RFR.\nThe parties explained via email that they had designed the deal to shield Myhrvold and the new company from taking on Core Club\u2019s tax risk.\nThe goal specifically appears to be to allow Myhrvold\u2019s investment to avoid taking on cancellation of indebtedness income but still use existing net operating losses to shield income from taxes, said Michael Meisler, a lecturer in taxation at Baruch College and former partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who reviewed a selection of emails but was otherwise unfamiliar with the deal or the parties.\nCancellation of indebtedness income occurs when one\u2019s debt is cancelled, and that canceled debt can then be taxed as income by the IRS.\nNet operating losses can be carried forward in time to decrease taxable income. The deal was designed to protect that ability to shield the new income from Myhrvold\u2019s investment.\n\u201cWhen you have a highly structured transaction that goes out of its way to say, \u2018We are doing this just to achieve this desired tax result,\u2019 that\u2019s usually a red flag for something that probably has a lot of risk to it,\u201d Meisler said.\nSpokespersons for Core Club and for Myhrvold said no deal between the parties ever materialized.\n\u201cCORE: has consistently been presented with business opportunities throughout our twenty-year history,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis individual [Epstein] referred a member who then presented a business opportunity a decade after the founding of the company.\u201d\nNeither Dentons, Ross nor representatives for Rosen responded to a request for comment.\n",

The vote also enables some permanent projects to be exempted from zoning regulations if the council individually signs off on them. The types of structures that could be built under the new ordinance remain unclear.\nThe 2028 Games were advertised as a \u201cno-build\u201d Olympics that utilized facilities across Greater Los Angeles for events, though that no longer appears to be the case.\n\u201cMany elements and activities of the 2028 Games will require building and developments, including but not limited to the buildout or improvements to temporary and permanent venues, training facilities, security perimeters, broadcast and media centers, transit infrastructure, live sites and fan zones, and associated structures,\u201d Council member Traci Park said in a motion supporting the legislation.\nPart of the ordinance includes an amendment from Council member\nNithya Raman\nrequiring the Los Angeles\nDepartment of City Planning\nto create clear criteria that temporary projects would need to meet to be made permanent following the events. The amended ordinance also calls for the creation of quarterly reports of applications for temporary projects so that council members can review them and track any new developments in their districts. These projects would receive approval in 14 days.\n\u201cIt puts the onus on us to get ourselves organized and really make it easy for people to put up these structures and everything that\u2019s going to need to go into the Games,\u201d Council member Katy Yaroslavsky said.\nBesides being initially billed as a \u201cno-build\u201d Olympics, the 2028 Games were also touted as \u201cno-cost\u201d to taxpayers, though the city and governing organization LA28 are finalizing an agreement that outlines just how much the Olympics will actually cost the public. Discussions are ongoing despite an October 2025 deadline.\n\u201cLos Angeles faces multiple fiscal hazards that many current leaders negotiating this and other Olympics agreements, will not be around to face,\u201d civil rights attorney Connie Rice told\nMayor Karen Bass\nand other city leaders last fall, per Bisnow. \u201cThe city cannot afford an additional $1.5 billion hit in 2028 because city officials inadequately protected taxpayers in 2025.\u201d The city is already projecting a budget shortfall of $1 billion not counting Olympic costs.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Developers have spoken: building rental housing in New York just doesn\u2019t pencil out without tax abatement.\nNow, the city comptroller\u2019s office is proposing the rules to implement New York\u2019s most recent tax abatement program, 485x.\nThe program has gained attention for its requirement that projects of 100 or more units pay a minimum construction wage of $40 per hour. That minimum wage rises higher for even bigger projects. In response, developers have pulled back on large-scale projects.\nThe comptroller\u2019s proposal departs from the statute in a few ways. And industry groups are already voicing concerns.\nOne sticking point for both developers and construction industry reps is the timeline to get an exemption on the rules.\nThe comptroller proposes that developers who have a labor agreement need to notify the office five months before construction for an exemption. This goes beyond the statute, which specified three months of notice needed.\nAlvin Schein, a partner and attorney at Adler &amp; Stachenfeld, called the requirement \u201cexceedingly onerous.\u201d The requirement would mean project owners would need to either wait to award labor bids or make them contingent on controller approval, Schein said in a written public comment.\nFelice Farber, executive director of the Subcontractors Trade Association, said she believes it shouldn\u2019t be up to the comptroller\u2019s office to approve exemptions; they should be granted automatically.\nAnother industry pain point is in the proposal\u2019s definition of wages. The comptroller proposes limiting the wage definition to only hourly wages. That excludes payroll taxes and other legally required contributions. The Real Estate Board of New York took issue with this, saying the statute explicitly includes employee benefits and employer taxes.\nAdditionally, the comptroller\u2019s office attempts to define what the statute calls the \u201cgreatest prevailing wage.\u201d The office defines it as the highest rate for a classification in the Comptroller\u2019s schedules, without taking into account experience tiers. \u201cApplying the top highest rate regardless of a worker\u2019s experience will raise costs and diverges from prevailing wage norms that tie rates to experience or apprenticeship progression,\u201d REBNY said in a written comment.\nNow, this is just a proposal and will be tinkered with. But the cost of any slip-ups could be high for developers. The law says that the comptroller can end and take back 485x benefits after three violations in five years. Losing the benefit would be the difference between making money and not for many projects.\nBuilding Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which represents union construction employers, said it supported the comptroller\u2019s office\u2019s efforts to \u201cprovide meaningful oversight and hold developers accountable.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe Department of Justice has released a trove of documents related to its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. We\u2019ve started going through those and have published some stories, including one on\nEpstein\u2019s connections with Core Club and Jennie Enterprise\n. But there are thousands of documents. Something catch your eye? Drop me a note at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe Big Apple is in for a big freeze this weekend, with a low of -1 on Sunday. But this is 14 degrees warmer than the coldest Central Park has observed, which was -15 degrees in 1934.\nElsewhere:\n\u2014 Brooklyn Democrats are once again backing Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s re-election after pulling support.\nPolitico reports\nthat leadership initially yanked its endorsement for Hochul due to her pick of Adrienne Adams as her potential second-in-command. Sources told the outlet that Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn has long harbored a personal vendetta against Adams. Bichotte Hermelyn has insisted there is no bad blood.\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani inked an\nexecutive order\nFriday underlining New York\u2019s sanctuary city policies. He directed city agencies to audit their internal policies related to federal immigration enforcement, reiterating that city data cannot be shared except when required by law.\n\u2014 In the Tristate area, progressive candidate Analilia Mejia maintains a narrow lead over competitor Tom Malinowski in the Democratic primary for New Jersey\u2019s 11th district. Democrat Mikie Sherill vacated the seat when she was inaugurated as governor. The special election is April 16.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$13.4 million\nfor 50 West 66th Street, 11D. The new construction condo unit on the Upper West Side is 3,900 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing through developer Extell Marketing Group.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31.8 million\nfor 67 Greene Street. The Soho building is a mixed-use, four-family rental with an office component. It\u2019s over 10,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.5 million for 763 Greenwich Street. The West Village townhome is 5,500 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nChris Poore and Serena Boardman have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Cayre Equities turned a tidy profit on a Midtown South office building, likely thanks to the neighborhood\u2019s rezoning.\nThe firm sold a 16-story property at 254 West 35th Street in the Garment District for $26.2 million, notching a roughly $10 million gain in less than two years. Cayre bought the 106,000-square-foot property in December 2024 for $16.2 million with plans to convert it to self-storage, then flipped it to Joel Wertzberger\u2019s Joyland for a 62 percent jump in value, property records show.\nThe deal comes six months after the City Council approved Midtown South\u2019s long-awaited rezoning, unlocking high-density residential development across large swaths of the neighborhood. Plans for a residential conversion were filed in January, according to PincusCo, which first reported the sale, brokered by Itanel Rahamani of Venture Capital Properties.\nJoyland nabbed a $27 million loan from Levon Capital to finance the purchase. The debt was arranged by Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital.\nThe value surge was likely driven by the rezoning, which makes residential development feasible. The building was zoned as industrial but is now part of a mixed-use district that allows residential, commercial, community facility and light manufacturing uses.\nThe Midtown South rezoning created two new high-density residential districts that allow projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. The changes apply to four pockets of Midtown South long dominated by manufacturing zoning that either barred housing outright or capped density.\nJoyland apparently doesn\u2019t plan to build the project itself. At the same time as the purchase, the firm signed a 99-year ground lease with Brooklyn developer Mendel Fleischman valued at $6.8 million.\nCayre and Wertzberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nKeith Larsen contributed reporting.\n",

The site has already been proposed for a 650-unit, 35-story high-rise market-rate residential tower and a four-story, 240-room luxury hotel.\nThose previous plans, by Sandstone, are expected to be scuttled, instead making way for 100-percent affordable housing in a mixed-use development as part of the ongoing makeover of the Warner Center district, according to the Times. Initial planning is already underway as Wellpointe seeks to bring fully affordable residences, separate high-rises and unspecified mixed-use elements for public use. Additional details including design and construction timelines will be disclosed as the project moves through the entitlement process.\nWellpointe is looking to \u201cdeliver quality housing at scale with a focus on affordability,\u201d said George Kutnerian, CEO of Wellpointe, said, per the Times. The Warner Center purchase is part of the company\u2019s goal of providing \u201caccess to high-density, quality housing and social infrastructure that is complementary to the area\u2019s transformation.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan calls for turning the area within downtown Woodland Hills into an all-purpose entertainment and residential district in the San Fernando Valley.

Toll Brothers has proposed demolishing offices at 6464 Canoga Avenue and replacing it with an eight-story building with 276 apartments and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The developer will be required to designate 21 apartments for very low-income households.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "CW Capital Asset Management\nhas seized ownership of a\nMid-Market office building\nonce home to City of San Francisco offices.\nAn affiliate of the Washington, D.C.-based firm\nacquired\nthe bottom eight floors of 1155 Market Street at a foreclosure auction for $4 million, the San Francisco Business Times reported. CW was appointed as special servicer for the $48 million loan tied to the lower eight floors of the 11-story building.\nThe $48 million loan backed by the portion of 1155 Market\nmoved to special servicing\nahead of \u201cimminent default\u201d in March 2024, per Morningstar data cited by the Business Times. In late 2023, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors failed to pass a resolution extending the city\u2019s lease at 1155 Market, citing cheaper rents available elsewhere in the Mid-Market area. The Mayor\u2019s Office of Disability, the Department of the Environment and the Office of the Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector had offices there prior to the city\u2019s decision not to renew; those agencies have since moved to separate offices across the city. Lenders received a notice of default for the debt in June 2024 and\nsued to foreclose that same month\n.\nThe foreclosure at the building could enable CW to find a new investor or owner for the eight-story portion, though the split nature of ownership at the building could drive away some prospective buyers, according to the Business Times.\nSan Francisco-based nonprofit LightHouse for the Blind acquired a 90 percent stake in the lower eight floors of 1155 Market from investor Patson Companies, which retained the remaining 10 percent stake, in late 2015. That deal also included LightHouse for the Blind\u2019s acquisition of the top three floors for its headquarters.\nThe top three floors of the building are not linked to the $48 million loan and are still under LightHouse\u2019s ownership. The portion of the building now under CW\u2019s control also includes a subterranean parking garage, the building\u2019s roof and the land underneath the building.\nThe lower eight floors of 1155 Market were valued at $80 million in 2015, according to the Business Times. Its value plummeted to $8.5 million after its most recent appraisal last October.\nThe outstanding debt on the eight-story portion at the time of the foreclosure auction was almost $65 million. Those floors were 100 percent vacant as of the end of last year, though the receiver has reportedly been negotiating leases that would bring occupancy up to roughly 30 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A 6,400-acre ranch in\nEast Texas\nrecently sold under a conservation easement, marking an unusual sale in the Texas land business.\nThe Bobcat Ridge Ranch, east of Palestine on the Neches River, recently sold after asking $26.5 million, or about $4,100 per acre. The final sale price isn\u2019t available.\nThe seller was an area forester named Forrest Hodges, who owns a family-run logging company headquartered nearby. The buyer is an LLC, also based locally. The owner intends to make the land a family compound, according to listing agent Tyler Jacobs, a real estate partner at\nHall and Hall\n.\nThe land is in prime timber country, but it also doubles as a hunting destination, offering another potential income source. The seller imported native South Texas deer to improve the genetics of the local game, and most of the border is high-fenced, Jacobs said. A 5,200-square-foot lodge sleeps 23 people, and other improvements include dog kennels, additional guides\u2019 quarters by the lodge and shooting ranges for rifle, pistol and shotgun, according to the listing. The land spreads along 13 miles of the Neches River.\nExcept for some of the acreage around the lodge, the land is under a perpetual conservation easement intended to preserve open space and native wildlife. The easement forbids owners from subdividing the land, a\nrestriction that repels most buyers with a commercial interest\nbut attracts those who\nprize conservation\n.\nConservation easements are more common in western states like New Mexico, but in Texas, \u201cto my knowledge, that\u2019s the largest sale of a conserved property in a very, very long time,\u201d Jacobs said.\nAnother recently marketed family ranch, the 8,500-acre\nNineteen Mile Ranch\nnorthwest of San Antonio, is under a conservation easement, but it was taken off the market in 2024. Last year, an environmental organization obtained a conservation easement for the 6,600-acre\nT.M. O\u2019Connor Ranch in Goliad County\n, but the ranch remains under family ownership.\nIt\u2019s also unusual for family-owned timberland sales to attain this acreage in East Texas, according to Jacobs.\n\u201cIn East Texas, you generally have two timber operators: You have the family that\u2019s owned 100 acres forever, and then all the other companies are owned mostly by\ninstitutions\n, like pension funds,\u201d Jacobs said.Due to the abundance of water in East Texas, and its scarcity in West Texas, settlers and farmers also\nhistorically\nrequired larger tracts in the west.\n",

        "content": "When you think of rent-stabilized bankruptcies, you probably think of overleveraged buildings in Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx \u2014 not conservatively financed ones in white-ethnic Brooklyn neighborhoods.\nThink again.\nConsider the bankruptcy that Samuel Hertz filed in late January for 420 Avenue F and 320 Ocean Parkway in Kensington and 2302 85th Street in Bensonhurst, which have 145 apartments in all. Their tenants have names like Melnikova, Akramov, Durglishvili and Ananin.\nHertz\nbought\nthe three buildings in January 2018 for $46 million with a $25 million loan from ConnectOne Bank. That\u2019s a loan-to-value ratio of only 54 percent. It must have seemed like a safe bet at the time and was also a 1031 exchange, allowing Hertz to defer capital gains on a\nvery profitable 2017 sale\n.\nBut 2018 was a terrible, awful, no-good year to buy a rent-stabilized building. It\u2019s hard to imagine that any deals that year didn\u2019t end up in some kind of trouble. And $317,000 per unit was a lot for Hertz to pay.\nThe big blow was the rent-strangling Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, followed by the pandemic, \u201ccancel rent\u201d movement, eviction moratoriums and\nhousing court dysfunction\n. Then operating expenses surged but the Rent Guidelines Board\nremained stingy\nwith rent increases.\nThe 2019 law and pandemic fallout \u201chave dramatically eroded the value of the properties and hindered rent collections,\u201d Hertz wrote in his court filing.\nHertz, based at 1080 Ocean Avenue, seems to have tried to do the right thing. The investor actually paid down his mortgages by $1.83 million and sunk in another $1.95 million to subsidize operations, in part by taking out more loans.\nBut in retrospect, it looks like he threw good money after bad. Every month, all three buildings lose money.\nTake 420 Avenue F. The monthly rent collection is $96,000, or about $1,900 per unit (three units are not producing rent).\nMonthly costs include $49,000 for mortgage interest, $20,000 for property taxes, $7,000 for management fees, $6,000 for insurance and $6,000 for water and sewer.\nAdd in other expenses and the total comes to $106,000, which means the building loses $10,000 every month.\nBut it\u2019s probably worse, because Hertz\u2019s filing says repairs and maintenance cost just $32 per unit. A realistic number is several times that amount. Also, his actual rent collection is probably\nlower\nthan the 96 percent shown in his filing.\nThe mortgage calls for him to pay down nearly $13,000 in principal each month. That brings the monthly loss to more than $22,000.\nThe 85th Street building loses $18,000 a month, and 320 Ocean Parkway, the most valuable in the portfolio, loses $22,000. Half of those losses are going to pay mortgage principal, as lenders now commonly require for rent-stabilized buildings.\nBut even if the loans were interest-only, Hertz would be swimming in red ink.\nPaying mortgage principal is fine when your property value is going up, but not when it\u2019s going down. It\u2019s kind of like making car loan payments when you owe more than the vehicle is worth.\nHertz sought bankruptcy protection after ConnectOne Bank filed a foreclosure action in November.\nHe said in the filing that he is \u201ccontinuing to struggle with rent collections, evictions, and the increased cost of maintenance and operations.\u201d But he noted the buildings would be financially viable if the mortgage debt were reduced.\nThat\u2019s one option for ConnectOne Bank. Another would be to sell the loans for dimes on the dollar. A third would be to foreclose and sell the properties at auction.\nAs the saying goes, pick your poison.\n",

        "content": "Sales at Michael Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental Residences on Fifth Avenue are being reset once again with a new brokerage team stepping in and prices being recalibrated after years of sluggish momentum.\nSerhant has\ntaken over\nmarketing at the 65-unit luxury condominium project, assigning Peter Zaitzeff and Glenn Davis to lead the effort. The move marks the latest attempt to unlock sales at the building, which launched in 2021 but has moved only about a third of its inventory in the four-plus years since.\nAlongside the brokerage switch comes a notable pricing overhaul. Listings reflect double-digit reductions from original asking prices laid out in the offering plan. A two-bedroom unit is now priced at $5.3 million, while a one-bedroom spanning more than 1,000 square feet is listed for $4.25 million, down from nearly $6 million. The pricing adjustment is intended to realign the project with buyer expectations after earlier pricing failed to generate sustained demand.\nThe reboot follows earlier signs of distress around the unsold inventory. In the fall, Shvo and his investment partners, which include Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, engaged Eastdil Secured to explore a bulk disposition of remaining units. While that option has not been ruled out, the latest strategy centers on individual condo sales rather than an institutional exit.\nFinancial pressure has also shaped the project\u2019s trajectory. In September 2024, the ownership group secured a $120 million inventory loan from Northwind Group tied to the unsold condos. At that point, just 15 units had closed, far short of the $340 million sellout projected when the development was marketed. Roughly 45 units remain on the market.\nThe property occupies the former Gucci headquarters at 685 Fifth Avenue, which Shvo and his partners purchased in 2018 for $135 million. The redevelopment converted office space into residential use and added floors atop the building. The project is positioned as Mandarin Oriental\u2019s first residential-only property on the East Coast, offering hotel-branded amenities including a private dining venue overseen by Daniel Boulud.\nThe Fifth Avenue project is unfolding against a turbulent backdrop for Shvo\u2019s broader portfolio.\nThe developer recently sold the Raleigh Rosewood Residences in Miami Beach, defaulted on debt tied to the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills and remains involved in litigation related to both condo finishes in New York and disputes tied to Core Club.\nSuper Bowl hype and Winter Olympics fever keep you away from the real estate headlines this week? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re speed skating the top stories straight to your eyes.\nEmpire State Realty eyes $350M for Billionaires Row office building\nEmpire State Realty Trust listed its 540,000-square-foot office building at 250 West 57th Street, located on Billionaires Row, for an estimated price of $350 million.\nThe 26-story property is 84 percent leased; T.J. Maxx is set to anchor the retail portion until 2041.\nESRT bought the building in 2013 for $170 million and has invested about $140 million in capital improvements.\nAfter eviction threat, Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network makes way for One45 project\nRev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network vacated its long-time Harlem headquarters at 106-108 West 145th Street at the end of January, following an eviction order signed by a judge.\nThe move resolved a dispute with landlord Bruce Teitelbaum and made way for his previously delayed One45 housing development, which is expected to include 1,000 apartments across three buildings, at least 338 of which will be designated as affordable.\nTop bankruptcy attorney Jonathan Pasternak suspended for three years in NY\u2019s Southern District\nJonathan Pasternak, a top bankruptcy attorney, was suspended for three years from practicing law in New York\u2019s Southern District Court for receiving $260,000 in undisclosed payments from controversial real estate investor Sam Sprei during a bankruptcy case.\nThe payments were related to the bankruptcy of a medical office property at 261 East 78th Street, where Pasternak advised his client, Lee Moncho, to use Sprei as a buyer.\n\u201cHardest moment of my life\u201d: Woman testifies about alleged attack filmed by Oren Alexander\nThe second week of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial resumed testimony with a\nvideo of an alleged attack presented in the case\n, showing Oren Alexander having sex with a 17-year-old woman who says she had no memory of the encounter or recording before she was contacted by the government.\nThe video and two witnesses that led off the week\u2019s proceedings add to the growing list of evidence and women presented to the court by prosecutors\nalleging brothers Oren, Alon and Tal\nworked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women.\nThe brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.\n",

        "content": "Marc Reinisch is getting a reality check on the value of his long-held\nGold Coast\nretail property.\nAn affiliate of his firm Rushmore Properties is staring down a foreclosure lawsuit over the retail portion of 100 East Walton Street, a two-building commercial block reaching 44 stories into the sky, where the lower floors of shopping has been a fixture of the firm\u2019s portfolio for 30-plus years, according to Cook County court and property records.\nThe legal move comes as the retail property\u2019s value has cratered by more than 40 percent from its peak a decade ago, according to loan data.\nReinisch didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney for LNR handling the foreclosure litigation.\nWhen Reinisch secured\u00a0 the $9.3 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan for the 46,700-square-foot property back in 2015, it was appraised at $20.3 million. Fast forward to October 2025, and an updated appraisal pegged its worth at just $11.8 million.\nThe property is just barely treading water. If the appraisal is to be believed, practically the entire principal of the loan remains unpaid along plus $500,000 in additional interest, including default interest, and further penalties accruing daily for the borrower.\nThe valuation drop highlights a widening rift in the Gold Coast: while luxury tenants are flocking to Oak and\nRush streets\nin lieu of the\nMagnificent Mile\n\u2014 where vacancy remains elevated above 25 percent \u2014 older, mixed-use retail blocks like 100 East Walton are struggling to keep pace.\nThe loan\u2019s special servicer LNR Partners is pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously negotiating a potential workout with Reinisch. The situation turned critical following the loan\u2019s maturity in August 2025 that came and went without repayment from the longtime landlord, who\u2019s been involved in acquiring $250 million of real estate for Rushmore.\nThe property\u2019s vitals have been unsteady. Occupancy fell to 67 percent at the end of 2024, down from 86 percent when the loan was first underwritten, public loan data shows. As a result, the debt service coverage ratio plummeted to 0.54, meaning the property is only generating about half the income needed to cover its debt payments. Operating cost expenses are eating up 80 percent of the total revenue, which sat at over $1.4 million for 2024, the loan data shows.\nReinisch has been searching for an exit ramp for some time. A broker with Mid-America Real Estate Corporation was sharing the property\u2019s listing with potential buyers over the summer last year while seeking about $12.5 million. Offers came in at eight figures but shy of the asking, according to people familiar with the market. It\u2019s unclear why they weren\u2019t accepted before the borrower ran out the lender\u2019s shot clock.\nFor Reinisch, who has led Rushmore through the acquisition of over 5 million square feet of real estate, the Walton Street woes are a rare public stumble. It serves as a stark reminder that even in Chicago\u2019s most prestigious submarkets, property values can fall suddenly and without regard for what might seem like a cautious, low-leverage owner\u2019s pricing expectations.\n",

        "content": "If you missed the Los Angeles\nState of the City\n, don\u2019t worry.\nThat\u2019s because a firm grip on where the mayor stands on proposed reforms for Measure United to House L.A. \u2014 one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches \u2014 wasn\u2019t part of the keynote.\nThe silence was deafening considering the shouting match that ensued in the week prior to Feb. 2\u2019s address, held at the Expo Center.\nThat was the week when prominent Progressive councilmember Nithya Raman sought her colleagues\u2019 approval to create a\n15-year exemption\nfrom ULA for new construction multifamily, mixed-use and commercial projects, along with a one-time carveout for properties impacted by a natural disaster. Some council members, along with the\nMeasure ULA Citizens Oversight Committee\n, were miffed at the attempted fast-track to get the proposal on June\u2019s ballot. It\u2019s now sitting with the city\u2019s Housing and Homelessness Committee.\nIn short, whether there\u2019s relief for residential and commercial real estate from the 4 percent tax on properties selling for $5.3 million or more (or 5.5 percent for those priced at $10.6 million and up), remains a question mark.\nOn Downtown\nTwo different realities \u2014 both extremes \u2014 are playing out for Downtown Los Angeles, depending on who you ask.\nBass is on a roll touting proof points Downtown is being revitalized.\n\u201cBusinesses are relocating, expanding their headquarters here,\u201d she said during her State of the City address. \u201cLast year, the city council, the labor movement, business and community leaders came together to pass much needed legislation to expand the L.A. Convention Center. As a result, marquee conventions are booking as we speak.\u201d\nThat includes the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (15,000 people in 2031), American Geophysical Union (25,000 people in 2032) and International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference and Exposition (15,000 people in 2037).\nOn the flipside, there\u2019s billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who told KNX News this week that Downtown has been \u201cdecimated\u201d by crime and homelessness. He slammed Downtown for its \u201cgraffiti towers\u201d in the unfinished Oceanwide Plaza and cited a 40 percent vacancy rate among offices (a CBRE fourth-quarter report pegged it at about 25 percent).\nWill he or won\u2019t he?\nBy the time you read this, the deadline for\nL.A. mayoral candidates\nto declare their intent to run will have passed on Saturday.\nBy then, a full and final view of who is going up against Bass on the June ticket will be known.\nFor less than a day it seemed like Caruso was\nback in the mix\nafter telling KNX he needs some time to \u201cprocess\u201d a damning report from the Los Angeles Times alleging Bass ordered the watering down of the after-action report analyzing the city and emergency services\u2019 responses to last January\u2019s Palisades Fire. The Times report, which Bass\u2019s office refuted, led to questions of whether Caruso might reconsider last month\u2019s announcement to not run for political office. He added that he\u2019d speak with family and \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d The next day his political consultant, Mike Murphy,\nreportedly\nshut down any prospects of a reversal on January\u2019s decision to not run.\nAnd, that\u2019s that \u2014 for now anyhow.\nTrading spaces\nRecent months have seen a flurry of recruiting activity among residential brokerages.\nJustin Alexander\nand most of his team headed for the exit at Hilton Hilton to make a jump to The Agency. Interesting move that leaves Alexander\u2019s former firm with four agents, according to California Department of Real Estate records as of Friday. The brokerage helmed by Rick Hilton already saw a big departure last fall when Hilton\u2019s son, Barron Hilton and Barron\u2019s wife Tessa Hilton, decamped to Compass. That the couple, who were the Beverly Hills brokerage\u2019s co-CEOs and co-founders, made the decision to leave was a curious one.\nAlexander wasn\u2019t the only one looking for a change of scenery.\nElsewhere, Jon Grauman and Adam Rosenfeld\u2019s\nResident Group\nbrought on Kevin Stewart as a partner. They plucked him from their former firm, The Agency.\nMeanwhile, Coldwell Banker Realty Foothills office manager Lori Ramirez was also heads down on recruiting. Over the past year, she\u2019s brought on 29 agents across the Pasadena, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and San Marino offices, with nearly half of those new recruits joining the brokerage in the past three months.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019s mayoral race got a lot more interesting hours before the cutoff for candidates to file to run in the June primary.\nProminent progressive Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2014 a member of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 is reportedly in the mix to run against incumbent Mayor Karen Bass. Raman\u2019s entry caps what has been a buzzy week for the June election, and offers real estate a candidate that\u2019s taken a clear stance on one of the industry\u2019s hottest topics in\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nInquiries to Raman\u2019s press office were not immediately returned Saturday morning. Candidates have until noon Pacific Standard Time to file their declarations to the city clerk, which had not yet updated that filing roster as of early Saturday.\nWhile Raman told the\nLos Angeles Times\nshe holds a \u201cdeep respect\u201d for Bass, she said recent months have underscored a need for change within the city.\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve really begun to feel like unless we have some big changes in how we do things in Los Angeles, that the things we count on are not going to function anymore,\u201d Raman told the Times.\nHer declaration to run adds to what\u2019s now a crowded field of mayoral hopefuls and a week that saw former Los Angeles School District Superintendent Austin Beutner drop out of the race,\nRick Caruso\nconsider for less than a day\nwalking back\nlast month\u2019s statements about not running, and tech entrepreneur Adam Miller enter the mix.\nMeanwhile, former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nofficially kicked off his campaign Feb. 4. There\u2019s also another DSA member,\nRae Chen Huang\n, who announced her candidacy in November.\nReal estate angle\nRaman\u2019s announcement comes just days after Bass delivered her State of the City in which she largely shied from one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches in Measure ULA.\nRaman instead took aim at the so-called mansion tax late last month when she sought her councilmember peers\u2019 approval to push some of the most aggressive\ncarveouts\nfor the two-tier tax through to the June ballot. The council didn\u2019t bite during its Jan. 27 meeting, instead kicking the proposal to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n.\nSupporters of the tax have criticized Raman\u2019s proposed changes, offering that they largely give in to real estate and broader business interests. The critics are generally on the left of L.A.\u2019s political spectrum, which has been the core of Raman\u2019s base.\nRaman\u2019s idea to amend the ballot measure that voters passed in 2022 includes a 15-year exemption from ULA for new construction multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a one-time carveout for properties impacted by a natural disaster, which would be retroactive to January of 2025 to account for Palisades Fire survivors.\nULA went into effect in 2023 and currently applies a 4 percent tax to any property sales \u2014 commercial or residential \u2014 starting at $5.3 million. That bumps up to 5.5 percent on any deals of $10.6 million or more.\nReal estate largely hailed the proposed changes after nearly three years of agents, brokers and developers lamenting stalled deals and a pall cast on the flow of financing for construction of housing and other commercial projects as a result of the tax.\nCityview CEO and Chief Investment Officer Sean Burton called the changes a \u201chuge move forward\u201d and said they resulted from months of conversations involving real estate, business leaders, non-profits and other interests looking to find ways of addressing what Raman called the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the tax.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen construction fall off a cliff for any sort of market rate housing or affordable housing,\u201d Burton said of the tax\u2019s impact. \u201cL.A.\u2019s been redlined by the investment community because of ULA.\u201d\nSo far, ULA has raised over $1 billion since its rollout \u2014 a figure proponents often cite as a proof point of the tax\u2019s efficacy. Still, that\u2019s off from the original range of $600 million to $1.1 billion generated annually that voters were pitched when the tax went on the ballot.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a few hurdles away from being a real estate story, but\nTaylor Rehmet\n\u2019s decisive defeat of Trump-backed state senate candidate Leigh Wambsganss in deep red Tarrant County is making serious waves.\nThe fact that Rehmet had a chance to win the Jan. 31 runoff for state senator in a district Trump carried by 17 points in 2024 earned the race\na Jan. 29 profile\nin The New York Times. When Rehmet, an Air Force vet and Lockheed Martin aircraft mechanic and union leader, won by a 14-point margin, everyone was talking about Fort Worth, with Democrats around the country looking to the race as a possible bellwether and Republicans taking the contest as a warning.\nBefore anyone gets too riled up, it must be noted that the results are somewhat temporary. Rehmet and Wambsganss will face off again in November for a chance to represent the district for a full four-year term. Since the Texas legislature meets every other year, with its most recent session in 2025, a different outcome in November would mean Rehmet never casts a vote.\nThe whole saga puts Miriam Adelson in somewhat of an awkward position.\nThe billionaire boss of casino empire Las Vegas Sands has spent multiple years and millions of dollars lobbying to get casino gambling legalized in Texas so Sands can build a casino-anchored arena district for the Dallas Mavericks, which Adelson purchased in 2023.\nSo, when Wambsganss echoed the anti-casino sentiment of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick,\nSands backed her Republican challenger\nJon Huffman \u2014 to the tune of $3.5 million in the original Nov. 2025 election to fill the seat Kelly Hancock vacated.\nMeanwhile, Rehmet has signaled he\u2019s open to expanding gambling if it brings \u201cgood union-paying jobs.\u201d Adelson supports Trump to the extent that she\u2019s pushing him to run for a third term in 2028, but she\u2019s not above donating to Democrats; she\u2019s donated handsomely to Democratic darling and U.S. Senate candidate James Talarico.\nHistoric homes in teardown-happy Texas\nIn a state where buyers prefer to start over when getting a new house,\nhistoric homes\nare rare and often overlooked. But, in today\u2019s softening luxury market, these old manses have proven to hold their value. For example, the state\u2019s most expensive listing is for a historic home.\nDallas\u2019 Crespi Estate\n, at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane, is asking $64 million. The house was built in 1938.\nTroubled CRE debt tops $800M\nFebruary marks the third month in a row that troubled CRE debt tied to Texas Triangle properties\ntopped $800 million\n. The round of foreclosure notices that went out last month included bad news for Dallas\u2019 beleaguered urban core.\nStarwood foreclosed on The National\n, Todd Interests\u2019 mammoth mixed-use conversion project and one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country. Shawn Todd\u2019s firm spent $460 million carving the project out of the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower.\nCamden\u2019s CA exit\nCamden Property Trust\u2019s love affair with Texas started when founder Richard Campo moved from Southern California to Houston in 1976. By listing its\n$1.5 billion California apartment portfolio\n, Camden has signaled that it might be planning to leave the state altogether. The trust quietly listed 11 properties and is marketing the assets through JLL, Bisnow reported. The portfolio spans roughly 3,600 units split between Los Angeles-Orange County and the San Diego-Inland Empire region, according to Piper Sandler.\nTexas\u2019 buyer friendliness\nThe pandemic-era housing boom is in the rearview mirror, but it\u2019s not clear whether we\u2019re reverting to pre-pandemic conditions or facing a significant downturn. In Texas, 75 percent of homes sold for\nbelow asking price\nin major cities, establishing it as a buyer-friendly state, with Austin leading at 82 percent and followed by Dallas (79.4 percent), Houston (78 percent) and Fort Worth (74 percent).\n",

        "content": "Laura Clark has led earnings calls before but Thursday\u2019s was her first as incoming chief executive of Rexford Industrial. The call began with a pre-recorded personal note from co-founders and co-CEOs Michael Frankel and Howard Schwimmer, who were not on the call. Clark thanked the founders, who she\u2019ll soon\nreplace\nin the Elliott era, but made it clear Rexford\u2019s next chapter has begun.\nEarnings were\nmixed\n. The real estate investment trust reported losses in the fourth quarter but was still profitable for all of 2025. It blamed losses on sell-offs of several properties along with co-CEO transition costs\u2013and we know Frankel and Schwimmer were granted stock awards valued at more than $20 million each. The big payouts made it all the more notable that Clark, on the call, mentioned Rexford was realigning executive compensation with shareholders\u2019 expectations.\nThe latest proxy shows that Frankel and Schwimmer raked in $13 million in total compensation in 2024, with base salaries of $1 million. Clark\u2019s base will be $850,000, per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and her annual cash incentive opportunities are 25 percent below her predecessors.\nElliott\u2019s hand in the departures and changes going forward seem clear, including a strategic imperative that has Rexford disposing of real estate and buying back shares. One analyst said he understood Clark was new to the corner office but bluntly asked what if the new strategy isn\u2019t successful?

        "content": "Two Roads Development sued the holdout owners at Biscayne 21, adding another twist to the saga.\nThe developer has been\nlocked in litigation\nwith the holdout owners of the bayfront condo building in Miami\u2019s Edgewater since 2023. A year earlier, Two Roads paid about $150 million for the majority of units at the building, which was constructed in 1964. The developer then launched sales of an Edition-branded condo project.\nLast year, as part of the holdout owners\u2019 suit, the developer-controlled condo association was found to have illegally amended the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nIn January of this year, Two Roads was ordered to restore the building to a habitable state, including repairs and restoring utilities such as air conditioning, water and electricity.\nBut now, Two Roads is on the offense.\nTwo Roads\u2019 affiliate, TRD Biscayne, is asking the court for equitable relief, which includes terminating the condo association. In its complaint filed at the end of January, Two Roads alleges that the unit owners are blaming the developer for issues that existed before Two Roads entered the picture. The tower \u201cstands vacant, uninhabitable, and condemned resulting from decades of lack of maintenance deferred by its former owners, including the individual unit owners,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nTaylor Collins, a managing partner at Two Roads, said the same in an interview last week. The cost to return the building to a habitable condition is about $61 million, according to the complaint.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to repair it,\u201d he said. If the court rules in favor of the developer, Collins said that the property could go to a court-ordered partition sale. That means Two Roads could buy out the rest of the owners or a new developer could purchase the property.\n\u201cI hope this comes to closure faster than that,\u201d he said.\nMore to come on Monday.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill we see more lawsuits\nsimilar to the one filed\nby the condo association at Aston Martin Residences against the developer, Germ\u00e1n Coto? The complaint alleges that Coto ran \u201can immense shell game\u201d to defraud the association before unit owners took over the board.

        "content": "In Los Gatos, the quaint town in the Santa Cruz Mountains widely viewed as the southern gateway to Silicon Valley, the crown for tallest building is shared between The Altan condominium and the El Gato Penthouse apartments, which each reportedly rising about 61 feet.\nNow, after a court ruling last week, Los Gatos will be forced to process a pair of applications that propose apartment buildings between 100 and 120 feet in height, not to mention the combined 292 new housing units intended to come with them. The court\u2019s decision sharpens the threat \u2014 and the potential \u2014 of California\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy law, and could have statewide implications.\nThe local developer behind the applications, Arya Properties LLC \u2014 run by Ali Moayed, a doctor charged with insurance fraud in 2019 and convicted of elder abuse in 2008 \u2014 submitted the projects through the state\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy provision. When a local jurisdiction fails to get state approval on its plan \u2014 known as a housing element \u2014 to make room for additional state-mandated housing supply, builder\u2019s remedy kicks-in. The provision,\nintended as a big stick against noncompliant cities and counties\n,\u00a0 essentially eliminates local zoning rules and standards, and allows developers to propose wildly incongruous and outsized housing projects. The local jurisdictions are often powerless to deny these projects.\nAlas, Los Gatos tried by deeming the project application incomplete. State law allows a 90-day window for developers to cure any issues. On the developer\u2019s second try, Los Gatos again determined the application incomplete. The city interpreted state law to only allow one 90-day window to address application issues, after which an applicant must start all over. The developer argued it had indefinite 90-day windows to resubmit and fix its applications.\nThe court, in an opinion published last week,\nsided with the developer.\nOf course, a 120-foot apartment building would hardly register on the Richter Scale in California\u2019s great metropolises. But think, here, of the scale. Through the state\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy law, Arya Properties LLC was able to submit for housing structures that are about twice as tall as any building standing in Los Gatos. And, now, according to the court, it\u2019s almost impossible to throw these applications out.\nNow, three years into California\u2019s latest cycle of requiring cities and counties to add more housing supply \u2014 and the first in which the state is applying real teeth to its mandates \u2014 the threat and promise of builder\u2019s remedy is becoming clearer. In Pacifica, the peninsula city 10 miles south of San Francisco, a developer is pushing forward on\na new, 86-acre, 1,225-home neighborhood through the builder\u2019s remedy provision\n. In Davis, the 25-acre infill neighborhood, dubbed Palomino Place, recently won approval after employing the state law.\nSan Francisco is watching these developments closely. Late last year, the city council approved\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\n, which upzoned neighborhoods across the city for the first time in decades, aimed at making room for the 82,000 new units the state is requiring San Francisco to permit by 2031. However, groups on both sides of the housing debate \u2014 those who think the upzoning went too far, and those who believe it didn\u2019t go far enough \u2014 have sued the city on those grounds.\nIf a court rules the zoning plan void, it could put San Francisco out of compliance with state housing mandates and trigger builder\u2019s remedy.\nLurie has previously warned what builder\u2019s remedy in San Francisco could mean.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll put towers everywhere,\u201d Lurie said of developers.\nBill Fulton, publisher of the California Planning and Development Report, which tracks land use issues throughout the state, told The Real Deal that builder\u2019s remedy can often tempt developers\u2019 egos.\n\u201cSome developers fall into the trap of their egos with builder\u2019s remedy,\u201d Fulton said over the phone this week. \u201cThey think, \u2018I\u2019m going to build the greatest project ever.\u2019 I think there is a lot of ego, but a lot of developers want to play ball with their city. But others want to go nuclear.\u201d\nCalifornia has not seen many builder\u2019s remedy projects break ground, often due to macro economic factors like the cost of debt and construction materials. However, Fulton said the state is likely to only see builder\u2019s remedy projects crop up where the rents are high, because the law requires developers to pay prevailing wages in the construction of the projects.\nThe state has recently shown an interest in pushing builder\u2019s remedy projects as well. In 2025, AB 1893 went into effect, lowering the affordability thresholds for developers from 20 percent to 13 percent, while also limiting how far a project\u2019s proposed density could go beyond local zoning rules.\n",

Now, the high-volume Austin Realtor is making a foray into hotel development.\nVadakkan, who leads Trinity Texas Realty, is developing two limited-service hotels through his new company, Trinity Texas Hospitality, with projects underway in the Austin and Dallas areas totaling roughly $44 million, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Austin hotel, priced at about $26 million, is expected to start construction in April near Samsung\u2019s massive semiconductor plant in Northeast Austin near East Palmer Lane and East Yager Lane. An $18 million hotel is already underway in McKinney, north of Dallas. That hotel will be a dual-branded La Quinta and Hawthorn Suites adjacent to McKinney ISD Stadium and offer about 100 rooms.\nThe pivot comes as\nresidential brokerage sales\nslowed after years of pandemic-era velocity. Vadakkan\u2019s team ranked second in the Austin Business Journal\u2019s 2025 list of\ntop Realtor teams\n, posting $121 million in sales in 2024, but he said deal flow has softened enough to push him toward more diversified income streams.\n\u201cI have to pay salaries,\u201d Vadakkan told the publication. \u201cOnly doing residential brokerage does not work for me.\u201d\nHe\u2019s hardly the first agent to look\nbeyond commissions\n, as across Texas and other Sun Belt markets, brokers with capital and deal experience have increasingly branched into development, private lending and property ownership to smooth out cyclical swings, the outlet reported. Vadakkan said\nhospitality offered scale\nand longer-term stability.\nFinancing and permitting proved to be the biggest hurdles, he told the outlet. Both hotel projects are backed by Louisiana National Bank, and Vadakkan credited his internal management team with helping navigate unfamiliar territory. The hotels add to a growing portfolio under the Trinity Group umbrella of companies, which already includes a property management arm and a broadcast channel \u2014 Flowers TV USA \u2014 which Vadakkan markets to Indian nationals living both in the United States and abroad.\nVadakkan said that he is already in early planning stages for another Austin-area hotel and eventually wants to move into low-income housing development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The total marks the most weekly contract signings for homes asking eight figures since October 2024.\nA new condo at\n1122 Madison Avenue\nfrom Legion Investment Group and Nahla Capital contributed four contracts for homes in that price tier last week alone, and has already sold half of its 26 units at an asking price of almost $4,300 per foot since launching sales off of floor plans less than a month ago.\nIn total, there were 22 deals signed for condos, seven for co-ops and six for townhouses, along with one for a condop for a total contract volume of over $370 million. The\nweek prior\nsaw 33 contracts signed for almost $313 million.\nThe top contract last week went to two\n78th-floor units\nat 432 Park Avenue.\nThe units had been at the center of a lawsuit between the building\u2019s sponsor, CIM Group, and is developer, Harry Macklowe. A buyer agreed to pay $53 million for units 78A and 78B, which combine to span the entire 78th floor, two sources familiar with the deal\ntold The Real Deal\n. Macklowe lost the properties last year after defaulting on the loans he had taken out from CIM to purchase the condos.\nSpanning 8,300 square feet, the 78th floor is divided into two units that can be combined, or maintained separately.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis and Nicholas Compagnone had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract went to Unit 4N at 140 Jane Street, which was asking $27 million, up from its original price of $21 million.\nSpanning almost 4,600 square feet, the condo includes four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. The home also includes a stone-floored room with sliding glass doors that open onto a Juliet balcony.\nThe primary suite features two dressing rooms and a great room with nearly 10-foot ceilings has views of the Hudson River.\nA Corcoran Sunshine team, led by Tara King-Brown, is heading sales at the Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 project. There is now only one unit left at the 14-unit development. The project inked a contract for a penthouse\nasking $87.5 million last year\n, which would be the most expensive condo sold downtown if it closes for that price.\nHomes that went into contract last week had a median asking price of $7.4 million and an average discount of 5 percent.\n",

        "content": "Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty picked up three agents across Chicago and the wealthy suburban North Shore in recent weeks, adding to its headcount as the city\u2019s\ntop firms wrestle for talent\nin a consolidating market.\nSpencer Terry returned to the brokerage\u2019s Chicago City Hub office to co-found a new team, Echelon Partners, alongside Landon Heck, according to Jameson Sotheby\u2019s. Rory Mone is joining the City Hub from Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago, while Amanda Zick is joining the team at the firm\u2019s upcoming Winnetka office, the company said.\nAmalgamation across the brokerage industry has driven competition for technology, access to listings and local support throughout the industry, and brokerages have been pushed to prove their value to agents.\nThe recruitment drive comes in the wake of Compass\u2019\nmegamerger with Anywhere Real Estate\n, which brought Anywhere\u2019s brands \u2014 including Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 under Compass\u2019 ownership.\nThe agents said that merger was not a factor in their decision to join Jameson Sotheby\u2019s, which is an independently owned franchise of Sotheby\u2019s and is expected to keep a distinct brand. Terry, who was previously with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s for two years before moving to Compass in March 2025, said he doesn\u2019t know if Jameson Sotheby\u2019s will be adopting Compass\u2019 technology, but that having access to the tools of his former brokerage would be a welcome addition.\nCompass CEO Robert Reffkin has said independent franchises will have access to Compass\u2019 technology platform if they want it.\n\u201cAny additional technology or tools that will benefit my clients and make my life easier, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Terry said.\nTerry said he returned to Jameson because the brokerage\u2019s focus on luxury services across price points fits well with his and Heck\u2019s goals with Echelon Partners. The team has three additional agents, Terry said.\n\u201cLandon and I like that whole luxury service, fine dining approach to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to build a team that was big on mentorship and not just on building a business for a team lead\u2019s brand.\u201d\nTerry closed $10 to $11 million in sales last year, he said, and Heck closed about $19 million. Combined, they have about $100 million in sales volume with a combined 17 years of experience, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s said in its press release.\nFor Zick, joining Jameson Sotheby\u2019s\nWinnetka office\nwas an opportunity to get in on the \u201cground floor\u201d of the company\u2019s push into the high-demand North Shore town. The firm opened a new Lake Forest office this month and is planning to open offices in Winnetka and Glenview this year. The firm\nhired Megan Mawicke\nto lead its Winnetka office last year.\nZick was previously at @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, where she was part of a team, and she was at Compass before that. A former teacher at the New Trier school system, Zick began selling real estate full-time last year, she said, when she closed about $4 million in transaction volume. At Jameson Sotheby\u2019s she will be a solo agent.\nThe brokerage\u2019s focus on personalized service, along with its international reach, appealed to her.\n\u201cI really like their marketing and how they provide a boutique experience for clients,\u201d Zick said. \u201cIt aligns well with how I like to do my business, giving a very personal, individually tailored experience for each client.\u201d\nSotheby\u2019s global network was also a big deal for Mone, who joined Jameson from Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago last month. Originally from Ireland, Mone said he\u2019s been contacted about property in Dublin through the Sotheby\u2019s office there in his first couple weeks with the firm.\n\u201cI just wanted to clear a way for myself for the next step and grow my business, and Jameson sort of fit that role with the leadership, resources,\u201d he said.\nMone has a background as a contractor and in property management, and he\u2019s been working as a real estate broker for 10 years. He closed about $6 million in transaction volume last year, he said.\nOther\ncompetitors have been flexing\ntheir appeal to agents through recruiting in recent weeks as well.\nBaird &amp; Warner, Chicago\u2019s largest independent brokerage, picked up Steve Jasinski from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago and the Gerber Diaz Group from Compass in late 2025.\nMeanwhile, Compass added the Cohen Morsch team, formerly of Cross Street, to the brokerage last month.\n",

The building sits on nearly 9 acres.\nColliers represented the seller, and according to its marketing materials, the property was 51 percent occupied. Colliers\u2019 David Carter and Kolbe Curtice had the listing.\nThe three-story, 160,000-square-foot building was constructed in 2007 and has been lender-owned since Independent Bank bought it in an $18.25 million credit bid at a foreclosure sale in 2022, according to the deed.\nHouston-based Fuller Realty Interests was the previous owner, having purchased the property in 2014 for $26.2 million with a $22.75 million loan from Independent Bank. The loan was modified at least five times before the foreclosure sale.\nThe sale comes about a year after McKinley Homes entered the Texas market with the acquisition of Houston-based Liberty Home Builders. At the time, McKinley Homes said it would operate out of the former Liberty office, at 2821 Jordens Road.\nMcKinley Homes\u2019 Jinsong Yang said the company plans to occupy part of the building, making the transaction part of the growing\nowner-occupier office trend\nin Houston. Increasingly, office users are taking advantage of the city\u2019s sluggish office market by purchasing cheap or distressed property instead of renting.\nSuch buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the\nHouston office market in 2025\n, according to Partners Real Estate. That includes the area\u2019s\nsecond-largest office sale\nof the year, in which Dallas-based midstream energy giant Energy Transfer bought the building formerly known as Marathon Oil Tower, at 5555 San Felipe Street, from Starwood Property Trust in April. Starwood took control of the tower in 2022 after prior owner M-M Properties defaulted on an $88 million loan.\n",

        "content": "A proposed apartment tower in Fulton Market is testing how far Chicago is willing to stretch downtown zoning, as well as whether the city will risk undermining a development program that\u2019s steered tens of millions of dollars to South and West Side neighborhoods.\nUp for a vote at the Feb. 19 Chicago Plan Commission meeting is a 29-story, 347-unit apartment building at\n215 North Racine Avenue\n, according to an agenda posted online. The project is being pitched by a venture led by Chicago-based Domus Real Estate Group, which filed its zoning application last spring, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nOn its face, the building wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Fulton Market, where high-rise apartments have followed waves of office, hotel and restaurant development. The flashpoint is that\nDomus\nis seeking DX-16 base zoning \u2014 the densest classification in the city and the same designation that underpins Chicago\u2019s tallest Loop skyscrapers.\nThat request alarmed planning experts and neighborhood groups who said it would upend the zoning framework that has guided Fulton Market\u2019s transformation over the past decade, according to the publication. More critically, DX-16 comes with no cap on bonus density, opening the door to much larger towers and allowing developers to bypass payments into the city\u2019s Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus fund.\n\u201cThat would open the floodgates for everyone else,\u201d Eleanor Esser Gorski, a former planning department official who helped write Fulton Market\u2019s design guidelines and now leads the Chicago Architecture Center, told the outlet. \u201cI would be shocked if this would be allowed.\u201d\nUnder zoning rules adopted in 2017, the Fulton Market Innovation District generally allowed base zoning up to DX-5, with developers able to buy additional density through the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus fund. The Chicago City Council has since\napproved projects\nwith base zoning as high as DX-7, paired with bonuses that push total density to a multiplier of 11.5.\nSince 2017,\nFulton Market developers\nhave paid roughly $83 million into the bonus fund, according to city data, with more committed by projects that haven\u2019t yet broken ground. Most of that cash is routed to grants for small businesses in South and West Side neighborhoods, with a portion earmarked for infrastructure and landmark projects.\nDX-16 would short-circuit that pipeline, the outlet reported. Critics warn developers could rework existing approvals or pursue new projects with far higher as-of-right density, vaporizing future bonus payments and straining infrastructure in a district already under pressure.\nA Plan Commission recommendation would send the project to the City Council Zoning Committee and then the full council, which typically follows the commission\u2019s lead. But the proposal is already pitting Alderman Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett, whose ward includes the site, against neighborhood groups and some planners.\nBurnett told the outlet that the objection isn\u2019t the building itself, but the precedent. He argued Fulton Market needs more family-sized units and flexibility to evolve, calling opposition rooted in \u201ctechnicalities of zoning.\u201d\nIn a statement, Domus\u2019 managing director, Phillip Ciaccio, said the firm worked with stakeholders and touted a sizable Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus payment, affordable units and a publicly accessible park planned for a separate site nearby. The statement did not directly address the DX-16 request.\nThe West Central Association Chamber of Commerce wasn\u2019t convinced. In a January letter to Burnett, the group said the zoning would be inconsistent with the neighborhood\u2019s established scale and vision.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Another apartment complex in Santana Row has traded hands in the second such deal in the San Jose mixed-use neighborhood in the past year.\nChicago-based Waterton\nbought\nMisora, a 212-unit luxury residential property between Olin Avenue and Olsen Drive, for $148.5 million, the Mercury News reported. Federal Realty Investment Trust, the principal developer and owner of Santana Row, was the seller.\nThe deal works out to $700,500 per unit, a sign of strength for Santana Row compared to other South Bay multifamily properties that have commanded lower per-unit prices in recent transactions. Last May, Federal Realty\nsold Levare\n, a 108-unit apartment building at 3003 Olin Avenue in Santana Row, to Hines for $73.9 million, or $684,300 per unit.\nLast month, the 336-unit\nFay apartment tower\nin downtown San Jose was foreclosed on due to a loan default; the lender for the development assigned a property value of $110 million, or $327,400 per unit, to the building. Last September, Stockbridge Capital Group\nsold the 230-unit Linq apartment complex\nin San Jose for $97.6 million, or $424,000 per unit. That same month,\nGreystar sold\nthe 948-unit Park Kiely complex in San Jose for $370 million, or $390,295 per unit.\nWaterton\nis planning to revamp\nMisora\nunder its ownership. Units will get new vinyl plank flooring, lighting and plumbing fixtures as well as quartz countertops, new backsplashes and stainless steel appliances.\nSantana Row has seen a surge in demand for housing driven by the tech sector in the \u201chigh-barrier-to-entry district,\u201d Ben Slack, Waterton\u2019s director of acquisitions, said, predicting continued \u201cfavorable market dynamics and strong supply-demand fundamentals\u201d in the region. Chicago-based Waterton now owns 920 apartment units in the Bay Area.\nFederal Realty isn\u2019t done building new apartment complexes at Santana Row. Last year, the Maryland-based firm began construction of a 258-unit apartment complex at\n358 Hatton Street\n, across Hatton Street from Misora. That project marks Federal Realty\u2019s first new residential development in a decade. The decision to sell Misora is part of the company\u2019s ongoing strategy of \u201cpruning [and] reinvesting\u201d its real estate portfolio, Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rather than hire an agent for project sales or\nproperty acquisitions\n, Amaya can now directly represent Crescent as a listing agent for the company\u2019s spec mansions, and as a buyer\u2019s agent for land purchases, he said.\nCrescent Estates Custom Homes is the luxury homebuilding division of Flower Mound-based Centurion American, Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s prolific development company. Crescent\u2019s high-profile single-family developments include a\ngroup of homes\nbuilt on land that formerly belonged to the Crespi Estate on Walnut Hill Lane in Dallas.\nAmaya joined the company nine years ago as a sales representative after befriending Moayedi, who encouraged him to get his real estate license. He was promoted to vice president of Crescent three years ago.\nHis career sales volume exceeds $200 million, according to Amaya.\nCrescent Estates also started work last year on\nThe Residences at Creek Hollow\n, a $35 million, 31-unit luxury townhome project near Marsh Lane in Dallas, and recently completed the Water\u2019s Edge Condominiums on Lewisville Lake in Dallas. Sales are underway for\nThe Residences at Routh\n, a luxury condo project that Crescent developed at 3610 Routh Street, also in Dallas.\nElsewhere in Texas, Douglas Elliman recently poached top Houston luxury agent\nDana Johnson\nfrom Compass, and brought on Aspen agent\nTommy Kanarellis\nto sell the Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston. Douglas Elliman lost Austin agent\nMichael Reisor\nto Compass last month.\nNationally,\nDouglas Elliman suffered from several high-profile personnel losses\nlast year, including executives Scott Durken and Richard Lampen.\nCrescent Estates is in the process of rezoning 4 acres in Dallas for a single-family development of 42 homes, Amaya said.\n",

        "content": "The Fort Worth Stockyards\u2019 development group is moving forward with a $30 million renovation of two of the district\u2019s most recognizable properties, even as a much larger expansion plan remains in limbo.\nStockyards Heritage Development Company, a partnership between California-based Majestic Realty and Fort Worth-based Hickman Companies, said it will begin renovations of the Historic Stockyards Hotel and the adjacent H3 Ranch restaurant this spring, according to company statements. The project marks the first major development announcement in the Stockyards since turmoil last year upended leadership overseeing the district\u2019s growth, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe hotel and restaurant are slated to close April 6. Officials told the outlet that they could reopen as soon as late this year, though early 2027 is also on the table. The renovation will focus on kitchen and back-of-house upgrades and a refreshed dining room, a more modest scope than earlier redevelopment pitches.\nMajestic and Hickman acquired the\nStockyards Hotel\nbuilding in 2022, including H3 Ranch and Booger Red\u2019s Saloon. The 118-year-old hotel has 42 rooms and 10 suites and has long leaned into its outlaw-and-country-music lore. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow reportedly hid out there in 1933, and the hotel\u2019s\ncelebrity suite\nhas hosted Willie Nelson, George Strait and Garth Brooks.\n\u201cThe decision to renovate was made with great care and respect for what these properties represent,\u201d the partnership\u2019s COO Kristin Assad told the outlet, framing the work as preservation with an operational upgrade.\nThe renovation moves ahead as broader plans for the Stockyards appear paused. In 2024, the Fort Worth City Council approved an economic development agreement with\nMajestic\nand Hickman that envisioned nearly doubling the size of the Historic Stockyards. The deal contemplated 300,000 square feet of commercial space, hotels totaling at least 500 rooms, a 295-unit multifamily project and two underground garages with 1,300 spaces by 2032.\nThat second phase has yet to advance.\nMajestic\nrecently tapped Rick Kline to oversee the Stockyards after a public split with former development head Craig Cavileer. Kline said the partners remain committed to future development, but are taking a \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cappropriately-timed\u201d approach to undeveloped land.\nCity officials said discussions with the new leadership are ongoing, but there\u2019s no update on when the expansion might restart. Fort Worth Stockyards President Paul Paine said confidence remains high, noting the proposed buildout could top $1 billion.\nHovering over it all is a legal fight between Majestic and Cavileer playing out in Los Angeles County Superior Court, involving dueling claims tied to tens of millions of dollars in promissory notes and ownership stakes. A trial is currently scheduled for October, though legal experts said delays are likely.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities has completed\nits sale of the Sunset Towers\napartments in the Inner Sunset.\nThe Virginia-based firm\nsold\nthe 243-unit property to Bridge Capital Partners and Friedkin Property Group for $105 million, the San Francisco Business Times reported, citing sources familiar with the deal.\nAvalonBay\nfielded higher offers from other firms for the property, which is three blocks south of Golden Gate Park, according to the Business Times. The deal for the six-decade-old development works out to about $432,000 per unit, meaning Bridge and Friedkin were willing to pay a relatively high price for an aging property. The Sunset Towers were built in 1961 and renovated in the mid-1990s. Because older high-rises often require more work than newer properties for owners to bring them up to code, Sunset Towers will likely need to undergo building-wide upgrades, though the cost for such modernization remains unclear, according to the Business Times.\nThe timing of the sale coincides with an apparent comeback in the San Francisco rental market. Rents are increasing with year-over-year growth at about 13 percent, per Apartment List data cited by the Business Times. In September, rents in San Francisco\nsurpassed pre-pandemic highs\n\u2014 a culmination of a nearly two-year-long upswing that began in mid-2024 after reaching a post-pandemic bottom. The rent surge, reaching a monthly median of $3,520 for a one-bedroom and $5,000 for a two-bedroom in September, has been attributed to limited new apartment supply and rising demand as more tech and artificial intelligence firms set up shop or expand their presence in the city.\nMeanwhile, multifamily investment volume is up more than 35 percent year-over-year, per Avison Young data\ncited\nby the Business Times. Investors have been focusing on existing properties in supply-constrained neighborhoods such as the Inner Sunset as few new market-rate projects emerge and many are paused as construction costs mount. More than\n20,000 units\nin San Francisco are waiting to be built as projects face years of delays or fall apart entirely. Last year, only 1,453 residential units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Planning Department.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bondholders tied to the\nAmerican Dream megamall\nare accusing its owners and a North Jersey borough of playing valuation games that torpedoed the collateral behind roughly $800 million in municipal debt.\nIn a lawsuit filed in Bergen County chancery court, U.S. Bank Trust, acting as trustee for bondholders led by Nuveen, alleged that the Borough of East Rutherford and mall owner Triple Five Group colluded to slash the assessed value of the 3.5 million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex, according to\nBloomberg\n. The cuts, bondholders say, have left annual payments covering less than half of the interest owed on the bonds.\nAt the center of the dispute is American Dream\u2019s assessment, which dropped sharply over the past year.\nAfter carrying a valuation between roughly $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion from 2019 through 2024, the borough lowered the figure last year to $2.5 billion. A New Jersey tax court judge then reduced it again, to\nabout $1.65 billion\n. Because bond payments are tied to the mall\u2019s assessed value, the reductions flowed directly through to investors.\nThe bonds are backed by payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs, a structure frequently used in New Jersey to finance large developments. American Dream\u2019s PILOT bonds were part of a $1.1 billion tax-exempt financing package that helped bankroll the long-delayed mall, which includes an indoor ski slope, water park and amusement park adjacent to MetLife Stadium.\nBondholders claim the process behind the new valuation was anything but neutral. American Dream pressured East Rutherford to replace its longtime appraiser with a less experienced firm that produced a \u201cdramatically reduced\u201d appraisal, according to the bondholders. The borough and the mall\u2019s owners then ensured the valuation lacked sufficient data to withstand scrutiny in tax court, the suit alleges.\nThe incentives, bondholders argue, were skewed from the start. East Rutherford receives its share of the PILOT payments before bondholders, regardless of the mall\u2019s valuation, insulating the town from the downside.\nThe American Dream mall, meanwhile, benefits directly from a lower assessment through reduced payments, according to the suit.\nNuveen holds nearly 90 percent of the outstanding PILOT bonds, amplifying the stakes of the case for the municipal market.\nA spokesman for American Dream did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\nand East Rutherford officials also did not respond to Bloomberg.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "More than four years after putting a $3 million deposit on an unfinished penthouse in disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor\u2019s first luxury condominium project, a stranded condo buyer is still fighting to recoup its funds.\nThe condo buyer, Mironrest CG, objected to court-appointed receiver Bernice Lee seeking to hire her own law firm to handle clawback litigation.\nIt\u2019s the latest kerfuffle in the ongoing liquidation saga of\nLocation Ventures\n, the defunct Coral Gables firm founded by\nKapoor\n.\nLee and Mironest CG attorney Jonathan Minsker declined comment.\nThe proposed contingency fee for Kozyak Tropin &amp; Throckmorton, where she is a partner, is \u201cexcessive and unreasonable,\u201d Miami-based Mironest CG said in a motion filed last month. The stranded condo buyer wants U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Becerra to reject Lee\u2019s request.\nLee is seeking approval to hire the Kozyak firm for a fee based on 27 percent to 33 percent of any gross proceeds from clawback lawsuits and settlements, court filings show.\nLee\nwas appointed receiver of Location Ventures shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Kapoor, his firm and its affiliates for fraud.\nKapoor was accused of misappropriating\n$93 million\nin investor funds meant for his real estate projects, most of which fell apart as Location Ventures imploded in a tsunami of lawsuits and investigations, including probes by the FBI and IRS, according to published reports.\nThe SEC settled its claims against\nKapoor\nin November 2024, after he agreed to conditions including not serving as an officer or director of a company with securities for five years.\nSince then, Lee has focused on selling off Location Ventures\u2019 properties, including a Miami Beach development site for\n$17.5 million\n. Most recently, the receiver sought approval to sell an unfinished mixed-use project in Coconut Grove to a lender with a\n$27.4 million\ncredit bid.\nMironest CG\u2019s condo deposit\nKapoor\u2019s Location Ventures completed most of Villa Valencia in the summer of 2022. The 13-story Coral Gables building with 39 units represented the then-six-year-old firm\u2019s first luxury condominium project.\nBut despite obtaining a certificate of occupancy, the developer left three penthouses at Villa Valencia unfinished, including a top-floor unit that\nMironest CG\nagreed to purchase for $6 million, the buyer\u2019s motion states.\nThe true identity of Mironest CG\u2019s owner is unknown. State corporate records only list the registered agent, Miami-based law firm Pardo Jackson Gainesburg. The name of Mironest CG\u2019s authorized representative is redacted in a copy of the purchase agreement. The entity is among dozens of investors, buyers and vendors that have sued Location Ventures and its affiliates in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nGeneral contractor accusations\nMironest CG alleges in its motion that Location Ventures\u2019 general contractor for Villa Vallencia, Winmar Construction, assisted in \u201cthe diversion of millions of dollars,\u201d including billing $10 million for work on the penthouses while only actually completing $2.2 million in work.\nLocation Ventures allegedly siphoned $93.9 million in sale proceeds from Villa Valencia\u2019s completed units as a \u201cpiggy bank for the fraud \u2026 to arbitrarily repay lenders and for other projects,\u201d the motion states.\nMironest CG alleges its deposit was used as collateral for loans provided by Location Ventures insiders.\nWhen Mironest CG pressured Location Ventures to finish its penthouse, the developer told the buyer it needed to pay an additional $1.4 million directly to Winmar to complete the build-out, the motion states.\n\u201cBeing unaware of the fraud, and eager to move from rented accommodations into their new home,\u201d the funds were wired, the motion states. \u201cSadly, even though the wires were sent to Winmar, they still essentially evaporated.\u201d\nWinmar CEO Edwin Vallegas did not respond to requests for comment.\nMironest CG\u2019s objections\nLee\u2019s investigation is likely to recover tens of millions of dollars from Winmar and other Location Ventures insiders, the motion alleges.\nHowever, the proposed contingency fee structure for Lee\u2019s law firm \u201cwould be manifestly unreasonable and harmful to the estate\u2019s innocent stakeholders\u201d if any funds obtained via claw back measures are not enough to repay claims by Mronest CG and others, the motion states.\nThe contingency is \u201calmost certain to result in a windfall fee of tens of millions of dollars to\u201d Lee\u2019s firm, while reducing by approximately one-third the remaining proceeds available to satisfy claims by Mironest CG and other plaintiffs, the motion states.\nMironest CG alleges that Lee failed to obtain proposals from other qualified law firms and failed to explore other options such as litigation financing. To avoid an appearance of a potential conflict of interest, Lee \u201cshould be required to explore the market for alternative firms, fee structures and financing options,\u201d the motion states.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority quietly reversed course on a move to permanently bar the daughter of a longtime board commissioner from doing business with the agency, reopening the door to future contracts after an internal fight over procurement rules and ethics.\nThe contractor, Lovie Diggs, faced what CHA officials initially deemed permanent debarment after she was arrested, charged and later pleaded guilty in a criminal case, according to agency records and Cook County court documents. An investigation by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times first\nreported\nthat after Diggs\u2019 attorney appealed directly to CHA leadership, the housing authority scrapped the debarment altogether.\nDiggs\u2019 firm, Lavi Decor and Cleaning Company, has been paid more than $1 million by the CHA. Diggs is the daughter of\nDebra Parker\n, a CHA board commissioner since 2018. Both outlets reported last fall that Diggs was one of three\nCHA contractors\nwith close personal ties to Parker. The other two companies are owned by Parker\u2019s sister and her longtime boyfriend, and together the three businesses have collected nearly $22 million from the agency.\nThe Diggs case stems from a February 2023 arrest in which prosecutors accused her of using another woman\u2019s identity to obtain more than $5,000 in merchandise from a Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture store, according to the publications. In 2024, Diggs pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge as part of a deal that dropped a felony identity theft count. She was sentenced to probation, which she later completed.\nCHA Inspector General Kathryn Richards concluded the case triggered grounds for permanent debarment under agency policy, which allows bans for conduct involving fraud, theft or deception. In July, CHA\u2019s contracting department formally notified Diggs that it intended to bar her \u2014 and any company she owns or controls \u2014 from future CHA work.\nDiggs\u2019 attorney pushed back, arguing she was never convicted of a felony and that her case was discharged without a formal conviction. Internal emails show\nCHA lawyers\ninitially floated an 18-month voluntary suspension as a compromise. Days later, the agency abandoned enforcement entirely.\n\u201cCHA has decided to cancel the proposed debarment proceedings,\u201d Deputy Chief Procurement Officer Sheila Johnson wrote in an Oct. 30 letter, allowing Diggs to continue participating in\nCHA programs\nwithout interruption.\nNeither Diggs, Parker nor Richards provided comment to the publication. CHA board chair Matthew Brewer and agency spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a report issued last month, the inspector general said Diggs\u2019 guilty plea still ran afoul of procurement rules and noted court transcripts showed she acknowledged using another person\u2019s identification to obtain goods. Richards also flagged broader concerns about favoritism tied to Parker\u2019s family and associates.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence companies are warning Illinois lawmakers that the state risks losing billions of dollars in data center investment unless it loosens the nation\u2019s toughest biometric privacy law \u2014 a threat that\u2019s colliding with deep skepticism from labor unions, environmentalists and suburban communities.\nAt the center of the fight is Illinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA, a 2008 law that gives individuals the right to sue companies for improperly collecting or using biometric data such as facial images, fingerprints or retina scans. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat industry groups argue the statute creates unlimited legal exposure for AI-driven data centers, which increasingly rely on biometric data to train algorithms and power everything from facial recognition to targeted advertising.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing billions of dollars of investment that Illinois is just not even in the running for,\u201d said Brad Tietz, state policy director for the Data Center Coalition, whose members include Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta.\nIn Indiana, for instance, Amazon is spending $26 billion on a massive cluster of AI data centers near South Bend, while Wisconsin and Indiana are rapidly\noutpacing Illinois\nin planned hyperscale projects. Illinois currently has 108 data centers of all sizes, nearly twice as many as Indiana and Wisconsin combined, according to Baxtel data cited by the publication. But looking ahead, Indiana has 37 large-scale projects planned or under construction, compared with just five in Illinois through 2032.\nDevelopers say BIPA is a key reason. Unlike other states, Illinois allows private lawsuits and statutory damages for biometric violations, and companies could be liable each time a person\u2019s image or data is reused for a new purpose, according to the outlet. Since 2020, Meta, Google and TikTok\u2019s parent have paid a combined $842 million to settle Illinois privacy claims.\nOpposition to changing the law is fierce. Trial lawyers call BIPA a critical civil rights safeguard. Environmental groups want stricter rules on data center power consumption, water use and diesel backup generators. Local officials, meanwhile, are facing resident backlash over noise, traffic and infrastructure strain.\nThose tensions are already playing out on the ground in the Chicago suburbs. Aurora enacted a temporary moratorium on\nnew data centers\nlast fall after noise complaints, while Naperville\u2019s City Council\nrejected\na proposed 145,000-square-foot facility in January. DeKalb County, by contrast, has approved nearly 3 million square feet of data center space tied to Meta and other tech giants, though\nadditional projects\nthere are now on hold amid power constraints and legal uncertainty.\nEnvironmental advocates recently introduced the Power Act, which would raise electricity rates for large data center users and restrict where facilities can be built. Industry groups warn the bill would make Illinois an even bigger outlier.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s enough to make any real estate hater burn: Cayre Equities just sold 254 West 35th Street for 62 percent more than they had paid just 14 months before, as my colleague Liz Cryan\nreported\n.\nThe key to the $10 million increase was that between the purchase and the sale, the city\nrezoned Midtown South\n, including Cayre\u2019s Garment District building.\nWhat should we make of this?\nOne thing that real estate\u2019s critics dislike about rezoning is that it adds value to properties. It creates wealth out of thin air for whomever was lucky or smart enough to own a rezoned parcel at the time.\nCritics call buyers of land that might be rezoned \u201cspeculators,\u201d a derogatory term that suggests investors are trying to make money without doing any real work. They also claim property speculation makes the city more expensive.\nThis is stupid on several levels.\nFirst, rezoning is necessary to make the best use of land when circumstances change, as they have in the Garment District. Midtown West is now much more valuable to society as residential or office space than as manufacturing.\nCity politicians resisted rezoning it for decades in a misguided attempt to save textile jobs, but nearly all of those jobs disappeared or moved elsewhere anyway. The government was also slow to rezone manufacturing districts in Long Island City, Gowanus, Inwood and Red Hook.\nSecond, \u201cspeculators\u201d play a useful role in the market by buying properties that someone wants to sell. Markets need liquidity. If Mrs. Jones wants to cash out a longtime family property and retire to Arizona, she needs buyers. To her, they are not speculators, but investors who make her golden years truly golden. (Cayre bought 254 West 35th from\nGonca Chelsea\u2019s LLC\n.)\nThird, every time a property is sold, the city, state and Metropolitan Transportation Authority collect transfer taxes. Critics who believe sales and property upgrades make the city more expensive should consider how much higher their subway fare would be, or if garbage pickup would be free, if not for transfer taxes.\nState and city transfer taxes on sales of $25 million or more range from 1.4 percent to\nalmost 6 percent\n. The Cayre family\u2019s sale of 254 West 35th generated\n$773,665 in transfer taxes\n\u2014 3 percent of the sale. Its purchase in 2024 produced\n$528,912\nin transfer taxes.\nIf you believe the family did nothing to make millions of dollars on its flip, ask yourself what the government did to reap $1.3 million.\nIt doesn\u2019t take zero work to buy and sell a property. The buyer is putting money at risk rather than, say, buying a Treasury note paying a guaranteed 4 percent. Acquiring investment properties involves a lot of due diligence, networking and fundraising from investors, among other things. It takes a lot more time than buying an index fund with a few mouse clicks.\nThe Cayres made a profit, but it could also be called earnings. It\u2019s not passive income. It\u2019s money derived from work.\n",

        "content": "As two long-delayed high-profile projects head to the finish line in Boca Raton, details of the financial and legal problems that slowed their development are coming to light.\nMark Gensheimer\u2019s Penn-Florida unveiled ambitious plans for Boca Raton a decade ago. The firm, already an office owner in the city, was pursuing an assisted living facility. It unveiled plans in 2015 for its marquee Mandarin Oriental condominium and hotel in a gushing news release.\nBut over the past two years, Penn-Florida faced foreclosure suits on two of its office buildings and the assisted living development site, which is vacant. It filed for bankruptcy on the unfinished Mandarin Oriental hotel in December; it has also confronted lawsuits from Mandarin Oriental condo buyers angered by its delayed completion. The branded hotel and condo originally were slated to be finished in 2017. The firm also went through bankruptcy for another project, an apartment building at Via Mizner, its mixed-use Boca development that also includes the branded condos and hotel. It managed to keep a stake in the property after partnering with multifamily syndicator and social media personality Grant Cardone.\nPenn-Florida attributed the woes to post-pandemic headwinds and bad timing for loan maturations.\nIts debts provided low leverage, ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent loan-to-value, and were \u201cin good standing\u201d when they matured, the company said in a statement. But three of the matured debts were purchased by \u201copportunistic\u201d loan buyers who immediately pursued foreclosures \u201choping to take ownership of the properties and realize a significant profit,\u201d though Penn-Florida paid off each debt in full through capital restructuring, refinancing or property sale.\nFor years, record commercial and residential leasing suggested South Florida\u2019s tri-county region was immune to issues facing most other markets. But Penn-Florida\u2019s saga shows the challenges landlords and developers in South Florida now face: retrenching financiers, tighter lending standards and illiquid markets, elevated interest rates and mounting construction and insurance costs \u2013\u2013 all factors Penn-Florida cited for its troubles.\nStill, construction of the Mandarin Oriental condos now is expected to wrap up this year, followed by the hotel shortly after, Penn-Florida said. Not defeated by the distress, the firm has queued up another marquee mixed-use project, University Village.\nThat development, near Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Boca Raton campus, is planned with 829 residential units, including apartments, for-sale homes, an assisted living facility, as well as a hotel, offices, retail space and trails. It obtained master plan approval, and its site plan application is pending.\nHere is more about Penn-Florida\u2019s debt troubles of the past two years.\nMandarin Oriental hotel\nPenn-Florida filed for bankruptcy in December on the\n12-story, 164-key hotel\nthat\u2019s under construction at 103 East Camino Real.\nIts senior secured lender, TIG Romspen US Master Mortgage, provided a $140 million loan in 2021. Penn-Florida defaulted on it at its 2023 maturity, court records show.\nA restructuring agreement in collaboration with its lender calls for the refinancing or sale of the property. Penn-Florida requested approval for the sale procedures last Wednesday, though it said it is doing so out of an abundance of caution in case a refinancing doesn\u2019t work out.\nTIG Romspen is listed as a Cayman Islands limited partnership with an office in Toronto, Canada.\nAmong the unsecured claims listed in the bankruptcy filing is one from Mandarin Oriental in Marietta, Georgia for $502,600 marked as \u201cdisputed.\u201d\nIn Palm Beach Circuit Court, Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate faces lawsuits from five project contractors. The contractors are required by state law to sue \u201cto protect their lien rights,\u201d Penn-Florida said.\nThe hotel is topped off and \u201cstructurally\u201d finished, Penn-Florida said in a December news release about its bankruptcy filing.\nMandarin Oriental condo\nThe 88-unit condo building at 105 East Camino Real hasn\u2019t been the subject of lender foreclosures or Chapter 11 reorganizations.\nThe building, slated for completion this summer, is substantially presold, Penn-Florida\u2019s release says. But the yearslong delays have angered buyers, with eight open\nsuits\nagainst Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed by buyers seeking their deposits back.\nAlthough Penn-Florida declined to comment on the pending litigation, only saying the purchase and sale agreements have been and will be honored, in court filings it has argued that the PSAs made it clear that the developer isn\u2019t obligated to substantially finish the project by the anticipated completion date and that construction may be extended due to unavailability of labor, materials and financing, among other hurdles.\n101 Via Mizner\nThe 14-story, 366-unit apartment building at 101 East Camino Real is the only building Penn-Florida completed at its Via Mizner project.\nThe firm finished the project, called 101 Via Mizner, in 2016.\nPenn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed for\nChapter 11 reorganization\non the property in January of last year, on the same day the property was due to go up for a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction. Blackstone Mortgage Trust previously sought UCC foreclosure on a\n$145 million\nloan.\nPenn-Florida paid off the debt last year after it partnered with Cardone on the\n$235 million\npurchase of the property. Cardone\u2019s affiliate paid $220 million, and Penn-Florida\u2019s entity covered the $15 million balance, according to court filings.\nDespite court records at the time saying the joint venture may convert the rentals into condos, Penn-Florida said there\u2019s no such plan currently.\n101 Via Mizner is more than 90 percent occupied, according to Penn-Florida.\nAssisted living site\nPenn-Florida planned a 193-unit assisted living facility on the 1-acre property at 375 East Royal Palm Road.\nThe firm paid $1.2 million for the site and adjacent properties in 2005, records show.\nIt borrowed $2.5 million on the land in 2016 from City National Bank of Florida, increasing the loan to $5.7 million in three loan modifications in subsequent years.\nIn 2024, City National Bank of Florida reassigned the loan to an affiliate of Miami Beach-based distressed debt investor Safe Harbor Equity, which filed for foreclosure against Penn-Florida on the $5.7 million loan, alleging default on the 2024 maturity. The foreclosure also was against Gensheimer, the loan\u2019s guarantor.\nPenn-Florida demolished the two-story building on the site but never started\nconstruction\nof the assisted living center. It sold the land to Boca Raton-based SobelCo in October for\n$27 million\n, paying its debt and settling the foreclosure.\nBoca Raton offices\nIn 2024, a Penn-Florida affiliate was hit with two foreclosure lawsuits on a pair of Boca Raton office buildings.\nAn affiliate of Kore Capital sued over the $9.6 million balance on three loans for the seven-story, 33,100-square-foot office building at 101 North Federal Highway and the $10.8 million balance on a debt for the the five-story, 40,200-square-foot building at 1 North Federal Highway, according to Palm Beach Circuit Court filings.\nPenn-Florida developed the 101 North Federal Highway building, completing it in 2003, and paid $8.8 million for the 1 North Federal Highway building and surrounding properties, records show.\nKore Capital alleged Penn-Florida defaulted on the maturity of three loans for 101 North Federal, originally issued by City National Bank of Florida in 2016, 2018 and 2020 for $9.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, according to court filings. The lender also alleged Penn-Florida defaulted on the maturity of a $13.8 million loan, originally issued by City National Bank of Florida in 2016.\nBoth suits named Gensheimer as a defendant.\nKore Capital had both suits dismissed in May, after Boca Raton-based real estate investor James Batmasian took over Penn-Florida\u2019s ownership entities for the buildings, according to court and state corporate records. The sale price wasn\u2019t public.\nBatmasian\nleads Investments Limited.\nPenn-Florida said the loans were fully repaid but declined to say how much Batmasian paid for the properties.\n",

The deal is off-market and it is unclear whether brokers are involved.\nThe price will be between $150 million and $200 million, which could set a record for the most expensive single-family home sale in Miami-Dade County history. Cancro bought the 1.8-acre waterfront compound for $37 million in 2021, property records show. He recently completed the mansion on the property, and records have not yet been updated to reflect the square footage and scope of the home.\nThe couple are the latest in a wave of Silicon Valley titans acquiring South Florida homes.\nBillionaires are fleeing California because a\nproposed 5\u202fpercent wealth tax\non fortunes over $1\u202fbillion could hit them with a one\u2011time levy, prompting many to relocate before the Jan.\u202f1 residency cutoff. With wealth estimated at $220 billion, that could cost Zuckerberg $11 billion. Florida\u2019s lack of income tax is among the factors that makes it an attractive choice for residency.\nGoogle co-founder Larry Page recently\ndropped $173 million on a pair\nof waterfront Coconut Grove estates. His co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly home shopping in Miami Beach, and is buying the Allison Island home of LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke.\nStill, Zuckerberg\u2019s purchase is a surprise to some of Miami\u2019s market insiders.\n\u201cThis is one I\u2019m actually shocked by,\u201d said Dina Goldentayer. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him being in the marketplace.\u201d\nThe Douglas Elliman agent is a top broker in Miami\u2019s ultra-luxury market and a veteran of Indian Creek deals \u2014 her client roster there includes Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.\nShe called Zuckerberg\u2019s buy the \u201cprecise consequence\u201d of California\u2019s proposed wealth tax, and a major get for the Miami market.\n\u201cI think we need more actionable owners given the demand that is out there from our hungry California buyers,\u201d she said.\nIndian Creek has proven popular with ultra-luxury buyers in recent years. Known as \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Bunker,\u201d it is a completely private island with its own municipal government and police force.\nBezos has shelled out\n$234 million\non a trio of properties on the island. There has been speculation he was also the buyer of a fourth 1.8 acre estate for\n$105 million\nin June, which is adjacent to two of the lots he already owns.\nIndian Creek sellers are looking to capitalize on the demand for the island\u2019s homes with previously unheard of prices.

The Altman Brothers Team is once again growing with the opening of the group\u2019s third office, located in Rancho Santa Fe.\nThe Douglas Elliman team celebrated the new office\u2019s grand opening on Monday, with the push into San Diego County following 2024\u2019s unveiling of a\nCorona del Mar\noutpost at 3700 East Coast Highway.\nThe newest office, at 6009 Paseo Delicias, is currently lean with Jason Saks the sole agent staffing the office and serving as an area partner for The Altman Brothers. The team confirmed through a brokerage spokesperson the goal is to eventually staff up the office to three agents.\nJosh Altman, who started The Altman Brothers with his brother Matt Altman and formerly starred on\n\u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d\nsaid in a press release on the new office that San Diego is \u201chaving a major moment,\u201d which the new location will look to capitalize on.\nThe past two years saw Saks, along with The Altman Brothers, close on almost $200 million in San Diego County on- and off-market sales.\nSaks and Josh last month listed 3000 Sandy Lane in Del Mar for $49.9 million, or $12,834 per square foot, for the beachfront property. It\u2019s the new office\u2019s most recent listing and brings its total inventory volume for the San Diego market to $160 million. Realty Holdings purchased the property in 2022 for $18.9 million, according to property records, and remodeled the home in the gated community of Sandy Lane before listing it.\nAmong the office\u2019s other sizable listings is 6308 Camino De La Costa in La Jolla, which is asking $35 million, or roughly $3,411 per square foot.\nThe new office will focus on luxury markets within the county, including Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar, La Jolla, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley and Poway.\nBig brand\nThe growth of what Douglas Elliman President and CEO Michael Liebowitz called \u201cone of the most powerful luxury real estate\nbrands\nin the world,\u201d comes after the team closed on a total of more than $1.3 billion in volume last year.\nOn\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s most recent\nrankings\nof Los Angeles County\u2019s top agents and teams for 2025, The Altman Brothers placed fourth with $591.7 million in volume across 88 trades. The rankings are based on on-market deals of $1 million or more between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\nThe Altman Brothers in 2019 opened its first standalone address on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles\u2019 Beverly Grove neighborhood.\nIn August 2024, the team opened its first permanent Corona del Mar office with a 15-year lease for a property once occupied by a bank. The team had earlier operated in a temporary space two blocks away, while the permanent location was being renovated. At the time of the Orange County opening, Josh projected to\nTRD\nthe office would generate around $1 billion in sales annually. He also guessed the office could mature to rival that of Los Angeles, particularly given the absence of a tax in Orange County akin to Measure United to House L.A.\nThe 2022 ballot measure that went into effect in April 2023 applies a 4 percent tax on real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on trades of $10.6 million or more.\n",

Their client portfolio includes institutional owners, Fortune 500 companies and family-owned businesses \u2014 and they\u2019ve dealt with logistics and distribution facilities, manufacturing, last-mile assets and outdoor storage.\nKwak counts a 38-year career as a commercial real estate broker and business owner; McKnight has completed over 200 transactions valued above $600 million; Kolander has seven years of experience and Hayne six.\nThat wasn\u2019t the only move throughout Orange County and Los Angeles\u2019 commercial real estate spaces in recent months.\nKidder Mathews tapped Jonathan Steier as vice president of the company\u2019s Sherman Oaks office. He has 25 years of experience, mostly in retail leasing and investment sales throughout Los Angeles, particularly in the Valley. He has facilitated about $100 million in real estate deals and completed more than 400 leases. He has worked with brands such as Chipotle, Chase and Petco.\nCBRE hired Patrick McGrath as executive managing director of its South Bay office. He\u2019ll lead strategy and operations for the region, and his two-decade long tenure as a senior commercial real estate executive should help. McGrath left Savills where he was chief information officer and president of North America\u2019s West region.\nCommerce Construction Company \u2014 a subsidiary of one of the country\u2019s largest privately owned developers Majestic Realty \u2014 named Ryan Merlette, a 20-year industry veteran, as its new president.

Merlette will lead the design and construction teams responsible for executing and delivering Majestic\u2019s development projects, as well as projects for third-party clients. Merlette began at Commerce Construction in 2017 and served as executive vice president since.\nRetail brokerage Hanley Investment Group, headquartered in Corona Del Mar, promoted three of its team members: Dylan Mallory, who went from senior vice president to executive vice president, and Brad Dessy and Sean Cox, who went from vice presidents to senior vice presidents. All three specialize in the acquisition and disposition of retail properties. Mallory has closed over $300 million in retail property sales since 2020; and Cox has sold over $300 million in retail assets since 2022.\nSanta Monica-based Turner Impact Capital, one of the nation\u2019s largest social impact investment firms that owns real estate throughout the country, announced some elevations, too, of four senior executives to co-head and managing director roles. That includes Brock Miller and Katie Winthrop on housing and Logan Harper and Kate Hirsh on healthcare. Miller will oversee multifamily acquisitions and has held prior roles at Greystar and Goldman Sachs; Winthrop will lead asset management and previously worked at Cohen &amp; Steers; the latter two will focus on healthcare real estate development.\n",

        "content": "Venice\u2019s latest affordable housing project has gotten a funding boost from Los Angeles County, much to the chagrin of the city of Los Angeles that has spent more than $1 million in legal fees fighting its development.\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors\napproved nearly $44 million\nin loans\nfor affordable housing\ndevelopments across the county, including $3 million for Hollywood Community Housing and Venice Community Housing\u2019s Venice Dell project, Palisades News reported. The $3 million injection is in addition to the more than\n$42.5 million\nthat the California Department of Housing and Community Development committed to the development.\nWhen complete, Venice Dell will consist of low-rise buildings containing 120 apartments and ground-floor retail on a 2.7-acre parking lot at Venice Boulevard and Pacific Avenue. Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the Venice Dell site, announced the funding allocation last week. The Los Angeles City Council first approved the project in 2021, and in 2024, the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission\ngranted a coastal development permit after years of review and legal challenges given its proximity to the beach.\nDespite the approvals, including from the City Council itself, the project still hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground. The city has spent more than $1 million on outside legal counsel fees related to the project; recent allocations include $650,000 through March. The office of city attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto has continued to seek additional funding for litigation, including a $760,000 request at the top of this year.\nTraci Park, who represents the area on the City Council, has derided the Venice Dell project over concerns about parking loss, coastal access and overall cost. Last October, the City Council began looking into converting the Los Angeles Department of Transportation-owned parking lot at the site into a mobility hub while studying relocating Venice Dell to another nearby parcel.\nHorvath, meanwhile, has criticized the city\u2019s legal spending, including the $650,000 set aside for outside counsel fees through March. \u201cThe city has now spent over $1 million fighting\naffordable housing\nprojects,\u201d Horvath said, per Palisades News. \u201cWhile they\u2019re fighting housing, we\u2019re funding it.\u201d The city\u2019s total outside counsel fees related to such projects including Venice Dell exceed $2.5 million, the supervisor said. \u201cIt is ridiculous to spend taxpayer dollars to oppose a project that has been approved at every level of government, even by the Coastal Commission,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cIt is time for the city to get out of its own way and allow Venice Dell to move forward.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project also calls for turning a parking garage south of the existing offices into a new five-story, 81-unit residential structure. The developer would provide parking for 55 vehicles across the two buildings.\nThe plans, recently considered by the City of Pasadena\u2019s\nDesign Commission\n, include a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments for low- and moderate-income households, but for two units reserved for on-site property managers. In Los Angeles County, low-income is generally\ndefined\nas one person making below $84,850 annually, or $121,150 for a household of four. Moderate-income individuals make below $89,550, while households of four make $127,900.\nFSY Architects is designing the renovated buildings. The blueprints call for updating the existing 1966 office building with new operable windows and open spaces for residents. The proposal was presented to the Design Commission for preliminary review but has yet to secure approval.\nUnder its housing element, the City of Pasadena must plan for 9,429 new residential units by 2029.\nElysian Housing has another sizable project underway on the other side of L.A. County: an affordable housing complex in Warner Center in the west\nSan Fernando Valley\n. In October, the company filed an application with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning for The Green, a seven-story building with 316 one, two- and three-bedroom apartments on a 120,000-square-foot lot at 21155 Califa Street. Like Elysian Housing\u2019s endeavor in Pasadena, The Green will be reserved entirely for low- and moderate-income renters, minus two manager\u2019s units on site. That project will be part of\nWarner Center\u2019s transformation\ninto a mixed-use district anchored by affordable housing. Last week,\nWellpointe acquired\na 4.7-acre site at 6400 Canoga Avenue from Sandstone Properties with plans for a 100 percent affordable housing development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Presidio Bay acquired the property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, according to San Francisco Assessor-Recorder documents cited by the Business Times.\nThe deal works out to $500 per square foot, making it one of the higher-priced office sales to close in San Francisco in recent years. The price could be attributed to the San Francisco Department of Public Health\u2019s long-term lease in the building, the Business Times reported, citing local market sources. The city occupies 80 percent of the building and still has about a decade left on its lease, according to JLL, which brokered 333 Valencia\u2019s sale.\nPresidio Bay plans to \u201cactivate [333 Valencia\u2019s] ground floor to meet near-term neighborhood needs while contributing to the long-term revitalization of San Francisco\u2019s commercial corridors,\u201d founder\nK.

The group began marketing the building for sale the year prior with a $60 million pricing guidance, the Registry\nreported\n, though its final list price is unclear. The ownership group invested more than $20 million revamp 333 Valencia, while the city of San Francisco invested an additional $6.4 million to upgrade its space in the building.\nPresidio Bay didn\u2019t shy away from downtown San Francisco in the post-pandemic years when many investors were initially wary of acquiring assets in the city. In August 2023, the firm bought\n60 Spear Street\nfor $41 million, or about $260 per square foot, which helped reset office building values in the city and laid the groundwork for\nits ongoing comeback\n, according to the Business Times.

The deals follow a renovation project at the property, in which the landlord added a new gym and updated conference facilities.\nMack Allen\u2019s\n, a restaurant from Houston restaurateur Mack McDonald, will open on the ground floor of 5 Post Oak Park this year. The restaurant\u2019s 15,680-square-foot lease was one of Houston\u2019s largest restaurant leases of 2024.\nCP Group is also building new spec suites at the property, the release shows.\nXceed Office, a provider of office suites, signed a deal to occupy 22,450 square feet, a full floor, at the 567,000-square-foot office building. Colliers\u2019 Edward Edson and Jordan Trout represented the tenant in the deal.\nCP Group also completed three new leases and two renewals, according to the release:\nEnergy and industrial company Hanwha USA, which was represented by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s David Guion, Albert Spiers, and Christopher Oliver, signed a 7,521-square-foot lease;\nNatural gas company Eagle LNG, which was represented by Harrison Yang of JLL, signed a 5,494-square-foot lease;\nCPA firm Arnie &amp; Company, which was represented by The Calibre Group\u2019s Candace Baggett, signed a 3,408-square-foot lease;\nGlobal financial services firm Robert W.

        "content": "Craig Hall\u2019s Hall Group is preparing to break ground on a new $140 million office building at its sprawling Hall Park development in Frisco.\nThe Dallas Morning News first\nreported\nthat construction is expected to begin Friday on the project at 2801 Network Boulevard, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The building will include 10 floors of office space totaling more than 206,000 square feet, sitting atop an eight-story parking garage with 1,345 spaces. The project is slated for completion in February 2028, the filing shows.\nHall Group\ndeclined to share additional details, saying the project remains in the planning stage. As with most TDLR filings, the specifications are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe site, referred to as Hall Park C5, has been in play for years. In March 2025, the Frisco City Council approved an amendment to its master development agreement with\nHall Group\nand its partners that expanded Kaleidoscope Park and cleared the way for a large parking garage that could support a new office building. That move effectively scrapped earlier plans for a performing arts center on the site.\nThe office building is the latest addition to Hall Park, Craig Hall\u2019s long-running redevelopment of a 162-acre campus he began assembling in 1989. What started as a suburban office park has morphed into a dense, mixed-use district with offices, apartments, hotels and public art, with total investment pegged around $7 billion.\nHall Park now includes 15 office buildings, along with residential projects and hospitality. The 224-room Hall Park Hotel, which opened in 2024, was recently named one of the best new hotels in the country by USA Today\u2019s 10Best Readers\u2019 Choice Awards.\nThe development sits just south of The Star, the\nDallas Cowboys\u2019 headquarters\nand practice facility, anchoring one of North Texas\u2019 most active\ncorporate corridors\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two Downtown Austin properties controlled by embattled developer Nate Paul\u2019s World Class Holdings could soon trade for a combined $172 million, potentially setting the stage for new skyscraper-scale development.\nA court-appointed receiver is negotiating sales of the property at 99 Trinity Street and a three-parcel assemblage near the Austonian tower at 201 and 203 Colorado Street, plus a neighboring parking lot, according to a receiver report filed Feb. 2 in Travis County court. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat Greg Milligan, who was named receiver in 2019 for the World Class entities that own the sites, said contracts could be ready for court approval \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\nThe prospective buyer has not been identified. But marketing materials from Chicago-based Harney Partners, where Milligan is an executive vice president, peg the combined purchase price at $172 million. If that number holds, it would nearly double the properties\u2019 combined appraised value of about $88.7 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nBoth sites were listed in late 2024, with purchase agreements signed in early 2025, subject to court approval. JLL is marketing the property at 99 Trinity and lists it as under contract.\nThe deals further highlight the unraveling of\nWorld Class\n, led by CEO\nNate Paul\n, whose legal troubles have cast\na long shadow\nover his downtown portfolio. Paul spent time in Travis County Jail for contempt of court amid a bitter dispute with the Mitte Foundation, a nonprofit investor in World Class projects. That case, along with other litigation and financial distress, have steadily pushed marquee sites out of the firm\u2019s control.\nThe 0.9-acre site at 99 Trinity is currently home to a low-slung sheet metal warehouse which sits next to a Four Seasons Hotel, the\nWaterline\ntower and the massive redevelopment of Austin\u2019s convention center across the street. The property carries a base floor-area ratio of 10-to-1, with a pathway to 25-to-1 and no height limit, according to JLL \u2014 and it sits outside Capitol View Corridors. World Class once floated a 39-story apartment tower there, but it never materialized.\nThe Colorado Street assemblage totals about 1.2 acres on the same block as the 683-foot Austonian. While a sliver of the parking lot falls within a Capitol View Corridor, the rest of the site allows substantial density through Austin\u2019s Downtown Density Bonus Program.\nDowntown height is currently capped at 350 feet under a temporary city ordinance, though developers can exceed it with council approval. City leaders are expected to clarify permanent height rules later this spring.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Partnership for New York City\u2019s new CEO says he relates to Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nLike Mamdani, Steve Fulop became a mayor in his 30s.\n\u201cI was elected as a mayor at 35 years old, trying to balance a political base that was pushing me to do certain things versus what I thought was in the best interest of Jersey City,\u201d Fulop said. \u201cI think he has to ultimately experience some of the give and take and grow.\u201d\nFulop was mayor of Jersey City for three terms, and unsuccessfully ran for New Jersey governor last year. The view from his office on the fifth floor of One Battery Park Plaza provides a reminder of his previous gig \u2014 Jersey City\u2019s skyline \u2014\u00a0as he embarks on his new role.\nAs head of the Partnership, he represents more than 300 businesses in the city. Members include some of the most prominent builders and owners in the city, such as Vornado Realty Trust, SL Green Realty, Tishman Speyer, Related Companies and Blackstone. To what extent Fulop will serve as a go-between for executives of such firms and the new mayor remains to be seen.\nDuring a recent interview, I asked Fulop about his relationship with Mamdani and what real estate issues are top of mind as he takes the helm at the Partnership. On the latter, he and the Partnership\u2019s board will be setting the organization\u2019s agenda this month. However, priorities include policies that make it easier for developers to build housing, property tax reform and public safety. He\u2019s not sure how vocal the Partnership will be on the mayor\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for stabilized apartments. It depends on how that promise plays out.\nYou said you plan to push a pro-growth, housing agenda. Have you spoken with Mayor Zohran Mamdani about this?\nThe housing conversation was more of a very\nsmall group of real estate executives\n. He has a lot of smart questions. He\u2019s very curious, and I think he\u2019s very committed to being an effective mayor. There\u2019s going to be a learning curve in the transition from being on [the] activist side to more of an elected official. He was [a state] Assembly person, but now he\u2019s a very prominent elected official. He has a base in that DSA that\u2019s very complicated, and I think it\u2019s not always in line with the realities of the world of being an effective executive, and I think that he\u2019s going to have to navigate that a little bit, and our role is to be helpful where he wants it.\nDoes that include conversations about the mayor\u2019s call to increase taxes?\nThe CEOs in the Partnership are responsible for billions upon billions of dollars in budgets, hundreds of thousands of employees. We want to be helpful. The public sector is most effective when they think about strategic partnerships with the private sector. It\u2019s on him whether he wants to be a part of that. I recognize that his base may not always appreciate that, but I think that part of the responsibility of being an effective mayor is recognizing that your base isn\u2019t always correct.\nWhat have you heard from your members?\nThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness. I think that nobody knows what a socialist mayor looks like. You haven\u2019t seen a socialist executive in any prominent role in decades. All of the DSA or socialist people that have been elected, up until now, are generally on the legislative side. That\u2019s a different type of person that can throw bombs from the outside with less accountability. It\u2019s a person that\u2019s not directly responsible for budgets. I think CEOs in the partnership are hopeful that things work out well, [but there\u2019s] a lot of anxiety about what this will ultimately be in six months, in a year.\nHave you heard from any developers in Jersey City since the new mayor took over?\nThey miss me. I mean, look, there\u2019s a lot of things that we started that are in queue. The hope is that the mayor continues the progress there. I think people there are nervous too, because he\u2019s made the real estate community out to be the villain. His campaign was about that, and I would hope that he would moderate now that he\u2019s won an election, but we\u2019ll see.\n[After this interview, Mayor James Solomon\nblamed\nFulop for leaving Jersey City with a $250 million budget deficit, saying his predecessor \u201csystematically prioritized short-term political gain over the City\u2019s long-term fiscal health.\u201d In a statement, Fulop disputed the claim and dismissed it as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d]\nDo you think you\u2019ll go back into the public sector?\nNo, I think that in many ways, this job is a capstone, dream job. It has all the benefits [of] public service, without any of the downside. You\u2019re in a very polarized environment for elected officials. When you think about the benefits versus the cost to your personal life and your family, I don\u2019t know if the trade-off is worth it in today\u2019s world.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who will run for Sen. Mike Gianaris\u2019 seat? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection\nposted on social media\nthat water usage dropped across the five boroughs during the Super Bowl\u2019s halftime show on Sunday. During the 15 minutes after the show concluded, the city saw a spike equivalent to 761,719 toilets flushing across the city.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly Wasow Park, who was appointed by former Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, resigned on Monday,\nGothamist reports\n. Park told the news site that the uncertainty around whether the Mamdani administration would keep her on \u201chas been really taxing on the agency, on me and my family.\u201d She has not yet chosen when her last day on the job will be. Her resignation comes as the city is grappling with a rising number of deaths due to extremely cold temperatures. Since Jan. 24, 18 people have been found dead outside.\n\u2014 The state chapter of the Working Families Party has chosen not to choose. The party has opted to endorse a placeholder candidate for governor rather than back Gov. Kathy Hochul or Antonio Delgado in the primary,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. The placeholder will be replaced by whoever wins the Democratic nomination.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$20.8 million\nfor a penthouse at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condominium unit is 5,300 square feet of new construction.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nBarbara Russo, Christopher Salierno, Elena Sarkissian and MariaElena Scotto have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31.6 million\nfor 1220 Broadway. The NoMad commercial building has 58 units and is 75,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29.8 million for a penthouse at 383 West Broadway. The Soho co-op unit is 7,500 square feet.\nReserve Partners\u2019\nTrish Riedel and Jonathan Isaacs have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A pair of developers scored a $60 million loan to build a condo building in Miami, as construction financing flows for South Florida residential projects amid higher interest rates.\nAscendra Capital and BAM Development scored the loan for their planned eight-story, 117-unit Seventeen Gables Condominium at 1715 Southwest 27th Avenue/Douglas Road, according to the lender\u2019s news release. Dwight Mortgage Trust provided the debt.\nIsaac Filler and Steve Edelstein were part of the Filler Capital team that represented the borrowers. David Scheer and Alex Izso of Dwight Mortgage originated the loan.\nConstruction is expected to start immediately, with completion slated for next year, the release says. The building will consist of one- to three-bedroom condo units, 178 parking spaces and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nSales are expected to commence once construction commences, with asking prices starting under $700,000, according to the release. Tensie Forry of Cervera Real Estate is leading sales.\nAn entity led by Mayer Berkovits of BAM paid $14.3 million for the 0.9-acre development site in 2023, assuming the seller\u2019s $4 million loan on the property and bumping it to $8.5 million, with S III Capital Partners as the lender, records show. That debt was reassigned to S III SB Real Estate Credit A, with Dwight Mortgage assuming the debt this month and bumping it up to $60 million, according to records.\nDwight Mortgage Trust is a real estate investment trust and affiliate of New York-based Dwight Capital.\nThe planned Seventeen Gables Condominium marks a change of plans for the site. BAM had planned an\neight-story, 120-unit\napartment building, Mayer Berkovits told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of its site purchase.\nAscendra Capital is led by David Steinberg.\nDevelopers have jumped on the area, which is close to Coral Gables, with plans for high-end condos.\nLast month, Allen Morris Company secured a\n$132.5 million\nconstruction loan for its long-planned 11-story, 58-unit Ponce Park condo development at 3000 Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables. Raimundo Onetto\u2019s Alta Developers is developing the 174-unit Cassia \u2013 The Residences at Coral Gables in Coral Gables at 4011 Salzedo Street, scoring a\n$94.2 million\nconstruction loan in May.\nLast year, Constellation Group and Boschetti Group switched their planned apartment project in Coral Gables to condos.

        "content": "David MacNeil, the founder of WeatherTech, dropped $68.3 million on a third oceanfront estate in Manalapan.\nIt brings his total spend on property in the small coastal enclave to $162.3 million. Records show MacNeil bought the mansion at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard from Frank and Dolores Mennella.\nPhilip Lyle Smith and Carla Ferreira-Smith with Luxury Resort Portfolio had the listing, and Margit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties brought the buyer.\nMacNeil has a net worth of $4 billion, according to Forbes. In January, President Donald Trump tapped him to serve on the Federal Trade Commission, and his appointment is awaiting confirmation. He also owns a car collection worth $400 million, Forbes\nreported\n.\nMacNeil has been on a South Florida real estate spending spree in recent years. Last year, he bought the 1.6-acre estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard for\n$55.5 million\n. It is adjacent to the 2-acre compound at 1120 South Ocean Boulevard he bought for\n$38.5 million\nin 2024.\nMacNeil also owns a half-acre waterfront compound in Fort Lauderdale which he bought for $5.5 million in 2013, records show. It is on the market asking $40 million, Zillow shows.\nThe Mennellases bought the 1.9-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard for $7.5 million in 2018. They built the 10,500-square-foot mansion in 2022, and it has six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa facilities, a theater, game room, craft room, two bowling alleys, a dock and a\ntunnel to the beach\n.\nThey listed it for\n$84.9 million\nin May, shortly after spending\na record $48 million\non a mansion in Jupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club. In 2023, they sold another oceanfront Manalapan mansion for\n$48.4 million\n.\nThe Mennellases\u2019 and MacNeils\u2019 recent real estate activity in Manalapan is a window into the rapid ascension of the small town amongst South Florida\u2019s top luxury markets.\nAgents say buyers see Manalapan as an appealing alternative to nearby Palm Beach\n. Manalapan has an abundance of oceanfront estates that also have dockage on the Intracoastal Waterway, and at lower prices than in Palm Beach.\nBillionaire Randal Kirk\nrecently found a buyer for his oceanfront Manalapan mansion after dropping the price from $134 million to $90 million.",

        "content": "Data centers may no longer be coming to a town near New Yorkers if a pair of state legislators get their way.\nState Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Anna Kelles introduced a bill that would create a three-year moratorium on data center development in the state, Wired\nreported\n. It\u2019s one of a half-dozen states to recently announce a measure to combat the proliferation of the industrial real estate sector.\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans are moving forward with exactly these kinds of moratoriums,\u201d Krueger said in a press conference. \u201cNew York should be in the front of the line to get this done.\u201d\nThe moratorium would see the cessation of permits issued for data center projects while the Department of Environmental Conservation and the Public Service Commission work on reports assessing data center impacts and suggesting regulations.\nData center development has become a significant boon for the real estate industry, as big technology players increasingly seek out more computing power, particularly for artificial intelligence use. FMI Corporation\nrecently forecasted\na 23 percent uptick in data\u2011center construction spending this year, pushing the sector to more than 6 percent of all nonresidential building activity \u2014 up sharply from 2 percent in 2023.\nBut the developments are also fraught with controversy, especially environmental concerns and worries about impact on the grid.\nNew York is home to more than 130 data centers. Several projects are in the works, including a 450-megawatt development in Ithaca. There\u2019s at least 10 gigawatts of electricity demand waiting to be connected to the grid.\nGov. Kathy Hochul recently launched an initiative to insulate ratepayers from high energy costs, demanding data center developers \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d\nAmong those calling for a national moratorium on such projects is Sen. Bernie Sanders. Food and Water Watch also gathered hundreds of environmental groups to press for a national moratorium.\nOther states where\ndata center moratoriums\nare under consideration include Georgia, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia; the latter is one of the biggest hubs of data centers in the country.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sales will resume at the West Hollywood condominium complex once known as the\nPendry Residences\n.\nThe 40-unit property at 8420 Sunset Boulevard finished the last of the paperwork with the California Department of Real Estate for its rebrand to the Sun Rose Residences once new ownership took it over less than two years ago.\nAfter hitting the pause button on sales mid-2025 for the property to prepare for the rebrand, the final dozen units at the Sun Rose are set to hit the market on Feb. 20 for the Sunset Strip development that saw\nrecords\nset under its former name.\nThat included the\n$14 million purchase\nin 2023 of Terrace Estate Penthouse 902. The 3,500-square-foot unit sold for $4,005 per square foot to mark the priciest condo trade in Los Angeles County that year.\n\u201cThe current ownership had a clear vision of what they wanted the property to be,\u201d said Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of Redeavor, the firm handling sales for the condos. \u201cMaking this change to Sun Rose, changing the programming and physical changes we\u2019ve made in the interim, we clearly believe that it\u2019s going to be a real shot in the arm for these units.\u201d\nThe former Pendry Residences, which were attached to a 149-key hotel, was constructed by AECOM Capital and Combined Properties for more than $500 million in 2021. The two struggled to pay off the\ndebt tied to the property\nas reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2024, paving the way for\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nto take a stake in the limited liability company controlling the property. Monarch held a $165 million mezzanine loan on the former Pendry.\nSince the ownership change, furnishings along with events and recreational programming have been revitalized to fit what Leipart called the Sun Rose\u2019s \u201clifestyle destination.\u201d\nAs a result, Leipart expects the rest of the property\u2019s condos to be sold by year\u2019s end.\nThe remaining units are priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and start at 3,010 square feet of interior space and go up to 4,656 square feet. The units\u2019 exterior spaces range from 1,086 square feet to 2,732 square feet.\nRedeavor is handling sales, picking up from when The Agency Development Group had previously been marketing the property. The same individuals at The Agency that handled sales for what was then the Pendry were also behind last year\u2019s\nlaunch of Redeavor\n.\nThe firm was started by a consortium of heavyweights in new development. That included Leipart, who founded The Agency Development Group; Andrew Wachtfogel, the co-founder and former president of new development at Official; Shane Farkas, former COO and CTO at The Agency; and Wade Hundley,\nFormida Capital\nCEO and former ST Residential CEO.\n",

        "content": "Peter Palandjian paired with David Carlins\u2019 development giant Magellan to snag the biggest multifamily prize in Chicago so far this year.\nA joint venture of Boston-based investment firm Intercontinental Real Estate, whose CEO is Palandjian, and Chicago-based Magellan paid $126 million late last month for the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower at\n73 East Lake Street\nin the Loop area, public records show. The seller was Tony Rossi and Tom Moran\u2019s Chicago-based firm, M&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment.\nAt roughly $380,000 per unit, the acquisition sets a new high-water mark for 2026. The transaction narrowly bested the year\u2019s previous top trade: the $110 million sale of an apartment complex in Chicago\u2019s southwest suburbs that closed in recent weeks.\nThe Chicago sale also marks the city\u2019s largest in terms of total price since\nAMLI Residential\u2019s $134 million purchase\nof the 275-unit Milieu apartment tower in the West Loop late last year. It\u2019s well shy of\n2025\u2019s priciest multifamily sale of $175 million\nfor the 398-unit North Water Apartments in November, which marked the biggest deal in the sector since 2023.\nIntercontinental\u2019s purchase marks a significant institutional return for the firm, which has been largely quiet in downtown Chicago since buying the office redevelopment at\n811 West Fulton Market\nfrom Shapack Partners and Alec Litowitz for $50.3 million in 2019, a record price per square foot for the city\u2019s office market at the time.\nIntercontinental, Magellan and seller M&amp;R didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.\nFor M&amp;R Development, the sale represents an exit from a property it held for over a decade in tandem with UBS, which bankrolled the cost of construction. UBS provided a nearly $76 million mortgage for the property\u2019s construction in 2012. Details on the property\u2019s financing since then aren\u2019t clear from public records.\nThe sellers originally explored the market with a listing in 2024, but the apartment building never sold. They re-listed the tower with a CBRE team of John Jaeger, Justin Puppi and Jason Zyck in 2025, betting on Chicago\u2019s robust rent growth and a thinning development pipeline. Peter Marino of CBRE arranged financing for Intercontinental and Magellan\u2019s transaction, though further details of the loan weren\u2019t publicly available Tuesday.\nM&amp;R\u2019s principals are veterans of Chicago\u2019s multifamily market, with Rossi serving as president of RMK Management, a property manager with a portfolio of thousands of apartments it operates for landlords in Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. M&amp;R also built the Addison &amp; Clark apartment and retail complex across the street from Wrigley Field on the city\u2019s North Side. Yet, the firm\u2019s partnership with\nUBS on that development lost most of its equity in a $100 million sale\nin 2023.\nThe Lake Street tower, just west of Millennium Park, is known for its high-end finishes and amenities. The building features an indoor pool, a two-story fitness center and the \u201cClub 73\u201d sky lounge on the 42nd floor. Its mix of convertible, one-, and two-bedroom units were 94 percent leased at the time it hit the market.\nThe investment comes as Chicago\u2019s apartment market cements its status as a national leader. While Sun Belt metros are currently drowning in a glut of new supply, Chicago\u2019s development pipeline has effectively run dry. Construction starts across the metro have plummeted to their\nlowest levels since 2012\n, with fewer than 4,000 units projected for completion this year, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.\n\u201dOver the next 12 -24 months, we expect the absolute number of vacant units downtown to be at the lowest levels in over a decade, in spite of the total number of units having virtually doubled since 2015,\u201d Chicago-based research firm Integra Realty Resources said in its annual report last month. \u201cRents are poised to spike given nominal new supply.\u201d\nThis supply-side drought has given existing premium buildings like the one at 73 East Lake Street a near-monopoly on high-end demand. With so little new product slated to hit the market in the coming years, stabilized Class A towers are seeing outsized rent appreciation, while competitors in overbuilt markets elsewhere are forced into concession wars \u2014 such as offering several months of free rent to new tenants \u2014 to keep units filled. As the largest trade of 2026, the $126 million deal is a flashing signal that institutional giants are finally ready to bet big on the Windy City\u2019s scarcity play.\n",

The proposal is sponsored in part by the\nCity of Santa Monica\n.\nAB 1740 would carve out a new category of \u201curban multimodal communities\u201d where local governments, not the commission, would have primary authority in dictating development, according to the bill. Zbur argues that the system, while essential for preserving sensitive resources, has created bottlenecks in areas where projects pose little environmental risk and are essential to housing production goals.\n\u201cThe California Coastal Act is one of our state\u2019s most important environmental laws, and is critical to protecting coastal access and our treasured coastal resources,\u201d Zbur said. \u201cHowever, in urbanized communities with robust public transit, current Coastal Commission standards must be modernized to achieve the important goals of the Coastal Act.\u201d\nUnder AB 1740, qualifying cities could approve housing projects without Coastal Commission permits if the developments are located in areas already zoned for multifamily use and are not within 300 feet of beaches, wetlands or environmentally sensitive habitat areas.\nMixed-income\nprojects \u2014 defined as those dedicating at least 7 percent of units to extremely low-income residents, 10 percent to very low-income households or 13 percent to lower-income residents \u2014 would be exempt from commission review when located in multifamily-designated areas. Dense developments with 10 or fewer units on sites smaller than 1 acre would also qualify if developed at a minimum density of 10 units per acre.\nIn qualifying cities, local governments could also add bike lanes, bus lanes and other multimodal transportation improvements without California Coastal Commission approval. AB 1740 would allow changes to roadways, including removal or relocation of on-street parking to make space for\nbicycle\ninfrastructure. The bill would also allow for the installation of accessible walkways, pay stations, signage and electric vehicle chargers in public facilities without permit approval.\nState lawmakers will consider AB 1740 in the policy committee later in this legislative session.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tom Souleles, a longtime dealmaker at Madison Dearborn Partners, didn\u2019t linger on the market when it came time to sell his Lincoln Park home.\nSouleles, vice chairman of the Chicago-based private equity firm, and his wife, Cia Souleles, sold their mansion at\n1964 North Burling Street\nfor the full $6.5 million asking price, closing Friday after just a week on the market last fall. The deal stands as the Chicago area\u2019s highest-priced home sale of the still-young year, according to Crain\u2019s which first\nreported\nthe sale.\nThe sale price for the five bedroom house equates to $956 per square foot. The couple bought the 6,800-square-foot house in 2002 after it was restored by developer\nFred Latsko\n, though the sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in public records. They later acquired the adjacent lot, creating a 50-by-123-foot parcel that gives the home a lawn, patio, rooftop decks and room to entertain \u2014 nearly the size of a standard double lot.\nThe couple listed the property Sept. 8 and had it under contract by Sept. 15, a brisk timeline even by Lincoln Park standards. Souleles did not respond to a request for comment by the publication, nor did listing agents Colette Cachey Smithburg and Joelle Cachey Hayes of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. The buyers, who are not yet identified in public records, were represented by Keith Brand of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago.\nOnly one other Chicago home has traded above $5 million this year, a\nGold Coast\nmansion that sold for $5.1 million in January. Three additional sales have cleared $4 million, in Lincoln Park, Bannockburn and Burr Ridge.\nBuilt in 1883, the\nItalianate\nhome features a carved limestone facade and bracketed cornice typical of late 19th century Chicago homes. The interior blends restored or recreated vintage details with modern updates: a stone fireplace mantel, curved stair railings, herringbone wood floors and high ceilings with crown moldings, according to the publication. A penthouse-level entertaining space opens onto a rooftop deck, designed to stay visually discreet from the street, with additional outdoor space atop the garage and along the side yard.\nSouleles joined Madison Dearborn in 1995 and rose through the ranks, as the firm became one of the country\u2019s most influential private equity players. He and Tim Sullivan were named co-CEOs in 2023 before Souleles moved into the vice chairman role.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

GI Partners bought the structures at 2805 and 2855 Bowers Avenue and 2710 Walsh Avenue in 2021 for $79 million.\nCoreSite\npaid 26.6 percent more for the buildings than\nGI Partners\ndid, signaling that buildings with the potential for data center development could fetch higher prices despite a weakened overall Bay Area office market.\nWhen GI Partners owned the buildings, the firm looked to develop a 244,100-square-foot data center at 2805 Bowers Avenue by demolishing the existing building on the site. The City of Santa Clara approved the proposal in 2024. GI\u2019s plans for the other sites were not clear.\nCoreSite has not disclosed plans for the three buildings, including whether it hopes to follow through with GI Partners\u2019 proposal or convert the existing structures into data centers.\nData centers in Santa Clara County have been attracting investor interest as\nartificial intelligence increases its foothold\nin the Bay Area and beyond.\nIn November, Brookfield subsidiary Centersquare\nbought two adjacent data centers\nin Santa Clara from Menlo Equities for $97 million in cash, one at 4650 Old Ironsides Drive for $55 million and the other at 4700 Old Ironsides Drive for $42 million.\nA month prior, a Goodman Group affiliate\npurchased a site in north San Jose\nthat has been proposed for a data center. The 46.8 acres at 350 and 370 West Trimble Road are largely vacant.\nPower delivery is also an issue for these facilities. Data center developers Digital Realty Trust and Stack Infrastructure each built data centers in Santa Clara, though they\nmight not get full power\nuntil 2028 as city-owned utility Silicon Valley Power doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to deliver enough electricity needed to fuel the power-hungry facilities.\nThe city of Santa Clara has nearly 60 active or under-construction data centers, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin decided to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture that will transform 350 Park Avenue.\nVornado Realty Trust\u2019s Michael Franco on Tuesday said that Griffin wanted to accelerate the deal timeline, which originally gave him until June 2030 to either take a 60 percent stake or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, meaning that Vornado and Rudin Management would not take part in the development.\nGriffin chose the former in December, and thanks to a few other amendments to a 2022 agreement, Vornado and Rudin will be able to acquire an interest between 23 percent and 40 percent in the joint venture by July (with Vornado\u2019s stake ranging between 21 and 36 percent). The previous terms called for Vornado to take a 36 percent interest, and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition for the project is slated to start in April to make way for a new 2 million-square-foot office tower.\n\u201cWe intend to be part of this project,\u201d Franco said during Vornado\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.\nVornado executives also indicated that Citadel, the tower\u2019s anchor tenant, may take more space than the previously announced 850,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe Citadel team is still making up their mind as to what exactly their requirements are,\u201d Vornado CEO Steve Roth said in response to an analyst\u2019s question. Franco added that the company is seeing interest from companies with leases expected to expire between 2031 and\u00a0 2033 who are looking for as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe partners filed\npermit applications\nfor the project late last year, after the City Council approved\nrezoning\nthe site.\nVornado executives also provided an update on other redevelopment projects. Last month, the real estate investment trust acquired 3 East 54th Street for\n$141 million\n, with plans to demolish the existing office building on the site. Roth said the REIT is considering options for the site, but noted that \u201cthe location is excellent for hotel, office and residential uses.\u201d Roth repeatedly said he is \u201cin love\u201d with 623 Fifth Avenue, an\noffice building\nit bought for $218 million last year. The company plans to reposition the building as the \u201c220 Central Park South of boutique office\u201d by the end of 2027.\nFunds from operations during the fourth quarter were $110.9 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $122.2 million, or 61 cents per share, during the same period in 2024. For the year, FFO was $465 million, or $2.32 per share, up from 2024\u2019s $447 million, or $2.26 per share.\nRoth acknowledged that the REIT\u2019s stock price has been struggling, but said \u201cthere is a huge disconnect between our stock price and the value of our assets.\u201d One year ago, to the day, Vornado\u2019s stock price was about $42 per share, but it hasn\u2019t reached above $40 since October, and as of noon on Tuesday, was just below $32.\nThe REIT\u2019s board authorized a stock buyback in 2023 and repurchased nearly 1.5 million common shares in 2025 for $50.9 million, at an average price of $34.9 per share.\n\u201cI am certainly aware of the recent decline in our stock and, in fact, the decline in all real estate stocks,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIn our case, the decline was in the face of the best fundamentals in Manhattan in the last 20 years. While this most likely represents a great buying opportunity, we will proceed with care, looking over our shoulder.\u201d\nHe said if the disconnect continues, Vornado will \u201cbecome more aggressive.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Global law firm Linklaters is bulking up in Midtown.\nThe London-based firm is adding 48,000 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s\n1290 Sixth Avenue\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. Linklaters signed a 10-year lease for a portion of the building\u2019s 11th floor, bringing its total footprint at the tower to more than 150,000 square feet. The new lease is coterminous with the firm\u2019s existing deal at the property. The asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell represented Linklaters in the transaction, while Vornado was represented in-house by Edward Riguardi and Ryan Levy.\nLinklaters, which has offices across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, is the latest tenant to bet on Midtown\u2019s flight-to-quality trend, which has helped drive leasing momentum to a six-year high. The firm has been expanding in New York and Washington, D.C. In October, it added 6,500 square feet on the 34th floor of 1290 Sixth.\nThe expansion comes after Vornado completed a major renovation at the 43-story Sixth Avenue tower, which was built in 1963. Upgrades include a revamped lobby, a new curtain wall and the addition of wellness-focused amenities aimed at keeping the building competitive with newer office developments.\nInvestment firm\nNeuberger Berman\nremains the building\u2019s anchor tenant, occupying roughly 400,000 square feet under a lease signed in 2015.\nThe ownership structure of 1290 Sixth Avenue is also notable. The Trump Organization owns a 30 percent stake in the property through a partnership agreement that restricts a sale until 2044. The building is among the assets in President Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio that could be affected by\na New York judge\u2019s ruling\ntied to allegations that Trump inflated his company\u2019s property values for financial gain.\nLinklaters\u2019 deal marks the latest lease signed at the building this year, following Oaktree Capital Management\u2019s 79,000-square-foot deal in January for the entire 12th floor.\nVornado and Linklaters declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty continued its portfolio modification at the end of 2025.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust entered into an agreement to offload a three-building, roughly 430,000-square-foot office campus in San Diego\u2019s I-15 Corridor for $124.5 million. That deal closed last month and amounts to about $290 per square foot. The three properties at 13480, 13500 and 13520 Evening Creek Drive North were 57,100 and 74 percent occupied, respectively, per the company\u2019s latest annual filing. Kilroy will continue to dispose of millions of dollars worth of non-core real estate, the company said on Tuesday\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nLed by\nAngela Aman\n, Kilroy purchased a four-building, 230,000-square-foot life sciences campus in San Diego for $192 million in Torrey Pines, a neighborhood between La Jolla, a life sciences hub, and Del Mar. The deal equated to $835 per square foot. Three of the four properties are 100 percent occupied, and one is 28 percent filled, per a financial filing. Aman called it a \u201cgenerational opportunity,\u201d on the earnings call, and said it strengthened the company\u2019s San Diego presence.\nThe moves echo earlier decisions to dump less occupied offices in less desirable spots such as\n501 Santa Monica\nor\nSunset Media Center\nin the heart of Hollywood \u2014 and purchase\nMaple Plaza\n, a campus in Beverly Hills, for $205 million or about $700 a foot. The Beverly Hills property continues to attract new and renewal leases, the company said.\nThe company\u2019s portfolio was about 82 occupied at year end, and Kilroy signed more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2025, its highest annual leasing volume since before the pandemic. But leases for about a million more square feet are set to expire. On a call last quarter, Aman said she mostly\nanticipates\n\u201cmove-outs,\u201d a point she reiterated on Tuesday\u2019s call. The company anticipates average full year occupancy at 76 percent to 78 percent, per its guidance.\nKilroy reported a net income of $12 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2025, compared to $60 million a year earlier. For the year ended December 2025, the real estate investment trust reported a net income of $276 million compared to $211 million through 2024.\n",

If the deal closes at that price, its $3,313 per square foot would outpace the previous record by 9 percent.\nLast year, Penthouse 1A set the record for a condo sale when it\nclosed for $7.5 million\n, or $3,046 per square foot. That deal also marked the priciest condo sponsor sale in the neighborhood.\nThe new record would represent another win for One Domino in its unofficial battle for the top with\nOne Williamsburg Wharf, a condo component of Naftali Group\u2019s\nbroader redevelopment along the waterfront. The two developments, which launched sales within four months of each other in 2024 and sit less than 10 blocks apart, had traded condo records back and forth over the past few years.\nA penthouse at One Williamsburg Wharf that sold for\n$7.2 million\nat the end of 2024 held the title of priciest sponsor sale in the area for about six months. Before that, a One Domino Square that went for\n$5.8 million\nhad the record.\nSales director Aaron Goed previously downplayed any competition between the buildings. \u201cI think their success helps us, and vice versa, and there\u2019s definitely enough demand to go around,\u201d Goed told\nThe Real Deal\nin June.\nWilliamsburg Wharf will have more cracks at the crown when it launches the project\u2019s second phase, which includes 360 condos across two residential towers known as 80 Wharf Way. That portion is expected to be completed in 2028. Naftali Group and Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries landed\n$525 million in construction loans\nfor the project in December.\nBoth developments have contributed to a surge in home prices in North Brooklyn and the borough\u2019s new development market as a whole. In the fourth quarter, the median sale price in the area spanning Williamsburg and Greenpoint jumped 20 percent annually to a record $1.65 million, according to a report from Corcoran.\nSpanning over 2,100 square feet, Penthouse 3A comes with three bedrooms, three full bathrooms and nearly 1,000 square feet of rooftop outdoor space. The turnkey apartment came furnished by Irish design brand Orior.\nLed by an in-house sales team, over two-thirds of the 160 units in One Domino Square\u2019s condo portion have sold. The development also includes a 399-unit rental portion and is part of Two Trees\u2019 larger development site that includes and surrounds the old Domino Sugar refinery.\n",

        "content": "Ranco Capital and the Gilardian family are approaching the checkered flag on a luxury rental development in Murray Hill, securing a nine-figure loan to push the development across the finish line.\nRanco and the Gilardians landed a $115 million loan to refinance the 22-story project at 162 East 36th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Affinius Capital provided the debt, which was arranged by Galaxy Capital\u2019s Henry Bodek.\nThe financing is expected to go towards completing construction \u2014 which is anticipated to wrap this year \u2014 and stabilizing the property through lease-up.\nRanco did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe 160-unit project sits on the corner of Third Avenue and East 36th Street. It will include 87 studios, 46 one-bedrooms and 27 two-bedroom units, along with 3,700 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.\nThe developers previously scored an $87 million construction loan from BridgeCity Capital in September 2024, according to\nPincusCo\n, split between $82 million in senior debt and $5 million in mezzanine debt. The prior lender to that was Safra National Bank, which held debt with an original amount of $23.1 million.\nRun by Joseph Banda, Ranco is based in Brooklyn. It made waves in 2023 when it received\nrezoning approval\nto pave the way for a rental development at 703 Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Ranco\u2019s planned mixed-use building would\u2019ve brought 54 rental units to the block, including 18 affordable to households earning less than 80 percent of the area median income.\nRanco sold the site to Blue Sky Developers eight months ago for $10.8 million, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nThe Gilardians typically do business under Gilar Realty, which refinanced 237 East 34th Street with 105 units in Murray Hill and 114 West 86th Street with 49 units on the Upper West Side with\na $55.75 million loan\nfrom Bank of Montreal in February 2023. The apartment buildings are co-owned by Alex Forkosh\u2019s Forkosh Development Group.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

They tapped the architecture firm GarciaStromberg to design the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Fort Lauderdale Beach, with interiors by Dan Fink Studio.\nPrices start at $2.5 million.\nThe partners bought the 1.5-acre waterfront site for $30 million in 2023, property records show.\nThe Ritz-Carlton will have units spanning between two- and three-bedrooms, ranging from 1,600 to 3,500 square feet, the release shows.

Amenities in the complex will include two pools, dock slips, a catering kitchen, screening room, multi-sport simulator, meeting room and children\u2019s playroom, the release shows.\nUlis and MICL, helmed by chairman emeritus Parag Shah, tapped Douglas Elliman Development Marketing to lead sales and marketing for the project.\nFort Lauderdale has emerged as a hub of luxury condo development in recent years. As prices for dev sites in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties have skyrocketed, developers have turned to Fort Lauderdale and surrounding Broward markets as a more affordable alternative.\nThere are\nmore than two dozen projects totaling nearly 4,000 units\nin the pipeline across coastal Broward markets, particularly concentrated in Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.\nFor example, Miki Naftali is planning\na 45-story, 370-unit Viceroy-branded condo\nproject.\nRelated Group has invested heavily in Broward County condo projects.

        "content": "As Indiana officials loudly court the Chicago Bears with a publicly funded stadium pitch, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says his state is gaining ground in negotiations to keep the NFL franchise.\nPritzker said Monday that he and his team have made \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with the Bears, even as Republican leaders in Indiana push legislation designed to lure the franchise across the border, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The comments come amid heightened maneuvering on both sides of the state line, with billions of dollars in real estate and infrastructure hanging in the balance.\nPritzker\u2019s January calendar showed two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while\nGoodell was in Chicago\nfor the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10, according to the outlet. During that visit, Goodell toured the Bears\u2019 preferred site in Arlington Heights \u2014 the former Arlington Park racetrack the team owns \u2014 as well as potential sites in northwest Indiana, including land near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\nAt the heart of the Illinois talks are long-running disputes over how much public support the Bears should receive for a new stadium and surrounding development. Those issues include who pays for infrastructure around the Arlington Heights site, how the team\u2019s future property taxes would be assessed and whether the state would help cover debt tied to Soldier Field renovations completed more than 20 years ago.\nThe Bears have pegged infrastructure needs alone at $855 million. The team has said it would privately finance the stadium itself,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s, anchoring a proposed $5 billion mixed-use campus with commercial and residential components in Arlington Heights.\nIndiana, meanwhile, is offering a more straightforward \u2014 and costlier \u2014 proposition. Since the Bears signaled in December that an out-of-state move was on the table, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has pushed legislation to create a Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority empowered to build and finance an NFL stadium with public dollars. Insiders have put the potential price tag north of $3.5 billion.\nThe\nIndiana Senate\nhas already passed a bill establishing the authority, and the House speaker has said he supports it. The clock is ticking: The Legislature is set to adjourn by the end of the month.\nUnder the Indiana proposal, the Bears would sign a lease of at least 35 years, pay operating and maintenance costs and keep all stadium-generated revenue. The team would also have the option to buy the stadium for $1 at the end of the lease \u2014 or sooner, if construction debt is paid off.\nBack in Illinois, Pritzker struck an optimistic tone during an unrelated appearance in Belleville.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the\nBears\n, and indeed, frankly, progress that\u2019s been made,\u201d he said, while declining to outline specific concessions. \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing money at building a stadium for anybody.\u201d\nThe Tribune reported that Pritzker\u2019s office signed a new $25,000 contract in late December with an outside attorney to advise the administration in negotiations through the end of June.\nA major sticking point remains: a proposed \u201cmegaproject\u201d bill backed by the Bears and\nArlington Heights officials\n. The legislation would allow the team to negotiate long-term property tax terms with local taxing bodies, requiring a change in state law. Arlington Heights Village Manager Randy Recklaus said the village, state and team are \u201cactively working together to solve outstanding issues\u201d and that talks are moving quickly.\nThe Bears declined to comment. Pritzker said he believes the Indiana threat is real, not a bluff.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The federal government is lightening its real estate load in Central Texas, handing off more than 240 acres of underused land near the San Marcos Regional Airport to local entities.\nThe U.S. General Services Administration said it transferred two former Department of Labor properties east of the airport to\nTexas State University\nand the city of\nSan Marcos\n, moving the sites out of federal ownership as part of a broader push to reduce excess property holdings, according to federal and local officials, MySa.com\nreported\n.\nGSA Administrator Edward C. Forst framed the move as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cost-cutting agenda in a statement, calling it \u201ca victory for the American taxpayer.\u201d\nThe land breaks down into two tracts. One spans more than 195 acres and includes a cluster of buildings near William Pettis Road east of the San Marcos Regional Airport, while the other covers roughly 45 acres of\nundeveloped land\n. Earlier this year, Texas State University took title to about 75 acres from the northern portion of the larger tract, including the existing facilities.\nThe city of San Marcos later acquired the balance of the property, nearly 170 acres in total, for $1.7 million through a negotiated sale. GSA said the transaction was completed in coordination with local and federal partners and followed all required disposal rules, formally removing the land from the federal inventory.\nTexas State plans to keep using its portion of the site for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, known as ALERRT, a nationally recognized program that trains law enforcement officers and first responders and supports research on active shooter response. The outlet reported that the expansion is expected to allow the university to serve more agencies from around the country, according to a statement from Texas State President Kelly Damphousse.\nSan Marcos city officials said the land will be used to support future expansion of the regional airport, a growing property as the\nAustin-San Antonio corridor\ncontinues to densify.\nCity Manager Stephanie Reyes pointed to economic development and land use compatibility around the airport, calling it \u201can important step in supporting the long-term needs of the entire San Marcos community.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As South Florida\u2019s decadeslong housing affordability crisis surged in the past few years, developers in Miami took note \u2013\u2013 unlike those in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.\nIn Miami-Dade County, 8,690 affordable units were completed from 2020 through 2024, according to RentCafe, a Yardi Systems-owned apartment listing and research platform. That marks a 97 percent increase from the deliveries in the Magic City from the period from 2015 to 2019.\nMiami ranked 10th nationwide for the number of\naffordable\nunits finished, yet affordable housing construction slowed elsewhere in South Florida.\nIn\nPalm Beach County\n, 1,069 units were completed from 2020 through 2024, a 15 percent decline from the previous five-year period.\nBroward County\nhad 955 affordable unit completions from 2020 through 2024, an 18 percent drop from the previous five years.\nThe findings come as the state and South Florida officials have been working to incentivize the construction of more below-market apartments. During a pandemic era influx of out-of-staters, South Florida experienced unprecedented housing demand and record rent growth, exacerbating the lack of affordable housing.\nAmong the projects finished in Miami is Swerdlow Group\u2019s Sawyer\u2019s Walk in Overtown with\n578 apartments\nrestricted for seniors earning up to 60 percent of the area median income. Swerdlow finished the project in 2024 in partnership with JM Partners and Alben Duffie.\nRelated Urban Development Group, the affordable housing arm of the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, has been completing in phases the redevelopment of Liberty Square in Miami\u2019s Liberty City, so far delivering close to 800 rentals, including public housing, project-based voucher units, affordable and workforce units.\nStill, the report only accounted for entirely affordable developments, excluding mixed-income buildings that include apartments at market rents. This essentially excludes Live Local Act projects, which can have a mix of incomes as long as 40 percent of apartments are reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nSouth Florida developers still are mostly prioritizing market-rate rentals, as the affordable housing deliveries from 2020 through 2024 represent a drop compared to total multifamily completions.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s completions represented 19 percent of total apartment deliveries, while they accounted for 8 percent and 4 percent of total deliveries in Palm Beach County and Broward County, respectively, according to the report.\nBut the jump to affordable housing also could stem from South Florida\u2019s slowdown of market-rate units. Developers seized on the pandemic bonanza with plans for new projects, which led to hefty deliveries in recent years just as the in-migration slowed. This led to a supply overhang, with slower leaseups and an increase in concessions. By contrast, demand for affordable units is close to ensured in South Florida.\nNationwide, nearly 310,000 affordable apartments were finished, a 73 percent increase from the completions from the prior five-year period, the report says. Seattle took the lead, followed by New York, Austin, Minneapolis/St.Paul and Atlanta.\nSan Antonio, which ranked ninth in total unit completions, along with Phoenix and Charlotte, also had the fastest growth in affordable housing construction, recording a 222.5 percent, 206.3 percent and 191 percent increase in completions compared with the previous five years.\n",

Formerly known as the VIP Apartments,\nSan Francisco-based FPA\nhas renamed the property ReNew Lake Arlington, joining with other properties in the area sharing the ReNew branding.\nThe seller was an entity tied to the Manda family, which had owned the apartment complex for many years. Reached by phone, Mark Manda confirmed the sale, stating that he has sold off his real estate holdings as part of a move into retirement. He declined to comment further on the specifics of the transaction, though the sale price represents a significant payday for the legacy owner of the property built in 1972.\nIt had been encumbered by relatively low leverage for years, with a Mark Manda-led entity taking out a $15 million Freddie Mac-backed loan originated by CBRE against the property in 2021, public records show.\nFPA\u2019s acquisition arrives amid a flurry of big deals at the start of the year in Chicagoland\u2019s apartment market. Last month,\nOsso Capital offloaded a massive complex in Crest Hill for $110 million\n, about the same time eight-figure deals for properties in Aurora and Palatine closed. Together, they signal institutional appetite for suburban Chicago density remains at a fever pitch.\nThis wave of activity follows FPA setting the market\u2019s high bar in 2025, suggesting investors are eager to lock in early in the year as Chicago\u2019s stature rises to the top for many multifamily investors due to a lack of new development. FPA didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s recent acquisition highlights Chicago\u2019s emergence as a top-tier performer on the national stage. While overdevelopment has led to an inventory surplus in Sun Belt cities, Chicago\u2019s building pipeline has essentially hit a bottleneck. Local construction starts have plummeted to a low not seen since 2012. This scarcity is creating a tight squeeze for renters, as landlords have the upper hand in lease rate negotiations.\n\u201cDevelopers indicate virtually every proposed deal is in a holding pattern,\u201d Chicago-based Integra Realty Resources said in its annual outlook for the region last month. \u201cWhile banks are willing to issue construction loans, attracting equity remains a challenge. Rising rental rates and strong overall market fundamentals will compel equity to return to the market. However, we don\u2019t anticipate any material new (downtown Chicago) construction deliveries until at least 2028.\u201d\nMedian rent was up 3.2 percent in the suburban market in the third quarter, year-over-year, with strong occupancy at 97.6 percent, Integra found.\nFor FPA, the Wheeling property is the latest piece in a sprawling regional portfolio. While the firm made a rare exit in early 2025 by selling a Downers Grove property to Laramar Group, its recent activity has been defined by massive capital deployment. The firm\u2019s dominance was most visible in December, when it closed Chicago\u2019s largest multifamily deal of the year: a $175 million purchase of a luxury tower in Streeterville. That blockbuster was followed weeks later by an\n$89 million purchase in the same neighborhood\n.\nFPA\u2019s strategy has been equally focused on Chicago\u2019s suburban collar. In July 2024, the firm spent\n$102 million on a Hoffman Estates property\n, and in March, it utilized an assumable debt structure to acquire another suburban Naperville property for a total of $68 million.\n",

The California-based firm broke ground in March of last year, marking a major milestone for a development that has steadily grown in scale, scope and cost since its initial approval in 2019.\nOriginally pitched as a $200 million, 1 million-square-foot project, The District has since ballooned into a nearly 4 million-square-foot campus expected to cost north of $500 million at full build-out, based on prior\nreporting\n. The 66-acre site sits near the intersection of I-35 and State Highway 45, adjacent to Dell Technologies\u2019 sprawling\nRound Rock headquarters\n\u2014 a proximity Mark IV has repeatedly cited as a core selling point.\nThe construction loan was led by BDT &amp; MSD Partners, with participation from an affiliate of Apollo Global Management. George Smith Partners served as financial advisor and placement agent, advising on capitalization strategy, lender engagement and execution.\nThe loan will fund vertical construction of Phase I, which centers on luxury multifamily and retail, according to the outlet.\nThe headline component of the first phase is a seven-story,\n316-unit apartment building\n, constructed with five levels of wood-frame construction atop a two-level concrete podium. Units will include studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments, with more than 23,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to the publication. Amenities aim to compete at the high end of the suburban Austin market, including a third-floor pool deck, cold plunge, dry sauna, fitness center and clubhouse lounge.\nPhase I also includes a 40,750-square-foot food-and-beverage plaza made up of six standalone buildings, with spaces ranging from 1,500 square feet to nearly 12,000 square feet. Mark IV is pitching the plaza as an early foot-traffic driver and economic catalyst for later phases.\nAt full build-out, targeted for completion in about 2039,\nThe District\nis expected to include office, multifamily, retail and hospitality uses and support up to 5,000 jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Retting Gun Store, when it was closing in 2023, for more than $6 million to prevent another one from opening, KTLA\nreported\n.\nCulver City officials previously considered applications from developers before directing staff to enter into an exclusive negotiation agreement with West Hollywood Community Housing for the affordable housing development.\nThe developer\u2019s plan calls for replacing a triangular commercial building at 11029 Washington Boulevard with a seven-story residential structure with 67 affordable units along with ground-floor artist spaces and a community art center. The project is expected to cost roughly $50.2 million, or about $749,000 per unit.\nWashington Palms would consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments intended for households earning between 30 and 80 percent of the\narea median income\n. In Los Angeles County, that would work out to an annual income of between $31,850 and $84,850 for one person, or $45,450 to $121,150 for a household of four.\nThe EYRC Architects designed the development.\nThe developer proposed using off-site\nmodular construction\nmethods to speed completion of the project.\nCulver City is required to\nplan\nfor 3,341 new housing units by 2029 under the city\u2019s housing element.

Chicago-based\nHabitat Company\n, working on behalf of Red Cup Land Company, will rezone the property from industrial to residential and begin construction this spring, with an 18 to 24-month buildout timeline.\nPlans call for\n227 townhomes\nspread across 48 building assemblies, with parking tucked into first-floor garages and supplemented by on-street spaces. The project includes nearly 13 acres of open space, internal private roads and a clubhouse with a pool, according to approved plans. Thirty-four units will be set aside as affordable housing under Highland Park\u2019s inclusionary housing rules.\nMayor Nancy Rotering praised the outcome after the vote, saying \u201ca city growing is a city progressing.\u201d\nThe vote, however, was not without friction, as some council members approved the project alongside two amendments aimed at addressing safety and quality-of-life concerns raised by nearby residents.\nA proposed pedestrian crossing at Ridge Road and Devonshire Court drew sharp criticism from neighbors, who warned it would create a dangerous traffic condition, the outlet reported. As part of the final approval, the council removed the crosswalk from the initial plan and deferred any decision on adding it until the development reaches 90 percent occupancy.\nCouncil members also raised concerns about the project\u2019s proximity to Bluegrass, a nearby restaurant. One amendment asks the developer to increase the buffer between the eatery and an adjacent parking area, pushing beyond the originally proposed 2.5 feet if feasible.\nThe developer also agreed to set aside $25,000 in escrow to cover unforeseen issues during construction. City Attorney Steve Elrod said at the meeting that the city will have sole discretion over whether and how those funds are used.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The third time might be the charm for a site in\nWest Berkeley\nthat has twice been considered for housing in recent years.\nLos Altos-based developer California Supportive Housing filed an application last week with the City of Berkeley to build a 94-unit, 100-percent affordable apartment building at 2147 San Pablo Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The proposal calls for demolishing an existing auto body and auto glass shop to make way for a six-story\nworkforce housing\nbuilding with a 46-space parking garage.\nIf approved, the development would bring \u201cmuch needed affordable workforce housing to a commercial district along a major transit corridor in West Berkeley,\u201d California Supportive Housing\u2019s application said.\nThe developer is using\nAB 2011\n, which limits zoning changes after applications are filed and streamlines approvals for housing on commercial sites. The firm took advantage of the state\ndensity bonus\n, which permits developers to build more housing on a site than zoning rules would typically allow in exchange for a certain number of affordable units.\nThe site is owned by Alameda-based Wang Brothers Investments, which purchased the location in 2022 for nearly $2.8 million. Wang Brothers applied to build a 128-unit co-living development with ground-floor retail at the site. That effort appears to be inactive, according to the Business Times. Wang Brothers, in tandem with Studio KDA, submitted several plan revisions, including increasing the number of units to 144 and cutting down on the ground-floor retail space. The plan was last updated in November 2024 and was considered by the Design Review Commission in February 2025.\nThat was the second proposal submitted for the site. The previous owner, an unnamed applicant, floated building a 44-unit apartment building geared toward students at the University of California, Berkeley.\nAs Berkeley faces an ongoing housing shortage, developers have been filing applications to build residences to fill the gap. New state housing laws like AB 2011,\nSB 330\nand California\u2019s density bonus have made new construction projects more financially feasible. Many of those proposals are centered around the UC Berkeley campus east of downtown.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tarrytown has long been\none of Austin\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods\n. (Just ask\nEmma Stone\n.) But last year, its home sale prices dropped more than in any other neighborhood in the city.\nDespite being\none of the wealthiest ZIP codes in Texas\n, home sales in ZIP code 78703 fell more than in any other ZIP code in\nAustin\nin 2025, year over year, according to Multiple Listing Service data published by Team Price Real Estate. Although Austin\u2019s private listing scene obscures the full picture, agents say that luxury buyers\u2019 interest in the neighborhood has lessened since the housing boom of the pandemic.\nThe 252 homes sold in Tarrytown last year averaged a sale price of $1.5 million, an 11 percent drop from the average sale price of $1.7 million in 2024 \u2014 and the greatest percentage decline in the city, Team Price reports.\nMeanwhile, the fellow luxury strongholds of\nDowntown\nand Westlake generally held flat, indicating that Austin\u2019s lapse in luxury demand isn\u2019t affecting the market uniformly. The average sale price of a Downtown Austin home rose by less than $1,000 in 2025, year-over-year, hovering at about $1 million. In Westlake, the average sale price fell by just 1 percent, from $2.22 million to $2.19 million.\nAll of Austin inflated during the pandemic, as the city attracted buyers from the coasts. Now that many of those buyers are leaving, enduring value remains in neighborhoods like Westlake, which is within the exemplary Eanes Independent School District, while the froth is being skimmed away from neighborhoods like Tarrytown, said Moreland Properties agent Greg Walling.\n\u201cAs the market softened, those out-of-town buyers have moved on or decided to go back home, or whatever the case may be. And so some of those sales [dropped in value] in some people\u2019s eyes, even though they were just elevated in such a quick manner,\u201d Walling said.\nHowever, due to a widespread preference for off-market trades among Austin luxury sellers, MLS data captures only a portion of the true market, according to Amy Deane, the top producer for 2025 at Moreland Properties.\n\u201c\nIf I have a waterfront house, and it\u2019s worth $20 million\nand it\u2019s on the tax roll at three and a half [million], we\u2019re going to do everything we can to sell it off-market. Because no buyer is going to want to pay market price when the taxes are a fifth of what it\u2019s actually worth,\u201d Deane said.\n\u201cMost of our sales of luxury homes are never hitting the public market, so nobody knows what they\u2019re selling for,\u201d she added.\nEven so, the luxury market has cooled significantly since the heat of 2021. While the resale market evades comprehensive analysis, spec homes and land are both cheaper in Tarrytown lately, Deane said. The price of an acre in ZIP code 78703 jumped by almost $1 million from 2021 to 2022 and fell by about $100,000 by 2024, according to the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\n.\n\u201cLate 2020 and early 2021, I was writing offers for buyers that were like, \u2018All cash over ask\u2019; \u2018No inspection\u2019; \u2018We love your home, and we love your cat and your dog, and we\u2019ll adopt your kids if you let us buy the house.\u2019 After the surge, you didn\u2019t have to do that anymore,\u201d Deane said.\nFewer elite sales are taking place behind the scenes as a result\n.\n\u201cA property I have on Northumberland [Road} that sold in the fives [millions], I would have always sold that off-market,\u201d Deane said. \u201cI had to sell it on market last year because I needed the visibility.\u201d\n",

        "content": "For whatever reason, the Mamdani administration chose Super Bowl Sunday \u2014 four hours before kickoff \u2014 to release an updated list of buildings in the dreaded\nAlternative Enforcement Program\n.\nThe mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t bury the news in order to spare landlords bad publicity. Just two days later it made a\nbig show\nof announcing its \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, which have outraged and scared owners even before the first hearing.\nIn his press release about the\nupdated AEP list\n, Mayor Zohran Mamdani vowed, \u201cNew York will no longer look the other way while bad landlords put tenants at risk.\u201d\nBut AEP is in its 19th year. Clearly the city has not been looking the other way. The problem is, AEP has not been very effective, despite imposing penalties and charging landlords several times the normal cost of repairs. It tends to put out some fires in a building, then move on without fixing the fundamental problems.\nIf AEP worked well, the crisis of violations Mamdani keeps calling out would not exist. Yet his new list was accompanied only by bluster, not reforms.\nWhen\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Quinn Waller looked into what happened to buildings owned by\nnotorious landlord Aron Stark\nafter they were thrown into AEP, she found few signs of progress.\nNor did it inspire changes in Stark\u2019s stewardship of the buildings.\nWaller reported last fall that the city put 1422 Greene Avenue into AEP in 2021 and has since made some repairs and billed them to Stark. But he hadn\u2019t paid, and as of Oct. 1 the 12-unit building still had 79 open violations, 32 of them immediately hazardous.\nToday it has 80 open HPD violations, 67 of which are class B or C. It also has six active\nbuilding violations\nand eight open\nenvironmental violations\n. Stark hasn\u2019t even filed a property registration form since 2020, and tenants have said he\u2019s abandoned the building.\nYet somehow 1422 Greene Avenue was removed from the AEP list.\nInstead Mamdani singled out 34-15 Parsons Boulevard in Queens, a 175-unit A&amp;E building which the mayor said has more than 1,000 \u201cof the most serious violations.\u201d But half of the building\u2019s\n1,239 violations\nhave been fixed \u2014 they just haven\u2019t been cleared because HPD hasn\u2019t reinspected them. Another 1,200 violations have been cleared.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work in that building to clear these violations,\u201d said Douglas Eisenberg, A&amp;E\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested $10 million into the building.\u201d\nIt has apparently been years since Ari Stark \u2014 a landlord who was once\njailed\nfor neglecting his properties \u2014 has even put 10 cents into his Greene Avenue building. That the city took his building off the bad-boy list and put Douglas Eisenberg\u2019s on it tells you there\u2019s more than a little theater going on.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Mark Levine, the new city comptroller, dial back the\nproject-hampering 485x rules\njust proposed by his office? The draft rules were largely prepared under Levine\u2019s predecessor, Brad Lander, who claimed to be\npro-housing\nbut\nsometimes wasn\u2019t\n, and this proposal is another example. Levine is\nmore enthusiastic\nabout adding housing supply and now has a chance to prove it, though doing so will irk the construction unions. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Only 13.7 percent of single-family homes are occupied by renters, the lowest share in more than 15 years, a Redfin\nanalysis\nof census data found. Housing myth-buster Jay Parsons\nposted\nthe stat.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe\nnew law\nrequiring landlords to install air-conditioning by June 2030 for tenants who request it has been deemed by some as another nail in the coffin of rent-stabilized housing.\nBut a closer reading of the bill suggests its impact will be modest, perhaps even minimal.\nOne line says, \u201cThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development would provide notice to tenants to characterize the potential impacts of opting into the program on their rent.\u201d\nThe law says a rent-stabilized tenant would have to consent to a rent increase \u2014 via an individual apartment improvement \u2014 to get air conditioning. This key fact was\nmissing\nfrom nearly all of the\nmedia coverage\nof the bill.\nFor units that are individually metered, as most are, tenants would also have to pay higher electricity bills to use the A/C. The prospect of higher rent and higher utility bills should dissuade many from demanding the upgrade.\nThe New York Apartment Association pushed for changes to the legislation by Council member Lincoln Restler, D-Brooklyn, which passed 40 to 7 on Dec. 18. It became law without Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 signature.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$37.25 million\nfor a 3,703-square-foot resale condominium at 220 Central Park South. Manju Jasty with The Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$40 million\nfor Metropolitan College of New York\u2019s 100,000-square-foot property at 40 Rector Place in the Financial District.\nThe Real Deal\nreported\non the deal to the City University of New York in August.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condominium unit at 275 West 10th Street in the West Village. Jessica Chestler and Ben Jacobs of Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 210,689-square-foot, four-story, 32-unit residential building at 2105 Tillotson Ave in Eastchester. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Tucker Shane of 33 Equities Acquires.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Facing a tidal wave of resident opposition, representatives for billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Miami Beach delayed a crucial vote on his plan to renovate the iconic waterfront resort\u2019s pool amenities.\nThe Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board was scheduled Tuesday to approve or deny Fontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s application to add cabanas and waterslides at the 1,593-room hotel at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n. Instead, the board voted 6-0 to table the item until a later date at the owner\u2019s request because a seventh board member, Haskel Meyer, was absent.\n\u201cThe Fontainebleau team was fully prepared to present the proposal and welcomed the opportunity for dialogue,\u201d a spokesperson for the resort said in a statement. \u201cBut requested a deferral so the full board could be present to consider the item during a future meeting this summer.\u201d\nThe Miami Beach City Commission chambers, where the board meets, was packed with residents holding signs opposing the project, outnumbering a phalanx of Fontainebleau Miami Beach supporters in blue T-shirts. Videos obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshowed two Miami Beach police officers and a security guard ushering away residents who demanded the item be considered.\n\u201cAsking for a deferral because of one missing board member was an excuse,\u201d Alicia Casanova told\nThe Real Deal\nafter the meeting.\nShe suggested Fontainebleau Miami Beach officials \u201cgot scared of losing. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\nCasanova is president of the master condo association for the Blue Diamond and Green Diamond, two condominiums near Fontainebleau Miami Beach.\nAnamarie Ferreira de Melo, president of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association, said a majority of the organization\u2019s members oppose Fontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s plan because they believe it will add more traffic and negatively impact a planned infrastructure project on Collins Avenue.\n\u201cMBNA has always supported development that is compatible and that is thoughtful for our community,\u201d Ferreira de Melo said. \u201cFor this one, we\u2019re unable to do so. Of course, traffic is something that gets everybody very upset. It\u2019s a trigger for anyone who lives in Mid-Beach.\u201d\nThis marks the third time the board has delayed a vote on the pool amenities plan. In November, the board voted for a deferral to give\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\ntime to meet with opposing residents and neighborhood associations to address criticisms about the planned renovation, which entails a cabana structure and an aluminum waterslide tower.\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\nrepresentatives presented an updated plan to the MidBeach Neighborhood Association last month showing the cabana structure was reduced from two stories to 1.4 stories, and the waterslide tower\u2019s height was slashed to 99 feet tall from 131 feet tall.\nHowever, a majority of residents who attended the presentation were unfazed, and continued to criticize the planned renovation. Miami Beach Mayor\nSteven Meiner\nalso spoke out against the proposal even though the city commission will not get to vote on it.\nFollowing the neighborhood meeting, Fontainebleau Miami Beach requested a second deferral to this month.\nSince then, Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based firm\nFontainebleau Development\nhas implemented a public relations campaign similar to that of a project on public land requiring voter approval. The developer hired political consultant Christian Ulvert to run the campaign. Ulvert managed the campaign for Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins, who won in a runoff in December. He also managed Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava\u2019s runs in 2020 and 2024.\nFontainebleau Development also retained Miami-based polling firm MDW Communications to survey 305 Miami Beach voters last month. According to the poll\u2019s results, 39 percent of the respondents said they had heard a little about the pool renovation and another 24 percent had heard a lot about it. The remainder had not heard anything about it, the poll results show.\nWhen provided details about the project, 31 percent of the respondents said they strongly support it, 27 percent said they somewhat support it, 18 percent said they strongly oppose it, 11 percent said they somewhat oppose it and 12 percent had no opinion.\n\u201cThe Fontainebleau proposal is about reinvesting in one of Miami Beach\u2019s most iconic landmarks in a way that honors its history while preparing it for the future,\u201d the spokesperson\u2019s statement said. \u201cAll while maintaining the property\u2019s existing footprint, without increasing density or adding traffic.\u201d\nMark Weiss, a Miami Beach-based attorney who has been a leading critic, dismissed the campaign as \u201cmanufactured propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cThe swell of opposition is like something never before seen,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThe manufactured fake public support vanished very quickly and ran for the hills.\u201d",

        "content": "Rodeo Drive could get more orange after a record-setting retail acquisition on the world-famous corridor.\nHerm\u00e8s has been revealed as\nthe buyer behind\nwhat Wall Street Journal said is the largest-ever retail real estate purchase on Rodeo Drive, the publication\nreported\n. The luxury French brand spent $400 million to buy 338 North Rodeo Drive, picking up the roughly 25,000-square-foot location\nlast summer\nas part of its acquisition of an affiliate of former owner ECA Capital Limited.\nThe storefronts are currently occupied by Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga. Herm\u00e8s\u2019 plans for the site are not clear, though it might be a while before an Herm\u00e8s store can open there, as the current tenants still maintain leases with several years left. Herm\u00e8s already has a store a block away at 434 North Rodeo Drive, though it\u2019s about half the size of the 338 North Rodeo site.\nThe deal is believed to be the second-priciest sale in Beverly Hills history after British developers Nicholas and Christian Candy spent $500 million for a former Robinsons-May department store at 9900 Wilshire Boulevard in 2007. The 338 North Rodeo sale sets a one-property record for the Rodeo retail corridor.\nOther significant purchases on the street in recent years include\nLVMH\n\u2019s $245 million purchase of a 22,300-square-foot, two-story building at 468 North Rodeo, hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s $200 million sale of a 43,000-square-foot hotel and retail site at 360 North Rodeo and Crown Equity\u2019s\nsale of two storefronts\nspanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for $122 million.\nHerm\u00e8s already owns its store\u2019s current Rodeo Drive location, which it purchased in 2011 for $75 million as its first U.S. real estate acquisition, Luxury Retail Market\nreported\n. The brand rents many of its other store locations, including its New York City flagship on Madison Avenue.\nSince the pandemic, retailers have increasingly had to compete for real estate in Beverly Hills as luxury companies have been purchasing properties and leaving less available space for others. Asking rent prices have increased nearly 50 nearly since 2019, per CBRE data cited by the Journal. \u201cWhat you see now on Rodeo Drive is not only a commitment by the luxury brands that are able to buy their real estate, but you\u2019re seeing the buildings get much bigger,\u201d Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs, who brokered the 338 North Rodeo deal, told WSJ.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Landlord Trinity Flood is fighting to hang onto the South Shore apartment complex federal authorities raided last fall by trying to fend off her lender\u2019s foreclosure, even after a judge\nappointed a receiver\nto take over the building and\nordered remaining tenants to move\nout due to dangerous living conditions.\nThe Wisconsin-based investor\u2019s latest legal maneuvers add to a growing history of tense litigation she has brought in the past eight years against multiple people she has worked alongside and negotiated with in the real estate industry, including her own immediate Flood family members who have decades of investment experience in the mobile homes sector,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFlood\u2019s 130-unit Chicago property at 7500 South South Shore Drive made international headlines in October when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agencies led a military-style raid on the property, descending from helicopters and emerging from unmarked cars to detain migrants living in the building. Tenants at the time said that agents detained nearly every person in the building, including U.S. citizens, during the raid. Some were released while others were sent to immigration detention.\nLegal experts have since\nquestioned whether the raid violated federal search and seizure laws\nand the\nstate of Illinois opened an investigation\ninto whether or not the Wisconsin-based landlord or the property management company she hired, Chicago-based Strength in Management, tipped off ICE.\nThe probe centers on claims that Flood or the property management company requested the raid to coerce Black and Hispanic residents \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 into moving out, which could constitute a violation of state housing discrimination laws. The state opened the investigation last month and it is still ongoing.\nTrouble at the South Shore Drive property\nbegan escalating\nin 2024 when Flood stopped hiring security, squatters began occupying empty units and criminal activity ticked up within the building. It\u2019s unclear, however, if any of the crimes that took place at the property can be tied back to the detained migrants specifically. Federal prosecutors haven\u2019t filed any criminal charges against anyone who was arrested during the raid, ProPublica reported last week.\nMeanwhile, Flood has been\nfighting a foreclosure lawsuit\nfiled by Wells Fargo, which is serving as the trustee for bondholders of a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan tied to 7500 South South Shore Drive as well as two other multifamily properties in Chicago, three in Georgia and one in Arizona. Wells Fargo filed three separate foreclosure lawsuits in each state to address Flood\u2019s default on the loan, which occurred several months before the raid.\nThe Georgia and Arizona cases are much further along in the foreclosure process. The three Georgia properties were auctioned off in November and are now owned by Wells Fargo entities, CMBS loan tracking service Morningstar Credit reported last month. An auction date for the Arizona property is in the process of being scheduled, according to Morningstar.\nBut Flood is battling in court to maintain control of her remaining three properties in Chicago. She and her attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIn a motion filed in Cook County Circuit Court last week, Flood doubled down on the argument that a lender-placed insurance policy on her three Chicago buildings dramatically increased her operating costs and led her to default on her loan payments.\nFlood claims that in 2023, she was paying $93,000 a year to insure the three South Side buildings. In 2024, Wells Fargo\u2019s loan servicer required Flood to take out a new policy that cost over $100,000 per month, resulting in a 977 percent increase to Flood\u2019s insurance costs for the buildings. The plan was based on artificially inflated property values, she claims.\nWells Fargo, however, alleges that the insurance costs are appropriate and that loan servicer K-Star had to issue lender-placed insurance for the properties because Flood had allowed her coverage to lapse and failed to secure a new policy.\nWells Fargo is also pushing to get a receiver appointed to the other two apartment buildings in Flood\u2019s Chicago portfolio at 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, a new filing submitted last week shows. Representatives of Wells Fargo and its attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe other two Chicago properties haven\u2019t drawn as much scrutiny as the South Shore Drive building but have faced building code violations. A fire at the Clyde Avenue property in 2021 injured four people including a Chicago firefighter.\nFlood\u2019s efforts to hang onto the trio of Chicago buildings despite legal headwinds follows a pattern of aggressive tactics she has deployed to establish her career in real estate.\nFamily drama\nPrior to Flood\u2019s purchase of the South Side buildings, people familiar with the deal said she wasn\u2019t well-known among industry insiders in Chicago.\nBut a 2018 lawsuit filed in Wisconsin lends context to her real estate background.\nAbout a year before Flood bought the Chicago, Georgia and Arizona properties, a Neenah, Wisconsin-based woman with the same name had a contentious falling out with her brother and father, court records show.\nSources familiar with the situation confirmed that the woman who filed the Wisconsin lawsuit is the same person who bought the Chicago, Georgia and Arizona properties. Documents related to the purchase and the family legal dispute both list Trinity Flood as a resident of Neenah, Wisconsin, a town with a population of about 27,000 people, according to the U.S. Census.\nTrinity Flood sued her father, Mark Flood, and brother, Eric Flood, in 2018 over a series of business-related disputes tied to their third-generation mobile home business in Wisconsin, called Flood Homes, legal filings show. Mark Flood and Eric Flood as well as their attorneys didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nTrinity Flood claimed at the time she was wrongfully terminated from Flood Homes by Mark Flood \u201cwithout any prior notice,\u201d and that she was told she \u201ccannot have contact with Flood Homes Inc., employees.\u201d\nIn her lawsuit, Trinity Flood asked a Wisconsin judge to dissolve several LLCs in which she shared ownership with Mark and Eric Flood and to oversee the liquidation of assets held by the shared LLCs. She alleged that under one of the entities, Mark was in default on a commercial loan, which justified the dissolution of the entity.\nBut attorneys for both Eric Flood and Mark Flood fired back, alleging that Trinity was \u201casked to avoid interactions with employees of Flood Homes, Inc. as certain employees had complained of [Trinity\u2019s] oppressive and harassing treatment, raising potential liability issues.\u201d\nMark Flood alleged that Trinity Flood filed the lawsuit \u201cin bad faith and for self-interested motives in an attempt to break up the family business which has been in operation for more than 65 years,\u201d and that she is \u201cattempting to force Mark Flood and Eric Flood to sell their personal interests in the business to satisfy her own selfish motives.\u201d\nHe also claimed that Trinity Flood \u201chas taken steps to secretly market the Flood businesses for sale with brokers, including those in business entities in which she has no controlling interest \u2026 and \u201cwrongfully interfered or attempted to interfere with the relationship between Mark and Eric Flood\u201d and third parties, including key lenders and service providers.\nIn his response, Eric Flood\u2019s attorneys added that he was more qualified to oversee business operations than Trinity Flood, and prior to the lawsuit she had tried to sabotage their shared business efforts by \u201cinterfering with lenders and loans\u201d not related to the LLCs named in the lawsuit, and by \u201cintentionally over-leveraging the legal entities with the intentions to depreciate the value.\u201d\n\u201cTrinity Flood has refused to make decisions and/or has engaged in actions or inaction that place business operations and business relationships and the personal investments of Mark Flood and Eric Flood at risk,\u201d Eric Flood\u2019s filing stated.\nThe case was settled with an out-of-court agreement in January 2019.\nOther legal strategies\nAbout a year after the dust settled with Eric and Mark Flood, Trinity Flood assembled a portfolio of apartment buildings in Chicago, Georgia and Arizona. A loan backed by the seven properties was packaged together in a $25 million CMBS offering.\nShortly after she bought the Chicago properties, she filed a lawsuit accusing\nseller Daniel Hedaya of DAX Real Estate\nand his brokers, Aaron Sklar and Noah Birk of Chicago-based Kiser Group, of improperly inflating the property\u2019s values. For the three South Side properties, she had paid $18 million.\nIn the suit, Flood called out the conditions of the South Shore Drive property, where the unsettling raid would later take place, including the need for around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly. She claimed the prior owner didn\u2019t make her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nFlood pointed out the three-building Chicago portfolio had last sold for $11 million in 2017 prior to DAX\u2019s renovations. She alleged the brokers told her the jump in value was due to the improvements and increase in occupancy at the buildings. Hedaya told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2019 that his firm spent \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d on the projects.\nBut at 7500 South Shore, Flood claimed she had been told that all units in the building were renovated when in reality, 21 had been left untouched. She further alleged that the scope of the renovations throughout the building had been exaggerated or misstated.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023.\nBy then, Flood was racking up significant city code violations on the South Side buildings. She has been issued fines for Clyde and Chappel Avenue properties and a lis pendens foreclosure that the city filed against Flood regarding code violations at the South Shore Drive property is still pending as the case plays out in court.\n",

The site, at 5055 Telegraph Avenue, spans 14,370 square feet and is located across the street from a\nWhole Foods Market\nat 5110 Telegraph Avenue.\nIt would be the second Oakland location for\nEmeryville\n-based Grocery Outlet.

        "content": "A piece of presidential lineage is quietly hitting the Austin leasing market.\nLuci Baines Johnson, the daughter of former President\nLyndon B. Johnson\n, placed her former two-story penthouse in downtown Austin\u2019s Norwood Tower up for lease, opening the door for a wide range of potential uses \u2014 from restaurant and hospitality concepts to office or residential space, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 10,421-square-foot penthouse spans the 14th and 15th floors of the historic structure at 117 West Seventh Street, a 1929 landmark that once stood as\nAustin\u2019s\ntallest building outside of the Texas Capitol. The Johnson family purchased the building in 1997, and later converted the top floors from office space into a private home.\nAustin-based ECR brokers Jason Steinberg and Patrick Ley are marketing the space, which is being pitched less as a traditional lease and more as a flexible canvas for creative users.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a square box where you drop in workstations,\u201d said John Jordan,\nthe Johnson family\u2019s\nlongtime asset manager.\nHe told the publication that interest has already come from office, hospitality and restaurant groups, though the family is keeping an open mind.\n\u201cWhether it continues to be residential or morphs into something different is what we\u2019re taking our time to be thoughtful about,\u201d Jordan said.\nThe penthouse includes elevator access to both floors, internal stairs to a private gym on the 16th floor and six private terraces. Other features include a small chapel, a full kitchen, on-site parking and direct access to Perry\u2019s Steakhouse &amp; Grille on the ground floor.\nJohnson once described the penthouse as her \u201ccastle in the sky,\u201d though living downtown was not the original plan. After buying Norwood Tower, the family intended to house its business operations there.\n\u201cHow can we ask other people to come downtown if we\u2019re living out in Westlake?\u201d Johnson recalled asking herself. That question ultimately drove the decision to renovate the top floors into a home.\nThat decision proved prescient as Austin\u2019s urban core took off. During her time there, Johnson said the building felt anything but lonely, serving as a hub for family offices, political gatherings, charitable events and personal milestones.\nNow living at the\nFour Seasons Residences\nalong Lady Bird Lake, Johnson said she hopes the next chapter for the Norwood Tower penthouse carries a similar civic-minded spirit.\n\u201cThese are challenging times for development in Austin,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whoever comes there, I hope they\u2019ll treasure being a chapter of Austin\u2019s history.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nadim Ashi is closing on the buyout of a waterfront West Palm Beach condo building, securing a prime development site across from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club.\nThe buyout of Harbor Towers, which sources say will total about $100 million, also marks a victory for Ashi over Steve Ross.\nThe\ntwo industry titans went head-to-head\nin a legal battle over control of the 2-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive last year. With Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners poised to take control of the majority of units, Ross sued in April, demanding an injunction to block termination of the condo.\nAshi\u2019s attorney Glen Waldman described the legal maneuver as a standard block play, a natural byproduct of the intense competition for West Palm Beach\u2019s limited waterfront sites.\n\u201cEvery time you have big boys playing in the sandbox \u2026 they fight, and that\u2019s what they do,\u201d he said in an October interview. \u201cThey\u2019re not scared to fight.\u201d\nThe scrap seemed poised to get ugly in the fall, with Ashi\u2019s lawyers alleging underhanded tactics and seeking to depose Ross and his executives. The parties ultimately\nreached a settlement in October\n, allowing Ashi to move forward with his condo termination at Harbor Towers.\n\u201cThese owners were making so much money,\u201d Waldman said of the payout for unit owners. \u201cThere are no losers here.\u201d\nWaldman declined to comment on the final closings for this story, but Douglas Elliman agent Jessica Julian confirmed the buyout is a boon for sellers. She would know \u2013\u2013 she was among the unit owners to sell to Fort Partners. She also helped cut the deals between the developer and the rest of her neighbors, something that landed her in Related Ross\u2019 lawsuit last year.\nShe declined to comment on the total sellout price, but said the average price per unit worked out to about $1.4 million.\n\u201cI told my neighbors, \u2018Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth,\u2019\u201d she said, describing early days courting Harbor Towers owners.\nJulian described a first wave of eager sellers who \u201cwanted to take the money and run,\u201d followed by months of angst and hostility between neighbors and the two bidding developers.\n\u201cWe were in a little bit of a war zone,\u201d she said.\nWith the last units closing, Ashi now controls the contiguous waterfront sites at 3901 South Flagler Drive, 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive. He paid $20 million for the other two properties in November, records show.\nWhile Ashi won out at Harbor Towers, he lost to Steve Ross\u2019 bid for the neighboring Southbridge condos at 3915 South Flagler Drive. The billionaire Related Ross chairman closed on\na $25.4 million bulk buy of units\nin the building earlier this month. It marked a major payday for investor Joey Columbo who quietly bought up 43 percent of the units in the years prior, anticipating that a developer would come knocking.\nAlso this month, Gilbert Benhamou\u2019s\nImmocorp Capital offered $202 million\nto buy out the 140-unit South Portofino Condominium, which is adjacent to Harbor Towers.\nJulian said she\u2019s getting a lot of calls from developers interested in buying aging buildings.\nBut she\u2019s also starting to see hesitation from some developers concerned about prices and market saturation. If unit owners are interested in selling in this current wave of investment, she said, \u201cThey might want to be a bit more reasonable [with prices].\u201d",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland Chair\nLori Hyland\nturned the page in 2025 with a new office and, more recently, a fresh face to serve as the Beverly Hills firm\u2019s broker manager,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe appointment of Felix Pena, who has been with\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nfor over 20 years, comes after former managing director\nSteve Katz\nquietly exited the brokerage after a little over a year in the position.\nHyland called Pena, who is also a non-practicing attorney, an \u201cexceptional broker\u201d who knows Hilton &amp; Hyland \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very fond of Steve and we wish him the best,\u201d Hyland told\nTRD\non Tuesday. \u201cHe was a wonderful presence.\u201d\nKatz did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\nHyland said Katz officially left the brokerage about a month ago. State Department of Real Estate records show a Jan. 30 end to his time as broker associate with the company and no move of his license to a new firm.\nKatz joined Hilton &amp; Hyland in December 2024 during a time of transition within its executive ranks. About a week before Katz was announced as the brokerage\u2019s new managing director, Hilton &amp; Hyland saw former President\nDavid Kramer\n, along with his six-person team, decamp to Compass\u2019 Beverly Hills office. Kramer\u2019s group, with $1.7 billion in career sales, left to focus on sales.\nAt the time of Katz\u2019s appointment, Hilton &amp; Hyland said the executive would work with Hyland and former General Counsel Chrystal Ferber as a trio managing the firm\u2019s day-to-day operations and overseeing business strategy.\nFerber, who left the brokerage last April, called Katz\u2019s appointment \u201cnot just an appointment \u2013 it\u2019s a statement.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the brokerage has continued to see agent departures. Hyland confirmed the firm\u2019s headcount currently sits at around 25, which is a significant cut from the over 100 agents and staff that made up the roster in 2018 when the company moved into its now former office at 257 North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.\nThere was also last year\u2019s tussle with Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former\nlandlord\n, Standard Oil Investment Group. The property owner\nsued the brokerage\nfor more than $650,000 in unpaid rent on the Canon Drive space in a lawsuit that appears to be winding down. The landlord asked a judge to approve a request for the case\u2019s dismissal in November. Meanwhile, the end of 2025 saw Hilton &amp; Hyland leave the Standard Oil Building for a smaller footprint at 345 North Maple Drive, which Hyland told\nTRD\nat the time had nothing to do with the rent dispute.\nDespite the downsized office space, Hyland said they\u2019re interviewing agents.\n\u201cAnybody that has a good reputation, good track record and has a good portfolio of properties, we welcome,\u201d she said.\nHyland is the wife of the late Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Jeff Hyland, who started the company with Rick Hilton in 1993.\nEven with changes at the brokerage and what some might call a rugged stretch for the business, Lori Hyland said she and, now Pena, are committed to continuing on with the business.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been associated with this for all my life being Jeff\u2019s wife,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cHe founded it some 30 years ago, so we just want to continue to do business. Hilton &amp; Hyland is associated with luxury real estate, and this is what we want to continue doing.\u201d\n",

        "content": "For nearly a decade, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse was one of the most closely guarded homes in New York.\nNewly released Justice Department documents show how Epstein tightly controlled access to the sprawling, off-market mansion, demanding buyer names, rejecting offers he deemed too low and expressing suspicion of ulterior motives. Locked out of one of the city\u2019s most notorious properties, agents dangled the names of billionaires, oligarchs and financiers in hopes of securing a showing. The bar for who was granted access to the townhouse \u2014 later revealed to be the site of much of Epstein\u2019s abuse of young women \u2014 was not just high, but often arbitrary, shaped as much by Epstein\u2019s ego as by any realistic prospect of a sale.\nBrokers paraded a procession of ultra-wealthy would-be buyers in an effort to unlock the front door, to little avail. Even Ben Ashkenazy, the billionaire developer behind a roughly $10 billion portfolio, was dismissed as \u201cnot rich enough.\u201d Others tried name-dropping foreign oligarchs \u2014 including one pitch promising \u201cmy very wealthy Russians.\u201d And when hedge funder and Mets owner Steve Cohen surfaced in broker paperwork, Epstein responded not with a showing, but by suggesting a \u201csting.\u201d\n\u2018My very wealthy Russians\u2019\nThe correspondence captures a strange audition process, as brokers cycled through names and pitches while Epstein and his aides decided who was worth letting inside.\nIn 2016, when Jed Garfield, who runs the boutique brokerage Leslie Garfield, approached an associate of Epstein\u2019s about showing the home at 9 East 71st Street to Ashkenazy, Epstein\nwrote\nback: \u201ctell jed [sorry] not rich enough.\u201d\nEpstein also appears to have turned down Michael Lehrman, who heads up Newmark\u2019s European group, and former Stephens CEO and current Ambassador to the United Kingdom Warren Stephens, emails show.\n\u201cMr Epstein can only assume the buyers are mere tire kickers,\u201d Epstein\u2019s assistant wrote to Garfield when he tried to bring Stephens by in 2010. \u201cYour previous clients never bid, so we are kind of wary.\u201d\nIn rare instances, Epstein allowed Garfield to show the home to some of his wealthy clients. In 2014 Garfield arranged a showing for one of the \u201cCandy brothers,\u201d presumably referring to real estate tycoons Nick and Christian Candy, and in 2015 for Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, also known as Miles Kwok, who was later arrested in the United States for tax fraud.\nA spokesperson for Nick Candy confirmed that he toured the house in 2014, but the visit \u201cdid not result in any relationship, business dealings, or subsequent contact of any kind.\u201d\nAgents rarely communicated with Epstein directly, instead liaising with his cadre of advisors and assistants who relayed his thoughts on potential buyers and showings. Epstein also issued specific instructions for readying the house ahead of showings, including taking down photographs on the third floor \u2014 later identified by a New York Times\ninvestigation\nas the location of his bedroom and massage room, which were filled with images of naked women.\n\u201cJE just informed me [that] Jed Garfield will be showing 71st to someone on Friday at 11am\u2026Can we please make sure that the photos on 3rd floor are taken down as well,\u201d read an\nemail\nrelated to a showing in December 2011, where the sender is redacted.\nGarfield declined to comment on the emails.\nOther agents tried to get in on the action as well. In 2010, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman emailed an Epstein\u2019s assistant claiming to have \u201ctwo good prospects,\u201d presumably referring to buyers for his townhouse. Epstein responded to his assistant, \u201cno interest.\u201d\nBoardman did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn some cases, brokers tried to bypass the process by leaning on name recognition. In 2016, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Steinberg emailed Epstein\u2019s accountant with a \u201clongshot\u201d proposal of showing the home to two separate Russian oligarchs, Abramovich and Alexi Kuzmichev.\n\u201cWould Mr. Epstein consider showing two of my very wealthy Russians who I have sold two of the most expensive townhouses in New York to his home,\u201d Steinberg\nwrote\n.\nBut eight years later, Steinberg said those names were likely no more than a ploy to get in the door.\n\u201cI wanted to give myself credibility, because I imagined he would have gotten calls from 100 brokers trying to get access into the house,\u201d Steinberg told\nTRD\n.\n\u201cThey never looked at it, they were never interested,\u201d he said of the Russians.\n\u2018Let\u2019s set up a sting\u2019\nOne peculiar interaction revolved around yet another billionaire put forward as a potential buyer: Steve Cohen.\nA\ndocument\ndated May 5, 2010 shows \u201cSteven A. Cohen\u201d as a prospective buyer in a right-to-sell agreement sent to Epstein by Brown Harris Stevens. The document, which doesn\u2019t show a countersignature from Epstein, allowed BHS agent Brian Manning to show the property to Cohen through June 2010.\nNearly everybody involved in the emails around a potential showing for Cohen denied that he was interested in the property.\n\u201cAt no point did Steve or any authorized representative visit the property or express interest in purchasing it,\u201d a spokesperson for Cohen said in a statement.\nHall Wilkie, who was president of Brown Harris Stevens at the time and whose name appeared at the bottom of the document, said he never knew that Cohen was a potential buyer of Epstein\u2019s townhouse, and that he never personally toured the house. But Willkie\u2019s signature appears on a previous right-to-sell agreement for the property sent on April 30, 2010 that does not reveal Cohen\u2019s identity.\nEpstein did not appear to believe Cohen was a real buyer. \u201cHave Brian manning [confirm] in writing that his buyer that he represents is steve cohen,\u201d Epstein wrote to his accountant, Richard Kahn, the morning of May 5.\nEpstein went so far as to suggest that the tour was a ploy for \u201ceither thieves or investigators trying to get into the house\u201d in another email copying Kahn that day. When Kahn asked if he should schedule a viewing of the home if Manning did confirm Cohen\u2019s identity, Epstein\nreplied\n\u201cno, lets set up a sting.\u201d He didn\u2019t provide any other details on what a sting would entail.\nA house not for sale\nEpstein never sold the property while he was alive, likely because he sought eye-popping prices upward of $150 million, according to emails and interviews with agents familiar with the discussions. It was not until his death in 2019 \u2014 and as the full scope of his abuse became public \u2014 that the estate listed the home for $88 million with the Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin. The mansion ultimately sold for $51 million in 2021 to financier Michael Daffey, after the asking price was cut to $65 million.\nEpstein, who died by suicide 2019 while awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges, appeared to take over home in the mid-1990s from his longtime friend and mentor, Les Wexner.\nWho Epstein approved to see the home and what offers he would contemplate seemed to be an ever-changing threshold. In 2016, when Steinberg suggested showing Abramovich and Kuzmichev the home for $150 million, Epstein told his accountant: \u201c[Tell] him that roman already saw the house and i have turned down 250 m.\u201d\nEpstein repeated similar claims throughout the years.\nIn 2012, James Meiskin, at the time the head of real estate advisory firm Plymouth Partners, told Epstein\u2019s assistant that Russian financier Andrei Vavilov could write a check \u201cfor $100 million or so\u201d for the house. Epstein\nresponded\nby saying, \u201ci have already turned down three bids in the TWO hundreds.\u201d\nThe next year, Epstein had Garfield\nrelay\nto Nick Candy that he had \u201cturned down 240m.\u201d And in 2015, Garfield arranged a showing for Guo Wengui after offering to \u201cshow him the house at 250 million.\u201d Although Garfield later hinted Candy might consider bidding, Candy never made an offer on the property, according to his spokesperson.\nBut in 2009, Epstein quoted Garfield a price of $120 million for a showing, half of what he was asking just a few years later. Agents who had shown Epstein\u2019s home said there was no chance he had received offers over $200 million.\n\u201cThat is probably, absolutely BS,\u201d one agent said in response to questions about offers of that size. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d said another.\nMultiple sources confirmed that Epstein did receive an offer for roughly $125 million around 2010, which he turned down.\n\u201cWith Epstein, it was always a higher number,\u201d said one of the brokers familiar with the offer. The broker said Epstein shot back a counter around $175 million, which made it \u201cpretty clear he wasn\u2019t a seller. It was already an above-market transaction by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\nDespite Epstein\u2019s apparent aversion to selling, other emails show a fixation on the Upper East Side townhouse market.\nEpstein\u2019s associates sent him articles from\nTRD\n, Curbed NY and other local outlets about townhouses in the area, including a story on art heir David Wildenstein selling his townhouse for a then-record $79.5 million in 2017 and a $48 million townhouse listing in 2012. In 2014, one of Boardman\u2019s team members put together a list of off-market townhouses for Epstein\u2019s review.\nEpstein also appeared to be particularly interested in Cohen\u2019s real estate dealings. In 2017, Kahn\nsent\nEpstein a\nTRD\narticle about Cohen\ncutting the price of his One Beacon Court\napartment by 50 percent.\nIn 2019, just five months before Epstein\u2019s arrest, Kahn shared another article about Cohen again cutting the price.\n\u201cWaited too long,\u201d Epstein\nresponded\n.\n",

        "content": "A nearly century-old office building near Millennium Park is the latest Chicago Loop property angling for a second act.\nThe 17-story building at 70 East Lake Street is up for sale, with Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing the 1927 building as a candidate for apartments or a hotel conversion, according to offering materials. CoStar first\nreported\nthat the property, designed with gothic revival and art deco influences, is about 63 percent leased as offices.\nBrokers Kelsey Berry, Cody Hundertmark, Dirk Riekse and Tom Sitz are pitching the deal as a chance to buy the property for roughly $10 million to $12 million and reposition it, according to a person familiar with the offering. All but two of the existing leases include landlord termination rights, giving a buyer a relatively clear path to vacate the building and start over.\nThe seller, a family office represented locally by Chicago-based\nAnsonia Properties\n, has owned the tower since 1993, when it paid $3.1 million for the property, according to Cook County records. The building was last financed with a $6 million loan in 2017.\nThe offering adds to a growing pile of aging,\nhalf-empty office buildings\nin downtown Chicago being shopped for their conversion potential, as demand for workspace remains historically weak. Investors are increasingly hunting for low bases and flexible tenancy that make the math work for residential or hospitality reuse, according to the publication.\nThe Lake Street address sits in the heart of the Loop\u2019s tourism corridor, surrounded by North Michigan Avenue retail and some of the city\u2019s largest hotels. Next door is the teal\n\u201cRolls-Royce Garage\u201d\nat 60 East Lake Street, the Stanley Tigerman-designed parking structure that traded last year to Toronto-based Clermont for just under $12.4 million. A few feet away, the original Virgin Hotels outpost is being redeveloped into a\nSports Illustrated-branded timeshare\nresort.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The proposal includes a public parking garage for local businesses as well as a separate garage for residents. The city is also considering two other applications: one from\nAlliant Communities\nand another from a joint venture of\nRelated California\nand Alta Housing.\nMenlo Park officials will hold an open house for residents and local business owners to view displays of all the proposals and see presentations about the projects at a city council meeting in March. The city is expected to choose a proposal in April or May.\nAside from Presidio Bay\u2019s downtown endeavor, locals have been opposed to the City of Menlo Park\u2019s efforts to add housing in downtown Menlo Park due to a loss of parking.\nPresidio Bay\u2019s 670-unit project at 345 Middlefield Road would redevelop a 17-acre site occupied by 16 buildings, currently including a 20,000-square-foot laboratory facility once home to a U.S. Geological Survey office and the GeoKids child care center. Presidio Bay purchased the building from the General Services Administration\nlast year for $137 million\n. Plans call for three apartment buildings, four office buildings, 40,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, a new child care center and a dog park.\nPresidio Bay has already broken into the Menlo Park market.

Funds managed by\nFortress Investment Group\noriginated and arranged the debt.\nJasper was built in 2023 and rises seven stories above South Grand Avenue. The Fortress loan will help bolster ongoing leasing efforts at the property and refinance roughly $80 million in construction debt provided by Acore Capital in 2023. Fortress opted to provide the Jasper financing as the lender looks to support \u201chigh-quality, newly built multifamily housing backed by an experienced sponsor with significant equity invested.\u201d\nMultifamily occupancy in the downtown Los Angeles area has remained strong while office vacancies and\ndistress\nsince the pandemic have continued to pose problems. Last year, multifamily occupancy reached nearly 91 percent, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, per Lee &amp; Associates data cited by CO.\nJamison is among those firms that have attracted lender interest in its downtown housing projects. Last month, the Koreatown-based company\nsecured a $195 million construction loan\ntied to the former Arco tower at 1055 West Seventh Street. Jamison is slated to convert the 33-story, roughly 620,000-square-foot office building into 686 residential units, making it the largest adaptive reuse project in Los Angeles history, according to CO. Construction on that project began earlier this year.\nCityview is working on an adaptive reuse plan of its own. The developer is\nplanning to redevelop\nthe two-building Newport summit office complex in Irvine into 422 units of housing.

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the 246,955-square-foot building, formerly known as the Atlas Energy Tower, will be rebranded 12001 NCX.

Built in 1984, the tower is known for its prominent signage along the Central Expressway corridor.\nDallas-based Gutow is buying into a market still sorting through office distress. In December, Denver-based Real Capital Solutions paid $26.1 million for the nearby 18-story\nWalnut Glen\nbuilding, a roughly 64 percent haircut from its $73 million sale price in 2016.\nAt 12001 NCX, Gutow sees upside, as the building is about 50 percent leased, with 15,000 square feet of new leases recently signed and additional deals in negotiation, founder Craig Gutow said in a statement. He pointed to leasing momentum, capital improvements and \u201chands-on ownership\u201d as the path to value creation, according to the outlet.\nThe firm plans to upgrade common areas, refresh amenities and offer fully built-out, move-in ready suites, aiming to attract smaller tenants seeking turnkey space without the upfront construction costs.\nFounded in 2003, Gutow owns office and apartment properties across North Texas, including another building nearby at 9900\nNorth Central Expressway\n.\nDemand in the area is picking up, as Alabama-based insurance brokerage CRC Group announced in January that the firm is consolidating its four Dallas-Fort Worth offices into a single 49,000-square-foot hub at the Lakeside Square office in North Dallas, also within the U.S. 75 and I-635 corridor.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Related Ross is expected to pay $31 million for the eastern portion, while ElevateEd will pay $16 million for the western side, the Town-Crier\nreported\n.\nRelated Ross would build 15 residential units on top of retail as part of phase one, and 200 residential units in phase two, per a village staff report.\nWellington approved construction but delayed a vote to allow ElevateEd to operate a pre-K-12 school, called Wingrove Academy, for 1,750 students, giving the private school operator time to clarify how many scholarships will be reserved for students who live in the village.\nThe developers said last summer they intended to open Wingrove Academy in Wellington\nby 2028\n. It would be the first school in the U.S. for ElevateEd, a company headed by Singapore-based Education In Motion co-founder Karen Yung and business consultant Marianne Rehn.\nWellington, known for its polo fields and farms, has attracted increased attention from developers.\nDeveloper Mark Bellissimo got the green light in August to build the\nMarketplace at Wellington\n, which will include 80 hotel rooms, 89 condo units and 117,000 square feet of commercial space.\nArizona-based\nMeritage Homes\nis seeking zoning to build a 206-townhome complex on 30 acres in the village.\nAlso in Wellington, former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and Discovery Land Company\nnarrowly won the council\u2019s initial approval\nto turn a former polo field into a polo-themed country club development with 40 single-family homes, though it\u2019s far from certain their plans will win final approval.",

Adjacent to the site, MG and New York-based Baron Property Group completed the pair of 10-story buildings with 559 apartments, combined, for their Metro Parc project.\nMG and Baron also are developing Metro Parc North with an\neight-story, 661-unit\nbuilding at 901 East 26th Street.\nMiami Lakes-based Prestige Companies has seized on Hialeah with projects including the three-story, 114-unit\nMarket Station North\ncomplex and a redevelopment of the Hialeah Park Racing &amp; Casino into\nFlamingo Village\n, with a 343-unit apartment complex and a charter school. The site is at 100 East 32nd Street.\nNear Hialeah, Adell Investments, led by Jorge and Julio Quintana, proposed last year the five-story, 108-unit\nHUB Palm Springs North\nbuilding at 17601 and 17775 Northwest 78th Avenue and 7750 Northwest 178th Street. The site is in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\nDevelopers jumped on South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era multifamily boom, defined by unprecedented demand and record rent growth, with plans for new projects. Amid hefty completions in recent years, the influx of out-of-staters slowed, prompting\nslower leaseups\n, an increase in concessions and a drop in rents.\u00a0Yet, developers starting apartment projects now say demand will catch up by the time they finish their buildings partly due to a\ndrop in construction starts\n.\n",

        "content": "Now that a federal bankruptcy judge approved an intramural battle between lenders on Oceanwide Plaza, creditors are facing a decision: Make their own or joint credit bids and try to finish the project or sell it off in hopes of recouping sunk costs, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe decision is imminent, the source said.\nThe project is estimated to require another $1 billion or more to complete.\nThe bankruptcy exit agreement recently\nreached\nover downtown Los Angeles\u2019 problem project clears the way for a potential deal. The latest framework appears to offer the two major creditors an avenue to either bid the debt they\u2019re owed in exchange for the property or sell for cash.\nBloomberg previously reported a potential investor is negotiating to buy the property, and the deal hinged on resolving the bankruptcy.\nUnder the latest agreement, LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, is entitled to a $230-million claim, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor on the project, is in line for another of about $169 million. Other creditors, including one tied to Lendlease, are also in line for claims, per recent filings.\nThe mixed-use, two-million square foot development that sits opposite Crypto.com Arena near the LA Live entertainment hub, has been stalled for years since developer China Oceanwide ran out of money after putting more than a billion dollars into vision of a mixed-use megaproject with office, retail, hotel and residential components. The Beijing-based developer, which has since been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2024. Earlier, when the development stalled, China Oceanwide said it would\nneed another\n$1 billion to complete construction.\nNow the bankrupt developer is looking to sell the bedraggled asset off by making a presumptuous pitch about the priorities of the City of Los Angeles and its residents.\n\u201c\u201cA prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide Plaza said a court filing last month, calling it a \u201chigh-profile civic issue\u201d for the city.\nThe settlement reached among creditors basically put an end to the millions of dollars being spent on lawyers while lenders sued each other. It outlined who got what and at what interest rate.\n\u201cThe settlement agreement puts an immediate stop to this value-destructive litigation, preserving estate assets and allowing the debtor to pivot from endless legal battles to the productive work of selling the project and confirming a plan,\u201d lawyers wrote.\nRepresentatives for LADI, Lendlease and Oceanwide did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n",

Prosecutors claim that the landlords improperly withheld security deposits, imposed rent increases beyond legal limits and charged excessive late fees.\nThe Pirians routinely kept most or all of tenants\u2019 security deposits after they moved out, according to Feldstein Soto\u2019s office. When tenants took issue with the withheld deposits, the landlords allegedly ignored them or told the former renters they would have to go to court to get their money back. The landlords also included a provision in their leases that allowed them to charge late fees equal to 10 percent of the base rent \u2014 an unenforceable penalty under the law, per the complaint.\nIn the height of the pandemic in 2020, Los Angeles implemented tenant protections including an\neviction moratorium\nand\nlimits on rent increases\n. The brothers were allegedly aware that the rent hikes they imposed on tenants were illegal, though the defendants reportedly told renters who complained not to tell others that the increases broke the law, prosecutors claim.\nThe Pirians are also accused of failing to pay required interest on security deposits held for one year or longer, discriminating against tenants based on the method used to receive housing subsidies, unlawfully passing off city fees to tenants and failing to provide legally required contact information for property owners and managers.\nFeldstein Soto\u2019s office is looking to get a court order to stop the alleged illegal activities, secure restitution for affected tenants and impose civil penalties on the landlords.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger and Tom Svoboda are marketing the development site, while Michael Wilson and Christian Williams are handling the retail listing.\nCarlins told the publication that a new partner would not alter\nMagellan\u2019s long-standing vision\nfor a high-rise on the Columbus Drive parcel, known as Parcel O. The site is zoned for up to 574 apartments, 239 hotel rooms and more than 10,000 square feet of retail. Magellan and Hanwha struck a deal last year to bring U.K.-based Hoxton to the project for what would be its second Chicago hotel.\nParcel O is one of the last remaining development sites within the 28-acre Lakeshore East campus, built on a former nine-hole golf course east of the Loop. Since 2002, the master-planned community has reshaped the skyline, most notably with Jeanne Gang\u2019s 82-story\nAqua tower\nand 101-story\nSt. Regis Chicago\n.\nThe zoning predates the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance update, mandating that 20 percent of units in new projects be set aside at below-market rents. Only 33 new parking spaces would be required, with up to 329 spaces available through an easement in Aqua, according to CBRE.\nThe retail portion, known as Village Market, is 89 percent leased and anchored by a multilevel Mariano\u2019s grocery store. Other tenants include Avli on the Park, Eggy\u2019s Diner, Gordo\u2019s Tiny Taco Bar and MingHin Cuisine. The space has a weighted average lease term of roughly 4.5 years.\nMagellan has monetized portions of Lakeshore East before, including a $190.5 million sale of Aqua\u2019s apartment component in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property, which is listed for $8.5 million, hit the market on Feb. 4 and went into contract Feb. 6, according to listing sites. The home was one of last week\u2019s top residences to go into contract, based on asking price, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nProperty records show Danault and Fortin bought the home in 2022 for just under $6 million and lived there while Danault played for the Kings. He left the team last year and made a return to the Montreal Canadiens, where he played between 2016 and 2021.\nThe asking price on the South Bay home, located in the American Martyrs district of\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Tree Section, pencils out to $1,971 per square foot. The roughly 10-block American Martyrs area gets its name from its proximity to the American Martyrs Church and School and is known for sizable lots, including some with ocean views.\nVista Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s June Emerson holds the listing.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom home spans 4,312 square feet. It touts ocean views, a wine cellar, elevator, Tesla charger and parking for five vehicles.\nWhile the\nManhattan Beach\nproperty is headed for what could be a fast closing, it didn\u2019t top last week\u2019s list of homes to go into contract.\nThat designation went to 722 North Camden Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats. The seven-bed, 10-bath home is listed for $21 million, or $1,835 per square foot.\nProperty records indicate Vandad Zarrin and Nahid Chapchian are the owners. Zarrin owns VZ Construction Co., which built the Mediterranean-inspired home last year.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal holds the listing.\nThe home sits on an expansive lot of more than 15,000 square feet. Highlights of the home include a nearly 2,000-square-foot primary suite with its own sitting room and balcony. There\u2019s also a driveway made with Italian marble and each bedroom has its own bathroom. Prospective buyers also had the option of buying the home\u2019s Restoration Hardware furnishings.\nThe Flats property was one of 19 homes to go into contract last week, according to the\nEklund Gomes\nreport. That was good for $114.9 million in asking volume, which was off about 35 percent from the year-ago period.\n",

Large windows overlook rolling pastureland. The property also includes a guest house, pool and pool house, a six-stall barn, indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a helicopter pad, according to the listing.

That\u2019s the greatest decline among the 50 biggest metro areas in the country, surpassing runner-up Washington, D.C., by more than a percentage point. However, absorption rates suggest that demand may consume enough supply to level out the Austin multifamily market by the end of the year.\nRents have been falling in Austin for nearly two years, after a\nmultifamily building spree\nchased the swiftly rising demand for apartment living during the early 2020s. Between 2021 and 2023, average rent in Austin\nrose by more than 30 percent\n. Austin multifamily construction\npeaked in 2024\n, but oversupply continues to depress rents and force landlords to offer concessions that tenants in 2021 couldn\u2019t dream of getting.\nOther primary metropolitan areas in Texas also saw rent declines last month. In San Antonio, already the cheapest place to rent of the top 50 cities nationwide, rent dipped 3 percent in January to $1,076 per month, a 3.2 percent year-over-year decline, CoStar reported. Rent decreased by 2.1 percent in Fort Worth to $1,258 in January. Dallas and Houston had the flattest declines in Texas in January, with average rent decreasing by 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent year-over-year, respectively.\nIt\u2019s not an issue of demand, according to Grant Montgomery, national director of multifamily analytics at CoStar.\n\u201cIn Texas, demand is quite strong. Many of those markets are actually leaders both on absolute absorption of units, as well as the percentage of absorption,\u201d Montgomery said.\nIn the last quarter of 2025, Austin absorbed over 3,100 units, the fifth-largest level of any market in the United States, according to CoStar. Measured as a percentage of its total supply, Austin\u2019s absorption last quarter ranked second in the country at 1 percent, trailing only Charlotte.\nIn light of sustained demand, month-over-month data suggests that rents may soon reach the bottom of the curve. After 19 straight months of decline, Austin posted a marginal increase in rents in January, compared to December. San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston saw similar month-over-month increases.\n\u201cOne data point does not a trend make. [But] this is the first time it has turned positive on a month-over-month basis,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cBy the end of the year, Austin might get back to breakeven on a year-over-year rent basis, which would be a large accomplishment given the headwinds that it\u2019s faced over the last couple of years.\u201d\n",

A filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation pegs the cost of its buildout at $5.6 million, with construction slated to run from January through June. TDLR filings are preliminary, but offer an early look at tenant investment.\nUBS manages roughly $6.6 trillion in assets globally and already has a presence in Dallas-Fort Worth, including offices at The Crescent, Plano and Fort Worth.\nPrivate equity firm Stonelake Capital Partners is also relocating from The Crescent to\n23Springs\n, leasing about 16,000 square feet on the ninth floor. A confidential tenant signed for 22,099 square feet on the 10th floor, with occupancy expected in the third quarter, according to the publication.\nThe leases are notable in an office market still grappling with elevated vacancy. Paul Bennett, Granite\u2019s senior managing director, told the outlet that the tower\u2019s momentum reflects demand for top-tier buildings in prime locations.

It is set to be completed this month.\nGranite broke ground after buying the Cedar Springs and Maple Avenue site in 2012 and demolishing existing structures in 2022. Bank OZK provided a\n$265 million construction loan\nfor the project. The building is jointly owned with Highwoods Properties, the North Carolina-based real estate investment trust that holds a 50 percent stake in 23Springs and Granite Park Six in Plano.\nOn the retail front, Australian-born restaurant Little Ruby\u2019s opened a freestanding restaurant at the project Feb. 2, joining \u00c9lephante and Torchy\u2019s Tacos.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If your car\u2019s warning lights start flashing, do you take it in for repairs or keep driving until the brakes fail?\nLeila Bozorg keeps driving.\nBozorg, Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s deputy mayor for housing, believes the state shouldn\u2019t amend 485x unless the crucial multifamily development law\nremains broken\nfor a while longer.\nHere\u2019s what\nThe City\nwrote last week:\nBozorg doesn\u2019t think the law needs any changes. \u201cIf you look at the history of 421a, there was slow uptake in early years and then it became a robust program that many used,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s too early to say that it has failed.\u201d\nPro-housing folks are optimistic about Bozorg. She just hired Andrew Fine from the YIMBY group Open New York as a senior adviser \u2014 one of several signs that she wants a lot more housing built. But her reasoning about the history of 421a needs a reality check.\nThe numbers simply don\u2019t tell the whole story of 421a, which preceded 485x as an essential tax break for developers to build mixed-income rental buildings in the city.\nThe last two times 421a expired, the state legislature made the new version less generous. So developers rushed to get their foundations in the ground before the expiration, then spent the next few years finishing the projects.\nOf course there was a pause before they embraced the new version.\nFirst, many developers didn\u2019t have the capacity to start a project with the new tax break while they still had holes in the ground under the old one.\nSecond, projects cannot compete on rents with simultaneous projects getting a more generous tax break. Projects that can\u2019t compete don\u2019t get built.\nFor the same reasons, 485x was destined to get off to a slow start, as Bozorg noted. Its terms are less generous than 421a\u2019s, and lots of 421a projects are under construction or soon to begin.\nBut the issues with 485x go beyond that. Its wage scale, which kicks in at 100 units and ramps up at 150, is\nshrinking\nprojects. That hasn\u2019t happened before. Developers\nwarned\nabout the\n99-unit problem\nas soon as 485x passed in 2024, and they have been proven right.\nProject filings show that developers are keeping projects\nunder 100 units\nto avoid the construction\nwage floor\nand the financial risks it presents.\nSome are splitting projects into two or three buildings, each with fewer than 100 units, but this is inefficient and raises costs \u2014 the opposite of what 485x is supposed to achieve.\nOther sites don\u2019t get developed at all because they can\u2019t accommodate two buildings and the economics don\u2019t work for a 99-unit project.\nLetting it fail for another two or three years is a bad idea. In a housing crisis rooted in a supply shortage, missing years of full production would be political malpractice. And there is no question that 485x is leaving thousands of units unbuilt.\nI don\u2019t mean to pin the blame on Bozorg. She works for Mamdani, who is aligned with construction unions just like his favorite villain Andrew Cuomo was. (As governor, Cuomo shut down 421a for 15 months at the behest of the unions before finally forcing them to make a deal.)\nBozorg believes developers will negotiate project-labor agreements with unions so they can do 485x projects without the high cost and risk of the wage floor. But that creates an obstacle for every 100-plus-unit project. Bozorg\u2019s job is to remove obstacles, not endorse them.\nThe city and state need to create a viable framework for developers to build as-of-right with as few bottlenecks as possible. Negotiating one PLA at a time is not the way to build our way out of the housing shortage.\nGary LaBarbera\nis the main reason lawmakers are hesitant to fix 485x. At one time, such projects didn\u2019t matter so much to the construction unions in his umbrella group, because they were busy enough building public infrastructure and Class A office towers. But things have changed.\nFirst, nonunion contractors learned how to build towers. And now infrastructure projects are stalling.\nDonald Trump \u2014 whom construction union members\nlargely voted for\n\u2014 is\nhalting infrastructure projects\nto get concessions from\nblue states\nor sanctuary cities, or because they are\nnot named after him\n. He also\nhates wind turbines\n.\nMeanwhile, not much office is going up.\nSo the unions want 100-plus-unit projects to themselves and will cling to the 485x wage scale even if it takes housing production down with it. State legislators and Gov. Kathy Hochul (all up for re-election) won\u2019t change the law this year, and Mamdani won\u2019t ask them to.\nHow many years will they wait?\n",

        "content": "Yay Yimby, nay bad landlords.\nOn Tuesday, back-to-back announcements delivered those two messages. The Mamdani administration released the dates for the five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, and then appeared at a rally to celebrate Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, to support her proposal to reform the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nDuring the press conference, Mamdani lamented the years that environmental review can tack onto a project\u2019s timeline.\n\u201cTwo years just to get through the environmental review on the project,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cAfter that, you don\u2019t even get to start building. That\u2019s just when the actual approval process can begin.\u201d\nHe went on to say that the governor\u2019s proposal \u2014\u00a0which would exempt certain housing projects of up to 500 units from environmental review \u2014\u00a0will allow the city to build more housing, which will drive down rents.\nWhile this was a welcome message for housing developers, property owners were reeling from another from the mayor.\nJust before this press conference, the mayor\nposted\na flyer on X that some have compared to a boxing match poster because of its declaration of the main attraction of the \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings: \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords!\u201d\nNew York Apartment Association\u2019s Kenny Burgos, who\ncomplimented\nthe mayor\u2019s comments about housing development, said the hearings will be \u201call show and no substance.\u201d\n\u201cI think we are all exhausted of elected officials that are more focused on splashy events instead of actually making people\u2019s lives better,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe dual announcements encapsulate the convergence of pro-housing development and pro-tenant policies.\nIn general, Yimby groups have increasingly\nincorporated\nmore pro-tenant policies into their legislative priorities. (Open New York supported 485x but also good cause eviction, for\u00a0instance, in 2024.)\nDoing so has perhaps helped make messaging around housing reform more palatable to those on the left. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen progressive New York electeds support ramping up housing construction as the solution to the city\u2019s shortage, embracing a pro-development message without coming across as pro-developer, per se. Tuesday\u2019s rally showed that the trend has reached new heights. A Democratic Socialist provided full-throated support for a proposal aimed at quashing a key weapon against housing development in New York: Lawsuits seeking to undo rezonings or nullify project approvals based on allegations that the accompanying environmental review was illegitimate.\nWednesday\u2019s rally also showed the growing influence of pro-development groups like Open New York. Executive Director Annemarie Gray, who was the only speaker aside from Mamdani and Hochul, said SEQRA has been weaponized by wealthy Nimbys.\nReal estate often gets lumped into one big-bad villain, sometimes taking down with it policies that would benefit the greater pro-housing movement. The fact that SEQRA has such momentum signals a shift in that thinking when it comes to housing development. For property managers and owners, the conversation isn\u2019t centered on making their jobs easier, but cracking down on bad actors in their midst.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Wednesday was \u201ctin cup\u201d day in Albany. During an hours-long back and forth with state lawmakers, Mayor Zohran Mamdani gave two anecdotes about speaking to a millionaire New Yorker and meeting with a real estate leader. In the first, he said he spoke to a millionaire who claimed he would leave NYC if his taxes were raised. Mamdani said that when he told this person that the tax hike he is seeking is 2 percent \u2014 $20,000 for someone earning $1 million a year \u2014 the high-earner acknowledged that he would not leave.\nMamdani also said he met with a real estate leader who told him that much of the value of his company hinges on the work of City Hall. Who was the mystery millionaire and real estate leader? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Jonathan Miller, an appraiser reporters have on speed dial, will\nno longer\nauthor reports for Douglas Elliman after 32 years. He announced Wednesday that he and the brokerage are parting ways.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026.\n\u2014\u00a0During a joint legislative budget hearing on Wednesday, Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, indicated that the administration is working on a bill to present to the state to reform the city\u2019s property tax system. Soliman said the proposal would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform, on which he served as executive director. One such recommendation would be to eliminate assessed value growth caps.\nLast year\n, Mayor Eric Adams similarly told lawmakers that the city was working on a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u2014\u00a0Mamdani also provided an updated estimate of the city\u2019s budget deficit for the next two years. It\u2019s $7 billion instead of the initially announced $12 billion. The mayor said the projection adjustment was made after taking into account Wall Street bonuses and income tax revenues. The change, however, did not change the mayor\u2019s mind about raising taxes on the city\u2019s wealthiest and on corporations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$24.8 million\nfor a 3,364-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$24.1 million\nfor a 30,000-square-foot, 30- unit apartment building at 335 Carroll Street in Carroll Gardens. Mack Real Estate sold the property to GDC Properties.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 2,156-square-foot, single-family house at 18 East 62nd Street in Lenox Hill. Abraham Sarway with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,085-square-foot, nine-story, 56-unit residential project at 11 Cornelia Street in Bushwick. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Shimon Greenfeld of SCG Capital.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The couple may be buying somewhere else on the island, but sources could not confirm where.\nThe Wall Street Journal broke news of\nthe purported contract\nfor 2 Indian Creek Island Road Monday evening. The purchase was said to be costing the Facebook founder between $150 million and $200 million and indicated that the longtime Palo Alto residents were ducking the Golden State ahead of its proposed 5 percent wealth tax.\nThe Cancros are not selling their home, according to broker Rena Kliot, who represented them in the purchase of the property in 2021.\nZuckerberg\u2019s possible purchase and relocation became the story of the week online and off. Many in the Miami real estate community touted it as proof of the Sunshine State\u2019s ascendancy and California\u2019s shortsighted policymaking.\nFlorida, and Miami in particular, has benefited from a significant wealth migration in recent years, including many tech billionaires. Jeff Bezos spent\n$234 million\non a trio of properties on Indian Creek Island, famously dubbed \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Bunker.\u201d There is speculation he bought a fourth 1.8 acre estate for\n$105 million\nin June.\nMore recently, Google co-founder Larry Page\ndropped $173 million\non a pair of waterfront Coconut Grove estates, and his co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly buying the Allison Island home of LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke.\nEven if Zuckerberg and Chan aren\u2019t buying 2 Indian Creek Road, they could be picking up another home on the private island, sources said.\nThere is only one Indian Creek estate currently on the Multiple Listing Service, cosmetic surgeon Dr. Aaron Rollins\u2019 spec mansion at 7 Indian Creek Island Road\nasking $200 million\n. Rollins\u2019 wife Marine Rollins, a real estate agent, did not respond to a request for comment about whether her home was the one that sold.\nBut many of the largest deals happen off-market.\n\u201cThere are several owners who have been quoting me these \u2018make-me-move\u2019 prices, ranging from $175 million on the lower end to upwards of $275 million,\u201d Joel Lusky of the Brokerage South Florida said.\nSources say football superstar Tom Brady\u2019s newly completed estate at 26 Indian Creek Island Road is quietly for sale in that price range.",

The 1.55-acre project site at 20955 Biscayne Boulevard is just south of the Broward County line, between\nAventura Mall\nand the Village at Gulfstream Park shopping center in Hallandale Beach.\nThe nine-story building will span 142,000 square feet, including 63,400 square feet of office. The rest is slated for retail, restaurant and fitness center uses. Jaxi Builders is the general contractor, and the development is already under construction.\nAventura paid $13 million for the property in 2020, acquiring it from a funeral service provider. The developer first submitted plans for the site in 2021, later revising them before moving forward.\nThe project adds new office and storefront space along a busy stretch of Biscayne Boulevard, in one of Northeast Miami-Dade\u2019s most active commercial corridors.\nThe retail vacancy rate in Miami-Dade County dropped to 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers. That plus a slowing development pipeline has created demand for investors.\nThe biggest retail sale in the fourth quarter was Aventura Mall owners Turnberry Associates and Simon Property Group\u2019s\n$131 million purchase\nof the former Esplanade Aventura shopping center, at 19505 Biscayne Boulevard, which has been rebranded the Abbey at Aventura.\nRetail development hit a post-pandemic peak in South Florida last year, when construction completions outpaced starts. About 765,500 square feet of retail space is under construction in the fourth quarter across Miami-Dade, according to Colliers.\nMeanwhile, Aventura has a low office vacancy rate compared to the rest of the country, at 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Savill\u2019s. Office space is less expensive in the suburb, at an average of $54.35 per square foot, compared to averages of over $110 per square foot in Miami Beach and almost $89 per square foot in Brickell.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Graham Companies pitched plans for a 541-unit apartment complex in Miami Lakes, in a proposal that hasn\u2019t received full-throated endorsement from locals.\nThe family firm, which developed Miami Lakes and is a major landlord in the town, wants to build the complex on a site previously slated for a \u201csenior village\u201d and an assisted living facility.\nThe 22.2-acre lakefront development site is at Oak Lane and Commerce Way in Miami Lakes. Graham owns the property, records show.\nThe Town of Miami Lakes Planning and Zoning Board deferred voting Tuesday on a requested future land use map amendment and rezoning necessary for the project. The board will take up the items on March 10.\nThe proposal marks the latest iteration for a project on the site. Graham worked on a plan in 2010 for a senior village with age-restricted apartments and an assisted living facility with skilled nursing. That project fizzled out when\nMiami Jewish Health\n, a nonprofit with health care facilities for the elderly in South Florida, backed out of the partnership in 2019. Another health care partner eventually also opted out of collaborating.\nThe firm previously discontinued construction of an office building on a portion of the site after the pandemic unraveled the market, partly due to remote work.\nGraham president Luis Martinez framed its recent proposal as Graham putting Miami Lakes\u2019 needs first, avoiding over-development. The project would consist of three-story buildings fronting Commerce Way, and four- and five-story buildings on the rest of the site. Graham would contribute $1.3 million toward a town senior center.\nAlthough the firm could use the Live Local Act, which allows for high densities and heights as a way to incentivize affordable housing, Graham has no experience operating below market rentals and pointed out the law allows for property tax abatements, he told the board. Under Live Local, all units designated for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income get a 100 percent tax break, and all units for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI get a 75 percent break.\nThis \u201ccan hurt\u201d a municipality that has to collect taxes to continue \u201cthriving,\u201d Martinez told the board. If density is maximized, it would allow for 978 units, he said.\n\u201cWe sincerely wish we had been able to create the senior village. Unfortunately, we just could not make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two paths available are Live Local or the applications in front of you today.\u201d\nSome residents still weren\u2019t persuaded by Martinez\u2019s presentation.\n\u201cEverybody is furious \u2026\u00a0 because they already are overwhelmed with the traffic in this town,\u201d said Bonnie Cintron, adding that the site previously was rezoned for the senior village under the promise that zoning would revert back to industrial if the project fizzled. \u201cMaybe it was a boldfaced lie. I don\u2019t know. It seems to be.\u201d\nGraham traces its roots to milk, bottling and distribution company Graham Dairy, started in 1932 by the late Ernest R. Graham. His descendants have expanded the firm into real estate, including the development of the 3,000-acre master-planned Miami Lakes, according to Graham Companies\u2019 website. Prominent family members include the late Phil Graham, who was publisher and co-owner of The Washington Post, and the late Bob Graham, a politician.\nThe company is now led by CEO Stuart S. Wyllie.\nGraham also plans a\n220-unit\napartment complex on a site near its recently proposed project. In 2024, it paid\n$69 million\nfor the ground lease for the 448-unit Courtyards at Miami Lakes at 6431 Cow Pen Road in Miami Lakes.\n",

        "content": "The famous Casa Encantada estate in Bel Air is back on the market for nearly $100 million below its initial listing price as it remains at the center of an ongoing legal dispute.\nCasa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road is now for sale for $170 million, down from $190 million last year, the New York Post\nreported\n. The property\nlisted in 2023 for $250 million\nafter first\ngoing up for sale in 2019 for $225 million\n.\nThe home belonged to late telecommunications billionaire Gary Winnick, who purchased the estate in 2000 for a record $94 million. Since his death in 2023,\nhis widow Karen Winnick\nhas been fighting to keep the home as lender CIM Real Estate Credit LLC looks to foreclose on the property. CIM originated a loan in 2020 secured against the estate, and the debt has increased beyond $150 million.\nA foreclosure auction was scheduled for December 2025 but the home has still not sold and remains on the market. \u201cAt Karen Winnick\u2019s request, the California Court of Appeal granted a temporary stay of the foreclosure on Dec. 16, 2025. That temporary stay continues to be in effect as of now,\u201d a lawyer for Winnick told the Post.\nWinnick and\nher son\nAlexander claim they were left \u201ceffectively destitute\u201d by an alleged loan-to-own scheme against the mansion and other assets. Karen was reportedly unaware of the terms of the loan.\nCIM\n\u2019s recent filings in Los Angeles Super Court call for moving the legal dispute out of California, claiming the fight should be in New York due to unspecified provisions in the 2020 loan agreement and a personal guarantee signed by Karen Winnick. The lender argues that she personally signed the guarantee and later executed multiple amendments and advance requests tied to the debt. CIM believes Winnick\u2019s connection to these documents disproves the idea that she was unaware of the debt structure.\nCasa Encantada\n\u2019s 28,725-square-foot main residence consists of seven bedrooms and 20 bathrooms. The estate has been home to billionaires in the past, including Conrad Hilton and David Murdock. The property also features a walnut-paneled library, hand-lacquered dining room walls, two formal salons and a bar for guests. Outside, rose gardens, orchards and rolling lawns surround the manse with a 60-foot tiled pool and a tennis pavilion.\nCourt hearings regarding the loan dispute are scheduled throughout the spring, including debates over whether the case should remain in Los Angeles and whether key claims can survive at all. A breach-of-contract lawsuit has also been initiated in New York.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Last year\u2019s priciest sale in Mar Vista topped out at roughly $6.8 million, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data and research by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe 2025 transaction was the off-market sale of 3594 Mountain View Avenue. The 4,748-square-foot house went for $1,422 per square foot in June.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment in the county, based on TRD Data for given periods. To see the top single-family home sales in Mar Vista last year click\nhere\n.\nTwo other homes on Mountain View Avenue made the top 10 list in Mar Vista.\nOne was 3516 Mountain View Avenue, a 5,000-square-foot house that sold in August for $6.6 million. That notched the No. 2 spot on the list. Compass\u2019\u00a0Ron Wynn\u00a0listed the property and\u00a0LA Real\u2019s James Maxwell worked on behalf of the buyer.\nThe other was the 4,506-square-foot 3598 Mountain View Avenue, which traded in September for $6 million, and secured the No. 6 spot on the list. Beverly and Company\u2019s Mojgan Zucker and Juliet Shoham sold the property and The Agency\u2019s Zach Goldsmith and Jennifer Plotkin represented the buyer.\n\u201cOur clients went into escrow when they had the plans and the developer built the house,\u201d Plotkin said. The seller was a developer under the entity 9027 Montemar LLC, she noted.\nThe three-story farmhouse-style house sits on a 9,591-square-foot lot. It has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and one half-bath, as well as a pool and two parking spots.\nDemand for homes in Mar Vista is being driven by families from Venice seeking more room and property owners impacted by the Palisades fire,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nA record was set in the district this month with the\n$10 million sale\nof a single-family home, as TRD previously reported. The record-setter was the sale of 11948 Modjeska Place on Feb. 3, a 6,100-square-foot house where the $10 million price came to $1,639 per square foot. The Modjeska Place deal was\nMar Vista\n\u2019s first residential deal ever to hit eight figures.\nCorrection: This story has been\nrecast to focus\non the top 2025 single-family sale in Mar Vista by sheer price.\n",

        "content": "Winnetka Park District officials are considering scrapping an agreement with billionaire Justin Ishbia for a $3 million donation for park improvements after an outcry from residents over design plans.\nThe\nWinnetka Park Board\n, a separate body from the village government, last week approved a scaled-back version of a plan to install fencing on Centennial Park beach for an off-leash dog beach. Residents and village zoning officials had questioned the initial fence plans.\nThe new proposal violates the terms of a $3 million donation agreement reached in 2024 with the Ishbia Family Foundation. Commissioners also voted to revisit that agreement and potentially terminate it once they receive permits for the new plan. Ishbia, a founding partner of Shore Capital Partners and co-owner of the Phoenix Suns, is building a megamansion on his property directly south of the park.\nThe controversy is the latest in a\nstring of feuds\nspurred by Ishbia\u2019s goals for his 68,000-square-foot mansion spanning three lakefront lots. Ishbia, whose wealth Forbes pegs at $5.8 billion, has been engaged in controversial back-and-forth with the village and residents over privacy barriers at his property and a proposed land swap that would have extended his property into part of Centennial Park.\nA spokesperson for Ishbia said he declined to comment. The Winnetka Park District did not return a request for comment.\nThe\n$3 million Ishiba donation\nis contingent on a number of improvements, including a fenced-off dog beach at the border between the park and his property, and a pier extending into the lake.\nResidents argued the initial fence plan, which called for fences extending into the water on the north and south ends of Centennial Park beach, was intended to secure privacy for Ishbia\u2019s home to the south by limiting navigation of the shoreline. The village\u2019s Plan Commission rejected the proposal in a Jan. 28 meeting, citing the barriers the fencing would present to residents traversing the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to understand that only one person benefits from a fenced-in dog beach directly north of the property,\u201d resident Peggy Martay told the Plan Commission at that meeting.\nCommenters also argued the plan violated the public trust doctrine, an Illinois legal principle that requires submerged land to be open to the public.\nPark officials have denied that the project is intended to enhance privacy for Ishbia.\nIn an email to\nThe Real Deal,\nWinnetka Park District Executive Director Shannon Nazzal said the new plan does not eliminate public access and is intended \u201cto safely define a designated off-leash area while maintaining lawful public access.\u201d\nDuring the meeting last Thursday, commissioner Christina Codo said the elements required by Ishbia\u2019s donation were good for the general public.\nThe elements include \u201cpublic access, which we should all want, the dog beach \u2026 the dog beach fence, which seems to be a necessary safety feature, the ADA access pathway, which seems to be really important for this community as we all age,\u201d Codo said.\nThe new proposal to install the fence on existing steel groins that extend out to the lake addresses the access concerns, said Director of Parks and Maintenance Costa Kutulas at the Thursday meeting. It also reduces the length of the dog beach from 490 feet to 265 feet and is designed to allow beachgoers to walk around the dog park entirely.\nThe design mounts the fence on the steel wall to use \u201can already existing barrier in the lake instead of creating new barriers by installing new fencing,\u201d Kutulas said.\nBut residents said during the Park Board\u2019s meeting last Thursday that the new proposal still limits the ability to walk along the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all designed to exclude people from that staircase,\u201d resident Ted Wynnychenko told the board, referring to a staircase on the breakwater at the edge of Ishbia\u2019s property. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we\u2019ve gone back to that.\u201d\nVillage commissions will review the new plans in upcoming meetings, and the Village Board of Trustees has the final decision over approving a special use permit for the project.\nThe fight over the dog beach is just the latest chapter, as Ishbia has pursued building his lakefront mansion since 2020, spending an estimated $77 million on land and construction.\nIn 2020, the park district\nagreed to a land swap\nthat would have traded a portion of Centennial Park for Ishbia\u2019s property at 261 Sheridan Road, which sits between Centennial Park and Elder Park. That proposal, which was intended to unite the two parks, spurred a lawsuit that ended in a settlement, with the park district agreeing not to hand over the land.\nIshbia also initially planned to build walls along the stone breakwater at the edge of his property, but the plan was scrapped after public criticism that the walls obstructed the view of the lake.\n",

        "content": "Two suburban Chicago apartment properties sold for a combined $80 million last week to separate buyers as the region\u2019s multifamily hot streak continues.\nTaken together, they underscore the rising confidence of buyers from both out of state and local shops as a depressed development pipeline gives landlords the ability to raise rents at close to nation-leading rates across the Chicago area.\nIn the larger of the two transactions, Summit, New Jersey-based Solomon Organization bought The Orion59 Apartments from Manhattan Beach, California-based Orion Residential for $43 million, public records show.\nThe sale of the sprawling 224-unit, multi-building complex built in 1971 came out to about $191,000 per unit, likely marking a win for Orion. The company led by Marc Venegas and Mark Limpert first bought the apartments in 2018 for $26 million.\nOrion originally bought the Naperville apartments at 30W041 Flamenco Court in a portfolio purchase of over 1,700 units across the Chicago suburbs from Dallas-based Lone Star Funds.\nIn November,\nMarquette Companies bought another apartment complex in the same Orion portfolio\n. Naperville-based Marquette bought the 198-unit Arlington Lakes Apartments for $46 million, which came out to just over $232,000 per unit.\nThe other two Chicagoland properties in Orion\u2019s portfolio haven\u2019t yet sold. They are Orion Parkview, a 512-unit property at 1821 W. Golf Road in Mount Prospect and Orion Prospect, a 783-unit complex at 475 W. Enterprise Drive in Mount Prospect. The portfolio was originally listed in 2022.\nMeanwhile, over in Westmont, developer Holladay Properties offloaded The Quincy Station Apartments in a $37 million sale to\nBanner Real Estate Group\n, according to public records.\nThough it\u2019s unclear how much the South Bend, Indiana-based developer poured into the development in total, the company took out a $22.5 million construction mortgage from Hinsdale Bank &amp; Trust to fund the project in 2020 and refinanced the property upon completion for $27 million with a mortgage from Old National Bank, records show.\nChicago-based Banner Real Estate Group bought the 94-unit Quincy Station apartments at 1 Quincy Street in Westmont for roughly $393,000 per unit but the presence of ground floor retail spaces skews per-unit cost estimates.\nThe two suburban apartment sales come as more than\n1,700 multifamily units in the Chicago suburbs\ntraded in the last few weeks.\nThose sales were:\nOsso Capital\u2019s $110 million sale of the 730-unit Woodland of Crest Hill Apartments in Crest Hill to Bayshore Capital Partners.\nMark Manda\u2019s\n$51 million sale of the 378-unit Wheeling property\nformerly known as VIP Apartments to FPA Multifamily, which rebranded the property to ReNew Lake Arlington.\nThe Hispanic Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $31.4 million sale of the 200-unit Arrowhead Apartments in Arlington Heights to Artisan Capital Group.\nAmeritus\u2019 sale of the 248-unit Fox Pointe Apartments in Aurora to Palatine Capital Partners for $40.1 million.\nlocal investor Daniel Kotcher\u2019s sale of 226-unit Carriage Creek Apartments in Richton Park to Bender Companies for $11.9 million.\nThough sales activity in the city of Chicago has been slower, developers still recently notched a win with a\nsale of 73 East Lake Street\n.\nM&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment, sold the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower in the Loop to a joint venture of Magellan and Intercontinental Real Estate for $126 million.\nThe sale was the biggest multifamily transaction in the Chicago region so far this year.\nThe area\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well because of a\nhistoric low supply of new units\nhitting the market and the region\u2019s strong fundamentals like its job market and room for rent growth. Some investors\nprefer the outer suburbs\n, however, due to their\nmore predictable property tax environments.\nThe issue has drawn attention to Cook County\u2019s Property Tax Assessor\u2019s race, which is heating up ahead of\na contentious Democratic Primary next month\n.\n",

        "content": "Home prices in San Francisco are on the rise as inventory remains low compared to other parts of the Bay Area.\nThe median\nhome price\nin the city reached $1.7 million last month, marking a 12.4 percent increase from the previous January, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing new data from Compass. The most expensive residential listing on the market as of early this month is a\nPresidio Heights estate\nat 3199 Jackson Avenue listed for $32 million. Condominiums are also seeing price increases across the city, with two-bedroom units reaching a median price of $1.3 million last month.\nLow housing inventory combined with increasing demand is fueling the increase in prices and ongoing\nhousing shortage, especially at the higher end of the market\n. As of the beginning of February, only 651 homes were on the market or soon to be listed, down 27 percent year-over-year and the lowest number in more than four years. The number of new listings also dropped 19 percent last month compared with a year prior. About 30 percent of the listings were single-family homes, 60 percent were condominiums, and about 10 percent were tenancy-in-common homes or co-ops.\nSo far this year, San Francisco has had so few houses available for sale that Napa County, with 16 percent of the city\u2019s population, has more homes on the market than San Francisco, according to Compass. The diminished inventory and rising demand for living space is expected to drive prices even higher this year.\nThe influx of tech and artificial intelligence workers into the city in recent years has\ncaused a shortage of mansions\nat the higher end of the market. Renters also face increasing headwinds as AI companies continue to grow in the city,\npushing up rent prices\nas tenants fight for limited supply across the city.\nBut not everyone points to the AI boom as the reason for an uptick in activity.\n\u201cWhile national home price appreciation is stuttering to a halt and many states and regions are seeing price declines, San Francisco\u2019s median home sales prices continue to surge higher, a dynamic we expect to see continue in 2026,\u201d Compass chief market analyst Patrick Carlisle said, naming the \u201cunderlying factors\u201d as \u201can extremely inadequate supply of homes for sale [versus] rapidly increasing demand due to the\n[artificial intelligence] startup boom\n.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The developers of Colony Ridge, a sprawling master-planned community north of Houston, will pay $68 million and temporarily stop expanding under a settlement with the federal government.\nThe agreement, filed Tuesday in federal court, resolves a\n2023 lawsuit\nby the U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleging the project\u2019s owners targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory, seller-financed mortgages, Houston Public Media\nreported\n.\nFederal investigators alleged Colony Ridge lured buyers with the promise of affordable homeownership, then steered them into high-risk loans without verifying their ability to repay. The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division also alleged the developers misrepresented flood risks and operated a bait-and-switch scheme that led to elevated foreclosure rates across the development.\nUnder the settlement, Colony Ridge is barred from developing\nnew residential plats\nfor three years. The developers must also invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and pay $20 million to boost law enforcement presence in the community. The agreement requires the company to implement borrower protections and create a plan to address credit harm tied to its lending practices.\n\u201cIntentionally targeting vulnerable borrowers with the American dream of homeownership and then trapping them in a predatory scheme is not only wrong, it also violates our civil rights laws,\u201d U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement.\nThe case became a political flashpoint in Texas well before the settlement. In 2023, Republican state leaders and conservative media outlets accused Colony Ridge of creating a haven for undocumented immigrants and fueling crime \u2014 claims the developers denied at the time. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, responding to the settlement Tuesday, said some of the law enforcement funding could support 287(g) agreements that allow local officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement.\nThe settlement throws a temporary wrench into the Houston-area\nhousing market\n, as well as one of the region\u2019s most prolific land development engines. Colony Ridge has added thousands of lots in\nLiberty County\nin recent years, marketing directly to working-class Hispanic buyers often shut out of traditional mortgage channels.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New year, same rental market.\nThat was the story for January rents in the city, where median rent for a brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,695, the third-highest number on record, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly rental report for Douglas Elliman.\nThe median rent was up 8 percent from last year, and down just slightly from December\u2019s numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in this mode of steadily rising rents and until we see more of a drop in mortgage rates,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller. \u201cI think that trend is going to be sustained for a while.\u201d\nThe luxury rental market continued to outpace the rest of the market in terms of price growth, somewhat mirroring the sales market in the city as wealthy renters or buyers continue to be able to afford higher and higher prices.\nMedian luxury rents \u2014 defined as rents in the top 10 percent of the market \u2014 rose over 14 percent annually to $11,500, continuing a trend that persisted through most of the back-half of last year. Brokers have\npreviously cited\na lack of high-end rentable inventory as one of the reasons rents have started to routinely push $100 or $200 per foot in that market.\nVacancy rate fell to 2.44 percent, well below the 10-year average in January, while inventory fell over 9 percent from last year. While some of the inventory disappearing may be a result of landlords pulling their listings off public markets after the passage of the FARE Act in June, the falling vacancy rate indicates that more than anything, \u201cthe market\u2019s still tight,\u201d said Miller.\nIn Brooklyn, median rent was $3,814, up 9 percent from a year ago, while new leases signed and leasing inventory were down significantly compared to last year.\nIn northwest Queens, including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City, median rent was up over 10 percent annually to $3,754 per month.\nMiller has been closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making on rate cuts, which can trickle down to lower mortgage rates. Lower mortgage rates mean more homebuyers and likely fewer renters. But after a surprisingly robust jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out on Wednesday, the odds of relief just grew slimmer, according to Miller.\n\u201cThe possibility of mortgage rates sliding seems more and more remote,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployment popped this month higher than expected, which makes it pretty hard to cut rates.\u201d\n",
