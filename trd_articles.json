        "content": "The debt tied to Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s portion of the New York Times Building is going the way of special servicing, but the fine print suggests not all is lost for the owner.\nThe $515 million commercial mortgage-backed securities mortgage went to special servicing ahead of next month\u2019s maturity, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The move was disclosed by Morningstar Credit on Monday.\nThe transfer request was made by Brookfield, which owns the upper half of the 52-story, 1.5 million-square-foot office tower at 620 Eighth Avenue. Floors 29 to 51 span approximately 740,000 square feet and secure the debt in question.\n\u201cWe are taking the first step in opening a structured, good-faith dialogue with our lenders to determine the best outcome for all stakeholders,\u201d a Brookfield spokesperson told the publication, adding that the exposure from the non-recourse loan is \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the company\u2019s real estate platform.\nIn February, Fitch Ratings\ndowngraded\nits outlook on Brookfield\u2019s portion of the Midtown West building to \u201cnegative.\u201d Brookfield took out a\n$635 million mortgage\nto refinance its part of the building in 2018 (the same year it acquired the portion), which was provided by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc. and Citi Real Estate Funding Inc.\nThere\u2019s also a $120 million junior mortgage and $115 million mezzanine loan in place, which Morningstar said further complicates the refinancing possibilities. The landlord has already extended its CMBS debt five times since 2020, according to Fitch, leaving no extensions left.\nBrookfield has seen an exodus of tenants in recent years, including law firms Goodwin Proctor, Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt and asset manager ClearBridge Investments (both those vacancies, however, were filled).\nIn September, law firm Covington &amp; Burling announced a plan to leave 200,000 square feet behind as it moves to Hudson Yards, leaving a large hole for Brookfield to fill, though the building is fully occupied at the moment.\nCash flow at the building hit $42.3 million last year, approximately 14 percent below the levels underwritten five years earlier.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Clad in his signature all-white suit and matching fedora, Alan Faena stood on the crimson stage \u2013\u2013 flanked by his development partners Edgardo Defortuna and Shahab Karmely \u2013\u2013 and said their planned Faena Residences towers won\u2019t merely offer condos.\n\u201cWe are offering happiness,\u201d Faena said at the Saturday night party for the official opening of the Faena Residences Miami Cultural Pavillion and Collaboratory, a sales center and cultural hub at 90 Southwest Third Street on the Miami River.\nThe center is adorned with mockups of Faena Residences and a room with a red velvet circular couch and red velvet curtains, reminiscent of the theater at the Faena District in Miami Beach.\nThe event celebrated the official opening of the cultural pavilion and collaboratory for Miami\u2019s high season. The sales gallery officially opened this spring and buyers started signing contracts in the summer, following an initial \u201cwhisper\u201d marketing campaign targeting friends and family, according to Defortuna.\nDefortuna\u2019s Brickell-based Fortune International Group and Karmely\u2019s New York-based KAR Properties are partnering with Faena on\nFaena Residences\n. The Miami River project will consist of a pair of 68-story towers with 440 condos, combined, connected by a roughly 50,000-square-foot bridge with amenities, Defortuna and Karmely said.\nCondos will range from one-bedroom to four-bedroom units, plus penthouses. Asking prices are $1.4 million to $4 million, with penthouses asking as much as $35 million.\nNearly 100 units have been presold so far for a combined $300 million, Defortuna said. The demand is nearly 60 percent foreign and 40 percent domestic, he added.\nThe Saturday celebration was held on the 1.8-acre riverfront vacant site at 24 Southwest Fourth Street, where the towers will rise. About 250 people attended the party, according to Defortuna.\nFaena Residences is the second Faena-branded project in Miami-Dade County, after the\nFaena District in Miami Beach\nthat includes condos, a hotel, bazaar, and an event and show venue. Faena also has projects in New York and Buenos Aires, with plans to expand to Tulum and the Middle East.\nThe goal is to bring the brand\u2019s style and cultural offerings to the Miami River, Faena told\nThe Real Deal\non Saturday after his speech on stage, describing the brand.\n\u201cFaena is Faena. Faena is a place like no other,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201ca place of fantasy, a place of entertainment, a place for fun.\u201d\nFaena Residences will be the first part of KAR and Fortune\u2019s three-phase project spanning over 5 acres in the Miami River District. Faena will be a partner in the future phases. The three lots are adjacent to the Wind, Ivy and Mint condo towers that were completed from 2008 to 2010.\nThe developers stayed mum about plans for the additional phases. Karmely cited interconnectivity among the phases, creating a shared space partly through the landscaping and a hub for education. Faena Residences\u2019 sky bridge will be home to a movie theater, event space underneath a cathedral-like dome, library, demonstration kitchen, recording studio and other features that create a \u201ccommunity,\u201d he said.\nFaena Residences is one of the last projects by the late architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Karmely said. Vi\u00f1oly died in 2023.\nConstruction is expected to start mid or late next year, Defortuna said. The towers are expected to be completed in 2029.\nMarried couple Raphaella and Christian Sigel, jewelers and real estate developers from Brazil, are among those who already reserved a unit. They said they are buying a two-bedroom vacation home for about $2 million.\n\u201cWe discovered Faena when we went to Buenos Aires, and we stayed in the Faena hotel,\u201d Christian Sigel said, adding that they looked at other branded condos in South Florida and settled on Faena.\nDr. Ash Beharrie, a kidney specialist who lives in Sunrise, is buying a 24th-floor condo for his family that they may use as a primary home in the future.\n\u201cThis is something I want to keep forever,\u201d said Beharri, who also looked at other branded projects in Miami. \u201cFaena is an amazing name.\u2026 It spares no expense.\u201d\nIn fact, waiting a few years until it\u2019s completed is not an issue, Beharrie added. \u201cThat\u2019s actually good. It gives me some time to pay for it,\u201d he joked, declining to disclose the unit\u2019s price.\nSanjeev Raman, a technology executive who lives at Elser Hotel &amp; Residences in downtown Miami, is buying an 18th-floor, two-bedroom condo with his wife, as an investment. They may use it as a primary home in the future. \u201cWe may end up living in Faena just because we like the brand and the lifestyle it\u2019s offering and the Rose membership,\u201d he said, referring to the Faena Rose exclusive membership club.\nGenerally, Miami\u2019s new condo buyer profile has shifted in recent years from primarily foreigners to more domestic buyers, as the city became a magnet for New Yorkers and other out-of-staters during the pandemic.\nNow, more New Yorkers are expected to head south due to\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s\nmayoral election win, Defortuna and Karmely said. Mamdani\u2019s calls for higher income and corporate taxes, his promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and views on Israel have stirred anxiety among some New Yorkers.\n\u201cI think inevitably we will get\u201d New York buyers, Karmely said, adding that some of his friends have recently called him to inquire about speaking with Faena Residences sales representatives. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want people to come here because they are escaping something. I want them to come here because this has become the city of the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s election also is prompting foreign buyers to question whether they should rush to make a presale to avoid a repeat of the pandemic, when condo prices skyrocketed amid high demand, Defortuna said.\n\u201cI think that the feeling is they [foreigners] better act now. The urgency is back into the market,\u201d he said, adding that he just came back from a trip to Argentina and Brazil. \u201cForeign buyers are used to buying preconstruction, paying in installments \u2026. It\u2019s a very natural process for them. But they feel if the New Yorkers come, prices are going to be increasing.\u201d\nFaena Residences is expected to be particularly popular among buyers from Argentina, the home country for both Defortuna and Faena, as well as Brazil and Mexico, among other countries, Defortuna said.\nThe Miami River project will add another branded condo to an already saturated market, as South Florida is the\nepicenter\nof branded condo development in North America, according to Knight Frank. Miami has 48 completed projects and 55 planned, trailing only Dubai, according to Savills.\nAmong planned projects are a\nRitz-Carlton in North Bay Village,\na\nWaldorf Astoria under construction in downtown Miami\nand a\nNobu in Brickell\n.\nBut the developers aren\u2019t fazed by competition. \u201cAny time is the right time,\u201d to launch Faena Residences, Karmely said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people selling burgers: McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s. They can keep selling. What we have here is such a completely different approach,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cThere is no other competition because frankly, you cannot pick another project that brings the combination of talent, location, execution, capability and design we have here.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The future of SL Green and RXR\u2019s Worldwide Plaza was uncertain. But a big name in New York City real estate appears to hold the key: Gary Barnett.\nThe Extell Development leader purchased the mezzanine debt backing the Midtown office building, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. It\u2019s unclear when Extell came into control of the debt \u2014 the company declined to comment to the publication \u2014 but it puts Barnett in prime position to take control of the building at its\nUCC foreclosure auction\n, scheduled for Jan. 15.\nThe previously undisclosed mezzanine lender scheduled a foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue. The entity that controls the building received a default notice last September from the owner of $190 million in mezzanine debt, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from New York REIT Liquidating (the LLC in charge of New York REIT\u2019s\nliquidation\n), which is also an owner of the property. Ownership is in default of both senior and mezzanine debt as of July, according to the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank originated $260 million in mezzanine debt. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by the two institutions, plus the mezzanine financing. Proceeds from the auction will go towards paying off the mezzanine debt and funding unpaid interest payments.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest tenant remaining \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The leftover 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, down\n80 percent\nfrom its $1.7 billion valuation in 2017, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to cause $500 million of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nSL Green and RXR acquired a roughly 49 percent stake in 2015; the since-liquidated New York REIT holds the majority.\nLast month, DBRS Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt. The special servicer is reportedly negotiating with the borrower regarding a loan modification, according to Morningstar.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A clash between the founders of the New York City-based brokerage\nCasa Blanca\nand its investors has landed in court.\nCEO Hannah Bomze sued two of its investors, Samuel Ben-Avraham and Christian Visdomini, in October over allegations that they\u2019re withholding $1.2 million in commissions owed to her, according to a motion for summary judgment filed in New York Supreme Court.\nNow those same investors are firing back with their own lawsuit accusing Bomze and her husband, chief operating officer Erez Zarur, of misappropriating the firm\u2019s funds to pay for personal expenses, such as luxury vacations.\nIn their complaint, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini accuse Bomze and Zarur of \u201cdishonest and disloyal acts,\u201d including refusing them access to the company\u2019s financials, investing more than $900,000 of the firm\u2019s money into cryptocurrency and generating \u201cphony documents to support [Bomze\u2019s] fabricated claims for commission.\u201d\nBomze denied the allegations, describing the lawsuit in a statement as retaliatory and \u201cfilled with slander and distractions.\u201d She added that she expects the judge to dismiss the case as it lacks merit.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent five years building Casa Blanca into one of the fastest-growing and most respected brokerages in New York,\u201d said Bomze in the statement. \u201cI will continue to protect the company I built and the work that made it successful.\u201d\nJim Kennedy, an attorney for Ben-Avraham and Visdomini, billed the investors\u2019 case as \u201cstraightforward,\u201d adding, \u201cwe have faith in the court\u2019s ability to resolve it.\u201d\nCourt documents reveal that what began as a legal action to collect unpaid commissions has since morphed into a messy falling out between Casa Blanca\u2019s leadership and financial backers.\n\u201cCasa Blanca is not only at a crossroads, but also at a stalemate,\u201d the investors state in their complaint. \u201cThrough their deliberate and knowing misconduct, Hannah and Erez are preventing Sam and Chris from protecting their interests \u2014 and those of our investors \u2014 in the Company.\u201d\nInside the dispute\nBomze and Zarur launched Casa Blanca in 2019, backed by a $1.8 million investment from Ben-Avraham, also an early investor in WeWork and Ronnie Fieg\u2019s streetwear brand, Kith. The firm, which marketed itself as the \u201cTinder of real estate\u201d with its app-focused approach, now has\nroughly 200 agents\n.\nIn the lawsuit, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini allege Bomze and Zarur didn\u2019t contribute any capital to start the brokerage, and that they together own 43 percent of the company, while Ben-Avraham owns 41 percent. (Visdomini owns just under 3 percent, while the rest is controlled by other investors.)\nBomze claims in her motion that between 2021 and 2025, she earned roughly $2.5 million in commissions\nfrom transactions\nwhere she personally represented the buyer or seller, though so far, she\u2019d only received about $1.3 million. She alleges that under the terms of an independent broker agreement, she\u2019s allowed to keep all of the fees associated with those deals.\nHowever, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini pushed back on those claims, arguing that Bomze\u2019s compensation agreement, which consists of a salary and 0.5 percent of the company\u2019s commissions, doesn\u2019t include a provision about personal deals.\nThe investors further allege that Bomze created fake documents to support her claims, and that even if the broker agreement existed before her request for commission payment, it was never shown to the board. The investors claim Bomze should have to pay back the commissions she\u2019s already received.\n\u201cThe Company could not operate if one officer received 100 percent of commissions on her own deals, and no investor would have agreed to fund the venture on that basis,\u201d the complaint states. The board \u201chas never discussed or approved any addendum or side agreement providing a personal commission entitlement to any Manager.\u201d\nBut Bomze dismissed the investors\u2019 claims, instead arguing that since she \u201cpersonally procured and closed those transactions,\u201d she\u2019s entitled to the commissions.\n\u201cUnder New York law, these commissions belong to me,\u201d Bomze said in the statement. \u201cI intentionally postponed collecting them and left the money in the company for years to support the business, strengthen cash flow, and fuel its growth.\u201d\nIn addition to the commission dispute, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini also accused Bomze and Zarur of \u201cpaying hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses with the Company\u2019s credit cards.\u201d\nAmong the expenses were \u201chigh-end restaurant charges, luxury vacations, charges related to the Bomzes\u2019 children\u2019s summer camp, gifts given to individuals unrelated to the Company or its business, and memberships to private tennis clubs, restaurants, and nightclubs in New York City.\u201d The complaint also stated that Zarur used $900,000 of the firm\u2019s funds to buy Bitcoin.\nLouis Buckworth, who\npreviously worked with Casa Blanca\n, allegedly reported his concerns about the alleged misappropriation of funds to Ben-Avraham in July, after he and his wife met Bomze and Zarur for drinks at Le Bilboquet in the Hamptons following the couple\u2019s dinner at the restaurant.\nBuckworth told Ben-Avraham that Bomze and Zarur paid for their entire one-on-one dinner with the corporate credit card even though it was a \u201cpurely social (and very expensive) dinner,\u201d according to the complaint.\nBen-Avraham and Visdomini filed their lawsuit after negotiations with Bomze to withdraw her earlier action broke down, according to the complaint, which seeks damages related to what they describe as \u201cegregious acts of betrayal.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also requesting the judge order Bomze and Zarur to provide them access to all of the company\u2019s financials, including \u201cbanking statements, related software platforms, passwords and logins necessary to access the Company\u2019s financial information.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also seeking declaratory judgment stating that Bomze is not owed any of the $1.2 million in alleged outstanding commissions and that she has no right to keep the $1.3 million she\u2019s already been paid.\n",

        "content": "The age-old question of whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich is giving way to an even more important debate in the Flatiron District: is a coffee shop a restaurant?\nThose are the grounds through which residents of 140 Fifth Avenue are suing to stop the pending arrival of Ralph\u2019s Coffee, the New York Post\nreported\n. The namesake coffee chain of Ralph Lauren is seeking to relocate from 160 Fifth Avenue.\nRestaurants are barred from taking the retail space on the building\u2019s ground floor, a commercial condominium owned by Ascot Properties NYC.\nResidents had a bad experience with a Russian restaurant years ago, when Nasha Rasha\u2019s presence led to \u201cdisastrous results\u201d according to an affidavit from the co-op board president, who complained of odors, noise, trash and vermin, all of which were \u201ctotally unbearable\u201d to the residents above.\nBut Ascot\u2019s lawyer claimed in court documents that Ralph\u2019s is not a restaurant, but an eating and drinking establishment, which the attorney claims sidesteps the issue.\nA lawyer for the residents disagrees.\n\u201cA restaurant is defined in Merriam Webster as a business establishment where meals or refreshments may be purchased,\u201d read the complaint from the residents.\nResidents are wary of what they see two blocks north at the Ralph\u2019s location in operation. The complaint references \u201cmobs of people on the sidewalk, loud noise and garbage.\u201d But the lawyer for Ascot objected to the complainants\u2019 concerns and instead suggested that if there are problems with the business after it opens, they \u201ccan seek injunctive relief then.\u201d\nShould Ralph\u2019s sign on the dotted line, the shop plans to renovate the 739-square-foot retail space, moving around walls and adding finishes, fixtures and a ramp. Buildout would take eight to nine months and Ascot would benefit to the tune of $20,000 a month in rent; it acquired the unit in 2016 for $6.4 million.\nThere are 19 residences at 140 Fifth Avenue, which doesn\u2019t see a frequent amount of turnover. The most recent sale took place more than a year ago when a two-bedroom unit traded for $2.4 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Riviera Beach City Council unanimously voted to forge a deal with a team led by Sonnenblick Development that will include the construction of a new city hall and library, sports complexes, and residential units on about 72 acres of publicly owned land.\nThe 5 to 0 vote took place during Riviera Beach City Council\u2019s Monday meeting. Should negotiations fail with Pacific Palisades, California-based Sonnenblick, the city would then arrange a deal with its competitor, Peter Bayatarian\u2019s North Palm Beach-based Forest Development.\nSonnenblick Development\u2019s partners include Clearwater-based Sports Facilities Companies, Washington, D.C.-based Gragg Cardona Souadi, and West Palm Beach-based RDG Development Group.\nBoth Sonnenblick Development, led by Robert Sonnenblick, and Forest Development answered an invitation-to-negotiate that centers on redeveloping 40.8 acres of city-owned land at 600 and 601 West Blue Heron Boulevard where Riviera Beach\u2019s current city hall now stands; 29 acres of vacant Palm Beach County School District-owned land near Inlet Grove Community High School; and 2 acres of city-owned land at 2215 Broadway, according to a summary presented by the city\u2019s consultant, PFM Group Consulting.\nSonnenblick\u2019s $480.6 proposal, which will be designed by Omaha-based architecture firm Leo A. Daly, received a slightly higher score from the city\u2019s selection committee than Forest Development\u2019s phased $635 million redevelopment plan.\nSonnenblick\u2019s concept includes a $100 million city hall, a $59.5 million sports complex with indoor and outdoor facilities, and a pair of $237 million mixed-use residential developments that would target teachers and first responders as residents.\nSonnenblick\u2019s proposal has two options for a new city hall. The firm could build a new 150,000-square-foot city hall with a 600-space parking garage somewhere within the ITN area, or it can build a 150,000-square-foot city hall and library complex with 1,000 spaces on what is now the water tank at C Street within Marina Village, a waterfront area at 200 East 13th Street that the city of Riviera Beach\nis also intent on redeveloping\n.\nSonnenblick\u2019s athletic facility proposal, spearheaded by Sports Facilities Companies, includes an indoor sports facility with four basketball and eight volleyball courts, 10,000 square feet of meeting space and a 16,000-square-foot fitness center, as well as an outdoor complex with four fields, eight tennis/pickleball courts, four outdoor basketball courts and other features.\nFor housing, Sonnenblick proposed building The Flats at Blue Heron, a 488-unit project by West Blue Heron Boulevard that will include a rail transit station and a broadband telecommunications network, and the 170-unit The Commons at Broadway and West 23rd Street.\nRiviera Beach issued an invitation to negotiate in 2024 as a means of replacing the city\u2019s crumbling 1970s-era city hall and attracting more investment in the city.\nSince then, a slew of projects have been proposed in Riviera Beach with\nabout 2,000 apartments and condos in the pipeline.\nAmong the new projects are Forest Development\u2019s\nOculina\n, a pair of 25-story condo towers at 3700 Broadway that will be built next door to the nearly completed\nNautilus 220\nproject that Forest and Daniel Kodski\u2019s Royal Palm Companies are developing in neighboring Lake Park.\nLast week, Forest Development also beat four other contenders for the right to negotiate the purchase of a 2.2-acre parcel from Riviera Beach\u2019s Community Redevelopment Agency for a future\n$325 million project near the waterfront\nat 1851 Broadway.\nSonnenblick emphasized his track record of building public facilities all over the country.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t build $400 million condo projects. What we do is build government tenanted buildings like city halls, federal government offices, state and county buildings, things like that,\u201d Sonnenblick told council members.\nSports Facilities Companies, meanwhile, has built and programmed sports and recreational facilities all over the country. While Gragg Cardona Souadi has built affordable housing and mixed-income projects in the Washington, D.C. metro area.\nSonnenblick has also made a bid to construct a\nMargaritaville Hotel in Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village",

The buyer borrowed a $102.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase.\nThe purchase price breaks down to $409,700 per apartment.\nRelated, led by the P\u00e9rez family, and Rockpoint, led by Bill Walton and Keith Gelb, completed development of the building last year. They had paid $3.2 million for the 3.8-acre development site in 2021, records show.\nThe building, which Pantzer renamed The Point at Miramar, offers studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom units. Monthly rents range from $1,489 to $4,835, according to Apartments.com.\nPantzer, led by Jason and Jordan Pantzer, closed its $1 billion Panco Strategic Real Estate Fund VI last month, according to a company news release According to an affidavit Jordan Pantzer signed and filed in Broward County, Panco Fund VI Holdings is the sole member of the purchasing entity that bought the Miramar apartments.\nPantzer has been a frequent investor in South Florida apartments. Last year, it paid\n$83.5 million\nfor the 245-unit The Point at Palm Beach Grove complex at 7130 Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach. Also last year, Pantzer bought the 352-unit The Point at Lakeside complex at 11481 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\n$139.2 million.\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have experienced an uptick in recent months, despite higher interest rates, slower in-migration by out-of-staters and other headwinds. Many of the buyers are relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, as Pantzer did for its Miramar purchase, or are turning to insurance companies for loans.\nThis month, West Shore paid\n$117.9 million\nfor the 542-unit Palm Beach Gardens Apartments complex at 4120 Union Square Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens. Last month, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n.\n",

The former home of the Christian media company spans 70,800 square feet, and the sale price works out to $7.4 million per acre.\nNewport Beach-based Meritage secured approvals from the\nCity of Costa Mesa\nin August to build 142 homes at the site.\nThe seller was Manny Khoshbin, whose Irvine-based Khoshbin Company bought the site in 2021 for $22 million and marketed it as an event venue. CBRE\u2019s Anthony DeLorenzo, Greg Sullivan, Sammy Cemo and Bryan Johnson represented the seller.\nThe plan calls for detached two-story single-family homes and four-story stacked flats. Two-bedroom, two-bathroom units will span 1,000 square feet, while four-bedroom, three-bathroom homes will span 2,400 square feet.\nThe development is expected to take about two years.\nTrinity built its former Bear Street headquarters in 1976. The site has been in flux since the broadcaster vacated it in 2017, leaving behind\nfilm studios\n, a theater and parking facilities that sparked multiple reinvention and redevelopment attempts.\nEducation First Properties floated an international language school before the pandemic scuttled the plan.\nAfter Khoshbin Company bought the property in 2021, the firm reimagined the grounds as \u201cThe Palazzo by Khoshbin,\u201d leaning into the property\u2019s European-inspired design in opening an event venue.\nMeritage Homes has been active in the area.

        "content": "As Chicago\u2019s suburbs reel in multifamily investors, outer-ring communities that were once overlooked are gaining momentum.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage\nInterra Realty\nfound, and a few counties stood out in the competitive field.\nOut of the metro area\u2019s total multifamily sales, the share of sales that took place in Kendall County was up 300 percent, and a whopping 550 percent in Will County, compared to the same time period last year, according to new analysis from Interra.\n\u201cAs renters migrate to these areas in search of space and affordability, investors are following suit to capture that steady demand,\u201d said Patrick Kennelly, Interra\u2019s managing partner for suburban multifamily.\nUntil recently the multifamily market in these western and southwest suburbs had been outshined by areas closer to downtown Chicago like DuPage and Lake counties.\nChicago\u2019s steady job market and measured supply has made it a strong base for multifamily investors. The\nMidwest\nas a whole has surged to the top of rent growth charts, bringing in a wave of institutional buyers this year betting that limited development pipelines in the region will let landlords keep pushing rents. Meanwhile, markets like Denver and others are slowing price hikes as a glut of new supply comes online.\nIn the Chicago area, Interra recorded 155 apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million during the first three quarters of 2025 compared to 115 in all of 2024. Cook County still dominated, despite its chaotic property tax conditions, with 94 deals made so far this year.\nBut interest is spreading to farther flung communities.\nIn the first three quarters, there were 24 transactions in DuPage County, 11 each in Lake and Will counties, seven in Kane County and four each in Kendall and McHenry counties.\nThe boost in Will and Kendall counties is particularly notable as rents continue to jump in the urban core and its surrounding suburbs.\nWill County\u2019s largest transaction last quarter was the sale of the\nLincoln Station Apartments\n. After a decade-long construction quest and an ensuing legal dispute, rescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments gave developer Richard Gammonley the green light to sell his newly built complex in New Lenox. Miami-based\nJSB Capital\nbought the 220-unit property from Gammonley and 7 Acre for $65 million.\nThere\u2019s also been a growing crop of major developments stretching west into Kendall County, where two multifamily sales of more than $80 million took place this year.\nIn June, the Emblem Apartments in Oswego were sold by their developer, homebuilding giant Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm Quarterra, for $84 million to an affiliate of a J.P. Morgan real estate investment trust, public records show. That was followed with an Oct. 1 purchase by\nNew York-based DRA Advisors\nof the 368-unit Aurora at Summerfield Apartments within Kendall County for $88 million.\n",

The money would cover a shared-use path, new street lighting and upgraded crosswalks and signals at Algonquin and Linneman roads, according to village documents.\nAnother $2 million would go to the\nMount Prospect Park\nDistrict for recreational upgrades, anchored by a new splash pad at the RecPlex. The contribution gives the village a visible, near-term community benefit as it greenlights a project designed to churn out substantial tax revenues for decades.\nThe agreement follows trustees\u2019 approval last month of revisions to Cloud HQ\u2019s site plan. What was once a three-building campus approved in 2022 has been reworked into two larger structures. The shift streamlines construction and maintains the project\u2019s revenue potential, village staff say.\nOnce both buildings are running, officials estimate the campus will generate more than $7 million a year in electricity tax revenue alone \u2014 a lucrative line item for municipalities courting data center operators.\nThe\ndata center\nis also expected to be a major engine for\nMount Prospect\u2019s\ntax increment financing district, with staff projecting more than $100 million in future TIF revenue. That pool would give the village ample room to fund infrastructure upgrades and redevelopment efforts in its long-overlooked southern corridor.\nCloud HQ aims to deliver its first building in 2027, with the second slated for late 2030. Construction would reactivate a site that has sat largely dormant since United decamped, a point Mayor Paul Hoefert leaned on in voicing support for the deal at a board meeting last month. He called the project\u2019s long-term financial impact \u201chuge\u201d and said it could help the village avoid raising property taxes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Sutter Health\nis planning to open another hospital in the Bay Area in the coming years, this one in the heart of Silicon Valley.\nThe Sacramento-based health care provider is planning to build an eight-story, 850,000-square-foot medical facility at 2831 and 2841 Mission College Boulevard in Santa Clara, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The development near Levi\u2019s Stadium will replace an office complex.\nThe plans call for 272 beds, an emergency department, intensive care unit, labor and delivery department and other services for patients. The hospital is projected to open in 2031, and some of the buildings on the campus will open in 2027.\nThe hospital is one part of Sutter Health\u2019s larger multi-site expansion in\nSanta Clara\n. The proposed medical center will be one component of Sutter West Santa Clara Campus, a five-building, 700,000-square-foot campus that will also offer care units for cancer, orthopedic and sports medicine, women\u2019s health, heart and vascular health.\nSutter Health already has a presence in Santa Clara. Last month, the health care system opened the nearby Sutter East Santa Clara Campus at 2441 Mission College Boulevard. That complex spans about 300,000 square feet and includes primary care, speciality care, ambulatory surgery and urgent care.\nSutter Health\u2019s East and West Santa Clara campuses\ncost an estimated $2.8 billion.\nSutter Health, which owns more than 20 hospitals in Northern California, has been expanding in the Bay Area this year.\nIt bought a 12-acre life sciences campus in Emeryville for $450 million in February. The health care firm\nbought the two-building, 530,000-square-foot campus\nand a handful of vacant lots at 53rd and Horton Streets. It plans to redevelop them into a 1.3 million-square-foot hospital and medical center as part of its $1 billion Sutter Emeryville Campus expansion in the East Bay.\nThe purchase from Blackstone\u2019s BioMed Realty worked out to $615 per square foot. The firm has made seven real estate purchases to assemble the forthcoming Sutter Emeryville Campus. The medical center there is expected to begin serving patients in 2028, with the hospital opening in 2032 or 2033.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Creation is pairing up with PGIM Real Estate to turn trash into treasure.\nThe joint venture started construction on a 600,000-square-foot logistics hub, according to a news release. The project, 635 Exchange, is rising on a 36-acre plot that used to be a City of Dallas landfill. It\u2019s expected to be delivered next fall.\nDallas-based developer Creation and PGIM, the asset management arm of Prudential Financial, landed a $65.5 million construction loan for the project in recent months, D Magazine\nreported\n. JLL Capital Markets arranged the financing.\nThe three-building hub will be at the nexus of Interstates 35 and 635 in northwest Dallas. The old landfill was at 11535 Newberry Street. The location offers easy access to DFW International Airport.\nAt the groundbreaking celebration, Creation made a $25,000 donation to vocational school CLC Inc.\u2019s YouthBuild project, which provides education and job training to at-risk youth.\nPGIM\u2019s Soultana Reigle expects the timing of the project to allow it to \u201cbenefit from structural tailwinds in supply-chain optimization and e-commerce demand.\u201d\nThough its vacancy rate ticked up in the third quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s industrial market is strong. The region logged its 60th consecutive quarter of positive industrial space absorption, according to CBRE.\nLess than 3 percent of third-quarter deliveries were pre-leased, which caused the vacancy rate to rise 20 basis points in the third quarter to 9 percent. But that figure is expected to drop again, since the percentage of pre-leased products in the pipeline increased from 18.4 to 40 percent by the end of the third quarter.\nManufacturing drove most of the quarter\u2019s leasing demand. The most in-demand industrial submarkets in the region are South Dallas and Northwest Fort Worth, which is home to AllianceTexas, Hillwood\u2019s 27,000-acre mixed-use development and logistics hub.",

        "content": "Development buzz is growing on the Greenpoint waterfront.\nThe Jay Group has secured a $320 million construction loan for a 590-unit rental project at 97 West Street in Brooklyn. G4 Capital Partners provided the financing. Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital brokered the transaction.\nIt\u2019s the third deal between The Jay Group and G4, according to the lender\u2019s co-managing partner Jason Behfarin. \u201cIt demonstrates our commitment to our experienced and capable sponsors,\u201d he said.\nThe neighborhood, at the northern tip of Brooklyn, has seen a spate of high-density residential development. The area was rezoned in 2005, allowing for residential construction in an area once dedicated to industrial activity.\nThe rental project at No. 97 is one of several planned developments along West Street. Down the street,\nTF Cornerstone is planning a 1,000-unit project\nat No. 45. And about 10 blocks north at Greenpoint Landing, Domain Companies, LMXD and Park Tower have proposed 1,000 units, 20,000 square feet of retail and a public park. About 300 units are set to be affordable.\nThe Jay Group has been active on the Greenpoint waterfront, with help from G4 Capital. The developer bought 101 Fleet Place in 2021 for $42.8 million, with a $130 million construction loan from G4, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. A 21-story residential tower is complete at the site.\nG4 also provided a $55 million loan to The Jay Group last year to buy six lots in the same area, 102-110 Fleet Place, 165 Willoughby and 275 Flatbush Extension, for $75 million, according to the Observer.\nThose lots were purchased from entities connected to Jack Guttman of Pearl Realty, who is currently connected to the most recent site, according to public records.\nIt\u2019s unclear if a sale has closed on the property; neither Guttman nor the Jay Group immediately responded to a request for comment. The ownership entity purchased the site for $7 million in 2001, when Jack\u2019s father Joshua Guttman was running the business.\nThe Guttmans were also behind the sale of No. 45 to TF Cornerstone for\n$175 million\n.\nJoshua Guttman\u2019s name gained notoriety in the 2000s after a multiple-day fire at the Greenpoint Warehouse Terminal, which he owned. Guttman weathered\nmedia suspicion\nthat he was connected to the blaze, as well as other fires at his properties. But another man, a homeless Polish immigrant named\nLeszek Kuczera\n, was charged with accidentally starting the fire when harvesting copper wire.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if the Jay Group is targeting a tax abatement for the development. The city\u2019s current program,\n485x\n, makes building large-scale projects like a 590-unit development more difficult than previous tax abatement programs. In Greenpoint, developers need to pay their construction workers nearly $75 per hour for projects exceeding 150 units to be able to nab the abatement. That increases costs by about 29 percent over previous tax programs, according to calculations from the Real Estate Board of New York.\nG4 has elsewhere provided Rabsky Group with\n$320 million\nin construction financing for a Tribeca condo project and\n$286 million\nfor a Gowanus multifamily development.\n",

        "content": "My colleague Kathryn Brenzel wrote an\nintriguing article\nabout the Meatpacking District RFP, in which the city sought an \u201cemerging developer\u201d but did not choose one.\nInstead, the Economic Development Corporation selected a bid by Douglaston Development \u2014 a very experienced firm \u2014 and \u201cemerging developer\u201d David Himmel, a former COO at the big real estate company Jamestown and scion of a prominent real estate family.\nAlicia Glen, the former deputy mayor, said as a feminist she found the decision \u201cappalling and disgraceful.\u201d\nGlen is absolutely right that this was a missed opportunity for the city to help a female developer. But it\u2019s worth mentioning that the city had another priority: to create as much affordable housing as possible. For that, it tapped a proposal from an experienced team with ample access to capital.\nThe city and state often have various goals for their projects \u2014 low rent, community benefits, MWBE firms, union labor and more. Some are at odds with each other, and it\u2019s impossible to fulfill them all while also choosing a viable bid. The Meatpacking RFP for the former Gansevoort Meat Market site was a classic example.\nOne real estate professional told me soon after the RFP was issued that it looked like a challenging project, because of the affordability required and other factors, even though the city was offering a free 99-year lease for the land.\nThe winning bid will set aside up to 55 percent of the apartments as affordable and use no subsidy beyond the standard 485x, which requires high wages for construction workers. And it comes from Jeff Levine\u2019s Douglaston, which has 40 years of experience, and the well-credentialed Himmel.\nNothing in development is guaranteed, but Douglaston and Himmel are more likely to be able to raise the necessary capital and bring the project to fruition than a less experienced, less connected builder, and probably offer more affordability, too.\nHimmel obviously doesn\u2019t look like an emerging developer. And it\u2019s not great optics that EDC president and CEO Andrew Kimball also worked at Jamestown. But the families who win housing lotteries for the affordable units are not going to care.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhere will Andrew Kimball go when Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor? Whom will Mamdani pick to run the Economic Development Corporation? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Under a\nlaw\njust signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, landlords can no longer make a profit on a bounced-check fee passed on to a tenant. There is one exception: A landlord can still charge at least $20, even if the bank fee is less than that amount.\nElsewhere\u2026\nLast week, we were thinking about how Blackstone could be taking a heavy loss on a $1.8 billion portfolio of senior housing, an asset class experiencing a \u201cstrong rebound,\u201d according to Baker Tilly, and the population is aging.\nA reader responded by pointing out three factors that can make senior housing complicated to operate:\nIt has a lot of move-outs (including deaths)\nIn recessions or other times when it\u2019s hard for seniors to sell their homes, fewer can afford to move into senior housing\nPeople are staying in their homes longer than they used to, in part because of property tax discounts, and thus moving into senior housing later, which means shorter stays\nOne thing I know from experience is that even if moving into senior housing (or a doorman building) makes perfect sense, many older people will remain in houses and communities not conducive to aging in place. But that has always been true.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$13 million\nfor a four-bedroom co-op at 1050 Fifth Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Anne Z Easton with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $160 million for\n346 Madison Avenue\nand\n11 East 44th Street\nnear Grand Central Terminal. Claudio Del Vecchio sold the two properties to SL Green.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12.25 million\nfor a 3,161-square-foot condominium unit at The Westbury, 15 East 69th Street in Lenox Hill. Anthony Pike of Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 37,360-square-foot, 12-story, 48-unit residential project at 2790 Creston Avenue in Fordham. Anthony Ng filed the permit on behalf of Long G Lin.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

It sits directly across from 601W\u2019s flagship redevelopment of the\nOld Post Office\nand a block away from transit hub Union Station \u2014 a key selling point in a sluggish office leasing environment.\n601W has a track record of taking on large, distressed or underperforming buildings and repositioning them, often with an eye toward modern amenities or conversions.\nDetails on 601W\u2019s plans for the West Loop building weren\u2019t disclosed, but the firm had explored repositioning the nearby former Northern Trust office building just to the south at\n801 South Canal Street\nas an upgraded office building. But the landlord later backed away from those plans and is toying with converting it\ninto a data center asset\n.\nThe submarket in the southwest portion of the Loop and just over the river to the southern portion of the West Loop has struggled with vacancy, but the Van Buren Street building\u2019s proximity to 601W\u2019s existing holdings may offer cost and operational synergies.\n601W is also in talks to buy the severely distressed\n175 West Jackson Boulevard\njust to the east, after landlord Brookfield defaulted on a massive loan tied to the property amid the depths of the pandemic.\nSheridan, meanwhile, is positioning itself as a go-to bridge lender in a market still plagued by high interest rates and valuation resets. Its bet on 601W signals confidence not just in the borrower\u2019s execution but in the long-term viability of well-located office assets, even those with leasing challenges.\nThe transaction comes amid a wave of distressed office sales in Chicago, as institutional owners look to cut losses or exit troubled assets. For 601W, the Van Buren pickup is a discounted play next to one of its crown jewels \u2014 and now, another shot at a turnaround.\n",

I just haven\u2019t announced,\u201d when\nasked\nif she plans to run on the WFLD program \u201cChicago Live.\u201d\n\u201cThe city needs a gray-haired grandmother who\u2019s got the cajones to get everybody in shape, get everybody in the room, say, \u2018this is the pie; you can only have a piece of it,\u2019\u2019 Pappas said.\nPappas, who has held post as the\ncounty\u2019s treasurer\nsince 1998, joins an early but growing list of candidates who have either declared or hinted they are considering a challenge to Johnson.\nDuring her tenure, Pappas has had a key role in the distribution of\nproperty tax revenue\nfor many decades, and has been in the middle of several attempts and pushes to reform or overhaul the property tax system.\nBeginning in 2022 Pappas\u2019 office\nperformed studies\nthat have pointed out inequities within property taxing systems in hopes of statewide reform. Pappas\u2019 office published two reports that found that Illinois property tax law was negatively affecting\nhomeowners\nwho got behind on their tax bills.\nThe law allowed tax buyers to avoid paying based on\ntypos\nor other small errors regarding how the property is described on government websites, and Pappas\u2019 office sent legislation to Springfield to remedy the situation in 2023.\nEarlier this summer, a federal judge just gave hundreds of homeowners the green light to\nsue Cook County\nover tax lien sales, granting class-action status to a lawsuit filed in 2022 by former homeowners and housing groups alleging the county\u2019s embattled tax sale process\nstrips property owners of their equity\n, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, allowing the case to move forward on behalf of as many as 1,700 Cook County homeowners.\nThe\nlawsuit\nalleges that Cook County\u2019s tax sale process violates the U.S. Constitution by stripping property owners of their equity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County.\nPappas\nargued the county was simply following state law and that any pocketed excess value was going to those private tax buyers, and Illinois is the only state affected by the Tyler ruling that\nhasn\u2019t changed its laws\n. Around the same time Pappas postponed this year\u2019s tax sale to 2026 in hopes lawmakers would act.\nAnd a\ntax study\nfrom her office this month warned taxpayers that their incoming delayed bills will once again show increases, partly due to a sharp decline in Loop commercial property values.\n",

The city banned the development of new purpose-built self-storage facilities in 2006 after the city eliminated storage as a permitted use in most districts.\nDECA got its foot in the door by finding a zoning technicality in San Francisco\u2019s southern industrial area, which includes the Produce Market district.\nIt secured entitlements for the project through this loophole. San Francisco\nremoved\nthe city\u2019s Industrial Protection Zone designation for the area three years ago, closing off any future development opportunities. As such, DECA\u2019s project will be the last self-storage development in the city for the foreseeable future.\nThe San Francisco metro has a limited supply of self-storage space, relatively speaking. There are about 24.1 million square feet of rentable space across 405 facilities in the region. That works out to about 2.8 square feet per person of rentable space. Nearly half of San Francisco\u2019s 4.7 million residents are renters.\nThe\nself-storage sector has added 547 million square feet\nover the past decade across the country.\nThe growth is largely concentrated in cities high in multifamily construction, and specifically in regions where the share of residents living in apartments grew while home ownership decreased.\nAs San Francisco sees an\ninflux of renters in the ongoing artificial intelligence boom\n, the city must wrestle with its anti-development sentiments among residents and officials while working to meet its\nstate-mandated goal\nof 82,069 new housing units by 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Graham Development\u2019s high-profile plan to remake a stretch of\nSouth Congress\nAvenue may hinge on an old East Austin landfill that Travis County is aiming to seize.\nCounty commissioners voted this week to use eminent domain to acquire the 150-acre site at 9500 East Highway 290, a move that could derail Graham\u2019s mixed-use project nearly 15 miles away, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe landfill is the lynchpin because Graham needs it to house a scrapyard \u2014\nLKQ Auto Salvage\n\u2014 that sits on its development site, at 7900 South Congress.\nThe scrapyard holds a lease through 2036, making redevelopment impossible unless it moves. Graham Development and the landowner, Moo Moo Meadows, sued Travis County in July, alleging the county illegally blocked the scrapyard\u2019s relocation while failing to address long-standing contamination at the landfill.\nCounty officials say the East Austin tract is needed for landfill maintenance, repair and potential parkland, though no cost estimate was disclosed. A spokesperson declined to elaborate on why the acquisition is necessary. An unsigned resolution in the meeting packet shows the parties failed to agree on voluntary acquisition terms.\nIf the county takes the site,\nGraham Development\npartner Corbin Graham said he will lose his only viable landing spot for LKQ. He told the outlet that scrapyards require ultra-low-cost land \u2014 under $4 per square foot \u2014 which simply doesn\u2019t exist along\nSouth Congress\nor Highway 290.\nA closed landfill fits the bill, in his view, because the use relies mostly on storing cars on compacted gravel rather than building structures that would demand costly engineering on unstable ground.\nEnvironmental issues at the landfill are well documented.\nThe site stopped accepting waste in 1982, and tests earlier this year found unsafe levels of arsenic, barium and lead in leachate and groundwater, according to the lawsuit. Graham and Moo Moo Meadows argue the county ignored years of directives from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to close and remediate the site and overstepped its authority in blocking the scrapyard move.\nGraham\u2019s proposed\nSouth Congress\ndevelopment is substantial: 1,218 apartments, 210,000 square feet of office space, 136,000 square feet of retail and an affordable housing component.\nTo salvage it, he\u2019s pitching a tax increment reinvestment zone that could generate roughly $20 million toward cleanup, alongside $10 million the county has budgeted. But until the eminent-domain fight is resolved, the future of one of South Austin\u2019s biggest potential redevelopments remains stuck behind a scrapyard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Deed records show the deal closed in late August. The three-story building covers 1.24 acres just outside downtown and a few blocks from the\nStockyards\n.\nCHC has already kicked off a round of improvements, targeting restrooms, common areas and exterior lighting, as well as a new conference and break room. Ground-floor space is being marketed for retail and restaurants.

His firm owns the Vinnedge Building a block away, which is about 95 percent leased, and he\u2019s aiming for a similar outcome at the Mercado.\nMaguire said demand for Northside office space is surging, drawing global tenants and luring companies out of downtown.\nThe\nNorth Main corridor\nis also getting attention through Main Street America, a $650,000 pilot program backed by the\nFort Worth\nLocal Development Corporation aimed at revitalizing underserved areas.\nLocal developers are plotting new uses for empty buildings nearby, while the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Urban Land Institute have been studying tools to curb displacement in the predominantly Hispanic Historic Northside.\nBlueAlpha and CHC say they\u2019re working with the Hispanic Chamber as they lease the building, framing the project as an effort to elevate the corridor without pushing out legacy businesses. The Northside sees an estimated 300,000 visitors annually and has a 3.7 percent retail vacancy rate, but no meaningful construction in more than a decade.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The team is also working on securing Fannie Mae approval, which would make it easier for first-time buyers to purchase with conventional financing.\nThe monthly maintenance dues will be between 80 cents to 85 cents per square foot, or about $500 a month for the smallest units.\nGamla Cedron Group also owns the lot next door to Centralis Residences, but the developer has not yet decided whether it will build apartments or condos, Azar said.\nA\nhandful of developers\nin recent years have converted new or recently completed apartment buildings into condos because demand for for-sale units outweighed demand for rentals. Hollywood developer Chip Abele and\nPMG\nare among them. Last year, Invesca Development Group secured\na $55.2 million loan\nfor an apartment-to-condo conversion of a 214-unit complex in Pompano Beach.\nOther developers such as Alta Development and Raimundo Onetto from Alta Developers both launched sales of condo projects that they initially designed as apartment buildings.\n",

        "content": "Michael Comras is planning a major renovation of a Lincoln Road portfolio his namesake firm acquired for $140 million.\nComras declined to confirm the purchase price, which was provided to\nThe Real Deal\nby a source familiar with the transaction.\nMiami Beach-based\nComras Company\nbought 11 storefronts at 600, 719\u2013737, 741, 801\u2013821 Lincoln Road and 723 North Lincoln Lane, a press release states. The firm financed the purchase with a $117 million loan from San Francisco-based Acore Capital.\nThe seller, New York-based Morgan Stanley, acquired the assemblage in 2014 as part of a larger portfolio deal valued at\n$342 million\n, records show. At the time, Morgan Stanley bought the properties from Coral Gables-based Terranova, which retained a stake.\nCurrent tenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery.\nComras\nplans to transform the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road, the release states. The district will entail Via NoLi, an 18-foot-wide paseo carved through the 700 block of\nLincoln Road\n, connecting to North Lincoln Lane. Via NoLi will be lined with boutique storefronts and culinary destinations.\nThe project will also have NoLi Plaza, which will consist of caf\u00e9 seating, a central fountain and greenery, and North Lincoln Lane will be transformed from a service alley into a pedestrian walkway featuring storefronts, expanded sidewalks with cafes and outdoor seating, the release states. Retail spaces will range from about 400 square feet to 4,000 square feet.\nThe portfolio was set to be sold to another buyer. Duane Reade drugstore\u2019s Cohen family was under contract to buy the buildings for more than $150 million, but the deal fell apart when the Cohens were unable to land an equity partner or secure a loan, published reports state.\nFounded in 1992, Comras also has a leasing brokerage division and owns other properties on Lincoln Road, including 635-639, 701 and 734-744 Lincoln Road, according to the company\u2019s website. Comras\u2019 Lincoln Road tenants include Aldo, Swarovski and Hoka.\nIn 2015, Comras sold the block at 1001-1035 Lincoln Road to Pontegadea, the family office of Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, for\n$370 million\n.\nLincoln Road\nhas gone through a downturn in recent years as the outdoor pedestrian shopping street has lost national tenants to newer competing retail and dining destinations such as the Miami Design District and Wynwood. Many storefronts are currently vacant, and the Regal South Beach movie theater is shuttered. But landlords and brokers say Lincoln Road is averaging an occupancy rate of 77 percent, and a new influx of tenants are building out some of the empty spaces.",

        "content": "The would-be developers of affordable housing at the Elizabeth Street Garden are suing the city, claiming that the mayor illegally dedicated the site as a city park.\nPennrose, Habitat NYC and Riseboro, who were tapped in 2017 to build 123 senior housing units on the city-owned site, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday alleging that Mayor Eric Adams illegally designated the site as a city park.\nThe complaint accuses Adams of unilaterally deciding the site\u2019s future use without going through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park.\n\u201cNothing in State or local law, the City Charter, or otherwise empowers the mayor or mayoral agencies to dedicate City-owned land as parkland,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe complaint names Adams, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the city Department of Parks &amp; Recreation and First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro as defendants.\nThe lawsuit cites reports of a Nov. 6 letter to Parks Commissioner Iris Rodriguez-Rosa from DCAS Commissioner Louis Molia, announcing that the \u201ccity unequivocally and permanently dedicates this property to public use as parkland.\u201d\nThe move came after the Adams administration\nreversed\nits position on the project, known as Haven Green, announcing that it would not evict the longstanding sculpture garden from the site. Instead, the administration cut a deal with local Council member Chris Marte, who agreed to support the rezoning of three other sites that would net 620 affordable units, more than 400 apartments than were planned for the garden site.\nThe reversal drew criticism from City Council leaders, housing advocates, developers and other elected officials. The decision came after years of\nlitigation\n, in which the city eventually\nsecured\nits ability to evict the nonprofit that leases the Nolita garden.\nIn the lawsuit, the development team points out that the administration abandoned a \u201cshovel-ready\u201d project for ones that are far from certain. It also questions the relationship between Mastro and attorney Norman Siegel, who had represented the nonprofit, and Adams\u2019 former chief of staff, Frank Carone, who has supported opponents of Haven Green. The administration\u2019s reversal came after Mastro was made first deputy mayor in March and announced he was \u201creviewing the project.\u201d\nAhead of the November election, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nindicated\nthat he would move forward with Haven Green and evict the garden. After the Adams administration declared the land a park, Mamdani told reporters that pursuing the project would be \u201c\nnearly impossible\n.\u201d Using city parkland for other uses would require action by the state legislature.\nThe lawsuit argues that allowing the mayor to declare the site parkland outside the legal process will have far-reaching implications.\n\u201cIf allowed to stand, Respondents\u2019 actions would establish dangerous precedents: that the Mayor, or any mayoral agency, could unilaterally overturn a completed ULURP by executive fiat; that a land-use decision duly vetted, debated, and approved by the City Council may be silently reversed without public process; and that the rule of law governing New York City\u2019s land-use system can be disregarded and displaced by political convenience and preference,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThat is not what the City Charter mandates, and it is not how a lawful government functions.\u201d\nRepresentatives for the mayor did not immediately return requests seeking comment.\n",

This is bullshit,\u201d Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez said during the\nAd Hoc Committee for LA Recovery\nspecial meeting on Monday. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re still here. It feels like we\u2019re circling the drain, and I don\u2019t know who\u2019s calling the shots from the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d\nRodriguez, who is a member of the ad hoc committee, was responding to a request made to her and her peers to approve moving $8 million from the city budget to the Bureau of Engineering. That money would be used to pay for work\nAECOM\non current rebuilding efforts and map out the long-term recovery.\nThe requested $8 million won\u2019t be\u00a0 paid to AECOM immediately. Rather, the allocation, which was ultimately approved with stipulations, will make the money available for the Bureau of Engineering to pay the firm as work is delivered.\nWith little to show since AECOM\u2019s contract was announced in June, Rodriguez voiced frustration over the money request.\n\u201cWhy are we continuing to play with all these other things [related to the long-term] when all it\u2019s doing is delaying the implementation of an actual plan to get shovels into the ground immediately?\u201d Rodriguez asked.\nTraci Park, who chairs the ad hoc committee, expressed concern about whether there was a less costly option, considering \u201cI can\u2019t even find funding for the Department of Building and Safety to hire an outside contractor to clear the toxic debris and rubble out of the Palisades Bowl.\u201d\nThe Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates community on Pacific Coast Highway remains uncleared, preventing tenants from returning and also creating what Park called a \u201ctoxic soup.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Rodriguez did not respond to a request for comment on the councilmember\u2019s statements.\nThe mayor\u2019s office responded to the critiques generally instead of directly addressing Rodriguez or Park.\n\u201cWhile some in the city criticize without providing solutions, Mayor Bass remains focused on leading the fastest disaster recovery effort in modern California history and on getting families home \u2014 full stop,\u201d a spokesperson from the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement provided to\nThe Real Deal\non Tuesday. \u201cMayor Bass recognizes that recovering from a disaster of this magnitude requires working with all levels of government, philanthropic partners and experts in the private sector to get families home. She will continue to do that.\u201d\nApproved with contingencies\nThe contract with AECOM, which has headquarters in Dallas and an office in Downtown Los Angeles, was a follow-on move to a work solicitation first released by the city in January. That solicitation ultimately led to AECOM being tapped in May for work that included overarching management of the recovery plan, infrastructure restoration and fire protection planning and logistics and traffic management.\nThe total cost of that work was $5 million and due in 120 days. Additional work on longer-term planning was then added by Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 office, tacking on another $3 million.\nAECOM began work earlier this year meeting with residents and city departments, in addition to working on three plans that are viewed as key to supporting the massive construction zone that\u2019s expected in the Palisades in the coming years. Those three outlines address infrastructure restoration, fire protection and logistics and operations.\nThe three reports have not been presented to the ad hoc recovery committee, prompting the three members present at Monday\u2019s meeting to approve paying AECOM an amount not to exceed $5 million for the work that\u2019s been done. Any additional payments are subject to review and approval by the committee, once they see the three reports within the next month.\n\u201cBotched\u201d job\nRodriguez\u2019s comments come as the one-year anniversary of the\nPalisades and Eaton fires\nlooms, with much of the public communication on the recovery being spearheaded by Bass\u2019 office.\nHow decisions are being made within the mayor\u2019s office was\u00a0 a key question asked Monday, given several key decisions being made without full council approval.\nIn July, Rodriguez confirmed to\nTRD\nshe had learned of the contracts with Hagerty and AECOM at the same time as the public, when Bass\u2019 office issued press releases.\n\u201cThe challenge I have \u2014 and this is not about AECOM \u2014 it\u2019s just procedurally how things are being authorized is we\u2019re being forced to be pot committed,\u201d Rodriguez said during Monday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThat is, you\u2019ve gone ahead, and you started doing all of this [community] engagement and work and now they come to us and say, \u2018Oh, by the way, you\u2019re not going to get the final product until you approve an $8 million transfer\u2019\u2026. That\u2019s just not how business should be done.\u201d\nRodriguez said Bass\u2019 office \u201ctotally botched the first few months of this recovery.\u201d\nTo date, the mayor has tapped developer Steve Soboroff in January to serve as chief recovery officer. Well publicized disputes related to pay and Soboroff\u2019s scope of authority led to the severing of ties after 90 days in the position. That was followed up with the mayor\u2019s office announcing in February a contract struck with Illinois-based disaster recovery firm\nHagerty Consulting\nfor what a spokesperson in the mayor\u2019s office described earlier this year as \u201cplanning, response, recovery, financial management and operations.\u201d\nThe Hagerty contract was not to exceed $10 million, according to the contract. The deal was criticized from the time it was announced for the lack of transparency around the approval process as some wondered about the qualifications of an out-of-state firm.\nA late October report from the City Administrative Officer confirmed similarities in the work of Hagerty and AECOM, indicating the \u201cphasing out of Hagerty\u2019s support\u201d last month.\n",

        "content": "Shamrock Trading is giving the Loop something it hasn\u2019t seen much of lately: a growing tenant adding to the downtown workforce.\nThe Kansas-based transportation services firm locked in a downtown office lease, bucking a market still defined by shrinkage, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The company leased 24,800 square feet on the 10th floor of 151 North Franklin Street, a 35-story tower that the\nJohn Buck Company\nand\nMorgan Stanley\ndeveloped in 2018.\nShamrock is subleasing the floor from\nCNA Financial\nand plans to open next month, adding a second local outpost as it gears up for a major Chicago-area hiring spree. It already has an office in west suburban Lombard. Colliers brokers Tom Volini and Sven Sykes represented Shamrock in the deal.\nShamrock was drawn to the tower\u2019s modern amenities, transit access and the fact that CNA\u2019s old space was move-in ready. The sublease runs through CNA\u2019s existing term, which marketing materials show stretches to May 2035.\nShamrock, which operates a collection of logistics, finance and tech-related businesses serving shippers, is chasing the same recruiting edge that\u2019s brought other suburban companies downtown.\nThe dual-office setup is meant to help the firm court recent grads who want an urban address, while still appealing to experienced professionals eyeing suburban commutes, the company\u2019s Vice President of Real Estate Matt Huderski told the outlet. The Chicago office will be Shamrock\u2019s 11th nationwide.\nShamrock plans to hire 100 people downtown and 30 more in Lombard by the end of next year, doubling its Chicago-area headcount.\nThat growth puts Shamrock in line with a broader surge of logistics-related companies bulking up Chicago offices since 2020.\nArrive Logistics\n, MoLo Solutions, Loadsmart, Spot Logistics and Total Quality Logistics have all expanded in the city, reinforcing Chicago\u2019s long-running status as a freight and supply-chain hub.\nThe move lands squarely against the prevailing tide of companies cutting space or abandoning the city\u2019s core. Downtown vacancy is near record highs as hybrid work thins demand.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The eight-bedroom estate was built last year by\ndeveloper Joe Farrell\n.\nThe 1.24-acre property initially asked just under $80 million when it hit the market in April 2024. Farrell slashed the asking price by $10 million last October.\nGrousbeck\u2019s new abode spans 8,600 square feet and has eight bathrooms and a 4,400-square-foot rooftop terrace with a putting green. The grounds also feature a pool, a six-car garage and 125 feet of oceanfront.\nCompass\u2019 Richard Steinberg and Hedgerow Exclusive Properties\u2019 Greg Gould and Dominic Couzens represented Grousbeck in the deal.\nThe home is near another of Farrell\u2019s developments, a sprawling waterfront property at 155 Surfside Drive, which hit the market for a\nwhopping $125 million\nin 2023. The estate is no longer being offered for sale, though it has hit the market for rent several times, asking $1 million for about a month-long stay.\nFarrell, CEO of the eponymous development firm, announced last week that he bought an oceanfront home at 42 Deforest Road in Montauk for $17 million, a record-high price for the neighborhood of Ditch Plains Beach,\nBehind the Hedges\nreported. The one-acre property last asked just under $20 million.\nGrousbeck\u2019s purchase in Bridgehampton comes roughly three months after he sold his controlling interest in the Celtics to a group led by private equity executive William Chisholm for $6.1 billion. Grousbeck, who bought the team in 2002 for $360 million, ceded his seat as governor of the team as part of the deal, though he is remaining on board until Chisholm takes over the rest of the company in 2028.\nAmong the investors\nin Chisholm\u2019s group is Bruce Beal, Jr., the president of Related Companies. Beal is also the vice chair and partner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team, which the development firm\u2019s chairman, Stephen Ross, owns.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019 Executive Directive 1\nhas made all-affordable housing the most competitive development play in the city.\nDevelopers are increasingly opting to build 100 percent affordable apartments as a way of getting projects through the approval pipeline faster, as entitlement timelines shrink from about a year for market-rate projects to 60 days for fully affordable endeavors, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nSince the city rolled out ED1 in late 2022, developers have filed plans for about 42,300 income-restricted units, with roughly 31,700, or 75 percent approved so far. That\u2019s more than double the city\u2019s affordable approvals in the three years before ED1. The directive allows applicants to bypass public hearings and council votes for projects restricted to tenants earning no more than 80 percent of\narea median income\n; in Los Angeles County, that\u2019s $84,850 for one person.\n\u201cEfforts like ED1 show that there\u2019s plenty of appetite to build nonluxury apartments by market-rate developers,\u201d said Jason Ward, co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. \u201cYou just have to create the circumstances to do that.\u201d\nLast year, five developers from across the country joined forces to create Passo, a Los Angeles-based entity designed to take advantage of ED1. So far, the venture has finished one project totaling 15 units, and it has more than 600 more units in construction and planning phases. Passo shaved months off the entitlement timeline and tens of thousands of dollars in fees by tapping ED1.\n\u201cED1 is the only reason we came out here,\u201d Passo principal Daniel Glimcher said. \u201cMarket-rate multifamily just really doesn\u2019t pencil out in L.A.\u201d\nStill, developers face hurdles in getting their projects across the finish line \u2014 namely, when it comes to paying for them. Higher interest rates and slower lending, combined with the city\u2019s Housing Authority\u2019s recent cut to\nSection 8\nsubsidies, present challenges in advancing fully affordable projects. The controversial Measure ULA transfer tax is also repelling some investors.\nAt the same time, Mayor Karen Bass has imposed new limits, such as removing single-family areas from ED1 eligibility and tightening\nincentives\nand fee waivers. Some developers who jumped in early are now trying to flip their entitled sites rather than build, SoLa Impact CEO Martin Muoto told the outlet.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak,\ntold\nCoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nCalifornia has been working to cut red tape to build affordable housing in an effort to stamp out chronic housing shortages.\nOver the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom\nrolled back provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act\n, which frequently bogged down developments in the review process. The City of Los Angeles must\npermit\n456,643 new homes by 2029, though even with the boost in building thanks to ED1, the city remains far off from that goal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Whitestone\nadded another Houston shopping center to its cart, picking up the fully leased Ashford Village in west Houston as competition tightens for well-located retail.\nThe Houston-based Real Estate Investment Trust \u2014 which also owns Blvd Place in the Galleria area \u2014 closed on the 81,400-square-foot property Oct. 31, marking its 10th commercial holding in the region, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe sellers were Spencer Hough, Tommy Le of 3 Real Estate Group, and George Giannukos. JLL\u2019s investment sales team, led by John Indelli and Ryan West, represented the sellers, with analytical support from Dawson Hastings and Max Myers.\nAnchored by Seiwa Market, an 11,000-square-foot Japanese grocer, Ashford Village sits at 1801 South Dairy Ashford Road and is 100 percent leased. Other tenants include Dollar Tree, Book Off, Goldfish Swim School, Giggles and Fun and Salon Village. Seven of the center\u2019s 15 tenants cater to Asian consumers, a demographic that has surged 23.6 percent in the surrounding area since 2010, JLL noted.\nThat population trend is central to\nWhitestone\u2019s\nthesis. The Memorial\u2013Briar Forest pocket just north of Bellaire\u2019s Asiatown has been drawing upwardly mobile households seeking more space without straying far from established cultural hubs. Tim Ng, Whitestone\u2019s VP of acquisitions, told the Chronicle that Asian families often migrate outward from Asiatown as incomes rise, with Memorial emerging as a preferred destination.\nThe 1979-built center, last renovated in 2014, also checks broader location boxes. It\u2019s near major employment hubs in the Westchase District and\nEnergy Corridor\nand fronts a busy stretch of Dairy Ashford that sees roughly 32,500 vehicles a day.\nHouston\u2019s chronic westward population growth and the tight supply of new retail \u2014 constrained by construction costs and high occupancy \u2014 have made stabilized centers like Ashford Village increasingly competitive. JLL said the property drew multiple offers even before formally hitting the market.\nThe deal lands amid a flurry of Houston\nretail trades\n. On the same day Whitestone closed, Baker Katz snapped up the 108,000-square-foot Lakewood Forest Shopping Center, its biggest buy in three years.

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-11-19T19:30:00",
        "content": "Developers on Tuesday laid out the \u201ccontours of a plan\u201d for seven remaining sites at Pacific Park in Brooklyn, describing a development that would add thousands of housing units to what was previously approved.\nDuring a public workshop, executives from Cirrus Real Estate Partners and LCOR, the project\u2019s new development team, pitched a plan that would result in taller, but fewer towers, and ultimately net 9,000 housing units for the megadevelopment (including those already built). The previous plan called for a total of 6,430 units.\nIf this version is pursued, the development would include five towers, instead of six, on sites that will require a platform to be built over active train tracks between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue. Density from the eliminated tower, dubbed B8 and located at the corner of Carlton and Atlantic avenues, would be shifted to the other sites. Meanwhile, B8 would become green space.\nThe total development, formerly called Atlantic Yards and first proposed over two decades ago, would result in 9.6 million square feet, compared to the previously planned 8 million. The average height of the project\u2019s buildings would be 550 feet, instead of 350 feet.\nThe proposals are not final, and any changes will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of a project. That will be a separate process from the public workshops.\nIt remains to be seen how community members and elected officials, long critical of how the project has been carried out, will feel about the final framework as it takes shape.\nA taller, more feasible vision\n\u201cWe\u2019re here tonight to present a feasible plan, not the final plan,\u201d said LCOR\u2019s Anthony Tortora.\nThe changes, according to the developers, would speed up construction of housing, while also ensuring that more open space is part of the plan.\nCirrus\u2019 Joseph McDonnell explained that shifting residential density from B8, which presented logistical challenges, would lead to faster housing construction. Most of that square footage would be moved to solid ground, rather than atop a platform. In other words, to areas where it is easier to build.\n\u201cThis is a very constrained site. We\u2019re not here to sugarcoat it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to take what we\u2019ve been given, and it\u2019s imperfect, it\u2019s an imperfect plan from a very imperfect development, and try to achieve more affordability and more open space.\u201d\nThe development team, he said, is guided by wanting to build \u201cmore affordable housing sooner,\u201d to add more contiguous open space and to ensure the affordable housing is available to a range of income levels. Given those concepts, he said it may make sense not to build on B8.\n\u201cI think what separates us is the thought around restraint,\u201d he said,\nThe team also proposed shifting development rights from a public plaza in front of Barclays \u2014\u00a0once envisioned as a Frank Gehry-designed office tower called \u201cMiss Brooklyn\u201d \u2014\u00a0to build two towers on what is known as\nsite 5\n, across the street from Barclays and currently home to a\u00a0 P.C. Richard &amp; Son and a former Modell\u2019s that was recently\nconverted\ninto a youth basketball training facility. Tuesday\u2019s workshop was held at the latter.\nThe towers on site 5 would rise a maximum of 775 feet, higher than the previously approved 620 feet, though even taller towers were previously\ncontemplated\n. The developers are thinking of focusing the income levels of the affordable units on moderate- to middle-income tenants, with rents capped at levels affordable to those earning at most 130 percent of the area median income. The previously approved rents were affordable to those earning between 40 percent and 160 percent of the AMI.\nDecades of delays\nEven the presentation of a rough draft of a new plan for Pacific Park represents a step forward for the long-delayed project. The project was first\nannounced\nin 2003, and in the two decades since, it has faced various legal and economic challenges, in addition to the individual financial troubles of the developers who have come and gone from the project.\nNine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed as part of the project, with more than 3,200 apartments built, by original developers Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nA joint venture led by Cirrus and LCOR\ntook over\nthe remaining seven sites (eight when including the plaza\u2019s development rights) through a foreclosure auction last month, after Greenland USA defaulted on nearly $350 million in loans tied to the properties. Greenland, as well as the U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress, are also part of the joint venture, but won\u2019t have an active role in managing the development\nEmpire State Development, the state agency overseeing the project, held the workshop on Tuesday to solicit general feedback from the community about what they would like to see accomplished by the project. This was the first of four workshops planned, and the first time the development team publicly provided information about their visions for the sites.\nAt one table during the workshop, attendees said they wanted to see \u201ctruly affordable housing,\u201d more oversight of the project and, ultimately, they wanted the project to be completed.\nThe workshop got off to a bumpy start when the venue\u2019s microphone broke and ESD tried to move forward with the presentation without one. That didn\u2019t go over well with some attendees who declared that they couldn\u2019t hear the first speaker.\nAfter a brief delay, ESD procured a replacement microphone from P.C. Richards next door.\nSome elected officials attended the workshop, including Assembly member Jo Anne Simon, Council member Shahana Hanif and Sen. Jabari Brisport. Several attendees were also wearing shirts with union logos, including from the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. Construction union pension funds will help finance Pacific Park, as part of a deal Cirrus reached with the city and the Building and Construction Trades Council last year.\nHanif, whose district includes site 5, said she viewed the workshop as a \u201cfresh start.\u201d She noted her concern with penalties that Greenland was supposed to pay for failing to meet a May 2025 deadline.\nUnder a 2014 agreement, the developer was required to finish the project\u2019s 2,250 affordable apartments (at this point, 876 are left) by the end of May, or pay $2,000 per unfinished unit for every month that the apartments went without a temporary certificate of occupancy.\nBut when Greenland failed to meet the deadline, ESD declined to enforce the penalties, citing concerns that the developer would sue and further delay the project. Instead, the new development team will pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund, which will be paid in installments. The state has emphasized, however, that it retains the right to collect penalties if future benchmarks are not met.\n\u201cThey sort of got away with it,\u201d Hanif said of the fines, while acknowledging that she understood the state\u2019s concerns over litigation. \u201cI think it is going to be important if things mess up, that the penalties that are in place, the accountability measures that are in place, really do get implemented and are adhered to by the developer management team.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A condo was one of\nAustin\u2019s top sales\nlast week, disrupting a long streak of single-family dominance.\nUnit 48Y in the Austonian was the second-priciest public residential sale in the city, according to the Eklund Gomes Team. The sale price is undisclosed, but the sellers, E. Dale and Nancy Lowe, were asking $3.75 million, or $1,442 per square foot, when the condo sold.\nThe 2,600-square-foot condo has three bedrooms, four bathrooms and \u201cthe signature view\u201d of the capitol and the University of Texas campus, said listing agent Trey Phillips of Eric Moreland Group.\nIts layout is unique to the building, he said. It was designed by local architect Ryan Street.\nFor the past few weeks, homes in Barton Creek and other\nwestern neighborhoods\nhave led sales. Last week, though, both of the top two sales were centrally located, with a single-family home about a mile from the Austonian taking the top spot.\nAgents tend to list downtown properties\npublicly\nbecause there\u2019s less of a discrepancy between property tax appraisals and actual market values compared to West Austin homes, Phillips said.\nBuilt in 2010 by Benchmark Development and Grupo Villar Mir\n, the Austonian is\none of Austin\u2019s first condo towers\n. Prices declined after 2022, but downtown Austin condos are seeing demand from downsizing seniors, traveling executives who need second homes, and young professionals.\n\u201cThe buyer that is buying it is local. He splits time between here and the East Coast, but his primary residence is Austin. And, life phase-wise, he\u2019s an empty nester, so he doesn\u2019t need a big house any longer,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s our number-one buyer profile, folks coming from big, beautiful homes in West Austin.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been weeks since a condo landed in the top two sales, but a\nW Residences\ncondo asking $4.75 million sold at the end of September. A\n$5 million unit at Independent\nsold in February, and there were\ntwo condo sales over $2 million in one week\nin March. A\n$6.75 million home at the Four Seasons Residences\nsold in April.\n",

        "content": "A Texas investor\u2019s Union Square shopping spree bagged another retail building.\nxt, bought the five-floor, 32,000-square-foot retail building at 240 Post Street, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe exact purchase price has not been disclosed, but the 240 Post LLC that MacMahon created for the deal raised $33 million for the purchase. That works out to $1,031 per square foot.\nThe seller was Teachers Insurance &amp; Annuity Association of America, which had owned it since 2012. Eastdil Secured brokered the deal, and Cushman &amp; Wakefield is likely to stay on as the leasing agent.\nThe deal is MacMahon\u2019s latest in San Francisco, with the investor\u2019s efforts concentrated in the rebounding\nUnion Square\narea. In August, MacMahon\nbought the seven-story One Union Square building\nfor $42.5 million. Last year, he bought properties including the Burberry building at 225 Post Street in Union Square; after that, he picked up 11 retail properties in five buildings in and around Hayes Valley for $10.9 million.\nOther recent Union Square-area buyers include Beverly Hills-based\nBijan Chadorchi, who bought\n251 Post for $30.5 million last month. Alaska-based Fountainhead Development\nbought 800 Market Street\n, dubbed the \u201cflatiron\u201d of San Francisco, for $17.2 million last month. Ian Jacobs, a scion of the Reichmann real estate empire, has similarly\nstaked his claim in the Union Square area\nthis year by\nbuying up three prominent properties\nalong Powell Street.\nUnion Square and other parts of downtown are rising from the pandemic ashes as tenants flock back to previously vacant storefronts.\nPowell Street\n, for example, has attracted buzzy tenants like Nintendo and Pop Mart. Zara also moved back into the neighborhood, at 250 Post, after closing its flagship earlier this year. And luxury retailers like Apple, Tiffany &amp; Co., Breitling, Rolex, Patek Philippe, A. Lange &amp; S\u00f6hne and St. John have all set up shop in the area in recent years.\nMacMahon\u2019s tear across downtown doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s over yet.\n\u201cMy partners and I are long-term investors, and we believe San Francisco in the long-term is a great market for investing in real estate,\u201d the investor told\nThe Real Deal\nlast year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Related Companies\u2019 expansive promise for the Western Rail Yards is one step closer to reality \u2014 or at least one step closer to a\nhandsome tax break\n.\nThe city\u2019s Industrial Development Agency approved a resolution that amends the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy in the area with the Hudson Yards development site, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The expansion of the relevant zone, notably, is not the same as Related receiving its desired tax break.\nThe 15-person board \u2014 partially stacked with mayoral appointees \u2014 almost unanimously approved the change to the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy. The exception was Comptroller Brad Lander, who supports the project, but not its use of city funds.\n\u201cWe are concerned that in its current configuration, the economics of the project appear to rely too heavily on the city\u2019s intervention to the benefit of the private developer and the MTA,\u201d Lander said in a statement.\nRelated did not comment on the vote to the outlet.\nJeff Blau\u2019s firm is seeking a $2 billion tax break from the city to fund the construction of a platform over the open rail tracks. Critics of the proposed tax break view it as a bailout for the developer to build a large project on the taxpayer dime.\nUltimately, Related is looking to build four mixed-use towers on the site that will deliver approximately 4,000 residential units, green space and a school.\nThe City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of the site back in June, a month after Related dropped its bid to put a casino on the site. The changes to the 2009 rezoning of the site also allowed for an office building and a hotel.\nRelated previously indicated that the housing units will primarily be rentals. The Adams administration announced the developer had committed to a\nminimum of 625 affordable apartments\n, up from 400. The pledge is likely driven by affordability requirements of\nthe 485x property tax break\n.\nTo score its IDA tax break, Related will still need to complete the IDA application and review process, which could take roughly three months. That means Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration \u2014 which\nBlau reportedly sought to prevent\nby rallying fellow business bigwigs \u2014 will likely have a say in whether or not Related actually lands the financing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The city\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board approved the proposal in October, and the commission will vote on it on Thursday on first reading. The measure requires a second reading vote.\nThe proposal would target high demand areas, but only two have been identified, and both are in Edgewater, stretching from the Julia Tuttle Causeway south to Northeast Eighth Street, according to Spotlight. It would also include\nWatson Island\n, where a pair of new projects are planned.\nCommissioner Damian Pardo is sponsoring the legislation.\nThe fund would pay for projects like raising streets, replacing\nseawalls\nand installing pump stations. The money collected by the city would generally have to stay in the same area, and any development that costs more than $100,000 would require commission approval.\nIncreasing density could put further strain on infrastructure and accelerate gentrification even more, critics said.\nEdgewater\u2019s streets will flood during a rainstorm, damaging cars and homes. The neighborhood is also experiencing a huge increase in new developments. Last month, the Miami Urban Development Review Board approved\nthe design\nfor a 47-story mixed-use high-rise with nearly 500 apartments for the site at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard, which is for sale. Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group also recently announced they are partnering with hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian to launch a\nbranded condo tower\nat 422 Northeast 29th Street.\nAaron DeMayo, who chairs the city\u2019s Climate Resilience Committee, supports the proposal, but said he found it \u201csomewhat ironic that we\u2019re incentivizing additional development capacity in an area that obviously is already flooding significantly.\u201d\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

The facility is part of the 27-acre Pacific Gateway Business Park, which totals 550,000 square feet across two properties. The distribution center was completed in 2002 and has 40-foot maximum clear heights, a drive-in door and 27 dock-high loading doors.\nAres has been active with other industrial and commercial deals across the country this year. In September, it beefed up its industrial holdings in South Florida with the acquisition of a 230,976-square-foot warehouse in Weston for $56 million, or about $242 per square foot. In January, Ares sold a 424-unit\nsenior living complex in Wellington\n, Florida, for $101.1 million.\nThe seemingly break-even deal for Ares runs counter to the general market. Industrial properties in the Los Angeles region have been trading hands briskly this year as the market heats up from post-pandemic doldrums. In May, Terreno Realty Corporation\nsold the five-building Garfield Business Center\nin Commerce for $97 million, more than a decade after buying it in 2012 for $52.4 million. In September,\nMetLife Investment Management sold\na three-property, 600,000-square-foot industrial portfolio with buildings in Redondo Beach, City of Industry and San Diego for a total of $165.5 million. Earlier this month, Bridge Logistics Properties made one of the biggest single-asset industrial deals in Southern California this year with the purchase of a\n1.1 million-square-foot warehouse in Fontana\nfor $174 million.\nGreater Los Angeles, bolstered by the Inland Empire, is the nation\u2019s largest industrial market, with more than 1.7 billion square feet of industrial space across the region and another 17.8 million square feet under construction, per Colliers data\ncited\nby Supply Chain 24/7. Real estate investment volume in L.A. was $1.9 billion in the first nine months of the year, placing it in the top 10 nationally,\naccording\nto Yardi Matrix.

Their firm specializes in restoring Hollywood Regency, Mid-Century Modern and Victorian properties.\nThe Hollywood Regency-style residence on Blue Jay Way boasts glass doors with views of the city and ocean.\nThe five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home spans 9,800 square feet. Amenities include a 14-seat screening room, 500-bottle wine cellar and spa. On the roof is a garden with more than 80 fruit trees. Also growing are vegetables, strawberries and herbs.\nNot far behind the Bird Streets home was last week\u2019s second-largest signed contract based on asking price.

But if it sells for its asking price, it would be the record sale for New Buffalo, beating an off-market deal for $8.5 million in 2023.\nAt 11781 Marquette Drive, the home has eight bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. It sits on a half-acre lot on the Lake Michigan shoreline and has 7,200 square-feet of living space.\nThe home, built in 2020, has large windows that look out over Lake Michigan. It is part of the Riviera Home Owners Association, a neighborhood group that has shared private beach access.\nThe house is listed by @properties Christies International Real Estate agent Liz Roch, who did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe home is owned under a trust associated with Mary Mcnaughton. Mcnaughton bought the land in 2019 for $1.85 million and the house was constructed in 2020.\nThe potential sale follows other big deals in New Buffalo this fall that have put demand for luxury waterfront homes in the area on vivid display. The town is a popular vacation spot for Chicagoans and a sought-after second home location.\nTwo homes that both asked nearly $7 million, also on Marquette Drive and also listed by Roch, found buyers after only a few days on the market last month.\nOne of those homes, at 11561 Marquette Drive, went on the market Oct. 2 and went under contract with a buyer Oct. 5. The other, a home owned by former Illinois\nRepublican House Speaker Lee Daniels\n, went on the market Oct. 16 asking $7 million and went under contract Oct. 22.\nEarlier this year,\nMalort Maker Tremaine Atkinson\nfound a buyer for his 8,500-square-foot New Buffalo home listed at $6 million. And in the nearby town of Union Pier,\nDRW Holdings founder and CEO Don Wilson\noffloaded his lakeshore home for $7 million in March.\nThe second home market near Chicago has been red-hot this year, with\nWisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva\nseeing a string of $8 million-plus home sales this fall with its ceiling hitting $20 million, and luxury sales along the North Shore fetching record-breaking sale prices.\n",

        "content": "A puzzling redevelopment site in one of Chicago\u2019s western suburbs is back in play, and this time the pitch is far simpler.\nD.R. Horton floated a plan to turn the former Northern Baptist Theological Seminary campus in\nLombard\nnear Yorktown Center into a 159-unit townhouse community, putting a strictly residential concept on a property that has defied more ambitious visions for nearly a decade, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\nThe seminary decamped for Lisle in 2017, leaving behind a 27-acre parcel east of the mall. Initial redevelopment concepts \u2014 anchored by a golf driving range, a Moretti\u2019s restaurant and an apartment component \u2014 never advanced beyond planning.\nNow\nD.R. Horton\n, which built the Summit at Yorktown townhomes along the mall\u2019s ring road, is looking to send its trajectory west.\nEarly reactions from\nLombard\u2019s\nplan commission suggest the more modest proposal may finally fit the site\u2019s realities.\nThe parcel is oddly shaped, constrained by wetlands and a large detention pond along its southern edge. Most of the buildable land is tucked away from major thoroughfares like Butterfield Road and 22nd Street, limiting commercial potential. Several commissioners said a residential focus makes sense given those limitations and the momentum of nearby multifamily development.\nThe previous master plan would have added convenience retail, a gas station and up to 400 apartments. None materialized. Campus structures have since been demolished, and the village has acquired a sliver of the land for a new water tower, now moving into construction. Everything else remains untouched.\nD.R. Horton\u2019s\nconcept is still early and would require rezoning and an amendment to Lombard\u2019s comprehensive plan. Village staff and the plan commission have given informal feedback, but no application has been submitted. If the deal moves ahead, the builder would be required to provide preliminary engineering and architectural plans.\nThe project is an extension of a broader strategy by Horton to deepen its presence in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs. Cole Tyrell, the company\u2019s regional vice president, said in a statement that the company has been aware of the site for a couple years now, and while the plan is intended as for-sale housing, D.R. Horton wants to maintain flexibility as the entitlement process unfolds and market conditions shift.\nThe Texas-based builder, the largest in the country, hopes to secure approvals and start construction in late 2026 and begin sales in 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Safeway will survive, however, as plans call for a 56,000-square-foot replacement Safeway store on the ground floor.\nAlign is moving fast to redevelop Safeway stores across the city.\nIt also plans to redevelop the Safeway at 850 La Playa Street in the Outer Richmond District into 526 rental units across two eight-story buildings. Similar to the Bernal Heights plan, it would raze the 37,000-square-foot Safeway and replace it with housing anchored by a 59,000-square-foot grocery store on the ground floor.\nAlign\nshared its first Safeway redevelopment proposal\nlast month. That project would turn a recently closed\nSafeway store in the Fillmore District at 1335 Webster Street\ninto 1,800 apartments. The real estate firm has a deal to buy the property from Safeway.\nThe Bernal Heights proposal could run into opposition from neighborhood residents. Two\naffordable housing projects\nnear the Safeway site are under development but faced pushback from neighbors along the way.\nAlign can skirt the 40-foot height limit for a building that rises 75 feet and skip over a lengthy local public review process by setting aside a portion of the units as affordable housing.\nOf the 370 proposed units, 51 would be set aside as income-restricted for low-income and very-low-income households. The plan would add more than seven times as many affordable homes as have been built in Bernal Heights over the past two decades.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A new conference center spans two floors and can host up to 150 people, while the former 60th-floor Sky Lobby has been reimagined as a tenants-only \u201cSky Lounge.\u201d\nThe aesthetic centerpiece is a glass pyramid entry inspired by the Louvre \u2014 a subtle nod to I.M.

Restaurant tenants and outdoor seating areas aimed at creating pedestrian engagement have also helped the building stand out in a downtown still battling post-pandemic foot traffic challenges. The refresh has been key to Hines retaining existing tenants and winning new ones, Beasley said.\nHKS is active in Houston\u2019s civic and institutional planning. Earlier this year, it was among several architecture groups that submitted concepts for a potential overhaul of\nNRG Park\n. HKS\u2019 contributions centered on layouts for NRG Arena, though broader master planning is in progress, and no redesigns have been approved.\nBeasley\u2019s team has stayed busy elsewhere, recently brokering a 4,000-square-foot lease for Trammell P.C. at San Felipe Place in River Oaks. The deal brought the boutique Class A building to more than 95 percent leased, a notable benchmark in a market where newer trophy-level space is scarce.

        "content": "As we near the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 first and final term, several projects, rezonings and other real estate-related issues will stretch into the next administration.\nThat includes, of course, the Elizabeth Street Garden drama. The site\u2019s selected developers\nfiled a lawsuit\nWednesday, alleging that the administration unlawfully designated the property city parkland. The complaint alleges that such a change needs to go through the city\u2019s land-use review process.\nSo, this issue will continue to play out in court and then in the next administration.\nThe trajectory of another approved project may also depend on the new mayor. In July, the City Council\napproved\nOne45, a three-building project with 1,000 units, of which 338 will be permanently affordable. Before approval, developer Bruce Teitelbaum signed an agreement with Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, pledging to negotiate with city officials and nonprofits to possibly increase the number of affordable units. Such a move would require public subsidy, which has not materialized.\nOn Thursday, the New York Interfaith Commission on Housing Equality\u2019s Defend Harlem campaign is hosting a rally near the development site, at 145th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, to call on the city and state to provide public subsidy to increase affordable housing on the site. Kai Cogsville, a representative for Defend Harlem, said he wants to see units affordable to those earning between $34,000 and $65,0000 a year, or roughly between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income.\n\u201cThose are the people who have been excluded the most,\u201d he said.\nTeitelbaum said in a statement that he is \u201cnot unmindful\u201d of the concerns raised by Defend Harlem, but\nadded, \u201cwe cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\u201cWe are on record in support of building as much genuinely affordable housing as possible, but that requires the cooperation of City Hall,\u201d he said.\nHe said he\u2019s spoken to current administration officials several times to no avail.\n\u201cIt is a conversation we are willing to have with the Mayor-elect, but time is of the essence,\u201d he said.\nOf course, the city has other projects in its pipeline. During fiscal year 2025, the city financed the creation or preservation of 28,281 units of affordable housing, which is 11 percent more than the previous year. Of that, 13,361 were new and 14,920 were preservation units.\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t a public database where I can see what projects are in that pipeline and where exactly they stand. But many of those projects will likely also stretch into the next administration.\nKeep an eye out for more coverage of issues and projects that may be taken up by the next mayor.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCity Hall says it has the authority to declare city-owned land a park without going through Ulurp to map a use change. Does it? Send a note (and examples) to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nICYMI, the Department of Buildings on Tuesday unveiled six new sidewalk shed designs \u2014 three by Practice for Architecture and Urbanism and three by Arup. Contractors will be able to pull permits for these designs once DOB finishes the rulemaking process for applying the new shed types.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch says she is ready to be part of the Mamdani administration\n,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The Mayor-elect said in October that he planned to ask Tisch to stay on as commissioner, and on Wednesday, she confirmed that she would accept the position.\n\u2014\nMohamed Bahi, former aide to Mayor Eric Adams, was sentenced to three years of probation Tuesday for arranging illegal straw donations to the mayor\u2019s campaigns,\nthe City reports\n. \u201cThere\u2019s a notable absence here of the person at the apex of the pyramid,\u201d Manhattan Federal Judge Dale Ho said, referring to Adams. (Ho dismissed the\nfederal charges\nagainst Adams at the behest of the Department of Justice but was critical of the request.)\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 10,500-square-foot home at 3 Point Crescent in Whitestone. Helen Keit and Ross Keit with Keller Williams Realty Landmark\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was for\n$30 million\nfor 425 Seventh Avenue in Penn Plaza. United Pacific Development Corp sold the property to the Oved Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 5,264-square-foot condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Barbara Russo, Christopher Salierno, Elena Sarkissian and MariaElena Scotto with Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 284,340-square-foot, 17-story, 300-unit project at 332 Beach 52nd Street in Far Rockaway. Ariel Aufgang filed the permit on behalf of Tishman Speyer.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Infamous Manhattan landlord Steve Croman is dealing with more than 28 active foreclosure lawsuits targeting properties he controls. In total, lenders allege Croman\u2019s entities have defaulted on more than $231 million in loan principals.\nIt\u2019s just the latest legal challenge for Croman, one of the few New York landlords to see the inside of a prison cell.\nTwenty-one of the foreclosure suits were filed in the last week by lender Orange Owner LLC. The principal of those associated loans totals more than $189 million, according to a tally by\nThe Real Deal\n. Orange Owner LLC took over the notes after the collapse of New York Community Bank, where Croman had originally gone for financing.\nBut Orange Owner isn\u2019t the only lender seeking payback from Croman. Delaware Trust Company, acting as a trustee for another lender, has\nfiled seven suits\nagainst Croman\u2019s entities, going back to this summer. Principal on those loans totals $42.4 million.\nDelaware Trust accused Croman of failing to pay insurance and water bills for those properties. In a court filing, Croman denied many of the allegations. However, neither he nor lawyers representing him at Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein LLP immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe properties facing foreclosure span much of Manhattan, from Nolita and Chinatown to Yorkville and the Upper East Side.\nCroman, once\ndubbed\none of the city\u2019s worst multifamily landlords, is perhaps used to the hot seat. After years of accusations that he defrauded and harassed tenants, Croman entered a settlement with the New York attorney general\u2019s office in 2017 to pay $8 million in tenant restitution and hand over management of his properties for five years. That same year, he completed an eight-month prison stint for mortgage and tax fraud.\nSeparately, Croman was\nsued this summer by his father\n, Edward. The elder Croman is hoping to dissolve 63 limited companies he is part of with his son, alleging that he hasn\u2019t received disbursements, loans haven\u2019t been repaid and the deterioration of his relationship with Steve has made running the companies impractical.\nThe past weeks\u2019 foreclosures were previously reported by\nCrain\u2019s\nand the\nNew York Post\n, but the number of suits has since increased.\nKelly Schneid of Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff, representing Orange Owner LLC in the suits, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Christopher Gorman of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, representing Delaware Trust Company, declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Zillow is pointing out the racial makeup of neighborhoods for homes sold without being publicly listed in its latest attack on Chicago\u2019s MLS over its\nPrivate Listing Network\n.\nChicago-area homes in majority white neighborhoods are more than twice as likely to be listed on the private platform compared to homes in majority non-white areas, Zillow highlighted in an analysis published Thursday morning.\nZillow claims exclusive marketing practices like the Private Listing Network threaten fair housing standards and reinforce segregated neighborhoods. Chicago\u2019s MLS operator, Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED), created the network in 2016 as a listing option for Chicago-area brokers that displays offerings to all other agents subscribed to MRED, but keeps them off public platforms like Zillow.\n\u201cThe data show clear disparities, and good intentions are no longer an excuse for expanding digital redlining,\u201d Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy said.\nThe critique comes as Zillow this year rolled out\nListing Access Standards\nthat require listings to be made available on public portals within one business day of being publicly marketed. The rules, largely a reaction to office-exclusive listings like the marketing strategy\nchampioned by Compass\n, would also limit how Chicago-area brokers can use the Private Listing Network.\nChicago is one of the few markets where Zillow hasn\u2019t begun enforcing the standards, but under the rules, listings that start on the private network and then move to the standard MLS would be blocked from showing up on Zillow after their transitions.\nAccording to Zillow, it examined more than 40,000 listings available on Chicago\u2019s MLS on Oct. 21, controlling for factors like price, home type, location and broker activity. The study found that 7.9 percent of homes in majority-white neighborhoods were on the Private Listing Network, compared to 3.4 percent in majority-non-white neighborhoods.\nThe data is a \u201ccautionary example as some large brokerages are pushing to expand private marketing of homes nationwide \u2014 a trend poised to amplify inequity if it spreads,\u201d Zillow said.\nIn a March essay detailing the Private Listing Network, MRED acknowledged the fair housing concerns that private listings present. It argued the MLS-wide platform, which shows listings to all brokers in the MLS, limits those concerns by spreading beyond a single agent or brokerage\u2019s network.\n\u201cRequiring listings to be visible to all MLS subscribers helps ensure transparency, broad access, and reduces the risk of discriminatory steering, whether intentional or inadvertent,\u201d the MRED paper said.\nMRED has\ndug in on defending\nits private network, suggesting Zillow\u2019s standards are a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d policy that ignores sensitive life events \u2014 like divorce, death or illness \u2014 that could cause a homeowner to want more privacy in listings.\nPractically, the Private Listing Network is used often by sellers who want to test their home price and limit the number of days on the market before going public.\nZillow has bashed the Private Listing Network and reached out to managing brokers warning that offerings that use the system would violate its standards, but it has not said when it will start enforcing its rules. MRED previously said blocking certain listings may be a violation of its agreement with Zillow that allows the site to display MRED offerings.\nMRED also published its own data in the March essay, highlighting stats it said prove the benefits of the private network. According to the paper, the average private listing closed for 90.7 percent of its list price compared to 86.9 percent for public offerings in 2024. Private listings also spent less time on the market on average, at 29 days in 2024, compared to 44 days for public listings.\nZillow\u2019s data, though, reinforces the home search giant\u2019s argument that private listings distort the housing market and lead to unequal access for consumers. The company pointed to 2018 research that found pocket listings can unintentionally contribute to segregation, by limiting private listings to an agent\u2019s network. White agents are more likely to work with white clients, the study said, while Black and Latino agents are more likely to work with non-white clients.\nThe spat over the Private Listing Network \u2014 a feature that among MLSes at large is relatively unique to MRED \u2014 is playing out as a\ntrial is underway\nin the lawsuit Compass brought against Zillow over its listing rules. Compass has alleged Zillow is unfairly leveraging monopoly power to stifle competition.\n",

        "content": "Another downtown Chicago\napartment tower\nis up for grabs, adding to a growing list of landlords looking to cash in on a rental market that keeps defying gravity.\nTexas-based 3L Real Estate hired JLL to market Astoria Tower, a 30-story, 248-unit property at 8 East 9th Street in the\nSouth Loop\n, according to a marketing flyer, first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe timing isn\u2019t subtle. Downtown Chicago\nrents jumped\nmore than 8 percent year over year in the third quarter, the biggest annual increase in three years, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nWith little new construction in the pipeline and\ndemand holding firm\n, the supply squeeze is pushing rents higher and coaxing owners to the sales market after several years defined by interest-rate volatility.\n3L\nacquired Astoria Tower in 2022 for $82.5 million, or roughly $333,000 a unit, per CoStar. The building\u2019s backstory mirrors the arc of the last condo cycle: originally delivered as for-sale units in 2009, the tower struggled during the post-crash downturn.\nCrescent Heights\nscooped up 205 condos in 2010, operated them as rentals and began buying out remaining owners in 2019 to execute a full condo deconversion into rental units.\nToday Astoria Tower is 97 percent occupied, JLL\u2019s materials show. Brokers David Gaines and Bill Baumann are positioning the property as having value-added potential \u2014 the kind of asset investors often chase when rent growth is strong but new inventory is limited. The pitch: refresh the units, modernize amenities and capture even higher rents in a neighborhood where renter demand is resilient.\nThe building offers studios through three-bedrooms with monthly rents ranging from $1,832 to $4,600.\n3L didn\u2019t comment on the listing, but the firm has been an active player in Chicago\u2019s middle-market multifamily sector. Its local holdings include the converted former\nEbony and Jet\nmagazine building at 820 South Michigan Avenue and other South Loop and Hyde Park properties. Across its portfolio, 3L said it controls more than 1,700 units, with another 1,000-plus in development.\nAstoria\u2019s appearance on the market underscores a broader shift: after years of stalled transaction volume, more downtown owners see an opening. With fundamentals this tight and pricing momentum back, investor interest \u2014 at least for well-located, cash-flowing buildings \u2014 may have room to climb.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The announcement is the latest sign the company isn\u2019t rushing to shutter the landmark.\nSaks\n, which acquired\nNeiman Marcus Group\nlate last year in a $2.7 billion deal, said in a statement that it is \u201ccommitting to serving its loyal customer base in Dallas\u201d while planning unfolds into next year.\nThat reassurance follows a whiplash-inducing end to last year, when Saks targeted a January closure before bumping the date to March.\nThe prospect of losing a pillar of Dallas retail \u2014 the store opened in 1907 and helped cement the city\u2019s fashion credentials \u2014 triggered a civic pushback rare for the department-store sector. City officials, business leaders and even developers stepped in, arguing that the flagship is essential to Main Street\u2019s identity and\ndowntown\u2019s momentum\n.\nThose efforts paid off. Dallas City Manager Kim Tolbert said the city \u201ccelebrates\u201d the extension and will continue working with Saks Global Executive Chairman Richard Baker on a long-term path to keep Neiman\u2019s downtown. Tolbert noted the store\u2019s role in elevating Dallas as a global retail destination and said its presence remains woven into the neighborhood\u2019s cultural fabric.\nStill, questions linger about what to do with the real estate. At more than 100,000 square feet and nine floors, the building offers flexibility.\nConcepts floated in recent years include an events venue and a fashion museum honoring Neiman\u2019s legacy.\nMeanwhile, Saks is planning roughly $100 million in renovations at the Neiman\u2019s store in NorthPark Center, underscoring a broader reinvestment strategy even as the future of downtown\u2019s location is unresolved.\nThe timing adds a layer of urgency.\nDallas\nis preparing for the 2026 FIFA\nWorld Cup\nand reassessing aging real estate across downtown. What happens at Neiman\u2019s will feed directly into that conversation.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The classic example of old, energy-wasting buildings in New York is residents opening their windows in winter to let the heat out. Landlords must set the thermostat high enough to keep the coldest apartment warm, which makes the warmest units hot.\nSome folks call this the \u201clowest common denominator problem.\u201d\nMany newer apartment buildings, however, have a different energy-wasting issue that\u2019s not so obvious: Their HVAC systems are running all the time, even when they are not needed.\nThese systems have various features that prevent units from getting too hot or too cold, so nobody\u2019s opening windows. But energy is being wasted nonetheless \u2014 behind the walls and out of sight.\nStartup founder Brad Pilgrim offered an analogy:\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you drink coffee once or twice a day. What if the coffeemaker runs 24-7-365? That\u2019s kind of how a building runs.\u201d\nPilgrim launched a Toronto company called Parity in 2017 to fix this problem. Then he looked for cities with cold winters and hot summers, high energy costs and many of the buildings in which Parity\u2019s product would work best.\nNew York, with its pricey utility rates and bounty of high-rise rentals, co-ops, condos and hotels, was the motherlode. The city added a third factor when it passed Local Law 97, creating an emissions cap for large buildings. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a triple threat,\u201d Pilgrim said.\nToday, Parity does more than half of its business in New York. It also operates in Boston, New Jersey, California, Toronto and the Washington, D.C., metro area.\nThe company targets mid-rise multifamily to high-rise luxury buildings of roughly 75,000 square feet where the equipment is not working together to efficiently control the temperature. Its platform reads what that equipment is doing and then constantly sends back new operating instructions to reduce (or increase) production to meet demand.\nEssentially, it aims to ensure the HVAC system\nuses as little power as possible\nto maintain comfort. If a piece of equipment cannot be controlled by Parity\u2019s platform, the company finds something off-the-shelf to make that happen, rather than sell buildings a custom product.\n\u201cOur typical customers see a payback of 2 to 2.5 years,\u201d Pilgrim claimed, pointing to case studies on Parity\u2019s website. The company charges a fee for installation and for monthly service.\nTo reassure skeptical building owners, it guarantees energy savings and cuts them a check if it falls short. But even that is not enough to convince some of them.\nI asked Pilgrim why.\n\u201cEnergy is invisible, it\u2019s not tangible. It\u2019s not like a lobby retrofit,\u201d he said. \u201cHVAC optimization and energy management is complicated, and you don\u2019t see it. So it\u2019s more difficult for someone to tie value to it.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cReal estate tends to be a very pragmatist vertical,\u201d where people invest in the familiar. To some, his product \u2014 which only became possible with the advent of cloud computing \u2014 \u201csounds too good to be true.\u201d\nVenture capitalists have bet on Parity, which\nraised $19 million\nlast year in a Series B funding round led by Idealist Capital. It has fewer than 50 employees and a customer portfolio of nearly 100 million square feet.\nExtreme weather is not the company\u2019s sweet spot, because it doesn\u2019t deliver savings when an HVAC system is firing on all cylinders, such as during a heat wave. However, it does pre-condition buildings in anticipation of peak consumption hours, to reduce a building\u2019s consumption when the grid is stretched to its limit.\nLast June, when a blackout was narrowly avoided, Parity helped about 30 buildings reduce their electricity consumption by about 1 megawatt as part of a \u201cdemand response\u201d program, Pilgrim said, adding that Parity is not a\ndemand response aggregator\n. It can also tailor usage to reduce consumption when rates are highest.\nMany proptech firms, consultants and contractors are marketing ways for buildings to reduce their power use. Their selling point is to save property owners money, but effective products and projects also help the state meet its\nclimate goals\nand, perhaps more urgently, reduce demand on a grid that is getting closer to being unreliable during peak-use periods.\nIn fact, the New York Independent Systems Operator recently warned that the city\u2019s grid might not be reliable\nas soon as next year\n. \u201cStrain on the grid,\u201d Pilgrim said, \u201cis becoming a real problem.\u201d\n",

But Davis and Conrad claim they entered into a limited agreement with a fictional entity, CAHS Construction, which the complaint says was created by the Stewarts to protect themselves legally.\nThe conditions of that agreement were not followed, according to the complaint, and subsequent attempts to negotiate additional terms were used as \u201ca front to buy them time\u201d without needing to pay license or professional fees.\nThe Stewarts currently have a partial stop-work order from the Department of Buildings and 10 open violations on their property, according to public records. The partial stop-work order states that supported pipe scaffolding was installed \u201ccontrary to approved plans\u201d with \u201cmultiple make-shift components\u201d that have created \u201chazardous and unsafe\u201d conditions for the property at 5 East 81st Street.\nConard and Davis are seeking monetary damages and an injunction on the work.\nStewart bought the home, which had previously served as a rental building, in November 2019 for $9.9 million, one month after taking over as Sotheby\u2019s CEO.\n",

        "content": "The Boca Raton City Council unanimously approved plans by the city\u2019s housing authority and Miami-based Atlantic Pacific Companies to add 105 apartments to a decades-old affordable housing complex.\nThe zoning changes will enable Atlantic Pacific and the Boca Raton Housing Authority to build two new three-story apartment buildings with 54 one-bedroom units, 42 two-bedroom units and nine three-bedroom units in the southern portion of the Residences at Martin Manor, a 10-acre affordable apartment community at 1350 North Dixie Highway.\nOriginally known as Dixie Manor, what was once a 95-unit complex will be redeveloped by Atlantic Pacific into a modern complex with a total of 200 apartments. As part of its transformation, most of the original buildings are being demolished.\n\u201cDixie Manor was developed many moons ago, between the 1940s and 1980s, and [the buildings] were in disrepair,\u201d Ele Zachariades, Atlantic Pacific\u2019s lobbyist, told the council at its meeting on Tuesday.\nBut one 1940s-era, 4,650-square-foot building will be preserved with half the space transformed into a museum for Pearl City, a once segregated neighborhood for African Americans that was founded in 1915 and predated the existence of Boca Raton.\nAtlantic Pacific, led by CEO Howard Cohen, and the Housing Authority opted to expand the number of units due to the large waiting list for affordable apartments in Boca Raton, Zachariades added.\nThe new apartments built on site will be reserved for households earning between 30 percent and 80 percent of area median income, said Ashley Whidby, executive director of the Boca Raton Housing Authority. As of 2025, for a one-person household, 30 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s AMI is $24,570, while 80 percent of AMI is $65,520, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\nA real estate development and management company, Atlantic Pacific Communities won a bid to redevelop Dixie Manor in 2024.\nAtlantic Pacific is also planning other affordable housing projects in South Florida, including\na 600-unit affordable apartment complex\nnear St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Leisure City; a\n71-unit affordable housing\nbuilding near the shuttered Carver Theater in Liberty City; and an eight-story\naffordable and workforce housing project with 375 apartments\nin Miami\u2019s Overtown. Atlantic Pacific and Casa Familia will also\ncollaborate to build 124 apartments for disabled adults in Kendall\n.Among other projects in Boca Raton planned to include affordable housing, 900 Broken Sound Acquisition, LLC and an affiliate of Atlanta-based Peachtree Group won approval in June to develop\na 289-unit, mixed-unit apartment building\nat 900 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway that will include 44 workforce and affordable housing units. And investment firm Oak Lane Partners plans a\n243-unit Live Local Act apartment project\nnear its office building at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard that will include 38 affordable and workforce apartments and townhouses.",

        "content": "While some Chetrits are facing serious charges tied to alleged tenant harassment, Michael Chetrit\u2019s firm is having a better time of things, restructuring a troubled loan on the Upper East Side.\nThe Chetrit Organization modified the\n$714 million debt\nbacking the Yorkshire Towers at 305 East 86th Street and Lexington Towers at 160 East 88th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The modification brings the CMBS loan current, waives guarantees in the original deal and pushes back the loan\u2019s maturity date, previously scheduled for June 2027.\nThe restructuring came after months of negotiations with lender Rialto Capital and subordinate debtholders based in both the United States and South Korea. The debt is split between a $539.5 million CMBS loan and $174.5 million in mezzanine debt.\n\u201cThis modification allows us to continue investing our time and resources into enhancing and stabilizing the property, ensuring it reaches its fullest potential,\u201d Chetrit said in a statement.\nIron Hound Management\u2019s Anthony D\u2019Amelio arranged the restructuring.\nThe CMBS loan was\nsent to special servicing\nat the end of last year. Yorkshire is the bigger of the two buildings with 692 units, about one-third of which are\nrent stabilized\n; about half of Lexington\u2019s 149 units are regulated.\nChetrit and the Gluck family of Stellar Management planned to renovate 311 units across the two buildings, according to Morningstar. The towers hold a combined 305 rent-stabilized units, but it was unclear how many of the planned renovations they managed to execute after the loan was sent to special servicing.\nNet cash flow suffered, in part because of falling occupancy. The buildings were 97 percent full when the original loan was made in mid-2022; as of December 2023, they were 89 percent leased.\nRevenue fell 24 percent in that period, while expenses rose 16 percent. Rent collections at the end of 2023 were still covering 1.6 times mortgage payments. But that figure, known as the debt service coverage ratio, slipped from 3.6 in 2022.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "Advenir bought a 249-unit apartment building in Pompano Beach for $60.9 million, amid an uptick in multifamily investment sales in South Florida.\nAventura-based Advenir bought the six-story Bell Lighthouse Point at 4611 North Federal Highway from Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer assumed the seller\u2019s $37.6 million outstanding loan balance and amended the debt to a $53.3 million Freddie Mac loan.\nCompleted in 2015 on a 5.3-acre site, Bell Lighthouse Point consists of one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, Vizzda records show. Monthly rents aren\u2019t listed on the property\u2019s website. The sale equates to $244,578 per apartment.\nBell Partners, led by Lili F. Dunn, had paid $58.5 million for the building in 2019, according to records.\nLed by Stephen L. Vecchitto and David Vecchitto, Advenir is a multifamily and single-family rentals developer, investor and manager, according to its website. Since it was founded in 1996, it has owned and managed more than 30,000 units, and its current portfolio is valued at $2.9 billion.\nThe deal comes on the heels of Advenir\u2019s\n$117.9 million\nsale of the 542-unit Palm Beach Gardens Apartments complex at 4120 Union Square Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens. Boston-based West Shore bought the property.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared with the leasing and investment sales bonanza that ensued from out-of-staters creating unprecedented demand and record rent growth. Developers seized on the boom with a flurry of new projects, delivering a record\n18,600 units last year\n, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group data. This created a\nsupply overhang\n, slowing lease-ups of new projects and increasing concessions. At Bell Lighthouse Point, prospective tenants could get a $99 \u201cmove in special,\u201d according to the property\u2019s website.\nInvestment sales have picked up over the past year, despite elevated interest rates. Many buyers are assuming sellers\u2019 debt, or relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans and financing from insurance firms.\nBell Partners\u2019 Pompano Beach sale marks at least the second South Florida property it has sold in as many months. Last month, the firm sold the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\nto Tishman Speyer.\nThis month, Pantzer Properties bought the 393-unit, eight-story apartment building at 1-3 Main Street in Miramar for\n$161 million\n. Last month, Morgan Properties paid\n$70 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond complex at 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County.\n",

        "content": "Fountain Valley is charging forward with one of its largest housing proposals in years.\nCity officials signed off on the affordable housing component agreement for the\nEuclid + Heil residential project from Bill Shopoff\u2019s Shopoff Realty Investments\n, acting through the entity Euclid &amp; Heil FV Owner, Voice of OC\nreported\n. The proposal calls for building 606 units on an 18-acre site at 16300 Euclid Street near Mile Square Regional Park that was once a strawberry field.\nThe plans call for 304 market-rate apartments and 83\naffordable units for seniors\nin a five-story building and a mix of 219 townhomes and triplexes across the site. The affordable units comprise 15 percent of the total project. The development will be executed in partnership with\nLennar\n.\nThe state\u2019s income limits\ndefine\na low-income family of four in Orange County as earning less than $135,350 a year, while a two-person household is considered low-income with less than $108,300 a year.\nThe project aligns with the city\u2019s inclusionary housing program, which requires affordable housing be a part of new developments to help meet the city\u2019s state-mandated\nhousing goals\n. The City of Fountain Valley must plan for 4,839 new units of housing, including 2,093 designated as affordable, by October 2029.\nThe approval didn\u2019t come without pushback from residents, as well as City Council members and the mayor himself, despite the council voting ultimately 4\u20130 in favor of the development. Planning commissioners similarly voted unanimously to approve the project\u2019s entitlements, but the following month, the City Council convened a special meeting to consider appealing the planning commission\u2019s approval, though it ultimately abandoned that effort.\nOne of the sticking points for officials on the fence was the single elevator planned for the five-story building, which is expected to have units for seniors on all floors. \u201cWhat happens if it breaks down?\u201d Mayor Ted Bui said in the July meeting. \u201cHow are people with mobility challenges supposed to evacuate in an emergency? A fire, a gas leak, even a power outage?\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of regulations on cities like ours that come straight from the state,\u201d Bui added. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do better. We still have a responsibility to make sure projects are safe and serve our residents the best they can.\u201d\nCouncilmember Glenn Grandis noted that the development could also increase traffic congestion and affect parking in the area, though he acknowledged the city didn\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on if it decided to combat these kinds of housing developments with the state.\n\u201cUs fighting the state and spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to go fight it makes no sense for the city of\nFountain Valley\n,\u201d Grandis said. \u201cThat would be a poor use of our funds, and quite candidly, we would lose.\u201d\nConstruction timelines for the project have yet to be revealed. City officials will likely have to approve building permits once all the legal and financial agreements are firmed up.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Greystar has struck a deal to slip out of the group of landlords accused in a massive rent collusion case.\nThe South Carolina-based operator agreed to pay $7 million as part of a settlement with nine states, Bisnow\nreported\n. The landlord is also accepting limits on the data it uses to price its massive portfolio to resolve claims from the nine attorneys general.\nThe settlement would remove the company from the states\u2019\nantitrust suit targeting RealPage\u2019s revenue-management software\nand the landlord consortium accused of using it to coordinate pricing. The deal still needs court approval and includes no admission of wrongdoing.\nState prosecutors allege RealPage\u2019s artificial intelligence-powered platform \u2014 formerly YieldStar \u2014 became a shadow hub for landlords to share competitively sensitive data and nudge each other toward higher rents. A\nProPublica report sparked the investigation\n, which evolved into a two-year federal probe followed by a wave of litigation.\nGreystar, which owns or manages more than 900,000 units nationwide, already\nagreed to cooperate\nwith the DOJ in the federal case.\nUnder the multistate settlement, Greystar would be barred from using, soliciting or sharing nonpublic information when setting rents. That covers anything that could signal supply, demand or pricing strategy, including occupancy levels, executed rents, concession data or another landlord\u2019s revenue-management settings.\nThe line between public and proprietary information is spelled out bluntly: if it\u2019s online, it\u2019s fair game, but Greystar cannot ask competitors for details.\nCalifornia would receive the $7 million payment and the nine states would determine how to divide the proceeds amongst the group, which includes North Carolina, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Massachusetts.\nThe deal also installs an antitrust compliance officer and runs for five years with an option to extend if violations surface. If approved, claims against Greystar would be dismissed with prejudice, taking future lawsuits for the same alleged actions off the table.\nRealPage, which declined to comment on a co-defendant\u2019s settlement, has insisted the lawsuits and pending legislation are political theater in an affordability crisis.\nMeanwhile, a parallel class-action case in Nashville continues: Greystar and 26 other operators\nagreed to settle\nand Greystar agreed to pay $50 million, though AGs have urged the judge to reject those deals, arguing the penalties barely dent the alleged harm to tenants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo\u2019s\nbitter battle\nwith Core Club is getting uglier.\nShvo is asking a Manhattan judge for permission to bar the club from stationing its security staff in the lobby of 711 Fifth Avenue to check in guests, a privilege Core Club has enjoyed throughout its escalating legal war with the developer.\nIn a motion filed Thursday, Shvo describes the lobby check-in as a voluntary courtesy that is not written into the lease. \u201cIt is indisputable that the lease does not provide [Core Club] any right to that special treatment,\u201d Shvo argues in court documents.\nShvo served Core Club a notice earlier this month that it was ending the \u201cspecial accommodation.\u201d But the club refused to remove its lobby security guards, citing a judge\u2019s order to preserve its rights under the lease, per court documents. The next day, both sides attended a conference on the lobby dispute but a judge refused to act without a formal motion.\nA lawyer for Core Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe filing is the latest twist in a feud that has grown personal for both the developer and the exclusive members-only club, which once pitched itself as a marquee tenant for Shvo\u2019s high-profile office redevelopment of the former Coca-Cola building.\nThe two sides are now locked in overlapping lawsuits on both coasts. Core sued Shvo last year for $600 million, alleging he failed to deliver on lavish buildouts for new club locations, including 711 Fifth, and then used club space for private gatherings that generated unpaid charges. Shvo countered with claims that Core defaulted on its lease at the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco, leaving $178 million on the table. In New York earlier this summer, Shvo moved to evict the club from 711 Fifth.\nSo far, the court has handed Shvo some wins. A judge recently ordered Core to resume paying rent and to service a nearly $1 million loan it had defaulted on. The judge also imposed a freeze on the eviction until the court determines how much back rent is owed, an amount Shvo pegs at $3.5 million.\nIn the meantime, the judge ordered both sides to \u201clive by the letter of the lease,\u201d according to court documents.\nCore is appealing the loan ruling and has launched a fresh lawsuit accusing Shvo of letting the Fifth Avenue space fall into \u201cshockingly poor\u201d condition, even alleging he diverted money meant for upgrades to his personal yacht (the latest motion was filed as part of this case). Shvo\u2019s camp has dismissed those claims as a distraction.\nIt\u2019s been a difficult year for Shvo. The Israeli-born luxury developer made a\ndramatic exit from a trophy Miami project\nand continues\nfending off lawsuits\nat a number of his developments.\nMost recently, Core Club, its CEO Jennie Enterprise and two condo owners at Shvo\u2019s 685 Fifth Avenue condo development filed a lawsuit accusing Shvo and a German state-backed pension fund of steering investors and buyers into multimillion-dollar deals, then diverting the proceeds to enrich themselves and fund lavish lifestyles.\n",

Retail leasing was down 17 percent year-over-year across the metro, according to\nMatthews Real Estate Services\n. But submarkets like North DuPage and Schaumburg outperformed the rest of the metro, boasting 2 percent annual rent growth in the third quarter.\nChicago-based Core Acquisitions bought a Whole Foods-anchored shopping center at 2900 South Waukegan Road for $44 million, or $102 per square foot, in the northern suburb of Deerfield. The seller was DWS Asset Management. Other tenants at the 430,000 square foot property include Lowes and REI.\nOut west in Naperville, Charlotte-based Barings bought a 149,200-square-foot Jewel Osco-anchored shopping center for $54 million from Buffalo Grove-based Shorewood Development. Barings took out a $27 million mortgage from Principal Asset Management to fund the deal. The price works out to $181 per square foot.\nShorewood bought that shopping center, at 1201-1316 South Naper Boulevard, in 2021 for $25.5 million and renovated it. It\u2019s unclear how much Shorewood invested in the renovations.\nThe third deal to round out the trio was in the western suburbs. Arkansas-based Core Equity Partners bought Wind Point Shopping Center in Batavia for $25 million, or $91 per square foot, from retail specialist PMAT Companies.\nThe 274,000 square foot shopping center, at 201-491 North Randall Road, last sold for $20.5 million in 2023. Its prior owner was Kimco Realty.\u00a0Meanwhile, Chicago\u2019s\nsuburban multifamily market is in the national spotlight.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage Interra Realty found. Some of the outer-ring suburbs in Will and Kendall counties are beginning to see a boost as activity spans farther from the urban core.",

It\u2019s a combination of two units in the co-op at 209 East Lakeshore Drive. Farley bought one 6,000-square-foot unit in 1986 and combined it with another 6,000-square-foot unit six years later.\nFarley, a longtime Chicago financier and businessman, was CEO of Fruit of the Loom until 1999 and a\nonetime co-owner\nof the Chicago White Sox. He now runs private equity firm Liam Ventures.\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe represented the seller, and Katherine Malkin, also of Compass, represented the buyer. Lowe and Malkin declined to share details about the buyer, and public records that could identify the buyer are not yet available.\nThe\nhome was listed\nin August 2023 asking nearly $16 million. It went through several price cuts over the next two years, settling at $7.9 for its final asking price. Condos downtown have struggled to sell at the prices they were trading for a few years ago, as buyer interest has shifted to the North Side neighborhoods and the suburbs.\n\u201cAs soon as we got to our last asking price, we went under contract pretty quickly,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s just a matter of getting to that right price.\u201d\nLowe said he\u2019s seen\nbigger deals\nin the\ndowntown market\nrecently that show buyer interest is starting to pick up again. But units need to be priced to match the market in order to move.\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve probably found the bottom in the downtown market,\u201d he said. \u201cInventory levels across the board are generally starting to decrease a little bit. \u2029And realistic sellers are finding buyers, but you just have to be a realistic seller.\u201d\nThe apartment has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as a home gym, an office, a media room and a library.\nOverlooking Lake Michigan, the 1925 building is potentially \u201cthe most iconic co-op building in the city,\u201d Lowe said. Farley\u2019s residence was one of two in the building that had combined multiple units.\nFarley and his wife, Shelley, are maintaining a residence in Chicago, Lowe said.\nOther big deals downtown this year have included several sales at 9 West Walton, a penthouse at 4 Elm Street that sold for $10.1 million, and sales at One Chicago at 14 West Superior Street and the St. Regis tower at 363 East Wacker Drive.\n",

        "content": "A Fulton Market pioneer is planting a new flag just east of its old turf, putting a stake on a century-old loft for its growing headquarters.\nBike-parts maker SRAM teamed up with local developer R2 Companies to overhaul and partly occupy 550 West Randolph Street, a seven-story building that\u2019s been vacant for years but sits in the slipstream between\nFulton Market\u2019\ns boom and the more traditional office core to the east.\nThe joint venture bought the 168,750-square-foot property, first\nreported\nby CoStar. The expected sale price was roughly $14 million, or $83 per square foot, though the number hasn\u2019t surfaced in public records.\nSRAM\nwill take about half the building for its global headquarters, with\nR2\nsteering the redevelopment toward a 2027 completion.\nSram will exit 1KFulton, at 1000 West Fulton, deepening uncertainty in\nFulton Market\nfor Massachusetts-based landlord Office Properties Income Trust, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month and is facing major tenancy losses.\nThe move gives SRAM something most tenants aren\u2019t in this market: equity in its own future. It\u2019s a twist on current office-market math, where investors are chasing distressed pricing and tenants are upgrading space to bolster in-person work. Here, the tenant becomes part-owner.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison said the deal offers the security of a built-in anchor lease and shared upside. He said R2 and SRAM are aligned culturally and financially on the project\u2019s vision.\nThe seller,\nW.P. Carey\n, offloaded the building after roughly 35 years as part of a global office liquidation and pivot toward industrial assets. Before hiring Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers to run the sale, the New York firm had pitched the site as ripe for expansion.\nR2 and SRAM instead will stick with the 1909 structure, adding new interiors but keeping the original floors. Some space is slated to be delivered as soon as next summer, with the full overhaul expected by summer 2027. Amenities will include a gym, conference center, lounge, rooftop deck and surface parking, plus quick access to restaurants.\nSRAM won\u2019t settle for vanilla office space. Its buildout will mirror \u2014 and expand on \u2014 its 1KFulton digs, which famously feature a test track and fan hub for Tour de France season. The company plans another track at Randolph, along with design, testing, sales, service and machine-shop functions. About 250 employees, plus staff from the nonprofit World Bicycle Relief, will make the move.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Tesla\u2019s sprawling\ngigafactory\neast of Austin has delivered billions in investment and thousands of jobs to the region, but Travis County isn\u2019t ready to hand over the tax breaks that helped lure the EV giant just yet.\nThe county is holding back roughly $14 million in annual property tax rebates after a standoff over what Tesla has \u2014 and hasn\u2019t \u2014 disclosed under its 2020 incentives agreement, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nTesla\nhas paid nearly $19 million in county property taxes since 2021 and could be eligible for rebates of up to 80 percent based on its reported investment.\nBut the county hasn\u2019t returned a dime, saying it cannot verify whether Tesla is meeting key benchmarks tied to the deal. Travis County spokesperson Hector Nieto said officials are conducting a \u201ccareful contract compliance review\u201d and are reserving Tesla\u2019s tax payments until the issue is resolved.\nThe friction stems from employment data. The 20-year incentive agreement caps the percentage of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers \u2014 contractors and temporary staff \u2014 Tesla can count toward its job totals. For the first decade, just 30 percent of qualifying full-time roles can be held by contingent workers.\nTesla, however, hasn\u2019t been reporting how many of its people at the gigafactory are direct employees versus contractors. Instead, it has cited \u201ctotal employees in the\ngreater Austin area\n,\u201d a number that lumps together staff from across the metro, including large operations in Kyle and Williamson County.\nCounty officials say that\u2019s not what the contract requires.\n\u201cI only care about that\nfactory site\n,\u201d Travis County economic development director Christy Moffett told the outlet earlier this year.\nThe distinction matters. Tesla only needed 5,001 full-time gigafactory jobs by the end of last year. Instead, it reported more than 21,000\n\u201cgreater Austin area\u201d\nemployees. On the investment side, it has already spent nearly $5.8 billion \u2014 far exceeding the $1.1 billion required during the first five years.\nAnalysts say Tesla\u2019s hesitation to provide granular headcount details may be strategic. According to Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives, specifics on direct and contract labor could help competitors \u201cback engineer\u201d how the gigafactory operates. Ives suggested to the outlet that the firm doesn\u2019t want to show its playbook.\nCounty commissioners have discussed the issue in executive session but made no decisions.\nNeither side appears eager for a prolonged fight. Tesla is Austin\u2019s largest tech employer and a cornerstone of the region\u2019s growth.\n\u201cAustin is extremely important to Tesla\u2019s future,\u201d Ives said, predicting the two sides will ultimately work it out.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Carlyle Group and the Gotham Organization notched another victory at the Aire in Lincoln Square with a fresh round of financing.\nNatixis provided a $260 million floating-rate loan to refinance the luxury rental building at 200 West 67th Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The refinancing will go toward apartment renovations, as well as updates to the fitness center and a terrace on the fourth floor with grills, a bar and a firepit.\nCBRE\u2019s Lawrence Britvan and Michael Straw arranged the transaction.\nPreviously, Carlyle and Gotham landed a\n$216 million bridge loan\nfrom MF1 Capital associated with their acquisition of the building. They bought the property early last year from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty\nfor $265 million\n.\nGotham and Carlyle bought the 43-story, 310-unit luxury building for roughly $855,000 per unit. One-bedroom units rent for upwards of $5,000 monthly, but rental income only covered 87 percent of borrowing costs for the previous owner, despite near-full occupancy at the end of 2022, according to Moody\u2019s.\nOccupancy appears to remain strong as there are only six availabilities listed on the property website.\nA $194 million mortgage on the property matured in November 2023. That was one of several issues hampering Albert Kalimian\u2019s stewardship of the property. The expiration of a 10-year tax abatement further exacerbated things, causing the annual property tax bill to spike to $6.6 million.\nKalimian ultimately defaulted on that mortgage, prompting the sale process of the luxury building, which boasts amenities such as on-site parking, a children\u2019s playroom and a yoga room.\nKalimian acquired the property from the Red Cross for $72.3 million in 2004, opening the rental building six years later. There are also retail units at the property, including a Polestar electric car dealership.\nCarlyle was in the news earlier this week when it sold a 12-story, 105-unit apartment building in Dumbo to Hubb Properties\nfor $85 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "13th Floor Investments and Key International scored a $79.2 million construction loan for a 327-unit apartment complex in Delray Beach.\nThe financing comes amid continued lending for new rental projects in South Florida, despite a multifamily supply overhang in the tri-county region.\nCoconut Grove-based 13th Floor and Brickell-based Key International started construction of the Skye complex at 2100 South Congress Avenue within their 50-acre Parks at Delray mixed-use project, according to the developers\u2019 news release and a spokesperson. Boca Raton-based CDS International Holdings and Wexford Capital, with offices in West Palm Beach and Greenwich, Connecticut, are project partners.\nCIBC Bank USA is the lender, the release says.\nDesigned by MSA Architects, Skye will consist of studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, ranging from 560 square feet to 1,410 square feet. It also will have three-bedroom rental townhomes ranging from 1,670 square feet to 1,770 square feet.\nConstruction is expected to be completed in 2027, according to the release.\nThe master-planned Parks at Delray is on the southwest corner of South Congress Avenue and Old Germantown Road. Last month, the developers scored a\n$139 million\nrefinancing for the Parks at Delray\u2019s first phase consisting of the 420-unit Savio apartment complex. Savio is leased up, the release says. CIBC also was the lender on the refinancing.\nParks at Delray also will include commercial space, such as retail and dining, and a 1.5-acre park, media reports say. The developers paid\n$33 million\n, combined, for the entire development assemblage in late 2018, according to records.\nLed by Arnaud Karsenti, 13th Floor was founded in 2008. After developing some of Miami-Dade County\u2019s condo towers, the firm has focused on multifamily in recent years, including projects through public-private partnerships.\n13th Floor and Barings are developing the 432-unit\nCadence\napartment tower at the Link at Douglas mixed-use project adjacent to the Douglas Road Metrorail Station in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. 13th Floor is leasing the Link at Douglas site from Miami-Dade County.\nThe Ardid family\u2019s Key International was started by patriarch Jose Ardid, and his sons, Inigo and Diego, now lead operations. The firm has a portfolio of more than 6,000 condos and apartments, and $2 billion of hospitality assets under management with more than 3,000 hotel keys, plus commercial investments. Its hotels include Eden Roc and Marriott Stanton Resort in Miami Beach, and it also developed the Ivy and Mint condos in downtown Miami.\nKey International and 13th Floor have been frequent partners, including on North Miami Beach\u2019s The Harbor and Miami\u2019s 1010 Brickell. In Miami\u2019s Brickell, they plan a 74-story,\nNobu-branded\ncondo tower with 300 units behind the\nFirst Miami Presbyterian Church\nat 609 Brickell Avenue.\nAcross South Florida, lease-ups at multifamily properties have slowed and concessions increased after a construction flurry in recent years. Developers completed a record 18,600 apartments last year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group. In the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, construction started on\n14,515 apartments\nin South Florida, according to data from CoStar.\nDevelopers starting new projects argue that demand will catch up by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027 and 2028. Property managers leasing the new buildings argue the continuing construction flurry will intensify a leasing slowdown.\nIn June, Oak Row Equities scored a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 324-unit 2900 Terrace apartment tower on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nIn Margate, Trammell Crow landed\n$66.4 million\nin August to build a 338-unit apartment complex at\u00a0 785-795 South State Road 7.\n",

The Boston-based construction firm has separately sued the ownership entity in Santa Clara County Superior Court.

City officials hoped it would be a fresh spark for a downtown still struggling to revive foot traffic after the pandemic. Instead, The Fay is another distressed asset in a market where office vacancies have drained daytime activity from San Jose\u2019s core and softened investor appetite for development.\nMadison Realty\nmoved to foreclose\non the property last month; the building could hit the auction block by the end of this year.

        "content": "A major Central Asian developer is making its Houston debut with a boutique townhome community near the Galleria.\nBI Group\n, the North American arm of Kazakhstan\u2019s BI Group, is partnering with local firm Vita Group to build The Winford, a 26-unit for-sale townhome project at 5821 Winsome Lane, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe development marks BI Group\u2019s first step into Texas after launching two projects in Miami. CEO Olzhas Ayazbayev said Houston buyers are looking for \u201cprivacy, space and style\u201d without sacrificing proximity, a gap he argues The Winford fills.\nUnits will run from 2,800 to 3,400 square feet and price between $815,000 and $985,000, about $290 per square foot.\nDesigned with European influences, the four-story homes will feature open layouts, oversized windows, high ceilings and rooftop terraces to maximize natural light. Plans call for three to four bedrooms, attached two-car garages and elevator-ready construction. BI Group is pitching the project as adaptable for multigenerational households, remote workers and buyers seeking indoor-outdoor living. Completion is slated for late next year.\nBased in Asana, the capital of Kazakhstan, BI Group is a heavyweight abroad, with more than 400 residential developments totaling over 100,000 units across eight countries since 1995.\nIts U.S. expansion has so far centered on Miami\u2019s Brickell district, where it is developing two projects including Parkside, an eight-story, 187-unit building. Ayazbayev has said\nBrickell\noffered a competitive edge with units in the $500,000 range; Houston appears to be the firm\u2019s next stateside proving ground.\nThe Winford joins an increasingly active pipeline for the Uptown/Galleria area. In the northern Tanglewood area,\nThe Beverly\n\u2014 a $25 million, seven-story condo building at 5010 Longmont Drive \u2014 topped out last month and is expected to deliver early next year.

        "content": "A rare stretch of Cutchogue acreage is hitting the market with a price that aims to capture the North Fork\u2019s fast-rising luxury curve.\nLongtime East End broker and investor Judi Desiderio is preparing to list an 88-acre site running from Oregon Road to the Long Island Sound for $23 million, Newsday\nreported\n. She\u2019s positioning the approved subdivision for buyers seeking large estates, farmland or both.\nDesiderio told the outlet that she\u2019s soliciting offers before deciding whether to cash out or build the homes herself after a 7-and-a-half year approval slog. The plan carves the land into eight residential lots and more than 60 acres of protected farmland.\nThree of the parcels are 5-acre waterfront sites, four are 2-and-a-half acre lots with deeded water access and one is a 2-acre piece that includes a barn. The farmland is already spoken for: DeLea Sod Farm leases the eastern acreage and\nWolffer Estate Vineyard\nworks the western side.\nTown officials say Desiderio\u2019s low-density layout fits their long-range map for concentrating housing in downtown nodes and keeping farmland intact. Civic groups echoed that stance, framing the preserved acreage as a buffer against sprawl and, in Cutchogue\u2019s case, against light pollution.\nThe pitch arrives as the North Fork\u2019s luxury market continues its climb.\nMedian home prices cracked $1 million earlier this year, more than doubling since 2015, according to data from appraiser Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. Desiderio argued the waterfront pieces would trade for triple the price in East Hampton, suggesting further headroom for high-end buyers who have increasingly migrated north from the South Fork.\nDemand seems to support that view. A 7,500-square-foot bayfront home in Cutchogue notched a\nrecord $11.2 million\nsale last month, reinforcing the area\u2019s shift from farm country to estate territory.\nDesiderio said any homes on her subdivision would likely start around 4,500 square feet.\nStill, the pricing trajectory has fueled local tension over affordability. More than half of North Fork homes now sell for at least $1 million, pushing out year-round workers and sharpening calls for subsidized housing. Southold Town has leaned on a 0.5 percent transfer tax to build its Community Housing Fund and is planning more incentives to preserve affordability.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Rooms To Go paid $17.9 million above the previous sale price 27 years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Lawrence, New York-based Light Properties, paid $12 million for the 3.8-acre site in 1998, records show. Completed in 1996, the vacant buildings were previously leased to Michaels and Barnes &amp; Noble.\nMiami-Dade County approved plans filed by Rooms To Go in January to replace the two buildings with a 51,662-square-foot store. The new building would be one of the furniture retailer\u2019s new superstores that will also have Rooms To Go Kids and Rooms To Go Patio, Weitzner said. Typical Rooms To Go stores are roughly 40,000 square feet.\nThe company expects to break ground next year and anticipates opening the new store in 2027, Weitzner added. Founded in 1990, Rooms To Go has more than 150 stores in 10 states, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nSouth Florida\u2019s retail market has experienced a handful of big box store trades this year. In January, Raanan Katz\u2019s Sunny Isles Beach-based RK Centers picked up a single-story facility in Pembroke Pines for\n$15.2 million\n. The seller, City Furniture, signed a long-term lease to remain in the building.\nIn June, Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group, led by David Simon, bought a ground lease for a big box store at Dadeland Mall leased to JCPenney for\n$15.6 million\n. Simon also owns the Kendall shopping center. The same month, the firm acquired a shuttered Sears store for\n$23 million\n. The building is within Simon\u2019s Town Center at Boca Raton in Palm Beach County.\nAlso in June, EOS Wellness Real Estate Miami LLC paid\n$28.5 million\nfor a vacant retail building previously leased to Office Depot in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour neighborhood.",

The seller was Menlo Equities, acting through affiliates. The square footage and megawatts weren\u2019t reported.\nThe deal included $55 million for the data center at 4650 Old Ironsides Drive, and $42 million for 4700 Old Ironsides Drive, adjacent buildings next to Levi\u2019s Stadium.\nThe purchase comes a month after Centersquare announced it\nspent $1 billion to buy 10 data centers\nacross North America, bringing its portfolio to 80 properties. Centersquare did not disclose whether the Santa Clara data centers were part of that transaction.\nData centers have become a hot commodity as the AI boom takes off, especially in the Bay Area. San Jose and the South Bay, including Santa Clara, are seen as prime real estate to beef up data center operations. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, based in Oakland, has been eyeing the South Bay to\nincrease its capacity to deliver more electricity\nto data centers, which are known for gobbling up power and drinking water.\nTwo other data center developments in Santa Clara have been awaiting use due to a lack of power.\nDigital Realty Trust and Stack Infrastructure, two global heavyweights in the sector, have multimillion-square-foot\ndata centers in Santa Clara that are collecting dust\nbecause city-owned utility Silicon Valley Power doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to deliver enough electricity to turn on the power. Digital Realty applied to build its 430,000-square-foot facility back in 2019; Stack completed its 551,000-square-foot data center in 2021. Blue Owl Capital, which acquired Stack earlier this year, also has a vacant 48-megawatt facility nearby.\nElsewhere in Santa Clara County, last month, a Goodman Group affiliate\npurchased a site in north San Jose\nproposed for a data center. The 46.8 acres at 350 and 370 West Trimble Road are largely vacant, though a partially occupied office complex is nearby.\nThe city of Santa Clara has nearly 60 active or under-construction data centers, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project\u2019s housing capacity has been beefed up from nine units to 84.\nThe project was first introduced in 2021 and called for nine units on the 0.1-acre site; the number doubled to 18 in 2023. Earlier this year, Team Projects principal Zachary Heineman, the applicant on the project, was able to increase it to 84 units using the state\u2019s density bonus.\nThe firm chose to increase the number of units to improve the financial feasibility of the project in response to state density bonus legislation, Heineman told the outlet.\nTo comply with the\nincentive\n, the development will include 17 units of affordable housing, seven for very-low-income households and 10 for moderate-income households. Team Projects hopes to break ground next year.\nIt will partially use modular construction, assembling prebuilt bathrooms and some other prefabricated elements to keep as much construction off-site as possible.\n\u201cThe goal is to minimize time on site and leverage factory conditions where workers are safer,\u201d Heineman said. \u201cOur goal is to systematize this scale of construction, so ideally we can do more projects.\u201d\nThe development previously secured by-right approval this fall using S-13 and S-14 zoning designations. S-13 helps developers build affordable housing by permitting taller buildings and eliminating some regulations and limits on the number of housing units allowed. Oakland\u2019s S-14 designation, implemented in 2023, allows streamlined approvals for projects that meet certain standards and minimum density requirements.\nEarlier this year,\nRelated California and East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation\nscored approvals for a 192-unit complex in Oakland\u2019s Jack London Square using the S-14 zoning overlay.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 23-story, 340,000-square-foot office building was expected to cost $120 million, or $353 per square foot. According to a Nov. 2024 filing, Harwood was supposed to start construction on the building in January and complete it by June 2027.\nConstruction hasn\u2019t started; instead, the firm has spent the year\nstruggling to stabilize its existing portfolio\nand eventually started\noffloading its remaining properties to San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG\n,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported.\nHarwood was hit with three building foreclosures this year.\nIt\nnearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January but saved the building, known as Saint Ann Court, with a recapitalization deal.\nHarwood handed back the keys to Harwood No. 4\nin April after allegedly defaulting on an $80 million mortgage tied to the building. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back that 221,000-square-foot property in a $73 million credit bid.\nHarwood lost a second\noffice building to foreclosure\nin November, when it was forced to give up its first development,\nHarwood No. 1\n, at 2651 North Harwood Street.\nJust before handing over the keys to Harwood No. 1, Harwood quietly sold off four of its office properties to TPG, deed records show. The three properties span 892,000 square feet of Uptown office space.\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street, a 10-story, 178,000-square-foot property that was completed in 1996. It\u2019s appraised at $58.3 million.\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), a 26-story, 320,000-square-foot office building that opened in 2009 at 2501 North Harwood Street. It\u2019s valued at $160 million.\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street, a 22-story office property with 167,000 square feet of space. It\u2019s appraised at $83.5 million.\nThe 22-story 227,000-square-foot Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street, was delivered in 2019. It\u2019s valued at $120 million.\nThe sales were recorded in the fall, a few months after\nHarwood tapped Newmark\nto help it find equity partners and debt for the next phase of Harwood District.\nTPG also appears to be financing Harwood\u2019s latest project, Harwood No. 15. It\nprovided a $100 million construction loan\nfor the 23-story, 340,000-square-foot office project planned for 3008 North Harwood Street. A state filing last November showed the project was expected to cost $120 million, with a projected completion date of June 2027.\nHarwood is facing its\nthird office foreclosure\nthis year with Harwood No.1, at 2651 North Harwood Street, heading to the auction block next month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarwood borrowed $37.45 million from First United Bank for the 105,550-square-foot property in 2020. The debt works out to $355 per square foot. The auction is scheduled for Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at the Dallas County Courthouse. It\u2019s possible that Harwood and First United could work out a loan extension to avoid the sale.\nAs its name suggests, Harwood No. 1 was the firm\u2019s first office development, built in 1984 for Rolex. In April, the building was 54.1 percent leased.\n",

That strong demand positions us well to bring new energy and new tenants to these two properties.\u201d\nBank of New York Mellon is financing the deal at 60 percent loan-to-valuation at $140 million, which is the all-in cost for purchasing and upgrading the buildings, according to a source.\nCommercial Observer first reported the purchase.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger negotiated the sale. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Daniel Fromm arranged the financing.\nRahmani and Khalil put the deal under contract in May, and it was well known through the industry that over the following months they were looking to flip the contract. The final deal essentially works as a flip, with Empire staying in with a small equity piece.\nIt\u2019s a deal model that other investors (the most famous being David Werner) use to make quick profits.\nOlmstead said it plans to modernize the properties, including updated amenities and prebuilt suites.\n381 Park Avenue South is 17 stories and 244,000 square feet; 373 Park Avenue South is 12 stories and 112,000 square feet.\n",

The townhouse\u2019s new owner is\n217W20 CRG NY, LLC.\nThe property has more than 9,000 square feet of living space and 1,500 square feet of exterior space. It also has six bedrooms, a garage, an elevator, a rooftop terrace and an aluminum privacy screen. It hit the market two years ago with an asking price of $22.5 million. Serhant\u2019s\nRavi Kantha, Jessica Taylor\nand\nNicole Kats\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA trust tied to entertainment business manager\nAnna DerParseghian\ndropped $6.3 million on a townhouse that appears to be a two-family home at\n216 Carlton Avenue\nin Fort Greene. The seller was\nJane Karr\n, who had owned the brownstone since 2000. The nearly 4,000-square-foot property sits about a block from Fort Greene Park. The latest transaction appears to have been off-market.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Dumbo,\nJoanna Lau\nand\nJeff Qiu\nscooped up a condo at\n60 Front Street\n, known as the Olympia Dumbo, which was developed by\nFortis Property Group\n. The price was $6.2 million. The three-bedroom pad measures about 2,600 square feet, pricing the transaction at roughly $2,400 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Melanie Courbet\n, founder of the gallery Atelier Courbet and the widow of art dealer Paul Kasmin, paid $3.8 million for a co-op at\n53 Crosby Street\nin Soho. The seller was a trust. The two-bedroom pad, a triplex, measures 4,200 square feet. It went up for sale in March with an asking price of $3.9 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nRoxana Dorneanu\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Robert Buxton\nsold a co-op in Soho to\nRobert Schuham\nfor $3.6 million. Buxton had purchased the unit at\n45 Crosby Street\nin 2018 for just under $4 million. The one-bedroom unit measures 2,100 square feet. The deal pencils out to just over $1,700 per square foot. Compass\u2019\nEdward Hickey, Elise Gold Flangos\nand\nChristina Visca\n. The co-op shareholders own one of the building\u2019s two retail units and earn income from the other store\u2019s lease.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhich state had the greatest yearly spike in residential foreclosures?\nColorado\u2019s residential foreclosure rate surged more than any other state over the past year.\nThe share of homes with foreclosure filings in Colorado spiked more than 145 percent in October compared to the year before.

But you\u2019ll feel smarter.\u201d\nCity Council members sometimes remind me of that fake doctor. Consider the mandates they are proposing to \u201cincrease housing affordability for low-income New Yorkers and families,\u201d according to a press release.\nThe mandates would actually throw a monkey wrench into the complex machinery of affordable housing development.\nThe \u201cproblem\u201d they are trying to fix is that the share of studios in affordable housing projects increased to 34 percent from 29 percent between 2015 and 2024, while the share of three-bedroom units dipped below 7 percent.\nThey also don\u2019t like that \u201conly\u201d 43 percent of these homes are for \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d low-income households, given that half of renters in the city are in those categories.\nCouncil leaders have distributed three bills for different members to introduce.\nIntro 1433\nfrom Eric Dinowitz would set a citywide minimum percentage of two- and three-bedroom units in city-funded projects. Crystal Hudson\u2019s\nIntro 1437\nwould cap the share of studios in senior housing projects at 50 percent over five years.\nAnd\nIntro 1443\nfrom Sandy Nurse would require that a citywide minimum percentage of city-funded rental units must be affordable for extremely and very low-income households.\nThe Council thinks the way to change the outcomes of a complex system is to simply mandate new outcomes. At the very least, it should have asked the state\u2019s leading affordable housing group for advice.\nThe current system, NYSAFAH chair Samantha Magistro testified, \u201cadapts to periodic funding constraints, changes in federal policy, specific site conditions and market realities to make projects feasible.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cBy replacing this flexible system with rigid, citywide mandates, these bills will fundamentally alter the evaluation and financing of projects.\u201d\n\u201cThe proposed legislative package will lock in mandates that cannot adapt to varying site conditions, neighborhood contexts and financial realities, making many projects simply unfeasible.\u201d\nBecause of term limits, the business community needs to educate 51 new City Council members every eight years. We\u2019re now at the end of an election cycle, so most Council members should be experienced enough not to do stupid stuff.\nYet they persist.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhen will Zohran Mamdani propose property tax reform for New York City? Bill de Blasio\u2019s tax reform commission didn\u2019t come out with\na plan\nuntil the final year of his mayoralty \u2014 too late for him to get Albany to consider it, let alone pass it. That was probably by design. Mamdani did not blame de Blasio for that, but did criticize Eric Adams for failing to propose reforms after promising to do so\nwithin 100 days\nof taking office. Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Under a\nnew law\n, limited liability companies formed in New York before Jan. 1, 2026, will have a year to disclose information about their beneficial owners to the state. Companies formed after that date will have 30 days. Unfortunately for journalists, the state will not make that information public.\nElsewhere\u2026\nFoot traffic at New York City offices, as measured by cellphone activity, rose 4.8 percent in the 12 months through October, but remains 16.2 percent below its October 2019 level.\nHowever, that six-year drop places New York\u2019s pandemic recovery at second best among major cities, according to\nPlacer.ai\n. Only Miami was better, down 10.2 percent from October 2019.\nThe weakest recovery has been in Chicago, where office traffic is down 42.9 percent. San Francisco was similarly bad, down 42.1 percent. But San Francisco\u2019s number has improved the most in the past year, up 11.8 percent, just above Miami\u2019s 11.3.\nThe data also show slow office-traffic recoveries in Boston, Denver, Washington and Los Angeles. Nationally, 48 percent of office activity is on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$11.6 million\nfor a 9,132-square-foot townhouse at 217 West 20th Street in Chelsea. Ravi Kantha and Jessica Taylor with Serhant had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was for\n$3.2 million\nfor a 5,368-square-foot auto-repair shop at 70-16 51st Avenue in Woodside.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$22.5 million\nfor a 4,445-square-foot condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. The Singer Team at Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Although office leasing has boomed in Miami\u2019s Brickell and downtown West Palm Beach, older office buildings have felt the sting from remote work.\nChicago-based Bridge plans the Bridge Point Doral 826 project with a pair of warehouses spanning 268,700 square feet, combined, on the 16-acre site at 7775 Northwest 48th Street, according to the developer\u2019s news release. The firm is working on site preparations, and the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2027.\nBridge, led by Steve Poulos, with Kevin Carroll leasing the Southeast region, paid\n$45.4 million\nfor the site last year. The selling entity, managed by Richard and Warren Zinn in Miami, had paid $7.8 million for Corporate Park of Doral in 2010, records show.\nThe existing complex, called Corporate Park of Doral, consists of eight buildings spanning a combined 192,800 square feet. It was completed in the 1970s, according to LoopNet.\nBridge is a prolific South Florida industrial developer with 11 million square feet of completed and planned projects in the tri-county region, the release says.\nThis marks Bridge\u2019s second office-to-industrial project in Miami-Dade County. Last year, the firm scored a\n$53 million\nconstruction loan to develop the 326,400-square-foot Bridge Point Flagler Station with two warehouses on the site of Ryder Systems\u2019 former headquarters at 11690 Northwest 105th Street in an unincorporated area of the county. Ryder, a homegrown logistics giant that had been based at the property since 2005, moved to a smaller headquarters in Coral Gables, citing the need for less office space due to hybrid work.\nNear Doral, Nashville-based Hamilton Development plans to tear down the Flagler Station office buildings at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, and replace them with over\n300,000 square feet\nof industrial space in two facilities.\nElsewhere, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, Toledano family\u2019s BH Group and Pebb Enterprises plan to redevelop one of the office buildings at 6600 North Military Trail in Boca Raton into a\n500-unit apartment building\n. The other two office buildings at the Office Depot campus will remain intact.\nNear Dadeland Mall, Keystone Development + Investment is working on creating\n212 apartments\nat the office buildings at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard and 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in Miami-Dade\u2019s Kendall neighborhood.\n",

        "content": "A\nWicker Park mansion\nmay end up being a loser for Chicago entrepreneur Don Wilson Jr. after recent price cuts.\nThe 8,250-square-foot estate at 1407 North Hoyne Avenue has been on the market since July 2023, when it was listed for $7 million. The asking price has fallen three times since then: It dropped to $6.5 million in November 2023, then $6 million in July 2024, and finally dropped to $5 million Oct. 29 this year.\nThe red brick Victorian mansion was originally built for beer baron John H. Raap. It is part of a popular walking tour in\nWicker Park\ncalled Beer Baron Row. The home has five beds and seven bathrooms, along with offices, an exercise room, a wine room and other amenities.\nWilson\n, the CEO and founder of trading firm DRW Holdings as well as real estate firm Convexity Properties, bought the mansion for $4.8 million in 2021. He purchased an adjacent coach house for $1.5 million shortly after.\nIt\u2019s not clear from the property listing if the asking price is for both the main building and the coach house. The 1,500-square-foot coach house is on a separate lot with a Schiller Street address, and it\u2019s not listed for sale on public channels. The Hoyne Avenue listing only gives details about the main house.\nThe $5 million asking price adds up to a loss on the $6.3 million Wilson paid for both properties. If the price is for the Hoyne Avenue mansion only, Wilson would still likely take a loss after paying agent commissions and other fees.\nWilson planned to renovate the buildings, including connecting the two properties, after purchasing. He went before the Wicker Park Committee community group and the Commission on Chicago Landmarks with his plans, but it does not appear the changes were made.\nTim Salm, the Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent representing Wilson, did not return a request for comment.\nThe initial $7 million asking price was higher than any Wicker Park home had sold for before or since the listing debuted. The neighborhood record was set last November when an 8,000-square-foot mansion on North Wood Street sold for $5.3 million.\n",

        "content": "Another century-old Randolph Street loft is poised for a reboot, this time driven by a construction heavyweight looking to consolidate its Chicago footprint.\nInvestors tied to design-build firm\nARCO/Murray\nare under contract to buy the seven-story, 123,800-square-foot office building at 549 West Randolph Street for about $14 million, or $113 per square foot, according to people familiar with the deal, Costar\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s a steep discount from its pre-pandemic valuation and the latest sign of owner-users stepping into a battered office market.\nARCO/Murray\nalready occupies roughly 8,500 square feet in the building, but the firm plans to expand to multiple floors over the next several years. The move would pull together staff now scattered across River North\u2019s 311 West Huron Street and 500 West Monroe Street in the Loop. The strategy mirrors a transaction completed this week across the street at 550 West Randolph, where developer\nR2 and bike-parts maker SRAM teamed up\nto buy a similar loft for $14 million, with SRAM slated to occupy half the building.\nThe building at 549 Randolph, completed in 1909, is 39 percent vacant and has had a tumultuous run since its last sale.\nLocal investors bought it for $34.95 million in 2019, backed by a $29.8 million loan from\nHeitman\n, only to hand the keys back via a deed in lieu of foreclosure in late 2022. Office values across the city \u2014 particularly for older, non-trophy assets \u2014 have cratered since the pandemic, leaving landlords squeezed by rising rates, weak leasing and maturing debt.\nNeither\nARCO/Murray\nnor Heitman commented to the outlet on the pending deal.\nARCO/Murray, based in Downers Grove, a far-west Chicago suburb, and affiliated with national builder ARCO, has worked on everything from industrial boxes to Topgolf venues. Investors tied to the company also picked up a Downers Grove office building in 2022 for $3.15 million, signaling an appetite for strategic real estate plays as part of its broader growth.\nThe Randolph corridor, sitting at the hinge between Fulton Market\u2019s boom and the Loop\u2019s slower grind, has increasingly drawn firms willing to own rather than lease. Transit access is a major part of the pitch: the building sits near Metra and CTA lines and offers an easy jump to suburban expressways \u2014 a logical fit for a company with a large suburban workforce.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wan Bridge is taking its built-to-rent playbook to the San Antonio area for the first time, planting a major flag in New Braunfels with a 200-plus-unit community.\nThe Houston-based developer started construction on West End Estates, a gated build-to-rent project at 901 Beebrush Lane, expected to cost about $60 million, in the ballpark of $300,000 per unit. Wan Bridge framed the launch as another step in its push to elevate Texas\u2019 rental housing, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nCEO Ting Qiao said the firm aims to \u201credefine what it means to rent in Texas,\u201d leaning on a model that blends single-family amenities with the convenience of professional maintenance. The company handles landscaping, exterior upkeep and routine repairs across its communities \u2014 a pitch that\u2019s helped it become one of the state\u2019s most active BTR players.\nThe San Antonio submarket townhomes are part of an ambitious plan Qiao announced five years prior to construct\n30,000 build-to-rent units\nin 50 Texas markets by 2026, including 1,000 units in Land Tejas/Starwood Land communities in Houston. Challenges related to costs, supply shortages and utilities hindered home production, however, delaying some projects.\nWan Bridge also announced plans earlier this year for rental communities in North Texas in\npartnership\nwith\nCenturion American Development Group\n.\nWest End Estates will offer two-story townhomes ranging from 1,200 to 1,800 square feet, with two-, three- and four-bedroom floor plans, attached two-car garages, private backyards and rents between $1,900 and $2,520.\nThe design mirrors the developer\u2019s standard product: suburban-scale homes built specifically for long-term renters, with finishes and layouts intended to compete with entry-level ownership.\nAmenities include a pool, sports courts, a walking trail and a playground within the gated site. The first homes are expected to come online early next year.\nThe move into New Braunfels gives\nWan Bridge\na foothold in one of the state\u2019s fastest-growing corridors between Austin and San Antonio.\nThe\nrental community sector\nhas exploded across Texas over the past five years, fueled by migration, high mortgage rates and a glut of renters seeking more space without the financial commitment of buying. Wan Bridge has leaned into that demand, building a vertically integrated platform that spans development, construction and property management.\nDevelopers see strong demographics and persistent affordability challenges as durable tailwinds, and the San Antonio market has begun drawing attention from developers who cut their teeth in Houston and Dallas, such as Wan Bridge.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s plan for a water park at his Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort is caught in a tidal wave of opposition.\nAt a Tuesday meeting of the Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board, neighboring residents, city activists and board members slammed the proposal to redevelop the 1,504-room oceanfront hotel\u2019s outdoor pool area into a family-oriented attraction that would include a\n12-story waterslide structure\n.\nIn a statement, Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\nsaid the waterpark is an \u201copportunity to properly activate its iconic and internationally-known hotel brand to strengthen community opportunities and be part of the solution that fortifies the city\u2019s future.\u201d\n\u201cWe remain committed to ongoing conversations with area neighbors, stakeholders, and city leaders to ensure the plan aligns with all guidelines while also honoring the character of the historic property,\u201d the statement said.\nThe board delayed a vote until Jan. 13 on whether to approve 11 variances sought by the affiliate of Fontainebleau Development that owns the 22-acre historic landmark at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n.\nThe variances would allow the hotelier to build \u201c11 waterslides, a kid\u2019s play pool, refurbished and new bathrooms, cabanas and associated supporting spaces,\u201d according to a Sept. 11 letter of intent filed with the city of Miami Beach. Renderings show the waterslides are connected to the 12-story structure.\nDuring the two-hour preservation board discussion, Fontainebleau Development\u2019s lobbyist and land use attorney Mickey Marrero told board members that the hotel wants to add a water park to keep up with its competition, such as the Atlantis Paradise Island Bahamas and Baha Mar resorts in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\u201cOur competitors are not small hotels in Miami Beach,\u201d Marrero said. \u201cOur competitors are regional destinations for families and tourists\u2026that are bringing amenities beyond what we have traditionally seen in the past. We need to keep in line with that. It is critical to the future success of the hotel.\u201d\nFollowing Marrero\u2019s presentation, opponents let loose a rip current of criticism about the water park plan being incompatible with the Morris Lapidus-designed hotel and the surrounding Mid-Beach neighborhood, as well as potentially creating more traffic in an already congested area of the city. Nearly three dozen people spoke against the project, compared to one resident who spoke in favor of it.\nSome speakers implored board members to vote against the plan.\n\u201cYou guys are the last line of defense for historic architecture in Miami Beach,\u201d said attorney and Miami Beach resident Mark Weiss. \u201cAnd Lord, we need some saving here today. The Fontainebleau is a landmark, not a theme park.\u201d\nRoger Goldblatt, chairman of the Miami Design Preservation League, and Anamarie Ferreira de Melo, president of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association, also said their organizations oppose the water park.\n\u201cThe waterslide structure would dramatically alter one of Miami Beach\u2019s most iconic properties and set a concerning precedent,\u201d Goldblatt told board members.\nBoard members also offered a dim view of the water park. \u201cIt is just massive,\u201d said board member Randy Hollingsworth of the waterslide tower. \u201cThere is no context for this structure on this site.\u201d\nHis colleague, Mitch Novick, added: \u201cThis is out of context, quite frankly. I don\u2019t find any way to make this compatible with the neighborhood.\u201d\nMarrero said\nFontainebleau Development\nwould meet with opposing residents and neighborhood associations to address their concerns.\n\u201cWe put a lot of time, effort and funding into this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like the opportunity to make adjustments to make it work.\u201d",

        "content": "New York City is taking another swing at Staten Island\u2019s North Shore, trading failed tourism bets for a full-scale neighborhood buildout.\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation and Council member Kamillah Hanks\nunveiled\na sweeping vision to remake\nEmpire Outlets\nand the\nformer New York Wheel site\ninto a mixed-use district anchored by as many as 2,500 new homes. The vision is a major shift for a waterfront defined more by stalled projects than momentum.\nThe plan, shaped through months of community workshops with more than 1,000 residents, moves away from the city\u2019s decade-long pursuit of drawing visitors to St. George. Instead, the focus is on housing across income bands, parkland, cultural programming and retail that will serve locals.\nAccording to NYCEDC, Empire Outlets \u2014 once marketed as a waterfront retail destination but long plagued by tenant churn and inconsistent foot traffic \u2014 would be rezoned alongside the Wheel property to accommodate housing and reinvigorated public space. FXCollaborative renderings show a pedestrian-friendly waterfront stitched together with lawn space, playgrounds and a rebuilt esplanade.\nThe first step would be ULURP; environmental review is slated for early next year and the formal land-use process would begin later that year. That timeline sets the stage for several more rounds of public input \u2014 and plenty of political scrutiny \u2014 before shovels hit the ground.\nCity officials say they\u2019re responding directly to resident demands for reliable public access, youth-oriented programming, community space and better transit links.\nA redesigned NYC Ferry route, expected by the end of the year, would connect St. George to Brooklyn and Wall Street. Other ongoing moves include upgrades at Staten Island University Hospital Community Park, progress on Lighthouse Point\u2019s next phase and the Mary Cali Dalton Recreation Center\u2019s debut next year.\nThe announcement builds on the Adams administration\u2019s North Shore Action Plan, a $400 million initiative launched in 2023 that promised 2,400 homes, 20 acres of open space and thousands of jobs.\nFor Staten Island, the latest proposal marks the city\u2019s next attempt to reclaim two of its most visible waterfront sites after years of false starts.\n",

        "content": "Every mayoral administration leaves office with unfinished business, be it specters of campaign promises gone unfulfilled or ambitious plans approved but not yet enacted.\nSuch loose ends can haunt incoming administrations but can also lay the groundwork for future wins. Others are tossed aside as a new mayor sets their own agenda.\n\u201cIt is a balancing sort of thought process between \u2018how I, as a new administration, can make a big splash, and ensure what I do is feasible,\u2019\u201d said Anita Laremont, a partner at Fried Frank and former director of the Department of City Planning.\nWhen Mayor Eric Adams came to office in 2022, he\npromised\nto cut red tape to make it easier to build in the city. He also pledged to overhaul the city\u2019s property tax system.\nOn the first, his administration created paths for some housing projects to\nskip environmental review\n, approved sweeping zoning changes aimed at \u201cbuilding a little more housing in every single neighborhood\u201d and initiated an overhaul to the city\u2019s land use review process.\nOn the second, Adams joins his predecessors in failing to deliver.\nMayor-elect\nZohran Mamdani has said he wants to pick up that torch. His administration will also need to oversee how some of the zoning changes approved under Adams play out.\nHere are some of the biggest outstanding real estate issues as Adams exits City Hall:\nBig zoning changes\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, approved in\nDecember 2024\n, was the\ncenterpiece\nof the Adams administration\u2019s housing plan. The text amendment eliminated parking requirements for newly constructed housing in certain parts of the city, legalized accessory dwelling units, created a new density bonus for affordable housing, made more office buildings eligible for conversion into housing and included several other changes aimed at making it easier to build housing in the city.\nGiven the breadth of these changes, it will take time to roll them out. For example, the city only just opened applications for homeowners to add ADUs to their properties in September.\nLaremont said developers with existing projects are figuring out how to apply aspects of City of Yes to their projects and whether changes are compatible with certain city programs. She thinks there will need to be a \u201creckoning\u201d between the City Planning, the Department of Buildings and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to ensure that the agencies are implementing the changes uniformly.\nThat will be left to the leaders of these agencies under Mamdani.\nMamdani\u2019s administration will also be tasked with applying the\nhousing ballot measures\napproved by voters in November. The changes will create pathways for certain affordable housing projects to bypass City Council approval. It will also create an appeals board that will be able to reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of projects that would add affordable housing in one borough.\nThe next administration will not only have to navigate the technical aspects of those changes, but the political implications of them as well, including how these measures affect the mayor\u2019s relationship with the next City Council speaker.\nUnder the Adams administration, the City Council approved five neighborhood rezonings, which are projected to add nearly 50,000 new units of housing in the city. Of course, those estimates depend on a number of factors, including construction and labor costs, as well as available public subsidy. The various pledges made under these rezonings \u2014\u00a0such as the nearly $2 billion commitment made by City Hall as part of the Long Island City rezoning \u2014\u00a0will fall to the next administration to carry out.\nPotential zoning changes\nJust before heading out of Gracie Mansion, Adams is expected to leave his successor with blueprints for ramping up housing construction in Manhattan.\nThe so-called\nManhattan Plan\nis slated to be released by the end of the year and include strategies for building 100,000 new housing units in the borough over the next decade. Some already approved initiatives \u2014\u00a0including the\nMidtown South rezoning\nand changes under City of Yes \u2014\u00a0are baked into that estimate. Proposals to build on city-owned sites, including 100 Gold Street, are also included in that count. It isn\u2019t clear what else will be included in the plan, but it could recommend upzoning other parts of Manhattan.\nThat could mean permitting buildings that are more than 12 times larger than the size of the lots they rise from, meaning they have a floor area ratio, or FAR, higher than 12. This has only happened once since the state lifted a cap on residential density in the city last year. The Adams administration mapped higher residential density districts as part of the\nMidtown South rezoning\n, and the city hasn\u2019t yet identified other areas where it will apply the higher residential FARs.\nA spokesperson for City Planning noted that it is not uncommon for planning initiatives to span multiple mayoral administrations.\nLaremont said the Manhattan Plan could serve as a \u201cjumping off point\u201d for the next mayor. \u201cIn most planning things, there are really long-term windows to get things done,\u201d she said.\nBasha Gerhards, executive vice president of public policy at the Real Estate Board of New York, said that sometimes ideas need time to percolate before catching on. A proposal to make it easier to convert office buildings into housing, for instance, was talked about at the end of the de Blasio administration and was picked up by Adams.\n\u201cSometimes these things just take a long time to be socialized,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need to get used to big changes.\u201d\nThe Adams administration is leaving other land-use initiatives and projects on the table.\nTo secure the City Council\u2019s support for another text amendment, the City of Yes for Economic Opportunity, the administration promised to advance a proposal that would require special permits for last-mile facilities spanning 50,000 square feet or more. The proposal hasn\u2019t yet started the city\u2019s review process for text amendments (which is similar to Ulurp).\nThe next mayor will need to decide whether to pursue this change. Abandoning the effort, however, would potentially alienate the City Council. REBNY has opposed the text amendment: Gerhards said, as currently written, the proposal would be an \u201ceconomic killer to the industry.\u201d\nCity Planning also began public engagement this year on a plan to encourage more housing construction in an area surrounding White Plains Road in the Bronx. Any rezoning proposal there will need to be picked up by a future administration.\nThe next mayor may also prioritize certain projects that are already in the works. Mamdani indicated that he wanted to move forward with housing at the Elizabeth Street Garden site, but the Adams administration quietly designated the property a city park. The developers selected to build senior housing on the site\nsued\nthe administration on Wednesday, arguing that the mayor lacks the legal authority to do so.\nThere\u2019s also One45,\na three-building project\napproved for West 145th Street and Lenox Avenue. The developer is willing to increase the project\u2019s affordability levels, but has indicated that public subsidy is necessary to do so.\nEvan Thies, a former Adams advisor, said the lowest-hanging fruit for the next administration is already-approved projects and major rezonings and ensuring those are funded and moving forward.\n\u201cOne point of concern, from the real estate industry, is that if you are too focused on just building city housing, for instance, then you won\u2019t be putting the resources into housing that is low-hanging fruit on the private side,\u201d he said.\nState of rent-stabilized housing\nMamdani told Pix11 in November that his \u201cfirst order of business\u201d once he takes office in January will be to\nfreeze the rent\nfor stabilized tenants, one of his core campaign promises.\nLandlords of these properties have warned that such a move would spell further\ndisaster\nfor this housing stock, which is already seeing rising defaults and foreclosures or trading at deep discounts. Distress has also hit nonprofit owners of stabilized housing. Nonprofit lender Community Preservation Corp.\nreported\nin August that across its rent-stabilized portfolio, the number of foreclosures increased eightfold since 2022, and the delinquency rate more than doubled.\nLandlord groups have pushed for reprieves, including changing the rules around increasing rents on apartments once they become vacant, but state lawmakers have shown little interest in pursuing such legislation.\nThe Rent Guidelines Board under Adams moved away from the rent freezes approved during the de Blasio administration, and approved increases between 2.75 and 3.25 percent for one-year leases. He often emphasized the need to help small landlords keep up with rising costs.\nHPD also\nlaunched a pilot program\nto help landlords pay for repairs, but\nno owners\nhave participated. Landlord groups have argued that the funding was\ninadequate\nfor the level of distress in stabilized buildings.\nMamdani has said that he supports finding ways to reduce costs for owners, including by finding alternative forms of insurance and by reforming the city\u2019s property tax system.\nProperty tax reform and tax breaks\nWhen Adams campaigned for mayor in 2021, he\npromised\nto tackle the city\u2019s \u201cunfair and overly complicated\u201d property tax system during his first year in office.\nThat didn\u2019t happen that year nor the ones that followed, though the administration\nindicated\nearlier this year that it was working on a proposal. So, there is still time for Adams to follow former Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s lead and release a\nplan\nfor reforming the system in his final days in office, though the mayor has never presented a fleshed-out vision for this.\nWhatever happens on that front, the issue will be left to the next mayor to address. Mamdani has said that he supports comprehensive property tax reform, and has even pointed to Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s nearly decade-old lawsuit challenging the system and recommendations made at the end of the de Blasio administration as potential paths forward.\nTENNY has maintained that the city must make changes to how one-, two- and three-family homes, as well as condo and co-ops, are assessed. The group is waiting to see whether a court will force the city\u2019s hand.\nMamdani has also said that he supports extending the\ntax break J-51\n, which expires in June. The latest iteration of the program provides property owners with an abatement equal to as much as 70 percent of the cost of major building renovations over the course of up to 20 years. Landlords have criticized it, however, because eligibility is limited to buildings that are at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or that have received \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nRenewing J-51 would require state action, as would amending the 485x tax exemption. Developers argue that the construction wage requirements for\n485x\nare stunting housing construction. A wage floor kicks in for projects with more than 99 units, and then steeper rates go into effect in certain parts of the city for projects with 150 or more units.\nIt remains to be seen if there will be enough political will to change the program next year, given that Gov. Kathy Hochul is up for reelection and any rollbacks of the wage requirements would alienate the city\u2019s construction unions.\n",

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase is shopping a soured $270 million loan tied to a big West Loop office tower in the latest sign of how deeply distress has seeped into the downtown market.\nThe debt is backed by 500 West Monroe, a 46-story building whose owner,\nSpear Street Capital\n, failed to pay off the mortgage when it matured in January. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the bank hired brokers to market the loan, according to a flyer circulated to investors.\nJLL is pitching the note as a path to take control of the 967,000-square-foot tower through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, a quicker and cleaner alternative to a courtroom slog. The debt amounts to $279 per square foot.\nThe Monroe Street property joins a growing list of Loop offices buckling under the pandemic\u2019s long tail. Remote work eroded demand for big blocks of workspace, and higher interest rates pummeled valuations, leaving many landlords stuck when loans come due.\nThe Illinois Center\ncampus,\n330 North Wabash\nand\n350 North Orleans\nare among the major addresses in some stage of distress.\nLosing the keys would mark a brutal reversal for Spear Street. The San Francisco investor paid $412 million for the tower in October 2019, near the top of the market, and financed the deal with the JPMorgan loan. At the time, the building was 99 percent leased and downtown was on a record-setting run. Less than half a year later, the pandemic hit and the tenant roster began to fray.\nSpear Street tried to steady the ship, investing $21.8 million into upgrades and striking a 10-year lease extension and expansion with Lockton in 2023, but the momentum wasn\u2019t enough to offset the losses.\nThe tower is just over 75 percent leased with an average remaining term of 4.7 years.\nMotorola Solutions put roughly a third of its space on the sublease market in 2022, and Antares Capital decamped for BMO Tower last year.\nAdtalem Global Education and Newmark also plan to exit for newer buildings.\nThere\u2019s no asking price for the note, but comparable deals suggest the tower is worth well below the outstanding loan balance. With downtown asset sales thin and lender takebacks increasingly common, the offering will test investor appetite for a large, aging tower in a market still unmoored from its largess a decade ago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Amazon\nis doubling down in Silicon Valley, developing a last-mile hub just south of downtown San Jose.\nThe e-retail behemoth plans to redevelop a 17.8-acre parcel at 1605 Seventh Street in the Spartan Keyes neighborhood, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The distribution center will span 106,800 square feet.\nAmazon bought the Seventh Street site about five years ago for $59.3 million, or $3.3 million per acre.\nSix industrial buildings, including a 279,000-square-foot structure, will be demolished to make way for the complex. Plans call for roughly 8,700 square feet of office space and about 36,600 square feet of external staging and loading areas.\nIt will employ 600 people for the last stages of package deliveries.\nThe site will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week to support deliveries; an estimated 52 daily truck trips are expected to deliver packages to the site.\nDemolition is slated to begin in July and finish next October. Construction is expected to begin in November of next year and wrap up in October 2027. The project is planned to be fully complete by December 2027.\nThe company hasn\u2019t specified its service radius from the site, but filings suggest the hub will feed a wide stretch of the South Bay including San Jose, Campbell,\nLos Gatos\n, Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz.\nThe distribution center push comes less than a month after the company announced it intends to lay off 14,000 corporate workers, including more than 1,400 in California and more than 600 in the Bay Area, including 391 in\nSunnyvale\n, 176 in Palo Alto and 76 in\nSanta Clara\nfor a total of 643 in the region. The Seattle-based company employs nearly 7,500 people overall in the Bay Area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Miami commissioners voted to approve on first reading a proposal that would allow developers to double their density in specific neighborhoods, starting in Edgewater.\nUnder the proposal, developers would pay $35,000 per unit into a Resilience Trust Fund for the additional density. Those funds would be used to help pay for flood control and climate projects, like raising streets, replacing\nseawalls\nand installing pump stations. Areas identified as \u201chigh demand\u201d and where the density bonus could apply are Edgewater,\nWatson Island\nand the Miami portion of the Venetian Islands.\nThe city commission on Thursday voted in favor of\nthe proposal\n, which requires a second reading vote. Commissioner Damian Pardo is sponsoring the legislation.\nThe current density in Edgewater allows developers to build 150 units per acre, but the city\u2019s comprehensive plan allows developers to build up to 300 units per acre using other loopholes or incentives, such as transferring development rights. Developers also have the option to build under the state\u2019s Live Local Act, which provides density, height, parking and tax incentives to builders that set aside a portion of their units to workforce housing.\n\u201cI want people to understand that that density is already there, that density is there, and we\u2019re putting forward a tool, a mechanism by which someone who chooses to develop can access that density,\u201d Pardo said.\nThe\nLive Local Act\nallows developers to build up to 1,000 units per acre in certain areas.\nCommission chairwoman Christine King was adamant that her district be excluded from the proposal, which it is, and she was critical of legislation like Live Local that provide even more density.\n\u201cWe are, someone said earlier today, the strongest, most popular city. We\u2019re neck and neck with New York and Los Angeles. We act like we\u2019re a small little town of 500 people, and we\u2019re not.\u00a0 We need to stand up for our residents,\u201d she said. \u201cLive Local is atrocious for us. RTZ [Rapid Transit Zoning] is atrocious for us. And the city of Miami, the electorate body, should be able to decide what is best for our community, not someone else.\u201d\nCommissioners agreed to have the city host a public workshop to clear up misinformation and address residents\u2019 concerns.\nUnder the Resilience Trust Fund proposal, money collected by the city would generally have to stay in the same area, and any development that costs more than $100,000 would require commission approval. City officials have targeted Edgewater because the neighborhood is facing infrastructure issues due to major flooding and is experiencing a huge increase in development.\n",

The county previously had a 15-year lease for 70,600 square feet.\nThe expansion will start with\nOrange County Health Care Agency\nmoving into 59,000 square feet in about two years.\nThe deal is Drawbridge\u2019s latest sizable lease this fall in Orange County. Last month, defense contractor\nAnduril signed a lease\nfor the three-building, 190,000-square-foot Hive office campus in Costa Mesa owned by Drawbridge. The San Francisco-based landlord closed a deal that same day to buy the 14-acre Hive office complex at 3333-3337 Susan Street from Invesco Real Estate for $77.9 million.\nThat purchase came after the Costa Mesa Planning Commission recommended approval on a\nproposal from Legacy Partners\nto demolish the three existing two-floor buildings on the site to build 1,050 housing units, including at least 105 affordable units, as well as 336,000 square feet of open space at 3,700 square feet of retail.\nElsewhere in Costa Mesa, Meritage Homes\nbought the former Trinity Broadcasting Network campus\nat 3150 Bear Street for $44.5 million earlier this month. The seller was Manny Khoshbin of the Irvine-based Khoshbin Company, which offloaded the 6-acre property spanning 70,800 square feet of space.

It once supplied electricity to nearby neighborhoods, downtown buildings and the Stockyards\u2019 meatpacking lines. The plant\u2019s twin 265-foot smokestacks have long made it one of the city\u2019s most recognizable \u2014 if increasingly dilapidated \u2014 landmarks.\nThe building fronts the Trinity River Trails, a 100-mile-plus hike-and-bike system.\nInterest is strong despite an appraisal pegging the riverfront site at just $9.42 million, according to the Texas Bid Network.\nTCC bought the plant in 2004 as part of a plan to build a downtown campus. After the financial crisis derailed those ambitions, the community college system bought the former RadioShack headquarters, now home to its Trinity River and Connect Campus, across the West Fork of the Trinity River from the old power plant.\nTCC leaders have pitched the TXU building as a redevelopment play, citing the surge of attention around Panther Island and the possibility of\nhistoric tax incentives\nto help remake the structure.\nChancellor Elva LeBlanc said in October that Panther Island sits \u201cat the center of Fort Worth\u2019s rapid growth and redevelopment,\u201d arguing the property is\nwell-positioned\nalong\nNorth Main Street\nfor a buyer willing to tackle its challenges.\nThose challenges are real. The plant\u2019s structural deterioration has made it an expensive liability for the college and a dangerous draw for trespassers. In April, 27-year-old Estafania Sosa died after falling 50 feet through internal shafts near the hydroelectric portion of the facility \u2014 an incident that amplified pressure on the school to offload the site.\nAs for the value of the real estate, location does the heavy lifting. Roughly 21 people joined a recent walkthrough, though TCC couldn\u2019t confirm how many firms they represented. The turnout was enough for officials to push the bid opening date to Dec. 18 to give investors more time to model the site\u2019s potential.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final sale price isn\u2019t available, but the property was listed for $21 million when it sold last month. It spans over 910 acres on multiple parcels, bringing the price to $23,073 per acre.\nBarry joined the Texas Rangers during the state\u2019s brief period as an independent republic and later served in the Confederacy during the Civil War. He lived at the fork of the Bosque and East Bosque Rivers until he died in 1906 and was buried in a family cemetery on the property.\nThe ranch also hosted veteran and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d author Chris Kyle, who competed in bronc riding during his time at Tarleton State University in nearby Stephenville, according to\nIcon Global\nlisting agent Don Bell.\nThe ranch is 10 minutes from Glen Rose, an hour and a half from Dallas and an hour each way to Fort Worth and Waco.\nAlmost 9,000 square feet of living space are spread among several residences on the property, including a 3,500-square-foot, four-bedroom main house. The property includes a manager\u2019s house, several stocked tanks and a shooting range.\nBarry\u2019s memoirs testify to excellent hunting on the property, but Bell also talked up the property\u2019s fenced pastures and \u201cfull-service, world-class\u201d roping arena. The listing was marketed first to members of the National Cutting Horse Association.\nPatton, an oil and gas investor, Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioner, University of Texas donor and part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is also the owner of a less accomplished but more famous horse named Metallic Cat, which starred in an episode of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d Patton reportedly bought Metallic Cat for $14 million and won the rights to have the horse featured in the show at a charity auction.\nBell has a \u201cYellowstone\u201d connection as well.

        "content": "A four-year battle over a proposed 5,000-seat concert venue near the Austin suburb of\nDripping Springs\nis ending with a plot twist: the land is changing hands, and the venue is dead.\nAn affiliated entity of the Austin-based conservation group the Shield-Ayres Foundation agreed to buy the property near Fitzhugh Road and Crumley Ranch Road, where California-based Blizexas planned to build the Rockingwall Ranch Event Center, a move that will almost certainly terminate one of the Hill Country\u2019s most contentious projects, KXAN\nreported\n.\nThe plan had been a lightning rod since it surfaced, largely because the site sits atop environmentally sensitive terrain within the Barton Creek watershed and over a portion of the\nEdwards Aquifer Recharge Zone\n.\nNeighbors and environmental advocates warned that the amphitheater\u2019s wastewater and runoff could threaten the watershed, while sound, lighting and traffic from thousands of concertgoers would overwhelm the rural corridor.\nBlizexas sought a state permit to irrigate up to 12,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater on the site \u2014 a proposal that galvanized opposition.\nFor residents like Carrie Napiorkowski, whose driveway faces the property, the idea was almost unthinkable. The venue became a symbol of the\nHill Country\u2019s\nbroader fight over growth and land use as development pressure intensified west of Austin.\nShield Ranch, a long-standing conservation group and large landowner in the\nregion\n, emerged early as an opponent.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been actively opposed to this venue since the get-go,\u201d said Marshall Ayres Bowen, the group\u2019s vice president and general counsel. Bowen stressed the organization isn\u2019t anti-development but viewed the amphitheater as a severe mismatch for the area\u2019s ecological and community needs.\nThis week, Fitzhugh Ridge \u2014 a Shield Ranch-owned entity \u2014 announced a contract to purchase the land from Blizexas. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and the sale is expected to close in January. Blizexas didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nBowen framed the deal as the outcome of a broad, measured community effort rather than a reflexive NIMBY campaign. Residents met, organized and pressed regulators for years, presenting environmental concerns that ultimately shaped the alternative outcome.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just, \u2018We don\u2019t want this because we don\u2019t like it,\u2019\u201d Bowen told the outlet. \u201cIt was, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this\u2026 why we don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u2019\u201d\nWhat comes next for the land is unclear, but Bowen was definitive that a concert venue will not be built on that particular property. Napiorkowski said the announcement brought palpable relief.\n\u201cI really did believe David could beat the Goliath if you have enough people behind you,\u201d she said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is part of the Viterbi School of Engineering.\nIt was erected to \u201cfacilitate USC\u2019s artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced computing programs,\u201d per the suit filed in California Superior Court on Tuesday.\nThe HOK-designed building, which replaced a parking lot, marks USC\u2019s first LEED Platinum-certified structure. It includes a two-story lab for researching and testing autonomous aerial vehicles, open-plan robotics labs, student collaboration spaces and creativity zones, plus a 300-seat auditorium and amphitheater.\nAt a\nribbon-cutting ceremony\nin September 2024, then-USC President Carol Folt called the new building, \u201ca revolutionary space.\u201d She also touted to the media that the project took \u201cmore than 500,000 hours of labor, 12 million pounds of concrete and 145,000 bricks.\u201d\nIt is a \u201ccenterpiece in Folt\u2019s Frontiers of Computing \u2018moonshot,\u2019 a more than $1 billion initiative that supports ethical advancement in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced computing,\u201d the school said in a news release following the ceremony.\nYannis Yortsos, dean of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, said Ginsburg Hall was envisioned as the final piece of a campus trio with the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience and the Ray Irani Hall for Molecular and Computational Biology \u2014 a cluster meant to fuel work on everything from cancer to climate change.\nTurner signed a construction contract with the school on Nov. 17, 2020, making Turner the prime contractor for the project. The project was completed by this June.\nUSC is \u201crefusing to honor their contractual and legal obligations to compensate Turner and the trade contractors for their work,\u201d the suit says. In addition, the suit claims the school didn\u2019t \u201cissue change orders and make payments for delays, changes, extras, alterations, and interferences.\u201d\n\u201cWe are aware of the lawsuit and are reviewing it in detail,\u201d the university said in a statement.\n",

UTA has operated out of the DivcoWest-owned building at 9336-9346 Civic Center Drive since 2011;\nDivcoWest bought the building in 2018\nfrom the Rockefeller Group for $236 million. UTA shares the building with entertainment giant Live Nation, which also has its headquarters at UTA Plaza.\nUTA joins Artists First, another talent agency, in committing to office space Los Angeles as Hollywood studios have had leasing issues since the outbreak of the pandemic. Artists First signed a lease for nearly 23,000 square feet at Irvine Company\u2019s building at 2121 Avenue of the Stars in Century City. In 2023, Verve Talent Agency signed a 53,000-square-foot lease at Lincoln Property Company\u2019s BA/SE campus in Hollywood.\nIn August, Hackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital\nlocked down a $165 million refinancing loan\nfor the 315,000-square-foot Raleigh Studios campus on Melrose Avenue. Earlier this year, Hackman earned approval from the Los Angeles City Council for its $1 billion redevelopment endeavor at Television City; the firm is currently embroiled in a legal spat with Rick Caruso, who owns The Grove mall across the street, over the City Council\u2019s purported violation of environmental law in allowing the project to proceed.\nOn-location filming in Los Angeles has been on a decline since last year. In the third quarter of this year, on-location filming was down 13.2 percent from the third quarter of last year, per Film L.A. The drop-off was even more pronounced earlier this year when on-location filming\nfell\n22 percent in the first quarter year-over-year. In the past five years, the number of productions filming in L.A. has\ndropped\nby an average of 37 percent. Gov.

        "content": "The red-hot market for southwest Michigan luxury homes isn\u2019t slowing down.\nAs lakefront\nproperties in New Buffalo\nare getting slim, demand is moving northeast to Union Pier. A lavish contemporary house on Lake Michigan hit the market Friday asking nearly $9 million in Union Pier, which would set a record for the city if it sells at that price. On the same day, a nearby lakefront home closed for $5.1 million, well over its $4.6 million asking price and the highest sale price in Union Pier this year.\nThe activity underscores the success of the high-end second home market in Harbor Country, and elsewhere on Chicagoland waterfronts, where tight inventory is driving home prices up. In New Buffalo, two homes\nworth $7 million\n, and another at\n$9 million\n, went under contract in a matter of days this fall.\nPeggy Sayre, the listing agent for 15800 Lakeshore Road, the Union Pier home that sold for $5.1 million, said she set an ambitious price because of those recent New Buffalo sales. Sayre, part of the Dawn McKenna Group at Coldwell Banker Realty, listed the property alongside Mara Walsh.\n\u201cThey were selling like hotcakes,\u201d she said of the New Buffalo homes. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018All those people are going to come to ours next.\u2019 We went a little more aggressively with the price point and it really worked.\u201d\nSayre and Walsh got four offers over asking, and were able to close the deal quickly, going under contract five days after it hit the market on Oct. 31. The sale of the 3,000-square-foot home comes out to about $1,659 per square foot.\nThe property features a four-bedroom, three bathroom main house and a two-bedroom, one-bath coach house. The main Cape Cod-style house was built in 1992. The house has six beds and four bathrooms. It has 150 feet of private beach frontage.\nThe flurry of activity for luxury property in Harbor Country is unique for the usually sleepy month of November, Sayre said.\n\u201cIn all of the price points that I have listings on, I\u2019m getting multiple offers even on properties that have been sitting awhile,\u201d she said.\nThe home was recently renovated, which was a selling point for the buyers, said the buyer\u2019s agent Rob Gow of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago. \u201cIt was just a really beautiful renovation of a home,\u201d he said.\nThe house was owned by a trust under the name Joshua Hanna, and it was last purchased in 2018 for $2.3 million.\nJust down the road, the house at 15930 Lake Avenue in Union Pier is taking another shot at selling in the new buzzy market. The home was listed between June and October 2024 asking $7 million before being taken off the market. It went back on the market Friday asking $9 million.\nThe 4,510-square-foot Lake Avenue home has a circular design with floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows that look over Lake Michigan. The house has five beds and seven bathrooms, along with a detached guest house.\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\u2019s Liz Roch is the listing agent. Roch, who also listed the three homes in New Buffalo that went under contract recently, did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe home sits on nearly an acre and has 132 feet of private lake frontage, along with an in-ground pool and a tennis court.\nThe current owner bought the house in 2019 for $2.2 million. It\u2019s owned under an LLC that obscures the owner\u2019s identity.\n",

        "content": "A California investor scooped up one of the\nGold Coast\u2019s\nmarquee apartment towers, closing a nine-figure deal that underscores the strength of Chicago\u2019s rental market and the painful price resets still rippling through the city\u2019s investment landscape.\nSan Francisco-based Friedkin Property Group paid $130 million for the 26-story, 304-unit One East Delaware, according to Cook County records \u2014 one of downtown\u2019s priciest multifamily trades of the year, yet still a steep markdown from the sellers\u2019 basis, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe building at 1 East Delaware Place, was sold by a venture of\nGolub &amp; Co. and Alcion Ventures\n, which bought it for $146 million in 2016 and later poured another $30 million into renovations. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman brokered the transaction.\nAt roughly $428,000 per unit, the sale trails only the\nFulbrix\ndeal in Fulton Market and the Left Bank in the West Loop among 2025\u2019s top multifamily trades. The 233,115-square-foot building sold for about $558 per square foot.\nThe building also offers 37,000-square-feet of\nretail space\nthat is 87 percent leased.\nBut the pricing also highlights how far values have fallen for older downtown towers as large transactions are difficult to pencil amid high interest rates.\nThe Golub-Alcion venture refinanced the property in late 2021 with a $113.5 million loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2024. Whether the lenders provided an extension was unclear, but the clock was ticking.\nIt\u2019s not the first Golub-related asset to take a hit. Chestnut Place, across the street from One East Delaware and recapitalized last year by another Golub venture, traded at roughly 20 percent below its 2017 price. That 280-unit building sold for $85.2 million, or about $304,000 per unit \u2014 another marker of the reset underway in the\nGold Coast\n.\nGolub\npublicly brushed off the broader market turbulence when it brought One East Delaware to market in May, calling it a \u201chigh-performing asset\u201d in a prime neighborhood.\nThe fundamentals back that up: the 1989-built tower was 95 percent occupied at listing, with studio, one- and two-bedroom units averaging nearly $3,000 a month, or $3.90 per square foot, according to CoStar. With only one major downtown apartment building delivered this year,\nrents climbed\nmore than 8 percent year over year in the third quarter, Integra data shows.\nFor Friedkin, the deal adds a rare downtown stake to a Chicago-area portfolio otherwise concentrated in the suburbs, including Naperville, Evanston, Elk Grove Village and Aurora.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Plan Commission plowed through a backlog of long-awaited proposals Thursday, advancing a slate of projects that could reshape pockets of the city from\nLincoln Park\nto the\nFar South Side\n.\nThe approvals don\u2019t guarantee shovels in the ground, but they clear the first major hurdle for developers angling to move forward after years of community debate, shifting market conditions and pandemic delays, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nDePaul\nUniversity\u2019s $42 million basketball practice facility was among the headline items.\nThe school won initial approval to build the four-story training hub at 2300\u20132316 North Sheffield Avenue, replacing a row of historic three-flats in the Sheffield National Historic District.\nThe project, first floated in 2022, drew opposition from preservationists and neighborhood groups who argued the demolitions would chip away at a streetscape that\u2019s stood since the 1890s. The Sheffield Neighborhood Association said the plan represented \u201ca continuation of the deterioration of the historic street wall,\u201d even as it emphasized its long-standing partnership with the university.\nPreservation Chicago\nalso lined up against the proposal, noting that two of the structures DePaul plans to raze are orange-rated \u2014 indicating potentially significant architectural features.\nBut university leaders pointed to support from other community organizations and stressed the need to upgrade facilities to stay competitive. Architect Joseph Antunovich told commissioners DePaul has \u201cfallen behind\u201d its peers. To soften the blow of demolitions, the school agreed to back landmark status for Cortelyou Commons and Byrne Hall, two of the oldest buildings on campus.\nOn the Far South Side, commissioners granted first approvals for\nMorgan Park Commons\n, a redevelopment of the long-vacant former Jewel grocery site and adjacent Halsted Indoor Mall.\nThe 12-acre corner at 115th and Halsted streets has sat empty for roughly 15 years, but Far South Community Development Corporation and its partners have been working since 2018 to revive it with housing, retail, open space and cultural programming. The city, which owns half the land after acquiring it from Albertsons, plans to transfer its stake to the nonprofit developer.\nPhase one calls for a $65 million investment across two buildings totaling 70 apartments \u2014 including studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms \u2014 as well as live/work units.\nInfrastructure work will remake local streets, creating South Peoria Street and West 114th Place. Preservation of Affordable Housing is slated to co-develop the first residential phase, with construction targeted for next year.\nPlanning commissioner Ciere Boatright called the effort \u201ca long time coming\u201d for a corridor that hasn\u2019t seen a mixed-use residential project in more than half a century.\nOn the North Side in\nEdgewater\n, a five-story condo building at 6150 North Sheridan Road also secured approval. The 40-unit structure, slated to replace the former Kindred Hospital parking lot, will feature underground parking, a roof deck and private outdoor space for ground-floor units. Developer Vladimir Zeleni expects the $15 million project could be delivered by mid-2027, pending City Council sign-off.\nThe commission approved two more towers in the development hotspot Fulton Market.\nProjects at 1200 West Carroll Avenue and 214 North Morgan Street will bring a combined 665 apartments to the booming district. The Carroll Avenue building will also carve out green space programmed for craft markets and outdoor movie nights \u2014 a rare amenity in one of the densest pockets of the Near West Side.\nAnd in\nNorth Lawndale\n, commissioners advanced plans for the $38 million One Lawndale Recreation Center, replacing a vacant former CTA storage lot at Springfield Avenue and Cermak Road.\nThe proposed multisport complex would house two indoor turf fields, five basketball courts, boxing and wrestling rooms, a multipurpose space, concessions and a pro shop. The center is projected to host roughly 250,000 visits annually and could start construction next year, with completion slated for fall 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A number of notable landlords and developers found themselves in trouble in New York this week.\nSteve Croman is combating\nmore than 28 active foreclosure lawsuits\ntargeting properties he controls. In total, lenders allege Croman\u2019s entities defaulted on more than $231 million in loan principals.\nTwenty-one of the foreclosure suits were filed in the last week, many zby lender Orange Owner LLC. The principal of those associated loans totals more than $189 million\nIn a court filing, Croman denied many of the allegations.\nBut it\u2019s just the latest issue for the man once dubbed the city\u2019s worst landlord, who served an eight-month stint for mortgage and tax fraud and was sued over the summer by his own father.\nCroman\u2019s not the only real estate figure involved in a difficult family affair. The Ostad brothers,\na trio of New York real estate investors\n, were named as\ndefendants\nin nine foreclosure suits related to loans totaling more than $70 million.\nThe brothers stopped making payments on the loans in April, according to the plaintiff. That\u2019s the same month that\nMichael and Edward sued Steven\n, hoping to dissolve their family partnerships; Steven is only named in three of the cases, while his brothers are named in all of them.\nThe older Ostad brothers lead fix-and-flip lender Flatiron Realty Capital. Steven is the founder of residential brokerage Empire City Realty and lender Real Quick Capital, though both appear to be closed.\nNo stranger to his only family drama, Alex Sapir is in the midst of the messy process to wind down his business.\nSapir Corp\nplaced\nits Nomo Soho hotel into Chapter 11, the latest development in the ongoing collapse and liquidation of the Israeli-backed real estate company.\nThe firm is seeking to run a court-supervised auction for the 26-story boutique hotel at 9 Crosby Street. Its petition is designed to cement a sale and pay down Sapir Corp\u2019s $155 million in bond debt across two Israeli bond series.\nThe bankruptcy filing comes three weeks after Sapir\nentered insolvency proceedings\nin Israel, where the company told the Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court it could no longer meet bond payments or cover operating costs. All of its directors resigned and a trustee is overseeing the company as it winds down.\nElsewhere in the city, Manhattan\u2019s favorite contested sculpture garden was back in the news this week, courtesy of a feud between the outgoing and incoming mayors.\nThe would-be developers of the Haven Green affordable housing complex at the Elizabeth Street Garden\nsued\nthe city, claiming the mayor illegally dedicated the site as a city park.\nPennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester, who were chosen in 2017 to build 123 senior housing units on the city-owned site, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday.\nThey want the court to annul the parkland designation.\nAhead of the November election, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nindicated\nthat he would move forward with Haven Green and evict the garden. After the Adams administration declared the land a park, Mamdani told reporters that pursuing the project would be \u201c\nnearly impossible\n,\u201d as using city parkland for other uses would require action by the state legislature.\nPerhaps the lawsuit makes it a little less impossible.\nFinally, when the city began its search for developers of a site in the Meatpacking District, the request for proposals encouraged \u2014 but did not mandate \u2014 the\ninclusion\nof an \u201cemerging developer.\u201d\nThe RFP described a candidate that had completed fewer than 10 projects in the past decade, each with fewer than 150 residential units, no more than 100,000 square feet and a cost below $30 million. Simple enough.\nSo the EDC\nselected\nKinwood Partners \u2014 alongside Douglaston Development \u2014 to build 590 housing units on a city-owned site.\nKinwood hasn\u2019t developed anything, so all good, right?\nWell, it\u2019s led by someone \u2014 David Himmel \u2014 who spent a decade working for a major real estate firm as well as on projects in the neighborhood. Himmel is the former chief operating officer at Jamestown and son of Leslie Wohlman Himmel, co-founder of investment firm Himmel &amp; Meringoff Properties.\nNaturally, the firm\u2019s selection raised questions about the intent of designations like \u201cemerging developer\u201d in public-private endeavors.\n",

        "content": "Some of the biggest names in residential real estate traded the boardroom for a drab Manhattan courtroom this week.\nThe four-day hearing kicked off on Tuesday with testimony from Compass CEO Robert Reffkin on his firm\u2019s lawsuit against Zillow\u2019s rules barring agents from listing homes on the platform that were publicly marketed outside of the MLS.\nCompass\nsued the aggregator\nin June, seeking to block what it deemed \u201canticompetitive\u201d policies enacted after the firm rolled out a new marketing strategy, which begins with sellers listing their homes on Compass\u2019 private exclusive listing network.\nJoining Reffkin\nin the courtroom\nwere some of his top New York City agents, including the company\u2019s chief evangelist, Leonard Steinberg, leader of the Litvak Team, Eugene Litvak and Heather Domi, who co-founded the New York Residential Agent Continuum.\nReffkin and his attorneys echoed arguments laid out in court filings, including that Zillow\u2019s updated rules, dubbed the Zillow Ban, were adopted specifically \u201cto quash the threat posted by Compass,\u201d the firm\u2019s lawyer, Kenneth Dintzer, said in court.\nThe following day, Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman, in from the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle,\ntook the stand\n, where he pushed back against the notion that Zillow implemented its listing rules to target Compass alone. He also rebuffed Dintzer\u2019s attempts to cast Compass as one of Zillow\u2019s direct competitors.\nIf you ask the two firms involved, the fight unfolding in court isn\u2019t just a clash of corporate egos. It\u2019s also about the future of how residential agents conduct their business and who gets a hand in the process. (Though what it\u2019s really about is the potential millions of dollars either company could forfeit if the other gets its way.)\nManhattan is a fitting venue for the two companies to duke it out. It\u2019s not just that Compass is headquartered here, but if Reffkin prevails, he\u2019ll also be expanding a home marketing system that already exists, to a certain degree, in New York City and other luxury markets.\nThe city runs on deals inked off public listing platforms. Earlier this month, a mansion in Gravesend, Brooklyn,\nsold for $32 million, setting a borough record\nwithout ever hitting the open market.\nAt new developments, developers often start signing contracts for units before any listings ever make it to StreetEasy or Zillow. Take Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital\u2019s 80 Clarkson. Rumor has it that a significant share of its condos have\nalready found buyers\n, yet the sales team hasn\u2019t posted a single listing.\nRelying on well-connected agents who facilitate trades for high-profile or high-net-worth clients behind closed doors, the city\u2019s market thrives on relationships and access, and having the right dose of both is how agents prove their value. Reffkin\u2019s vision mirrors this environment: agents working with Compass, soon to be the largest brokerage by far, have access to the most inventory, which they can (and likely already are) leveraging to bring more buyers their way.\nDespite the prevalence of off-market deals in the city, most sales are still the result of properties hitting the open market, and it\u2019s likely that will remain the case. Even Compass\u2019 own data shows that most homes marketed as private exclusives ultimately end up on MLSs, and therefore, aggregators like Zillow.\nNot so fast\u2026\nA New York City-based proptech startup just snagged a fresh venture capital infusion.\nTulu, which allows tenants to rent items such as vacuum cleaners, virtual reality headsets and Play Stations through an artificial intelligence-powered app, closed its Series A funding round with $37 million in investments, including $17 million from GreenSoil PropTech Ventures, Bosch Ventures and New Era Capital Partners.\nThe fresh round of financing for the startup \u2014 which counts among its clients major landlords in the city such as Related, Brookfield and RXR \u2014 comes after venture capitalists\nlargely shied away from\ninvesting in proptech startups.\nFunding for proptechs hit all-time highs in 2021, when investors pumped\nroughly $9.5 billion\ninto the sector to back ventures such as residential agent back-end service, Place, and data platform, CompStak.\nBut the rush of capital proved to be overkill. Several once-promising startups were failing or showing major signs of collapse, scaring off venture capitalists looking to throw their weight behind a rising industry. In the first half of 2024, funding for proptechs fell more than 14 percent compared to the same period in 2023, according to data from the Center for Real Estate Technology and Innovation.\nBut earlier this year, Brendan Wallace, CEO and CIO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\ntide could be turning\n. He may have cited his own company\u2019s moves as proof \u2014 including CBRE\u2019s acquisition of Industrious, a company Wallace backs, in a deal valued at $800 million \u2014 but he was firm in his prediction of a \u201cmomentum shift.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to hit city records last week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street. Unit 42E, which has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, sold for just under $45 million to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an LLC known as Pipedream 66.\n",

        "content": "New York University\u2019s Furman Center held a panel Wednesday morning on the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock.\nAt one point, Samuel Stein, a senior policy analyst at Community Service Society, made a somewhat radical suggestion: Given the distress in rent-stabilized buildings, if landlords don\u2019t take part in well-designed city programs meant to help them, maybe someone else should take over.\nThen, suddenly, the lights went out.\n\u201cThe specter of government ownership!\u201d Stein joked.\nIt\u2019s an interesting time for rent-stabilized housing. Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful mayoral campaign has contributed to a sense of left-wing momentum, all while distress in the sector is growing and buildings are selling for a fraction of their peak prices. Could those conditions give rise to a government or nonprofit takeover of buildings?\nSome progressives think so. Mamdani has\ncooled his anti-landlord rhetoric\nrecently, but the advocates who may have his ear still have bold ideas about the future of New York\u2019s housing stock.\nStein acknowledges that distress in rent-stabilized buildings is a real problem. Government programs can provide relief, he said, but not if they are poorly designed, like the city\u2019s Unlocking Doors program. (Gothamist reported that\nnot one landlord\nhas participated in the program.)\nHowever, even when programs are well-designed, many landlords may just not want to work with the government, Stein contends. Or they may be more focused on ways to achieve higher rents, which increases property values.\nAnd if landlords aren\u2019t interested in what the city\u2019s offering, maybe it\u2019s time for tenants, community land trusts or the city itself to take over, he said.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not interested in doing the right thing, that\u2019s when we move to alternative ownership,\u201d Stein said in an interview.\nCea Weaver, who directs Housing Justice for All, has a similar vision. Writing for\nPhenomenal World\na few weeks ago, Weaver imagines the city could purchase buildings, now at fire sale prices, from owners who want to sell. It could then lease out the ability to collect rents and, with a vast enough portfolio, cross-subsidize between higher- and lower-income buildings.\nSetting aside ideological objections, experts and advocates I\u2019ve chatted with had some concerns with these plans. They would be expensive, for one, not to mention the city is bad at stewarding things, they said. Plus, a change in ownership would not inherently fix the issue of economic distress in these buildings. Revenue (i.e., rent) would still have to go up.\nStein accepts this last point, but says there are other benefits to these models, like greater trust and more democratic control of tenants\u2019 living conditions.\nStill, despite the ascendance of the city\u2019s left wing, many politicians wouldn\u2019t be on board for this level of intervention.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any need for some fundamental change in the ownership structure of these buildings,\u201d said State Sen. Brian Kavanagh when I asked him about Stein\u2019s ideas.\nBut some are taking small steps in that direction. A City Council committee is considering the bill COPA, which, as written, would delay building sales by several months to allow nonprofit organizations a first opportunity to purchase.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement, there\u2019s a lot of organizing,\u201d Stein said of this political moment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hair-pulling among the landlord class.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThree state senate committees are running an investigation into why residential insurance costs have skyrocketed. Do you have thoughts about why premiums are up? Have soaring insurance costs wrecked your finances? Drop me a line at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe average household income among renters in Veris Realty\u2019s properties is $480,000, as Jay Parsons spotted and\nposted to X/Twitter\nthis morning.\nElsewhere:\n\u2013 Mamdani met President Trump at the Oval Office today. The two struck a positive tone. \u201cI feel very confident that he can do a very good job,\u201d Trump said of Mamdani, adding that the two agree on more than he thought.\n\u2013 Nydia Velazquez, the 16-term, 72-year-old state representative, said she will not run for reelection in 2026. That opens up a seat in New York\u2019s seventh congressional district, which runs through many Mamdani strongholds, including Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Bushwick, Ridgewood, Long Island City and the mayor-elect\u2019s own Astoria.\n\u2013 One man singlehandedly delayed 755 subway trains in October by pulling copper wiring off the tracks at 149th Street-Grand Concourse,\nGothamist\nreported.\nClosing time:\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$21 million\nfor 111 West 57th Street, Unit 58. The Midtown Central condo is 4,200 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nNikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18.03 million\nfor 212 Lafayette Street. The rental unit in Soho is five stories, has 16 units and is 8,800 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $26.9 million for 133 East 73rd Street, Unit PH. The Lenox Hill condo is 6,700 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "President Donald Trump joins the list of New York City developers who see common ground with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani when it comes to housing.\nTrump said on Friday that he was surprised by how much he agreed with the democratic socialist, especially when it came to issues of affordability.\n\u201cHe wants to see no crime, he wants to see housing being built, he wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,\u201d Trump told reporters\nduring a joint media briefing\non Friday.\nMamdani met with Trump in Washington, D.C., on Friday, and then the two fielded questions from reporters in the Oval Office.\nIt seems Mamdani was able to tap into an issue core to Trump\u2019s personality: New York City development. The president said one of the things he gleaned from their meeting was that Mamdani agreed that the way to drive down rents is to build more housing. The president said this hadn\u2019t been clear to him, based on media reports. He was presumably referring to Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. The mayor-elect has also said he wants to build 200,000 apartments in the next decade.\n\u201cHe\u2019d like to see them come down, ideally, by building a lot of additional housing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate way. He agrees with that, and so do I.\u201d\nThe two would presumably not see eye to eye on zoning reform. The Trump administration rolled back Obama-era rules that required local governments that receive federal funds to address discriminatory housing policies, including zoning rules that have reinforced segregation. He has also\ndecried\nforcing suburbs to welcome low-income housing into their neighborhoods.\nMamdani said the two also discussed the need for housing regulations to be manageable and not further delay construction. When asked about comments he made about wanting to raise taxes on \u201cricher, whiter neighborhoods,\u201d Mamdani pushed back on the reporter\u2019s characterization of the phrase as \u201crace-based property taxes,\u201d saying that this was referring to the makeup of neighborhoods, not an expression of intent.\n\u201cWe intend to create a fair property tax system because we want a New York City that is not only fair and equitable, but also one that every New Yorker can afford,\u201d the mayor-elect said.\nThe two displayed a surprising amount of warmth toward each other, given that Trump has referred to Mamdani as a \u201c\ncommunist lunatic\n\u201d and stoked fears that he would deploy National Guard officers in the city. Mamdani has also not been shy about criticizing the president. During his\nvictory speech\nthis month, Mamdani addressed Trump directly and said the city could show the rest of the nation how to defeat him.\nBut Trump said he wants to help New York City and said he would feel comfortable living under a Mamdani administration.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI expect to be helping him, not hurting him.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A pair of neighboring waterfront properties spanning more than 13 acres set a new record for the tony Connecticut enclave of Westport.\nTogether, the Beachside Avenue plots sold for $45 million, according to listing agent Leslie Clarke of Compass. The sellers, former commodity trader Andrew Bentley and his wife Fiona Garland, built the sprawling waterfront home on 120-122 Beachside Avenue and commissioned a 75-foot pool on the neighboring property, along with a contemporary barn.\nOne of the properties was previously owned by TV personality Phil Donahue and his wife, actress Marlo Thomas, which Bentley and Garland bought for $20 million in 2013. They purchased the other for another $20 million in 2010, according to property records.\nAnother of the famous couple\u2019s former properties, at 114 Beachside Avenue,\nheld the previous price record for the area\nwhen it sold for $25 million in 2006.\nSpanning over 11,000 square feet and sitting on over six acres, the mansion at 120-122 Beachside Avenue originally hit the market alone in 2020,\nasking $28 million\n. After popping on and off the market over the next several years, it returned at the start of this year asking $25 million.\nThe home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and a four-car garage.\nClarke said that combining the properties presented a \u201cunique opportunity for the buyer to have almost 14 acres that couldn\u2019t have happened anywhere else.\u201d\nBentley and Garland appear to be trying to liquidate their holdings on the exclusive stretch of road running along the Long Island Sound. The pair also listed the former properties of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein for\n$21 million in 2023\n.\nThose properties, at 26 and 28 Beachside Avenue, sold for over $17 million combined in separate but related transactions, according to Clarke. Bentley and Garland bought them for $16 million in 2018.\n",

        "content": "The Creedmoor Psychiatric Center is one step closer to a massive housing redevelopment, a project that will leave housing advocates wondering if more could\u2019ve been constructed.\nThe state\u2019s Public Authorities Control Board approved the administration\u2019s redevelopment plans for a 58-acre portion of the Queens Village campus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Construction is expected to start in 2027 and wrap in 2029, though a developer still needs to be selected for the site.\nUnder the plan, a mix of 2,000 affordable and market-rate rental and purchasable units will be developed on the long-vacant site. There will be senior, veteran and supportive housing options.\nThe development will also include more than 10 acres of open space, retail and community space, expected to include a public school, a childcare facility and space for seniors.\nThe administration will pull funds from a $500 million pot earmarked for housing developments on state-owned land. That is not expected to cover the entirety of the project.\nThe master plan for Creedmoor, released in December 2023, called for\nmore than 2,800 homes\n. But density concerns led to negotiations between Empire State Development and local officials, resulting in a compromise that cut roughly 850 units from the proposal.\nFive of the planned eight-story buildings were also axed from the proposal. The agreement,\nrevealed\nin August, created a 27 percent decrease in overall unit square footage and a 15 percent reduction in units allocated for individuals with mental illnesses.\nCreedmoor has been around since 1912, when it opened as a satellite facility of Brooklyn State Hospital. It began as a psychiatric \u201cfarm colony\u201d where patients took part in daily work as part of a therapy regimen.\nThe full campus spans 125 acres. Most of its buildings \u2014 19 out of 25 \u2014 are vacant. Multiple state-led agencies are expected to continue providing services to patients on the remaining 67 acres at Creedmoor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Morgan Chase\nbranch in\nMountain View\nblew up at a tense city council meeting this week.\nThe South Carolina-based developer threatened to sue the City of Mountain View moments before officials voted on its $350 million plan calling for 299 apartments, ground-floor retail and a rebuilt Chase branch at 749 West El Camino Real, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAt the center of the debate was Greystar\u2019s request to stretch its construction timeline from two years to eight, as well as other requests for financial credits for the project\u2019s public benefits and to build a permanent loading zone along Victor Way.\nThe timeline extension was the biggest sticking point; officials approved the project plan and more than $1 million in credit toward community benefits and asked that the company work with city staff to designate a loading zone on Victor Way. But it denied the request for the eight-year timeline.\nGreystar has worked five years on the project, and its attorney accused the city of \u201ca lot of negative intent,\u201d\n\u201cWhen the market and interest rates are funky, you just can\u2019t finance a $350-million project on the drop of a hat, especially with an artificial deadline in front of you,\u201d Tamsen Plume, an attorney for the developer, said at the meeting.\nGreystar had asked for an extension several times prior Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but the City turned down each one. City officials said Greystar didn\u2019t provide evidence that extending the timeline by six years would cut down on the costs of building\naffordable apartments\n, instead saying it would actually increase costs.\n\u201cIt took us four years as an applicant to get the project approved, and then you\u2019re going to hold us to two years to break ground,\u201d Dan Diebel, a representative for Greystar, said at the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable. All we\u2019re asking is for the city to be reasonable.\u201d\nThe council also echoed staff concerns that the extension amounted to land banking, a practice that has earned a derided reputation in cities desperate for near-term housing production. The City of Mountain View must\nplan\nfor 11,135 new housing units by 2031 as part of its state-mandated housing goals.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Tishman Speyer handles leasing at the property.\nNvidia\u2019s plans for the site are not yet known. Its relatively small size and proximity to the headquarters of artificial intelligence companies like\nOpenAI\n, Anthropic and Sierra implies it could be a sales office or events space rather than a home for engineering and research and development operations.\nSierra signed the largest office lease of the year in San Francisco a few blocks away at 185 Berry Street in China Basin, rivaling OpenAI\u2019s 315,000-square-foot\nexpansion in Mission Bay last year\n.\nNvidia\u2019s San Francisco lease comes after the tech giant shared better-than-expected profits in its third-quarter earnings report as its valuation grew past $5 billion.\nIts third-quarter profits were $31.9 billion, up 65 percent from the third quarter of last year and 245 percent from the third quarter of 2023.

        "content": "Meyers Accesso won a Boca Raton board\u2019s backing of its proposed 289,677-square-foot, mixed-use development.\nThe Boca Raton Planning &amp; Zoning Board voted 4 to 0 Thursday evening to endorse a request by Meyers Accesso affiliate BRI 1885 Atrium at Boca LP to approve two ordinances and three resolutions that pave the way for the development of an eight-story complex. It will have 222 apartments (including 23 affordable and 12 workforce housing units), 2,015 square feet of restaurants and retail and a four-level parking structure on what is now a parking lot for the office building called Atrium at Broken Sound at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway. The office building will remain.\nThe developer also is seeking to rezone from recreational to light industrial research park its 0.9-acre sliver of the 140.2-acre Old Course at Broken Sound. Michael Marshall, an attorney with Nelson Mullins who represents BRI 1885 Atrium, said his client does not intend to build on the golf course portion, is forbidden to do so by a restrictive covenant, and the request is just a \u201chousekeeping measure.\u201d (Most of The Old Course golf course is owned by Broken Sound Club, a private golf club.)\nArchitect Garcia Stromberg\u2019s design for the eight-story building shows a 12,945-square-foot amenity rooftop deck with a 2,200-square-foot pool. The development\u2019s apartments would consist of 39 three-bedrooms, 109 two-bedrooms, 73 one-bedrooms and an efficiency, according to a city memo.\nThe 10.5-acre property, which includes the Atrium at Broken Sound office building and a 2.43-acre portion of the golf course, was acquired by Meyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso Partners,\nfor $25 million in January 2024\n.\nAtrium at Broken Sound is within the Park at Broken Sound, a 700-acre residential and commercial planned development that has attracted investment and development in recent years. In June, the Boca Raton City Council approved plans for a seven-story,\n289-unit mixed-income apartment project\nat 900 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway that will include 44 workforce and affordable housing units, a barbeque area and a dog park. And in March, Oak Plane Partners proposed a\n243-unit Live Local Act project\nnext to its office headquarters at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard.\nFormed in 2022, the Meyers Accesso joint-venture recently proposed building an eight story,\n200-unit apartment development in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek area\ncalled Avery Cypress Creek. Meyers Accesso also\ncompleted a $46 million, 200-unit apartment community in Lake Worth Beach\n.\nMeyers Group was founded in 2015 by Stuart I. Meyers, who served as CEO and chairman until his death in June at the age of 83. Following Meyers\u2019 passing,\nAlan Losada\nwas named CEO. Meyers Group is negotiating to build a\n$192 million mixed-use commercial project near Disney\nin Kissimmee.\nFounded 21 years ago, Accesso Partners is led by managing partners Ariel Bentana, Moises Benzaquen, Claudio Dombey and Daniel Goldstein. According to its website, Accesso Partners has owned or managed $3.3 billion of commercial or residential development in multiple states.",

        "content": "Former Chicago Bulls\nguard Zach LaVine\noffloaded his Gold Coast condo for $6.4 million, taking a loss on the property he bought three years ago.\nLaVine, who was traded to the Sacramento Kings in February, bought the 28th-floor condo at\n9 West Walton\nfor $6.9 million in 2022, taking it over from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack. He listed it for the same price in March, taking about a 7 percent loss on the final sale price.\nNancy Tassone with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented LaVine in the sale. She declined to comment. Jeff Lowe, a Compass agent who represented the buyer, declined to share details about the purchaser, whose name is not yet available in public records.\nThe 4,500-square-foot unit has three bedrooms and four bathrooms. It features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace equipped with a hot tub, and a 60-inch linear fireplace in the living room.\nThe primary suite is outfitted with a sitting room and a built-in bar, along with a bathroom that includes a custom tub with a pop-up TV lift and a built-in champagne bucket.\nLowe, who has sold units in the building to multiple clients, said the condo tower\u2019s units have some of the most expansive outdoor spaces in the area.\n\u201cThe outdoor space is incredible. It\u2019s also boutique, the amenities are awesome,\u201d he said.\nThe 2024 tax bill for the unit was close to $120,000, according to public records, and it carries a $4,900 monthly homeowner\u2019s association fee.\nLaVine\u2019s exit marks the latest turnover in a building that has become a hot spot for Chicago\u2019s elite athletes and billionaires.\nIn addition to Lavine\u2019s purchase from Mack, billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin purchased the top four floors of the building for more than $58 million in 2017. After leaving Chicago for Miami, Griffin offloaded the units for a\nsignificant loss\n. Gov. J.B. Pritzker bought two for $19 million.\nPatrick Kane, a legendary former Blackhawks skater, also\nsold his 25th-floor condo\nthere for $6.4 million earlier this year.\n",

TMC president\nBill McKeon\nunveiled the plan at the system\u2019s annual State of the TMC event last week.\nConstruction is slated to start next year. McKeon kept quiet on development partners but said the project fills a glaring gap in the campus: space for people to stay, meet and network without shuttling across the city.\nThe three-pronged buildout would mark a major expansion of Helix Park, the Old Spanish Trail site that until recently was mostly parking lots.\nThe first phase opened in 2023, with the TMC3 Collaborative Building and\nBeacon Capital\u2019s\nDynamic One\ntower, creating a landing spot for commercial tenants hoping to plug into TMC\u2019s research pipeline.\nVenture capital firm Portal Innovations is already subleasing to startups there, and anchors like Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist and Rice\u2019s RBL have moved in.\nMcKeon signaled this next step months ago.\nTMC said last year that a hotel, conference center and multifamily residences were always part of the master plan, with the final unit count dependent on market demand and how the buildings stack up on the northern edge of the site.\nThe hotel and conference center are intended to serve everything from investor summits to scientific gatherings \u2014 events TMC has long hosted but lacked the infrastructure to keep on campus.\nThe project arrives as TMC pushes to make Helix Park a 24/7 district rather than a 9-to-5 research zone. Housing would give the campus its first wave of full-time residents and further blur the line between academic, clinical and commercial activity.\nFor a cluster that draws millions of visitors annually, lodging and meeting space have been conspicuously absent.\nMcKeon also rolled out a companion initiative: a $5.5 million overhaul of The Commons at 6550 Bertner Avenue.\nElkus Manfredi Architects\n\u2014 the Boston firm behind Helix Park\u2019s design \u2014 is planning to convert the concrete structure into a park centerpiece. That project is also expected to start next year, according to a state filing.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago real estate lobbyist Michael Glasser led a crowd of hundreds of industry pros in a call-and-response chant Thursday night as he took the stage in a jam-packed lakefront venue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not landlords. What are we?\u201d Glasser asked the audience in his pep rally-style address.\n\u201cHousing providers!\u201d the crowd chanted in unison.\nGlasser hadn\u2019t prepped them on what to say before his callout at the annual Lincoln Park Builder\u2019s Forum at the Theater on the Lake, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been working behind the scenes to get his message across.\nDemocratic Socialist Zohran\nMamdani won New York City\u2019s mayoral election\nthis month by positioning landlords as the enemy of affordability and Glasser said he fears that same image can be applied to Chicago\u2019s landlords.\n\u201cWe know that public perception counts,\u201d he said.\nGlasser\u2019s audience at the annual gathering of real estate players seemed energized by his speech. They cheered when he talked about thwarting Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s progressive agenda and laughed when he threw in double entendres for extra flair.\nIf New York\u2019s real estate industry is\nabout to begin its competition to win back political power\n, Chicago\u2019s is at halftime and feeling confident.\nGlasser, who was accepting the Lincoln Park Builders\u2019 2025 Impact Award, listed off recent accomplishments of his organization, the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance, which has become an active lobbying group.\nIt was instrumental in\na well-funded campaign\nto defeat Johnson\u2019s proposal to increase the city\u2019s real estate transfer tax and successfully swayed two aldermen to\nrevoke their support for a right of first refusal ordinance\nfor the Northwest Side\u2019s multifamily market.\nStill, fears remain over another\nright of first refusal rule proposed for South Shore\nand any possibility that rent control could gain traction at the state house.\nMeanwhile, more than\nhalfway through Johnson\u2019s term\n, his approval rating is faltering and\nrents are growing more quickly in Chicago\nthan pretty much anywhere else in the country \u2014 a trend the mayor campaigned on reversing. Part of that rent growth can be attributed to a\nsteep dropoff in new multifamily construction\n.\nBut who, or what, to blame that on is up for debate. Some have pointed to broader economic factors like interest rates and construction costs while others focus their attention locally, especially on\nChicago\u2019s complex property tax system\n.\nFollowing Glasser\u2019s speech, a forum with developer AMLI\u2019s CEO Gregory Mutz, former Illinois Senate President John Cullerton and former Chicago Alderman James Cappleman aimed to find answers.\nThe forum\u2019s moderator Belgravia Chairman Alan Lev dressed up as an English barrister complete with a powdered wig and judge\u2019s robe. He began the forum by asking the panelists to swear to tell the whole truth \u201cor a little bit of the truth.\u201d\nDown in Texas, Austin has been\nbuilding significantly more housing per year\nbecause, Mutz said, the city\u2019s affordable housing policies are less restrictive than\nChicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance\n. Chicago\u2019s rule, commonly referred to as the ARO, generally requires that multifamily developers seeking zoning changes or financial assistance from the city set aside 10 to 20 percent of their units as affordable to people making 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe result is that developers either choose not to build at all or justify higher market rate rents via amenities to offset the cost of the lower-rent units, Mutz said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got amenities out the wazoo. I mean, it\u2019s crazy what we\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re a poor person with a dog, Christ \u2026 these dog spas we\u2019re building are nuts,\u201d he said.\nCappleman, the former alderman whose soft-spoken cadence is likely a remnant of the time he previously spent as a Franciscan friar, chimed in.\n\u201cIf we look at all the affordable housing in the city of Chicago \u2014 I\u2019m talking about CHA housing, HUD housing, not-for-profit housing, and housing finance through Low Income Housing Tax Credits and ARO housing \u2014 how much of that do we get from the ARO? It is 1.8 percent. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe moderator, Lev, who had removed his wig by this point, cut in.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. How do we get our governmental officials to see that, understand that and change it, as opposed to just tweaking it and making it more onerous?\u201d he asked Cappleman.\nCappleman responded that the ARO is ineffective but changes to it would be a political landmine for aldermen who list landlords \u201cbelow drug dealers\u201d on their list of priorities. Instead, Cappleman said, the members of the audience should focus their messaging toward renters and push for policies that allow developers to build more naturally occurring affordable housing.\nThe strategy talk comes at a time when political power is up for grabs in Chicago. In 2026, Illinois will see\na major shakeup\namong its members of Congress with five seats set to be vacated. Among the candidates running for U.S. Senate is\nJason Friedman, son of Chicago real estate giant Al Friedman\n. (Any mention of the 18 years he spent as president of his father\u2019s development firm was left off his campaign website).\nWhile incumbent J.B. Pritzker is favored to win the governor\u2019s race, he is also a rumored candidate for president in 2028. And commercial real estate and video gambling company owner\nRick Heidner recently threw his hat in the gubernatorial ring\n.\nIn 2027, Mayor Johnson will be up for re-election and he\u2019s already drawn potential opponents. Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas\nannounced her run this week\nand several other candidates across local and state levels of government are rumored to be joining her.\nIn the meantime, Glasser ended his speech with two final requests for the audience.\n\u201cFor those of you who are interested, please come join us. For those of you who aren\u2019t interested, but you still benefit from what we do, think about that transfer tax that didn\u2019t happen and cut us a check,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "The Rexford takeover rumors seem to have traction.\nThe industrial real estate investment trust indicated as much a couple days ago, after market close, when it announced a chief executive shakeup and a changed capital allocation strategy.\nThe dual announcements came months after a report that Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management built an active stake in the company. Rexford more recently took the opportunity of an earnings call, to disclose that it had met with the relentless activist investor.\nRexford chief operating officer Laura Clark is now in line to succeed co-CEOs and co-founders Michael Frankel and Howard Schwimmer, the company announced. Chairman Tyler Rose, who recently replaced Richard Ziman, said the \u201ctransition is the culmination of the board\u2019s multi-year succession planning process.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to it, according to Newport Beach-based industry tracker and data analyst Green Street.\n\u201cIt appeared Ms. Clark was on the path to eventually succeed Co-CEOs Frankel and Schwimmer upon their retirement, but there is no question that Elliott\u2019s involvement sped up the timeline,\u201d a Green Street analysis read.\nFrankel and Schwimmer aren\u2019t only dropping their C-suite gigs, but their seats on the board of directors, too, which was characterized as a surprise in a recent BMO analysis.\nNonetheless, Frankel and Schwimmer have entered into a transition and separation agreement, each being granted a restricted stock award valued at $22.6 million. That\u2019s more than their $13 million total\ncompensation\nfor 2024.\nIn a separate announcement, Clark said the company would maximize returns by selling assets and reinvesting capital into high-yielding assets and share repurchases. During the latest\nearnings\n, the company said it had no planned purchases, only dispositions, a change from its buy-happy days.\nThe company said it would add a new independent director by the end of the year, too. Any guesses? Either way, shares of the $10 billion, typically vanilla-REIT, rose on the news.\nReversal behind Hudson Pac reverse split?\nIn other publicly traded, real estate investment trust news: Studio and office owner Hudson Pacific Properties announced a board-approved 1-for-7 reverse stock split that\u2019ll take effect Dec. 1.\nReverse stock splits consolidate the number of existing shares into fewer, higher-priced shares and are sometimes done to avoid being delisted \u2014 but the company\u2019s shares are trading under $2 per share, with the $1 mark a red flag for delisting.

The Downtown Los Angeles property, at 333 South Grand Avenue, includes a 54-story office building, called the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower, along with a three-story retail asset called the Halo.\n(A sister South Tower is not included in the deal).\nThe roughly $506 million debt on the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower is in default, but how much the note would fetch, if it trades, is unclear. Eastdil shared no hints in the offering memorandum, nor did it say whether it was representing Brookfield or its lenders.\nBut the loan connected to EY Plaza, another Brookfield-owned Downtown Los Angeles office tower, now in a receiver\u2019s hands after debt default, may offer a clue.

        "content": "A\nMamdani\nequivalent in Los Angeles? Some are wondering with housing advocate\nRae Huang\nnow in the 2026 race for mayor.\nThe deputy director of affordable housing group Housing Now aims to unseat Karen Bass, with an agenda that isn\u2019t far off from a blend of the mayor\u2019s own 2021 campaign talking points and those of New York City mayor-elect\nZohran Mamdani\n.\nWhile the Los Angeles Times called the the Democratic Socialists of America member (she reportedly pays dues) a \u201clong shot,\u201d it\u2019s notable that Mamdani was a longshot democratic socialist when this year dawned, and another longshot with the same political pedigree, Katie Wilson, just got\nelected mayor of Seattle.\nAgainst that backdrop, Huang joins the mix at a time when talking up public housing and free bus rides have sometimes mobilized voters. Indeed, that\u2019s what she highlighted in her campaign launch video, calling Los Angeles \u201cstuck\u201d when it comes to housing, transit and affordability.\nThe self-described reverend and Sawtelle resident paints a broad brush when it comes to what she intends to tackle: lower rent, housing for all, an economy \u201cfor the people, not the billionaires,\u201d renewable energy, free transit, support for small business and public safety by bolstering mental health services.\nThat was all presented in the video against a montage of imagery that included Bass, the\nPalisades and Eaton fires\nand Downtown L.A.\u2019s biggest commercial black eye in the graffiti towers, AKA\nOceanwide Plaza\n.\nWhile Bass\u2019 No. 1 priority was homelessness at the time of her 2022 swearing in, Huang called the mayor\u2019s programs to date \u201cband-aid\u201d solutions. It\u2019s unclear what the mayoral hopeful\u2019s position is on\nMeasure United to House LA\n, the tax that\u2019s dogged commercial and residential real estate since going into effect in 2023.\n\u201cThe city is unaffordable, and our leaders are unaccountable,\u201d Huang offered.\nCity hall power struggles boil over\nThat last point of Huang\u2019s comment hits on a big headline from this week: accountability at L.A. City Hall.\nWhat\u2019s clearly an internal battle over who the heck is in charge of the rebuilding contracts spilled out into public view on Monday when Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez bluntly asked \u201cWho\u2019s calling the shots with\nAECOM\nand [the city\u2019s Bureau of Engineering]\u201d as Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery members considered whether to move $8 million to the BOE to pay the infrastructure and engineering firm as work gets completed around rebuilding-related strategies.\nRodriguez\u2019 disbelief that spending is happening so loosely with nothing much to show for it as the one-year mark for the Palisades and Eaton fires nears was palpable as she cried \u201cbullshit\u201d over the city\u2019s numerous \u201cfalse starts\u201d in getting homes rebuilt. She offered that Bass\u2019 office \u201ctotally botched the first few months of this recovery,\u201d first tapping a chief recovery officer in\nSteve Soboroff\n, whose clashes with the mayor\u2019s office were well publicized. Then there was a contract with Illinois-based disaster recovery firm\nHagerty Consulting\nthat drew the ire of some Palisades residents who wondered what the company was doing and for how much.\nBass\u2019 office dismissed the latest condemnations.\n\u201cWhile some in the city criticize without providing solutions, Mayor Bass remains focused on leading the fastest disaster recovery effort in modern California history and on getting families home \u2014 full stop,\u201d a spokesperson from the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nOn Measure ULA\nBass\u2019 idea to have the city council pass an ordinance that would allow for a one-time pause on\nMeasure ULA\nfor Palisades residential deals is inching forward.\nThe Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery approved a motion this week requesting the city attorney provide a report in the next 30 days on the feasibility of such a pause.\nThe proposed carveout would apply to single-family homes, condos and other residential properties. Commercial was left out of the discussion with the aim of the pause to \u201ccreate more housing citywide.\u201d The one-time exemption would be good only for a three-year period.\nThe effort would seem to address attempts by Traci Park, who represents the Palisades on the city council and also chairs the recovery committee, to have ULA funds funneled to renters who lost their homes from the fire or to workers who lost their jobs as a result of the fire and could not pay for housing. Park said she was told amendments to ULA, a 2022 ballot measure, could only be handled at the ballot box.\nULA was passed as a means of funding affordable housing and to prevent homelessness with tenant rights education, rental assistance and other programs. Why fire survivors facing housing instability would not qualify for such funds under ULA\u2019s current $425 million budget is unclear.\n",

        "content": "Companies can often represent a mirror of their leaders. Understand the top executive, and you\u2019ll have a better chance to understand the why and how of the organization beneath.\nSo, changes at the top create some intrigue, as is the case for Related California, a subsidiary of the dominant Related Companies and one of the state\u2019s most prolific developers. This week, The Real Deal\u2019s Lauren Elkies-Schram\nbroke the story\nthat Bill Witte, Related California\u2019s chairman and CEO, planned to step down.\nFor more than 35 years, Witte, 74, led the once-upstart Related California and its development of tens of thousands of new housing units \u2014 a portfolio worth several billion dollars \u2014 across the state. To continue his work,\nWitte has tapped two successors\n: company president Gino Canori and in-house affordable housing executive Ann Silverberg. Canori is based in San Francisco and will become president and CEO of Related California\u2019s market rate and mixed-income development group. Silverberg will take over as president and CEO of all affordable housing work.\nSometimes succession plans don\u2019t work out, as evidenced this week by the news that Victor MacFarlane has returned as CEO of the development firm he founded, MacFarlane Partners. MacFarlane, now 74, had stepped down in 2022 from the San Francisco-based company, which the\nSan Francisco Business Times called\n\u201cone of the first and largest Black-owned real estate development firms in the country.\u201d MacFarlane thought he had a succession plan in place, handing the keys and his legacy over to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Landon Taylor.\nAccording to the Business Times, Taylor struggled to \u201cpursue business opportunities without MacFarlane\u2019s involvement.\u201d Taylor is now starting up his own company, LegacyFirst, which will reportedly work with MacFarlane Partners to complete Freedom West, a $2.3 billion megaproject in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore neighborhood envisioned to have more than 2,000 new housing units, a hotel, and commercial space. Momentum on the project\nhas slowed in recent years\n, and MacFarlane told The Real Deal the focus is on entitling the property for the development.\nRegarding succession plans for MacFarlane Partners, MacFarlane, 74, told The Real Deal he has none, and that he now hopes to wrap up the firm before he turns 80.\nWhat hasn\u2019t slowed in San Francisco is the artificial intelligence agency\u2019s grip on commercial real estate. Earlier this week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Nvidia, the multi-trillion-dollar chip manufacturer,\nleased 45,000 square feet at the Mission Rock project,\nwhere they\u2019ll be neighbors with Visa, Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors. Nvidia has largely taken up space in Silicon Valley but now stake out a presence in OpenAI\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood.\nUp around the Embarcadero, OpenAI rival Anthropic, creator of the large-language-model Claude, is reportedly finalizing a long-term lease at 300 Howard Street.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n, the lease terms could be as long as 13 years, and \u201cwould involve the company taking over the entire 420,000-square-foot building.\u201d The building was previously leased to FitBit.\nSuch a lengthy lease would fly in the face of\nthe city\u2019s recent trends.\nYes, high-end office leases are flying off the charts, but many leases are for three-to-five years \u2014 terms which provide necessary flexibility for young companies to grow fast, but add a layer of long-term uncertainty to the local office market.\n",

        "content": "A familiar face made a big move last week with the $140 million purchase of 11 storefronts on Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road.\nMichael Comras\u2019 Comras Company\nplans to redevelop the properties\ninto a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi \u2014 short for North Lincoln Road.\nIn 2015, the retail developer and broker sold 1001-1035 Lincoln Road for $370 million. The buyer was Pontegadea, the family office of Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega.\nNow Comras is back in a big way. He has scooped up nearly a dozen storefronts, mostly along the 700 and 800 blocks of Lincoln Road. Current tenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery on Lincoln Lane. Comras is designing NoLi as a pedestrian retail experience, lined with boutique storefronts and cafes with outdoor seating and centered around a fountain and landscaping.\nHis investment is another sign of the next era for Lincoln Road. Record rents ($150 to $300 per square foot) set years ago resulted in record vacancies, and a number of storefronts sit empty.\u00a0 National tenants have moved onto competing neighborhoods like the Miami Design District and Wynwood. Even the movie theater shuttered.\nAs investor and developer Scott Sherman\nput it in an interview\nlast month, \u201cthe street lost its energy.\u201d\nBut landlords and brokers suggest that the doom-and-gloom narrative will soon be in the past.\nSherman returned to the street last year after nearly a decade, and paid $10.4 million for a property that\u2019s leased to the clothing store AllSaints. Now that rents have come down, \u201cthe street\u2019s affordable enough for creative operators to come back,\u201d he said.\nBroker Stephen DeMeo agreed about the need for creativity. The street, she said, \u201cneeds activation \u2014 pop-up stores, rooftop events, wellness studios [and] cultural tie-ins.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat\u2019s Miami Mayor Francis Suarez\u2019 next move?

Miami-based developer Nouri Group sold the house to reality star\nSam Logan\n.\nCommercial:\nBillionaire Citadel founder\nKen Griffin sold\nthe 48,600-square-foot former Neiman Marcus building at 151 Worth Avenue in Palm Beach for $80.5 million to West Palm Beach-based TZ Capital.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nFormer Manalapan Mayor Stewart Satter, a spec developer who made his fortune in the consumer testing industry, re-listed his property in the town\nfor $75 million.\nThe 4-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal lot at 1960 South Ocean Boulevard in Manalapan is listed with Nick Malinosky of The Exclusive Group at Douglas Elliman. Earlier this year, Satter announced plans to develop a spec mansion on the property, listed for $285 million. Now he\u2019s listing the land, with plans for the 55,000-square-foot estate. Satter paid $27.5 million for the ocean-to-Intracoastal Waterway property last year.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMiami commissioners deferred a vote on a Watson Island land sale to their Dec. 11 meeting. The Motwani family\u2019s Merrimac Ventures and BH3 plan to develop a plot on the south side of the island into a mixed-use project with a condo component. At a meeting last week, Merrimac\u2019s Nitin Motwani said the local joke that the island is cursed \u201cfeels more and more real every day because it\u2019s been three years now, and every time we\u2019re making two steps forward, we end up making three steps back.\u201d\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposal to open a large stretch of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast to offshore drilling drew opposition from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who cited a 2020 Trump memo that protects the coast until 2032, the\nTallahassee Democrat\nreports.\nFlorida Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was indicted on charges that she and her brother diverted a $5 million FEMA overpayment to secretly fund her congressional campaign, according to the\nNew York Times\n. Cherfilus-McCormick represents Florida\u2019s 20th Congressional District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties.\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidential library foundation plans to raise nearly $1 billion in tax-exempt donations over the next two years for a high-rise library in downtown Miami, according to the\nMiami Herald\n. That amount is nearly 50 times what Barack Obama\u2019s library raised in its first three years.",

The building is at the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and San Vicente Boulevard, just south of a stretch of Wilshire Boulevard known as Museum Row for the cluster of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Peterson Automotive Museum and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. You can see the top 10 multifamily sales in L.A. by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller of the property on Fairfax was Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alliance Residential, led by CEO V. Jay Hiemenz. It completed the five-story property in 2018, with $68.8 million in construction costs on top of the value of the land \u2014 which appears to point to a loss on the sale.\nVinz on Fairfax has 144 studio, one- and two-bedrooms unit apartments, putting the sale price at roughly $475,000 per unit. The building totals 120,381 square feet, per\nLoopNet\n, with 4,100 square feet of street-level commercial space..\nRents on studios start at $2,620 per month; a one-bedroom starts at $3,333 a month; and a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit starts at $3,932, per listings for available units on the property\u2019s website. Building amenities include a swimming pool, a fitness center and covered parking.\nThis sale marked Seminole Real Estate Fund\u2019s first California buy. Financing included a $36.5 million loan from Northwestern Mutual,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nThe Seminole Tribe established the fund in 2020 with a focus on multifamily investments. It owns 12 additional properties scattered across the country, from Issaquah, Washington, to Washington, D.C.The second- and fourth-priciest multifamily transactions in the first nine months of the year comprise a two-building student housing portfolio near the University of Southern California, which sold for $100 million.

The old headquarters site is home to the Alo Gym and a content studio.\nBreevast U.S., the American offshoot of Dutch investment firm Breevast, was the seller of the three-story La Peer Building. Breevast\nbought the building in 2019\nfor $107.5 million. The sale to Alo marks a 16 percent discount from the previous sale price, but the transaction is still the second-pricest of the year in Beverly Hills.\nThe office market in the ritzy Los Angeles-area city has faced increasing office demand and limited construction, driving down the vacancy rate from 17 percent a year ago to 15 percent. The broader Los Angeles office market is unstable, but the purchase by Alo is the latest transaction in Beverly Hills to buck that trend.\nLast year,\nFashion Nova bought\nthe 175,000-square-foot building nearby at 407 North Maple Drive from Tishman Speyer for $118 million, or $676 per square foot, for its headquarters.\nIn September, Kilroy Realty bought the 290,000-square-foot building at 345 North Maple Drive for $205 million, or $707 per square foot, making it one of the priciest deals of the year in the Los Angeles area. That same month, a\nCorinthia Hotels affiliate bought the office building\nat 9800 Wilshire Boulevard and an adjacent parking structure for $100 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a significant drought in investments for a while, but this deal is a sign we\u2019re turning a corner,\u201d Madison Partners founder and president Bob Safai, who represented Breevast in the deal, told the outlet. \u201cBeverly Hills is always an attraction for high-end investors because they see it as safe in good and bad markets.\u201d\nLa Peer Building has been vacant since 2022 when\nParadigm Talent Agency\nleft the property. Alo\u2019s timeline for moving into the building has not been disclosed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Companies can often represent a mirror of their leaders. Understand the top executive, and you\u2019ll have a better chance to understand the why and how of the organization beneath.\nSo, changes at the top create some intrigue, as is the case for Related California, a subsidiary of the dominant Related Companies and one of the state\u2019s most prolific developers. This week,\nThe Real Deal\n\u2018s Lauren Elkies-Schram\nbroke the story\nthat Bill Witte, Related California\u2019s chairman and CEO, planned to step down.\nFor more than 35 years, Witte, 74, led the once-upstart Related California and its development of tens of thousands of new housing units \u2014 a portfolio worth several billion dollars \u2014 across the state. To continue his work,\nWitte has tapped two successors\n: company president Gino Canori and in-house affordable housing executive Ann Silverberg. Canori is based in San Francisco and will become president and CEO of Related California\u2019s market rate and mixed-income development group. Silverberg will take over as president and CEO of all affordable housing work.\nSometimes succession plans don\u2019t work out, as evidenced this week by the news that Victor MacFarlane has returned as CEO of the development firm he founded, MacFarlane Partners. MacFarlane, now 74, had stepped down in 2022 from the San Francisco-based company, which the\nSan Francisco Business Times called\n\u201cone of the first and largest Black-owned real estate development firms in the country.\u201d MacFarlane thought he had a succession plan in place, handing the keys and his legacy over to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Landon Taylor.\nAccording to the Business Times, Taylor struggled to \u201cpursue business opportunities without MacFarlane\u2019s involvement.\u201d Taylor is now starting up his own company, LegacyFirst, which will reportedly work with MacFarlane Partners to complete Freedom West, a $2.3 billion megaproject in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore neighborhood envisioned to have more than 2,000 new housing units, a hotel, and commercial space. Momentum on the project\nhas slowed in recent years\n, and MacFarlane told\nTRD\nthe focus is on entitling the property for the development.\nRegarding succession plans for MacFarlane Partners, MacFarlane, 74, told\nTRD\nhe has none, and that he now hopes to wrap up the firm before he turns 80.\nWhat hasn\u2019t slowed in San Francisco is the artificial intelligence agency\u2019s grip on commercial real estate. Earlier this week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Nvidia, the multi-trillion-dollar chip manufacturer,\nleased 45,000 square feet at the Mission Rock project,\nwhere they\u2019ll be neighbors with Visa, Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors. Nvidia has largely taken up space in Silicon Valley but now stake out a presence in OpenAI\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood.\nUp around the Embarcadero, OpenAI rival Anthropic, creator of the large-language-model Claude, is reportedly finalizing a long-term lease at 300 Howard Street.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n, the lease terms could be as long as 13 years, and \u201cwould involve the company taking over the entire 420,000-square-foot building.\u201d The building was previously leased to FitBit.\nSuch a lengthy lease would fly in the face of\nthe city\u2019s recent trends.\nYes, high-end office leases are flying off the charts, but many leases are for three-to-five years \u2014 terms which provide necessary flexibility for young companies to grow fast, but add a layer of long-term uncertainty to the local office market.\n",

        "content": "A Winnetka home sold for a record-breaking $32.5 million in an off-market transaction last week.\nThe sale at 609 Sheridan Road in Winnetka comes near the end of a record-setting year for the highest end of luxury real estate in the North Shore. It\u2019s the most expensive home sale ever recorded in Chicagoland, breaking the previous record of $31.3 million for a\nWinnetka home in August\n.\nThe sale was not recorded in public listing channels, but a Cook County deed recorded Nov. 19 shows the property changed hands for $32.5 million. It was bought and sold under land trusts that obscured the identities of the parties. Because the sale was off-market, the records do not show the real estate agents involved with the deal.\nJena Radnay of @properties Christies International Real Estate brokered the August record-breaker and has been involved in many of the top\nWinnetka sales\nthis year.\nThe Real Deal\ncontacted Radnay about the most recent sale, and she declined to comment.\nThe most recent listing information for the home shows it had five bedrooms and four bathrooms, but satellite images show the home was likely rebuilt since that listing. It was last sold in 2013 for $8 million, and it was listed for sale in 2014 for $10.5 million with @properties, listing portals show. When the home was last listed, it was advertised as a potential teardown.\nThe home sits on about 1.6 acres and had 11,000 square-feet of living space when it was last listed.\nThis is a developing story.\n",

        "content": "Colin Fitzgibbons, president of Hunt Realty Investments and a rising force in North Texas real estate whose career touched some of the region\u2019s most transformative projects, died unexpectedly at 46, leaving behind a deep imprint on Dallas\u2019 development landscape and the colleagues he led.\nThe company did not release a cause of death, though two people close to him told the Dallas Morning News who first\nreported\nhis passing Nov. 21 that he died from complications related to cancer. In a statement, Hunt Realty CEO Chris Kleinert called Fitzgibbons a singular leader whose loyalty, intellect and self-deprecating humor powered the investment firm through a slate of high-impact projects.\nA Dallas native, Fitzgibbons straddled journalism and real estate before choosing the latter. His mother, Ruth Fitzgibbons, was a longtime D Magazine editor, while his father, Jay Fitzgibbons, ran JSC Realty and developed industrial sites across the region. Fitzgibbons tried the newsroom first, working as a sports reporter at The Washington Post, then pivoted to commercial real estate at the\nStaubach Company\nin New York.\nHe returned to Dallas for graduate school at SMU, earning an MBA that propelled him into KDC in 2010. There, he helped steer some of the metroplex\u2019s most ambitious developments: Richardson\u2019s 186-acre, $1.5 billion\nCityLine\n, Plano\u2019s $3 billion Legacy West and Liberty Mutual\u2019s 1-million-square-foot regional hub. Fitzgibbons often said Legacy West was the project he was proudest of, writing on LinkedIn that he loved an industry where \u201cpeople are rewarded if they\u2019re willing to hustle.\u201d\nThat drive led him to Hunt Realty in 2020. Fitzgibbons said the chance to work on marquee developments in Frisco, Uptown and downtown Dallas sealed the deal, along with a seasoned bench he described as one of the firm\u2019s biggest draws. Hunt Realty \u2014 backed by the family of oil magnate H.L. Hunt \u2014 has long shaped the Dallas skyline, from its 1970s investment in the\nReunion project\nto its current role as a heavyweight source of capital.\nBeyond the office, Fitzgibbons was active with The Real Estate Council, NAIOP North Texas, SMU\u2019s Folsom Institute and the Oak Cliff YMCA, reflecting a civic streak that matched his professional ambition.\nHe is survived by his wife, Jessica, and their three sons.\nKleinert\ntold the outlet that Fitzgibbons\u2019 influence at Hunt would endure far beyond his six years at the company, adding that his devotion to family guided how he showed up for colleagues and partners alike.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Sale prices fell more in Dallas/Fort Worth than in any other U.S. metro over a recent four-week run that the\nnational median price\nrose.\nDuring the four weeks ending Nov. 16, the median home sale price declined 3.9 percent from a year earlier in Fort Worth, the largest drop out of any of the nation\u2019s 50 most populous cities, according to\nRedfin\n. At the same time, the median U.S. sale price rose 2.3 percent year over year.\nDallas tied with Jacksonville, Florida, for second place with a decline of 3.3 percent.\nFort Worth is leading a big pack. While the median home sale price increased nationally, it decreased in 18 of the 50 top cities, the most in over two years.\nNew home sales might be applying downward pressure on the resale segment, Dave Bowman, head of the Southlake-based brokerage Century 21 Mike Bowman, speculated.\n\u201c\nThe builders\nare going to make deals, period. Now, they\u2019re not going to go broke doing it. But\nthey\u2019re offering buyers incentives now\n; they have to. Whereas a seller, if they don\u2019t have to sell, they\u2019re not as highly motivated,\u201d Bowman said.\nWhile prices are lower than Fort Worth\u2019s last market peak in 2022, they\u2019re still well above pre-pandemic levels, Bowman observed.\n\u201cThe big COVID boom was an anomaly of itself. I never saw price appreciation like that, and I\u2019ve been doing this almost 40 years,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting back now to where we were before.\u201d\nThe median Fort Worth-area home sold for $354,000 in October, according to Redfin. That\u2019s $30,000 less than the median price in June 2022 but $88,000 more than January 2021.\nOn the other end of the scale, the top five cities with the biggest year-over-year increases were clustered in the Rust Belt. Cincinnati had the widest leap in sale prices at 10.5 percent, followed by Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee and Cleveland.\nAll metros in the Texas Triangle \u2014 the region defined by Interstates 10, 45 and 35, cornered at DFW, Houston and San Antonio \u2014 have surpassed the rest of the country in varying measures of the\nbuyer\u2019s market shift\nthis year. San Antonio led the nation in\ncanceled home purchases\nin July. Dallas and Houston had the highest shares of\ndiscounted sales\nin the country in August. Houston and Austin tied for the greatest\ndecrease in median home prices\nnationally in September. Austin had the\nhighest ratio of sellers to buyers\nin October, and it suffered the\ngreatest loss in average home value\naccording to Zillow in November.Austin also posted the\nlargest decrease in median price\nfor the third quarter, according to TRD Data.\n",

        "content": "Multifamily distress\nhas been simmering all year for Lurin Capital, and it\u2019s reaching a boiling point with founder Jon Venetos getting slapped with new lawsuits on a near-weekly cycle.\nIn the latest for the troubled apartment landlord, lender\nVista Bank joined Acore in the hunt for Venetos\nover personal guaranties. Vista sued Venetos, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex.\nThere\u2019s a fraud element to Vista\u2019s accusation, too. In the suit, the lender accused Venetos of \u201cattempting to obtain credit at another financial institution using false, altered, or fraudulent account statements of Vista.\u201d\nThat makes two lenders going after Venetos for debt remaining after the foreclosure process. Acore is asking for\nan $81 million judgment\nrelated to a $394 million loan tied to properties in Florida and Texas.\nSince the end of October, Venetos has been hit with a\nlawsuit from Fannie Mae\n, accusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex. While some floundering multifamily investors can blame distress on interest rate hikes and floating-rate loans, that\u2019s not the case with this debt, which had a fixed rate of 5.1 percent. Plus, Lurin is on the receiving end of a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nThe list of aggrieved parties is adding up; lenders and investors want their money back, and residents of the aging apartments Lurin still owns are forced to make do in the properties left to waste.\nHard times for Harwood\nHarwood International was dealt\nanother critical blow\n. Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm was trying to hold together its office empire until its next project, Harwood No. 15, could be built. The nationally prominent law firm Jones Day, which occupies 133,000 square feet of another Harwood building and was set to anchor the new project, according to several sources.\nThe news is the latest rough patch in a tough year for the Uptown landlord, which has faced three recent office building foreclosures and lost two properties to lenders so far.\nAustin\u2019s other side\nTexas has seen a sharp downturn in home valuations, and\nAustin\nis leading the pack. The former tech boomtown, which had meteoric growth during the pandemic, has suffered a 20 percent decline in home values, according to Zillow\u2019s Zestimate function. The rest of the Texas Triangle hasn\u2019t fared well either. The top five cities for home valuation losses include Austin, San Antonio and Dallas.\nAnother look at Tesla deal\nNot sure if the dip in home values has folks in Travis County, home of Austin, getting cranky over its deal with Elon Musk, but the locals are\nholding up Tesla\u2019s tax incentives\n. The EV giant has paid $19 million in county property taxes since 2021; per a 2020 agreement, it\u2019s eligible for rebates of up to 80 percent. However, the agreement caps the percentage of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers \u2014 contractors and temporary staff \u2014 Tesla can count toward its job totals. For the first decade of the contract, just 30 percent of qualifying full-time roles can be held by contingent workers. Tesla, however, is refusing the provide that information.\nSharp sense of history\nA Houston home\nonce owned by fraudster Frank Sharp\nsold after asking double the price of its last trade. The 11,200-square-foot mansion at 2307 River Oaks Boulevard was last listed for $16 million. The seller, steel magnate Daniel Benditz, bought the property in 2015 when it was asking $7.9 million. Until 1984, the home belonged to Sharp, the developer behind the Oak Forest neighborhood and Sharpstown, the city\u2019s first master-planned subdivision. He was found guilty of a stock fraud scheme that brought down several prominent Texas politicians in the 1970s.\nSaks says downtown Neiman to stay put for now\nIn February, Saks Global gave the Neiman Marcus flagship store in downtown Dallas just weeks to live. A coalition of downtown stakeholders put up a fight to\npreserve the historic store\n, prompting Saks to change its prognosis and allow the store to stay open until the end of the year. Saks announced\nthe store will stay open\npast the new year as discussions continue about the fate of the building.\nKazakh firm hits Houston\nKazakh developer\nBI Group is making its debut\nin Houston. The North American arm of the firm based in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital Asana is partnering with local firm Vita Group to build The Winford, a 26-unit for-sale townhome project at 5821 Winsome Lane. BI Group\u2019s first Texas project follows its launch of two projects in Miami.\n",

The buyer secured a $40 million loan from City National Bank of Florida.\nCompleted in 1987 on a 2.9-acre lot, One Clearlake spans about 221,700 square feet and\u00a0 includes an attached four-story, 669-space garage, according to records. Roughly 20 percent of the office space is available for lease, according to a Related Ross spokesperson.\nTenants include Northwestern Mutual, Ideal Nutrition, RM Anderson Co., SouthState Loan Office and Rubenstein Law.\nThe purchase marks at least Related Ross\u2019 11th office property in downtown West Palm, including those purchased, developed, under construction and planned.\nThe tower is adjacent to the two-story, 70,100-square-foot WPTV studio and office building at 1100 Banyan Boulevard, which Related Ross bought for\n$40 million\nin May.\nThe One Clearlake and WPTV sites now give Related Ross a combined 7.6 contiguous acres facing Clear Lake.\nAny potential redevelopment would have to wait because The E.W. Scripps Company, WPTV\u2019s parent company, leased back its building for a term of at least two and a half years.\nThis is the second time One Clearlake traded this year. In May, Bradford Allen bought it for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from its sale price four years ago. The sellers \u2013 Rockpoint and New England Development, both based in Boston, Miami-based Tricera, and Palm Beach-based NDT Development \u2013\u2013 had paid\n$60.7 million\nfor One Clearlake in 2021.\nRoss, 85, founded New York-based Related Companies over 50 years ago. After leading the firm that helped shape New York\u2019s skyline, he stepped back last year, carved out Related\u2019s Southeast division and put it under his newly founded\nRelated Ross\n. Related Ross primarily focuses on downtown West Palm and also on other South Florida areas.\nThis year, Related Ross completed the 25-story\nOne Flagler\nat the foot of the Royal Palm Bridge. It\u2019s also developing the\n10 CityPlace and 15 CityPlace\noffice towers on the site of AMC West Palm Beach 12 at 545 Hibiscus Street, and at the closed Brio Italian Grille at 550 South Rosemary Avenue.\nAside from offices, Related Ross also has built apartments and is developing condos in downtown West Palm. The firm\u2019s portfolio includes the CityPlace mixed-use complex that Related Companies completed in 2000.\nRoss\n, a major benefactor in Palm Beach County, has played a role in the county\u2019s reinvention. The billionaire has tapped his New York network to lease up his West Palm offices with financial firms, aligning with county boosters\u2019 yearslong push to turn the county into \u201cWall Street South.\u201d More recently, he has talked about attracting tech firms, in a bid to create \u201cSilicon Valley South\u201d in Palm Beach County. He also supported Vanderbilt University\u2019s plan to open a campus in West Palm.\nRoss remains nonexecutive chairman and the biggest single shareholder at Related Companies.\n",

It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 196 days on the market, on average.\nFifty-seven luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,294 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 15 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $100.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the dozen single-family homes and nine condos under contract last week totals $179 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $8.7 million and spent an average of 114 days on the market. They total $104.5 million in asking dollar volume.\nProperty records show spec developer\nMohammed Hussain sold\nthe 10,000-plus-square-foot Belle Meade mansion to Logan, who was a cast member on MTV\u2019s \u201cSiesta Key,\u201d a reality show set in Sarasota that filmed from 2017 to 2023. The 0.4-acre property at 905 Belle Meade Island Drive was on the market for $25 million, and the sale was entered in the Multiple Listing Service last week, at the same time the deed was recorded.

        "content": "The owners of San Francisco\u2019s biggest mall are kindly telling tenants to take a hike, signaling the beginning of the property\u2019s last days as a functioning shopping center.\nThe few remaining retailers at\nSan Francisco Centre\nhave received notices from mall management\u2019s legal counsel ordering them to \u201cimmediately vacate and surrender the premises\u201d and that their leases were \u201cextinguished\u201d by a recent ownership change, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. Last possible days of operation range from Dec. 31 to Jan. 31.\nSan Francisco Centre\u2019s imminent demise comes after a\nforeclosure auction\nlast week shifted control of the 5.9-acre, two-building complex to a mortgage trust owed nearly $600 million by previous owners Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties. The pair defaulted and abandoned its ownership post in 2023. The mall\u2019s new owner is an LLC known as DBJPM 2016-SFC Emporium.\nThe trust, advised by special servicer Midland Loan Servicing, was the only one to submit a minimum bid of $133 million, or 70 percent of the property\u2019s assessed value of roughly $195 million,\nper\nthe Business Times. The sales price was a far cry from the more than $1.2 billion value the property boasted in 2016.\nTenants have been voluntarily\nfleeing San Francisco Centre in droves\nover the past two years. Occupancy collapsed to roughly 9 percent after Nordstrom and Bloomingdale\u2019s walked away from their anchor leases at the shopping center in 2023 and earlier this year, respectively, helping trigger a cascade of store closures. Only two restaurants remain open after several\nrestaurants and retailers closed this summer\n.\nCBRE has been tapped to market the 1.2-million-square-foot property for sale, and a sales brochure is framing the site as a chance to transform the existing structure or pursue a large-scale mixed-use redevelopment on Market Street. It\ncan\u2019t, however, be turned into housing\nin its current form, as nine of the shopping center\u2019s floors don\u2019t get enough sunlight legally required for new housing units.\nBy emptying out a retail property this large, with few profitable tenants inside, the mall\u2019s owners could lower the daily operating cost of maintaining the site, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. At the same time, prospective buyers would have a clean slate to do whatever they want with the mall. JLL is staying on as the manager of the property under its new ownership.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

He sang the same tune at an\nevent\nThe Real Deal\nand his firm put on in Downtown Austin in October.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t sell them, fucking kick the keys back,\u201d he said.\nThe real estate investor and CEO of Rastagar Capital may have to do just that, as he is facing foreclosure on the four properties tied to a $22.7 million loan from Greystone, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The debt works out to $139,263 per unit.\nThe loan is backed by Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender,\u201d a dispute he plans to continue litigating even if he loses the properties. He added that the properties are such a small percentage of his portfolio.\nHe\u2019s focusing on the firm\u2019s high-profile projects, like\nInfinity Square\n, a 318-acre master-planned community between Austin and San Antonio in Kyle. At full build-out, Infinity Square will have 1,000 single-family homes and 1,400 apartments. He secured a\n$31.7 million construction loan\nfrom Trez Capital for the project in 2024.\nRastegar also said Class C apartments in Austin have been \u201cannihilated by the market.\u201d\nAustin has been flooded with a historic glut of multifamily deliveries in the last few years. Deliveries peaked in 2024, and Rent Cafe predicts the city will see 26,715 units delivered by the end of this year, a 5 percent drop from 2024.\nThe apartment oversupply has put a downward pressure on rents, which have fallen so much that it\u2019s become the most affordable city in the country for renters, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said at a\nTexas multifamily conference\nthis summer.\nEven in the face of foreclosure, Rastegar appears to be maintaining his cool. \u201cThis is part of the business, dude.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Property owners and brokers fear a four-letter acronym that, until recently, seemed a long-shot item on progressive wishlists: COPA.\nIf passed, the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act would give nonprofits approved by the city the first opportunity to buy buildings with three or more residential units.\nIt was first introduced in 2021, and the City Council has held multiple hearings on the measure,\nmost recently\nin June. Last week, however, the bill was on a list of measures set to age, meaning it would be eligible for a Council vote.\nIt was ultimately pulled from that list and is being negotiated between the bill\u2019s sponsor, Council member Sandy Nurse and the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation.\nThe bill\u2019s movement has some real estate professionals spooked. Broker Bob Knakal\nsounded the alarm\non social media platform X last week, warning that the City Council \u201cdropped a bomb on the multifamily market.\u201d (In his thread, Knakal incorrectly claimed the bill had passed a preliminary vote.) He and others argue that the rules would disrupt the city\u2019s housing market by tying up inventory and scaring investors away.\nNurse is expected to introduce amendments to the bill, though as of Friday, the potential changes on the table appeared to be minimal, according to one source familiar with negotiations.\nMultifamily \u201cbomb\u201d\nUnder COPA, owners looking to sell their buildings would need to notify HPD at least 180 days before moving forward with such plans. They also need to provide the agency with various records, including a detailed income and expense report for the past year.\nThen a \u201cqualified entity\u201d \u2014\u00a0defined as nonprofits on HPD\u2019s\nQualified Preservation Buyers List\nor community land trusts, which are committed to providing housing affordable to low- to extremely-low income tenants \u2014\u00a0has 60 days to submit a notice that they intend to bid on the property. The qualified entity has 120 days from the owner\u2019s notice to HPD to make an offer.\u00a0 During that time, the owner cannot accept other offers, giving the qualified entity time to match any other bids.\nDelayed closings can make it harder to line up financing and get title insurance. Injecting uncertainty into these deals would deter investors and lenders, opponents say.\n\u201cIt will slow transactions dramatically,\u201d said Matt Cosentino, who leads multifamily sales at Brooklyn-based brokerage TerraCRG. \u201cA lot of the owners that we deal with are smaller, so-called mom and pop owners, who don\u2019t necessarily have time to waste.\u201d\nSuch rules also preclude 1031 exchanges, he said. These deals, which allow a real estate investor to defer capital gains from the sale of one property by investing that profit into a similar property, must close within a 180-day window.\nFor some, the mere concept of the city getting involved in these transactions is anathema.\n\u201cThe idea of having to tell your government that you are selling your property seems like the most basic, un-American idea,\u201d Cosentino said.\nDeveloper Humberto Lopes called the bill \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described its requirements as an unfair steering to a specific kind of buyer.\n\u201cWhat gives you the right to supersede everybody?\u201d he asked.\nProponents of the bill say it will help curb speculation and level the playing field for nonprofits to bid on properties.\nLast year, East New York Community Land Trust bought a 21-unit, rent-stabilized apartment at 248 Arlington Avenue for $3 million. The group was able to do so without COPA, but Hannah Anousheh, director of the East New York Community Land Trust, said the bill will help pave the way for deals where the landlord is not willing to negotiate with tenants or nonprofits.\nThe East New York Community Land Trust is working with the building\u2019s tenants to convert their units to co-ops. In this arrangement, the group will maintain ownership of the land and the building is leased to the co-op, where prices are kept at a certain level.\n\u201cThis is about helping to bring tons of buildings under responsible ownership,\u201d Anousheh said.\nNational trend\nOther cities have implemented\nsimilar policies\n. In San Francisco, nonprofits have 30 days to act on their right of first refusal. Washington, D.C., is home to the nation\u2019s oldest Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, enacted in 1980, where a building\u2019s tenants are given the first crack at buying their building. Chicago is\npiloting\nits own version. The state legislature in New York has also proposed a version of TOPA.\nCritiques of these programs are similar to those raised around COPA in New York and led to\namendments\nto TOPA in Washington, D.C., this year. Still, since 2006, tens of thousands of D.C. units have been preserved as affordable as a result of TOPA, according to a 2023 report by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\nSupporters and even some critics of these policies agree that the success of COPA and TOPA programs hinges on nonprofits being able to tap into a steady stream of capital and tenants\u2019 ability to organize.\nSome of the owners who spoke to\nThe Real Deal\nabout COPA thought a pilot version that applied to a smaller pool of buildings, along a shorter window than 180 days, would potentially be workable.\nNurse would not comment on what amendments she is considering, but in a statement, said that her bill has the support of 33 other council members and 35 affordable housing providers.\n\u201cWe are in an affordability crisis in New York City and COPA gives us another tool to preserve and create more affordable housing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are thrilled to be engaging with many stakeholders to develop a program that helps us address the housing crisis.\u201d\nJay Martin, executive vice president of the New York Apartment Association, called the bill\u2019s scope \u201cridiculous\u201d and said few nonprofits are in a position to buy buildings, especially those that require extensive renovations.\n\u201cAnother buyer into the market isn\u2019t the problem. It is that the resources needed to buy the buildings aren\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s also a question of whether HPD\u2019s staff will be overwhelmed as the intermediary in these deals.\nDuring the June\nhearing\n, HPD echoed that concern, recommending that the program be narrowly tailored to the distressed buildings to avoid administrative challenges and negative impacts to the housing market.\nAgency spokesperson Matt Rauschenbach said on Friday that HPD remains \u201cengaged\u201d with Nurse.\n\u201cWhen legislation is proposed that may significantly impact the housing landscape, we are committed to providing input and feedback to ensure that all potential effects are fully evaluated and considered,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThese negotiations are happening as the industry also tries to fend off a\nbill\nthat would set minimum construction wages for housing projects with 100 or more units that receive $1 million or more in public financing. The Council is also considering a\ntrio of bills\nthat would set minimum thresholds for the percentage of two- and three-room apartments in city-funded projects, cap the percentage of studio apartments in senior housing and mandate that a minimum percentage of city-funded housing is affordable to very and extremely low-income tenants.\nOne affordable housing developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, posited that the City Council, in the final weeks of the Adams administration, is trying to reclaim oversight over housing in the city, after voters approved ballot measures that weaken its authority over certain land use actions.\n\u201cOverall, they just keep making it harder to do business in New York City,\u201d the developer said. \u201cWe are at a point where the city council and certain advocates are viewing investors as a negative.\u201d\n",

Architecture firm CetraRuddy, which has become a go-to for office-to-residential conversions across the city, is leading the redesign.\nAbramson Brothers has owned the building since around the time of its founding in 1957. This will be the firm\u2019s first office-to-residential conversion.\nPlans call for ground-floor retail and parking, while the bulk of the 1928 building is slated to become apartments. The lower level will include a co-working space. Amenities include a fitness center and terrace.\nAdam Abramson, who is listed as the applicant on the filing, said he plans to use the\n467m tax incentive program\n, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting outdated office buildings into apartments. He declined to comment further on the project, saying they are early in the process. The plans were first reported by PincusCo.\nThe project adds to a growing roster of conversions in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Midtown West, where smaller office footprints and fluctuating demand have pushed landlords toward residential conversions. Older mid-rise buildings like 333 West 52nd Street have emerged as prime candidates for redevelopment.\nNearby, Yellowstone Real Estate Investments is\nconverting the 600-key Watson Hotel\nin Hell\u2019s Kitchen into a 249-unit apartment building. Isaac Hera\u2019s firm is also planning\na 422-unit conversion\nof a Midtown West office building at 1730 Broadway.\nMadigan Development\nis converting a 12-story Midtown property at 45 West 55th Street into a 17-story residential building that will feature 42 units.\n",

A JLL team including Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara and Drew Isaacson arranged the transaction.\nMadison Realty picked up the property less than two years ago from Jeffrey Wu\u2019s Flushing Landmark Realty\nfor $80 million\n. The property was one of several covered by mezzanine loans obtained by Wu, who has been dealing with bankruptcy proceedings across his real estate empire for years.\nXu did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, so his plans for the property are unclear.

        "content": "You might have heard that landlords are\ngoing crazy\nabout COPA.\nWord is spreading that the City Council aims to reduce rents by giving nonprofits an exclusive window to buy apartment buildings before profiteers can.\nCouncil members are close to voting on a bill from Sandy Nurse called the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act.\nIf COPA is a good idea, why not apply the same logic to things besides housing? After all, the affordability problem is also about food, clothing, energy and other necessities.\nTake supermarkets, for example. These profit-seeking institutions buy food from wholesalers, then mark up the prices so they can make a profit. Outrageous, right?\nSupermarkets\u2019 profit margins\nrange from 1 percent to as high as 3 percent. No wonder so many New Yorkers go hungry!\nAs socialists repeatedly tell us, profit makes things more expensive for consumers. The official slogan of the New York City tenants group Metropolitan Council on Housing is \u201c\nhousing for people, not profit\n.\u201d\nSo, to make food cheaper, I propose COPA for Groceries. Let\u2019s call it COPA-G.\nHere\u2019s the plan: Before farmers or manufacturers sell food to a store, restaurant, catering business or food cart, they would have to notify nonprofits of the opportunity to purchase it.\nSoup kitchens and other charities would have an exclusive window to buy this food before the greedy capitalists do. When\nZohran Mamdani\nopens his four\ncity-run supermarkets\n, they could get in on the action.\nThe window would have to be shorter for fruit, vegetables, meat and other perishables so not too much of it spoils during the waiting period. For products with a long shelf life, such as cereal, nonprofits would have 120 days to put in their bids, just like with COPA for buildings.\nAre you with me? Cheap food, people!\nWith a good video from Mamdani\u2019s social media team and a door-knocking operation by the\nDemocratic Socialists of America\n, we could quickly build popular support for this idea.\nOnce the law takes effect and proof of concept is achieved, as it surely would be, we could expand it to other products. Nonprofit thrift shops could get six months to buy clothing and shoes from manufacturers before evil retailers can get their claws on these desperately needed items and extort New Yorkers who need them.\nA side benefit of COPA-C (for clothing) is that some items might be out of fashion by the time the capitalists get them, forcing retailers to put them on the discount rack. New Yorkers could then experience what it\u2019s like to shop in Cuba, which would be a nice benefit to people who can\u2019t afford international vacations.\nCynics might say this would never work. They note that COPA-type laws in other cities\nmerely delay sales\n, and that tenants and nonprofits were already free to bid on buildings at any time.\nBesides, the critics say, nonprofit landlords in New York City are\nstruggling\nto keep their rent-stabilized buildings above water, because the\nHSTPA\nin 2019 put a tourniquet on rents,\nhousing court\nmakes it\nincredibly time-consuming\nto evict tenants who don\u2019t pay and insurance premiums have soared.\nThe skeptics also point out that even if buildings are owned by nonprofits, they must still generate more revenue than they pay in operating expenses. This surplus is technically not \u201cprofit,\u201d but it\u2019s used to pay the salaries of staffers and executives.\nFor example, mission-driven Riseboro Community Partnership, one of the city\u2019s best nonprofit housing providers,\npaid its staffers $30 million\nand its executives $2.5 million last year \u2014 which accounted for 46 percent of its expenses.\nI have a message for all the COPA critics: Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.\n",

The site at 155 East 173rd Street will become The Heartwood, complete with 113 units atop the renovated library.\nThe residences are all intended to be affordable, rent-stabilized units. A chunk of those units will be reserved for those previously experiencing homelessness. Amenities will include outdoor terraces, community rooms and a fitness center.\nThe library will span more than 17,000 square feet and include meeting rooms, study areas and a host of technological options. The New York Public Library is looking for funding to launch a temporary branch for the duration of the renovation.\nIt\u2019s expected to be certified as an\nenvironmentally friendly Passive House\n, which would make it the first branch in the public library system to receive that designation.\nThere\u2019s no estimated cost for the project available. The timeline is also murky, as the project will need to go through the land-use review procedure.\nBut it is part of a broader effort known as the Living Libraries initiative, designed to add more housing and services to the library system. The New Utrecht Library in Bensonhurst is being targeted for potential affordable housing additions.\nSettlement Housing Fund has experience in the Bronx and a development portfolio of more than 8,900 units since its founding more than 50 years ago. The nonprofit was\nthe agent\nfor the entity owning the Starrett City apartment complex when Rockpoint Group and Brooksville Partners took full control in 2021.\nKalel Companies, which has preserved or redeveloped more than 4,000 homes, recently\nmade waves\nwhen it partnered with the Masjid Abdul Muhsi Khalifah mosque on a mixed-use redevelopment of the latter\u2019s space at 1166 Bedford Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\nThe venture aims to raze the three-story property and replace it with a 12-story, 94,000-square-foot building with 144 senior housing units.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Public details about the unit are limited, but it spans 16,053 square feet. That means the sale works out to $5,358 per square foot.\nIt tops\nthe previous condo price record\nin Miami-Dade, set last year at Fort\u2019s adjacent condo, Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club, when an entity tied to Apple sold an oceanfront penthouse for $44 million.\nBut winning the title could be a short-lived victory. Last year, a penthouse at the to-be-completed Auberge-branded Shore Club in Miami Beach reportedly went into contract for\n$120 million\n. The deal has not closed, but could as soon as next year if Witkoff Group and Monroe Capital finish the 49-unit oceanfront development by its projected 2026 completion date. If it sells at that price, it would set a Miami-Dade record for both condo sales and residential sales overall.\nThese sales are another symptom of the region\u2019s wealth migration. As a wave of billionaire and multimillionaire buyers moved into the market, demand surged for homes at the\nextreme end of the luxury scale\n.\nAshi completed the 34-unit, 11-story, two-building\nSeaway\nlast year. The design team included architect Joseph Dirand and landscape designer Peter Wirtz. Seaway residents have access to the amenities at the Surf Club next door, which includes four pools, a private club and Thomas Keller restaurant.\nThe Seaway complex has attracted a set of high-profile buyers since closings began last year. Jeff and Shari Aronson, the philanthropist founders of Coconut Grove-based Centerbridge Foundation, bought a unit for $12.3 million. David Foley, a senior managing director in Blackstone\u2019s private equity group, bought a condo for $24.5 million. In January, financier Bippy Siegal and his wife, Jacqueline Siegal, bought a trio of units for\n$18.5 million\n. In December, an entity linked to health care mogul Frederick Howe bought two units for a combined\n$31.1 million\n.",

        "content": "A home on Bayview Drive was the latest to sell for more than $8 million in Lake Geneva last week, extending the bull run on lakefront property in the Wisconsin resort town this fall.\nThe home at 831 Bayview Drive sold in an off-market transaction on Nov. 17 for $8.3 million. The 7,100-square-foot house has five bedrooms and two bathrooms. It has between 50 and 100 feet of lake frontage, according to listing information.\nCompass agent Daniel Oleston represented the sellers, and Wendy Murphy with Mahler Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyers. Both declined to comment on the sale.\nThe home\u2019s buyers appear to have traded their previous Lake Geneva residence for the larger Bayview Drive home. The buyers were Philip and Melody Lekousis, who sold a 3,300-square-foot house on\nPark Drive for $6 million\nearlier in November, according to public records. Wayne and Brenda Williams were the sellers.\nLake Geneva, along with other\nChicagoland waterfront getaways\nlike the North Shore and southeast Michigan, has had a luxury market boom this fall. The Bayview Drive sale is the seventh lakefront home to sell in\nLake Geneva\nsince October, and the fourth to fetch a price of more than $8 million. One of those homes is next door at 837 Bayview Drive, which sold in October for $8.6 million.\nOther notable sales this fall include a Lake Shore Drive house that\nclosed for $10.3 million\n, about $500,000 above its asking price, and another on Bonnie Brae Lane that sold for\n$8.7 million\n.\nThe highest sale price for Lake Geneva this year came in June, when an\nestate on Lackey Lane\nsold off market for $20 million.\nThe Bayview Drive house was last sold in November 2022 for $5.8 million. The 2025 price tag marks a 43 percent appreciation in about three years, in line with other homes on the lakefront that have seen their values surge in the post-pandemic years.\nThe fall heat may be cooling down going into the winter: only two lakefront homes are currently listed for sale in Lake Geneva, and both appear to have had trouble finding buyers.\nA 7,800-square-foot spec build was listed for nearly $10 million in September, and dropped its asking price by about $1 million on Friday. A 3,900-square-foot log cabin-style home has struggled to find footing, cutting its ask from $6.75 million in August to a current $5.6 million after two price chops.\n",

        "content": "A rare pulse of capital is hitting Chicago\u2019s moribund office market, where a $700 million refinancing for the Bank of America Tower is moving ahead as many downtown landlords are still fighting for survival.\nThe deal, backed by mortgage bonds, stands out in a city where few investors have been willing to touch office paper. The tower\u2019s\nowners\n\u2014 Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital \u2014 are taking on the debt. The sale marks the largest office-backed bond offering in Chicago since the pandemic, a sign that commercial mortgage-backed securities buyers will still write checks for top-tier assets, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nChicago\u2019s office fundamentals are still scraping bottom. The city\u2019s vacancy rate climbed to a record 26.5 percent in the third quarter, according to CBRE. While New York has started to regain some\nmomentum\n, Chicago continues to wrestle with hollowed-out towers, sluggish leasing and the lingering drag of remote work.\nThe Bank of America Tower, though, remains one of the\nexceptions\n. The 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive is 98 percent leased, with Bank of America anchoring 17 floors and contributing roughly a third of total rent, according to bond documents cited by the publication. Its riverfront site and proximity to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center have kept it competitive, and its slate of amenities \u2014 including restaurants from celebrity chefs such as Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \u2014 gives it the kind of hospitality edge landlords now need to draw tenants.\nThe refinancing replaces a loan held by a group of banks, the outlet reported, and lands at a moment when falling interest rates have started to thaw capital markets.\nOffice-backed CMBS issuance all but froze after the pandemic, eventually saddling bondholders with once-unthinkable losses on AAA-rated slices. The resurgence began about a year ago with splashy New York deals tied to Rockefeller Center and the MetLife Building. Chicago, still viewed warily by many national investors, hadn\u2019t yet joined that rebound.\nBut earlier this year,\nSalesforce Tower\n\u2014 just across the Chicago River from the Bank of America building \u2014 secured a $610 million refinancing, another data point suggesting lenders are tiptoeing back into the Class A towers with strong rent rolls.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In the first week of October,\nBrooklyn saw 35 contracts signed for $108 million\nin total asking volume.\nThe strong week continues the trend of buyers defying expectations following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful campaign for mayor, which had many in the\nreal estate world concerned about an exodus of wealthy New Yorkers\n. The market saw a slew of activity instead, with homes last week entering into contract with no discount, on average. The median asking price was $2.9 million and homes spent an average of 80 days on the market.\nThe top deal signed last week went to penthouse 2C at\nRAL Companies\u2019 Quay Tower\nin Brooklyn Heights.\nSpanning over 2,500 square feet with three bedrooms and three full bathrooms, the condo had a last asking price of nearly $6 million.\nThe unit features a large living room, chef-inspired kitchen and a primary suite with a walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom with cast-stone double sinks, radiant heated floors and a free-standing bathtub.\nThe home had originally been asking $6.75 million in April 2024 before dropping the price three months later.

Penthouse 2C was the final unsold penthouse at the project, according to Marketproof.\nThe project\u2019s\ntrophy penthouse sold for $20.3 million in 2020\n, setting the record for the priciest deal in Brooklyn that year.\nThe second priciest deal last week went to a townhouse at 175 Saint James Place in Clinton Hill asking $5.5 million.\nSpanning over 4,500 square feet, the three-story home features four bedrooms and three full bathrooms.\nA second-floor primary suite has dual walk-in closets, a private terrace and an ensuite bathroom with a soaking tub, along with a second room that can be used as an office space.\nA den at the rear of the parlor level opens onto a deck overlooking a back garden.\nThe home last sold for $1.8 million in 2023 to a limited liability company, according to public records.\nCompass\u2019 Tali Berzak had the listing.\n",

The four-bedroom apartment was the priciest of 29 properties in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals last week.\nAn entity tied to Falic bought Unit 32A from the developer in 2018 for\n$26.5 million\n. In August 2022, he listed the 3,700-square-foot condo for $37.5 million before pulling it off the market three months later. It hit the market again in May.\nFalic found a buyer for the unit after trading the family\u2019s waterfront mansion in Bal Harbour earlier this year. The home at 74 Bal Bay Drive, which Falic bought with his mother and two brothers, sold for\n$17.5 million\n.\nCorcoran\u2019s Manju Jasty Curry had the listing for the Midtown apartment, which overlooks Central Park.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a penthouse at\n823 Park Avenue\n, with an asking price just under $27 million. Billionaire hedge funder Joseph Edelman bought the Lenox Hill condo through an LLC in 2008 for $30.5 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nEdelman first sought to offload the 7,200-square-foot apartment in 2021, when he listed it for more than $33 million. But the unit struggled to find a buyer a year later, even after Edelman dropped the asking price to just under $30 million, and he pulled it from the market. He listed it again in March with a $30 million price tag, though he lowered it to $27 million six months later.\nThe triplex has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features three terraces, a formal dining room overlooking Park Avenue, a Jacuzzi and a home theater. Amenities in the 11-unit building, developed by Property Markets Group, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche, Clare Cukier, Michelle Flikerski, Catherine Rutter and Reilly Lavrich had the listing.\nThe total of 29 pending deals was up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n. Of the properties, 22 were condos, five were co-ops and two were townhouses. Half of the contracts signed were for new development homes.\nThe properties asked a combined $243 million, which works out to an average price of $8.4 million and a median of $5.2 million. The typical home was on the market for nearly two years and had a discount of 6 percent.\n",

        "content": "A troubled Midtown condo project is sliding deeper into disarray as its developer faces another aggressive move from a lender.\nWaterfall Asset Management is seeking to seize Rudy Gabsi\u2019s stake in 611 West 56th Street after the developer allegedly ignored an eight-figure court judgment tied to the luxury tower, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court to take control of Gabsi\u2019s 90 percent interest in the 35-story, 80-unit building, according to the court filing.\nIn May, a judge ordered Gabsi to pay $92.1 million for defaulting on a 2016 loan backing the project. He never paid, the suit says, nor did he show up to defend himself. With interest and fees, the tab has climbed to $93.4 million.\nWaterfall wants the court to authorize the sheriff to seize any documents needed to transfer Gabsi\u2019s ownership stake. The lender wants a judge to reroute future condo-sale proceeds from the building directly into its hands.\nGabsi personally guaranteed the debt on the project, developed with Sumaida + Khurana.\nReaching him has proven difficult. His Leny Group lists no contact information and court records place him in Tel Aviv. Waterfall and its attorney, meanwhile, did not return calls from the publication.\nThe tower opened in 2022 on a gritty edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen known historically as Automobile Row, sporting an offering plan projecting a $232 million sellout. But units have been slow to move: nine sponsor apartments were still on the market Friday, priced from $1.1 million to $6.7 million.\nThe fight adds to a growing pile of setbacks for Gabsi, whose New York portfolio has been unraveling since the pandemic. His boutique condo at 534 West 29th Street was headed for auction this fall over a defaulted mortgage until he signed over the keys in a deed-in-lieu agreement.\nEarlier this year, he also lost six mixed-use sites in Williamsburg through a bankruptcy process after defaulting on a $92 million note; CIM Group picked up the properties\nfor $56 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Here are the real estate people who made the cut.\nMamdani started the week by naming more than 400 people to 17 different committees. The housing-related group includes nonprofit housing organizations, union reps, Yimby groups, religious leaders, tenant groups, private real estate developers and multifamily lenders.\nThose representing the private side include:\nReal Estate Board of New York Chair and Two Trees Management CEO Jed Walentas\nL+M CEO Lisa Gomez\nM Squared COO Carolee Fink\nMerchants Capital vice chair Matt Wambua\nNew York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Carlina Rivera (a nonprofit that represents affordable housing developers)\nThe representatives from the private sector are largely affordable housing developers, though obviously REBNY represents various sectors in the industry. The committee doesn\u2019t include leaders from the landlord groups that mostly represent rent-stabilized owners, but it does include Rafael Cestero, CEO of the Community Preservation Corporation, who has been\nsounding the alarm\nabout\nmounting distress\nin the city\u2019s stabilized housing stock.\nSome members of the committee are also veterans of the de Blasio and Bloomberg administrations. Gomez was a senior vice president at the city\u2019s Housing Development Corporation under Bloomberg.\nFink was chief of staff to Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen during the de Blasio administration. Before that, she was executive vice president and chief development officer of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. She also was a senior advisor to Deputy Mayor Robert Steel under Bloomberg.\nWambua headed the Department of Housing Preservation and Development under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Before that, he was executive vice president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation and had served as a senior policy advisor for Dan Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development.\n(If the name Merchants rings a bell: My colleague wrote about Merchants\u2019 parent company,\nMerchant Bank\n, which lent to a number of people who were charged as part of a federal mortgage fraud probe. During the second quarter, the bank recorded write-downs for 14 customers totaling $46.1 million in the second quarter this year, citing fraud.)\nThe Partnership for New York\u2019s Kathy Wylde was named to a separate committee focused on economic and workforce development.\nOn the tenant side, the committee includes New York State Tenant Bloc\u2019s Cea Weaver, CAAAV\u2019s Alina Shen, Legal Aid Society\u2019s Adriene Holder, New York Communities for Change\u2019s Olivia Leirer and Community Service Society\u2019s Iziah Thompson.\nPro-housing policy reps include Open New York\u2019s Annemarie Gray, Regional Plan Association\u2019s Moses Gates and Paul Williams, executive director of the think tank Center for Public Enterprise.\nSomething else that is likely to catch the attention of the industry: At least five representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America were named to various committees.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What issues do you think should be at the top of the agenda for the housing-focused transition committee? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Tuesday marks a largely\nforgotten\nNovember celebration known as \u201cEvacuation Day,\u201d which marked the day that British troops left Manhattan after the Revolutionary War in 1783.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Monday\ndismissed\nmortgage fraud charges against state Attorney General Tish James. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in an order that Lindsey Halligan, the acting federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia who charged James, was improperly appointed and had \u201cno lawful authority to present the indictment.\u201d\n\u2014 ICYMI, the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America voted against endorsing Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 in his potential primary challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Through an online survey, 626 members voted against the endorsement, 555 voted in favor and 24 abstained. After the results of the vote were released, Oss\u00e9 posted on X: \u201cNYC DSA FOREVER \u2764\ufe0f IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$6.3 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 830 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer, and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$80.8 million\nfor the 87,620-square-foot, 12-story office building at 322-326 Seventh Avenue in Chelsea.

Neither the cost nor value of the new home on the site have been disclosed.\nThe home was built by developer\nThomas James Homes\n. The permitting process for the property took two months, while the rebuild took six. \u201cGiven that the community needs housing, we thought this would be a great opportunity to show them what we can do,\u201d Thomas James chief executive Jamie Mead said.\nThomas James Homes bought the property before the fires ripped through the Pacific Palisades in January; the company purchased the home for $3.4 million last November. The new Palisades home is larger than its previous iteration, spanning four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms across nearly 4,000 square feet. By contrast, the original home that burned down was a 1,600-square-foot ranch. The rebirthed Kagawa Street property boasts fire-resistant features like closed eaves to block embers and plumbing for a fire defense system that homeowners can opt to add; in the case of an approaching fire, the home will be covered in water and fire retardant.\nThe new home was constructed as a showcase home, meant to show other residents looking to rebuild what could be possible for their burned lots. Thomas James Homes is building residences for 30 families in the Palisades and plans to build 100 more next year. A grand opening for the home, in which the community will be able to visit, is set for Dec. 6.\nSo far, nearly 2,000 permits have been issued in both the Palisades and\nEaton fire\nzones,\naccording\nto the state\u2019s rebuilding dashboard.

The proposal calls for constructing 282 homes, including 248 attached townhomes and flats and 34 detached single-family homes, on a 13.5-acre site.\nThe homes would be delivered in two- to four-story buildings. Floor plans would include a mix of two-, three- and four-bedroom units. The development would come with 641 parking spaces as well as an 18,000-square-foot central community park with a pool, shade structures, barbecue space and lawn. Designs for the project are being handled by KTGY and C2 Collaborative.\nIf city officials sign off on the project, including a general plan amendment and a zone change, construction of the Spanish and Seaside-style development could break ground as early as January. Construction is expected to take two years to complete.\nMeritage Homes has other townhome projects in the pipeline. The Scottsdale, Arizona-based firm is currently developing a 93-unit townhome project in Norwalk and an 86-unit endeavor in Santa Ana. The firm\nbought the vacant office building\nwhere the latter project will rise at 2020 East First Street earlier this year for $19.2 million.\nLast week, Meritage bought the former Trinity Broadcasting Network campus in Costa Mesa for $44.5 million with plans to turn the 70,800-square-foot property into 142 homes. The purchase comes after it secured approvals from the\nCity of Costa Mesa\nin August to build housing at the site.

        "content": "The City of Pleasanton is weighing a large-scale redevelopment of parking lots surrounding the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station into as many as 1,300 homes.\nThe Pleasanton City Council reviewed early conceptual plans from city staff to begin the process of redeveloping the 14.9-acre site at 5835 and 5859 Owens Drive into a transit-oriented, mixed-use community, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. Bay Area Rapid Transit owns 250 acres of developable land in 22 cities across the region; the transit authority believes the land has the potential to hold more than 28,000 units of housing.\nThe City Council reviewed two options from staffers that could eventually shape what a request for proposals from developers would look like. One option calls for building 870 to 1,088 units in two five-story buildings and two-seven story buildings; the other proposes between 1,047 and 1,309 units in two seven-story buildings and one five-to-eight-story building. The property can be split into three or four parcels, with city officials leaving the door open to future developments like hotels, offices or education space.\nThe Dublin/Pleasanton BART station was identified as a housing opportunity site as part of its housing element. When the City created that housing plan, it estimated that the site could house up to 555 units. New state legislation incentivizing transit-oriented development, however, has allowed developers to swing bigger on such projects near train stations, bumping up the purported capacity at the Pleasanton station by more than double. Under AB 2923, transit-oriented projects near some hubs in the Bay Area must have a minimum density of 75 units per acre and a minimum height of five stories; of those units, 20 percent must be set aside as affordable housing.\nUnder its housing element, the City of Pleasanton must\nplan\nfor 5,965 new units of housing by 2031.\nOther BART stations in the region are already becoming the center of new transit-oriented developments. Last year, Oakland-based affordable housing developer East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation broke ground on a 97-unit, seven-story affordable senior housing\nbuilding at the Lake Merritt BART station\n; that project is the first phase of a mixed-use development that will ultimately boast more than 550 units.\nThe\nNorth Berkeley\nand Ashby BART stations are similarly getting new developments. In July, city officials chose Adeline Alliance Partners, a development team including Pacific Companies, SUDA and Resources for Community Development, to\nbuild 620 units at the Ashby station\n. And in El Cerrito, a joint venture between Holliday Development,\nRelated California\nand Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA) are planning a 750-unit mixed-income project slated for construction in five phases.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Marquette Companies is joining in on the action as the Chicago suburbs\u2019 multifamily market extends its hot streak.\nNaperville-based\nMarquette\nbought the 198-unit Arlington Lakes Apartments from Deerfield-based Orion Residential for $46 million. The deal came out to just over $232,000 per unit. Though it\u2019s unclear what Orion\u2019s total investment in the complex was, the firm took over the apartments via a quit claim deed in 2018 and took out a $27.9 mortgage against the property.\nThe sale of the property at 909 East Golf Road in\nArlington Heights\nwas also the result of the companies\u2019 recent partnership. Marquette and Orion announced earlier this month that the two firms would join some of their operations and that Orion executive Dan Gumbiner would serve as an adviser while Orion\u2019s senior vice president of asset management, Cheryl Charnas, would join Marquette\u2019s asset management team as executive vice president.\nNow that Marquette has purchased the Orion Arlington Lakes Apartments at 917 West Golf Road, the firm will step in as property manager, perform renovations and rebrand the property to Avery at Arlington Lakes.\nThe spreadout, 1985-built complex of garden style units has been consistently 97 percent occupied, said Jim Cunningham, president of Marquette Management.\nChicagoland\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well all year because the city didn\u2019t experience the same Covid-era building boom that caught on in some cities in the southeast and Sun Belt.\nA steady job market and low supply of new construction has drawn investors, especially in the suburbs where they don\u2019t have to contend with Chicago\u2019s political environment. But the Arlington Heights property still faces the downside of dealing with Cook County\u2019s unpredictable property tax system.\nAs a result, suburban properties bordering Cook County have seen the most interest and that has recently extended to more buyers looking at outer ring suburbs as well.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage Interra Realty found, and a few outer ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nOut of the metro area\u2019s total multifamily sales, the share of sales that took place in Kendall County was up 300 percent, and a whopping 550 percent in Will County, compared to the same time period last year, according to new analysis from Interra.\n",

        "content": "Onni Group is closing in on its second major Loop office bet, negotiating to buy the 50-story tower at 161 North Clark Street \u2014 a move that would plant the Vancouver developer directly across from Google\u2019s future Chicago headquarters.\nThe firm is in advanced talks to acquire the nearly 1.1 million-square-foot skyscraper from an affiliate of\nSociete Generale\n, which seized the property last year through a $237 million foreclosure, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing people familiar with the offering.\nIt would be\nOnni\u2019s\nsecond turnaround project in the heart of the Loop. The company recently overhauled\n225 West Randolph Street\n, rebranded as The Bell, and nearly filled it at a time when most downtown landlords are bleeding occupancy. A purchase of 161 North Clark would double down on its thesis that Google\u2019s redevelopment of the Thompson Center \u2014 set to finish next year \u2014 will pull foot traffic, talent and tenants deeper into the central Loop.\nThat halo effect is already visible. Firms have cited proximity to Google as a reason to sign leases nearby, and the Clark Street tower itself just landed law firm Wilson Elser in a 20,000-square-foot deal tied directly to the tech giant\u2019s arrival. CoStar pegs the building at almost 89 percent leased, well above the downtown average of 72 percent, buoyed in part by Cook County\u2019s 106,000-square-foot swing-space lease signed in 2022.\nThe price Onni is offering is unclear, but it will almost certainly reflect the brutal reset in downtown\u2019s office values. Societe Generale inherited the tower when its prior owners \u2014 a Korea Post-led venture advised by CBRE Investment Management \u2014 defaulted amid rising interest rates and collapsing workspace demand. A discount may force the bank to absorb a sizable loss on 161 North Clark Street, which last sold for roughly $331 million in 2013.\nSociete Generale initially signaled it would hold the tower long-term, boasting of new leasing momentum even as it hired\nEastdil Secured\nbrokers Bryan Rosenberg and David Caprile to shop the property. Onni\u2019s pursuit suggests a familiar pattern for the firm: buy distress, invest in modernization and ride a potential rebound, this one perhaps driven by the Thompson Center\u2019s next phase.\nOnni has become one of Chicago\u2019s most prolific developers, best known for its residential push in Fulton Market, River North and Goose Island, where it has more than 5,000 apartments proposed. But the firm also has deep Loop credentials, owning 200 North LaSalle Street since 2012.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s top-tier apartment rents are rising faster than anywhere else in the country, fueled by a construction pipeline that has slowed to a trickle and a wave of renters willing to pay for the newest buildings in the buzziest neighborhoods.\nChicago led all major U.S. metros in rent growth in October, with typical asking rents up 6 percent year over year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\nbased on a Zillow finding. The\nChicago area\nalso slipped in the firm\u2019s affordability index, ranking 39th out of the 50 largest metros. And the market\u2019s imbalance isn\u2019t easing anytime soon. Only 9,800 apartments are under construction \u2014 just 1.7 percent of total inventory \u2014 and fewer than 1,500 are expected to be delivered this year, according to CoStar.\nPrice tags at the One Chicago apartment complex for instance, located at 14 West Superior Street in River North, start around $2,700 a month, with three-bedrooms topping $13,000, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThose eye-watering prices aren\u2019t outliers anymore, as the city\u2019s supply of attainable housing is shrinking, testing the limits of Chicago\u2019s long-touted affordability edge.\nDemand is being stoked on multiple fronts. Americans are renting longer as the average first-time homebuyer hits 40, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. Elevated interest rates and economic churn make renting feel safer, and remote workers with six-figure salaries continue to arrive from New York, California, Florida and Texas. Many can comfortably afford Class A rent \u2014 and compared to the coasts, Chicago still looks like a deal.\nThat\u2019s especially true downtown.\nLuxury Living\n, a boutique residential brokerage, told the outlet that gross rents for the Class A market \u2014 about 28,500 units across 85 properties built since 2016 \u2014 climbed 6.3 percent in the third quarter to $3,228 a month. River North led the surge with a 13 percent jump, pushing average rents to $3,738. The typical luxury renter is making six figures, has been leasing for several years, and isn\u2019t in a hurry to buy, founder Aaron Galvin said.\nThe high-end boom isn\u2019t limited to the city.\nSuburban developers\nare rolling out luxury products aimed at downsizers and remote workers with deep pockets. One Winnetka on the North Shore has a waiting list for units renting from $7,000 to over $12,500, developer John Murphy told the outlet. Tight supply, pricey construction and a reshuffled office market are pushing demand\noutward\n.\nBut as the luxury tier balloons, the middle is evaporating. Chicago\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 older, unsubsidized units that rent below market \u2014 is disappearing. Two- and four-flats in neighborhoods like Lincoln Park and Lakeview are being scrapped for single-family homes; others in areas like Logan Square are trading hands, renovated and repriced.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an erosion of the low-cost rental supply, and that just means to the extent that renters need affordable housing, they\u2019re having a harder and harder time,\u201d Geoff Smith, executive director of DePaul University\u2019s Institute for Housing Studies, told the outlet.\nOwners of modest buildings say demand is so intense they raise rents without losing tenants. Silver Property Group\u2019s Ron Abrams likened it to \u201cshooting fish in a barrel\u201d at a recent real estate panel.\nChicago remains cheaper than New York or L.A., but rents are rising faster than wages. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows wage growth slowing and employment gains flattening. Zillow economist Orphe Divounguy warned that if that gap widens, Chicago\u2019s talent pipeline could feel the strain.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller of the White Rock Lake waterfront home, Darren Phillips, had originally listed the property in January of 2023 for $15.8 million and dropped the price several times since then.\nThe home\u2019s nearest competitor is a landmark estate dubbed Mount Vernon, the former home of H.L. Hunt and the most expensive listing of July. The replica of George Washington\u2019s home at 4009 West Lawther Drive has a price history similar to Haidar\u2019s purchase, having wobbled between $30 million and $15 million under the same ownership since 2012.\nHaidar co-founded the tech companies Dialexa, Vinli, Robin and Rosy, and he holds several patents. Born Mahmoud Haidar to a family of Lebanese refugees in Kuwait, he was selected in 2019 to be a Presidential Leadership Scholar, a collaborative recognition of the presidential centers of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Lyndon B. Johnson. The younger Bush painted Haidar\u2019s portrait for his book \u201cOut of Many, One: Portraits of America\u2019s Immigrants.\u201d\nAlthough the price threshold of ultra-luxury in Texas has risen considerably in the past few years,\nrelistings\nhave taken up a greater share of Texas ultra-luxury inventory in the latter half of 2025, and price cuts have become more common.\nThe three-story main house at 4231 West Law, meanwhile, includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a 2,700-square-foot basement with two wine cellars. It shares almost four acres with an eight-car garage, horse stables, a guest house and a cabana overlooking White Rock Lake, the lake nearest Downtown Dallas.\nCompass Real Estate agent Mark Godson had the listing when the property sold, though Frada Sandler of Dave Perry Miller was representing the seller in 2023, when it was the most expensive listing in Texas.\n",

        "content": "A 23-story downtown Dallas hotel with a turbulent recent history is up for grabs, adding another sizable listing to the hospitality market.\nThe 291-key Crowne Plaza Dallas Downtown, located at 1015 Elm Street and just a block from the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, hit the market with a $55 million asking price, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Broker Salman Tabani of Tabani Realty first told the Dallas Morning News of the development.\nThe seller is TOG Hotels Downtown Dallas, tied to California-based TOG Hotels, owned by Terry Tognazzini, who has owned the property since 2007. The hotel, last valued at $17.15 million by the Dallas Central Appraisal District \u2014 a figure that often diverges widely from market pricing \u2014 is among downtown\u2019s older\nbranded assets\n. Built in 1969, the Crowne Plaza underwent more than $10 million in upgrades in 2020 aimed at keeping pace with newer competitors.\nThe last couple of years have brought unflattering attention.\u00a0 Last summer, ownership abruptly canceled the\nDaddyLand Festival\n, a gay music event booked at the hotel, and directed attendees to leave. The move came after hotel staff received guest complaints about the gay-themded event, reportedly from members of two collegiate sorority groups that were also holding events on the property at the time.\nThe hotel\u2019s ownership entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February of this year, a case Tabani said it expects to conclude this month. A restructuring brought in a new management company, Arizona-based Universal Hospitality Solutions, and a new general manager, Joseph Jennings.\nDespite the rough patches, buyer appetite for downtown Dallas hospitality assets hasn\u2019t dimmed. Earlier this year, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners paid roughly $111 million for the\nFairmont Dallas\n, a deal that signaled investor confidence in the city\u2019s convention-driven demand and its post-pandemic travel recovery.\nThe Crowne Plaza\u2019s proximity to the convention center \u2014 and to redevelopment efforts swirling around the southern edge of downtown \u2014 could bolster interest, even as rising operating expenses and softening business travel weigh on underwriting. FIFA will use the existing convention halls as its International Broadcast Center during the\nWorld Cup\nnext year all while developers work through the first phase of the project known as Inspire Dallas, a multibillion-dollar redevelopment of the convention center at 650 South Griffin Street.\nThe sale would represent a sizable step-up from its county appraisal and a reset for a hotel that\u2019s cycled through controversy, capital projects and operational shifts in just a few years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "HN Capital Partners is doubling down on the Design District, unveiling a slate of new restaurants and a fitness concept as it works to turn the eclectic showroom enclave into a round-the-clock neighborhood.\nThe Dallas-based firm is adding five eateries plus an indoor padel complex across its growing portfolio in the area, where it now owns roughly 40 acres at 1650 Oak Lawn Avenue, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Jo\u2019seon Wagyu Omakase, a Korean-Japanese fusion format, is slated to debut in early December. Delilah \u2014 the celebrity magnet born in Los Angeles \u2014 is expected to open within 60 days, potentially with a January splash. Ospi, La Lupita Taco &amp; Mezcal and Alara Modern Mediterranean will follow in stages through early 2026.\nVipin Nambiar, founder and managing partner of HN Capital Partners, told the outlet that he expects to announce a sixth restaurant in the coming weeks. HN Capital \u2014 along with McCort Partners \u2014 began amassing properties mostly within the\nDesign District\nfour years ago and now owns about 40 acres in the area Northwest of downtown.\nIt\u2019s a major jolt for a district with about 17 existing eateries and a widening profile among developers chasing Dallas\u2019 next creative cluster. HN won\u2019t say how much it\u2019s spending, though it notes that top-shelf concepts like Delilah run into the millions. The Dallas outpost will span about 15,000 square feet and host private and corporate events \u2014 a strategy modeled after the brand\u2019s Vegas location, where snagging a table can be a sport.\nThe strategy is \u201cthoughtful placemaking,\u201d Nambiar said, tapping into the district\u2019s artsy identity without sanding down its edge.\nAsana Partners\u2019\nnew open-air center, The Seam, is rising nearby, and HN\u2019s moves are designed to help stitch the area into a coherent all-day destination rather than a nighttime-only hotspot.\nLunchtime traffic is a big part of that equation, which helped put Ospi \u2014 an Italian-American concept from \u201cTop Chef\u201d alum Jackson Kalb \u2014 at the top of HN\u2019s list to backfill the shuttered Meddlesome Moth.\nHN is layering in recreation too.\nThe firm is bringing New York-based Padel Haus to a 24,000-square-foot warehouse on Dragon Street, aiming for a first-half 2026 opening.\nPadel\n, a racket sport played inside glass enclosures, hasn\u2019t matched pickleball in popularity yet, but Nambiar told the outlet that he believes it could surpass it, calling the club a mix of fitness and social glue for Uptown, Oak Lawn and Design District residents and office workers.\nThe new leases preview the scale of HN\u2019s ambitions. Last year the firm and McCourt Partners unveiled plans for\nHi Line Square\n, a two-tower project expected to break ground in early 2026 and reshape the district\u2019s skyline.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Berkeley is a planned 25-story, 193-unit tower slated for 601 and 621 Clearwater Park Road, a 1.9-acre site also referred to as 550 Australian Avenue.\nAdelson\nlaunched sales\nin December of last year and landed a\n$62.5 million\npre-construction loan for the project in September. The sales team was previously led in-house by Joe Conwell. The tower is 20 percent pre-sold, according to the release.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the Berkeley\u2019s units will range from two-bedrooms to five-bedrooms, with four penthouses. Prices range from $2 million to $10 million. The tower\u2019s amenities will include a pool, spa facilities, a fitness center, a club room, co-working spaces and\na private dining room\n.\nConstruction is set to be completed in 2028, according to the release.\nAdelson teamed up with Sympatico, led by father-son duo Carlos and Thomas Morrison, for the project. The Morrisons are also partners on the\nMr. C Hotel &amp; Residences West Palm Beach\nwith David Martin\u2019s Terra. Last year, they\ndropped $17 million\non a 56-unit West Palm Beach apartment complex.\nTheir partnership with Elliman is timed with the start of the region\u2019s busy season for real estate sales. While sales typically pick up in the winter, market insiders say new development condo sales have moved at a slower pace than expected in West Palm Beach. Adelson acknowledged this in a September interview.\n\u201cThe market in South Florida has slowed down a bit. I think anyone you talk to will tell you that,\u201d he said.",

We are referring, of course, to the artwork accompanying\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s South Florida residential market reports for September and October, which show a dramatic revival after a stagnant couple of years. Is this reversal some kind of instant \u201cMamdani effect,\u201d or does the market truly have the right stuff for sustained altitude?

The brokerage said two additional agents also moved their licenses to Coldwell Banker but held off on naming their publicly. When counting all seven agents, the total production over the past 12 months for the incoming wave of recruits topped $150 million.\nClayman, the former broker of record and general manager of the\nBeverly Hills Estates\n, succeeded long-time Coldwell Banker Managing Broker Tom Dunlap in early August.\n\u201cI really want to focus on driving retention and recruitment, looking at top producers across the industry given my background and the number of brokerages I\u2019ve been at as an agent,\u201d Clayman told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of his appointment in discussing his goals in the first 90 days on the job.\nHere\u2019s a look at who Clayman recruited to Coldwell Banker, in addition to other recent local brokerage additions.\n\u27a4 Severin Braham is now with Coldwell Banker. Braham was formerly with the Beverly Hills Estates, where he served as director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group, a team helmed by the brokerage\u2019s founders Branden and Rayni Williams.\n\u27a4 Hannah Babitt made the move to Coldwell Banker from Rodeo Realty. Babitt cited Clayman as the reason for her joining the brokerage, with the two having once worked together in the music industry.\nBabitt also launched and is CEO of music management firm BABZ.\n\u27a4 Katy Johnson joined Coldwell Banker Realty from the Oppenheim Group, where she had been for a little over two years. The professional model runs a travel blog and also started a nonprofit called One Model Mission aimed at telling the stories of women from around the world.\n\u27a4 Former Hilton Hilton agent Mary Swanson is also now with Coldwell Banker. The move places her back under the same roof as Coldwell\u2019s top agent in the state,\nJade Mills\n, for whom Swanson was an assistant at the start of her real estate career.\n\u27a4 Myles Lewis, who holds licenses in California and Texas, was most recently with Compass before joining Coldwell Banker.\nHe joins with a music industry background, having served in senior executive roles at American Idol, BMI and Epic Records.\n\u27a4 Joseph Baena has moved his license over to\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\n. Baena, the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, was most recently with LPT Realty Inc. for about a year. He\u2019s also been with La Mesa Partners, Keller Williams R &amp; LS Investments and Marina Brokerage Partners since obtaining his license in 2021.\nBaena focuses on Santa Monica, Venice, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and other high-end markets in Los Angeles County.\nOutside of real estate, he also has a background in business, fitness and entertainment.\n\u27a4 Carl Gambino\u2019s Gambino Group at Compass added Sebastian Lorefice to its Los Angeles team with a focus on the Westside and broader L.A. real estate markets.\nLorefice joins after having served as a director of operations for two other teams. Before entering real estate, he was involved in corporate events for Hyatt Regency in Jersey City, New Jersey and then Newport Beach, Calif.\n",

I\u2019m very comfortable with this.\u201d\nThe house has a projected construction date of 2027, and Birov said he\u2019s in the process of obtaining permits for the house. The buyer will be able to make custom specifications on the details and finishes, Birov said.\nThe couple bought the original 1.6-acre property, which covered two parcels,\nfor $6.8 million in September\n. They split the parcels and are advertising a separate house for nearly $6 million on the smaller of the two parcels, which faces Sheridan Road and does not have lakefront access.\nThe home previously on the two lots was initially listed for $14 million in 2021, but went through several price cuts before closing at $6.8 million with the Birovs purchase.\nThe Birovs are frequent North Shore builders, having listed new construction homes in Kenilworth, Glencoe, Winnetka and Wilmette. In addition to the two Kenilworth homes, Heritage Luxury Homes is marketing another spec mansion in Glencoe asking $5.7 million.\nIn June, another home they developed in Glencoe sold for $4.7 million. Their sales in Wilmette include a $2 million home on Sunset Drive in 2024, as well as a 9,000-square-foot French Colonial on Michigan Avenue that fetched $4.8 million in 2022.\n",

        "content": "Another Union Square real estate deal is the latest sign of a potential\nrebirth of the neighborhood\n.\nSuitsupply bought the first two floors of retail space in the Grace Building at 166 Geary Street at a foreclosure auction for $19.6 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The menswear retailer has a 5,000-square-foot store in the building with a dedicated entrance one block over at 175\nMaiden Lane\n. The retail parcel had been in receivership since 2022.\nSuitsupply was already making real estate moves at the building prior to the acquisition. The Dutch fashion brand previously took on commercial mortgage-backed securities debt by buying the defaulted loan for the retail space from the mortgage trust that was given control of the building. The\nparcel\u2019s previous owner, the Jackson Group\n, bought the 12,907-square-foot retail space in 2014 for $46 million and was facing $38.5 million worth of CMBS debt before selling it.\nThe retail space was appraised at $26 million in 2016, but its value fell to $17.3 million last year. Suitsupply opened its flagship there in 2016 and continues to occupy 5,000 square feet of retail space. The apparel company also previously leased separate office space in the building; both the retail and office leases were slated to expire this May, but Suitsupply opted to pivot to a path to ownership. The building\u2019s top 14 floors of office space are tied to a separate loan and borrower than the retail parcel and acquired by a mortgage trust in June for $5.9 million.\nSuitsupply isn\u2019t the first retailer to become an owner in the Union Square area. In 2022,\nChanel bought the 340 Post Street building for $63 million\nwith plans to eventually move its San Francisco flagship there from its current home at 156 Geary Street next door to Suitsupply; Williams-Sonoma currently occupies the 340 Post building.\nSuitsupply has seemingly been venturing further into real estate acquisitions. Last month, prior to its purchase of the 166 Geary space, it formed the purchasing vehicle Suit Supply Real Estate San Francisco LLC. Earlier this year, it registered another entity, Suit Supply Real Estate Manchester Limited, in the U.K.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Old Parkland\nhas long been whispered about in Dallas finance circles as the place where the big checks get written.\nThe home of that mystique is growing: developer Harlan Crow has added three new office buildings to the 16-building compound, which now features 842,000 square feet of office space, reinforcing Old Parkland\u2019s status as the most elite address in North Texas wealth.\nBloomberg\nchronicled\nthe phenomenon, describing a setting at 3819 Maple Avenue near Reverchon Park that leans more Ivy League campus than office park, complete with manicured oaks, marble-clad and wood-paneled interiors as well as enough artifacts to fill a small museum.\nCrow\n, heir to the influential Trammell Crow real estate dynasty, has decorated the property with dinosaur eggs, presidential portraits and even a replica surgical amphitheater. Former President George W. Bush keeps an office on-site. Prospective tenants don\u2019t apply \u2014 they\u2019re invited, and often personally recruited.\nThe expansion comes as Dallas chases higher-end office demand.\nGoldman Sachs\nis building a $500 million campus,\nBank of America\nis adding a new tower and the\nregion\u2019s finance jobs\nnow outnumber those in Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBut trophy space is still hard to come by. Family offices and private equity shops want exclusivity without the sprawl, and Old Parkland \u2014 where\nCrow Holdings\nis headquartered in a restored 1913 hospital campus \u2014 charges some of the highest rents in the city. Even so, the new East Campus is reportedly 80 percent leased, and the\nNYSE just grabbed 28,000 square feet\nfor its Texas operation.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Old Parkland\u2019s draw goes beyond polish. The property hosts roughly 450 lectures and debates a year in its underground chamber, attracting everyone from Joe Biden to Rahm Emanuel to Karl Rove. For Austin-based founder Matt Weiss, a single lunch inside led to \u201ca couple million\u201d in commitments for his AI startup and a stack of new contacts. Other tenants say the address alone signals a level of access, noting amenities that verge on the theatrical, such as a parking garage that pipes in classical music.\nCrow, now more focused on politics than development, still shapes the campus culture. The selective roll-out of new buildings and the slow-burn leasing strategy aim to preserve the project\u2019s country-club aura, a rarity in the wider Dallas office market where vacancies hover around 25 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
