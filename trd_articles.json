        "content": "The Dallas real estate community is grieving the loss of a visionary who helped bring \u201c\nY\u2019all Street\n\u201d to life.\nColin Fitzgibbons\n, president of Hunt Realty Investments,\ndied\nat 46 on Nov. 21 of colon cancer. He is survived by his wife Jessica and their three sons, Patrick, Conor and Declan.\nAt the time of his death, he was years into spearheading the development of NorthEnd, a mixed-use community at 2323 North Field Street that will be home to Goldman Sachs\u2019 new Dallas campus. The 11-acre \u201curban arboretum\u201d is a critical element of an upcoming wave of investment that promises to make Uptown into a financial hub that rivals Wall Street.\nFitzgibbons grew up in Dallas but spent five years living in New York\u2019s Financial District while working at the Staubach Company, followed by nearly a decade at KDC working on high-profile projects like Legacy West. He was quick to give his understanding of what drew people to each city and worked to highlight Dallas\u2019 sometimes invisible perks.\n\u201cDeep down, there\u2019s an understanding that there\u2019s no reason for Dallas to really exist,\u201d he told The Real Deal in 2024 for a story on the upcoming developments that will form Y\u2019all Street.\n\u201cDallas is very business-friendly, and that\u2019s sort of been our reason for being. But the underpinnings of all that is, look, this has to be a great place to build a career and to raise a family. I think that\u2019s the secret sauce.\u201d\nFitzgibbons saw NorthEnd as a development that would embody the future of office space. He took that vision seriously and talked about his team\u2019s research into projects around the world to create the best possible development. He was also clear-eyed about what it means to be \u201cpro-business\u201d in a conservative state and advised leaders not to rely solely on the state\u2019s lack of income tax to maintain Texas\u2019 pro-business identity.\nA self-described \u201ccheerleader\u201d for Dallas, Fitzgibbons was optimistic about the city and city life in general, predicting that projects like NorthEnd could help make Uptown a truly urban slice of Dallas where residents and people who work there get around on foot or by public transit \u2014 a rarity for North Texas communities.\nPerhaps most importantly, he saw Dallas as a city that\u2019s still in the process of being molded and seemed to live by the idea that, if you want to see change, you can make it happen.\n\u201cOne of the things I love about Dallas is you can get involved so easily,\u201d he said during that 2024 interview.\nLow lows for Austin housing market\nThe tech boomtown\u2019s star has fallen almost as quickly as it rose. Austin notched the\nsteepest annual drops in price and financing activity\namong markets with at least 1 million residents in the last 12 months, according to\nTRDData\n. The median home sale price in the Texas capital region fell by 8.2 percent year-over- year to $416,000. The national median climbed by 4.8 percent to $375,000. Mortgage activity in Austin also bucked national trends.\nPurchase loan originations tumbled by almost 41 percent in the third quarter compared with a year before. Purchase mortgage originations dropped nationally in the third quarter as well, but just by 6.6 percent year over year, per Attom.\nForeclosures don\u2019t faze Ari Rastegar\nReal estate investor and CEO of Rastegar Capital\nAri Rastegar could lose four Austin apartment buildings\nat a foreclosure auction on Tuesday, but he isn\u2019t sweating it. The Austin multifamily market is so frozen that foreclosure has become another outlet to exit a deal, he said. He sang the same tune at an\nevent\nThe Real Deal and his firm put on in Downtown Austin in October.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t sell them *#!ing kick the keys back,\u201d he said this week.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender.\u201d Greystone provided the $22.7 million loan for Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street.\nWhite Rock Lake home buyer is Bush subject\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the artistic stylings of former President George W. Bush, you might recognize the\nbuyer of 4231 West Lawther Drive\non White Rock Lake. Entrepreneur Mark Haidar is a Lebanese refugee born in Kuwait and also the subject of a portrait painted by Bush, featured in his book, \u201cOut of Many, One: Portraits of America\u2019s Immigrants.\u201d The 9,140-square-foot home sits on a 3.7-acre lot and was most recently listed for $10.9 million.\n",

        "content": "LaSalle Partners\u2019 first ever hotel bet was the Montrose.\nIn late November, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which acquired LaSalle Hotel Properties for billions of dollars after battling Blackstone, announced it dumped the 133-key, West Hollywood hotel, with a \u201ctrailing 12-month financial performance.\u201d\nThe roughly $44 million trade of the boutique hotel at 900 Hammond Street, near Sunset Boulevard, amounts to about $333,000 a room.\nThat is nowhere near a\nrecord trade\n, but a sale is a sale in an area such as Los Angeles where\nhoteliers\nare defaulting on debt and facing forced sales \u2014 and the real estate investment trust\u2019s latest strategy is selling hotels and repurchasing shares at discount.\n\u201cL.A. is a difficult market to sell in today due to unfriendly government policies and the lagging impact from the fires, strikes, ICE, National Guard,\u201d Jon Bortz, Pebblebrook chairman and chief executive, said. Measure ULA, or the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d doesn\u2019t help either, but West Hollywood commercial deals are exempt. Another issue, the perception that homelessness is rampant, contributes to declining tourism, and therefore revenues.\n\u201cWe were very happy to find an interested buyer. We were not specifically marketing the hotel. The buyer approached us,\u201d Bortz said in an email.\nThe company did not disclose the buyer, but a person familiar said it is a high-net-worth individual who has roots in Los Angeles, believes in its future and loves buying all kinds of real estate at discounts. There are at least a couple people who fit that description.\nSeparately, the publicly traded company said it has another other hotel under contract at a sales price of $72 million, but was vague on details.\nAll kinds of pain\nThere\u2019s Los Angeles hotel pain, and then there\u2019s Los Angeles office pain.\nCarlton Plaza, a 155,000-square-foot, brick and black glass office building located in the Valley\u2019s Woodland Hills neighborhood, is on the auction block. The auction was scheduled for Nov. 24 but was postponed to Dec. 22. It was the special servicer that requested a postponement, according to Prestige Default Services.\nCarlton Plaza owner Peregrine Realty Partners owes lenders about $24 million, records reveal.\nThe debt was originated by JP Morgan, packaged with other commercial property debts and sold off to investors.\nThe property, at 20750 Ventura Boulevard, is only worth $12 million, according to Morningstar Credit, but in pre-pandemic 2018, it was valued at $35 million. The property is 71 percent occupied, the most recent available data shows. (Offices in Woodland Hills have a 22 percent vacancy rate, versus 20 percent in the Valley.).\nPeregrine Realty Partners\u2019 principals did not respond to a request for comment.\nMore on Rexford\nLast column\n, the industrial real estate investment trust announced a chief executive shakeup and teased an announcement of an independent board member (all post-Elliott Investment Management stake). That happened sooner than anticipated. Rexford appointed David Stockert to the company\u2019s board of directors, effective Jan. 1. He\u2019ll serve on the board\u2019s audit committee.\nStockert is a general partner of Sweetwater Opportunity Funds, a series of private real estate investment funds. He has held executive and senior roles at other REITs such as Post Properties, Weeks Corporation and Duke Realty, which was acquired by Prologis.\nRexford\u2019s latest proxy reveals the non-employee director compensation program includes a $100,000 annual cash retainer and $150,000 annual restricted stock award \u2014 and because he\u2019ll be an audit committee member he\u2019ll get another $20,000 in cash.\nBusy, busy Beverly Hills\nA lease, a buy and development happened in the ritzy enclave of Beverly Hills.\nUnited Talent Agency\nrenewed\nits 192,000-square-foot headquarters lease at the plaza that shares its name at 9336 to 9346 Civic Center Drive; Alo Yoga\ndropped\n$90 million for headquarters at 8942 Wilshire Boulevard, which came out to more than $1,000 a square foot; and Cain\u2019s $10 billion One Beverly Hills went vertical.\n",

        "content": "The CEO allegedly at the center of Brazil\u2019s latest banking scandal quietly amassed a portfolio of luxury homes in Miami \u2014 reinforcing the familiar truth that there\u2019s always a Florida connection to a major news story.\nDaniel Vorcaro led and was the largest shareholder of Banco Master, which Brazil\u2019s central bank shut down earlier this month. Brazilian authorities allege the Rio de Janeiro-based bank created fake credit operations that were then sold to Banco de Bras\u00edlia SA, as part of a multibillion-dollar fraud. Officials arrested Vorcaro on Nov. 18 as part of their investigation into the bank.\nVorcaro, who is dating fitness and fashion influencer Martha Graeff, is\nlinked to the ownership\nof at least two condos and two homes in Miami, acquired between 2023 and early 2025, according to sources and property records. He was living the high life, often sporting Rolex or Patek Philippe watches, dining at top restaurants, flying private and hosting elaborate parties, Bloomberg reports.\nVorcaro\u2019s biggest purchase in Miami is the 20,500-square-foot mansion at 4445 and 4425 Sabal Palm Road in Miami\u2019s gated Bay Point neighborhood. A Delaware LLC paid $85.2 million for the waterfront estate in January, a record for Bay Point. A month later, the same LLC paid $6.9 million for the non-waterfront house across the street at 4430 Sabal Palm Road.\nConstruction is underway on the waterfront house \u2014 a demolition permit was issued in August, and permits for new construction were issued in September. The 1.7-acre lot has 400 feet of bay frontage and two docks.\nIf he is charged and convicted, it\u2019s unknown what would happen to the Miami properties, which also include a condo at Asia on Brickell Key and a penthouse at Missoni Baia in Edgewater. Vorcaro was still in custody as of Wednesday.\nBanco Master has another Miami connection. Last year, it leased 26,000 square feet at 830 Brickell in Miami for $190 per square foot in rent, a record for Florida. That office is now empty.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMiami Art Week starts on Monday. We\u2019ll have a story on how the real estate industry plans to court buyers this week. Are you doing anything special? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nSurfclub 11 LLC purchased a penthouse at 9149 Collins Avenue, the Seaway North at The Surf Club, for\n$86 million\n. Miami-based\nFort Partners\n, led by Nadim Ashi, developed the property.\nCommercial:\nThe Comras Company paid\n$130.8 million\nfor a portfolio of stores along Lincoln Road and Lincoln Lane in Miami Beach. New York-based Morgan Stanley sold the properties.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nJoel Weinshanker, who leads a national collectible association and is the managing partner of Elvis Presley Enterprises, is looking to sell his waterfront mansion at 360 South Hibiscus Drive in Miami Beach\nfor $49.5 million\n. The more than 12,000-square-foot home, with seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms, was designed by Argent Design and architect Kobi Karp. It\u2019s on the market with Devin Kay of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Exclusive Group.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nWest Palm Beach saw luxury home prices\nrise 187 percent\nfrom a decade ago, the fastest growth of any major U.S. metro, according to Redfin. The median price of luxury homes in West Palm Beach is now just over $4 million.\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status for Haitians will end in early February, potentially forcing more than half a million Haitians to return to a country plagued by gang-controlled neighborhoods and high levels of hunger, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nA Tampa photojournalist was arrested while covering a protest outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in south Miami-Dade, despite wearing visible press credentials and telling police officers he was not part of the protest, the\nTampa Bay Times\nreports.\nFlorida\u2019s state-backed insurer Citizens Property Insurance has seen its policy count fall to about 439,000,\u00a0 the lowest level since 2019. Officials expect it to fall further, to roughly 385,000 by the end of the year.

        "content": "The Alexander brothers are headed to trial.\nFormer star brokers Oren and Tal, and their brother Alon have spent the last year in jail, after they were forced to trade their waterfront mansions and an apartment on New York\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row for Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center.\nSince being arrested in Miami early one December 2024 morning, the brothers have been in limbo, awaiting a verdict on the federal charges that took shape after years of rumors and whispered allegations gave way to a crush of lawsuits and investigations.\nBut the months of uncertainty are nearing an end: their long-anticipated trial before a judge and jury in the Southern District of New York is slated to commence on Jan. 5.\nThe stakes are high. The trial will deliver answers for the brothers, who are facing a minimum of 15 years in prison, and their family. But it is also hugely significant for women who say they have been drugged, sexually assaulted or raped by one of more of the brothers, some while they were minors. Beyond the attacks, some women allege the brothers have for decades used their wealth, extensive networks and played the women against each other to suppress the allegations.\nCourt filings in recent months have raised the curtain on the Alexanders\u2019 all-out defense strategy, the arguments they\u2019ll be raising in court and how the judge is preparing to hear the case.\nAll three brothers have denied the allegations.\nT\nhe allegations\nProsecutors have expanded the sex trafficking case against the three brothers since the indictment was first unsealed a year ago. The latest indictment, revealed in late November, brings the number of charges to 11.\nProsecutors accuse Tal, Oren and Alon of participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, including working together to \u201crepeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of female victims\u201d between 2008 and 2021. The indictment alleges the brothers, \u201ctogether and with others,\u201d perpetrated the scheme by inviting women to travel and stay in luxury destinations, where they were ultimately attacked.\nIn a pre-trial motion filed in November, prosecutors cited group chats where the Alexanders and other men traded graphic photos and videos of women, discussed \u201chunts\u201d and \u201ckills\u201d as they outlined the logistics for women to join them on trips, like one to Tulum. Prosecutors say in one message, Oren talks about trying \u201cludes\u201d \u2014 shorthand for quaaludes, a drug prosecutors say the brothers had on hand \u2014 along with Xanax, MDMA and GHB, to incapacitate women.\nAside from the conspiracy charge, Oren, Tal and Alon are also facing three counts of sex trafficking and one count of inducement to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Alon and Tal are charged with sex trafficking a minor victim, while Oren and Alon are charged with aggravated sexual abuse. Tal is also on the hook for two additional sex trafficking charges and another count of inducement. Oren faces a sexual exploitation of a minor charge,\nbrought\nby prosecutors in a fourth superseding indictment in November.\nWhen they were arrested last year, the twins were also charged alongside their alleged accomplice, family friend Ohad Fisherman, with sexual battery by Miami-Dade\u2019s State Attorney\u2019s Office. The state dropped the charge against Fisherman earlier this year over evidence tied to the timeline of the alleged attack. Lawyers for Oren and Alon claimed this as a win in their effort to poke holes in prosecutors\u2019 arguments and shape public perception of the case.\nBut the federal trial is a significant upscaling of the allegations aired in Miami court, with more victims and purported evidence. And the brothers have doubled down on their defense strategy.\nOren brought on attorneys Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos, who were dubbed the \u201cdream team\u201d after representing Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs against sex trafficking charges for which he was acquitted. The Alexander family hired crisis communications expert Juda Engelmayer, who also represented Diddy, and counts fraudster Anna Delvey and Harvey Weinstein among his client roster.\nThe team has largely sought to discredit accusers, accusing women of seeking financial gain by bringing allegations, and to get cases\ndismissed\nbased on time-barred claims. (One civil lawsuit against Tal was dismissed in January under those terms. Plaintiff Angelica Parker vowed to appeal.)\n\u201cFor years, a partial and often inaccurate public narrative has been built on allegations that were never proven, some of which have already been dismissed or withdrawn,\u201d a spokesperson for the Alexanders said in a statement. \u201cThe government\u2019s latest motions repeat those same disputed claims, stripped of context, and presented as if they were established fact. They are not.\u201d\n(Ed. note: The brothers filed a defamation lawsuit against The Real Deal, seeking $500 million in damages.)\nN\new details emerge\nProsecutors have indicated that a crucial tenet of their case lies in disturbing video evidence of alleged sexual assaults, obtained when authorities searched Tal\u2019s apartment at 432 Park Avenue in early January 2025.\nOne video recorded in 2009 shows Oren allegedly sexually assaulting another person who appears to be \u201cseverely intoxicated and incapacitated.\u201d During the alleged assault, Oren moved her body and had sex with the victim, who \u201cdid not actively participate,\u201d according to the filing.\n\u201cWhen the victim spoke, her words were so badly slurred that it is difficult to understand what she is saying, making clear that she was too incapacitated to consent to any sexual activity,\u201d prosecutors say.\nThe pretrial motion laid bare a new raft of details around the allegations included in the charges Oren, Tal and Alon will face at trial, including multiple victims who were minors when they were allegedly attacked by one or more of the brothers.\nThe accounts, which range in detail, add to what prosecutors say was a common pattern.\nProsecutors have described other instances in which women say they started feeling strange after accepting drinks from the brothers, in some cases losing consciousness, and then being raped by one or more of the brothers, along with other men.\n\u201cAs much as defendants want to characterize the charged conduct as just men behaving badly, this is not what the indictment charges. The charges are that three grown men conspired to entice women and girls to travel in interstate foreign commerce, to provide things of value to those women and girls, and to use force and drugs in order to have sexual contact with those victims.\u201d\nJudge Valerie E. Caproni\nThe earliest allegation prosecutors included in a recent filing is from 2009, when women invited to celebrate Oren and Alon\u2019s birthday were brought from Manhattan to the Hamptons by a party bus. After arriving at a rental house, one of the women says she was given a drink by Alon while in a hot tub. The drink made her feel tired, and Alon held her down in the hot tub and raped her as she told him to stop, prosecutors allege. The same night, the woman saw Tal having sex with a woman who was crying.\nOne of the more detailed allegations centers on a woman who says she met Tal on Instagram before he invited her and a friend to the Hamptons in 2014. He allegedly told the woman that he would reimburse flights for her and her friend and book them a hotel room, only for them to end up in a waterfront mansion with Oren and two friends, given a room with a door that did not lock. The next night, the woman says she noticed her friend \u201cbegan acting erratically\u201d after consuming half of a glass of wine.\nShe took her friend to their room, where she piled luggage to block the door. But Tal came in, jumped on the bed and asked if she had been drinking. She said yes, even though she had not, and Tal left. Too nervous to sleep, she again tried to block the door with luggage and stayed awake. A couple of hours later, two men who she believed were Tal and Oren entered. When the woman asked them, \u201cCan I help you,\u201d she heard one of them say, \u201cOh shit,\u201d before they left, according to prosecutors.\nEarly the next morning, they were packing to leave when Tal came into their room. The woman says Tal, upset she was leaving, tackled her onto the bed, and she pushed him off. But his demeanor shifted, and he became angry. He chased her into the bathroom, where she says he cornered her in the shower and raped her.\nShe says she tried to scream but couldn\u2019t raise her voice and instead whispered \u201cno, no, no.\u201d As he left her crying in the shower, he repeated \u201cYou wanted that,\u201d and \u201cI care about you.\u201d\nT\nhe Alexanders\u2019 new A-Team\nAs their legal battle forges on, the Alexander family has put on a united front \u2014 for the most part.\nTheir parents, Orly and Shlomy, have been fixtures at hearings in New York and Miami and a driving force in determining the brothers\u2019 next legal moves. They have publicly stood by their sons as others previously in their inner circles tried to distance themselves from the family.\nTal\u2019s estranged wife, Arielle Alexander, alleged in court documents that Shlomy and Orly \u201cchanged on a dime\u201d when they found out she\u2019d filed to divorce Tal, despite her assurances that she wanted to separate \u201camicably and quietly.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I told [Orly], she was not understanding,\u201d Arielle claimed in court documents. Orly \u201ctold me I should be standing by my husband, and questioned my morals, among other disrespectful statements she made to me.\u201d\nArielle also alleged the Alexanders\u2019 parents \u201cbegan to terrorize, harass and scare me, acting as their son\u2019s agent and proxy from federal prison.\u201d She accused Shlomy and Orly of barging into the Billionaires\u2019 Row apartment she previously shared with Tal and stealing multiple watches, wines and other luxury goods, along with $50,000 in cash that belonged to Arielle.\nAfter their sons\u2019 arrest in December, Shlomy and Orly appeared prepared to throw the entirety of their wealth in a bid to secure their release on house arrest \u2014 a request federal judges have repeatedly denied, citing prosecutors\u2019 arguments that they pose a flight risk and danger to the community.\nAt the time, the parents suggested their assets, combined with those of their sons, were worth about $1 billion. The family assets include Shlomy and Orly\u2019s waterfront home in Bal Harbour, the office building where their security company, Kent Security, is headquartered, plus homes in Israel and the Bahamas. The family also owns a 48-acre ranch near Aspen, Colorado.\nAs legal bills pile up, Shlomy has tried to sell\nsome of his sons\u2019 properties\n. In June, the family\nsold\nthe waterfront Miami Beach mansion where Oren lived with his wife, Kamila Hansen Alexander, before his arrest. A hidden buyer paid about $52 million for the 10,000-square-foot home. Orly signed the deed on Oren\u2019s behalf.\nThe family also tried to offload another Miami Beach property earlier this year, this one belonging to an LLC tied to Alon. The property at 969 West 34th Street, a planned Alexander Group development, hit the market in February asking $2.2 million, though it was pulled about six months later without finding a buyer, according to a Realtor.com listing. Another waterfront home was listed for rent.\nThe brothers\u2019 in-court circle appeared to expand for a November hearing to include Gil Neuman, Orly\u2019s brother and a fellow executive at the family\u2019s Kent Security firm; Alon\u2019s wife, Shani Alexander; and their oldest brother, Niv Alexander, who hadn\u2019t been spotted at previous hearings.\nAt the hearing, Judge Valerie E. Caproni raised the possibility of pushing the trial to May if outstanding issues aren\u2019t resolved before the Jan. 5 trial date. Her warning sparked an outburst from Niv, who was seated behind his parents, uncle and sister-in-law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Niv said, shaking his head in an apparent response to the potential delay.\nCourtroom security and a U.S. Marshal came over to quiet Niv, warning him and his parents that they would have to leave if they continued speaking while the judge was in the room.\nT\nrial comes into focus\nIn a decision issued in November, Caproni cleared the way for prosecutors to take the sex trafficking case to trial, rejecting most of the defense\u2019s bid to dismiss the charges. She did, however, order prosecutors to drop attempted sex trafficking from one of the charges as the statute of limitations on the 2009 allegation had already expired.\nIn her decision, Caproni pushed back on several claims from the defense, including attorneys\u2019 attempts to frame the charges as, at best, state-level \u201cdate rape.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as defendants want to characterize the charged conduct as just men behaving badly, this is not what the indictment charges,\u201d Caproni stated. \u201cThe charges are that three grown men conspired to entice women and girls to travel in interstate foreign commerce, to provide things of value to those women and girls, and to use force and drugs in order to have sexual contact with those victims.\u201d\nShe added that the indictment \u201cis not charging sexual assaults that serendipitously occurred when a group of 20- to 30-somethings [went] on vacation and one side of the romantic equation fund[ed] part of the vacation.\u201d\nShe also rejected core arguments from the defense that have come up in previous hearings, including that prosecutors\u2019 interpretation of the \u201canything of value\u201d portion of the sex trafficking statute is too broad.\n\u201cTo the extent the Defendants argue that \u2018there is no cash for sex,\u2019\u201d Caproni wrote, \u201ctheir argument is irrelevant.\u201d",

        "content": "At the party in Ibiza, Alex Sapir looked happy.\nIt was six months before he and his girlfriend, Leila Ben Khalifa, welcomed their daughter, and they were surrounded by their friends, models and Burning Man enthusiasts in fringe and crowns.\nFrom appearances, the question of his dwindling real estate portfolio was not on Sapir\u2019s mind that night in July of 2023. In a photo since removed from her Instagram carousel, Ben Khalifa is grinning, her head turned toward Sapir. He wears a block-printed cardigan tunic and a smile more mild than hers.\n\u201cMy heart is full of joy and gratitude remembering this magical night,\u201d Ben Khalifa posted when she shared images of the event a month later.\nSapir had been dealing with problems for years. These included a divorce from his wife, Yanina (initiated three years earlier, and ongoing), as well as\ntax liabilities\nand\nfamily feuds\nin the business he inherited from his father, Tamir Sapir, a Georgian immigrant who\u2019d famously gone from driving a cab to owning Manhattan properties like\n11 Madison Avenue\n, 100 Church Street and 50 Murray Street.\nBut at the time of the party, the scion seemed to be on a new path, living between Paris with\nBen Khalifa\nand Miami, where he had a\nsuccessful project in Arte Surfside\n, a luxury boutique condo development. Early comers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had helped draw buyers, and all the units were sold. In New York, he had a long-term tenant at 2 Broadway, an office building his father bought in 1995 that is leased to the Metropolitan Transit Authority until 2048.\nYet issues started mounting again, personally and with the properties. He is now selling off three of his last remaining properties in New York and South Florida, suggesting that under his leadership, the family\u2019s property play may no longer be a generational one.\nSapir declined to be interviewed for this story and only provided a brief statement through a spokesperson. He is still dealing with his contentious divorce, and sources say he split with Ben Khalifa, who has edited her Instagram page in what appears to be an attempt to downplay their relationship: altering captions and removing some images of him.\nTwo of the properties \u2014 the Nomo Soho at 9 Crosby Street and a development site in Miami \u2014 are owned by his troubled company,\nSapir Corp\n, which Israeli bondholders are coming after for $155 million in debt. He\u2019s also parted with one valuable asset,\n260 Madison Avenue\n, which had been owned by the 35-year-old family real estate company, Sapir Organization.\nSo far he is holding onto the nearby office building at\n261 Madison\n, possibly for a condo conversion.\nH\nospitality play\nSapir Corp\u2019s unraveling has been years in the making, and the story of its collapse runs straight through the ivy-covered entrance of the Nomo Soho hotel.\nSapir and fashion executive Gerard Guez scooped up the 264-key boutique hotel in 2015 for $200 million at a foreclosure sale, paying a premium for a trophy property in a hot submarket. For a while, the bet looked savvy. By 2017, Israeli stock-exchange filings valued the hotel at $246.3 million. A year later, Sapir bought out most of Guez\u2019s stake, bringing Sapir Corp\u2019s ownership to 99 percent. In 2019, Goldman Sachs provided a $115 million refinancing.\nThen the bottom fell out.\nCovid hammered the hotel, sending occupancy to 1.9 percent in April 2020 and forcing Sapir to pour in his own capital just to keep operations going. He never invested in upgrades, and the hotel\u2019s condition deteriorated. The valuation dipped to $179 million. Sapir took out an $89 million Israeli bond-market loan in 2022 that replaced the Goldman Sachs mortgage.\nMeanwhile, debts mounted and the property continued to bleed cash. Sapir Corp cut management fees and quietly shopped the hotel last year, but never found a buyer.\n\u201cThey actually injected a huge amount in the company and its assets.\u201d\nAlon Binyamini, one of the trustees overseeing Sapir Corp\u2019s liquidation\nThis summer, the company was scrambling for extensions as debt obligations came due. Sapir agreed to inject $14 million of his own capital to postpone the maturity date. But as the initial July 1 payment approached, Sapir informed bondholders he wouldn\u2019t be able to cover it, triggering a default.\nSapir Corp entered insolvency proceedings, telling a Tel Aviv court that it could no longer meet bond payments or cover basic operating costs. All of its directors resigned, and several trustees are now overseeing the wind-down of the firm, which has just two remaining assets: Nomo Soho and the Miami site, a 1.5-acre assemblage in Edgewater, near Wynwood, which Sapir and his partners relisted in July for $41 million, though Sapir said the asking price was closer to $50 million.\n\u201cThey actually injected a huge amount in the company and its assets,\u201d Alon Binyamini, one of the trustees overseeing the liquidation, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a typical insolvent company where we see that the controlling shareholder took money from the company. I don\u2019t think this is the case. They were the opposite.\u201d\nSapir Corp placed Nomo Soho into bankruptcy and will run a court-supervised auction of the hotel to pay down the company\u2019s remaining $155 million in\ndebt\nacross two Israeli bond series. It has lined up Israeli hospitality chain Dan Hotels to purchase the property for $125 million. If no higher bidder emerges, Dan will be the new owner of a property once seen as the crown jewel of Sapir\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cFacing the ongoing challenges in the market and slow recovery from two years of Covid, during which the operation was supported with significant equity, we chose to support a process that is the most likely to result in the full payment of the debt to the bond holders,\u201d a Sapir spokesperson said.\nThe liquidation may not be the end of the saga. The bondholders can still go after Sapir personally for the $14 million he promised them.\nT\nwin trophies\nA few blocks south of Grand Central, 260 and 261 Madison Avenue flank the street like walls of a glass-and-metal canyon. The pair of 1950s-era buildings were trophy holdings of the Sapir empire for nearly three decades, though the company struggled on and off with its 1 million square feet of office space.\nAlex is now parting ways with half the pair. Tamir bought both in 1997.\nThe Sapir Organization in October struck a deal to sell the 22-story, 570,000-square-foot 260 Madison Avenue to Jonathan Bennett\u2019s AmTrustRE for $270 million.\nSapir will hold onto 261 Madison \u2014 the taller of the two, with a more pronounced, set-back tower section.\nAt 261, a strap lifting a heavy heating and air conditioning unit in 2015 snapped and damaged the building, which caused the property\u2019s CMBS loan to be watchlisted by its servicer. The loan was flagged again in 2019 due to increasing operating expenses caused by climbing real estate taxes and repair-and-maintenance costs.\nIt was watchlisted one last time in 2022 ahead of its June maturity date. Sapir refinanced the properties at the end of the year with a $326 million loan from JPMorgan Chase and Mack Real Estate Group.\nThe law firm McLaughlin &amp; Stern and the executive Solomon-Page Group lease 260 Madison, and 261 is where the Sapir Organization has its office.\nBut there have been challenges with other tenants.\nThe short-term office provider Knotel (which Sapir had invested in as part of a $70 million funding round in 2018) took 45,000 square feet at 261 Madison Avenue through a management deal that year. But Knotel filed for bankruptcy in 2021, and it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s come of the space.\nWeWork also signed a lease in the building for 44,000 square feet in 2012, but by 2021 Sapir claimed the company stopped paying its rent. Sapir sued the co-working firm and its controversial co-founder Adam Neumann for $17 million, saying he only learned that WeWork planned to walk away from its lease when he read about it in The Real Deal.\nThe 261 Madison location was one of the leases WeWork rejected when it went through its own bankruptcy in 2023, and the two sides settled their lawsuit this past September. The space is now occupied by Industrious.\nThe building, 28 stories and 384,000 square feet, is the one sources said the company may convert into residential condos, although no plans have been finalized. Sapir Organization notes on its website that it expects to expand the Arte brand he launched in Surfside, with potential projects in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, per the company website.\nThe resort-style, oceanfront Surfside development, a 12-story, 16-unit building where the Trump-Kushners rented an apartment, sold out for a combined $225 million in 2023. While the project was seen as a success, Sapir is still dealing with a lawsuit brought by billionaire buyer Ramzi Musallam alleging construction defects in his penthouse. A trial is set for next summer.\nSapir doesn\u2019t appear to have plans for another Miami project.\nR\nags and riches\nTamir Sapir was the classic American rags-to-riches story.\nA refugee from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, he immigrated to New York in 1976 and scratched out a living as a yellow cab driver before he parlayed his Soviet contacts into lucrative fertilizer and oil contracts and, eventually, invested in real estate.\nIn 2003 he bought the 30-story Art Deco office tower at 11 Madison Avenue for $675 million, followed by the Duke Semans Mansion on the Upper East Side for $44 million in 2006.\nHis net worth peaked at $2 billion in 2007. By 2010, when Forbes profiled him, he had fallen off their billionaire\u2019s list and was worth about $700 million, or perhaps less. Alex was already at the helm, and in a lawsuit brought by a Las Vegas partner, he claimed the firm was $250 million in debt.\nTamir seemed to indicate he had stepped back.\n\u201cMy son is doing the business,\u201d Tamir said in court, per Forbes. \u201c\u2018Papa, give me money,\u2019 and that\u2019s it. I am the money man. Why am I expected to know so much?\u201d\nWhen Tamir died in 2014, his family was left with a huge tax bill.\nTamir was survived by his first wife, Bella, and their three children, Alex, Ruth and Zina. With his second wife, Elana, he had a daughter, Zita, and a son, Eli, who was born after his death.\nThe estate paid the Internal Revenue Service $153 million in 2015 and 2018, but late last year Alex filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking a $92 million refund on those payments.\nAlex said in the lawsuit that the estate had been unable to claim deductions for several pending claims against it. One of those was a $102 million claim bought by Rotem Rosen, who was married to Zina for 12 years before they divorced in 2019.\nRosen said he was owed money for his role in selling 11 Madison Avenue and Tribeca House, at 50 Murray Street and 53 Park Place.\nSapir and Rosen settled their suit in 2022, and in court papers Alex wrote that the rest of the claims were settled in 2024.\nHe said the estate had filed for a refund claim in April, but heard nothing from the IRS.\n\u201cThe Estate is being strained with maturities of its term debt and other cash flow requirements which cannot be addressed until the refund is received,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis imposes a severe hardship on the estate and is causing it financial injury and injury to its reputation and credit rating as a result of the IRS\u2019s unexcused delay.\u201d\n\u201cThe injuries are increasing daily.\u201d\nThe case is ongoing. Between the bills, suits, sales and remaining holdings, it is difficult to get an overall financial picture of Sapir Organization.\nL\nife of parties\nThroughout, Sapir seemed to find some separation from the drama in the courts and the buildings. He got into hospitality ventures with Rosen; both were part of a group that brought Zuma, a restaurant hotspot in 261 Madison, and the viral \u201cSalt Bae\u201d steakhouse to New York.\nHe also seemed in his element at Burning Man, where he was affiliated with a group called Monkey Camp. Photos from its account show him there with his wife in 2020. Later, he went with Ben Khalifa, and he\u2019s pictured in a pair of elaborately patterned harem pants, two braids in his beard. He\u2019s often seen wearing layers of necklaces including one that holds his vape.\nDuring the past two years with Ben Khalifa, a model and businesswoman, he attended splashier events: the Met Gala, Cannes Film Festival and Art Basel.\nHe continues to shed properties. Sapir\u2019s divorce from Yanina is still pending more than three years after she filed, and the estranged couple has one major asset left to sell: their waterfront Venetian Islands estate in Miami Beach, which is asking $38 million.Earlier this year, they sold their adjacent waterfront home on the Venetians to Shark Tank investor Rohan Oza for $9.8 million. The 60,000-square-foot home on 8 acres on the waterfront in Great Neck\u2019s King Point owned by his father has also been on the market, listed for as high as $100 million, though more recently for $45 million.\nPartying and personal trouble don\u2019t disqualify anyone from real estate, and without Sapir\u2019s responses, it\u2019s hard to know where his luck ran out and where his skill, or drive, didn\u2019t pick up.\nBut according to his spokesperson, the family business \u2014 Sapir Organization \u2014 isn\u2019t going away, despite the troubles with Sapir Corp.\n\u201cGiven that Sapir Corp was focused on a few assets for some of the Sapir family members and never owned by the Sapir Organization or part of its legal structure, Sapir Organization will continue operations as it always has for 3.5 decades,\u201d the Sapir spokesperson said.",

        "content": "Things were not good for multifamily investor Patrick Carroll \u2014 that much the industry knew.\nHis volatility had been so public. He\u2019d fired guns from his boat and reamed out employees at car dealerships and restaurants. Then, two days before the Fourth of July in 2024, a Los Angeles news chopper caught him on camera fleeing from the police. After years of unstable behavior, this was his first clear step into the abyss. Footage from the chase shows a phalanx of officers swarming a tall man in an unbuttoned light-colored shirt and dark slacks. The cops had pulled him over and pursued him down an embankment near a Los Angeles highway. Carroll pretended to surrender, but then just took off.\nWhen they finally caught him, police officers reportedly found two discarded weapons, a machete and a gun.\nCarroll\nhas been one of the country\u2019s most successful multifamily syndicators since the 2010s. Self-made, not only did he lack family wealth, but he hadn\u2019t even gone to college. His path had not been smooth: There\nwere\narrests, lawsuits, restraining orders and a messy divorce, and in retrospect, the particulars of these cases anticipated what happened later. But by buying into the Sun Belt boom early, he\u2019d managed to do $9 billion in transactions by age 40.\nIn 2023, he seemed to reach an apex, selling his Atlanta-based namesake firm, Carroll Organization, to RMR Group for\n$80 million\n.\nOn the other side of the sale lay a bleak period.\n\u201cBeing in retirement, having nothing to do, sitting in my pool in Miami was not good for me,\u201d Carroll said in an interview with The Real Deal publisher Amir Korangy at the\n2025 Miami Real Estate Forum\nlast month. Since the sale to RMR, he\u2019s been adhering to a non-compete agreement, which expires on Jan. 1, 2027. It forced him to the sidelines in business. But his mind was going a million miles an hour, he said.\nIn March of 2024, just nine months after the RMR deal, he \u201cwent into a full-blown manic attack,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly, there\u2019s a lot of it that I don\u2019t remember.\u201d It turned out to be bipolar disorder, which had not yet been diagnosed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a grandiosity that you have,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cEverybody else around you notices it, but going through it, you don\u2019t notice your poor judgment. I didn\u2019t give a sh*t.\u201d Bizarre episodes followed, and his troubles made headlines for months.\nBy that July, he was fleeing the Los Angeles police, who eventually arrested Carroll and charged him with three felonies: carrying a loaded firearm in public; fleeing a police vehicle and driving against traffic; and a disregard for safety by eluding an officer.\nBut Carroll, now 46, said he is back on track. His candor in front of thousands was his way of normalizing mental health struggles, he said, making them okay to talk about. But he also wanted to underscore his newfound equanimity, to tell the audience that he was better and to position himself for a return to the industry when the non-compete expires. Carroll said that he still owns a stake in 20,000 apartment units.\nIn April, he\nentered\na prosecution diversion program by agreeing to undergo mental health counseling for two years.\nT\nhe rise of a\nm\nultifamily mogul\nCarroll grew up in Tampa, from \u201cnot a lot of money,\u201d he said. He started flipping homes in the Southeast U.S. when he moved to Atlanta after graduating from high school. He developed and sold a 150-unit apartment project in Atlanta when he was 27, using the profits to buy three property management companies that oversaw 22,000 apartment units.\nHe began a sharper ascent in 2010, when he started raising capital from such institutional investors as Carlyle Group. \u201cIt was a big deal for me to get joint venture capital\u201d back then, he said.\nCarroll Organization became a multifamily sponsor that partnered with institutional investors to buy properties in the Sun Belt. The company also managed the properties in-house. In 2022, the year before Carroll sold the company, Carroll Organization acquired 14 multifamily projects with 5,000 units for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion, and sold 23 properties with nearly 8,500 apartments for a total sale price of $2.2 billion, according to the firm\u2019s annual report.\nTRD\nfirst picked up on him\nin 2015\n, when he signed two mortgages totaling $84 million for a $112 million purchase of the 812-unit Resort at Laguna Lakes in West Palm Beach.\n\u201cThe Sun Belt market welcomes guys like me with open arms,\u201d he said at the Forum.\nAt the time, multifamily real estate was still dominated by mom-and-pop operators, and the institutionalization of the sector was just beginning.\n\u201cEverybody else around you notices it, but going through it, you don\u2019t notice your poor judgment. I didn\u2019t give a sh*t.\u201d\nPatrick Carroll\nCarroll saw the trend early and positioned himself at the forefront, building a platform that would eventually buy and sell more than 90,000 units across the region, generating average investment returns of 25 percent over a three-and-a-half-year hold period, he said.\u200b\n\u201cEverybody thought the Sun Belt was red neck,\u201d he said. Pre-Covid, when he\u2019d go up to New York, he remembered, \u201cI\u2019d be wearing a Kiton suit, and [because of the type of properties I was investing in] they thought I was a red neck in a pickup truck.\u201d\nBut when pandemic shifts sent people packing from New York and California to some of the locations where his portfolio was \u2014 Texas, Florida and the Carolinas \u2014 Carroll spied the deadline for the early-bird special.\n\u201cI was screaming at my investors, \u2018We have to sell!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I thought things were going to fall off a cliff. I just said, things can\u2019t get much better, so why not take profits?\u201d\nThe ability to spot\nmarket inflection points\nearned him a reputation as a visionary, even as his brash style alienated some in the industry.\u200b\n\u201cWe would buy a billion a year,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019d go do a victory lap in New York and tell potential new investors, \u2018I\u2019m making so much money with Carlyle, you really should partner with me.\u2019\u201d\nC\nrashing out\nLike the rest of the world, Carroll signed up for Instagram sometime in the late 2010s. Although the platform isn\u2019t to blame for his problems, it did allow others to see them.\nBeginning in 2023, shortly before selling his company, Carroll would occasionally go on rampages, sometimes documenting the incidents himself. Last spring, he filmed and posted videos of himself berating customer service employees at a Bentley car dealership and an Apple store. Carroll also posted inflammatory comments about other prominent Miamians on social media, threatened attorneys and engaged in public confrontations that contradicted his image of a disciplined dealmaker.\nIn the months around his arrest in Los Angeles, Carroll found himself in trouble with law enforcement in other jurisdictions.\nIn March of last year, Carroll posted a video on his account that showed him on his boat docked in his backyard. He clutched a shotgun, sported a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and a white towel draped over his shoulders. From the boat\u2019s bow, Carroll fired off a couple of rounds that he later claimed were blanks when police officers showed up at his house after neighbors called the authorities.\nDays later,\nMiami Beach Police\nobtained a court order forcing Carroll to undergo a three-day involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Officers also confiscated his firearms during his hospital stay. Following his release, Carroll told\nTRD\nat the time that doctors gave him a clean bill of health.\nEight months later, cops arrested Carroll in\nWyoming\non an outstanding warrant for felony aggravated stalking because he had allegedly violated a 15-day temporary restraining order to stay away from his ex-wife, Lindsey Truex. In November, a Florida prosecutor dropped the charge after determining that Carroll had called\nTruex\nafter the restraining order had expired.\nCarroll also recently privately settled three civil lawsuits against him in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court and Los Angeles Superior Court. The two cases in Miami involved a restaurant manager,\nMiguelangel Weill\n, and a videographer, Roberto Gatica. Weill alleged that Carroll defamed him by falsely accusing him of extortion via a spokesperson. Carroll got into a confrontation with Weill at a Wynwood sushi spot in 2023. The incident allegedly ended with Carroll spitting at Weill.\nGatica sued Carroll for breach of contract and civil battery tied to a video assignment in March 2024 that turned ugly. Carroll allegedly contracted Gatica through an agency to shoot video content for the mogul\u2019s Instagram account. Gatica alleged that Carroll verbally insulted him, including calling him a \u201cfat motherf*cker,\u201d and pushed him when he decided to leave and quit the assignment.\nThe Los Angeles lawsuit was filed by two ex-body guards who accused Carroll of civil assault, battery, false imprisonment, wrongful termination and creating a hostile work environment.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d never heard of Instagram and put all that out,\u201d Carroll admitted at the Forum. \u201cI look back on it and I see things that I posted, or I read articles, and I cringe.\u201d\u200b\nR\noad to redemption\nToday, Carroll uses his Instagram account, which has 1.1 million followers, to repair his image and be an outspoken advocate for mental health awareness. Flashy videos of him shopping for designer goods in Miami\u2019s Design District have been replaced with clips of Carroll sharing his knowledge on real estate and other investments. He still posts images and clips of him with his three sons and engaging in his favorite philanthropic endeavor, handing out free sneakers to children at the Boys and Girls Club.\n\u201cIf I just sat back, and the last thing you ever read about me was the stuff that was in Page Six and other stuff, nobody would know any different,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cSo I\u2019m on Instagram every day. I\u2019m showing people, you know, I\u2019m changed.\u201d\u200b\nCarroll\u2019s plan for 2027 is ambitious. He intends to build a new investment platform, hiring former Blackstone executives and other top talent to run the day-to-day operations while he focuses on strategy and capital raising. \u201cI want Carroll 2.0 to be the Navy Seals of what it was before,\u201d he said.\nCarroll remains confident that institutional investors will see past his controversies. \u201cSmart investors invest to make money, and I\u2019m a proven money maker,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been arrested or in trouble for anything based on integrity, never anything financially related and never anything that\u2019s affected my business. Mine were self-inflicted wounds. I think people are going to [say], \u201cHe went through a rough period of time, but he got the best help he could.\u2019\u201d\nAs Carroll prepares for his next chapter, he\u2019s determined to prove that redemption is possible. \u201cI\u2019m going to come out of the gate in 2027,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty positive I can do $500 million to $1 billion worth of acquisitions. This is the phase I call, \u2018waving my ass around.\u2019\u201d",

        "content": "Deep in Palm Beach County, out where the suburbs meet the swamp, dirt has turned to gold.\nThe miracle has unfolded behind the guarded gates of Stone Creek Ranch, a community in an unincorporated part of the county near Delray Beach, where just 37 homes occupy 187 acres. It is about as far inland as one can go before reaching the Everglades.\nIt is one of dozens of gated communities that have sprung from the earth where sugarcane and bell peppers once grew. With names like Seven Bridges, Stonebridge, and Boca Bridges, these are places where well-heeled buyers can pick up a house for $1 or $2 million.\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Stone Creek was much like its neighbors \u2014 nice, but hardly noteworthy.\nBut the gated community is now a magnet for record-breaking deals and billionaire buyers.\nThe once-anonymous development has recently had its name in headlines about its new high-profile owners. In October, the multi-hyphenate\nMark Wahlberg\ndropped $32.6 million on a gut-renovated 17,800-square-foot mansion on 2.7 acres. With seven bedrooms, a theater, wine room, gym, sauna, cigar lounge, guest house and pool, it\u2019s a boilerplate home by Stone Creek standards.\nHis purchase triggered a rush for homes in the neighborhood, according to Talbot Sutter, the broker and owner of Sutter &amp; Nugent.\n\u201cEverything in Stone Creek basically went under contract after Mark Wahlberg bought that house,\u201d he said \u2014 including one of his listings.\nThat it has been catapulted to the absolute upper echelons of South Florida\u2019s luxury real estate market puzzles Sutter\u2019s colleagues in more established markets. Palm Beach agents well acquainted with courting the same billionaire crowd wonder why in hell would luxury buyers spend this kind of money in what is, from their view, the boonies.\nYes, there are more centrally located neighborhoods with better access to prestigious clubs, hot restaurants and the ocean, but that is not what Stone Creek\u2019s buyers want. These buyers prioritize\nsafety\nand\nprivacy\nabove all else, which can deter them from Palm Beach, where anyone can come and go unsurveilled. Stone Creek residents are people who want (and have) high-tech safe rooms with reinforced steel.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rise is also closely linked to the South Florida wealth migration catalyzed by the pandemic. Buyers suddenly flooded the market with a flipped set of values and needs: mainly, isolation and the livability of a full-time home rather than a warm weather pied-\u00e0-terre.\n\u201cStone Creek Ranch checked every box,\u201d Rockstar Energy founder Russell Weiner said: size, price, privacy and amenities.\n\u201cWhy in the hell that location, I have no clue.\u201d\nTalbot Sutter, Sutter &amp; Nugent on his first impression of the site\nBillionaire Weiner, who legally changed his last name to Savage, is a prolific luxury real estate investor. Shortly after Wahlberg\u2019s purchase, he went into contract on\ntwo\nStone Creek\nhomes\n, one at 16071 Quiet Vista Circle asking $20.9 million and another at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane asking $22 million.\nThese are remarkable prices for non-waterfront homes, but still fall short of the neighborhood\u2019s price record.\nIn January, a member of the Cafaro family bought a 2.5-acre spec estate for $41.5 million. The Cafaros own their namesake development company, a Niles, Ohio-based firm best known for pioneering the American mall concept. They named their nearly 19,600-square-foot megamansion Casa Maranello for the Italian city where Ferraris are produced. It has a 12-car garage, 12-seat theater, salon facilities, a soccer field, sport court and putting green. Though the sale recorded with the county as $41.5 million, including furniture and other personal items, the total was $55 million, according to listing agent Senada Ad\u017eem of Douglas Elliman.\nThe new buyers are not the first to discover Stone Creek. The Weeknd shopped around the neighborhood, and billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen bought a 31,000-square-foot mansion there in 2021. But as much as this inland compound of megamansions seemed to spring to prominence overnight, its ascendancy was 25 years in the making.\nAd\u017eem has been selling homes in Stone Creek since 2018. She remembers when the average sales price hovered in the $6 million range.\n\u201cIt was not known unless you were local,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of prestige now to be able to live in Stone Creek Ranch.\u201d\nC\nane fields and dirt roads\nSutter, a born-and-bred Palm Beach County local whose grandfather was one of the area\u2019s first real estate agents, got licensed straight after graduating from the Benjamin School in 2007. Not long after, he met Ken Endelson, the founder of homebuilder Kenco Communities. Endelson had created the Stone Creek subdivision in 2000, envisioning an exclusive enclave of massive estates. Unlike its neighbors, there would be no golf course, no clubhouse and no communal tennis courts. Just a small concentration of enormous, private homes.\nThe surrounding land was just \u201ccane fields and peppers. The 441 was still a dirt road,\u201d Sutter said. \u201cWhy in the hell that location, I have no clue.\u201d\nSutter was incredulous, but Endelson spoke of a grand future where Stone Creek would be a hub for the global elite. The hitch was that Kenco had hit a rough patch in the financial crisis, and Endelson needed buyers. Some of the planned homes were built and spoken for, but much of Stone Creek was still dirt. In 2009, he sold 19 remaining lots to an affiliate of Axiom Group for $10.1 million, according to property records. In the years that followed, Axiom sold off the lots and buyers filled in the blanks with custom-built megamansions inside the community.\nDespite the economic trouble and relative youth of Stone Creek, well-connected buyers emerged. Wayne Huizenga Jr. bought a 5-acre site for $1 million in 2009. He built the mansion and sold it to Office Depot CEO Gerry Smith for $6.7 million in 2017. Huizenga is the son of late billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga, who built Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, Extended Stay America and AutoNation.\nInsurance moguls Seth and Brad Cohen of Insurance Care Direct also built homes they eventually sold for $17 million and $19 million, respectively. They bought their sites for $800,000 and $900,000.\nMarket insiders said these buyers had a snowball effect \u2014 big names begot more big names.\nThe 2020 set found even more to like. They wanted space, security and all their creature comforts under one roof, as well as new construction. Buyers liked that there was no club component to the community, as it meant no club dues, no club politics and no club employees coming and going, agents said.\n\u201cTheir whole thing is their house is their club house,\u201d Sutter said, describing in-home spas in some houses that \u201cmake the Ritz-Carlton look like child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\u201cThese homes are so big and gnarly with every bell and whistle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nT\nhe Starkification\no\nf Stone Creek\nThere is one man who is responsible for building Stone Creek\u2019s biggest, gnarliest, every-bell-and-whistle homes:\nAldo Stark\n. The founder of Prestige Design Homes, he flipped the mansion to Wahlberg, built the Cafaro family\u2019s Casa Maranello and erected a James Bond-inspired spec estate dubbed Villa Spectre, which he sold for $36.8 million to retired tech CEO Barry Smith last December.\nHe is known for building massive homes at breakneck speeds, often with a style best described as high drama. The press-shy builder is pictured bearded, in large, dark shades and a pinstriped suit on his website, lending itself to the flash and intrigue he cultivates.\n\u201cThey were very bold and daring,\u201d Ad\u017eem said of Casa Maranello and Villa Spectre. \u201cThat is a hallmark of Stark\u2019s vision.\u201d\nAd\u017eem is Stark\u2019s go-to agent for his spec homes in Stone Creek, and she helped sell him the lots for those homes. She sees Stark\u2019s arrival in the neighborhood as the moment it blew through its previous price ceiling.\n\u201cWe were able to offer a new level of product,\u201d she said.\nStark\u2019s homes are fueling the continued interest from Stone Creek\u2019s A-list buyers. Weiner equated the neighborhood to Beverly Park in Los Angeles, a gated community known for large estates, celebrity homes and guarded entrances. It has some peers in Palm Beach County as well. The Bears Club in Jupiter, home to Michael Jordan, is extremely private and secure. Similar to Stone Creek, it has fewer than 55 single-family homes across its 400 acres, although it does have a golf club and a few smaller villas for members. Edward Brown, the former CEO of Patr\u00f3n Spirits, sold his Bears Club mansion for a record $48 million this year.\nThe success of these gated enclaves is providing inspiration for a new crop of golf communities shooting up farther north in Hobe Sound, like the Discovery Land Company\u2019s Atlantic Fields. The planned community will have 317 homes on more than 1,500 acres, according to its website. And it will, of course, be gated.\nStill, the staying power of such projects has yet to be tested, and so much depends upon the buyers who ultimately commit to spend there. Part of the value of Stone Creek is in its owners, and their own devotion to maintaining property values, said Sutter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mansion banking,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to be protected. There is billionaire after billionaire in there who is not going to let their house go under $2,000 a foot.\u201d\nFor Weiner, it\u2019s a safe investment, but the estates in Stone Creek also provide what money can\u2019t buy in other parts of South Florida.\n\u201cCompared to Palm Beach island or Miami Beach, it\u2019s a steal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe teardowns in Palm Beach are $200 million and this has more land. It\u2019s gated and armed and no one can drive by; what is that worth?\u201d\n\u2014Katherine Kallergis contributed reporting",

        "content": "On the edge of Miami-Dade County\u2019s built world, where single-family home subdivisions plateau into open expanses, sits a 90-acre tract. The land in south Miami-Dade is neatly carved into distinct uses: one parcel planted with row crops such as soybeans, another devoted to a palm tree farm, a third to an avocado orchard and a fourth to a nursery for a variety of plants.\nHere, developers Salim and Kamil Chraibi plan roughly 500 townhomes and 76 large single-family homes lining the perimeter of the property. Every home will be capped at workforce prices and 20 percent of units will be reserved for households earning no more than 140 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s $87,200 median income.\n\u201cWe are building townhomes that are barn style \u2026 that would match the agricultural style around,\u201d Salim said, showing a rendering of the barn-like fa\u00e7ades with steep pitched metal roofs.\nThe project embodies the Chraibis\u2019 niche: developing workforce housing in south Miami-Dade.\nBluenest Development, the Miami-based firm which Salim founded in 2018 and Kamil, the younger brother, joined about a year later, has seized on the rich supply of cheaper land in the south county area and on the high demand for housing priced below market rate.\nIt\u2019s hardly the only firm leaning into this play. During the recent years\u2019 boom in demand due to an influx of out-of-staters, developers rushed to south Dade, the county\u2019s last frontier for housing development, but Bluenest far outpaced many of its contemporaries.\nThey \u201care very aggressive and they do what they say they are going to do. \u2026 They built a very good reputation in a short amount of time,\u201d said Jason Bass, who last year was part of a partnership that sold a\n20-acre development site\nin Homestead to Bluenest. \u201cThe dealings I\u2019ve had with Bluenest \u2026 they never ask for any extensions [to land acquisition closing] or concessions that are much to speak of.\u201d\nThe numbers show the momentum. Bluenest\u2019s portfolio is heavily concentrated in the southern part of the county and includes 1,000 completed homes and a pipeline of about 3,000 homes in various stages of approval and development, according to the firm.\nAs South Florida quickly turned into a buyer\u2019s market over the past year, the Chraibis\u2019 target demographic of buyers\ninsulates them from the slowdown\n, largely because demand for below-market priced homes is\nperennial\n.\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody was willing to build high-end mansions; $10-, $15-, $20 million homes. But then when you looked at the median income, I was wondering where all of these people were living.\u201d\nSalim Chraibi, Bluenest Development\nStill, they aren\u2019t immune to the\neconomic headwinds\nthat developers are facing, including elevated materials and labor costs, and unfavorable interest rates. Not to mention lingering doubts about the long-term viability of south Miami-Dade \u2014 an area that offers farmland, strip malls and subdivisions pushing toward the Everglades but lacks the Miami allure of oceanfront views, glitzy architecture and 24/7 entertainment.\nBut Bluenest is accelerating. By the third quarter of next year, it expects to complete roughly 400 homes and start construction of nearly 600, Salim said. His ambitions are bigger.\n\u201cOur goal by 2028,\u201d he said, \u201cis to start delivering a thousand homes a year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s ambitious. In the cutthroat world of real estate, the developers who scale quickly tend to be deeply embedded in the industry. Many are born into families that already hammered out a reputation in South Florida and\ntake the reins\nfrom their\nparents\n. Others, who start out as unknowns, usually run in circles where they can tap into deep-pocketed investors.\nAs South Florida transplants, the Chraibis have none of that\u00a0 yet, scaled in less than a decade to become one of the top non-institutional workforce housing developers in south Miami-Dade.\nZ\nero to 4,000\nSalim, 36, and Kamil, 31, are newcomers to South Florida but not to real estate. Growing up in Casablanca, Morocco, the pair often joined their mother, architect and land broker Nadia Daoudi, on job sites. Their grandmother had developed homes and apartment buildings in the 1960s in the city.\n\u201cMy grandmother was always pushing everybody to be in real estate. \u2018Stick to the rock,\u2019\u201d Salim recalled her saying. \u201cWe were always attracted to real estate and it was natural in a way for us to transition because it was always something that really attracted us.\u201d\nAlthough they moved to South Florida to pursue other careers, Salim came to play golf for Johnson &amp; Wales University, intending to play the sport professionally, and Kamil went to Florida International University, planning on going into tech but real estate beckoned. The gap in housing supply hit them immediately.\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody was willing to build high-end mansions; $10-, $15-,\n$20 million homes. But then when you looked at the median income, I was wondering where all of these people were living,\u201d Salim said. \u201cQuickly, we found that there was a huge demand, that it [a home] would be on the market for a couple of days and then it would go under contract.\u201d\nFrom 2018 to 2020, they completed their first standalone homes and duplexes, including five in Miami-Dade\u2019s Brownsville and West LIttle River, and Miami\u2019s Liberty City on lots they purchased for a combined $183,100, records show.\nFinding construction loans was difficult, and Salim tried his luck with Key Biscayne-based family firm London Financial, which generally doesn\u2019t finance construction debt less than $1 million. Still, it provided Bluenest with a $650,000 construction loan in 2018 for its first few homes, records show.\nEd London, London Financial manager, just had a \u201cgut feeling\u201d about Salim after they met for lunch, he said.\n\u201cHe seemed to be a hustler and somebody with ambition,\u201d London said. \u201cYou know when someone knows what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nThe brothers credit their quick scaling to delivering on promises to their partners, and their perspective. Their immigrant background allows them to truly see the opportunities in the U.S., they said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do what we have done in any other country in the world,\u201d Salim said. \u201cYou have a big market, you have people who are buying, you have access to capital.\u201d\nThose who\u2019ve had dealings with the Chraibis have described them as \u201cworkaholics\u201d and \u201cabove-board businessmen.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s just as much about work as it is about embedding themselves in the community. Many of the foreign developers who scale in South Florida usually have financial backing from investors in their countries of origin. The Chraibis, whose father, Khalid Chraibi, died when they were young, cited some \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d during their youth. Although they started with some backing from \u201cfriends and family,\u201d they forged the majority of their investor relationships with South Florida family offices and high net worth individuals.\nAs of late, Salim also has been making the rounds at local podcasts, describing his focus on workforce housing, a topic that\u2019s bound to garner him an audience given Miami-Dade\u2019s affordability crisis.\nIt\u2019s paid off. Although Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilding giant founded over 70 years ago, has a\nmonopoly\non south Miami-Dade residential development\u00a0 thanks to its financial wherewithal and backing from the likes of Warren Buffett and massive land banks \u2014 every land use attorney and developer The Real Deal contacted for this story knew the Chraibi brothers and cited them as a major force in the area.\nBluenest is phasing out from building individual homes and focusing on communities, with their portfolio consisting of 23 complexes in various stages, from planned to completed and under construction, primarily in south Dade.\nThe townhomes have commonalities: usually spanning about 1,900 square feet with at least three bedrooms and higher-end finishes that can be found in $2 million homes, including impact windows and doors; waterfall countertops; higher ceilings; some with foyers and powder rooms, or half-baths in the foyers; and pajama rooms upstairs with couches where families can hang out.\nPrices are capped at $451,000, squarely targeting the workforce that wants to own a home in the county, where the median home price hovers at about $500,000, without sacrificing on size, yard space and finishes.\nMany of the projects are much smaller than their Krome one. Its pipeline includes: K Legacy with 57 townhomes on a 4-acre lot in Princeton, Palm Villas with 33 duplexes on another 4 acres in Naranja, Park Villas with 76 homes on 9.5 acres near Homestead and Limonar Estates with 34 duplexes on a 4.2-acre site in Naranja.\nThey are \u201cbeing very entrepreneurial because not every project can be a 300-unit project [because] there\u2019s less of that land. There\u2019s more of these smaller pieces,\u201d said land use attorney Anthony De Yurre. \u201cThe question is how do you \u2026 build out the business model. Obviously they have figured it out.\u201d\nT\nhe Chraibi code\nThe math has to math and that starts with the price of land, Kamil said.\n\u201cBecause if you buy it too expensive, it becomes impossible to create all of that unless you want to lose money in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been very careful in how we would buy.\u201d\nThey then take on the financial risk of upzoning the sites, including paying attorneys, architects and deposits for the properties, because more density allows for lower home prices.\n\u201cInstead of building K Legacy with 30 or 40 homes, we are building 57. That extra 27 is allowing us to bring workforce [prices],\u201d Salim said. \u201cVersus if we were just doing 40 single-family homes, we would sell them in the $700,000s. It\u2019s still a viable plan. But that\u2019s not really what we would like to create.\u201d\nSometimes, deals just work out. When Bluenest approached Sam Accursio, whose family has been farming in south Dade since the 1960s, seeking to purchase the Park Villas site, they didn\u2019t set a price contingent on project approval or based on appraisals. Instead, Accursio asked for $4 million, and Bluenest agreed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for 10 acres,\u201d Accursio said. \u201cI think that [$4 million] would have been the top of the market in that area at the time.\u201d\nWhile construction costs have stabilized in the last two years, though labor costs remain more of an issue, Salim said Bluenest is protecting itself as much as possible by having in-house general contractors and a proprietary tech tool to identify and evaluate prospective sites for purchase. Elevated interest rates are more of an issue, as their target buyers are concerned about their monthly payments.\nBluenest\u2019s hedge against buyers cooling to closing on homes? It works with Miami-Dade\u2019s down payment assistance programs, which provide low-interest and forgivable loans to help buyers front the money for a home. Bluenest also offers rate buydowns, and accepts FHA and VA loans.\nThe brothers don\u2019t doubt south Miami-Dade\u2019s potential, though the issue of a lack of commercial space and amenities isn\u2019t lost on them. Their Krome project will include about 10 acres of commercial space, including a grocery store, a linear park and could also have a school and padel courts, they said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit in traffic for a long time,\u201d Kamil added. \u201cSo if you can have a grocery store next to your house, if you can have green space near your house, where you can go to the gym and walk with your kids, and maybe potentially school, it saves you a lot of time.\u201d\nThe bigger obstacles, the Chraibis said, are building workforce homes quickly enough and NIMBYism.\nThe county is short nearly\n90,200 affordable units\n, Salim said, citing a report by nonprofit Miami Homes for All. Many of those who can no longer afford Miami-Dade are moving elsewhere in the state, prompting fears that South Florida is losing its workforce, the backbone that supports the tri-county region.\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who bought homes in the \u201870s and \u201880s. \u2026 You build townhomes [nearby and] they are mad,\u201d Salim said. \u201cPeople think of workforce housing as \u2018Oh, these people are going to come and they are going to destroy my neighborhood.\u2019 No, these are teachers, teaching your kids at school, these are people who show up at your door when you call 911. \u2026 [The] workforce is what makes a city.\u201d",

        "content": "Last December, a cameraman shadowed Josh Flagg as he wandered about his most recent purchase, a Mid-Century Modern home.\nIt was the early afternoon and the\nCompass\nagent had been up since about 7:30 a.m. He\u2019d had social calls with a few famous friends, plus a steady stream of Zooms about: the latest real estate acquisition by his family\u2019s business, an event he was hosting, his two-year-old real estate media firm and a bagel venture he\u2019d helped finance. Then, Flagg drove himself (he typically has a driver) to Beverly Hills to meet with the jeweler designing a pin for his tuxedo. Capping a day with no real downtime, he was off to look at plans for another house he owns on Bedford Drive.\n\u201cI love it that way,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cI can sleep when I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nThat he shared the busy day with a reporter and a tour of his home with the 3 million followers across his Estate Media\u2019s social channels can help explain what propelled Flagg onto a stage well beyond real estate.\nHe spent 15 seasons on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d where fans liked him as the Beverly Hills agent with a quick wit, exacting taste and encyclopedic knowledge of Los Angeles\u2019 most historically significant homes. The renown yielded opportunities beyond real estate \u2014 the events, the media company, the friendships with locals like Candy Spelling and Melissa Rivers.\nBut with the show now on pause, Flagg is ramping up his run at the helm of his family\u2019s business, Flagg Family Capital, a commercial real estate portfolio built by his parents and grandparents. His next act is upon him: proving he can carry on the legacy and expand into luxury markets.\nYet he comes to the job with baggage. Within the industry, he is a polarizing figure. Some scoff he\u2019s just another reality TV celebrity who can hardly be considered a market leader when it comes to selling high-end real estate. There\u2019s also the matter of the made-for-TV drama that\u2019s followed Flagg over the years: arrested for allegedly stealing art from clients (the issue was reportedly dropped due to lack of evidence),\nleaving Douglas Elliman\non contentious grounds and accusing his former boss in a\nlawsuit\nof hacking his computer (the suit later\ndropped\nthe executive as a defendant in July).\nThe spotlight has also captured moments such as Flagg\u2019s marriage to Bobby Boyd and their divorce in 2023.\nThough he has lived so much in the public eye, Flagg still seeks to guard his image. The slightest whiff of controversy can spark a swift demand letter, such as the one threatening a defamation suit sent to The Real Deal by Flagg\u2019s attorney in relation to a mention of the alleged 2008 art theft.\n\u201cWithin days of the allegations being made against my client in 2008, the Los Angeles District Attorney determined that it would not pursue any charges against my client,\u201d the letter said.\nStill, it\u2019s hard to deny that Flagg, already a well-connected Angeleno, saw an early opportunity in reality TV, and leveraged it into a career that\u2019s made him a household name with a long business runway.\n\u201cOne could look down on reality television but at the end of the day, my highest-net-worth clients watch [\u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d],\u201d he said. \u201cYou go on American Airlines or Delta, it\u2019s on the plane. It\u2019s not a reality show that\u2019s drama-based with housewives throwing wineglasses in people\u2019s faces. Everyone loves high-end houses, and everyone likes real estate porn and Los Angeles properties.\u201d\nWhile Flagg is not at the top of the heap in sales volume-based rankings, such as TRD\u2019s annual list, his name is often heard in connection with local trophy properties.\nHe was one of the listing agents on Casa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road, which was at one time asking $250 million before going off and on the market at reduced pricing. Earlier this year, he sold the Gloria Vanderbilt Estate in the Beverly Hills Flats for $16.1 million. He co-listed with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Matt Altman, his former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d co-star, the Beverly Hills home of \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d cast members Heather and Terry Dubrow. The property, at 1501 Tower Grove, sold for $16.5 million. Last month he nabbed the listing for 1436 Bella Drive, known as Falcon Lair which was originally built and owned by silent film actor Rudolph Valentino and later home to tobacco heiress Doris Duke.\nF\namily business\nFor all the high-profile estates attached to his name, residential real estate is not the family business; that\u2019s Flagg Family Capital, where he has big shoes to fill.\nFlagg\u2019s paternal grandmother was Edith Flagg, who started the ready-to-wear label Edith Flagg Inc., which is credited with being the first to import polyester to the U.S. in 1967.\nAfter apparel, Edith and Josh\u2019s father, Michael Flagg, turned their focus to real estate, purchasing a 46,000-square-foot office at 400 South Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. On the roof was a neon \u201cFlagg\u201d sign, \u201cso large, you could see it from the moon,\u201d Michael remembered. It became known as the Flagg Building and embarrassed everyone except Michael\u2019s father, who liked the attention grabber.\nJosh\u2019s mother, Cindy Flagg, is from the Platt family, one of Los Angeles\u2019 oldest Jewish families, and is also involved in real estate. Within the family\u2019s real estate portfolio were multiple properties on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, including the Platt Fine Arts Building. Josh\u2019s great-grandfather, Benjamin Platt, was also one of the founding board members of City of Hope.\n\u201cWe talk about things no one bothers with anymore \u2014 China patterns, menu sequences, whether French service is more elegant than English service.\u201d\nCandy Spelling on her friendship with Josh Flagg\nIn 2023, Michael shifted business responsibilities to Josh, who is now looking to move the focus from shopping centers and offices into the high-end spaces of New York, Miami and Palm Beach real estate.\nFor many scions, the heat would be on to make a mark on the family business, become a part of the history. Despite this switch in the business model, Josh doesn\u2019t feel it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any pressure because I don\u2019t have any kids yet and, you know, I\u2019m the only son,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m doing what I think is best and what I know how to do.\u201d\nIn doing things his way, he is reshaping the family firm\u2019s strategy.\n\u201cThere are two schools of thought: long-term appreciation versus cash flow. I have always believed in cash flow, and it took a long time for me to understand [Josh\u2019s] mentality,\u201d Michael, who declined a phone interview with TRD, wrote in an email. \u201cBut when I saw him purchase for us a few things that were worth two times or even three times what we paid within a short time, I effectively changed my mind.\u201d\nWhat Michael saw flipped the script on what he viewed as Josh\u2019s core trade competency as a \u201cresidential guy\u201d and instead showed that he had the \u201cMidas touch\u201d on real estate, period. With Michael, at over 80 years old, no longer interested in expanding the portfolio, Josh\u2019s increased responsibility was a natural transition.\n\u201cJosh is more than half my age; I had him when I was 42,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThis is where Josh comes in. It\u2019s Josh\u2019s future and he has clearly proven himself to be very smart when it comes to real estate. When I turned 80, I am not sure if it was a conscious decision or whether I was just ready to turn things over unconsciously, but now Josh is in charge of everything.\u201d\nMichael still has the final yay or nay, but Josh finds the deals, runs the numbers and presents opportunities to his father. Among the family\u2019s newer real estate investments was in New York, 5,500 square feet of\nSoho retail space\nat 170 Mercer Street, which they picked up for an undisclosed amount. He\u2019s now in the process of opening a family office in which Michael also appears to be putting his full trust in his son.\n\u201cI leave it to him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, he gets it from my mother.\u201d\nO\nnly child\nFor Flagg, the work comes across almost as if it\u2019s rote, nothing to get overly excited about nor to brag about, whether looking backward or forward.\n\u201cWhat motivates me?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve just always been driven by work. I love working. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I didn\u2019t work. I\u2019d be bored out of my mind.\u201d\nAt the dining room table of his Trousdale Estates home last year, he fielded questions about his plans. He doesn\u2019t see any one of his businesses eclipsing the others, he said. Being all over the place is just how it goes for him.\nWork colleagues and close friends seem to have a better handle on him. They describe Flagg as an old soul who\u2019s different from his TV persona, which, as he described on episode 1 of season 15, is \u201cegotistical, condescending, somewhat rude and abrasive.\u201d\n\u201cJosh is hilarious and I don\u2019t think on TV \u2014 he does come off as Josh \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that people get truly how funny he is and how smart he is,\u201d Rivers, who considers Flagg a loyal friend, said. He was one of the first to invite her to stay after she lost her home to the Palisades Fire.\nSpelling, the wife of the late TV and film producer Aaron Spelling, chats constantly with Flagg; the two travel together often.\n\u201cPeople love to analyze it,\u201d she said of their friendship. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Why are Candy and Josh so close? You\u2019re from different generations.\u2019 And I tell them, \u2018Because we\u2019re the same species: collectors.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s how the two met: competing against one another at a Christie\u2019s auction in New York.\n\u201cWe talk about things no one bothers with anymore \u2014 China patterns, menu sequences, whether French service is more elegant than English service,\u201d said Spelling, who describes herself as shy and responded to questions via email rather than by phone.\nFlagg was precocious as a child and always friends with adults. His favorite pastime was chatting with grown-ups at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills or at the Brentwood or Hillcrest country clubs \u2014 his parents or grandparents and their acquaintances. He\u2019d play with the art or furniture in his grandmother\u2019s penthouse, or visit with her next-door neighbors, Mattel founders Ruth and Elliot Handler.\nThe obsession with real estate also began when he was young.\n\u201cIf I was six years old and I had a temper tantrum, the only way to calm me down, my mom would put me in her Mercedes convertible and we\u2019d drive around the neighborhood and look at houses and gates,\u201d he said.\nMichael recalled cities built of Legos strewn about Josh\u2019s childhood bedroom floor with model Rolls Royces parked outside buildings. Mischievous, Josh would take the house keys out of guests\u2019 pockets at dinner parties or family gatherings, Michael remembered.\n\u201cAt five years old, he had an affinity for anything that had to do with real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess a key to him meant something even back then.\u201d\nM\naster of all trades?\nSome say the Cheshire Cat from \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d is symbolic of the power that comes from detachment. When one cares nothing about proving oneself with industry awards or rankings, constraints no longer exist in one\u2019s sense of self.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain guys that are very specific \u2014 they just want to golf all day and build stuff, or you\u2019ve got guys that stay in their own lane, whether it\u2019s retail or multifamily or whatever. And Josh is really more opportunistic,\u201d Richard Weintraub, president and CEO of Weintraub Real Estate Group, said. Flagg is harder to pin down, he added.\nWeintraub, a fourth-generation Angeleno like Flagg, is behind some of the region\u2019s most significant retail projects, including the Malibu Lumber Yard and Shops at Sportsmen\u2019s Lodge in Studio City, and the two are eyeing a couple retail development possibilities in Southern California by the beach, according to the developer.\nWeintraub offered his take on the duality of Flagg: \u201cHe can go from having one too many to really locking down the numbers on a deal very easily.\u201d\nAnd Flagg\u2019s Estate Media, the real estate platform with original shows and podcasts, is scaling. It has\n$1 million in seed money\nraised last month from investors such as Compass\u2019 Tracy Tutor and the Hudson Advisory team in New York, in addition to TikTok co-founder Justin Mateen and his brother Tyler Mateen.\nGriff O\u2019Brien, Estate Media co-founder and CEO, said he\u2019s noticed that Flagg flips a switch from funny to serious when it comes to business.\n\u201cHe\u2019s much different than what the camera puts on,\u201d he said.\nStill, with all the talk about Flagg\u2019s serious approach to business, long-term planning (much like emphasizing cash flow) is not his style. Asked where he hopes each of the businesses he\u2019s involved with might be in, say, a decade, he declines to make projections.\nSome might view that as the privilege not to have to worry about success. Others figure it\u2019s part of the secret.\nHe minimizes the contrast.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really how I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about the future. I just think about the present.\u201d",

        "content": "In a housing market defined by what wasn\u2019t available, Chicago\u2019s top real estate agent this year had to chase down business.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to everyone all the time,\u201d said\nEmily Sachs Wong\n, the @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate broker who was the top-producing agent in Cook County in the 12 months ending in October, based on data compiled by The Real Deal. \u201cWhen people tell me they\u2019re thinking of selling, in my mind I\u2019m like, \u2018Who do I have for this?\u2019\u201d\nSachs Wong played the role of matchmaker more than ever this year. She leveraged her connections to seek out properties for her buyers before they hit the market and find buyers for her clients\u2019 listings, she said, navigating low supply in Lincoln Park to close deals.\nChicago\u2019s tight inventory was a consistent challenge for the top performing brokers this year. Homeowners with mortgages below 3 percent aren\u2019t selling, especially in the desirable neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, Bucktown and Lakeview, where many top agents make most of their deals.\nStill, Chicago\u2019s top 20 agents managed to increase their collective sales volume this year compared to last, thanks in part to rising home prices. The top 20 made a combined $3.2 billion in deals this year, which is up more than 14 percent from the $2.8 billion in volume by last year\u2019s top\u00a0 20. That total was spread over 3,338 deals, about 100 fewer than the top 20 brokers made last year.\nThe list counts both buy- and sell-side deals recorded in the Chicago-area multiple listing service from October 2024 to October 2025, excluding any off-market transactions. The ranking includes only Cook County sales and only residential properties over $100,000.\nSachs Wong\u2019s specialty in Lincoln Park \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s most sought-after neighborhoods \u2014 provides a window into dealmaking in the highest level of Chicago\u2019s real estate market, where connections are everything and exclusivity is prized. As listing authorities like the National Association of Realtors and Zillow push for more publicity in listings and transactions, much of the work of Chicago\u2019s top real estate agents is done by word of mouth.\n\u201cI have probably $50 million in sales that I\u2019ve offered that they just couldn\u2019t get so they re-signed their lease.\u201d\nMatt Laricy of Americorp, on deals that didn\u2019t happen\n\u201cKnowing that I have specific requirements for certain clients and trying to find them before they hit the market because when they hit the market, it\u2019s just so much more competitive,\u201d said Sachs Wong.\nSachs Wong and her team at @properties completed $338.3 million in sales in the last year across 174 transactions \u2014 a 72 percent increase from\n$196.6 million in 2024\n, vaulting her from third place to first in this year\u2019s rankings. As one half of what\u2019s likely Chicago\u2019s most powerful couple in residential real estate \u2014 Sachs Wong is married to @properties co-founder and co-CEO Thad Wong \u2014 she tapped into relationships within an influential social network to aid in dealmaking.\nBuyer, meet seller\nThe one-to-one matching Sachs Wong described is allowed under both NAR\u2019s Clear Cooperation Policy and Zillow\u2019s Listing Access Standards. But MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network, a tool used by some luxury sellers to keep their offerings off of public platforms like Zillow, has come under scrutiny, though Zillow hasn\u2019t yet begun to enforce its standards to exclude such listings once they do hit Chicago\u2019s standard MLS.\nNancy Tassone, a luxury broker with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty who made her debut on\nTRD\n\u2019s 2025 rankings at No. 9, said she uses the Private Listing Network often for sellers who want privacy. If Zillow tightens restrictions on how private listings can be marketed, Tassone said luxury brokers would need to adapt.\n\u201cIt is definitely a tool that I use and that a lot of my colleagues who operate in the same price points do for a variety of reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting how all of that plays out and how we have to pivot our strategies to conform, and also decide how important it is being on Zillow.\u201d\nCarrie McCormick\n, the @properties agent who jumped from No. 6 in 2024 to take the second spot this year, said she rarely employs private listings, preferring instead to give sellers full exposure. She sometimes uses the private network when a client wants to \u201cdip their toe\u201d in the market without full publicity.\n\u201cIf they took away the private [network] it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world, but it\u2019s nice to have now because it\u2019s a nice option for sellers to have if they are not fully ready yet,\u201d she said.\nMaking multimillion-dollar deals was tough this year, especially in Sachs Wong\u2019s primary neighborhood of Lincoln Park, where available houses are rare and buyers with deep pockets line up to make offers.\n\u201cThere are so few people leaving their homes,\u201d Sachs Wong said. \u201cLincoln Park has become more popular than ever.\u201d\nSome of Sachs Wong\u2019s biggest sales this year were f\nour penthouse condos\nin the Gold Coast that were owned by billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin \u2014 two of which sold to\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\n. The condos, which she listed alongside Tassone, sold for a combined $34.9 million between November 2024 and April, a steep cut from the $58.75 million Griffin paid for them in 2017.\nLuxury swell\nComing in second behind Sachs Wong, McCormick made $310.9 million in sales on 162 transactions this year, a sharp rise from her $193.7 million in volume in 2024.\nThis year\u2019s top sellers were helped by the strength of\nthe luxury market\n, which blew past previous sales records this year. There were 105 sales of properties worth more than $4 million during the covered time period.\n\u201cThe luxury market has definitely gone up this year. The stock market\u2019s been doing well, a lot of people deployed some of their assets into real estate,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cAnd people are flocking to quality construction, quality properties.\u201d\nThe priciest sale in the rankings was a\n$31.5 million deal\nfor a lakefront estate in Winnetka, which was the most expensive single home resale in Chicagoland history until late November, when the record broke again. @properties agent Jena Radnay represented both the buyer and the seller on the deal. She also represented both sides in the\nnew record\ndeal, an off-market sale also in Winnetka, for $32.5 million. Radnay landed in sixth place in the rankings, with $213 million in sales across 41 transactions.\n\u201cIt was obviously a career high moment,\u201d Radnay said of the sale. \u201cThis property is an iconic lakefront property that can never be duplicated.\u201d\nInventory shortage\u00a0takes toll\nMatt Laricy of Americorp came in third, sliding from first place in\nTRD\n\u2019s 2024 rankings. The Laricy Team had a transaction volume of $273.1 million, a slight bump from the $269.5 million in volume the team did in 2024. Laricy\u2019s team was hit with tragedy early this year when his founding partner, Catherine Holbrook,\ndied at 40 shortly after giving birth\n.\nIn fourth place was Grigory Pekarsky, managing broker at Vesta Preferred Realty, followed by Jeff Lowe of the Lowe Group at Compass.\nAll of them said the inventory shortage was a challenge this year. Lowe, who dropped from second place in 2024 to fifth place this year, said his sales were hurt by low inventory and a drop in new condo buildings coming online. Lowe tallied $240.9 million in volume, compared to $247.6 million in the 2024 ranking.\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many homes,\u201d Lowe said of Northwest Side neighborhoods. \u201cAnd when people don\u2019t sell, you get bidding wars left and right. So there\u2019s four to six buyers for every property you put on the market right now.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a plus for the broker who has the listing, but it means buyers have a harder time making a deal, and it pushes costs up, pricing out some buyers. Laricy said he had dozens of buyers this year who couldn\u2019t land a deal on the right house and decided to re-up their rental leases, dropping out of the market for another year.\n\u201cI have probably $50 million in sales that I\u2019ve offered that they just couldn\u2019t get so they re-signed their lease,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cThe biggest thing that hurt me is just, there wasn\u2019t enough inventory to meet the client demand.\u201d\nPekarsky\u2019s team at Vesta Preferred Realty increased its sales from $193.7 million in 2024 to $260.1 million this year. Pekarsky said his growth was helped by pushing his agents on outreach and contacting clients, and more carefully tracking their interactions.\n\u201cIf you contact 10 people the right way, one of them will eventually fall into your lap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been doing that on a much grander scale and learning how to do a bigger and bigger flow of communication.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "They say if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. For Compass, the adage could be, if you can\u2019t beat them, buy them.\nThe New York-based national brokerage came in second place in The Real Deal\u2019s 2025 rankings of top Chicago brokerages with $5.47 billion in sales in Cook County. But it still got to enjoy the fruits of the $7.85 billion in sales made by the top-ranked brokerage, Chicago\u2019s\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n, which Compass acquired at the beginning of this year.\nAnd if Compass\u2019 bid to buy its\nnext biggest national competito\nr, Anywhere Real Estate, is approved by regulators, it would have ties to four of the top five performing brokerage firms in Cook County this year, either through direct ownership or through a franchise. Those four firms \u2014 @properties, Compass, Coldwell Banker Realty and Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 made about $18 billion in sales volume over the last year, 63 percent of the total volume traded by the top 20 brokerages.\nCompass Regional Vice President Fran Broude said industry-wide consolidation was accelerated by last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors settlement that changed how brokers charge commissions.\n\u201cConsolidation is not a new thing here. I\u2019ve been around a long time, and I\u2019ve been through consolidation and disruption before,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of normal for the business.\u201d\nEven so, the phenomenon in Chicago\u2019s market this year was on a new scale. Compass\u2019 acquisition of @properties was finalized in January, while Baird &amp; Warner\nannounced its merger\nwith tech-focused Dream Town in June. And in September, Compass\nannounced its plans to acquire Anywhere\n, the national firm that owns big brands like Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Century 21.\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re competitive as an only child, you\u2019re wildly more competitive when you have a sibling.\u201d\nThad Wong, co-founder and co-CEO of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nThe moves made for a seismic shift in the real estate fabric in Chicago, one that the industry rarely sees all at once, said Jim Miller, the president and managing broker at Jameson Sotheby\u2019s.\n\u201cAll of those would have been monster stories that would have been spread out over a decade and we got them in a matter of 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as an industry are having to learn to pivot, not overreact when changes happen.\u201d\nThe top 20 brokerages in 2025 tallied a combined $28.6 billion in sales volume this year across 49,947 transactions. That is down from the $29.3 billion in volume and 57,137 transactions traded by the top 20 brokerages in\nTRD\u2019s 2024 rankings\n. The list counts both buy- and sell-side deals recorded in the Chicago-area multiple listing service from October 2024 to October 2025, excluding any off-market transactions. The ranking includes only Cook County sales and only residential properties over $100,000.\nFinding an identity\nIn the increasingly amalgamated landscape of Chicago real estate, each brokerage is facing pressure to better define its brand and prove its value to consumers and agents.\nFor Thad Wong, co-founder and co-CEO of @properties, the merger with Compass has driven him to be more competitive with the parent company. He said the merger is forcing his firm to hone its value proposition and justify itself as a separate brand from Compass. It increased its volume by about $450 million this year, while Compass lost about $117 million in sales compared to last year.\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re competitive as an only child, you\u2019re wildly more competitive when you have a sibling,\u201d Wong said. \u201cSo I think the cool part about it locally is that (@properties) being No. 1 and Compass being No. 2, we can compete very heavily with one another, and each side is going to get better.\u201d\nBroude said the acquisition went smoothly and Compass was intentional about allowing @properties to keep its brand and leadership.\n\u201cEvery intention is to keep two separate brands. There are different things about the companies,\u201d Broude said. \u201cThey both have very rich cultures, different but very rich cultures.\u201d\nBoth Wong and Broude said\n@properties is likely to adopt Compass\u2019 technology suite at some point in the future, but their platforms are currently still separate.\nAyoub Rabah, regional president of the corporate-owned Coldwell Banker Realty, said in the short term, its potential merger wasn\u2019t changing much for the brokerage. Coldwell kept its third place spot in this year\u2019s rankings, making $2.76 billion in sales over 6,257 transactions.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely excited about the announcement and the merger, but what I\u2019m really focused on is serving the end consumer who\u2019s just trying to get into a home today,\u201d he said. He especially tries to find homeownership opportunities and address affordability for the lower end of the market, where many feel priced out of homes.\nSome executives at brokerages that are franchised under Anywhere\u2019s brands but owned independently said the merger could bring them the best of both worlds \u2014 the tech and network that Compass offers and their independent, local feel.\nColdwell Banker Real Estate Group, a family-owned brokerage that\u2019s one of the Midwest\u2019s largest, made TRD\u2019s rankings at No. 20 this year based on Cook County sales, completing $249.8 million in transaction volume across 517 sales. Should Coldwell Banker come under Compass\u2019 ownership, it could bring capital and better technology to the franchise, president and CEO Mike Prodehl said.\n\u201cWe have a tech stack now, it\u2019s just fairly antiquated,\u201d he said.\nIndependents\u00a0carve out lane\nAs national brokerage companies pursue consolidation, Chicago\u2019s independent firms view an opportunity to differentiate themselves and promise a local touch for agents and clients.\nBaird &amp; Warner, which ranked fourth in this year\u2019s list with $2.43 billion in sales across 4,702 transactions, has gone all in on its homegrown roots, at times jabbing Compass in public communications.\nLaura Ellis, chief strategy officer, executive vice president of residential sales at Baird &amp; Warner, said consumers will want to \u201cshop local\u201d with Baird &amp; Warner rather than the \u201cbig box stores\u201d of Compass and its affiliates.\n\u201cThe real estate industry for a long time was sort of looked at as a sea of sameness by agents and consumers,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening recently is illustrating that that\u2019s not the case. That the cultures are very different.\u201d\nTo further stake its claim as Chicago\u2019s local powerhouse, the Dream Town merger nearly doubled Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s presence in the city of Chicago.\nDream Town, which is ranked separately from Baird &amp; Warner in TRD\u2019s rankings, came in at No. 8 with $907 million in volume across 1,644 transactions. Combined, the two brokerages tallied $3.34 billion in volume over the last year.\nAnother local firm adapting to the shifting market is Fulton Grace Realty. The independent brokerage was ranked 11th in TRD\u2019s list, keeping the same rank as in 2024 and completing $512.8 million in transaction volume.\nFulton Grace acquired Main Street Real Estate Group, which had about 50 agents, in August. TJ Rubin, Fulton Grace\u2019s president and founder, said he expects smaller independent brokerages to continue to join forces to compete with the bigger companies.\n\u201cThere is a strong value proposition in independent brokerages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can offer big firm resources, with still the family feel.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Imagine two apartment complexes in Chicago: one that will cost $380,000 per unit to build and another where expenses are $790,000 per unit. The second might conjure up images of luxury amenities and waterfront living.\nBut in reality, the $380,000-per-unit tower is the ritzier of the two. The market-rate high rise, currently being built by Vista Properties, is in the city\u2019s trendy\nFulton Market neighborhood\n, just west of the Loop. It will have a rooftop pool, a golf simulator and a 24-hour doorman, among other luxury amenities.\nThe $790,000-per-unit building is an affordable housing development in progress on the Far North Side of the city where tenants can expect to spend up to an hour on public transit getting to and from the Loop and return home to amenities that aren\u2019t luxurious.\nHuge gaps between affordable and market-rate development costs aren\u2019t exclusive to Chicago. A slate of recent studies and news reports indicate that in many U.S. cities, building affordable has become pricey, with some developments in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco passing the $1 million-per-unit threshold.\nThis is a conundrum in a country purportedly dedicated to solving a housing crisis for residents whose incomes aren\u2019t keeping up with living costs.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $800,000 or $900,000 on one unit, that\u2019s a unit that doesn\u2019t get built,\u201d Chicago-based developer David Doig said.\nWant to build more housing, particularly affordable? Then, \u201cwe should be laser focused on how we can get the most amount of units with the least amount of cost,\u201d he said.\nThe hefty price tags aren\u2019t a revelation for those in the know. But as Americans increasingly push for more housing options, the contradiction \u2014 that affordable development is expensive to create \u2014 has trickled out to the mainstream. Debates over how we got here and what to do about it have been gaining traction on social media and making headlines in the\nWashington Post\n, the Wall Street Journal and regional publications.\nWhat drives up spending? Affordable housing developers have to pay for the usual line items: debt, materials and labor, all of which have been going up across the country.\nBut they also spend to comply with extra layers of bureaucratic red tape from whichever government agencies are subsidizing their project. And, they may shell out for amenities that the private market might not support, like four-bedroom units for families or on-site daycare facilities, meaning that price-per-square foot comparisons may not be apt.\n\u201cA lot of times, the news headline is just the per-unit cost without taking into account any apples-to-apples comparison about the deals \u2026 It can drive me crazy,\u201d San Diego-based affordable housing developer Jimmy Silverwood said.\nStill, there may be hope for making the development of affordable units more affordable. A slew of public policy changes and solutions from the private market are showing that housing can be built for less, even while making deals more appealing to investors.\nT\nhe blame game\nThe costs of debt, construction materials and labor are putting a strain on developers of all kinds. But when it comes to determining what factors drive up the costs of affordable housing specifically, there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around, developers say.\nA majority of affordable housing developments in the U.S. are funded by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, system, which awards either 4 or 9 percent tax credits to affordable housing developers. Those developers then sell the credits to institutional investors or banks in exchange for the capital needed to get their project going.\nWhile the system helps developers secure funding to complete a project and offer discounted rent, it also means developers have to wind through a labyrinth of regulations to win the tax credit allocation in the first place.\nDevelopers also typically apply for additional funding from city or county housing agencies that may attach their own set of requirements \u2014 and expenses.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code. But they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nAndy Schcolnik, president of Chicago\u2019s South Side Builders Association\nTake a recent $66 million project proposed by affordable housing developer National CORE.\nThe projected cost to build the 81-unit apartment complex in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills comes out to about $800,000 per unit. A typical market-rate building in L. A. County costs about half as much to build, a recent study from the Rand Institute found.\nIn its LIHTC application, CORE noted that it set aside $2.1 million for local impact fees (which apply to projects of all types), $1.8 million for architectural and engineering costs, $777,000 for permit processing, $285,000 for energy and prevailing wage consultants, $145,000 for legal and other consulting costs and $70,000 for an environmental audit for a total of about $6 million in costs that could be impacted by changes to affordable housing regulations.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hire a consultant to design and implement. You\u2019ve got to hire a sustainability consultant, you\u2019ve got to have a compliance consultant, and you\u2019ve got to have an architect that\u2019s LEED certified,\u201d Doig said.\nDozens of design standards required by the Los Angeles County Development Authority dictate details from the number of washers and dryers in a building to the thickness of its floorboards. The goal is to prevent developers from cutting corners only to justify the lower rents, not require them to get fancy.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know a lot about the industry, you might think that somebody\u2019s selling a $900 toilet seat,\u201d Wayne Beals, a Chicago Realtor who specializes in sustainable developments, said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\nSometimes, regulations bake in goals that do not have a direct bearing on the finished apartments. Political objectives can include prevailing wage requirements, which push up labor costs in exchange for well-paying, union-backed jobs. Environmental regulations might mean developers have to include drought-resistant landscaping or energy-efficient appliances.\nThe environmental standards can, however, reduce operational costs in the long run, Beals noted.\n\u201cWe need to be building buildings that are resilient, that have a vision for a low-energy, cheap-energy future,\u201d he said.\nAnd then there are the soft costs, which tend to escalate more significantly for affordable developers. Paperwork-related costs and fees on service providers like architects, engineers, consultants and lawyers came out to about $187 per square foot for LIHTC developments compared to $84 per square foot for market-rate developments in California, according to the Rand Institute.\nPlus, there is often more community pushback on affordable projects which can drag timelines out and rack up costs.\nWhile the price gap isn\u2019t exclusive to the coasts or big cities, it does vary somewhat. In Texas, for example, the delta between market rate and affordable housing soft costs is smaller. The typical LIHTC development carries $60 per square foot in soft costs while a market rate development has about $22.\nSome states are taking action.\nIn Colorado, where state legislators have passed a series of builder-friendly policies, affordable housing developers actually carry about $50 less per square foot in total costs than market-rate developers.\nC\nutting red tape\nA recent streak of YIMBY-style policies has taken effect across the U.S., as municipalities try to make it easier to build.\nSome of the ideas are immediately controversial. Allowing the use of non-union construction for affordable housing in Chicago, for example, could be a political landmine.\nOthers have not yet proven their value, like streamlining permitting processes or clearing up other administrative hurdles that add time \u2014 and money \u2014 to a project.\nNew York City\u2019s \u201cCity of Yes\u201d initiative sheds parking minimums and legalizes\naccessory dwelling units\nin most neighborhoods. Passage by the City Council was a victory, but it\u2019s still early days in the real world.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order integrating the processes for approving both residential and commercial building projects. The program, known as the \u201cCut the Tape\u201d campaign, targeted 14 different departments.\nAnd in California, some housing projects have been exempted from prevailing wage requirements and certain aspects of\nenvironmental review\n.\nWhile reforms can be helpful and drive construction costs down, they don\u2019t always address the specific delta between market-rate and affordable housing development costs.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code,\u201d Chicago\u2019s South Side Builders Association President Andy Schcolnik said. \u201cBut they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nPoliticians hear a different question: how many corners are they willing to cut to get more housing built as quickly as possible?\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve labor, we\u2019re trying to solve social inequality, we\u2019re trying to solve workforce development and we\u2019re trying to solve all this stuff with low-income housing, when really we should be trying to solve housing,\u201d Beals said, picking up a common metaphor for this approach: the everything bagel.\n\u201cI am with them on this bagel problem,\u201d he said, suggesting that housing could be exempted from having to meet such a handful of social goals. \u201cHowever, just because an everything bagel is horrible and tastes bad doesn\u2019t mean we have to have a plain bagel.\u201d\nF\ninancing fixes\nThe law of supply and demand holds in the world of affordable housing. Because of stagnant wage growth and high inflation, more Americans want affordable places to live, driving demand, while the expense of building tamps down supply.\nSome real estate players and investors are taking notice of this dynamic.\nOne is Safehold, which is creating a ground lease structure for affordable housing developers that allows them to reduce upfront development costs.\nSimilarly, the Shidler Group has begun shifting away from its business in office ground leases in favor of multifamily. In 2022 alone, the firm acquired the land under 13 multifamily properties with more than 3,900 units, which could lower starting costs.\n\u201cThese folks are seeing this as an annuity, especially for the long-term ground leases. They\u2019re saying, you know, the risk is little to none, right? This development has 1,000 people on the waiting list,\u201d Silverwood, the San Diego developer, said.\nAnother policy effort seeks to cut borrowing costs.\nAt the federal level, the nation\u2019s largest funding source for affordable housing, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, will increase from a 9 percent subsidy to a 12 percent subsidy in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the city of Chicago established a $135 million revolving loan fund that essentially allows the city to issue low-interest loans to affordable housing developers. Interest collected on the loans goes back into the fund.\n\u201c[LIHTC] certainly comes with a lot of requirements that are imposed by the federal government in terms of how you implement the affordability portion of it and so that drives up the cost per unit,\u201d Chicago\u2019s Deputy Mayor of Economic Development Kenya Meritt said. \u201cBut when you think about our other models \u2026 those costs per unit are more in alignment with what you\u2019ll see in the private market.\u201d\nA series of units subsidized by Chicago\u2019s new \u201cMissing Middle\u201d funding program which gives grants to developers in specific neighborhoods were recently approved. They range from townhouses to six-flats, totaling 108 units across 30 buildings and are collectively valued at $39.4 million. The total cost per unit? About $365,000.",

        "content": "Shareholders searching for confirmation that Opendoor is in its new era \u2014 not-so-subtly dubbed Opendoor 2.0 \u2014 might have found it in the company\u2019s third quarter earnings.\nGone were monotone deliveries from CFO-turned-CEO Carrie Wheeler detailing the company\u2019s efforts to cut costs and improve margins. Instead, the new CEO,\nKaz Nejatian\n, in a black T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cFaster,\u201d spoke directly to the camera in a livestreamed presentation titled \u201cEarnings and Chill.\u201d\nNejatian, who came over from e-commerce giant Shopify where he most recently served as chief operating officer, was installed in the top spot a little less than three months ago in a populist, retail investor-driven uprising during which Opendoor\u2019s share price rose by more than 10X at one point.\nNejatian did not respond to multiple direct messages on X, to which Opendoor\u2019s press email now directs inquiries, stating that the company does not work with PR agencies \u201cas we prefer to speak for ourselves.\u201d\nBut Nejatian has been on a whirlwind tour of tech-guy podcasts, appearing on TBPN and a16z in the last few months to relate his rapid ascension.\nAs Nejatian tells it, he became \u201ca little bit obsessed with Opendoor\u201d in February, going so far as to text one of the company\u2019s co-founders, Keith Rabois, that he wanted to take the company private \u201cbecause it needs to be run better.\u201d Ultimately, Nejatian did not buy the company and instead was nominated as the new CEO by a board that now includes Rabois and former Opendoor CEO and co-founder Eric Wu, giving him his opportunity to cure what he believes ails the company. Changes so far include mandatory return-to-office, a slew of hiring changes and an AI-above-all-else mentality.\nBut while Nejatian has brought the hallmarks of the \u201cmove fast, break things\u201d ethos to a company he thinks has lost its way, it remains to be seen if he can solve the biggest problems in a business model \u2014 buying and selling homes online \u2014 that has never shown a clear path towards profitability.\nThe company traded over 27,000 homes last year, down from its peak of over 74,000 homes bought and sold in 2022.\nA\nreturn to software\nNejatian inherited a company that was managing its decline, hoping that an eventual turnaround in the housing market could spark its own aboutface. By 2025, Opendoor had fallen a long way from the\nhalcyon pre-IPO days\nof 2020.\nOpendoor had raised billions in debt and equity on the idea that it could simplify the complex world of homebuying and selling in a field called iBuying, where it stocks a marketplace with homes it has actually purchased. For sellers, the value proposition was clear: Opendoor would buy your fixer-upper without the hassle of marketing, staging and dealing with physical buyers and their emotional questions about a place they plan to live. For buyers, Opendoor was building a marketplace of homes to search and purchase near-instantly (Opendoor introduced, and later scrapped, a \u201cBuy It Now\u201d button).\nAnd for Opendoor and its investors, the company would make money on the spreads between purchase and sale price.\n\u201cThe core concept of iBuying is awesome, like it really, truly is for some homeowners that want to sell with a click of a button,\u201d industry analyst Mike DelPrete said. \u201cThe problem is nobody\u2019s yet been able to provide that awesome customer proposition and a sustainable business model.\u201d\nInterest rates skipped in 2022, leaving Opendoor holding thousands of homes it couldn\u2019t sell as the housing market cratered. Wu, who had served as CEO since 2014, stepped down at the end of 2023, and the company pulled back its buying activity drastically under Wheeler, who brought a money manager\u2019s\nmindset\nto a company that had previously been trying to hit the jackpot.\n\u201cThe core concept of iBuying is awesome, like it really, truly is for some homeowners that want to sell with a click of a button.\u201d\nMike DelPrete, industry analyst\nThe company\u2019s stock price plummeted in the following years to below $1 \u2014 in danger of\ndelisting\n\u2014 as Wheeler tried to stem the bleeding. A reversal of fortunes did not come from any shift in the business, however. Activist investor\nEric Jackson\nposted in July that his firm had taken a position in Opendoor, and retail investors jumped in. The stock tripled in one week to $2.25. It now is trading above $6, although fluctuates mightily on a daily basis.\nIts market capitalization of more than $6 billion now dwarfs its more stable competitors, including Compass, the country\u2019s largest residential brokerage.\nFrom that point on, the company \u2014 and its stock \u2014 seemed to respond more to Jackson\u2019s tweets than anything else. When he posted on Aug. 6 that he was \u201creally offended\u201d about Wheeler seeming to dismiss the retail surge, dozens of commenters chimed in and called for a new CEO. A week later,\nWheeler was out\n.\nNejatian has echoed Jackson and online commenters, claiming the company lost its way when it started focusing too much on pushing numbers around a spreadsheet.\n\u201cOur job is not to run a fucking hedge fund that aims to own assets and make money off of macroeconomics,\u201d Nejatian told the San Francisco Standard. \u201cOur job is to buy and sell lots and lots of homes at very tight spreads and make money off of transaction volume.\u201d\nNejatian follows in a long line of swearing, slouchily dressed modern tech executives who seem to believe that nobody can be a true disrupter in a starched white button down.\n\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s idea of a corporate executive,\u201d Nejatian, sporting yet another black T-shirt, said on the TBPN podcast. \u201cI cuss a lot, I grew up as a nerd, I didn\u2019t do all that well in my finance undergrad courses.\u201d\n\u201cThis is how I dress,\u201d he added.\nIn Nejatian\u2019s view, businesses are not built with Excel spreadsheets, do-nothing decks or wasteful meetings (at Shopify, Nejatian installed a meeting cost estimator that displayed how much the company spent on each meeting).\n\u201cWhen you go to business school, they\u2019re like, \u2018You shall have a business plan and it should be 17 pages and it should have like Porter\u2019s Five Forces on it and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work,\u2019\u201d he said on a podcast. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just like generally not how great businesses are built.\u201d\nNejatian, who moved to Canada at 12, has also followed the modern tech world\u2019s increasingly rightward shift. Nejatian\u2019s wife Candice Malcolm founded conservative news site True North (rebranded as Juno News), to which Nejatian and Malcolm have also contributed millions. The site came under fire for posting an interview last year with Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right terrorist organization the Proud Boys. At Shopify, he shuttered several initiatives meant to support Black and Indigenous clients and\ncame under heat\nfrom employees over his involvement with True North and political donations.\nTo some from Nejatian\u2019s past, the changes coming to Opendoor look less like a revolution and more like the same old tricks.\n\u201cLiterally cop[y]ing what he\u2019s seen work at Shopify,\u201d one user wrote in a thread on a private forum of current and former Shopify employees shared with The Real Deal. \u201cEventually the playbook drys[sic] up and he\u2019ll be out of ideas to copy.\u201d\n\u201cHe pushed NFT real hard,\u201d another wrote. \u201cUsing AI for everything is not vision; it\u2019s wishful thinking.\u201d\n\u201cOmg he\u2019s going to be CEO???\u201d another wrote on a thread about news of his move. \u201cRIP to Opendoor.\u201d\nLike other politically conservative bosses, he is likely now leading a group of employees that skew liberal, one former Opendoor employee pointed out.\nN\new model\nSo far, Nejatian has focused publicly on getting the company back to its tech roots and shipping products faster. In October, Opendoor launched a warranty feature for homebuyers, which allows them to return a home if they don\u2019t like it within seven days.\n\u201cWe are ditching manager mode,\u201d Nejatian said on the company earnings calls. \u201cWe\u2019re now firmly in founder mode. We are refounding this company. This is Opendoor 2.0.\u201d\nAnd the company has significantly ramped up its contract activity, according to a new dashboard on its website showing weekly purchases. In the first two weeks of November, Opendoor had contracts to buy an average of 282 homes per week, more than double its weekly rate over the summer.\nIn many ways, Nejatian appears to be trying to Elon Musk-ify the company, all the way down to his gaudy incentive-laden compensation package, layoffs and the relentless updates on X about progress. Nejatian is getting paid $1 in annual salary but\nstands to make\nup to $2.8 billion in equity incentives.\n\u201cOur job is not to run a fucking hedge fund that aims to own assets and make money off of macroeconomics.\u201d\nKaz Nejatian\nIn September, Nejatian shared a memo sent to Opendoor employees that required employees to \u201cdefault to AI\u201d in their job. \u201cWe need to move faster \u2014 always. And we can\u2019t do that without being AI obsessed,\u201d he\nwrote\n. \u201cSo, starting today the first line in everyone\u2019s job expectation is simply this: Default to AI\u201d\nAfter the company\u2019s\nthird-quarter earnings\ncall, Nejatian posted that he was buying an additional $1M in stock.\nThe frenzied activity and posting has been the kind of thing that has kept the \u201c$OPEN Army,\u201d the nickname for the company\u2019s rabid retail investors, charging the front lines.\nWhen TRD reached out in a popular Discord server for Opendoor investors, one of the few responses was: \u201copendoor to the moon is all you need.\u201d\nNejatian gave investors \u2014 both retail and institutional \u2014 a hard deadline for profitability: the end of next year. The company bought down over $200 million in convertible notes to clean up its balance sheet and issued tradable warrants with strike prices starting at $9 to cozy up to retail investors still riding the wave.\nAt the same time, Nejatian has been emphatic in his belief that Opendoor can be a \u201cgenerational business,\u201d the Amazon of home sales. It just needs the inventory, then the buyers will flood in to buy and sell homes, but also get their mortgages, insurance and who knows what else.\nIndustry insiders think we\u2019ve seen this show before.\u00a0Zillow and Redfin also got into iBuying, and Zillow ultimately lost more $1 billion in less than four years before shuttering its program in 2021.\n\u201cWe did this experiment,\u201d Jack Miller, president and CEO of T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm, said. \u201cWe discovered there\u2019s a certain amount of appetite in the market for a high-convenience sale, and now it\u2019s just making that business be really performant and efficient and scaled correctly for the amount of demand.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, is it a niche thing, or is it going to become a mainstream phenomenon that significantly changes how people sell houses and then buy houses in the future?\u201d Brian Boero, CEO of consulting firm 1000watt, added.\nOne of Nejatian\u2019s ideas is the tokenization of real estate transactions.\n\u201cAsset tokenization is not a side quest for us,\u201d he said on the earnings call. \u201cTokenization allows us to increase the speed of transactions, decrease the cost of transactions, and broaden the base of homeownership.\u201d\nThat belief goes back to a core principle of Opendoor, that real estate can be commoditized, stripped away of money-grubbing agents and mortgage brokers and as easy as ordering sesame chicken on your phone.\n\u201cIn the future, buying a home will be as seamless as buying a car from Tesla,\u201d Nejatian said. \u201cYou\u2019ll choose your home, your financing, your warranty, your insurance, all in one place, all in one flow. Right now, homeowners have to deal with a bunch of different companies, brokers, agents, a lot of different stuff to get what they need for a house. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nBut DelPrete, who tracked Opendoor 1.0\u2019s downfall, said disrupting a complex and outdated industry like real estate isn\u2019t that simple.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, we\u2019re going to use software and AI to streamline the process and bring costs down, but you can\u2019t use software and AI to replace the fact that there\u2019s an actual home involved, with a basement and flooring and curtains and carpet and staging and real estate agents,\u201d DelPrete said.\nTo a certain degree, Nejatian, who openly grimaces at Corporatespeak, has relied on the buzzwords of a different part of the business world, replacing \u201csynergy\u201d and \u201cheadwinds\u201d with \u201cAI\u201d and \u201ctokenization.\u201d\nIf he can find a way to turn those words into tangible changes to one of the largest industries in the world, he could in fact have a generational business on his hands. If not, he\u2019ll hear it in the retail investor forums.",

        "content": "Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s rise mirrors the story of the city he played a leading role in shaping: Both were plopped into the middle of the North Texas prairie without much by way of resources. They figured out how to harness the wave of growth, resist its undertow and get really, really big.\nMoayedi was 15 when he left Tehran for a small suburb of Fort Worth in 1976. He made the move ahead of his mother and stepfather, an Air Force pilot who worked at Bell Helicopter, transferring from a small Seventh Day Adventist academy in Iran to a high school with 2,500 students that could have inspired a \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d set.\nHe still remembers his first day at L.D. Bell High School: he showed up to what must\u2019ve been a sea of denim bellbottoms in a dress shirt and tie. He was scared.\nIt didn\u2019t last long. Moayedi ditched the tie but kept his Persian last name. He made a ton of friends, played sports, converted to Christianity and, over the course of 50 years, became arguably the most prolific single-family lot developer in North Texas.\nDespite being many miles from a coastline or useful riverway, Dallas-Forth Worth has\ngrown like a weed\nduring Moayedi\u2019s time here. Between 1970 and 2025, its population more than tripled from 2.4 million to 8.6 million. Satellite imagery timelapse shows the region unfolding in all directions with notable visible changes at the end of each year.\nThroughout his career, his Farmers Branch-based firm\nCenturion American Development Group\nhas developed more than 200,000 lots spanning about 75,000 acres. This year, the firm\npurchased 1,100 acres\nfor a project in Grayson County, 630 acres for a community in north Fort Worth and 550 acres as part of the Preston Harbor development on Lake Texoma.\nIf you combined all Moayedi\u2019s communities into one, the expanse would almost cover the city of Philadelphia. But they\u2019re not contiguous. Instead, the wall-sized map in the company\u2019s conference room shows Centurion American dots in every growth corridor of the ever-expanding region.\nWhile single-family lot development and master-planned communities make up the majority of his business today, he\u2019s also dabbled in condo development, historic preservation and adaptive reuse.\nThe tale of his rise has a cast of big real estate players. D.R. Horton co-founder Terry Horton took him to church on Sundays. Herman Smith, the Fort Worth developer who was president of the National Association of Homebuilders, gave him landscaping jobs.\nMoayedi is known for his affability, but you don\u2019t get to where he\u2019s sitting without picking up some rivals. His foes are heavy-hitters, too, like Kyle Bass, the hedge fund manager featured in Michael Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who has spent years trying to uncover what he believes are fraudulent dealings between Centurion American and a former lender, United Development Fund IV.\nMoayedi has faced his share of legal scrutiny, some ongoing, but he\u2019s so far emerged unscathed, allowing him to earn a place among the icons who mentored him.\n\u201cThere will never be another one of him,\u201d said Trevor Kollinger, Centurion American\u2019s vice president of finance and development and the closest Moayedi has to an appointed successor.\nMoayedi wouldn\u2019t be able to typify \u201cthe developer\u201d in a place that valorizes the red-blooded, denim-clad cowboy without getting the buy-in of the OGs. He respects their roots.\nTake Sean Terry, the tobacco-spitting former mayor of\nCelina\nwho handles land entitlements for Centurion American and is his family\u2019s sixth generation in Collin County.\n\u201cI do have respect for him in a different way, because his parents settled here. They did all the hard work to make this what it is. I do owe them something, and for that reason, I\u2019m very mindful of it,\u201d Moayedi said.\nStill, Terry insists, his immigrant boss is \u201cmore American than I am.\u201d\nA\ngravitational personality\n\u201cThe best motivation is poverty,\u201d Moayedi said, so when the Iranian Revolution of 1978 wiped out his family\u2019s financial stability, he dropped out of college at the University of Texas at Arlington and got to work.\nHe started a landscaping company, drawing on his experience doing lawns in high school. No one was paying attention to the greenery at spec houses at the time, so Moayedi proposed a deal: He\u2019d do the yard, and the builder could pay him when the house sold.\nThat\u2019s how he got connected with builders like Herman Smith and Don and Terry Horton, the men who would become his mentors. Ask him how chance meetings became lifelong relationships, and he makes it sound simple, \u201cHe took a liking to me.\u201d\nDavid Craig, his longtime friend and collaborator on the upcoming Preston Harbor development on Lake Texoma, highlights another factor in the equation: his ability to deliver.\n\u201cBelieve me, you can\u2019t accomplish that just by being friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to perform and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nMoayedi landed his first real development opportunity in the late \u201980s. John Dees, the father of his friend Michael Dees, had this swath of land in Grapevine called Windsor Forest. Wanting to retire, the elder Dees gave Moayedi a shot at developing it. When he completed it, he was short $600,000. How was he going to quickly pay the debt? Another deal, of course.\n\u201cYou may be working for technically nothing for five, six, seven, eight years, until you get to the final phase. That\u2019s when the profits maybe start come rolling in, and you feel like maybe it was worthwhile for the first several years or so.\u201d\nRex Glendenning\nHe drove around the Metroplex, scouting. He discovered a 60-acre development site, cold-called the owner and was faced with a new challenge: a 15-day deadline to come up with $6 million to buy the land. One friend agreed to lend him the money, but when it wasn\u2019t enough for the full cost of development, another friend \u2014 Herman Smith, the builder \u2014 connected Moayedi with another developer, who agreed to do the work and accept payment when Moayedi sold the lots.\n\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t have any money. Somebody gave me money from land. The other guy gave me the development money. I got it done. I did a good job with it. I sold everything. I paid the $600 [thousand] back. Now I had about half a million dollars cash and was off to the races,\u201d Moayedi said.\nMoayedi took business detours into infrastructure, manufacturing and utility work before settling his focus on development. He always comes back to the land, which, in his hands, becomes Centurion American\u2019s signature master-planned communities. The transformation is satisfying to him.\n\u201cAfter I\u2019m gone, my kids can drive by and say, \u2018My dad built that,\u2019\u201d he said.\nMoayedi\u2019s legacy depends on his affability. His friends relay his unfailing generosity. Even a former partner who named him in a lawsuit couldn\u2019t muster up anything bad to say about him, though whether that\u2019s just good Texan manners is hard to say.\n\u201cEverything has translated back to relationships,\u201d Kollinger said. \u201cHe has that gravitational personality that you feel right off the bat.\u201d His Christmas party brings all his friends together. He used to hold the party in Downtown Dallas; since his 2022 purchase of Southfork Ranch in Parker, he now throws the bash there, in a mansion made famous by the show \u201cDallas.\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t operate like someone who knows he\u2019s charming. He squirms in front of a camera and says what he means. He\u2019s also got the emotional acuity of a man whose closest family members are women. He tears up talking about his mother, Behjat McElroy, who died in 2024, calling her \u201cthe smartest person I knew\u201d and praises the skills of his sister Mahtab Moayedi, a developer based in California. He gushes about his two daughters, Lily and Sarah, both in college in California.\nOnce, he was swimming with friends in Grapevine Lake and came across a man who was living in his car with a baby. Moayedi invited them to stay at his house. The guy ended up working for Moayedi as a mason and eventually took over his masonry business.\nWhy would a guy in his twenties trying to make it in real estate offer up a room to a stranger? \u201cIt just seemed like the right thing to do at the time,\u201d he said.\nC\nenturion American\nLike any good Texan, Moayedi credits his success to the grace of God. As Moayedi tells it, God opened up deals for him and guided him through each challenge.\nInvocations of the divine undersell how good he is at making deals.\n\u201cMehrdad\u2019s the consummate deal junkie,\u201d said \u201cKing of Dirt\u201d Rex Glendenning. The longtime friends have worked together for decades, most notably on the $4.5 billion Legacy Hills development in Celina.\nMoayedi founded Centurion American Development Group in 1990. Today, the company has 155 employees. Master-planned communities form the bulk of the firm\u2019s business.\nThe development process typically starts with Glendenning identifying a piece of raw land that he thinks would make a good site. If Moayedi agrees, the next step is to get the land entitled, which involves working with the local zoning commission and city council.\nMoayedi was the first developer to use a financing model called a Public Improvement District (PID) after the state legislature authorized it in 2007, and he often creates this or similar public-private partnerships to offset the costs of infrastructure development. This whole process might take six months, Glendenning said. Then it\u2019s time to bid out the infrastructure and build roads, add utilities and plan amenities centers.\nMoayedi runs the bids against what builders will pay for lots to determine what\u2019s profitable. That\u2019s when homebuilder friends like D.R. Horton come into the picture \u2014 they purchase lots and then build and sell homes.\nOn a 1,000-acre deal, it can take 15 years to build a master-planned community. The profit doesn\u2019t come until the end.\n\u201cYou may be working for technically nothing for five, six, seven, eight years, until you get to the final phase,\u201d Glendenning said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the profits maybe start come rolling in, and you feel like maybe it was worthwhile for the first several years or so.\u201d\nThese communities are Centurion American\u2019s bread and butter, but he\u2019s tried other ventures.\nHe made a splash more than a decade ago when he purchased the iconic Statler Hotel and Residences in downtown Dallas, drawn to the history of the landmark. The Statler had introduced consumers to amenities like elevator music and televisions in each room when it opened in 1956, registering Coco Chanel and Ike and Tina Turner as guests.\nAfter closing in 2001, water damage and vandalism meant the hotel\u2019s only visitors were of the rodent variety. Moayedi was the latest in a series of developers who tried to bring the gem back to life over the course of about a decade. With the help of nearly $50 million in incentives from the City of Dallas, he completed the $230 million project in 2017, turning the dilapidated structure into a 159-key hotel with 219 luxury multifamily units, revamped event space, restaurants and retail.\n\u201cThat job has been probably one of the hardest jobs that I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve hung in there, because it\u2019s important to me for the city of Dallas,\u201d he said.\nHe also bought the Residences at the Stoneleigh out of bankruptcy and finished out the condo tower. At the old Dallas Public Library, he converted the space into offices.\nThe firm\u2019s largest projects are ahead. Centurion American is four years into the redevelopment of Collin Creek Mall, which Moayedi is transforming into a mixed-use development with more than 3,000 housing units, 1.3 million square feet of office space and 300,000 square feet of retail. He also has the $7 billion Lake Texoma project with Craig.\nHis process for picking what he works on outside of master-planned community development comes from instinct, some combination of emotion and logic.\n\u201cI kind of go by the seat of my pants,\u201d Moayedi said.\nIt\u2019s the same looseness for his own home purchases, and he buys and sells residences frequently. His office has a pool going on how long he\u2019ll stay at the house he moved into less than a year ago in Highland Park. The wagers are in months.\n\u201cI get bored of things,\u201d he said.\nA\nsystem that works for him\nMoayedi and DFW wouldn\u2019t have had a prayer of such large-scale impact without the state\u2019s signature pro-business ethos.\nThat, combined with the boost he\u2019s gotten from mentors and his natural inclination to help others, have made Moayedi into something of a gentleman\u2019s capitalist. The system, as he sees it, works properly when people are free to make money and give it back.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this country does. You look at most of the people in this country that are billionaires, 95 percent give it back in a good way,\u201d he said.\nHe donates to causes related to war veterans with particular passion and has teamed up with community leaders like state Sen. Royce West to connect kids with professional mentors.\nThe worldview involves respect for local history. He\u2019s aware that longtime North Texans could perceive him as an outsider swooping in and capitalizing off the hard work of people who\u2019ve invested in their communities here for centuries.\n\u201cSome people could think, \u2018Hey, who is this guy to benefit off our fathers and grandfathers?\u2019 I\u2019m very humble about it, and also I know that I\u2019ve been given a right. I\u2019ve been given a blessing, so I need to be right about it.\u201d\nAll this makes him a Republican. But his geniality means his circle is wide; some of the \u201cgreat men\u201d in his life are Democrats, he said, and he gets along with them, too.\nMoayedi, who purchased a jet from President Donald Trump in 2024, keeps evidence of his Trump support all over his office, including a half-dozen framed photographs with the president. The glittery lion\u2019s-head sculpture on Moayedi\u2019s desk wears a MAGA hat. (Not a diehard, he also displays a photo of himself with Mike Pence and a copy of Nikki Haley\u2019s book.)\nHe plays an active role in preserving the state\u2019s pro-developer conditions he credits for his success, donating handsomely to Republicans at every level of politics and even a few Democrats.\nMoayedi\u2019s political activity invited scrutiny over the summer when it became clear that he donated $25,000 to Tarrant County Commissioner Manny Ramirez and $10,000 to Tarrant County Judge Tim O\u2019Hare in 2023 before seeking approval for a public improvement district in the county.\nIt doesn\u2019t take an ethicist to question the optics. But this is Texas, a state where the legislator who spearheaded state property tax reform owns a company that helps people lower their tax bills, and the veil between business and politics can be thin.\nO\nn Bass\u2019 bad side\nThe last 10 years have been Moayedi\u2019s most successful but also some of his more private. He hasn\u2019t really done the rounds in the press since completing the Statler in 2017.\nThe period of increased privacy coincided with a bruising public legal battle that drew Moayedi into the fray but hasn\u2019t knocked him over.\nMoayedi may not have many enemies, but the people who have issues with him are pretty persistent. One of them is Kyle Bass. In 2015, Bass started shorting stocks of United Development Fund IV, one of Centurion American\u2019s lenders, based on allegations that the fund was a Ponzi scheme. Bass claimed UDF was using new investor money to pay existing investors in faltering earlier funds. He also argued UDF\u2019s biggest borrower, Centurion American, was complicit. Bass also thought the two parties got too cozy, pointing to the fact that Moayedi once owned a jet with now-imprisoned former UDF CEO Hollis Greenlaw.\nBass called the Federal Bureau of Investigation with his evidence and presented his case anonymously on the website Harvest Exchange. His argument got picked up and made the rounds online, resulting in plummeting UDF shares, an FBI raid of UDF\u2019s corporate offices and ultimately, a $30 million windfall to Bass.\nLater, a federal jury convicted four UDF executives on 10 counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and securities fraud. They were sentenced to a combined 20 years in prison.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and FBI investigated the claims, and Moayedi was never charged with anything. Still, Bass was unsatisfied with the SEC\u2019s findings and bought stakes in multiple Centurion American projects in an effort to do his own digging into the company.\nHe declined an interview for this story, writing in an email, \u201cI\u2019ve decided when I don\u2019t have anything positive to say about someone \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nThe ordeal spurred additional legal challenges, including from Zack and Aaron Ipour, the founders of DFW homebuilder Megatel Homes. Megatel sued Moayedi in 2020, claiming UDF participated in a scheme to prop up Moayedi\u2019s companies and defraud Megatel. The matter is still ongoing and will likely go to trial.\nThe Ipour brothers also sued to block the redevelopment of Collin Creek Mall, claiming they had the right of first refusal to buy the property. A jury ruled in favor of Moayedi, finding that Megatel had given up its priority.\nMoayedi is also fighting a suit from Dallas-based REIT and UDF shareholder NexPoint on similar grounds to the wrapped-up FBI and SEC investigations. NexPoint claims Moayedi participated in an \u201celaborate scheme of fake transactions\u201d in which UDF would make a loan to a new Centurion American project, whose proceeds Moayedi would use to make a payment due on a loan he\u2019d taken out from UDF for an earlier project. Jeff Tillotson, the attorney for both clients, also represents Kyle Bass. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for Mr. Moayedi, but the clients who\u2019ve come to me have had interests averse to him,\u201d Tillotson said to The Real Deal.\nIn a Nov. 18 filing, a Texas Supreme Court judge determined Texas doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the matter and directed the court to dismiss the case.\nMoayedi wasn\u2019t afraid to jump into the fray to defend against the accusations, even issuing a statement at the time calling the Megatel suit \u201ca sign of a desperate man grasping for a lifeline.\u201d Today, he handles questions about the period with characteristic geniality.\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those guys, I\u2019ll take my punches, sit in front of people and do what I\u2019ve gotta do. We were okay. God looked at it. The authorities looked at it,\u201d he said.\nHe lets out a pained yelp and a dark chuckle when he recalls the legal bills involved in the court brawl. But his business quadrupled in the time period when the legal battle stretched on, he said.\nW\nhat\u2019s next\nMoayedi doesn\u2019t dwell much on the past though. When he isn\u2019t working, he cheers on FC Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys and the Mavericks, or travels to California to visit his daughters. He\u2019s rebuilding the Malibu home he bought in 2020 that was destroyed by the Palisades Fire in January. He recently took the longest vacation of his career, a 15-day trip to the south of France.\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to ruminate about the future either.\nIf and when the founder steps back, Kollinger \u2014 the implied successor \u2014 imagines a board of directors could make decisions about the kind of one-off projects Moayedi pursued by gut or instinct. Kollinger himself would be comfortable leading the land development business, he said. It shows no sign of slowing, as master-planned community developments veer\ncloser and closer to\nOklahoma.\nThe best perspective on Moayedi\u2019s impact comes as you make your final descent into the world\u2019s third-busiest airport. From that vantage, the sea of rooftops arranges itself along suburban streets like dominoes, against a background of pavement and emerald backyards.\nNot everyone adores the look of suburban sprawl. Moayedi shrugs off complaints about the aesthetics. He\u2019s the land guy, not the architect.\n\u201cPrice dictates what you can actually build,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people sitting on the sidelines, being critical of things, but it\u2019s very important to have a roof over your head, good schools, a place you can go hang out, parks and all that.\u201d",

        "content": "What can real estate learn from Rochester? More than you might think.\nAbout what not to do, that is.\nUpstate cities such as Rochester, Syracuse and Utica declined as industry retrenched or moved to the South or overseas. New York City\u2019s large manufacturing base was also gutted, with employment in that sector plunging from 1 million jobs to about 55,000.\nYet New York City\u2019s economy grew while its upstate counterparts withered away.\nWhy haven\u2019t upstate cities been able to reinvent themselves as New York City did?\nX user @PhilSustainable got me thinking that poor land-use policy is a big part of upstate cities\u2019 problems.\nSpecifically, huge swaths of upstate cities are devoted to parking. These innumerable masses of macadam spread people apart and sap life from what should be urban centers.\n\u201cSyracuse has a world-class collection of parking spots. Sadly, they\u2019re mostly empty space,\u201d PhilSustainable\ntweeted\n. \u201cImagine if that sea of asphalt was a sea of tall multifamily homes with corner stores and retail. Syracuse can put its land back to work and be rich.\u201d\nHe punctuated his point with four photos:\nThen he turned his attention 90 miles west.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy seeing parking lots in Downtown Rochester. The city should be as rich as Brooklyn today, but chose pavement instead.\u201d\nThe photos are just brutal:\nFor all the New York Post headlines about people fleeing New York City, its population has remained relatively high. Between the Great Financial Crisis and the pandemic, it surged by more than 700,000 people to just above 8.8 million. It\u2019s upstate\u2019s losses that have reduced the state\u2019s number of House districts from\n45\nin the 1940s to 26 today.\nI don\u2019t want to give our city policymakers too much credit. The street grid and transit system were here long before they were. And the city has only recently begun to\nget rid of parking mandates\n; it has only avoided having lots of surface lots because land was too expensive to create them.\nAnd although high demand to live in the city pushed our population count up, it would have risen by even more \u2014 and rents by less \u2014 if elected officials hadn\u2019t preserved parking mandates and low-density zoning across 70 percent of the city.\nBut at least the city didn\u2019t do what upstate cities did, embracing the notion that the local economy depends on people being able to park for free within 50 feet of their destination.\nThe photos above show what all that empty space produces: a whole lot of nothing.\n",

        "content": "Carlos Saavedra was hoping for a repeat.\nStanding on the roof of a converted multifamily property on Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights, Saavedra points to a brick building on Sidney Place with a nearly-abutting back lot.\u00a0He\u2019s planning to do something similar there to the Clinton Street property he converted into a single-family townhouse and hopes to sell for an unnamed \u2014 but sure to be astronomical \u2014 price.\nSaavedra, a co-head of developer Eckstrom\n, says he thinks Brooklyn Heights could use more condos. But the single-family opportunity proved too hard to resist.\nHe\u2019s not the only developer who has started to see piles of cash in the shape of stately townhouses when a vacant lot or multifamily property hits the market. Brooklyn Heights is an epicenter of the phenomenon, where\ndevelopers like Saavedra\nhave sought to use the momentum from big-ticket deals for renovated homes to build their own tricked-out single-family offerings.\nDevelopers in the area are following a flow of affluent New Yorkers to Brooklyn and a surprisingly resilient luxury market across the city that have spurred relentless price growth in the borough\u2019s in-demand neighborhoods.\nIn Brownstone Brooklyn, which includes luxury-heavy neighborhoods like Cobble Hill and Park Slope, the average price per square foot was up 16 percent in the third quarter from the same time last year to reach $2,231. That mark set an all-time record, which is something that has happened more often than not each quarter for the last two years,\naccording to appraiser Miller Samuel\n.\nBut the seemingly uncapped upside for single-families might be finally hitting its imported-Danish-wood ceiling, with some projects seeking record-setting prices now starting to linger on the market.\nAnd developers like Saavedra have been eying newcomers warily, concerned that their carefully manicured reputations will suffer from imitators trying to make a quick buck.\n\u201cIt almost seems like we make it look easy, but it really is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cJust one developer not doing a good product \u2014 it\u2019s really bad for all of us.\u201d\nWhen the price and timing are right\nBrownstone Brooklyn\u2019s cramped streets have attracted attention before the current spate of developers trying their hands at single-family homes.\nThe Kushner Companies secured a six-property portfolio in\nBrooklyn Heights for $36.5 million in 2014\n, turning three of the buildings that had served as multi-family homes into rentals.\nBut the Kushners may have overestimated the upside in the area at the time. One of the homes on 100 Pierrepont Street, which the company bought for roughly $6 million, gut renovated and listed for $10 million in 2017 \u2014 only to sell the 5,900-square-foot house for $6.4 million four years later after a series of price cuts.\nBut developers who have flocked to the area in recent years say price points have risen to the point where newly-built townhouses can pencil out.\nJon Schippers, whose firm, Steering House, takes on projects in various iterations of developer, architect, builder or all three, said he \u201cjust couldn\u2019t find very good deals\u201d around Brooklyn Heights, even when he was looking for \u201cportfolio pieces.\u201d But now, $15 to $20 million sellouts are feasible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too aggressive and say it\u2019s a sure thing, but you can easily comp that,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that, it makes it a lot easier to pull the trigger on certain asking prices.\u201d\nSchippers\u2019 firm worked as the builder on the Brooklyn Home Company\u2019s renovation at 1 Sidney Place,\nwhich sold for $22.1 million last year\n, the second-most expensive sale in Brooklyn.\n\u201cIt used to be that clients were coming to our active work area looking for good value, and now most of the time, that client cares very little about money and wants the best,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re designing developments, we\u2019re thinking a lot less about the budget and a lot more about designing and building something really unique and one of a kind.\u201d\nThe appetite in the luxury segment, where all-cash buyers remain undeterred by high mortgage rates, has far outpaced everything else. In the first nine months of this year, luxury sales in Brooklyn rose by over 23 percent from 2024, compared to just a 2 percent increase in the rest of the market.\nAt 170 Clinton, which Saavedra bought for $4.75 million in 2023, Eckstrom had initially scoped out doing five floor-through condos in the building, which used to be a 10-unit multifamily. But he dropped the plan to two units after seeing that buyers of the larger units were going to be less affected by rates.\nThe switch to a single-family came by chance, after a subcontractor knocked down a back wall by mistake. Rather than wait for approval from the attorney general\u2019s office on an offering plan \u2014 contingent on approval from the Landmarks Preservation Committee \u2014 Saavedra tried marketing the whole building as a single-family and put the home into contract over one year ago with a\nlast asking price of $14 million\n.\nA boom in progress\nSchippers is currently in the midst of building a 4,700-square-foot passive house at 33 Joralemon Street and looking to find a buyer willing to pay a hefty price point for the opportunity to have a say in most of the finishes. He also has another pre-construction project on Pierrepont Street.\nHis projects are a few in a rising wave that has dotted the neighborhood with scaffolding. In 2024, the Department of Buildings fielded 118 job applications for Brooklyn Heights and surrounding areas that involved converting a lot into a single-family home, up from just 42 applications in 2019.\n\u201cI have investors calling me all the time, looking for buildings in the neighborhood,\u201d said James Lee Wall, a broker with specialty townhouse firm Leslie Garfield. \u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing buildings that they think can make a big turnaround.\u201d\nBut asking prices and closed deals are two different things.\nDeveloper Vladem Brodsky listed two of his projects, at 295 and 299 Hicks Street, for $26 million and $18 million. The offering at 295 Hicks Street, which he bought for just over $4 million in 2021, sat on the market for six months before it was rented, while the asking price for the home at 299 Hicks Street dropped from $18 million last year to $15 million this year. (Brodsky did not respond to multiple requests for comment).\nThe homes lingering on the market speak to the idiosyncratic nature of single-family development, where homes need to feel one-of-a-kind but not \u201cstick out like a sore thumb,\u201d according to Schippers.\nAnd while Brooklyn Heights seems to be an incubator for eight-figure homes, not all blocks in the neighborhood are created equal, which makes a difference when developers are trying to seek top-of-market prices.\n\u201cSometimes the mistake developers make is that they\u2019ll try to get the same A+ prices on a B- location,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Noah Plener.\nJust a couple hundred feet can change the calculation, according to Saavedra. Such could have been the case at 307 Hicks Street, which sits two blocks north of the main thoroughfare Atlantic Avenue, and went into contract asking $15.5 million at the end of last year.\n\u201cIf this house was the next block over, a little bit closer to Atlantic, we would have definitely not done one-family,\u201d he said of 307 Hicks.\nWall also questioned the $18.5 million asking price at 175 Clinton Street. The underway project is located next to the Key Foods on Atlantic Avenue, a potential noise pollution concern and value killer. \u201cThat\u2019s aspirational, but this is what developers are seeing in the neighborhood,\u201d he said.\nBrooklyn Heights still has more room to grow with a host of projects expected to be seeking big numbers. But the neighborhood could also serve as a blueprint for projects and developers in other corners of the borough where prices are rising, but the luxury townhouse market is still in its nascent stages.\nBrodsky this summer\nset a neighborhood price record\nin Fort Greene, where he purchased a townhouse at 39 South Portland Avenue for $4.7 million with plans to create condos before a buyer offered $8.8 million in all-cash for the unfinished home.\nAt the corner of Berry and Second streets in Williamsburg, Lior Barak and Christine Blackburn snagged a deal in July for a 5,500-square-foot home they developed on an empty lot asking $10 million. The contract was the\nmost expensive deal for a residence\nin the neighborhood by nearly 20 percent.\nIn Greenpoint, a landmarked townhome was initially converted into two condo units but\nsold to a single buyer as a two-family for $6.9 million\nin July, shattering the neighborhood\u2019s price record.",

Newmark\u2019s Gabe Munson represented the buyer.\nIt is a \u201cstandout asset\u201d due to \u201cits strong fundamentals \u2014 favorable transaction size, prime location and strategic positioning,\u201d Benton said in a\nstatement\n.\nThe property drew more than 40 offers because its location in Pasadena means it is not subject to the City of\u00a0 Los Angeles\u2019 Measure ULA real estate transfer tax, Shannon said.\nThe voter-approved \u201cmansion tax,\u201d which went into effect on April 1, 2023, imposes a 4 percent fee on all property sales above $5 million and a 5.5 percent fee on sales above $10 million with in the L.A. city limits.\nHines reportedly has a \u201cvalue-add plan\u201d for the 23-year-old Pasadena complex, Benton said, including an overhaul intended to add resort-style offerings at the 1.6 acre-propert..\nPasadena Gateway Villas \u2014 set in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains \u2014 includes studio to three-bedroom units marketed to the city\u2019s higher-end renter base.\nApartments come with gas fireplaces, in-unit washers and dryers, private balconies or patios and vaulted ceilings.

        "content": "Texas\ncommercial real estate distress\nis closing out the year with a bang as lenders appear eager to offload troubled properties before 2026.\nFor months, the value of Texas CRE loans flagged for each monthly foreclosure sale has hovered around $600 million. In December, it shot up to more than $900 million, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nOf the $911 million in loans scheduled for auction, $659 million is tied to multifamily properties. Plus, multiple loans flagged earlier this year but were never sold appear headed back to auction block, like\nCharles Cohen\u2019s design center\nat 5120 Woodway Drive, which was originally headed to auction in June and July.\nHarris County, home to Houston, is reliably the hardest hit and was again this month, with 11 loans topping $250 million, but, this month, the rest of the Texas Triangle isn\u2019t far behind.\nNearly $180 million worth of loans faces foreclosure in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located. Travis County, home to Austin, is inching closer, too, with $168 million worth of loans allegedly in default.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nFannie Mae has already filed a\nlawsuit against Jon Venetos\n\u2019 troubled firm Lurin Capital, claiming he defaulted on the $77.2 million loan tied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive. While many floundering multifamily investors can blame the distress on unpredictable floating-rate loans, Venetos can\u2019t; the Fannie Mae loan had a fixed rate of 5.1 percent.\nThe lender is poised to try to seize control of the property at this month\u2019s foreclosure auction. The debt works out to $105,177 per unit for the property built in 1976.\nAustin\nAri Rastegar could lose four Austin apartment complexes at the December sale in Austin. The properties are tied to a $22.7 million loan from Greystone. The loan is backed by Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street. The debt works out to $139,263 per unit.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender,\u201d a dispute he plans to continue litigating even if he loses the properties. He added that the properties are such a small percentage of his portfolio.\nSan Antonio\nLynd Living\u2019s Copper Mill Apartments is scheduled to be auctioned off this month. The 344-unit apartment complex at 5827 Northwest Loop 410 was built in 1980. Lynd allegedly defaulted on a $34.3 million loan, part of a collateralized loan obligation issued by Franklin BSP Realty Trust. The debt works out to $99,709 per unit.\nDallas\nThis biggest new loan flagged for foreclosure in Dallas County is the $24.2 million mortgage tied to Tesoro at 12 Apartments, a 184-unit apartment complex 4271 Altoona Drive. Arbor provided the loan for the property built in 1984. The borrower is an entity tied to a group of investors, including Ce Shi, Matthew Picheny and Stephen Lee-Thomas. The loan works out to $131,521 per unit.\nFort Worth\nAnother property is on the chopping block for\nbeleaguered syndicator Tides Equities\n. The firm, which has been shedding properties via forced sales for multiple years now, could lose one more before the end of the year. Tides allegedly defaulted on a $32.8 million loan, part of a collateralized loan obligation issued by Franklin BSP Realty Trust. The loan is backed by Tides at Westcreek, a 272-unit apartment complex at 6776 Westcreek Drive in Fort Worth. The debt works out to $120,588 per unit for the property built in 1984.\nTides partnered with Pecos Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Tides sold the property to Pecos Housing Finance Corporation, an affordable housing organization more than 300 miles from Fort Worth, and leased the ground. Gov. Greg Abbott\nsigned a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors.\nDenton\nFrisco-based Jordan Multifamily\ncould lose five student housing communities\ntied to a $55.5 million loan from Argentic Real Estate Finance. The portfolio includes: a 79-unit complex at 911 Bernard Street; an 80-unit complex at 707 Bernard Street; an 81-unit complex at 1607 West Live Oak Street; an 82-unit complex at 1003 Eagle Drive; and an 83-unit complex at 2424 West Oak Street. The portfolio comprises 405 units; the loan works out to $137,037 per unit. Jordan purchased the properties in 2022. They were built between 1962 and 1975.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, 13 have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been to the block before:\nLangdon at Walnut Park, a 277-unit complex at 2101 North Lamar in Austin ($60 million);\nOne Technology Center, a 196,000-square-foot office building, at 7411 John Smith Avenue in San Antonio and Three Forest Drive, a 367,000-square-foot office building, at 12221 Merit Street in Dallas ($57.75 million);\nArioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes, a 288-unit complex at 3030 Claremont Drive in Fort Worth ($56 million).\nMia Riverside, a 312-unit complex at1601 Royal Crest Drive\u00a0 in Austin ($50.2 million); and\nDecorative Center of Houston, a 500,000-square-foot design center at 5120 Woodway Drive ($50 million).\nAviator at Brooks, a 280-unit complex at 8010 Aeromedical Road in San Antonio ($33.9 million);\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 in Austin ($16 million).\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio($10.5 million).\nThe Ascent Apartments, a 154-unit complex at 1150 Babcock Road in San Antonio ($7.5 million);\nLegacy Apartment Homes, a 130-unit complex at 11300 Roszell Street in San Antonio ($6.9 million); and\nA 4.5-acre development site at 3461 McLarry Drive in McKinney ($5.8 million)\nThe Flats at 9338, a 88-unit complex at 9338 Perrin Beitel Road in San Antonio ($4.6 million).\n",

        "content": "The last couple of years have been rough on developer Brian Tuttle.\nIn December 2023, faced with a maturity date on three loans totaling $38.4 million secured by a Royal Palm Beach development site, Tuttle was on the hunt for new lenders to refinance the debt, and new equity partners that could provide capital to break ground on his 38-acre mixed-use project, Mainstreet at Tuttle.\nBut\nTuttle\ngot an icy reception from banks and potential investors. \u201cBanks were saying that due to interest rates, the appraisals had to be reduced significantly,\u201d Tuttle told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cAnd with the appraisals being reduced significantly, you had to put more equity into the deals.\u201d\nWhen he spoke with potential investors, \u201cthey were all looking for a steal,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cSo when everyone is looking for a below-market deal, the fair market deals just get overlooked. It was very frustrating.\u201d\nIn July 2024, the lender, Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group, filed its foreclosure complaint against two Tuttle entities that own the\nRoyal Palm Beach site\n. In an email to his contractors the same month, Tuttle said he had met with more than 200 groups in a 14-month span to put equity into the project, and had no luck. In September, the\nTuttle entities\nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to stave off a foreclosure auction after Fuse Group won a $47.4 million judgment during the summer.\nTuttle is not alone. A dozen other developers are going through a similar predicament. Across the tri-county region, 13 development sites have landed in bankruptcy court or are in the crosshairs of foreclosure with industry players warning that this is the front edge of a bigger wave. In 2024, five development sites faced foreclosure, according to an analysis by\nTRD.\nSouth Florida\u2019s pandemic boom was supposed to inoculate the region from the commercial real estate reckoning gripping the rest of the country. Instead, rising interest rates, high construction and land costs, and more skittish equity investors are turning stalled projects into distress cases. And a growing list of local developers are experiencing a brutal hangover, faced with a reckoning with lenders that are done \u201cextending and pretending.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s more in the pipeline,\u201d Josh Rubens, a shareholder with Miami law firm Kluger Kaplan, told\nTRD\n. \u201cI think there have been some extensions over the last 12 to 24 months that you will be seeing headlines about in the next six to 12 months, as those maturities hit.\u201d\nLoans due after pandemic boom\nDuring the Covid migration surge, developers raced to lock up sites and launch apartment towers, condo-hotels, offices and mixed-use projects on the assumption that rents and prices would keep climbing, and that floating-rate debt could be refinanced before it reset higher.\nThat script blew up when the Federal Reserve hiked rates, and construction costs jumped by roughly 30 percent in a matter of a few years, according to lenders. Plans that looked like slam dunks in 2021 and 2022 now show thin or negative returns once higher borrowing costs and pricier hard costs are baked in. That makes it far tougher to secure new construction loans or new bridge loans.\n\u201cFlorida, and South Florida for sure, still has demand,\u201d said Brett Forman, whose Fort Lauderdale-based Forman Capital has financed ground-up projects across the state. \u201cBut you had explosive growth brought on by Covid\u2026 and there are developers that may have gotten over their skis, perhaps [got] too aggressive.\u201d\nHe points to a \u201cginormous amount of debt\u201d still coming due through this year and 2026, much of it on land or early stage deals that never made it to full construction financing.\nThe common denominator in many of the distressed sites are short-term bridge loans \u2014 typically 12 to 36 months, sometimes with six-month or 12\u2011month extension options \u2014 that have already run through multiple reprieves. Those loans were supposed to carry a project through entitlements or early predevelopment to a cheaper construction loan or a sale. Instead, developers are stuck in place while interest accrues at double-digit rates.\n\u201cYou rerun the math at a higher interest rate and building costs up 30 percent, and the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore,\u201d Holly MacDonald\u2011Korth of Coral Gables-based KDM Financial, told\nTRD\n. \u201c[Developers] have a hard time getting a new loan for a deal that, on paper, doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to turn the profit they thought.\u201d\nThat dynamic is playing out at a slew of Miami and Fort Lauderdale development sites.\nForman Capital\nis seeking to foreclose on a planned condo-hotel site in Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District over an alleged default on an $8.3 million bridge loan that matured in August. The lender says it is owed default interest and fees on top of the unpaid principal.\nThe project\u2019s former manager, prolific high-rise developer Dan Kodsi, said he is no longer involved, underscoring how quickly capital stacks can get reshuffled when a bridge lender\u2019s clock runs out. Forman and Joseph Pardo, the attorney for the entity that owns the site, declined to comment about the foreclosure case.\nPrivate lenders putting the squeeze\nMost of the developers for the 13 sites with distressed loans are dealing with private lenders that have run out of patience. In several recent cases, foreclosure suits have escalated into bitter legal battles, with developers filing last-ditch bankruptcy petitions or appeals.\nIn Aventura,\nRok Lending\nended up taking title to a 1.6\u2011acre medical office development site at a foreclosure auction, paying just $477,800 after winning a $19.9 million foreclosure judgment tied to a $15 million loan it issued in 2023. Developer Marlon Gomez repeatedly tried to stall the sale with appeals and bankruptcy filings, all of which were denied. The strategy bought him time, but not a better outcome.\nAnd on the Miami River, a receiver is trying to sell a 1.8\u2011acre site for a project called\nMiami River Cove\nfor $18 million. The planned 40\u2011townhome development, also tied to Gomez, is the subject of a foreclosure suit by a Fiorentino Family Office affiliate that alleges a default on a $10 million loan and claims the borrowing entity used fraudulent documents to secure the debt. Gomez and his partners deny wrongdoing. Gomez did not respond to requests for comment.\nBankruptcy petitions and countersuits against lenders are largely stonewalling tactics by borrowers holding out hope that market conditions for refinancing and capital equity will improve, Forman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of quasi delaying the inevitable,\u201d he said.\nLenders are now pushing back on those tactics. For instance,\nFuse Group\n, the lender in the Mainstreet at Tuttle site in Royal Palm Beach, had asked the bankruptcy court to toss the developer\u2019s Chapter 11 petition, alleging that Tuttle long planned to use Chapter 11 solely to delay the foreclosure process. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 20 to Jan. 22, court records show. Rubens, the lender-side attorney, also represents Fuse Group. He declined to comment about the case.\nMeanwhile, the Tuttle entities have submitted a reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court. \u201cWe filed a Chapter 11 to protect the unsecured creditors so that [Fuse Group] didn\u2019t wipe them out,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019re working with the bank and the bankruptcy court to come up with the best plan to try and make it a win as much as possible.\u201d\nEven marquee developments that symbolized Miami\u2019s pandemic-era swagger are starting to fray. At Miami Worldcenter, Monarch Alternative Capital is moving to foreclose on the site of Kodsi\u2019s\nLegacy Hotel &amp; Residences\n, a 50\u2011story condo-hotel where construction has been paused since last year. Monarch now controls a roughly $340 million loan originally made by Silverstein Capital Partners in late 2021, that, according to Kodsi, was only partially funded, court filings show.\nKodsi told a judge this summer that he is working on a roughly $390 million refinancing, but he missed a court ordered deadline to post a\n$32 million\nsurety bond, and faced a November cutoff to pay more than $35 million in principal, unpaid interest and late fees. The case encapsulates the new math: Even highly marketed, partially built towers with strong locations and branding are struggling to refinance large, floating-rate construction loans in today\u2019s environment.\nMore pain in the pipeline\nLender-side attorney Rubens said the biggest problem loans often involve default interest running at 20\u2011plus percent for extended periods. To refinance, borrowers may need fresh equity to bridge the gap between what the new lender will advance and what is owed on the defaulted loan.\n\u201cThere may be a large balance that another lender is apprehensive about getting involved in,\u201d Rubens said. \u201cThese things just take time, and unfortunately, time sometimes really works against the developers when you have a high interest bridge loan that\u2019s ticking away with interest.\u201d\nMacDonald\u2011Korth said that with at least 13 sites already in default, more are inevitable, especially where lenders got \u201ca little aggressive\u201d on proceeds and valuations during the boom.\n\u201cEverybody thought South Florida is exempt from all of these commercial real estate issues,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turns out, a year or two later, it\u2019s not.\u201d",

        "content": "The\nvelvet-roped corner of University Park\njust added another chart-topping listing.\nA nearly 13,000-square-foot estate in the coveted Volk Estates enclave is back on the market at $35 million, instantly landing among the priciest homes publicly listed in Dallas. The property at 6601 Hunters Glen Road debuted Oct. 31 and is now tied for the region\u2019s second-most expensive public listing with a Highland Park manse on Lexington Avenue, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The asking price is equivalent to $2,701 per square foot.\nOnly the\nCrespi Estate\n\u2014 the perennial heavyweight at $64 million \u2014 sits higher. The listing marks a dramatic jump in asking price from its last sale in 2021, when a trust linked to the late private equity executive Joshua Pack bought the home for $21.5 million.\nPack\n, co-CEO of Fortress Investment Group, died in September at age 51.\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\u2019 Alex Perry has the listing. Modern updates are credited to the Dallas-based Sebastian Construction Group.\nThe estate spans almost two acres, a rarity even within Volk Estates, long considered one of the area\u2019s most exclusive pockets. Built in 1927, the three-story home blends its original architecture with a suite of recent updates. Inside are five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half-baths, plus refreshed living spaces and redesigned suites meant to modernize the nearly century-old footprint without losing its bones.\nOutside, the grounds read like a private club: layered gardens and courtyards, a resurfaced and retiled pool, full tennis court, putting green and reworked patios all in view of a two-story cabana. The private gym has undergone a complete overhaul as well, rounding out the compound-style amenities expected at this echelon of the market.\nDallas Central Appraisal District public records show annual property taxes topping $252,000. The manse is a marker of where luxury valuations continue to push in the Park Cities, even as\nhigher-end listings take longer to trade\nin the broader market.\nVolk Estates homes rarely surface, and when they do, they tend to reset the local pricing curve. With the Pack estate now asking $35 million, the enclave remains a bellwether for\nultra-luxury demand\nin Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Access Industries\u2019 Len Blavatnik\nhas plenty of commercial irons in the fire, but was behind a quiet residential deal that has set the Hamptons luxury market ablaze.\nThe Ukrainian-born billionaire was the buyer of 408 Further Lane, Behind the Hedges\nfirst reported\n. The deal closed in late July, but property records showed the buyer identified as a limited liability company named Brise Lontaine.\nBlavatnik paid $115 million \u2014 $13.5 million per acre \u2014for the eight-and-a-half-acre property, marking the largest deal for a single residential parcel in Hamptons history.\nCombined parcels have sold for a higher price tag, but in terms of a single parcel in the Hamptons, none had surpassed a $105 million deal in Water Mill in 2021. The sale also represented the first nine-figure deal in the Hamptons in almost two years.\nThe billionaire is not new to the area, already owning a smaller home on Further Lane and an oceanfront estate on Dune Road in Bridgehampton.\nThe seller was Terry Semel, the one-time chair of both Yahoo! and Warner Bros. Semel bought the property from Blackstone\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman in 2005 for $43 million. Neighbors on Further Lane include Jerry Seinfeld, Lorne Michaels and Larry Gagosian.\nIn the two decades of Semel\u2019s ownership, the five-bedroom cottage that was the prize of the parcel was converted into a guesthouse, while a modern main house draws the bulk of the attention today; its square footage is unknown and pictures of the residence are difficult to come by.\nThe average sales price in the Hamptons in the third quarter was $3.5 million, according to\nMiller Samuel\n, while the median sale was an even $2 million. Both of those numbers represented the second-highest marks on record, per the report.\nElsewhere, Blavatnik is working with fellow billionaire Vlad Doronin of the OKO Group on\nsecuring approval\nfor changes to the Aman Miami Beach luxury condo and hotel development under construction. The oceanfront project will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in an 18-story building, as well as the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "New York City is poised to get three casinos.\nThe state Gaming Facility Location Board on Monday recommended that the Gaming Commission award casino licenses to the three remaining proposals in Queens and the Bronx.\nThe proposals include Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, an $8 billion facility planned near Citi Field; the proposed $4 billion complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s $7.5 billion expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe board assessed the proposals based on four different\ncategories\n, giving the most weight to \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d which included various factors, including total planned investment, jobs potentially created and each team\u2019s ability to finance the project.\nThe proposals now go to the commission, which is expected to issue the licenses by the end of December.\nThe commission will not second-guess the assessment of the board, but will make sure the casino proposals meet\nstatutory requirements\n, many of which were part of the board\u2019s review, a spokesperson for the commission told\nTRD\nin October.\nThe three winners were the only remaining competitors in the years-long race for one of three state licenses up for grabs.\nThe board\u2019s announcement comes after Community Advisory Committees eliminated four teams from the competition, including\nevery\nManhattan proposal. In a surprise move last month, MGM Resorts\ndropped\nits bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-blown casino. At the time, the company blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d pointing to the fact that the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nMGM also wanted an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state in October, the company\u2019s Yonkers proposals would only qualify for 15 years.\nUnder the rules, in order to qualify for 30 years, an applicant would need to invest at least $10 billion. Resorts World pegs its investment at $7.5 billion, and Cohen estimates $8 billion for Metropolitan Park, which would mean a 20-year license for each. The projected investment at Bally\u2019s is $4 billion, which means it qualifies for a 15-year license.\nPlans for Metropolitan Park would turn 50 acres worth of parking lots next to Citi Field into a casino complex with a Hard Rock hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue, restaurants and 25 acres of green space. As part of their casino bid, Cohen and Hark Rock International have also\nteamed up\nwith Slate Property Group to build 450 affordable housing units at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, roughly two miles from the planned casino.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino would be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice green area at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project would include 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nThe planned expansion of the Queens Aqueduct would add gaming space (6,000 slot machines and 800 table games), as well as 2,000 hotel rooms and a 7,000-seat arena. Resorts World has also agreed, through an agreement with\nCirrus Real Estate\n, to invest in 50,000 workforce housing units citywide.\nIn the lead-up to Monday\u2019s announcement, Gaming Commission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer has emphasized that the state could issue up to three licenses and could opt to award fewer. During a September meeting, he called the competition a \u201ctabula rasa.\u201d\nStill, Resorts World, and MGM before it dropped out, appeared to have a leg up in the contest, given that they were already operating as slot parlors.\n",

The total was down from 29 contracts signed in the\nprevious period\n, but it beat the decade norm of 17 pending deals logged during the holiday week.\nA sponsor unit at\n53 West 53rd Street\n, asking $23 million, was the priciest to snag a signed contract in the holiday week. The condo spans 3,700 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms and features views of Central Park.\nSales at the tower, developed by Pontiac Land Group and Hines, launched in 2015 and are now led by a team with Douglas Elliman\u2019s development marketing arm, including Renee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith.\nOther units at the building, known as the Museum of Modern Art tower, have also snagged top contracts, including in October, when a full-floor apartment found a buyer\nafter asking just under $47 million\n. The developers initially sought $51 million for the condo.\nAmenities at the 81-story building, completed in 2020, include a lap pool, fitness center, golf simulator and concierge.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a Greenwich Village townhouse asking just under $20 million. The five-story property at 152 West 13th Street, which hit the market in September, last traded in 2016 for $15 million, following a two-year renovation.\nThe 5,600-square-foot home has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and an elevator. It also features double-height ceilings in the great room, a landscaped garden and finished cellar.\nCompass\u2019 Aeen Avini and Lauren Pepin had the listing.\nLast year, another townhouse in Greenwich Village\nset a new record\nfor Downtown Manhattan when it sold in an off-market deal for $73 million. The double-wide home at 138-140 West 11th Street paved the way for another megamansion in the neighborhood to hit the market earlier this year, asking\n$75 million\n.\nOf the 19 properties, eight were condos, seven were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $189 million, which works out to an average price of $10 million and a median of $8 million. The typical home was on the market for more than two years and had a discount of 16 percent.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is shrugging off a national cooldown, chalking up the strongest price gains among the country\u2019s largest metros and widening the divide between the region and Sun Belt markets now slipping into reverse.\nOctober brought the sharpest monthly jump of the year, further cementing Chicago as one of the nation\u2019s outliers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. According to\nIllinois Realtors\n, the median sales price in the nine-county metro area hit $369,000 in October, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier. In the city, the median reached $370,000, up 7.2 percent. Nationally, prices rose just 2.1 percent that month, making Chicago\u2019s growth more than quadruple the pace of the U.S. overall.\nThe numbers reinforce a year-long stretch in which Chicago has consistently ranked near the top of major metro price charts. September data from the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index showed Chicago leading all 20 tracked metros with a 5.45 percent annual price growth.\nNew York, long the only big-city competitor rising faster, slipped to 5.25 percent. Eleven of the 20 metros posted price declines, highlighting what S&amp;P\u2019s Nicholas Godec called an accelerating deceleration nationwide.\nMany of the worst performers \u2014 Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas \u2014 are markets where pandemic-era run-ups are now unwinding, compounded in Florida by an\ninsurance crisis\ndragging on values. Chicago\u2019s slower, steadier appreciation during those frenzy years left it less exposed, and now it\u2019s a relative safe harbor. Price growth is cooling slightly from earlier Case-Shiller reports, but still handily outpacing inflation.\nSales, meanwhile, remain muted but stable. The city logged 1,782 closings in October, down 2.2 percent year-over-year, while the metro posted a 2 percent increase to 7,690. Year-to-date sales are up marginally \u2014 0.5 percent in the city and 1.3 percent metro-wide \u2014 putting the region on track to finish slightly better than 2024, which marked the slowest sales year since 2011.\nUnlike the overstocked conditions in much of the country, Chicago\u2019s inventory is still tight enough to keep prices rising but not so thin that buyers are boxed out. A Redfin analysis found local buyers outnumbered sellers by 2.7 percent in October, making\nChicago\none of just eight balanced markets among the nation\u2019s 50 largest. The gap is much larger nationwide, with available properties outnumbering buyers by about 37 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An estate in Hillsborough is going for the gold with a list price that could set a new record in the Silicon Valley enclave.\nVilla del Verano, occupied by private equity investor Ted Kruttschnitt and his wife Alexia, is on the market for $88 million, which if it sold at that number would be the highest amount paid for a house in the Peninsula town, Mansion Global\nreported\n. Jenn Gilson of Golden Gate Sotheby\u2019s International Realty holds the listing for the gated compound at 3000 Ralston Avenue.\nThe mansion sits on a 12.3-acre property and has garnered acclaim for its design inside and out. The home was envisioned by Architectural Digest 100 architect Andrew Skurman and Architectural Digest 100 designer Suzanne Tucker, and once received the California Landscape Contractors Association\u2019s Grand Sweepstakes Award for best residential real estate completed in California.\nThe design itself was inspired by\nItaly\u2019s famed Lake Como\n, at Kruttschnitt\u2019s request.\n\u201cWe visited Lake Como several times, and it was always special to us,\u201d Kruttschnitt told Mansion Global. The estate came together when the couple bought three adjacent properties in 2006, combined them into one and demolished the old homes on the parcels to build a grand new mansion.\nThe couple hired 110 subcontractors, including some from Europe, to complete the home over six years.The 12,404-square-foot house, finished in 2013, was designed to host large-scale events, with Kruttschnitt noting a recent black-tie event on the front lawn with 450 guests as an example. The 82-year-old philanthropist and his wife are offloading the property as he and his wife spend more time at their home in\nPalm Desert\n.\nThe home includes six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and 10 half baths as well as a 4,612-square-foot guest house with one bedroom and an office. The main house boasts a fitness center, a theater, a game room, a spa and a 2,100-gallon saltwater aquarium with tropical fish. Outside, there is a swimming pool, an 150-seat amphitheater, an event lawn, a two-story sports pavilion, courts for tennis, pickleball, volleyball, badminton, horseshoe, shuffleboard, and bocce ball, as well as a truncated golf course and a putting green.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "FPA Multifamily\npicked up a Streeterville tower for nearly $175 million, setting the high water mark for a Chicago multifamily sale this year.\nTrinity Property Consultants, a firm with ties to Greg Fowler\u2019s FPA Multifamily, bought the 398-unit apartment building at 340 East North Water Street from Miami-based developer\nCrescent Heights\n. The deal includes only the multifamily portion of the building \u2014 a 400-room Loews hotel occupies the rest of the building.\nThe sale is the priciest multifamily deal in the city this year, surpassing a Fulton Market apartment complex that sold\nfor $170 million in April\n. The Streeterville sale price, which came out to about $439,000 per unit, is slightly higher than the $173 million\nCrescent Heights paid\nfor the tower in 2023.\nBut the trade is still well below the $240.31 million that the previous owner, Invesco, paid for the property in 2016.\nCrescent Heights secured a $112 million Freddie Mac loan on the building in 2023 at an interest rate of 5.45 percent, maturing in July 2028, and it was assumable by a buyer. That was likely a selling point for FPA, offering relief from higher interest rates in today\u2019s market.\nWhen the building hit the market earlier this year, the property was listed as 93 percent occupied with average rents of $3,574 per unit. Newmark brokers Liz Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson represented Crescent Heights on the listing.\nNeither FPA nor Crescent Heights immediately responded to a request for comment.\nFor FPA, the acquisition is the latest in a buying spree across the Chicago area. The San Francisco-based firm bought a Naperville apartment complex in March for $68 million, a month after it\nsold a Downers Grove building\nto Laramar Group. FPA also purchased a 500-unit South Loop building in March 2024 for\n$144 million\n, following that up with a $60 million Oak Park tower\nin July 2024\nand another\nOak Park acquisition\nin August of that year.\nThe deal comes amid a busy multifamily market in Chicago, as landlords are looking to cash in on strong rent growth and a limited development pipeline. The North Water Street property was one of several\nmajor multifamily offerings\nto hit the market this year, including others in Streeterville like a 263-unit tower listed by Green Cities and The Streeter, a 481-unit building owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nElsewhere, Crescent Heights is planning a 52-story complex at 420 North May Street in Fulton Market. The firm bought the site for $34.5 million in 2023. In the Gold Coast, Crescent Heights is planning a\ncondo-to-rental conversion\nat 850 North Lake Shore Drive, which it bought at a discount for $80 million in 2024.\nNot all its developments have panned out: Crescent Heights\nsurrendered a South Loop development site\nthrough a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure where it had planned to build a tower up to 900 feet next to its existing 76-story Nema Chicago. The 43,000-square-foot vacant lot was handed over to lender Grupo Financiero Inbursa in May 2024 after the firm unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the property.\n",

Steven Ross, the Grand Prairie plastics titan who founded the parent company of Husky, platted the subdivision in 2007 and conveyed the property in 2008 to his daughter, Rachel Polka, the seller.\nConstruction and marketing have also been a family affair.

        "content": "The Manhattan office market pumped the brakes in November.\nLeasing activity dipped nearly 18 percent from October, despite a handful of big deals. Tenants inked deals for 2.99 million square feet, down about 12 percent year over year, according to a new Colliers report. Still, demand exceeded the borough\u2019s 10-year monthly average and pushed year-to-date activity to 36.7 million square feet, already ahead of last year\u2019s total.\nIf December holds pace, Manhattan could top 40 million square feet of leasing for the first time since 2019.\nA handful of headline-grabbing deals anchored the month, led by Millennium Management\u2019s 438,000-square-foot renewal at BXP\u2019s\n399 Park Avenue\n. That was followed by Rippling\u2019s 133,000-square-foot deal at Vornado\u2019s 330 West 34th Street and two 125,000-plus-square-foot leases at Vornado\u2019s\nPenn 2 by Robinhood\nand Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\nEven with the slowdown, availability dipped to 14.2 percent, its lowest level since late 2020, per Colliers. Net absorption remained positive at just over half a million square feet, while sublet supply continued its long unwind, falling for the 14th straight month to 11.8 million square feet, now below pre-pandemic levels.\nMidtown led the borough with 1.4 million square feet leased, though volume slipped 9 percent from October and nearly 30 percent year over year. Availability in the submarket fell slightly to 12.8 percent from 13 percent, helped by a lack of new space coming on the market and falling sublet inventory. Average asking rents to $82.29 per square foot, about 4 percent lower than March 2020.\nMidtown South recorded 1.23 million square feet of leasing, driven by tech and retail tenants. Downtown leasing tumbled to 356,000 square feet, half of October\u2019s total, but more than double what it was last year, per Colliers. Availability ticked up to 17.6 percent as demand dropped and 205,000 square feet of sublet space hit the market at 1 New York Plaza.\n",

        "content": "Transit-oriented development\nis driving multifamily projects in Los Angeles.\nDevelopers are increasingly chasing density bonuses near rail stations in the hope that renters will flock to the new residences for walkability and transit convenience, L.A. Business First\nreported\n. The financial reprieves from\npermitted upzoning\nthrough Los Angeles\u2019 Transit-Oriented Communities Incentive Program have attracted developers looking to get shovels in the dirt faster.\nThe program has \u201csupercharged housing production\u201d across the city, Martin Leitner, a principal at Nadel Architects, told L.A. Business First. At the end of 2024,\nL.A. Metro\nfound that more than 110 projects were in development through the Transit-Oriented Communities program; that included more than 11,000 affordable and market-rate housing units. L.A. Metro has helped contribute to construction by aiding in the development of 5,000 units near its stations across Los Angeles County and aiming for 10,000 units by 2031.\nIntroduced in 2016, Los Angeles\u2019 Transit-Oriented Communities program gives developers\ntax incentives\nto build residences within a half-mile of a major transit stop. Developers must designate some housing as affordable units in order to qualify. Incentives are structured in tiers based on proximity to transit stations and the type of transit service offered.\nBuilders are trying to \u201cfollow the money,\u201d according to KWP Real Estate agent Lee Shapiro. \u201cDevelopers are looking at what can be financed and what can be built based on the cost of the land,\u201d Shapiro said. In a market facing high rates and shifting land values, Transit-Oriented Development could prove especially attractive if interest rates ease in the coming months.\u201d\n\u201cWe do see a lot of developers come out of the woodwork and start taking some risk on development, and that is [the] growth of multifamily,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cOften offices will come along with that. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of available office space in Los Angeles, but typically I would anticipate we\u2019d see the trend of increased rental rates and new growth and development.\u201d\nA building boom could be on the horizon if economic headwinds begin to clear. As it stands, developers still face high construction costs, tariffs, economic uncertainty and high interest rates, presenting sometimes insurmountable hurdles for builders looking to get to work at the transit stop-proximal sites.\n\u201cWith a lot of capital still on the sidelines because the market\u2019s tough and projects are penciling, those [transit-oriented development] projects in good, destination-rich, transit-oriented locations are going to be the first to come off the sidelines,\u201d Leitner said, noting that it\u2019s already happening.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Houston inventory is rising, while listings in the rest of Texas are dropping.\nOnce again,\nHouston has the biggest housing inventory in the country\n, with over 42,000 active listings in October. That\u2019s about 1,400 more homes than September and 7,000 more homes than last October, putting it in first place for year-over-year home inventory growth, according to Homes.com senior director of market analytics Itziar Aguirre.\nTexas marked second as well as first place. Dallas/Fort Worth has the second-biggest housing inventory in the country, according to Homes.com. However, unlike other Texas metros, Houston continues to heap homes onto the shelves, even in the face of a\nbuyer\u2019s market shift\nthat has\nmany sellers leaving the market.\nHouston is the only metro in the Texas Triangle to see inventory increase in the past few months, according to CoStar. Homeowners around the country are increasingly deciding to take their homes off the market and wait for better conditions; in Houston, though, a boom in\nmaster-planned community projects\nappears to be countering the resale market\u2019s decline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a lot of\nmaster-planned communities\npop up, even today at this interest rate, so that\u2019s keeping inventory high. Especially west and north of Houston,\u201d Aguirre said.\nMonth-over-month, housing inventory has shrunk in Dallas since July. The Austin housing market has also contracted, dipping from 16,500 homes for sale in July to 14,700 in October. San Antonio has slowed as well, though its inventory ticked up in September before decreasing again in October.\nAll the while, the number of homes for sale in Houston has increased, month-over-month.\nHouston was already crowned king of master-planned communities in January after year-end data showed that\na plurality of the 50 best-selling master-planned communities in 2024 were in the Bayou City\n. The pipeline has remained full all year with projects by\nStarwood Land\n,\nBrookfield\n,\nHines\n,\nFriendswood Development Company and D.R. Horton\ntaking shape. Over a fifth of all master-planned community sales in the country take place in Houston.\nWhile single-family home inventory grew 16 percent, year-over-year in October, townhomes and condos grew by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.\nKaty and Lake Conroe saw the highest increase in active listings in the region, year-over-year.\n",

The 360-unit project is being developed at 701 Newark Avenue in the city\u2019s Journal Square neighborhood.\nGoldman Sachs provided the financing for the 34-story development through its Urban Investment Group. The financing takes the shape of a construction loan, bridge facility, low-income housing tax credit equity and other public capital.\nA JLL team including Jimmy Cochran, Nicco Lupo and Jillian Grzywacz advised on the financing deal. The developer previously scored a $90 million tax credit award through the state\u2019s Aspire program.\nBreaking ground this week, Homestead Gateway will include 270 market-rate units and 90 affordable housing units on the former site of a municipal parking lot, according to\nMulti-Housing News\n.\nAmenities will include a rooftop lounge, fitness center, bicycle storage and workspaces. There will also be 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space in the building, which is being designed by C3D Architecture.\n\u201cWe are very proud to be building this project, which brings both market rate and affordable housing, provides hundreds of union jobs and completes Homestead Place, a pedestrian walkway that will give easy Manhattan access to thousands of PATH train commuters,\u201d Lions Group NYC\u2019s Aaron Shirian told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile cheaper than its Manhattan neighbor, Jersey City is emerging as one of the nation\u2019s most expensive rental markets. Last month, the average rent was $3,152, according to Apartments.com, 93 percent higher than the national average. Apartment rents rose 2.4 percent in the last 12 months, according to a recent report from PwC and the Urban Land Institute.\nEvery developer wants a piece of the action. Over the summer, Namdar Group\nsecured\n$358 million in construction financing from Tyko Capital for two mixed-use projects in Journal Square, totaling 1,126 units.\nKushner Companies is also among those investing heavily in the neighborhood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago buyers can\u2019t seem to catch a break, be they entry-level shoppers, mid-tier movers or even the deep-pocketed crowd.\nHome prices across all three slices of the metro\u2019s for-sale market rose faster in October than in most of the nation\u2019s major metros, tightening affordability even as many warm weather markets saw relief, according to data by First American Data &amp; Analytics, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nPrices at the bottom and top of Chicago\u2019s market \u2014 what First American tags as starter homes and\nluxury properties\n\u2014 were each up 6.5 percent, year-over-year. Mid-tier homes weren\u2019t far behind at 5.5 percent. That level of\nacross-the-board escalation\noutpaced more than 10 other major metros, and contrasted sharply with places where prices have slipped in all tiers.\nChicago trailed only New York at the high end, where upper-tier prices spiked nearly 15 percent.\nOdeta Kushi, First American\u2019s deputy chief economist, pointed to the Chicago region\u2019s long-running relative affordability as a key reason Chicago is still seeing\nprice strength\n, despite stiff headwinds. Elevated mortgage rates, revived return-to-office policies and general economic anxiety have cooled activity nationally. Yet Chicago, which held onto its affordability edge better than any major city over the past 50 years, still gives buyers room to stretch \u2014 even after the pandemic boom pushed local prices sharply higher.\nThe buoyancy is good news for sellers, but not for households trying to break into the market. The fastest pace of growth in Chicago\u2019s entry-level tier suggests that demand hasn\u2019t eased for homes at about $275,000 and below, based on Midwest Real Estate Data figures. Inflation has already strained budgets for moderate-income buyers, and another mid-single-digit jump in prices only tightens the vise.\nChicago\u2019s upper tier is also having a banner year. While New York\u2019s surge is driven by a jump in $5 million-plus condo and co-op deals \u2014 90 contracts in October, according to Corcoran \u2014 Chicago is charting its own\nluxury rally\n. Three homes sold for $9 million or more in October, and sales at $4 million and up set a full year record before Thanksgiving, now on track to hit roughly 150 deals.\nKushi said several big metros, including Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, are showing \u201ctop-led\u201d markets this year. But Chicago stands out for seeing price pressure from both ends.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The development team overseeing the Stockyards\u2019 splashiest recent bets is gearing up for another. Majestic Realty, co-developer of Mule Alley and the Hotel Drover, is sketching out a significant redo of the century-old Stockyards Hotel, a property that has long traded on its Old West lore but hasn\u2019t seen a full refresh in decades.\nThe first hints surfaced last year, when Fort Worth Heritage Development \u2014 Majestic\u2019s partnership with the Hickman family \u2014 filed plans for a $20 million renovation of the 50-key hotel at 109 East Exchange Avenue, a gateway spot near the district\u2019s western entrance, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. New filings in mid-November offer a closer look, according to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation records. Majestic\nsubmitted permits\nto remodel the building and add new outdoor structures, including a 990-square-foot rear canopy, and a 1,344-square-foot front canopy that would help reposition the hotel\u2019s street presence.\nAnother filing with TDLR pegs the canopy work and deck replacement at about $1.5 million. A separate $1.6 million permit covers upgrades to H3 Ranch and\nBooger Red\u2019s Saloon\n\u2014 the hotel\u2019s wood-smoked anchor and its adjoining bar \u2014 with new kitchen equipment, lighting and mechanical systems on deck. The filings list Dallas-based Nunzio Marc DeSantis Architects, a hospitality specialist with a long resume in luxury design, as the architect of record. Work is tentatively slated to begin in January 2026.\nMajestic confirmed the filings, but cautioned that the project isn\u2019t locked in. Rick Kline, who oversees Stockyards operations for the firm, said the company remains \u201cearly in the planning process\u201d and declined to elaborate on scope or timeline.\nThe property\u2019s bones are historic, if not pristine. Built in 1907, the Stockyards Hotel has hosted outlaws, crooners and cattle barons, and today advertises 42 rooms and 10 suites priced from about $129 a night to $649 a night. Its last major overhaul came in the early 1980s, when local businessmen reopened it after a top-to-bottom renovation.\nThe latest effort comes as Majestic navigates\nleadership shake-ups\nand a legal battle with former executive\nCraig Cavileer\n, whose ownership stakes across several Stockyards properties were auctioned in May. The firm has said the district pulls roughly 9 million visitors a year, but its broader 300,000-square-foot expansion plan remains unresolved, in part because an economic development deal with the city has yet to be finalized.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Pyramid Management Group is going through hard times with much of its portfolio, but it received a lifeline for its Crossgates properties in New York.\nPyramid landed more than $200 million in financing for a pair of retail properties, the Times Union\nreported\n. The financing is split between $193 million for the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland and $13.8 million for the Crossgates Commons shopping center in Albany.\nBoth of the deals take the form of five-year finance loans. The developer said in a release announcing the deal that the financing \u201cenables Pyramid to reinvest in the properties, ensuring their vitality, vibrancy and sustained success in the market.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear who the lender is for the properties and if it\u2019s the same lender for each of them. Each retail complex, however, has endured challenges in recent years.\nIn August 2023, an unidentified lender\npurchased $243 million in mortgage debt\nbacked by the Crossgates Mall at auction. The debt was sold at a big discount and bondholders lost $100 million in the deal, according to Trepp.\nThe debt had been downgraded in March of that year, two months before the Syracuse-based developer defaulted on three mortgages tied to the mall.\nAnchors at the mall include Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Primark and Best Buy. REI and Crunch Fitness are among the recent additions and Ashley Furniture is scheduled to open an outpost next year; the property is 90 percent occupied, according to Pyramid chief executive officer Stephen Congel.\nMeanwhile, New York City-based real estate lender Argentic provided a 10-year loan to\nrefinance\nthe Crossgates Commons debt in 2022.\nIn the last year, Pyramid lost the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York, and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, to foreclosure. This fall, a loan tied to its Palisades Mall in Rockland County was\nsettled\nwith significant losses for securities holders.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The 168,000-square-foot building sold for roughly $469 per square foot.\nIt is in Pasadena\u2019s 210-technology corridor, less than 15 minutes away from California Institute of Technology. Neither the buyer nor seller responded to requests for information.\nAlvarez &amp; Marsal bought the property from San Francisco-based Graymark Capital for $33 million four years ago. It has an alternative address of 3100 New York Drive and is described as a two-story creative office and industrial building.\nGraymark\npurchased\na two-building office campus nearby at 2923 and 2947 Bradley Street for $30 million six years ago.

Pricing details remain under wraps, and the deal hasn\u2019t closed, however Lone Star\u2019s interest tracks with its latest\n$2.7 billion opportunistic fund\n, raised in late 2024 to target commercial properties under lender pressure.\nWith about $95 billion under management, the firm has been blunt about its strategy. Lone Star recently bought a major downtown Denver tower for $132.5 million, and teamed with Miami partners on Fort Lauderdale\u2019s\nBank of America Plaza\nfor $221 million.\n\u201cMost transactions we see and expect are from the banks facing pressure to de-lever their books,\u201d Jerome Foulon, Lone Star\u2019s global head of commercial real estate, told Private Equity Real Estate when the fund closed. \u201cA lot of investors have recognized this is a\nLone Star\nkind of market.\u201d\nFew assets fit that bill better than 600 California. A WeWork and Rhone Advisors venture bought the 359,880-square-foot tower in 2019 for about $323 million \u2014 that\u2019s just under $900 per square foot \u2014 betting on a model that paired\nWeWork\u2019s\nleases with ownership of its buildings. Then the pandemic gutted office demand and slashed valuations.\nBy spring 2023, the venture had defaulted on its $240 million loan. Lenders sued, seeking a receiver and judicial foreclosure; WeWork\u2019s bankruptcy filing followed later that year.\nA court appointed Trigild as receiver in November 2023, and lenders paused foreclosure while testing the market. Trigild hired Newmark to market the property in September of this year. The appraised value has plunged to roughly $109 million, less than a third of its 2019 price, according to CMBS data.\nWeWork, which once occupied more than half the tower, eventually opted to keep its lease, but slimmed its space to about 43,000 square feet under renegotiated terms.\nDistressed inventory remains deep in San Francisco, and 600 California exemplifies it. In August, JLL, which handles leasing at 600 California, was advertising more than 270,000 square feet in the building for lease, meaning the building is roughly 75 percent vacant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Berkeley-based developer would have to demolish the existing 29-unit apartment complex that the firm owns on the 1.4-acre lot.\nThe project is currently being reviewed by the City of Walnut Creek under California\u2019s Housing Accountability Act and the State Density Bonus Law. Of the 87 units, at least half will be two- and three-bedroom apartments. Satellite Affordable aims to receive concessions to reduce required parking to 62 spaces from 132 and requested concessions to increase the height limit and interior setbacks. If completed, Sierra Garden Apartments would comprise a six-story building with ground-floor community space, laundry rooms, an outdoor garden, a patio and a pool.\nSatellite Affordable previously turned the 29-unit building on the site into a mixed-income complex. The parcel is in a prime location for redevelopment, having been identified as a possible building site for more housing in the city\u2019s housing element.\nWhile new state laws governing things like environmental review and density bonuses have cleared some development obstacles and made the approval process quicker, developers are still facing challenges from national issues. Namely, those pursuing multifamily and single-family projects have to contend with high construction costs, tariffs, economic uncertainty and high interest rates. In order to fund Sierra Garden Apartments, Satellite Affordable plans\nto use both private and public funding including low-income tax credits.\nUnder Walnut Creek\u2019s housing element, the city must plan for 5,805 new units by 2031, with 3,501 of those being affordable, Contra Costa News\nreported\n. It remains unclear when final review for Sierra Garden Apartments will kick off or when construction could begin.\nElsewhere in Walnut Creek, last month, Concord-based DeNova Homes submitted paperwork to build a 112-unit, five-story apartment building\non the site of Putter\u2019s Miniature Golf\nat 1271-1275 South California Boulevard.

        "content": "Gail Sankarsingh, a longtime New York City luxury agent, died Friday at the age of 57.\nBorn in Trinidad, Sankarsingh moved to New York City in 1986 as a teenager and joined Douglas Elliman in 2007.\nSankarsingh built her business with prominent Manhattan new development projects, including the historic\nApthorp on the Upper West Side\n, the\nBaccarat Residences in Midtown\nand The Centrale in Midtown East, before pivoting in recent years to focus on resales. She consistently placed among the top-producing agents at her firm, earning fifth in gross commission income among individual Elliman agents in the city in 2017.\nElliman CEO Michael Liebowitz, along with Elliman\u2019s New York City CEO Richard Ferrari and and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing CEO Susan de Fran\u00e7a, announced Sankarsingh\u2019s death in an internal memo.\n\u201cShe understood that New York is the epicenter of the world, and she embodied that cosmopolitan spirit in everything she did,\u201d the memo read.\nSankarsingh died following years of battling cancer on and off.\nBrokers from Elliman remembered Sankarsingh as unfailingly positive, even in the face of a difficult diagnosis.\n\u201cYou would never think she was going through something so difficult,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Alexander Boriskin, who knew Sankarsingh for close to a decade. \u201cShe was super positive, always in a good mood, always smiling.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a broker that nobody ever had a bad thing to say about,\u201d added Elliman\u2019s Michael Lorber.\nKim Shepard, another Elliman agent, said the two hit it off when they met nearly two decades ago, bonding over being single mothers and sharing an unbridled love of the city. The two hunkered down during the pandemic together, going for walks in Central Park four or five days a week before shopping on Madison Avenue, another one of Sankarsingh\u2019s favorite pastimes.\n\u201cShe liked the nice things in life,\u201d said Shepard, pointing to backyard happy hours where Sankarsingh got a case of champagne delivered. \u201cShe said, \u2018This is for when I visit.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cShe was so full of life,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s MariaElena Scotto, who said after heading to the brokerage\u2019s annual Endeavor event in Las Vegas at the end of October, Sankarsingh made time to see the Hoover Dam and catch an Eagles concert at the Sphere arena.\nOnline, agents expressed shock at the news after having just seen Sankarsingh in high spirits so recently. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d Scotto said. \u201cBecause she said, \u2018I can\u2019t have any negativity.\u2019\u201d\nSankarsingh is survived by her son, Christian Foley Sankarsingh, and her niece, Schuyler Sankarsingh-Ali, who are also both agents at Elliman, as well as her mother, Mavis Nandoo, sister Debra, and brothers Neil, Lincoln and Darrel.",

        "content": "NYC is slated to get three casinos. The state board that approved the proposals, however, has some reservations.\nAs largely\nexpected\n, the Gaming Facility Location Board on Monday recommended that the remaining three casino proposals \u2014 Bally\u2019s Bronx, Hard Rock Metropolitan Park and Resorts World New York City \u2014 receive state casino licenses.\nThe board determined that awarding all three licenses \u201cbest advances the state\u2019s long-term economic, fiscal and community objectives.\u201d\nThe proposals now head to the state Gaming Commission, which will ensure the applicants abide by New York\u2019s licensing requirements. That assessment, as board Chair Vicki Been pointed out, will include \u201cdetermining the character and fitness and the integrity of the applicants.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not a rubber stamp. I can tell you, having now spent many, many hours with the Gaming Commission team, they are an incredibly hard-working, dedicated, thorough, exacting and tough group to get through,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they ask the right questions.\u201d\nThis may sound ominous, but it becomes less so if you consider how many things the board found potentially wrong with the three proposals while still ultimately recommending that they receive a license.\nIn a 29-page report released Monday afternoon, the board details its evaluation of each proposal, including concerns about the applicants\u2019 ability to deliver on various commitments made to their surrounding communities.\nFor all of the applicants, the board was disappointed that they didn\u2019t make \u201cbinding commitments about the diversity of their workforces beyond best-efforts pledges.\u201d The report states that the board is concerned about the \u201cfeasibility of meeting construction workforce MWBE goals, given disparities between the makeup of many of the construction-related unions and the stated targets.\u201d\nThe board also views the estimated construction timelines for the projects as potentially overly optimistic.\nBut one of the board\u2019s biggest concerns seems to be the prospect of teams either backtracking or otherwise failing to keep the promises they made to advance in the casino competition. The report repeatedly urges local and state agencies to monitor the progress of these commitments.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the most notable issues raised in the report for each proposed casino:\nResorts World New York City\nThe\nreport raises concerns about Genting\u2019s financing plan, pointing to the fact that it relies on future operating cash flow and debt. The company has $925 million in committed debt financing and will need to raise more. The report notes the risk of funding shortfalls if this money doesn\u2019t materialize, \u201cpotentially requiring further capital support to complete the project from its parent, an affiliate, or third parties.\u201d\nThe board also flags that, among firms under the Genting Group umbrella, there\u2019s a \u201chistory of projects delivered late or over budget, often due to scope increases, and its underperformance at some U.S. properties.\u201d\nThe board\u2019s consultants believe Genting\u2019s annual revenue projections are also too high. The consultants projected that the project\u2019s gaming tax revenue would total more than $4 billion over 10 years. The project team estimated that its facility would generate more than $1 billion in revenue each year.\nThe Resorts World team committed to the highest tax rates of any of the casino applicants, but has indicated that it now wants to lower that rate, according to the report. The high tax rate was one of the \u201cdeterminative factors\u201d that led the board to recommend Resorts World to the Gaming Commission, and the report warns that any reduction in that rate \u201cwould undermine the Community Advisory Committee process.\u201d\nThe report also notes that Genting reached an agreement with Cirrus Real Estate Partners to build 50,000 workforce housing units across the city but that \u201cthe substance of the project is vague.\u201d\nBally\u2019s Bronx\nThe board found Bally\u2019s project record to be \u201cmixed\u201d and noted that the company will need to \u201cclosely manage\u201d and prioritize the development.\nThe report also cites concern over the company\u2019s\nhigh leverag\ne and said Bally\u2019s needs to \u201coversee its liquidity carefully.\u201d\nWhile the report states that the Bally\u2019s proposal includes detailed plans to promote energy efficiency, the board found that it \u201cdid not sufficiently address stormwater management or long-term climate resiliency.\u201d\nPreliminary designs for the parking garages raised questions about traffic flow. The board also called the placement of physical screening over the two garages \u201cunusual and aesthetically suboptimal.\u201d\nHard Rock Metropolitan Park\nThis casino team didn\u2019t include a number of already-public project commitments in its application to the state. Those included turning part of one of the project\u2019s garages into a \u201cTaste of Queens\u201d food hall, and a\npledge\nto build 450 affordable housing units off-site.\nThe application also didn\u2019t include Flushing Skypark, which was\nkey\nto securing support from Sen. John Liu. The board is recommending that the Gaming Commission require that these projects be completed as a condition of granting the team a license.\nSimilar to Bally\u2019s, plans for Metropolitan Park do \u201cnot sufficiently address stormwater management or long-term climate resiliency,\u201d according to the report.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Using \u201caesthetically suboptimal\u201d for inspiration, what is the best euphemistic way to say a building\u2019s design is ugly? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Zohran Mamdani may, in fact, be the city\u2019s 112th mayor. Historian Paul Hortenstine found that in 1674 Mayor Matthias Nicolls served a second, nonconsecutive term, which is not reflected in the city\u2019s official count,\nGothamist reports\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Starbucks has agreed to pay $38.9 million to settle claims that it violated the city\u2019s law guaranteeing fair working conditions,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The city\u2019s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found that the company \u201carbitrarily cut schedules and illegally prioritized their own profits over their workers\u2019 rights\u201d across more than 300 locations. As part of the settlement, more than 15,000 hourly workers will receive payments.\n\u2014 Assembly member Harvey Epstein, who is vacating his seat early to join the City Council next month, endorsed City Council member Keith Powers to succeed him,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. \u201cKeith Powers has been a consistent champion for tenants \u2013 protecting affordability, fighting displacement and supporting a rent freeze to keep families in their homes,\u201d Epstein said in a statement. \u201cHaving represented AD 74, I know how critical strong tenant leadership is. Keith is exactly the person we need in Albany to carry that work forward.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$5.9 million\nfor a condominium unit at 15 West 96th Street. The new Upper West Side condo is 2,700 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nShane Boyle, Theresa Persaud, Will Ortman and Francesca Paone have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$130 million\nfor 97 West Street. The industrial site has multiple warehouses across 67,000 square feet of floor area.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $14 million for a condo at 1228 Madison Avenue. The 3,5000 square-foot unit is on the Upper East Side.\nCompass\u2019\nJulie Pham and Angela Remigio have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 13,185-square-foot residential building at 196 East Seventh Street in the East Village. Andrew Goodrich of Bealin Groups Corp is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Billy Macklowe has snapped up the troubled loan on a Tribeca office building.\nThe William Macklowe Company bought the $46 million note tied to 291 Broadway as the loan barreled toward foreclosure,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. Lender Flagstar Bank sold the note to Macklowe for slightly less than the balance of about $45 million, per a source with knowledge of the deal.\nThe note sale comes after Flagstar sued owner Sutton Management in July to foreclose on the 129,000-square-foot property, alleging the borrower stopped making payments at the end of 2024. As of June 30, the landlord allegedly owed $48.6 million in principal and other fees, according to court documents. The property went into receivership in August.\nThe 10-story building, at the corner of Broadway and Reade Street, was built in 1911 and originally housed the East River Savings Bank. If Macklowe forecloses or takes a deed-in-lieu, the building could be next in line for a residential conversion. Newmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Joshua King brokered the note sale.\nNew York Community Bank, now known as Flagstar, provided the $46 million loan in late 2019, when office values were still near their peak. But the post-pandemic office slump has been particularly punishing for older, non-Class A buildings downtown, where rising vacancies, leasing concessions and higher interest rates have strained owners\u2019 cash flow.\nThe building\u2019s largest tenant is dance studio Downtown Dance Factory, which occupies 13,000 square feet on the fourth and fifth floors, according to CoStar data. Earlier this year, law firm Rose &amp; Rose left 291 Broadway after 30 years in the building, according to the Commercial Observer. The building is 95.8 percent leased, per CoStar.\nOther current tenants include law firms Mirman, Markovits &amp; Landau and Neil Weinrib &amp; Associates and Ya Ya Mandarin Immersion Preschool.\nBilly Macklowe, the son of real estate heavyweight Harry Macklowe, left his dad\u2019s company in 2010 to start his own real estate development and investment firm. Macklowe recently completed construction of a\nmixed-use development\nin Park Slope, his first Brooklyn development. Macklowe also developed a 52-unit condo building at\n21 East 12th Street\n.\nSutton Management\u2019s Abraham Sutton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Macklowe declined to comment.\nRich Bockmann contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "Nearly two years after the\nlargest single-day federal bribery takedown\nin the Justice Department\u2019s history, federal prosecutors secured a perfect record on convictions.\nAll 70 New York City Housing Authority employees swept up in a corruption sweep were convicted, Gothamist\nreported\n. Charges ranged from bribery to fraud and extortion.\nA vast majority of those charged pleaded guilty to felonies, though 11 pleaded guilty to misdemeanors. Only three took it to trial, all resulting in convictions.\nAll told, the numerous defendants accepted more than $2.1 million in bribes combined, according to federal prosecutors. In exchange for the payouts, the defendants steered more than $15 million in contracts.\nThe cash kickbacks ranged from roughly $500 to $2,000, accounting for 10 to 20 percent of any contract\u2019s given value. Payment was often demanded upfront or prior to signing off on work to unlock NYCHA payments.\nIt all came crashing down in early February 2024 when agents from the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, Homeland Security and the office of the Inspector General for Housing and Urban Development apprehended 66 staffers, including at NYCHA complexes.\nThe superintendents charged allegedly took advantage of their power in \u201cno-bid\u201d contracts, which are worth below an estimated $10,000 and can be awarded by supers without going through a public bidding process. The policy is designed to accelerate the procurement process on contracts for small repairs and minor construction in public housing.\nBut it also opens up opportunities for corruption within the country\u2019s largest public housing authority, which is supported by $1.5 billion in annual federal funding.\nDespite the 2024 arrests, the problem still persists. Last April, 14 months after the bust, vendors confessed that NYCHA still handed out\nhundreds of contracts\nworth a combined $7.8 million to eight companies whose operators have confessed to participating in the kickback scheme.\nThe defendants will have to pay more than $2.1 million in restitution to the housing authority, as well as $2 million in criminal proceeds. They could also face up to two years in jail, according to\nBisnow\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Dan Dagesse, the head of a Northeast car dealership empire, sold his Stone Creek Ranch mansion for $30.5 million.\nIt\u2019s a steep price cut from the $47.5 million Degasse listed it for in May. Records show his LLC sold the home at 16101 Quiet Vista Circle in unincorporated Palm Beach County to David M. and Stephanie A. Fultz. The 17,100-square-foot home sold for $1,784 per square foot.\nColleen Keeley Nouhan and Carmen D\u2019Angelo with Premier Estate Properties had the listing, and Michael Costello with Compass brought the buyers.\nDagesse is the chairman of Norwood, Massachusetts-based DCD Automotive Holdings, the parent company of the car dealership network Nucar. It has more than 30 locations across New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and Pennsylvania, according to its website.\nRecords show he bought the 2.5-acre property for $2 million in 2018. Since then,\nStone Creek Ranch\nhas emerged as one of Palm Beach County\u2019s most coveted gated neighborhoods, attracting buyers like\nMark Wahlberg\nand Rockstar Energy billionaire\nRussell Weiner\n.\nDagesse built the mansion in 2023, designed by AK Build &amp; Design, Brenner Architectural Group and Michael Gray Interiors. The compound includes a main house with seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a gym and spa, a club room, a two-lane bowling alley, a tennis court and a putting green.\nZillow shows the total sale price as $39.8 million, a number not reflected in records that likely includes furniture and other personal items.\nThe deal marks the latest in a string of pricey deals in the neighborhood. Wahlberg dropped $32.6 million on his 2.7-acre estate in October. Weiner, who legally changed his name to Russell Savage, went into contract on two homes in the neighborhood last month, bringing his total spend in Stone Creek to\nmore than $40 million\n.\nAgents say that buyers are drawn to Stone Creek\u2019s security and seclusion, and that, unlike many other gated communities nearby, it has no golf club or course.\n",

It has been bolstered by a combination of solid fundamentals, relatively affordable properties and capital eager for investment in the wake of the pandemic.\nLakewood Center\n,\nThe Oaks\nin Thousand Oaks and\nLong Beach Towne Center\nhave all traded hands over the past year, often at discounts from their mid-2010s valuations.\nIn Southern California \u201cyou have this dense suburbia with a lot of large parcels that haven\u2019t been unlocked for a very long time,\u201d Cole Perry, associate director of research for real estate analytics firm Altus Group, told CO. \u201cThe minute one comes up\u2026 It\u2019s why they trade for nine figures, because you go to another city in the Midwest where density is probably half of what it is in Orange County, and, even if you were to convert a large property [in the Midwest] into a different use, it just doesn\u2019t have the same kind of draw that one in Southern California would.\u201d\nLakewood Center sold for $332.1 million in August, down from its $630 million appraisal 10 years ago. It drew heavy bidder interest thanks to its scale and location. Now, new owners Pacific Retail Capital Partners, Lyon Living and Silverpeak plan to turn the roughly 2-million-square-foot shopping center, one of the best-performing in California, into a mixed-use community similar to The Grove.\nCenterCal and DRA Advisors are pursuing similar upgrades at Long Beach Towne Center, adding chef-driven dining, wellness tenants and family-oriented programming.\nStockdale Capital Partners is plotting a full repositioning at The Oaks in Thousand Oaks, betting that relevance, not its 1.2-million-square-foot size, determines a mall\u2019s future. The idea is that because consumers tend to drive to malls for shopping as well as food and other experiences, it\u2019s best to serve as many of those needs as possible.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A sprawling townhouse community in Chicago\u2019s far northwest suburbs is testing investor appetite for one of the region\u2019s largest deconversion plays in years.\nOwners of all 220 units at Treehouse in the Woods in Round Lake are targeting a $59.5 million bulk sale and a full shift to rentals, according to 33 Realty, which is marketing the deal, CoStar\nreported\n. The asking price is just under $270,500 per unit.\nBulk deconversions \u2014 in which all individually owned units are sold to a single buyer and reverted to rentals \u2014 helped reshape Chicago\u2019s\nmultifamily landscape\nafter the condo glut of the early 2000s. The practice remains largely a Chicago-and-Florida phenomenon, but activity has slowed as interest rates rose and multifamily development cooled.\nChicago has produced some headline-grabbing deconversions in recent years \u2014 River City\u2019s 448 units in the South Loop, the 293-unit Century Tower in the Loop, and big suburban efforts like the 357-unit building at Schaumburg\u2019s\n21 Kristin Drive\n. But the pipeline has thinned. Prolific condo deconversion buyer Strategic Properties of North America, based in Skokie, had two big downtown Chicago deals\nfall apart\nin the last two years.\nRising rates and softer multifamily returns\nstalled many candidates\n. Still, the region\u2019s rental market has outpaced other major metros on rent growth, opening the door for conversions to reemerge as a practical alternative for condo associations that may need to to shell out for expensive repairs.\nDeconversions aren\u2019t without\ncontroversy\n. Illinois law requires 75 percent of owners to approve a bulk sale, and Chicago raises the bar to 85 percent to protect holdouts. Critics say reluctant owners can be forced out; proponents argue that bulk deals let owners sell at a premium and sidestep costly assessments.\nSean Connelly of 33 Realty, who is leading the Round Lake listing with colleagues Liam Moore and Matthew Petersen, said the pendulum may be swinging back as construction pipelines thin out and apartment rents climb.\nThe 27.5-acre Round Lake property offers something slightly different from typical urban deconversions: two- and three-bedroom townhouses built in 1996 with attached parking and balconies, spread across Treehouse and Whispering Oaks lanes and Macgillis Drive.\nAbout half the units are already rented, a marker that financing hurdles for new buyers may have nudged the association toward a bulk sale. The layout resembles a turnkey entry for investors looking to get into the booming build-to-rent sector \u2014 without the cost or timing risk of ground-up construction.\nConnelly told the outlet that suburban rents remain strong, especially for single-family-style rentals where the tenant stays an average of around five years, reducing turnover costs. Light rehabs and amenity upgrades could push rents higher, he added, giving a potential buyer the value-add room that\u2019s been scarce in today\u2019s high-cost construction climate.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Scott Henry\u2019s newest plan will restore a Queen Anne-style, brick and limestone\u00a0 landmark built in 1881 on Chicago\u2019s South Side to the tune of $85 million.\nThe Roseland native\u2019s firm,\nCeladon Partners\n, won a request for proposals from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to revive the historic Hotel Florence in the Pullman neighborhood, Henry told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nAfter moving to Texas as a child, Henry maintained his family roots on the South Side.\n\u201cIt was always my goal to return here and be a part of Roseland\u2019s comeback story,\u201d he said.\nHe could be on his way to achieving that. Hotel Florence, at 11111 South Forrestville Avenue, marks one of several real estate projects Henry has pursued in the area. Next door to Roseland, Celadon previously converted the\nWest Pullman Elementary\nformer school building into a 60-unit senior housing property as part of a roughly $20 million project.\nWith Celadon\u2019s latest plan in Pullman for Hotel Florence, the firm is echoing its ongoing transformation of\nEvanston\u2019s Harley Clarke Mansion\ninto a boutique hotel and event venue.\nThe Hotel Florence restoration includes spending a little more than $50 million to turn it into a boutique hotel with a bar, restaurant and affordable housing geared toward performing artists, plus a little more than $30 million to create an event venue within the adjacent Pullman factory complex. The plan will tap about $21\u202fmillion in state funding earmarked for the project, along with historic tax credits and other financing. It also includes a 75\u2011year public\u2011private lease for the hotel and factory annex that will allow Celadon or its successor to operate the property under state ownership.\nBuilt by industrial\u2011era pioneer George Pullman and designed by architect Solon Spencer Beman, Hotel Florence originally served as lodging for visiting railroad executives and supply representatives linked to the Pullman Palace Car Company. The four\u2011story building featured cherry\u2011wood parlors, stained glass, Eastlake\u2011era furnishings and a wraparound veranda \u2014 a symbol of Victorian\u2011era opulence in what was otherwise a working class company town.\nBut for decades the hotel has languished, closed to regular use since the early 2000s under state ownership. Occasional tours and cultural events have been held on the grounds, but nothing like the sweeping adaptive\u2011reuse Celadon now envisions.\nIn announcing the winning bid, Henry emphasized a cultural dimension: Not only will the redevelopment include affordable housing marketed toward artists, but the event venue programming will be managed in partnership with well-known rapper Che \u201cRhymefest\u201d Smith\u2019s organization, Art of Culture. It plans to bring emerging Chicago\u2011area talent and touring national acts into the future Pullman event venue. The proposal also envisions linking Hotel Florence with Celadon\u2019s upcoming project at the Evanston lakefront\u2019s Harley Clarke site. In Henry\u2019s words, the two projects will \u201ccreate more amazing collaborations.\u201d\nThat\u2019s no empty branding. In late 2024 Celadon won the rights to redevelop the Harley Clarke Mansion at 2603\u202fSheridan Road \u2014 a 10\u2011key boutique hotel plus restaurant, ice\u2011cream parlor, event venue and restored carriage\u2011house gardens. That project also emphasizes public access and cultural programming, with Celadon entering a 99\u2011year lease with the local government.\nCeladon also has made a string of other high-profile plays across the region. In\nDeerfield\n, Celadon is investing in a $70 million senior housing project under construction on a former industrial site, and the firm remains active in affordable housing deals throughout the Chicago area.\nNot all of the developer\u2019s recent headlines have been celebratory, though. In September, Celadon and co-developer Blackwood Group sued two former partners over a\ndispute-ridden $184 million office-to-residential conversion\non LaSalle Street in Chicago, claiming defendant Primera Group misled city officials and misappropriated control of the deal. That lawsuit, tied to the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative, underscores the competitive and high-stakes nature of public-private development in Chicago \u2014 especially when incentives and historic assets are in play.\nHenry said Celadon is shooting to start construction on Hotel Florence in early 2027, with a goal of reopening the property in 2028.\nThe project marks an ambitious step for Celadon\u2019s growth across niche redevelopment markets. Whether the Pullman gamble pays off could depend on the same formula it\u2019s banking on in Evanston: high-design hospitality, public buy-in and a splash of cultural cachet.\n",

        "content": "In the Bay Area for most of this year, wealthy homebuyers haven\u2019t been feeling the heat of the slumping regional housing market.\nWhile buyers across San Francisco and Silicon Valley deal with high mortgage rates and equally high prices, many buyers in wealthy enclaves like Atherton and Woodside have been able to juice the local market, often in all-cash offers, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe median sales price of a home in the top 5 percent of home prices in the San Francisco metro area, defined by Redfin as the city plus San Mateo County, was about $6.4 million from August to October, according to a new Redfin\nreport\ncited by the Chronicle. That makes it far and away the highest of the 50 most populous metro areas in the U.S. and reflects a 5 percent rise from the same period last year. The San Jose metro area, with the country\u2019s second-highest median luxury sales price at $5.6 million, saw an increase of nearly 12 percent.\nAt the same time, the median price of a mid-cost home in the Bay Area fell by 1 percent to $1.5 million. The influx of high-ticket buyers working in the tech and burgeoning artificial intelligence sectors has helped luxury home prices skyrocket in enclaves like Portola Valley, Atherton and Woodside, as well as San Francisco itself, as competition over luxe homes leads sellers to increase prices.\n\u201cThe tech wealth effect is putting real liquidity into the hands of local buyers,\u201d Arrian Binnings, an agent with Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, told the Chronicle. \u201cAfter such an epic run-up, many are taking some chips off the table and rotating those funds into local real estate.\u201d\nIn San Francisco, demand for luxury homes is so high that it\u2019s actually led to a\nshortage of mansions\nfor well-to-do buyers looking to pick up some property. Sales for high-end homes are up 14 percent year-over-year, while inventory is down about 4.5 percent.\nIn the past two months alone, several properties in pricey Peninsula cities have traded hands.\nLast month, the Villa del Prato estate in Portola Valley\nsold for $56 million\nto venture capital investor Bandel Carano. In August, investor Marc Andreessen\nsold his Atherton estate\nfor $27 million. And in September, the historic 74-acre Green Gables estate\nset a Bay Area sales price record\nfor the year in an $85 million transaction.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Five-inch or six-inch?\nNow, having recently read \u201cWhy Nothing Works\u201d and \u201cAbundance,\u201d I constantly see examples of the government slowing down projects. The latest was another delay in the\nBrooklyn Marine Terminal\nmegadevelopment.\nIt was portrayed not as a setback, but as something to celebrate. And it was caused not by opponents of the plan, but by its alleged supporters.\n\u201cWe are proud to share that the Environmental Review scoping comment period has been extended to March 31, 2026!\u201d Council member Shahana Hanif wrote in her newsletter. \u201cThis comes after sustained advocacy from community members and elected officials.

Really?\nThe extensions also mean more time will be needed to review all the comments. (I\u2019ll make my comment short: There\u2019s a housing emergency. Build the damn project!)\nMost of this year was\nalready wasted\nwaiting for a 28-member task force to reach a consensus on what to build. That was like herding cats.\nThe way things are going, everyone who files comments will have died or retired to Florida by the time the Brooklyn Marine Terminal redevelopment is finished. If it ever is.\nComment periods that last six or nine months are one of many efficiency-killers. Hanif\u2019s Oct. 10 letter reveals more of the convoluted process that such projects must endure.\nBelow, note the dizzying array of acronyms and time-consuming reviews casually mentioned in her letter, which also requests another community meeting. Hanif describes this gauntlet as if it is\nnormal\n\u2014 which, for politicians, it is. They have never done private-sector development, where time is money and delays can kill a project.\n\u201cBefore any scoping meetings take place, NYCEDC and MOEC should host a public presentation of the full plan, including a Q&amp;A, so community members can understand what will be evaluated in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Holding these hearings before residents have had the opportunity to review and ask questions about the final vision plan prevents substantive input and undermines the CEQR process.\u201d\nEDC, MOEC, EIS, CEQR \u2026 But wait, there\u2019s more!\n\u201cAdditionally, the proposed dates for the Draft Scope of Work (DSOW) hearings, both October 28 (in-person) and October 30 (virtual) fall during a particularly difficult and symbolic time. Residents are still recovering from the recent\nRed Hook fire\n, and the dates coincide with the anniversary of Superstorm Sandy (October 29), a day of remembrance and reflection across our waterfront communities.\u201d\nSuperstorm Sandy remembrance? What in holy hell is she talking about?\nSandy caused tremendous damage, to be sure, and a few Brooklynites lost their lives. But the storm was 13 years ago. The idea that we should extend a comment period in 2025 to pause for \u201cremembrance and reflection\u201d of Sandy is preposterous.\nHanif\u2019s staff must have had a brainstorming session to think of the most absurd reasons to stall the Marine Terminal project.\n\u201cHey, everyone, there\u2019s\na comet\npassing by Earth. We need to extend the comment period!\u201d\nHer letter went on to complain that the project\u2019s October community meetings were too close to the election, making the schedule \u201cinequitable and exclusionary.\u201d\nWho\u2019s being excluded? People who couldn\u2019t spare an hour because they were door-knocking for Zohran Mamdani?\nLiberal thought leaders are begging their elected officials to speed up the government before every last American loses faith in its ability to do anything. When \u201cAbundance\u201d reached No. 1 on the bestseller list, it gave me hope.\nBut everywhere I look, I see the same things happening. It\u2019s nothing to be proud of.\n",

        "content": "Allen Morris Company secured a $138.5 million construction loan for its mixed-use Ziggurat development in\nCoconut Grove\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nCoral Gables-based\nAllen Morris\nand its partner, the Espinosa family that owns the property at 3101 Grand Avenue, secured the financing from BDT &amp; MSD Partners and BHI, the U.S. arm of Israel-based Bank Hapoalim, according to a release.\nThe planned Ziggurat development is expected to include a five-story, 100,000-square-foot office building and a three-story, 18-unit luxury condo building with about 45,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The office building will also have a rooftop restaurant and lounge by a Michelin-starred chef, the release states.\nAllen Morris, led by its namesake Chairman and CEO W. Allen Morris and President\nSpencer Morris\n, revealed\nthe project plans\nabout a year ago. Morris said the mixed-use nature of the building was \u201ccompelling\u201d to lenders.\n\u201cThis is one of the top three submarkets in South Florida, including West Palm Beach, for office,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThis would have secured construction financing even without the other components. The demand and supply drivers are there.\u201d\nLotus Capital Partners, led by Faisal Ashraf, arranged the financing.\nConstruction is expected to begin this month and could be completed in 2028. Morris said crews will be digging the foundation early next year.\nThe 1.7-acre property, at the intersection of Grand Avenue, Matilda Street and Florida Avenue, is home to the Espinosa family\u2019s Coconut Grove Dry Cleaners and other small businesses, including Sapore di Mare. The Italian restaurant plans to move to another location in Coconut Grove.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is leading sales of the condos, with prices ranging from $3.5 million to $15 million. The units will range from 1,250 square feet to more than 5,000 square feet. The condo building will overlook the city\u2019s Kirk Munroe Park. An experiential sales center is expected to open soon across the street, as part of a collaboration with Chevre Miami, a gourmet market, cheesemonger and wine shop, which will operate a cafe. The Miami City Commission is set to vote next week on a development agreement with Allen Morris Co. to renovate Kirk Munroe Park and Fuller Street.\nThe condo component is more than 50 percent sold, Morris said. Buyers at Ziggurat are \u201cmore international,\u201d and many plan to use their condos as pied-\u00e0-terres. Morris said he\u2019s buying a unit at the project.\nChad Oppenheim\u2019s Oppenheim Architecture is designing Ziggurat, which is expected to include paseos that lead to a central courtyard.\nDaniel Cardenas and Michael Sullivan with Vertical Real Estate are leading retail leasing. It\u2019s about 40 to 45 percent leased, Morris said. Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Ryan Holtzman, Andrew Trench and Brian Gale are handling office leasing with Thad Adams of the Allen Morris Co.\nAllen Morris plans to relocate its headquarters to the new building, joining other developers who are headquartered in the popular Miami neighborhood. Related Group,\nTerra\n,\nMast Capital\n, Swerdlow Group and others are based in Coconut Grove.\nNear Ziggurat, the family of the late Isaac Kodsi is\ncompleting Arbor Residences\n, a condo project that Kodsi acquired out of foreclosure in 2023. The 45-unit building at 3034 Oak Avenue is about a block away from the Ziggurat site. Both are in downtown Coconut Grove, near CocoWalk.\n",

Its lease runs until the end of 2033, according to the release.\nIn addition to Park House, the building at 4411 San Felipe is also home to Ciel Restaurant, as well as an outpost of wellness company Fountain Life and Advancial Federal Credit Union.\nHouston-based DC Partners\ndeveloped the property in 2023.\nThe building is at the edge of Houston\u2019s prestigious River Oaks neighborhood and offers easy access to Loop 610 as well as The Galleria and Uptown. River Oaks routinely produces the city\u2019s\nmost expensive residential listings\n. It will also soon be home to a highly anticipated 17-acre mixed-use development from Transwestern. Plans for\nThe RO\ninclude an Auberge Collection hotel and condo tower called The Bridsall. Construction is underway on the project at West Alabama Street and Buffalo Speedway. The project will also include a luxury apartment complex and high-end retail.\nPark House also operates a Dallas site in Highland Park Village, the high-end retail center owned by\nRay Washburne\n. Park House was founded by Megan and Brady Wood and Deborah and John Scott. The Woods are owners of WoodHouse; John Scott is a former CEO of Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts.

        "content": "The Hamptons\u2019 luxury market was on fire in 2025.\nFollowing a lull in top-dollar deals last year, the East End\u2019s highest tier snapped back to life, crowned by its first nine-figure deal since 2023. The surge pushed the year\u2019s top 10 residential closings to a combined $579 million, up significantly from\n$327 million in 2024\nand even outpacing the $550 million logged in 2022.\nThe momentum extended beyond the priciest deals. Between January and October, 20 homes in the Hamptons sold for $20 million or more, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. By late fall, the luxury destination was on track to notch more than 90 deals totaling $10 million or more, up from 75 in 2024 and just 41 in 2023.\nAs the Hamptons\u2019 residential market began heating up ahead of the summer, appraiser and analyst Jonathan Miller noted that more homes were hitting the market in the South Fork, allowing\nmore deals to cross the finish line\n. That, along with a banner Wall Street bonus season, fueled the uptick in activity.\nAside from the eye-popping price tags, this year\u2019s leading deals also featured a number of high-profile buyers and sellers. Access Industries\u2019 Len Blavatnik clinched the No. 1 spot in the rankings, with Boston Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck, Shutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer and Swedish billionaire Thomas Sandell also in the mix.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the deals defining the Hamptons\u2019 rebound year:\n1)\n408 Further Lane, Amagansett | $115 million\nDeveloper Len Blavatnik set a new record for a single parcel deal in the Hamptons when he dropped\n$115 million\non an eight-and-a-halfacre property in July, marking the first nine-figure deal in the luxury enclave in two years.\nAn entity tied to the Ukraine-born founder of Access Industries bought the oceanfront estate from Terry Semel, the former chairman of Warner Bros. and Yahoo!. Semel in 2005 paid $43 million for the property, which at the time included a five-bedroom cottage.\n2)\n370 &amp; 372 Further Lane, East Hampton | $70 million\nThe\n$70 million deal\nfor the seven-acre, oceanfront property managed to land the No. 2 spot, despite selling for a significant discount. The buyer, whose identity is shielded by an LLC, purchased the estate in April for $19 million off of its initial asking price when it hit the market last summer.\nThe property includes a 10,000-square-foot main house at 372 Further Lane, which features a terrace with an outdoor fireplace, heated pool and three-car garage, as well as a smaller guest house on the neighboring lot.\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Frank Newbold represented the seller, and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Paul Brennan and Martha Gundersen brought the buyer.\n3)\n105 &amp; 111 Lily Pond Lane, East Hampton | $67 million\nAn LLC linked to the estate of Polly Buckmann, who was married to investment banker Donald Buckmann, traded the two properties in September for\n$66.8 million\n. The deal included an 8,400-square-foot waterfront home at 105 Lily Pond Lane, which includes 11 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, as well as a 1.85-acre lot next door.\nThe estate, known as Dune House, asked just under $80 million when it\nhit the market\nin April. The home was built in 1916 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s treasury secretary, William H. Woodin.\nCompass\u2019 Ed Petrie, James Petrie and Charles Forsman had the listing, and The Agency\u2019s Dana Trotter brought the buyer.\n4)\n165 Surfside Drive, Bridgehampton | $58 million\nCo-owner of the Boston Celtics, Wyc Grousbeck, and his wife, Emilia Fazzalari, paid\n$58 million\nin November for the oceanfront home developed by Joe Farrell.\nThe 1.24-acre property includes an eight-bedroom mansion \u2014 complete with a 4,400-square-foot rooftop terrace \u2014 pool and six-car garage. Farrell initially sought $70 million for the property before he completed construction on the home.\nCompass\u2019 Richard Steinberg and Hedgerow Exclusive Properties\u2019 Greg Gould and Dominic Couzens represented Grousbeck in the deal.\n5)\n125 Mid Ocean Drive, Bridgehampton | $57 million\nShutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer in October offloaded his oceanfront mansion to an unknown buyer in a\n$57 million off-market deal\n. The 10,300-square-foot home has eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms and features a heated infinity pool, outdoor kitchen and gym.\nOringer bought the estate in 2014 for $40 million. He initially tried to sell the property for $52 million in 2021, after he moved to Florida, though he pulled it off the market before finding a buyer.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Erica Grossman, Paul Brennan and Martha Gundersen represented Oringer, while Compass\u2019 Terry Cohen brought the buyer.\n6)\n1010 Meadow Lane, Southampton | $56 million\nThe home at 1010 Meadow Lane appears to have traded in an off-market deal, which closed for $55.8 million in September. The seller is Nancy Silverman, who was married to private equity executive and founder of 54 Madison Partners, Henry Silverman, until their divorce in 2012.\nThe now-estranged couple bought the property for $11.8 million in 2001, though Nancy appears to have taken over ownership of the property during their divorce, according to property records. At the time, the 2.2-acre property featured a five-bedroom, five-bathroom home, according to Realtor.com.\n7)\n294 Further Lane, East Hampton | $49 million\nThe home at 294 Further Lane sold for $48.5 million in June in what also appears to be an off-market deal. The identities of both the buyers and sellers are shielded behind anonymous entities.\nThe property last traded in 2004, when Jonathan Rosenstein, founder and managing partner of Trilogy Capital Group bought it for $4.8 million, according to property records.\n8)\n1320 Meadow Lane, Southampton | $40 million\nSwedish billionaire Thomas Sandell finally sold his unfinished mansion for $40 million in March, seven years after he initially sought to offload it. The buyer\nsigned a contract\nfor the property last December.\nSandell bought the waterfront property from the family of Calliope Kulukindis, the widow of a Greek shipping mogul, for $37 million in 2007. He spent another $19 million on constructing a Moroccan-style mansion, though he abandoned work in 2018 when the home was about 60 percent complete.\nCorcoran\u2019s Tim Davis and Bespoke Real Estate had the listing.\n9)\n24 &amp; 36 Jefferys Lane, East Hampton | $36 million\nThe four-acre, waterfront estate traded in November for $36.3 million, seven months after hitting the market for just under $42 million, according to a listing with Realtor.com.\nThe property features a 7,900-square-foot home at 24 Jefferys Lane, which was built in 1815 and moved to the site in 1923, and a neighboring lot, which is currently vacant.\n10)\n1730 Meadow Lane, Southampton &amp; 67 Surfside Drive, Bridgehampton\u00a0 | $32 million\nThe two waterfront homes tied for the last spot among the 10 most expensive deals in the Hamptons in 2025, both closing for $32 million.\nThe renovated property at 1730 Meadow Lane, known as Camp Meadow, spans 3.4 acres and features a two-story home with seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms. The other oceanfront property in Bridgehampton was featured as Gordon Gekko\u2019s home in the 1987 film \u201cWall Street.\u201d\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Christopher Covert had the listing for the Southampton home, while Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Harald Grant brought the buyer. Hedgerow Exclusive Properties represented the buyer and seller in the deal for 67 Surfside Drive.",

        "content": "Robert A.M. Stern\ndied last week\nat the age of 86, leaving behind the legacy of a 60-year career designing schools, libraries, museums, and, most notably, condos.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA) built a career out of making new things that feel old. He is best known for his prewar inspired works in New York City, including the Zeckendorfs\u2019\n15 Central Park West\n, Vornado\u2019s\n220 Central Park South\n, Naftali\u2019s\nBellemont\n.\nBut as South Florida\u2019s real estate market boomed in the post-pandemic years, flush with cash from inbound New Yorkers, their favorite architect followed. Stern left behind a pipeline of luxury condo projects in the works across the tri-county region, including some of South Florida\u2019s most expensive new developments.\nThey include $120 million penthouses, private restaurants from Michelin-starred chefs and members clubs.\nWhile they are perhaps the architect\u2019s most high-profile South Florida projects yet, they are not his first. Stern employed an uncharacteristic modernism in designing the Miami Beach Library, which was completed in 2003. He also designed Rafael D\u00edaz-Balart Hall at Florida International University College of Law in 2006. In 2023, Stern designed a single-family home in North Palm Beach\u2019s gated\nLost Tree Village\nneighborhood, for \u201clong time and dear clients,\u201d according to RAMSA\u2019s website.\nHere\u2019s a look at RAMSA-designed developments in the pipeline:\nShore Club Private Collection\nWitkoff Group and Monroe Capital tapped Stern\u2019s RAMSA to design the Shore Club Private Collection, an Auberge Resorts-branded luxury condo and hotel development under construction in Miami Beach, on a strip that developers have branded \u201cbillionaires\u2019 beach.\u201d The project\u2019s design is marked by its signature curves, floor-to-ceiling windows and light materials such as wood and marble.\nShore Club\n, at 1901 Collins Avenue, will include a restored circa-1939 building with 75 hotel rooms, a new 20-story, 49-unit condo building and a 6,000-square-foot single-family beach house. The condos will range from 1,900 square feet to more than 10,000 square feet. The project has been one of the most successful as of late in Miami Beach: A hidden buyer is under contract to pay more than $11,000 per square foot, a total purchase price of $120 million, for the penthouse. That price would set a record for condo sales in Florida.\nOcean Terrace\nAfter hiring RAMSA for the Shore Club, Witkoff tapped the firm to design the interiors of the planned\nOcean Terrace project\nit\u2019s co-developing with Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher\u2019s Ocean Terrace Holdings. Ocean Terrace, planned for the site between 74th and 75th Streets along Collins Avenue and Ocean Terrace in North Beach, will include a 52-unit condo, 24 condo-hotel units, a 42-key luxury hotel in a historic building and a private members\u2019 club.\nSt. Regis Residences, Miami\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group and Integra Investments commissioned RAMSA to design their planned\nSt. Regis Residences, Miami\n, a 50-story, 152-unit tower under construction at 1809 Brickell Avenue. The bayfront Brickell project has a projected sellout of more than $1 billion.\nFirst envisioned as two 46-story towers with 330 units, the developers in 2022 eliminated one tower, reducing the number of units and raising prices. Amenities will include a fitness center, a pickleball court, a private marina, spa facilities and an indoor lap pool, as well as a St. Regis Tea Room and residents-only restaurant by Michelin-starred chef Fabio Trabocchi.\nTyko Capital provided the developers with\n$527 million in construction financing\nlast year.\nSouth Flagler House, West Palm Beach\nRAMSA is the architect for Related Ross\u2019 South Flagler House, the most expensive new development condo project in West Palm Beach. The median price for units in the two-tower, 28-story, 108-unit development at 1355 South Flagler Drive is $15 million.\nPrices start at $7.9 million, and the penthouse is asking $73 million. South Flagler House\u2019s amenities will include a pool, spa, fitness center,\npickleball courts\n, salon,\nprivate dining room\n, catering kitchen, wine tasting room, library, media room, private offices, playroom, dog run and a sculpture garden, according to a brochure for the project.\nIn June, billionaire Related Ross Chairman and CEO Steve Ross\nsecured $600 million in financing\nfor the project, one of the largest residential construction loans in Florida this year. Bank OZK, GoldenTree Asset Management and TZ Capital provided the loan. Construction is expected to finish in 2027.\nCorcoran\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie, who heads sales for South Flagler House, said watching the construction is \u201clike watching sculpture.\u201d\n",

Residents would have access to a central paseo, landscaping and electric vehicle charging facilities.\nIn order to proceed, Taylor Morrison needs approval of a general plan amendment and a zoning change due to existing land regulations at the former school site.\nTaylor Morrison\u2019s endeavor is the latest proposal in Greater Los Angeles to call for replacing shuttered public school campuses with housing.\nIn Pasadena, the Pasadena Unified School District Board of Education is\nadvancing entitlements\nfor a workforce housing development on the site of the former Roosevelt Elementary School at 315 North Pasadena Avenue; the project calls for multiple low-rise structures with a total of 115 residential units. In Duarte, the Duarte Unified School District is\nworking with Crestfield Townhomes\nto redevelop the closed Andres Duarte Arts Academy into 169 three- and four-bedroom townhomes.\nTaylor Morrison is no stranger to the L.A. area.\nIn 2021, the company completed construction of Encore, a community of for-sale homes in\nPlaya Vista\n. That development at 6500 South Seabluff Drive comprises 14 multistory single-family homes, each with its own two-car garage.

Now, it has the site to match.\nJacob Kohn\u2019s firm acquired the lot at 97 West Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood from Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management for $130 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Pearl Realty had owned the site since 2001, when it acquired the lot between Greenpoint Avenue and Milton Street for $7 million.\nNone of the parties involved in the transaction commented to the publication. The sale was disclosed in city records on Monday.\nLast month, the Jay Group\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor a 590-unit rental project on the site, but it was unclear at the time if it actually owned the lot. G4 Capital Partners provided the financing.\nThe Jay Group has been active on the Greenpoint waterfront with help from G4 Capital. The developer acquired 101 Fleet Place in 2021 for $42.8 million and landed a $130 million construction loan from G4. The developer built a 21-story residential tower at the site.\nG4 also provided a $55 million loan to the Jay Group last year to purchase six lots in the same area \u2014 102-110 Fleet Place, 165 Willoughby and 275 Flatbush Extension \u2014 for $75 million. Those lots were also previously connected to Pearl Realty, demonstrating an ongoing relationship between buyer and seller.\nThe neighborhood at the northern tip of Brooklyn was rezoned in 2005, allowing residential construction in an area once overrun by industrial activity.\nElsewhere on West Street,\nTF Cornerstone is planning a 1,000-unit project\nat No. 45.

        "content": "A foreclosure sale that preservationists hoped would deliver a lifeline to one of Chicago\u2019s most distressed Frank Lloyd Wright houses instead handed control back to the lender, dimming prospects for a near-term rescue.\nPHH Mortgage, the Florida-based holder of the J.J. Walser House mortgage, submitted the sole bid \u2014 $240,000 \u2014 at a court-ordered auction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, far above what either of two prepared bidders were willing to pay for the Austin neighborhood house at\n42 North Central Avenue\n.\nWith no competing offers from Austin Coming Together, a neighborhood revitalization group, or developer Andy Schcolnik, who has recently revived two other crumbling Chicago properties, PHH walked away with the deed. The lender has stayed silent about its plans, and preservation advocates say the 1903 Wright design, already in dire condition, now faces at least another winter of deterioration.\n\u201cThe building is crying out for someone to come in and restore it and occupy it,\u201d Barbara Gordon, executive director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy told the outlet. She warned that Chicago\u2019s freeze-thaw cycle alone can wreak havoc on a vacant structure, especially one that has suffered years of neglect.\nThe\nstucco residence\nis noted for its horizontal lines, overhanging eaves and bands of windows \u2014 features that would later define Wright\u2019s signature\nPrairie School\nstyle. It was designed for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser Jr. and has stood vacant since 2019.\nAustin Coming Together hoped to turn the Walser House into a companion piece to the $40.8 million\nAspire Center\nredevelopment across the street, part of a broader push to stabilize Central Avenue.\nBut the $240,000 bid was too high, according to the group\u2019s executive director, Darnell Shields. The\nhome\nis appraised at roughly $65,000, and Shields estimated a full restoration would run at least $2 million.\nSchcolnik voiced similar frustration, saying PHH showed no interest in working with prospective rehabbers. He recently acquired a vacant Bronzeville mansion and intended to pursue a similar turnaround for the Wright property. Both he and Shields declined to disclose their planned bids, though both made clear the lender overshot the market for a house in unlivable condition.\nValues in Austin underscore the challenge. Over the past year, the average sale price of single-family homes was about $280,000, according to Midwest Real Estate Data, with move-in-ready homes dominating the higher end. Houses requiring significant rehab generally traded under $100,000 \u2014 a sad valuation for a landmarked structure saddled with code violations, mortgage complexity and extensive deferred maintenance.\nWhat PHH does next remains unclear. Landmark protections bar demolition by neglect, and the city is already pursuing the owners in housing court. The Teague family, which owned the home since 1969, became entangled in a reverse-mortgage tangle after Anne Teague drew on the property\u2019s equity in the late 1990s. The amount now owed is murky, and the mortgage has changed hands multiple times.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Peak\u2019s properties, however, didn\u2019t warrant \u201csubstantial rehabilitation,\u201d according to the agencies\u2019 investigation.\nPeak allegedly tried covering its tracks by reassigning apartment numbers to make it harder to track where regulations should\u2019ve been in place, according to the lawsuit. The company also allegedly had a consultant draft false affidavits about the quality of the buildings\u2019 systems.\nThe plaintiffs are seeking a return of the overcharged rents, in addition to damages, though no amount is specified in the lawsuit. They also want an independent administrator to audit the company\u2019s real estate portfolio.\nPeak could not be reached by\nThe Real Deal\nfor comment.\nThe landlord is part of Balanced Housing Solutions, which is pushing against the very same rules at the heart of the lawsuit against Peak.\nLast week, Balanced Housing Solutions\nsued\nNew York\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal over alleged unlawful retroactive application of new rules concerning \u201csubstantial rehabilitations\u201d at rent-stabilized properties.\nThe lawsuit argues that HCR is trying to enforce new rules on projects completed before a November 2023 rule change.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\napproved\nthe\nmeasure\n, but with key changes, including striking the retroactive nature of the bill; the new application rule applies to substantial renovations initiated on or after January 1, 2024. Owners, from that point on, would need to submit applications within one year of completing a substantial rehab to legally deregulate the building.\nBalanced Housing Solutions, which renovated 31 buildings that were at least 80 percent vacant \u2014 which matches the building count in the state\u2019s lawsuit against Peak \u2014 is seeking an injunction to stop HCR from applying the new rules retroactively.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The plans call for 700 market-rate units as well as a 10,000-square-foot building for either retail or restaurant use.\nIn exchange for its approval, Irvine Company is on the hook to build up to 49 units of affordable housing at an off-site location in the future, a total that equates to 7 percent of the market-rate units at the project near the airport. The market-rate units are set to rise in two five-story residential buildings. The site is currently home to an office park bordered by MacArthur Boulevard, Campus Drive, MacArthur Court and Birch Street.\nIn addition to the affordable units, Irvine Company must provide public benefits including nearly $3.3 million to help revitalize MacArthur Boulevard and a $17,000 fee for any unit that is issued a building permit on or after July 1, 2028. The first building permit for\noff-site affordable housing\n, meanwhile, would have to be issued by Jan. 31, 2029.\nSome residents, however, are skeptical that Irvine Company will follow through with its pledge to build affordable units, even in another location, as the company would be able to pay the in-lieu fee of about $37,000 if it doesn\u2019t build the affordable housing or set aside land to the city for them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to achieve the city\u2019s housing plan with the number of affordable units at a 7 percent rate,\u201d Ron Rubino, vice president of the Eastbluff Homeowners Community Association, told council members. \u201cIt seems like they should be built at the time you approve this kind of development agreement\u201d with conditions that mean the developer \u201dcan\u2019t buy out of it.\u201d\nIn order for the plan to advance, the Newport Beach Planning Commission must look over a site\u2019s development review, traffic study and other entitlements before building permits are issued.

        "content": "Developers for one of the flagship LaSalle Street office-to-resi conversions want another dose of public support to get their deal across the finish line.\nA joint venture of Golub and Corebridge Financial is asking the city to grant a Class L property tax incentive for the 44-story building at 30 North LaSalle Street, adding a roughly $47 million abatement to a project already in line for $57 million in tax increment financing, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The request heads to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks this week, where officials will also weigh landmark status for the 51-year-old tower \u2014 a prerequisite for the incentive.\nIf approved, the tax break would further bolster the team\u2019s $135 million plan to turn the building\u2019s lower half into\n349 apartments\n, including a required 30 percent set aside as affordable for residents earning about 60 percent of area median income. Golub and Corebridge are among six development groups tapped under the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative, a bid to jolt life back into the Loop\u2019s most hollowed-out corridor by underwriting big conversions in buildings whose office prospects have dimmed post-pandemic.\nThe size of the requested abatement demonstrates just how costly it is to refashion midcentury towers that were never meant to house apartments. It could also signal how dependent the initiative is on layered subsidies. City officials are poised to pump $317 million in TIF into the broader slate of projects under the initiative that\u2019s promising around 1,800 units, more than 530 of them affordable. For the tower at\n30 North LaSalle\n, the Class L designation alone would slash the property\u2019s tax bill for 12 years, though planners estimate the revamped building will still generate about $6 million more in taxes over that span than it would if left as outdated office space.\nThe unusually large price tag for the incentive reflects the fact that nearly half the building is staying commercial. In Cook County, offices are taxed more heavily than apartments, so the program\u2019s reduction makes a far bigger dent than Class L awards recently approved for 135 South LaSalle Street and\n111 West Monroe Street\n.\nCorebridge\ngrabbed control of the property in 2023 after foreclosing on the previous owner, and the partners have told the city they plan to finance the redevelopment with a mix of $25 million in equity, $51 million in debt and historic tax credit proceeds.\nThose credits lean on the building\u2019s architecture and history: The city\u2019s planning department issued a report characterizing the tower, designed by Dallas-based architect Thomas E. Stanley II, as an International Style tower with touches of New Formalism built on the controversial demolition site of Louis Sullivan\u2019s Old Stock Exchange.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s convention center business is on ice until 2029, but local tourism officials are getting creative to keep heads in beds while the city\u2019s downtown anchor is rebuilt.\nThe old Austin Convention Center closed earlier this year and has already been razed. Work is underway on a larger venue with 70 percent more rentable space, though it won\u2019t be ready for the crucial spring festival season for another five years. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the missing center is already\ndenting hotel performance\n, with double-digit, year-over-year revenue drops for many downtown properties. In prior years, group and business travelers could make up nearly half of bookings at some hotels, leaving a noticeable gap during the long\nconstruction window\n.\nTo plug it, Visit Austin is rolling out a huge, multifaceted marketing push. The new Tourism Public Improvement District \u2014 a\n2 percent nightly fee\non most hotel rooms \u2014 is expected to generate almost $30 million next year, funding incentives, sales support and aggressive marketing meant to counterbalance the convention void.\nThirty percent of the pot is earmarked for advertising, and another 30 percent for sales strategies, while 20 percent is set aside for convention-related incentives despite the center\u2019s closure.\nThe spending campaign is expected to help the agency shift from seasonal ads to year-round campaigns in more markets, pitching Austin as a meeting-friendly \u201ccampus\u201d instead of a single-site hub. Visit Austin leaders told the outlet that the city still offers deep event capacity between downtown hotels, unexpected venues and distributed meeting space. They\u2019ve leaned into a strategy of \u201cmini-wide\u201d bookings \u2014 spreading conferences across multiple properties \u2014 and have already secured 37 such events for 2026 to 2028.\nLeisure travel is getting a heavier lift too. TPID dollars are helping the agency expand advertising in both drive and fly markets, including new pushes in Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Monterrey, Mexico. Mexican travelers have become a particular priority, with early returns strong, as Austin gains visibility as an alternative to\nDallas\n, Houston and San Antonio.\nVisit Austin is also trying to regain digital visibility after noticing traffic losses tied to the rise of AI trip planning. It launched a redesigned website this fall tailored to both human visitors and generative AI, aiming to make website information more accessible and visible to AI searches.\nTourism officials say early indicators point toward a steadier 2026, bolstered by ACL Fest, a strong SXSW outlook and expected spillover from World Cup matches in nearby host cities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

They\u2019re ending it with a nine-figure financing package for the\nhistoric office-to-residential conversion\n.\nApollo and GIC provided an $835 million debt package to refinance the 1,320-unit building in the Financial District, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Leasing began at the former 1.1 million-square-foot office property \u2014 dubbed SoMA for South Manhattan \u2014 in the last days of January and move-ins began the following month.\nA Newmark team including Jordan Roeschlaub, Chris Kramer and John Caraviello negotiated the debt.\nThe last major financing at the property came three years ago, when Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Partners and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance provided\na $536 million loan\nfor the acquisition and redevelopment of the building.\nAt the time, the loan was the largest for an office-to-residential conversion in United States history, according to Real Capital Analytics data shared by Newmark.\nBefore the conversion, the 22-story property long served as back offices for JPMorgan. The bank, however, pursued a sublease for a substantial portion of its 700,000 square feet as it prepared to move to its\nnew headquarters at 270 Park Avenue\n.\nThe developers proceeded to embark on one of the largest office-to-residential conversions in the country\u2019s history. In addition to the high unit count, the building also features 100,000 square feet of community amenities, including both rooftop and indoor pools, a spa, a bowling alley, a game room with sports simulators and coworking space.\nThe developers are also seeking a tax abatement under the\n467m conversion program\nsince a portion of the units were set aside for affordable housing.\nThere are a handful of units available on the property\u2019s\nwebsite\n, ranging from net effective rents of $3,500 to more than $10,000; layouts range from studios to four-bedroom apartments.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Nvidia started leasing the building late last year.\nThe 97,800-square-foot building is in the midst of a makeover, including a renovation of the structure\u2019s exterior that has been underway for several months. The development of the data center itself is slated to begin in December of next year and wrap up by July 2027.

Menlo Equities offloaded the twin buildings next to Levi\u2019s Stadium. In August, Vancouver, Canada-based Westbank saw the writing on the wall with regard to the Bay Area\u2019s office vacancy and opted to file new plans for\nhousing and a data center\nrather than offices at 180 Park Avenue in downtown San Jose.\nNvidia, meanwhile, has been growing alongside the AI sector as more companies commit to using its chips in their processing. The company in September\ndropped $83.2 million\non another Silicon Valley office for a 125,000-square-foot building in Santa Clara. And last month, it demonstrated its commitment to the region by inking its\nfirst-ever lease in San Francisco\n, grabbing 45,000 square feet of offices at Mission Rock.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Cannon Hill Capital Partners is doubling down on its office conviction, striking a partnership with TriPost Capital Partners to scoop up distressed assets across the Northeast corridor.\nThe firms are aiming high, eyeing deal sizes above $50 million and have as much as $1.5 billion in buying power for office properties, non-performing loans and rescue capital, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The venture marks Cannon Hill\u2019s first formal tie-up with TriPost.\nCannon Hill \u2014 founded by Normandy and Columbia Property Trust alums Jeff Gronning, Melissa Donohoe and Eric Rubin \u2014 and TriPost plan to focus on New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., markets the Cannon Hill team knows intimately from decades of investing and the 10 million square feet currently under management.\nNew York is leading the office recovery, Rubin said, but D.C. and Boston offer pockets of opportunity.\nIn Washington, government sluggishness continues to dampen demand, yet private-sector tenants, particularly law firms, are showing signs of life. Boston, meanwhile, is dealing with tenant churn, but its smaller office footprint compared to larger markets could create select outsized opportunities, or at least that\u2019s what Cannon Hill and TriPost have in mind.\nBoth sides say the timing is right for the partnership after years where office buying couldn\u2019t pencil out. Liquidity is creeping back, lenders are tiptoeing into the sector again and leasing volumes in New York have rebounded to pre-Covid levels.\nDistress will be the core theme of the partnership, which will target both underwater owners willing to cooperate with lenders on discounted sales and banks eager to unload non-performing loans, Gronning said.\nWith roughly $500 billion in office loans maturing by 2028, per MSCI, the firms expect a multi-year runway to assemble a six-to-eight asset portfolio positioned for a short hold and, they hope, outsized returns.\nCannon Hill has already dipped back into the sector, partnering with TPG and Global Holdings on deals at 101 Franklin Street and\n888 Broadway\n. The TriPost partnership is designed to scale that strategy, leveraging Cannon Hill\u2019s vertically integrated platform and its team\u2019s comfort underwriting everything from Class C rehabs to trophy repositionings.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miami Dade College\u2019s board of trustees doubled down on its controversial plan to hand over a prime downtown parcel for Donald Trump\u2019s $950 million presidential library.\nThe board unanimously reapproved the land transfer on Tuesday at a packed morning meeting in Hialeah, the\nMiami Herald\nreported.\nThe redo vote resulted from a pending lawsuit alleging the college violated Florida\u2019s public meeting laws by not adequately advertising the first time the board voted on the deal in September.\nThe complaint, filed by Miami activist and historian\nMarvin Dunn\n, accused the board of quietly advancing the land transfer with no public debate and minimal disclosure about how the deal came to fruition. The site is a 2.6-acre college employee parking lot at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n, adjacent to the historic Freedom Tower in downtown Miami.\nNearly 100 residents, activists, students and political figures turned out for the second vote, sharply splitting between supporters who framed the project as an economic win, and critics who blasted it as a \u201cland giveaway\u201d to a foundation run by the 47th president\u2019s family members.\nDunn said he plans to press ahead with his lawsuit despite Tuesday\u2019s outcome.\nThe board voted to transfer the land to the state of Florida.\nPreviously,\nGov. Ron DeSantis\nand the Florida Cabinet voted to give the 2.6 acres to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation, which is led by Eric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of daughter Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley. The governor and the cabinet members are expected to hold their own redo vote as well.\nThe foundation is planning a high-rise complex that includes the library and a residential tower. The pitch stands in stark contrast to a 2016 request for proposals on the same property, when the college sought at least $20 million in cash plus a student-serving cultural center and other commitments. That effort fizzled, and the lot remained undeveloped.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge\nMavel Ruiz\nruled in Dunn\u2019s favor, prohibiting the college from transferring the deed while the case went to trial in August. But the judge signaled that a new, properly noticed vote could clear the way for the deal.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

The\nreport\nincludes re-lists in its new listings roundup.\nBeverly Hills Estates founders\nBranden and Rayni Williams\nare the listing agents; they developed the property in partnership with design firm Scott Mitchell Studio.\nThe high-end agents reportedly paid actor Jeremy Renner $8 million for the land at 7661 Curson Terrace in 2015 and placed the completed spec home on the market in September for $125 million. Last week, it briefly went off the market but later returned to make it the priciest listing to emerge during the seven-day period ended Nov. 30, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\ncompiled by Marcy Roth.\nThe brokerage said the relist was on account of updated photos for the residence.\nThe sprawling estate comes in at 22,000 square feet with seven beds and 12 baths. It sits on a secluded lot with no neighbors to the left or right of the home. Among the amenities are a motor court that can fit at least a dozen cars, screening room, billiards room and private access to Runyon Canyon.\nThe home, not including the land, penciled out to $3,500 per square foot in construction costs, the listing said.\nElsewhere in Los Angeles County, the Eklund Gomes team reported eight properties falling into contract last week, which amounted to $68.8 million in asking volume. That\u2019s down from 15 contracts totaling $133.2 million in the year-ago period.\nThe Eklund Gomes report counts homes listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nLast week\u2019s top home to go into contract was 701 North Beverly Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats, which is listed for $19.8 million, or $2,052 per square foot.\nThe six-bed, nine-bath home is over 9,600 square feet and is listed by Compass\u2019 Michael Libow.\nThe seller is Brantley Capital Ltd., which has a British Virgin Islands address, according to records found in PropertyShark.\nThe three-level home\u2019s primary suite comes with its own sitting room and fireplace. There\u2019s also a gated driveway, two-story foyer in the entry, BBQ area outdoors and media room.\nEven with last week\u2019s year-over-year decline in signed contracts, actual residential closings of homes listed for $4 million or more were up in the third quarter.\nThe number of deals rose 21 percent to 497 transactions in the quarter, compared to a year ago, according to MLS data compiled by Westside Estate Agency. Meanwhile, sales volume jumped about 25 percent in the quarter to $784.4 million.\nThe median closing price ticked up roughly 2 percent to $5.5 million compared to a year earlier.\n",

        "content": "Hireology is decamping for downtown Chicago\u2019s Marshall Field building, marking a clean win for Brookfield Properties as it works to stabilize one of the Loop\u2019s most ambitious office conversions.\nThe HR software firm signed a lease for just under 31,000 square feet on the eighth floor at 24 East Washington Street and will relocate next month from 303 East Wacker Drive, where its lease expires in January. The move, first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s, lands another tenant in the six-story block of offices\nBrookfield\ncarved out above Macy\u2019s State Street flagship.\nLeasing has been steady but sporadic since the redevelopment debuted, and the building has been in a relative lull the past two years. Hireology joins\nOlam International\n, Numerator and Vivid Seats,\namong others\n, bringing the roughly 650,000-square-foot office component closer to full. It\u2019s about 73 percent leased today, excluding the new deal.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Ari Klein, Scott Shelbourne and Jeff Skender represented Hireology. Jack O\u2019Brien and JD Parcheta handle leasing for the 24 East Washington Street building.\nHireology is taking a spec suite in a space prebuilt out by Brookfield to speed up occupancy for office clients seeking plug-and-play workplaces. Companies reluctant to sink time and capital into custom build-outs have gravitated toward these packages, which offer modern finishes and predictable pricing when construction costs keep climbing.\nHireology CEO Adam Robinson framed the relocation as both a move for growth and to ease commuting. With about 100 Chicago area employees now required to be in the office three days a week, he told the outlet that the team needed a more accessible site than Wacker Drive east of Michigan Avenue. Hireology considered cutting its space by as much as 30 percent, but ultimately decided on a near match to allow for customer visits and periodic travel by staff based outside Chicago. Downsizing would have diluted in-office culture and productivity, Robinson told Crain\u2019s.\nThe shift leaves the building at 303 East Wacker with a hole to fill. The 30-story tower was acquired last year at a\nsteep discount\nby a partnership of 601W and David Werner Real Estate Investments, which secured a new mortgage with $30 million earmarked for leasing costs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mecah Ventures\njust secured a rare construction loan for a mixed-use property in downtown San Mateo.\nThe Menlo Park-based firm locked down $35 million in construction financing from private lender Nikols Company for a 45,000-square-foot building at 435 East Third Avenue, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The score comes after Mecah principal Mike Field pitched about 150 lenders before eventually lining up funding.\nMecah Ventures plans to replace a former auto repair shop at the Third Avenue site with new offices and multifamily units near San Mateo\u2019s Caltrain station. The $45 million total development, known as Parallel on Claremont, will rise five levels, with offices taking up most of the space and five multifamily units on the top floor. It would be the smallest of five buildings Mecah Ventures in its downtown San Mateo redevelopment portfolio, though it\u2019s likely to benefit from a tech and artificial intelligence-driven rebound amid a general lack of new office space.\nThe financing comes as regional banks and other lenders largely take a step back from commercial\nconstruction lending\n; investor-driven lenders now make up 30 percent of all construction loans while regional banks\u2019 share has fallen to 25 percent \u2014 well below the long-term average, per MSCI data cited by the Business Journal. As it stands, office construction starts are down almost 20 percent from a year ago, and no new office buildings are under construction anywhere on the Peninsula.\nConstruction could begin in a few weeks once final permits come through, Field said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a Herculean effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to convince lenders now is the time to go forward, and I think they are starting to believe it.\u201d\nAt the same time, Peninsula office leasing increased 76 percent last quarter. The strongest demand was for buildings near\nCaltrain\nstations and other transit hubs. \u201cThe leasing velocity has been really good,\u201d Field said, noting that vacancy in downtown transit-oriented buildings is falling into single digits.\nIn addition to Parallel on Claremont, Mecah is pursuing the construction of another mixed-use development in San Mateo that could become the tallest building in the city. In August, the firm\nfiled formal plans\nto build a 14-story structure at 1 East 4th Avenue consisting of 236 residential units across 174,700 square feet and 119,780 square feet of commercial space.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Along with a working livery operation and a 12,000-square-foot, 24-stall horse barn, the property includes a 5,750-square foot, seven-bedroom, four-bathroom home that rents for $450 to $500 per night and \u201ccomfortably sleeps 25,\u201d the rental site claims.

The top luxury sale one week in August was a\n15-bedroom compound that sleeps 32 people\n.\n",

But unlike Zohran Mamdani\u2019s promised\nrent freeze\n, landlords get a tax credit to make up the difference. Everybody wins.\nActually, only 42 percent win. A ridiculous 58 percent of the 160,000 tenants eligible for a rent freeze\ndo not get one\n. They are not in the program.\nTenants need not be poor to qualify. In 2015, at the request of the de Blasio administration, then-Sen. Diane Savino carried a bill through Albany to make more tenants eligible. Her law raised the household income limit to $50,000.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge after that was raising awareness,\u201d she\ntweeted\non Sunday. \u201cThousands of people still don\u2019t know about the program or their landlords don\u2019t think it applies to them.\u201d\nEven tenants who know about the program cannot navigate the process. Some landlords help their tenants apply. There\u2019s also a\nhelpline for tenants\n.\nBut the core problem is that applications for city and state programs are notoriously difficult to complete, especially for the targeted recipients \u2014 in this case, seniors and disabled people. Even those who succeed in this task lose the benefit if they fail to renew it.\nTwo city officials recently\nwrote an op-ed\nin City Limits to get more people to sign up. That was a good deed, but unfortunately the authors\ndidn\u2019t explain\nwhy more people don\u2019t know about the program or why the process can\u2019t be simplified \u2014 or even automated.\nThe city and state could use information from individual tax returns, apartment registration data and property tax records to pre-fill applications and mail them out to be signed and returned. Landlords could get notices of potentially eligible tenants.\nThese benefits are worth struggling for, but no one should have to.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre the\n70 bribery convictions\nof NYCHA employees an indictment of the public housing model, or are private landlords and property managers similarly vulnerable to employees\u2019 taking kickbacks from the contractors they select for jobs? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Ray Wohlfarth has written 14 books about boilers. Every time I see\none of his \u201cBoiler Room Detective\u201d videos\n, I think about the old-time boiler mavens and how much expertise will be lost when they are gone. Most of them already are.\nThis matters most in cities like New York, where many heating systems are much older than the people servicing them. Reading and hearing Wohlfarth\u2019s stories, I get the feeling that many steam or hot-water heating systems have been \u201cfixed\u201d over the years by people who didn\u2019t understand them well, causing more problems down the road.\nElsewhere\u2026\nMr. Pink is in the black.\nSteve Buscemi, the actor who played a bank robber by that name in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d sold his row house in Park Slope for a dollar short of $5 million. He and his late wife, the filmmaker and choreographer\nJo Andres\n, had paid $579,000 in 1997, leaving him with a capital gain of about $4.2 million, less the cost of any significant improvements he made to the property.\nBuscemi told the\nNew York Times\nearlier this year that the townhouse is \u201cnot right for me anymore, you know? It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s too big.\u201d The actor and his new wife, Karen Ho, have\nmoved to Manhattan\n.\nIn calculating the tax on the long-term capital gain on a principal residence, a couple can exclude $500,000 of the gain. That would still leave Buscemi and Ho with a hefty tax bill, unless they do a 1031 exchange by quickly buying a similar property. In that case they could defer the entire gain.\nThe $4,999,999 purchase price was no coincidence. It falls $1 shy of the threshold at which New York City\u2019s\nmansion tax\nrises to 2.25 percent from 1.5 percent.\nThe buyers are a couple from the neighborhood. They moved from an apartment on Third Street. Similarly, Buscemi and Andres had moved from Ninth Street in 1997. Housing economists call this chain of relocations \u201c\nfiltering\n.\u201d\nThe new owners (like Buscemi) each used a revocable trust for the transaction, which means they can eventually pass the row house to heirs without it going through probate. In Brooklyn, that can save a lot of hassle.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$13.3 million\nfor a 2,455-square-foot condominium unit at 220 Central Park South. Deborah Kern of Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$32.6 million\nfor a development site at 1059-1061 2nd Avenue in Sutton Place. An entity tied to John K. Rapp sold the site to Krown Point Capital.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$85 million\nfor a 7,700-square-foot penthouse at 125 Perry Street in the West Village. The pre-war property was converted to a condominium in 2025 by Alf Naman. Jim St. Andr\u00e9 and the Hudson Advisory Team have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 34,545-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use project at 376 East 139th Street in Mott Haven. Kendrick Lam filed the permit on behalf of Morris Yeroushalmi.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

That\u2019s about a third of its $605 million value a decade ago, when Brookfield refinanced. Brookfield defaulted when the loan matured in September 2024, and a receiver was appointed in May.\nTrigild\nis the receiver, and Mount Street is the special servicer.\nA sale would result in a buyer taking control of the property, at 333 South Hope Street, which is only 67 percent leased, according to Green Street.\nBrookfield, Trigild and Mount Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Colliers confirmed it is marketing the debt.\nThis is the latest distressed Brookfield-related offering in Los Angeles.\nEastdil Secured listed a Brookfield mortgage note connected to 333 South Grand Avenue,\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nlast month. That property includes an office building called the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower and a retail asset.\nThe offering memorandum did not include an ask, but a $506 million debt on the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower is in default.\nA $275 million note connected to EY Plaza, another Brookfield-owned tower in the hands of a receiver, is being\nmarketed\nby Colliers, after a $130 million deal to sell it collapsed.\nThat note was anticipated to trade a discount, too. The brokerage called for offers in late-October, but it is unknown if it found a taker.\nBrookfield did find a buyer in June for another downtown office tower. It sold\n601 South Figueroa\nStreet for $210 million to Uncommon Developers, less than the debt tied to the property.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s go-to fiscal referee is raising alarms over Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to pull a record $1 billion from the city\u2019s tax increment finance districts to plug budget holes and help pay for a new teachers contract.\nIn a report released Monday, the local watchdog group Civic Federation said the administration\u2019s revamped surplus declaration process has effectively turned TIF into a stealth property tax, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n, diverting funds meant for reinvestment in struggling neighborhoods to cover operating needs at City Hall and Chicago Public Schools.\nAccording to the watchdog, the shift is both politically convenient and structurally risky.\nSurpluses\nhave spiked from $177 million in 2017 to $712 million this year and are projected to hit $1 billion in 2026. But the group argues that the one-time boost engineered by Johnson \u2014 which sharply limited aldermanic prerogative to stockpile\nTIF\ndollars for pending projects \u2014 can\u2019t be repeated. With many of the city\u2019s 108\nTIF districts\nset to expire beginning in 2030, the revenue well is expected to run dry as budgets across local agencies remain under strain.\nThe report highlights a core tension in the program. TIF was designed to channel growth in property values back into the areas that generated it, typically via infrastructure upgrades or development subsidies. Instead, Chicago has leaned on it to fund day-to-day operations, a move the\nCivic Federation\nsays undercuts the very communities TIF is meant to lift.\nOnce districts expire, their restored assessed value flows back into the tax base. Local governments can then apply existing tax rates to a larger base, producing a permanent levy increase that doesn\u2019t count against statutory caps.\nThat dynamic has fueled fierce pushback inside the City Council. Even allies of the mayor balked at the size of this year\u2019s sweep during budget hearings. Alderman Michelle Harris, who represents a South Side ward that relies heavily on TIF to finance public amenities, warned that a broad sweep would wipe out long promised park, school and library projects.\nAlderman Nicole Lee voiced similar concerns, saying a field house in her ward could lose virtually all of its set-aside funding while waiting on routine cost estimates.\nThe Civic Federation\u2019s broader message is blunt: Chicago can\u2019t rely on TIF surpluses to balance budgets forever.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

His 1941 home isn\u2019t quite as\nold\n, but like print books, it\u2019s part of a market that\u2019s considered\npast its heyday\n. Inventory is piling up,\nhomes are lingering longer on the market\nand\nprice cuts have become common\namong the city\u2019s top luxury sales, especially for sellers who bought their homes after the market\u2019s peak in 2022. Just down the street, a spec mansion at\n2209 Bowman Avenue\nsold after 193 days on the market and a price cut. Another recent top weekly sale, a single-family home with a seller who bought it last year,\nlikely sold at a loss\n.\nFinal sale prices aren\u2019t available, but the home at 2103 Bowman went under contract with an asking price 13 percent higher than it was asking last year. The $300,000 difference is a modest but unusual\nprice bump\nfor a market that\u2019s been in decline.\nThe 3,200-square-foot home has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and a fenced backyard with a detached garage. Moreland Properties agent Monica Painter has the listing.\nThe second most expensive home to go under contract last week is a rare condo sale. Unit 1701 at the Seaholm Residences, a condominium converted from an old power plant at 222 West Avenue, is asking $2.4 million.\n",

        "content": "In the outer boroughs, several asset classes earned top lender dollars in October, including a well-leased industrial campus, ground-up rental buildings and mixed-use developments anchored by major retail.\nIn Brooklyn, industrial and residential projects dominated the leaderboard, with big checks for Acumen Capital\u2019s historic Pfizer complex and Harry Einhorn\u2019s new Greenpoint rental. Lenders also fueled Bogopa\u2019s mixed-use development in Bed-Stuy and Clipper Equity\u2019s Pacific Street residential property.\nIn the Bronx, Simone Development secured fresh financing for a Hutchinson Metro Center building, rounding out a diverse slate of deals as the year winds down.\nHere are October\u2019s top five outer borough loans.\nIndustrial infusion | $125M | Williamsburg\nV\u00e4rde Partners\nprovided a $125 million loan for a South Williamsburg industrial and manufacturing building at 630 Flatbush Avenue owned by Acumen Capital Partners. CBRE arranged the three-year, floating-rate loan. The 7.8-acre property was built in 1849 to house Pfizer\u2019s headquarters. Acumen snapped it up in 2011 for $26 million and repurposed it as flex industrial space. The building is 88 percent leased to tenants in the food, technology, education, media, fashion and nonprofit industries, per V\u00e4rde\u2019s website.\nQuay payday | $94M | Greenpoint\nArgentic Investment Management\nprovided a $94 million loan for Harry Einhorn\u2019s multifamily development at 79 Quay Street in Greenpoint. Brooklyn-based developer Einhorn bought the former warehouse property from Cayuga Capital Management in 2016 for $16 million and recently wrapped up construction on an 11-story, 92,000-square-foot building with 140 rental units and 1,300 square feet of commercial space, per New York YIMBY. Popular Bank provided the $51.5 million construction loan in 2023. Available units start at $3,395 for a studio, according to StreetEasy.\nMyrtle money | $90M | Bedford Stuyvesant\nKeyBank\nprovided a $90 million loan to Bogopa Enterprises for its new mixed-use building at 1100 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford Stuyvesant. Bogopa is a parent company of Food Bazaar Supermarkets and temporarily shut down one of its shops at the site to make way for an 11-story, 233-unit mixed-use development, which includes a 29,000-square-foot Food Bazaar. Centennial Bank provided an $80 million\nconstruction loan\nin 2021. Amenities include a co-working library, indoor parking, a fitness center and roof deck.\nMetro money | $88M | Pelham Bay\nConnectOne Bank\nprovided an $88 million loan for Simone Development\u2019s medical office and academic building at 1200 Waters Place in the eastern Bronx. The fresh financing for the property, part of the massive Hutchinson Metro Center, replaced a $100 million CMBS loan. The building is part of a 42-acre campus that includes more than 1.4 million square feet of Class A office and medical space, as well as retail space, dining, complimentary parking and a 125-room Marriott Residence Inn.\nClipper capital | $85M | Crown Heights\nCitibank and Morgan Stanley\nprovided a $84.5 million loan for Clipper Equity\u2019s multifamily development at 998-1010 Pacific Street in Crown Heights. The fresh financing replaced an $80 million loan from Brookfield Asset Management. David Bistricer\u2019s firm bought the development site in 2019 for $20 million and built a nine-story apartment building with 175 units that was completed in 2022. Amenities include a parking garage, gym, media room and a rooftop terrace.\n",

Those two mega-events are ahead of the Olympics.\nCain Managing Director Larry Green, who helms the One Beverly Hills development, said Graziano\u2019s \u201cleadership, relationships and deep understanding of Los Angeles will be invaluable.\u201d\nOne Beverly Hills has\nsecured\ntenants including Italian fashion house Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Italian food hall Casa Tua Cucina, and Mexican-Japanese fusion restaurant Los Mochis.\n",

        "content": "Unbridled Living is expanding its\nsenior housing\nportfolio with its first Texas purchase.\nThe Louisville, Kentucky-based firm bought The Reserve at North Dallas, a 273-unit senior housing community at 12271 Coit Road, and rebranded it Unbridled Living of Dallas, according to a release from JLL, which represented the buyer.\nThe seller is Orlando, Florida-based\nBridge Investment Group\n. JLL also arranged financing for the purchase, securing an acquisition loan from Arrowmark Partners, it said in the release. The three-year loan offers two 12-month extension options.\nBuilt in 2000, Unbridled Living of Dallas features a game room, wellness center, salon, library, resident lounge and a putting green. The property is about 12 miles north of downtown Dallas. About 94,000 residents aged 65 and older live within a five-mile radius of the facility, the release said.\nThe trade marks Unbridled Living\u2019s second property. It also operates a senior housing community in Columbia, Missouri.\nAs baby boomers age, demand for senior housing has risen. In order to meet upcoming peak demand, supply has to increase by 35,000 to 45,000 units each year, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nHowever, construction starts are the lowest they\u2019ve been since the Great Financial Crisis. Nationwide, occupancy bounced back from its pandemic low and is now steady and growing at 89 percent, the report said.\nTexans age 65 and older make up 14 percent of the population, according to a report from Colliers. This age range is growing faster than any other age group in the Lone Star State, jumping 3.8 percent from 2023 to 2024. The\n65-plus population in Texas\nis expected to represent 24.2 percent of the state\u2019s population within the next decade. About 64,000 senior living units exist throughout Texas, and 2,500 units are under construction.\nDespite the favorable tailwinds for senior housing,\nBlackstone\nwasn\u2019t able to make its investment in the asset class work. The firm is liquidating a $1.8 billion investment in the sector, which led to losses of more than $600 million. Even though Blackstone has faced challenges in senior housing, other firms like Welltower and Sonida Senior Living are pushing forward with bets on the sector.\n",

It also brings attention to the development behind it and Miami Beach\u2019s most consistent selling point: the beach itself.\nAcross Miami and Miami Beach, developers and brokerages are\ntaking advantage\nof the influx of art week attendees with special events, sponsorships and open houses. A number of firms and agents put out their own guides to the weeklong event, which includes Art Basel, Art Miami and dozens of other fairs.\nIt marks the official start of Miami\u2019s high season, though\ndeal flow picked up\nweeks earlier this year.\nBrokerages have been sponsoring fewer major art fairs than in years prior, but they still have a presence. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is a\nshow partner at Art Basel\n, and Miami-based One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is the real estate sponsor for the collectors\u2019 lounge at the Miami Beach fair.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s also partnered with the Bonnier Gallery in Miami Beach to host an art exhibit that features works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Willem De Kooning and Andy Warhol, said Daniel de la Vega, president of One Sotheby\u2019s.\n\u201cThis is one of the most important weeks in Miami,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sale that happens while Art Basel is going on but it\u2019s about the feeling people get when they start to understand our lifestyle.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a smattering of what\u2019s planned this week:\nListings and new developments\nAgents Mick Duchon of the Corcoran Group and Dustin Nero of Douglas Elliman timed their launch of a listing at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club to art week. The unit, asking $22.8 million, or $4,916 per square foot, includes a multimillion-dollar art collection with works that have been featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. and the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami. Interior designer Deborah Wecselman handled the renovation of the 4,640-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-bathroom unit in the south tower of the Surf Club, at 9001 Collins Avenue in Surfside. The artwork includes pieces by Michael Dweck, Cey Adams and photographer David Burdeny.\nThe developers of the planned\nElle Residences Miami\ncondo tower, led by S3 Capital Partners, UNCG and Vertical Development launched an exhibit by artist Daniel Orozco that\u2019s on display this week at the project\u2019s sales center, at 600 Northeast 36th Street in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. The developers are hosting a private event this week with Orozco to discuss his sculpture collaboration with Elle.\nNorth Development, the partnership between Ricardo Dunin\u2019s Oak Capital and Juan Carlos Tassara\u2019s Edifica, commissioned Miami artists Jonathan Gonzalez, Francisco Lo Castro, Regina Durante Jestrow and Johnny Robles to design artwork for\nDomus Brickell Park\n, a short-term rental friendly development planned for the site at 1611 Southwest Second Avenue in Miami.\nNaftali Group tapped Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn to design a sculpture for JEM Private Residences, an apartment and condo tower\nunder construction\nat Miami Worldcenter.\nCarlos Rosso\u2019s Rosso Development, Proper Hospitality and Alex Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development are having two Hern\u00e1n Marina sculptures installed outside of the sales gallery at Midtown Park Residences by Proper, a spokesperson said. The sculptures will serve as public art to help promote the planned 28-story, 288-unit condo tower in Midtown Miami.\nWilliam Ticona\u2019s Grupo T&amp;C, the developer of the planned Edge House Miami short-term rental-friendly condo project in Edgewater, unveiled an exhibit featuring works by Colombian sculpture artist Veronica Matiz.\nAside from the artwork announcements, new installations and murals painted in neighborhoods such as Wynwood and the Miami Design District, and the dozens of parties and private events, real estate brokers and developers\u2019 group chats are buzzing \u2014 an indicator of the real estate activity art week generates.\n\u201cMany agents are talking about what they have available. Many are putting in requests,\u201d de la Vega of One Sotheby\u2019s said about some of the chats he\u2019s in.\nOne such request he saw this week was a buyer looking to spend $100 million for a waterfront property on the open bay, somewhere between Coral Gables and Miami Beach.",

        "content": "A Fort Worth mansion built for Texas Rangers co-owner Bob Simpson is headed to auction, giving luxury buyers a shot at one of the city\u2019s more extravagant residential curiosities.\nThe castle-style estate in Montserrat, a gated enclave in far southwest Fort Worth, will be auctioned by Concierge Auctions starting Dec. 3, with bidding expected to open between $4 million and $6.5 million, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The home at 9553 Bella Terra Drive, spanning 19,359 square feet on 2.12 hilltop acres, was commissioned for Simpson, the longtime\nFort Worth\nenergy executive who stepped down as CEO of TXO Energy Partners this spring but remains chairman.\nConcierge Auctions\nis marketing the estate, noting that Simpson sold the property in 2021. The home is now owned by John Lupo and Andreana Michael, according to Tarrant Appraisal District records.\nBuilt by Southlake-based J. Lambert Custom Homes, the estate sits on two parcels appraised at a combined $3.5 million. It last surfaced on the market at $11.75 million, but failed to trade.\nLike other high-end\nTexas listings\nthat have lingered as price ceilings meet softer demand, sellers are increasingly turning to auctions to widen the buyer pool and reset expectations.\nThe mansion leans into its castle branding. Nearly every room has a fireplace. It has seven bedrooms, 13 full baths and five half-baths, plus a 4,734-square-foot bonus area and separate guest quarters. The primary suite is its own compound-sized setup, with a spa-style bath, walk-in shower, Jacuzzi, a closet advertised as \u201cTexas-size\u201d and a private office perched above. It also connects directly to the indoor pool and hot tub.\nAmenities pile on from there: multiple gourmet kitchens and living spaces, a private theater, a custom gymnasium, indoor pool complex, climate-controlled wine room, sports court and a private pond with access to a community water feature. The setting, on an elevated ridge overlooking southwest Fort Worth, is part of the pitch.\nLuxury auctions\nhave become a familiar pressure valve in Texas\u2019 upper-tier market, especially for oversized, highly customized homes that don\u2019t slot neatly into comparable sales.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a decade of consistent payouts, SL Green shareholders could see prospects dim next year.\nThe prominent office landlord may be forced to slash its dividend next year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Dividend distributions are expected to surpass adjusted funds from operations \u2014 a cash flow metric \u2014 according to analysts.\n\u201cLower-than-expected (property) sales volumes in 2025 may elevate the risk of a dividend right-sizing,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa said in a client note, adding that he saw the landlord as a \u201cnet seller\u201d next year.\nSL Green did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nSince 2016, stockholders could count on an annual payout of around $3 per share. It even held steady as competitors such as Vornado Realty Trust, Empire State Realty Trust and\nBXP\nslashed their dividends.\nBut there are headwinds facing Marc Holliday\u2019s company, which is still smarting from its\nfailed bid\nfor a casino in Times Square. The company stock is down 30 percent year-to-date and lagging behind other office landlords. SL Green also targeted $1 billion in property sales this year, according to Sakwa, but sold less than half of that number.\nStill, SL Green is seeing success alongside its rivals on the Manhattan office leasing front. The company\u2019s portfolio is 92 percent occupied, paced by the success of the redeveloped One Madison Avenue.\nIn October, the firm agreed to buy the Park Avenue Tower in the Plaza District for\n$730 million\nfrom the Blackstone Group. The price tag is a discount from the roughly $925 million Blackstone put into acquiring and renovating the building since 2014.\nSL Green recently went into contract to buy the former Brooks Brothers building on Madison Avenue, where it aims to build its next ground-up office tower. It has also positioned itself in the running for new additions with an unsuccessful bid\nfor Paramount Group\nand\nexpressed interest in acquiring the Chrysler Building\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Gaia Real Estate moved its headquarters from New York to Miami, as it focuses on investment in South Florida\u2019s multifamily market.\nThe move comes after a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, which reached an apex in the three post-pandemic years. Gaia\u2019s heightened investment in the Magic City also comes at a questionable time for the rental market.\nGaia established its base at 8163 Northeast Second Avenue, after first opening an office there early this year, according to the firm\u2019s news release. It\u2019s expanding at the site, where it\u2019s leased a total of 5,000 square feet, with two new leases starting early next year.\nThe building is in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood.\nThe firm wants to be closer to its \u201ckey markets,\u201d Gaia CEO Danny Fishman said in the release, saying Miami has \u201cthe right momentum\u201d for Gaia\u2019s evolution.\nFounded in 2009 by Fishman and Ken Woolley, Gaia so far has been based primarily in New York. Over the years, it has invested more than $4 billion in the residential market across more than 20,000 units.\nIt\u2019s not ditching the Big Apple entirely, keeping an office at Carnegie Hall Tower, the release says. It has 35 staff members in New York, and 150 contracted employees at its property sites nationwide.\nThe Miami office will start out with 10 employees in January, and all new Gaia hiring will be here, according to the company. Some of the New York staff members will move to Miami or will work hybrid schedules between both offices.\nIn May, Gaia partnered with Miami-based Moderno Development Group to launch the first half of a\n$300 million\ninvestment fund to purchase and renovate or rebuild single-family homes and townhomes in South Florida. Through development and investment firm MILAS, which stands for Miami land and single-family, Gaia and Moderno plan to lease out all new homes that are part of the first phase.\nMonthly rents will range from $4,000 to $7,000, Doron Broman, Moderno CEO, told\nThe Real Deal\nin May.\nModerno, which also is based at 8163 Northeast Second Avenue, owns the building through an affiliate, according to records.\nSeparately from its Moderno partnership, Gaia also is focusing on value-add multifamily investments and also has a fully discretionary real estate investment trust for new multifamily properties in the Sun Belt, including in South Florida, the firm said.\nThe REIT has made roughly $300 million in investments in more than 1,000 units in Houston, Orlando and Nashville.\nSouth Florida\napartment\nleasing has slowed over the past years compared with the bonanza that ensued after the pandemic\u2019s onset. At the time, New Yorkers, Californians and other out-of-staters created\nunprecedented demand\nand prompted record rent growth.\nAfter developers seized the moment, they completed a record\n18,600 units last year\n, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group. That led to slower lease-ups, more concessions and a drop in rents, though developers are continuing\nhefty multifamily construction\n.\nIn the year that ended Sept. 30, construction started on 14,515 apartments in South Florida, according to CoStar.\nStill, Moderno and Gaia are focusing on single-family and townhome rentals, an asset class that Broman said in May has high demand and limited supply.\nGaia\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to Miami also shows the influx of New York firms to South Florida may not be over. Companies rushed south from 2020 to 2022 due to the state\u2019s early lifting of the lockdown and business-friendly climate, leasing big blocks of offices, though the migration had slowed in more recent years.\n",

        "content": "Co-op board members are rallying against proposed laws aimed at increasing transparency and curtailing discrimination in the co-op board application review process.\nBoard leaders pushed back against three New York City Council bills that would mandate co-op boards to disclose their reasons for denying an application, among other provisions, at a hearing before the committee on housing and buildings on Tuesday.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say this plainly: discrimination is happening today, and everyone knows it,\u201d committee chairperson Pierina Sanchez said in her opening remarks. \u201cSecrecy is not a neutral feature of the system. It is the condition that allows discrimination to flourish and go unchallenged.\u201d\nThe bills are the\nlatest iteration\nof city and state legislation looking to regulate the co-op application process, an undertaking that has long held a reputation for being onerous, opaque, and\nat times, discriminatory\n. Though previous attempts to pass similar legislation in the city have failed, nearby counties, such as Westchester, Suffolk and Nassau,\nhave adopted\ntheir own versions of the laws.\nMost of the testimony related to\nIntro 407\n, a rule co-proposed by Public Advocate Jumaane Wiliams and dubbed the \u201cReasons Bill.\u201d The legislation, if approved, would require boards to provide written explanations of why they turned down a prospective buyer\u2019s application to purchase an apartment.\nOpponents of the bill argue that provision would create more liability for co-op board members. As written, they claim the legislation requires an individual board member to sign off on the reasons disclosed \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d They also raised concerns that the bill would discourage owners from volunteering to serve on boards, which members say is already a tall order.\n\u201cIn the 28 years I\u2019ve been on the co-op board, I can count on one hand the number of applications we have rejected,\u201d said Will Kwan, who serves on the board of a co-op at 139 East 33rd Street. \u201cWhy have I been on the board so long? Because no one wants to volunteer their time.\u201d\nKwan later added that he felt lawmakers were trying to \u201cchoke the life out of co-ops\u201d with increasing regulation.\nWilliams responded, citing existing laws that target housing discrimination holding board members liable for their decisions on applications. He added that he was open to speaking with stakeholders to adjust language in the law to make compliance easier, though he believed that \u201csome version\u201d of the legislation was necessary.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is make some of the things that already exist more enforceable,\u201d Williams said.\nJohn Curtis, the vice president of a co-op at 370 Riverside Drive, suggested that Williams change the bill from requiring an individual member to sign off on the reasons to instead have the approval come from the co-op corporation. He also suggested that the board be required to state the primary reason, not every single reason taken into consideration.\nAmong the objections cited by the bill\u2019s opponents was a lack of data tied to claims of discrimination in co-ops. JoAnn Kamuf Ward, a representative with the city\u2019s commission on human rights, testified that of the 500 housing-related complaints filed with the agency last year, roughly 10 percent of them were about co-ops, and of those, only a handful were related to co-op purchases. (Individuals can also report claims of housing discrimination to state agencies or bring their own civil lawsuits.)\nWard\u2019s response sparked outbursts from members of the audience in an overflow meeting room, with one woman saying \u201cno kidding\u201d and later adding \u201cno shit.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no data,\u201d said Tanya Arias, an agent with Corcoran and board president at 45 Tudor City Place. She added that the conventional industry wisdom is that co-ops have a 3 to 5 percent rejection rate.\nCouncil member Lincoln Restler of North Brooklyn asked Ward whether she believed the low number of complaints was because prospective buyers lack insight into the board\u2019s decision-making process and therefore don\u2019t have any documentation or actionable evidence to bring forth a discrimination claim.\nBut Ward said that in most cases where discrimination is alleged, alleged victims typically don\u2019t have access to documentation when they initially make the claim. Others later testified that cases of discrimination in co-ops could be underreported because of the burdensome process to bring those claims forward.\nCouncil member Eric Dinowitz, who represents a district in the Bronx, suggested the committee refrain from moving any of the bills forward until more data becomes available, like the number of applications for co-op purchases and the rate of denial.\n\u201cDiscrimination is already illegal,\u201d Dinowitz said, adding later that the bills would likely significantly increase insurance and legal costs for boards. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more prudent to just get more data, get better data before we invariably increase the risk for individual board members and increase the costs for shareholders?\u201d\nSanchez interrupted testimony to say that though she understands the objections to the bills, \u201cyou are not the actors we\u2019re worried about.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the good folks,\u201d Sanchez said.\nBoard members also raised concerns about another bill, Intro 1120A, which would require co-op boards to mark an application as complete or incomplete within 10 days of receiving it. Once the application is considered complete, the board would then have 45 days to issue a decision, with an option for a 14-day extension.\nThe legislation was proposed by majority leader Amanda Farias of the Bronx, who said the bill was designed to \u201cput an end to the limitless waiting so many applicants endure.\u201d\nOpponents of the bill largely took issue with a provision in the proposed law that would grant an automatic acceptance of an application if the board failed to respond within the timeline.\n\u201cThat person could be financially unqualified or dangerous or just not a good fit, and the board would lose the opportunity to vote on that person,\u201d Rebecca Poole, membership director of the Council of New York Cooperatives &amp; Condominiums, said in an interview ahead of the hearing.\n\u201cAll other timing bills come with a fine or financial penalty for not meeting that deadline,\u201d she said and added that often delays are due to issues outside of the board\u2019s control. \u201cAutomatic acceptance is problematic.\u201d\nNot all those present from the industry were there to testify against the bill. Michael Kelly with the New York State Association of Realtors, Yvette Clark Watkins with the Long Island Board of Realtors and Crystal Hawkins Syska of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors testified in support of the legislation.\n",

        "content": "One year before his death, Jeffrey Epstein boasted about putting Core Club\u2019s founders on the map.\nWithin the financier\u2019s tangled social web were the private club\u2019s founders, according to messages in the 20,000-page trove of documents recently released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\nCore Club, founded in 2005, is an\ninvite-only members\u2019 organization\nthat first opened in 2005 at 66 East 55th Street (also known as 711 Fifth Avenue). Founders Jennie and Dangene Enterprise developed partnerships with real estate bigwigs to build out the social club for millionaires and billionaires. RFR\u2019s Aby Rosen, for example, was a founding member, investor and landlord,\naccording\nto the Commercial Observer.\nEpstein, the late financier accused of sexually abusing underage girls, had his own expansive maze of connections to the rich and powerful, the same kind of people Jennie Enterprise worked to cultivate.\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d Epstein wrote in a personal message to an unknown recipient in 2018. The context was about former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, whom Epstein wrote was \u201cfriends with the current female owners of the core club, 50 yr old lesbians.\u201d\nEpstein died in 2019. The latest papers have emerged following the House\u2019s review of the federal government\u2019s investigation into Epstein before his death.\nA Core Club spokesperson, in an email, refuted the idea of Epstein\u2019s involvement. \u201c[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d said the spokesperson, who did not offer a name.\nScaramucci did not respond to a request for comment, but as of 2018 had been a Core Club member since the brand opened in 2005,\naccording to ELLE\nmagazine.\nCore Club has become both a meeting point for powerful people in real estate and finance. Private clubs are a sought-after tenant because they can bring cachet \u2014 and amenities \u2014 to an address and are\noften tied\nto trophy real estate assets.\nSomewhere between Core Club\u2019s founding and 2016, Enterprise and Epstein appear to have developed a personal relationship whose chumminess is evident in emails sent after the election that year.\nOn Nov. 27, 2016, Epstein emailed the Enterprises:\nEpstein: What is the relaxation machine in waiting area\nJennie Enterprise: soma dome \u2026. How was your thanksgiving ? Love u\nEpstein: really fun,\u00a0 im in palm with the trump crowd\nEnterprise: cool ! Lets go to the inauguration together !!!\nOn Feb. 19, 2016, Enterprise sent Epstein an email with the subject line, \u201cTRUMP / POPE SCORECARD \u2026..\u201d\n\u201cTRUMP 1 POPE 0,\u201d Enterprise wrote in large red text. Earlier that week, Pope Francis and Trump had exchanged jabs online and to reporters.\nIn March 2018, Enterprise contacted Epstein again, this time to share a New York Post article about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s divorce.\nThe Core Club spokesperson did not address the personal emails between Enterprise and Epstein.\nCore Club, which has boasted powerful clientele like Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, attracted other members of the Trump circle beyond Scaramucci. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, dipped into shell company funds to pay initiation fees and dues to the club,\naccording\nto the New Yorker.\nIn recent years, Core Club and its founders\nbattled with\ndeveloper Michael Shvo. Enterprise and Core sued Shvo for $600 million over his failure to deliver on three lavish expansion locations. Shvo countered that Core Club defaulted on its San Francisco lease for $178 million.\n",

        "content": "Dean Rouso dialed a phone number and a cheerful woman\u2019s voice picked up on the other line. The words belonged to Remi, a new AI assistant Baird &amp; Warner launched for its agents this week.\nThe custom AI assistant is one of many tools Chicago-area brokerages and agents are using to\nautomate workflow\n, as\nAI takes a bigger role\nin the real estate market.\nRouso, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at\nBaird &amp; Warner\n, said the brokerage\u2019s new AI tool seeks to solve a bottleneck in its office operations: answering administrative questions that slow down dealmaking and clog up managing brokers\u2019 time.\nManaging brokers and staff in other departments are \u201climited to the hours that are not the most active hours in our industry, which are when the consumer wants us,\u201d Rouso said.\nThe program, which is built on a software called Broker Bot, acts as a virtual assistant for agents\u2019 questions. It is trained on Baird and Warner\u2019s company data and federal, state and local regulations and policy, Rouso said. Baird &amp; Warner claims the bot is the first in the industry to have that level of direct institutional knowledge about brokerage and local policy.\n\u201cThere is nobody that I have heard of that has trained this kind of assistant to the level that we have,\u201d he said.\nBaird &amp; Warner has exclusive rights to BrokerBot\u2019s enterprise tier in Chicago for a year, Rouso said. He declined to share the cost of the contract, but the lower tier on BrokerBot for up to 250 agents is $2,000 monthly, and the tool will be available to Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s more than 2,000 agents.\nIn a quick live demo on Tuesday, Rouso asked Remi where to submit a request for listing photos in Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s platform, and the program directed him to log in at a specific internal company link. When prompted further, it gave him an overview of the cost of different photo packages. Some blind spots exist: He asked the bot to text him a link to the webpage, rather than read it out over the phone, and Remi said it wasn\u2019t able to do that.\nWhen the bot doesn\u2019t know the answer to something, Rouso said his team gets notified, and they work on updating its functions and knowledge base.\nThe AI tool was shared with Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s managing brokers and some agents before the wide release Wednesday, and they were already finding good uses for it, Rouso said. One managing broker got a text from an agent on a Friday night while at the gym, asking where to find a specific commercial addendum to close a deal. Away from his computer, the managing broker was able to ask Remi where to find the contract and relay that back to the agent.\nIt can\u2019t do everything yet. Remi answers questions, and can help draft some writing, but it can\u2019t fill out a contract, make full marketing materials, send an email or access an agent\u2019s calendar to give them a look at upcoming meetings. Some of those functionalities are coming soon, Rouso said.\nHis team is testing a function that allows the bot to send emails, read an agent\u2019s calendar and set appointments. The firm is also working with a separate company on an AI tool that will help agents fill out contracts.\nChicago real estate embraces AI\nRemi is launching into a real estate world filled with AI tools and competition between brokerages for the most cutting-edge tech. Compass, the\nnational brokerage\nthat has invested heavily in its tech platform, has touted its AI tools.\nRafael Murillo, a Chicago Compass agent, said he uses the company\u2019s AI software every day and called it a \u201ccheat code\u201d for boosting productivity. AI can draft and send emails to clients, organize client information and keep on top of an agent\u2019s calendar.\n\u201cI have it creating social media marketing, calendar, assisting with my emails,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of using it for almost everything now.\u201d\nCompass also has a program called Likely to Sell, which uses predictive analytics to flag contacts in an agent\u2019s database who might list their homes soon, a feature Murillo credits with handing him two to three extra deals a year.\nElsewhere, teams without brokerage specific tech are finding tools to automate their workflow. Tommy Choi, of the Weinberg Choi Residential team at Keller Williams, said his team uses a note-taking software to organize transcripts of client meetings and import information into their client relationship management system. They also use an app for social listening, which scours social media for posts that could deliver new leads.\nThe social listening system has improved his team\u2019s retention by flagging when clients may be considering buying or selling, Choi said.\n\u201cThe use cases are still very elementary, and I feel like, hopefully, we\u2019re at a place where more innovators come into the space to create more tools utilizing AI,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi has seen the downsides of AI, too. He recalled a negotiation where another agent used ChatGPT to write details of an offer, accidentally offering the buyer a credit to cover potential issues if they came up during an inspection that the agent\u2019s client hadn\u2019t approved.\nChoi also said he\u2019s concerned about the potential for accidental bias in AI models as they become more common in the real estate industry. A model trained on existing housing data could inadvertently replicate fair housing problems, he said.\n\u201cIf agents aren\u2019t being careful and really looking into what data is going in before they hit send, my fear is that it could lead to fair housing issues down the line,\u201d he said.\nColdwell Banker Realty recently had a sales rally focused on AI, said regional president Ayoub Rabah. The company has some AI functions in its Listing Concierge platform that create marketing content, and agents use other tools like ChatGPT and Copilot.\nThe brokerage is also focused on teaching agents how to write content that ranks highly in AI answers, Rabah said.\n\u201cWhen you take a look at how many consumers are shopping today, they\u2019re going to ChatGPT or Copilot or Perplexity, and they\u2019re saying, I\u2019m shopping for a home in this community,\u201d Rabah said. \u201cAnd we want to make sure that our agents are trained and educated so they are the answer.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A long-dead Menards site in Hoffman Estates is finally getting new life, with the village board signing off on a 335-unit luxury apartment complex aimed at jump-starting activity at the east end of Barrington Square Town Center.\nThe two-building project by Synergy Construction and Development, operating as Grand Reserve, will roll out in phases, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The developer says it\u2019s starting construction along Higgins Road to maximize visibility to passing traffic, with the second structure following soon after the first wraps in roughly 18 months. A prior pitch in 2023 from\nThe Prime Company\nto develop a 600-unit luxury apartment complex on the site never got legs.\nPhase one calls for a five-story, 194-unit building with studios and one- and two-bedroom units over 282 parking spaces, with 86 spaces in a garage. The second, four-story structure will add 141 similar units and 206 parking spaces, including 11 spaces indoors. Across both buildings, residents will get 20,000 square feet of amenities, including a gym, pool and pickleball courts, coworking areas, golf simulators and dog wash stations. Construction is expected to begin this spring and be completed by 2030.\nThe board\nalso approved up to $8 million in tax increment financing eligibility, contingent on completion of both buildings.\nTrustee Gary Stanton raised concerns about parking congestion for Barrington Square tenants, though\nVillage Manager\nEric Palm said the businesses want the increase in nearby residents. Retailers see the added foot traffic as a net gain, Palm said, despite long-standing skepticism about residential projects tapping TIF funds.\nMayor Bill McLeod, who has usually opposed using TIF dollars for housing, signed on after trustees noted that rental buildings behave more like commercial properties under the tax model and bring few school-age children. The complex is also subject to annual reporting protocols that let school districts capture additional funds if enrollment rises.\nThe site\u2019s TIF district, created in 2012 after Menards\u2019 demolition, expires in 2035. With the clock running,\nvillage\nofficials pitched the subsidy as a short-term play for long-term tax base growth, easing pressure on existing homeowners.\nTrustee Patrick Kinnane said the project finally puts a \u201cprime piece of real estate\u201d back in motion after more than a decade of stagnation, aligning with the retail center next door and the village\u2019s broader push to revive underused commercial corridors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is\nagain sounding the alarm\non commercial real estate, sharpening its focus on office-heavy loan books at community and regional banks that are absorbing the brunt of the post-pandemic reset.\nIn its latest supervision and regulation report, the central bank cited \u201celevated interest rates, tighter underwriting standards and lower commercial property values\u201d as pressure points that could complicate refinancings and push more borrowers toward distress, Bloomberg reported.\nFor real estate players, the subtext is familiar: lenders are bracing for more pain across offices and other challenged asset classes. The Fed\u2019s message isn\u2019t that banks are in danger but that the CRE drag is persistent and refinancing risk remains elevated.\nWith valuations drifting lower and buyers hesitant, banks holding CRE debt are navigating a landscape where even stable sponsors can struggle to extend maturing loans. Fed supervisors said they\u2019re not just tracking CRE trends but also scrutinizing credit-loss reserves and how aggressively banks are marking their portfolios.\nWhile the Fed found most institutions still well above minimum capital thresholds through the second quarter, watchdogs are taking a closer look at capital planning and liquidity management on Wall Street, according to the report.\nThe latest round of stress tests suggested big banks could weather a recession without triggering capital breaches or a freeze in lending, but policymakers are trying to keep attention trained on \u201cmaterial risks\u201d \u2014 including interest rate impacts and cybersecurity threats \u2014 a mantra championed by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman.\nRegulators have eased certain capital rules this year and recently finalized tweaks to ratings for large banks, but the Fed signaled fresh vulnerabilities are cropping up. A spate of private credit defaults has raised concerns about banks\u2019 indirect exposure to nonbanks, where leverage is higher and oversight lighter.\nSupervisors plan to monitor that channel closely as traditional lenders keep partnering with private credit platforms hungry for deal flow.\nThe agency is also deepening its review of banks\u2019 recovery plans, focusing on how quickly institutions can marshal real-time data if those plans ever need to be activated. That includes strategies to shore up liquidity for key operations under multiple resolution scenarios.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A controversial bill that would give nonprofits first dibs to buy multifamily properties will now be less sweeping, but changes to the measure have not won over its fiercest critics.\nAn amended version of the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA, would apply to multifamily buildings with four or more units that are also considered distressed or that have affordability requirements that recently expired or will soon end. The previous iteration simply applied to properties with three or more units.\nThe new version of the bill shrinks the pool of buildings subject to COPA and also decreases the exclusivity window granted to \u201cqualified entities.\u201d It also changes the structure of how buildings that don\u2019t comply are fined.\nWhen such buildings go up for sale, \u201cqualified entities\u201d approved by the city would be given the first opportunity to buy the properties. The new bill expands the definition of \u201cqualified entities\u201d to include for-profit companies that form a joint venture with nonprofits. That means those joint ventures, alongside nonprofits, will also have the right of first refusal under COPA.\nThe measure additionally excludes owner-occupied buildings with five or fewer units, while also making vacant lots zoned for residential use eligible for COPA sales.\nThe changes address a number of critiques of the previous bill, and even follow a suggestion\nmade by the Adams administration\nto limit the buildings eligible to those in significant and financial distress.\nBased on HPD\u2019s response on Tuesday, the agency hasn\u2019t yet been won over. A spokesperson\nprovided the same statement\ngiven to\nThe Real Deal\nlast week in response to the previous bill, saying that the agency is \u201ccommitted to providing input and feedback to ensure that all potential effects are fully evaluated and considered.\u201d The spokesperson said the agency is \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Council member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, for her \u201ccontinued engagement.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that, by working closely with diverse stakeholders, we\u2019ve refined the bill while keeping its central purpose intact: preserving and expanding permanently affordable homes for New Yorkers,\u201d Nurse said.\nWill Spisak, senior policy strategist for the nonprofit New Economy Project, which advocated for COPA, said the bill now targets buildings that could most benefit from working with nonprofits that specialize in preservation work. He said COPA could also help buildings that would otherwise be shuffled between speculative buyers on their way to the city\u2019s lien sale.\nBut not all stakeholders are on board.\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, doesn\u2019t think the bill is workable even with the changes.\n\u201cClearly it still has in the crosshairs, small building operators,\u201d she said. \u201cBuildings end up on this distressed list because of state and city policies and housing courts.\u201d\nProperty owners and brokers sounded the alarm on the bill last month, saying it would devastate the city\u2019s multifamily market. Broker Bob Knakal, at the time, said the City Council had \u201cdropped a bomb on the multifamily market.\u201d\nMatt Cosentino, who leads multifamily sales at Brooklyn-based brokerage TerraCRG, acknowledged that the timeframes included in the new bill are preferable to the previous proposals, but said the new parameters around how a building qualifies will create confusion for owners.\nThe measure lays out various ways a building is considered distressed, including if it is part of the city\u2019s\nalternative enforcement program\n, has significant tax liens, is subject to the city\u2019s\nemergency repairs program\nor has unpaid municipal charges totaling $1,500 or more per unit. The bill also leaves the door open for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to add its own qualifying criteria.\nProperties that had an affordability requirement expire in the past two years, or that have one expiring in the next two, would also be subject to COPA.\nThe bill additionally lays out a new timeline for these deals. For COPA buildings, an owner must give HPD at least five days, instead of 180, before moving to sell their building.\nQualified nonprofits and community land trusts will then have 45 days, rather than 60, to submit a letter of intent to make an offer on the property. They then have 90 days (starting after the 45-day limit runs out) to bid on the building.\nUnder the old version, the time limits ran concurrently, totaling 180 days. The new bill has windows that run consecutively, pausing these transactions for 135 days.\nOwners who fail to abide by COPA and sell their building to someone who is not a \u201cqualified entity,\u201d will be on the hook for a fine equal to at least 3 percent of the purchase price.\nEven some proponents of the bill aren\u2019t happy with this latest version.\nKenny Burgos, CEO of New York Apartment Association, said focusing on distressed properties will lead to fewer deals and make it harder for tenants looking to purchase buildings (by working with a nonprofit) due to the extent of repairs and debt on these properties. If the bill passes in its current form, he believes it will simply delay transactions.\n\u201cI just think the bill is losing its original intent in giving tenants the opportunity to purchase,\u201d he said.\nOther cities\n(including Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Chicago) have adopted similar policies, providing the right of first offer and/or refusal to nonprofits or a building\u2019s tenants. In New York, the state legislature is also considering a Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, or TOPA, which would give tenants first dibs on buying their building.\nA version of COPA was introduced in the City Council in 2020 and has been the subject of multiple hearings,\nmost recently\nin June. At that time, the NYAA pointed to San Francisco\u2019s COPA policy, which gives nonprofits 30 days to exercise their right of first refusal, as a potentially more reasonable timeframe.\nTime is running out for yet another version of the bill to emerge. The last City Council meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.\nThe success of San Francisco\u2019s version and other COPA policies relies on a consistent stream of funding being available for nonprofits. Spisak noted that New York City\u2019s bill would go into effect one year after becoming law, giving time for the program to be factored into next year\u2019s budget.\nThe Adams administration also recently\nrelaunched\nthe Neighborhood Pillars program, which could help buyers under COPA finance building rehabs.\nSome have reservations about whether HPD could handle the administrative burden of ensuring buildings comply with COPA.\nErica Buckley, a partner at Nixon Peabody, thinks before a sweeping bill like COPA is enacted, HPD should launch a voluntary pilot program to test it out. She noted that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who called for COPA\u2019s passage, could create a program that allows the agency to figure out the staffing levels required and includes a term sheet that would help line up public financing for these deals.\nShe said the program could also incorporate more direct efforts to encourage homeownership among tenants.\nTesting out this model before approving COPA citywide could also give the city, nonprofits and owners time to better understand the complexity of such deals. Buckley has worked on a few deals where a nonprofit is buying a building, with the intent of eventually turning ownership over to tenants.\n\u201cThey are incredibly expensive, and they take a lot more time than you think,\u201d she said.\n",

        "content": "Monadnock Development scored a large sum of money to develop a 300-unit multifamily project in Gowanus.\nNick Lembo\u2019s firm landed $175 million in construction financing for a development at 155 Third Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. PCCP and U.S. Bank provided the debt for the project, which will unfurl along the Gowanus Canal.\nA JLL Capital Markets team including Christopher Peck, Winfield Clifford and Kellogg Gaines arranged the debt.\nThe 22-story project is sited to the west of the canal\u2019s northern end. It will include 225 market-rate apartments and 75 affordable units; the development was approved under the 421a affordable housing program prior to its lapse.\nThere will also be 30,000 square feet of commercial space and ground-floor retail, which will connect to a planned seven-acre esplanade. The development is expected to be completed by the last quarter of 2027.\nProjects continue to pop up in Gowanus, which was rezoned four years ago to unlock mixed-use developments where manufacturing hubs once reigned. At the time, city officials estimated that the\n82-block rezoning\nwould enable the construction of more than 8,500 apartments, 3,000 of which would be reserved for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers.\nGowanus was one of the Bill de Blasio administration\u2019s largest upzonings. Developers have responded in kind by trying to take advantage of the neighborhood\u2019s revitalization into a residential hub.\nLast month, David Tabak purchased a 38,500-square-foot development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus\nfor $58.5 million\n. He\u2019s planning a 12-story, 350-unit residential building.\nMeanwhile, Monadnock \u2014 along with the Gotham Organization and nonprofit Christian Cultural Center \u2014 landed\na $315 million loan\nin the spring for their affordable housing project in East New York. The loan finances the construction of 453 rental units at the site, which used to be a vacant parking lot at the church\u2019s 10-and-a-half-acre Brooklyn campus\n.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The school completed the purchase with funding entirely provided by the state\u2019s Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program. The total budget for the purchase was approximately $168.1 million, including the debt needed to pay off bonds required to help finance the project.\nAn affiliate of Throckmorton Partners sold the property, at 184 South Market Street.\nThrockmorton bought the building\n, a 264-room\ntower part of the Signia by Hilton San Jose hotel\n, in 2023 for $73.1 million. The Signia hotel remains open across the Paseo in a large building with 541 rooms. Throckmorton undertook the conversion of one of Signia\u2019s towers into student housing for SJSU attendees, opening the property as Spartan Village on The Paseo\nin August 2024\n.\nMill Valley-based Throckmorton Partners previously leased the tower to San Jose State University and agreed to give SJSU the option to buy and own the future student housing building. The handover of Spartan Village on The Paseo marks \u201cthe culmination of a landmark collaboration\u201d between Throckmorton and the university, SJSU President Cynthia Teniente-Matson said.\nSpartan Village on The Paseo rises 13 stories in downtown San Jose above the Paseo de San Antonio pedestrian mall. The tower can accommodate at least 679 student beds with a maximum capacity of 811 beds. A sky bridge lounge remains a popular gathering spot for students, connecting directly to the second floor, which has several dining options for students.\nIt\u2019s the latest vote of confidence in San Jose\u2019s central business district as a hub for SJSU students. Last year, Amcal Housing and Swenson secured a\n$150 million refinancing deal\nfor their 19-story The Grad San Jose student housing complex. That development, a 260-unit high-rise at 88 East San Carlos Street, is just a few blocks away from Spartan Village on The Paseo.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Texas State University is bringing a long-discussed hospitality anchor to its San Marcos campus, approving a $40 million boutique hotel that Houston-based Midway will build with a 75-year ground lease.\nThe university\u2019s Board of Regents signed off on the development agreement Nov. 20, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n, granting\nMidway\ncontrol of a 3-acre site at 429 North Guadalupe Street with options for two 10-year extensions. The parcel once housed the school\u2019s Richard A. Castro Undergraduate Admissions Center and sits just north of downtown, positioning the project to pull double duty for campus and\ncity\nevents.\nPlans call for a 120,000-square-foot, full-service hotel with at least 130 rooms and a slate of amenities rarely found in the area: an event lawn and amphitheater, restaurant and bar, pool and courtyard and modern meeting spaces. Regents said the project will be the only full-service hotel of its kind near downtown San Marcos, giving the school more flexibility in hosting state and national conferences, while also feeding local tourism at a time when the metro is bulging with growth.\nSan Marcos\n, roughly 30 miles south of\nAustin\n, now counts close to 75,000 residents, and Texas State enrolls about 40,000 students. University officials pitched the hotel as overdue for a downtown that has struggled to keep pace with regional demand.\n\u201cSan Marcos is long overdue for a true, full-service, top-of-the-line hotel and restaurant in the heart of downtown,\u201d Eric Algoe, the university\u2019s vice president for operations and CFO, said in a news release.\nMidway, which has completed comparable projects in College Station, secured city and county incentives earlier this year. The city of San Marcos approved a $9.1 million package paid out over 10 installments, with no property tax rebates but significant returns on other fronts: a 95 percent rebate on sales taxes and hotel occupancy taxes that phases down over time, as well as a rebate on construction sales taxes. The city will require Midway to invest at least $40 million, start construction by the end of 2026 and finish within 30 months.\nOfficials estimate the hotel will generate $2.4 million in city property taxes over the first decade and $456,000 in retained sales taxes. The hotel occupancy tax rebate could reach $7.3 million, with the city keeping another $1.8 million. The incentive agreement runs 15 years from completion, after which Midway can sell its interest to a public entity without paying the incentives back.\nAustin-based New Waterloo will operate the hotel, adding to a portfolio that includes South Congress Hotel and Hotel Ella.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The amendments would require referendums to decide whether Boca Raton could lease or sell any public land larger than 0.5 acres, something its proponents said would protect public land and that opponents decried as gumming up crucial city management processes.\nOn Monday, Palm Beach County Judge Joseph Curley ruled that the referendums were unconstitutional, citing precedent that ruled electorates do not have authority to subject city council action to referendum.\nLocal attorney Ned Kimmelman sued Save Boca and Pearlman in early October, seeking an emergency injunction to block the referendums.\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the suit read.\nIn a curious sequence of events, Kimmelman quickly withdrew the suit, only to file it again on Oct. 31. This time, a new organization, Rescue Boca Community Initiative, filed an amicus brief in support of Kimmelman. In the brief, Rescue Boca alleged Save Boca accepted more than $40,000 in donations before registering as a political committee.\nParties on all sides of the issue have alleged others are spreading misinformation, including at the Tuesday city council meeting. At the meeting, the council approved ballot language for the March referendum on One Boca, which only concerns approval of the project.\nPearlman asserted that while Judge Curley granted the injunction, the suit is ongoing and Save Boca is still pursuing the changes to the city charter and municipal code.\nTerra and Frisbie have\nwhittled down the scope of One Boca\nconsiderably in recent months, with the plan consisting now of just 7.6 acres, down from 15.4.\n",

        "content": "High-density housing could come to the site of former big-box stores near Del Amo Fashion Center in\nTorrance\n.\nVista Homes is planning to demolish a former Sports Authority and Sears Outlet site at 3610 Torrance Boulevard to make way for a new multifamily development, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The developer\u2019s proposal calls for 449 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, with 45 of them designated for low-income households.\nBy including deed-restricted affordable units in the development, Vista\u2019s project is eligible for density bonus incentives, which will allow the developer to build a larger structure than zoning rules would typically allow. The project, designed by Ovalle Architects, would rise in a podium-style building of six to eight stories. The structure would be built atop a parking garage with capacity for 815 vehicles.\nConstruction is slated to begin in February, according to an environmental report tied to the project. It\u2019s expected to wrap in September 2028.\nThe development is the latest to be proposed near Del Amo Fashion Center.\nLegacy Partners\nand DWS Group, for example, are building 200 apartments at 3863 West Carson Street for the Soto development, which will replace a surface parking lot. Lennar, meanwhile, is\nbuilding 260 townhomes\non a 16-acre site at 3405 West Carson Street and 21405-21515 Madrona Avenue for a development known as Fashion Square at Del Amo.\nAnother fully entitled development site in Torrance came under new ownership over the summer and is similarly in the midst of construction. CGI+ Real Estate Strategies\nsold the 4.9-acre location\nat 22107-22127 Vermont Avenue in Torrance to JPI for $40 million. In 2023, the Los Angeles County Development Authority approved a 525-unit housing project for the site known as The Bungalows on Vermont Avenue. Plans for that development call for a six-story building with studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments; of the 525 units, 35 are set aside for families making 30 percent of the area median income.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Billionaire\nKen Griffin\nlanded a buyer for his penthouse at Park Tower, selling his last holdout of listed Chicago property three years after he headed south.\nThe 67th floor unit at 800 North Michigan Avenue is under contract with an undisclosed buyer, with a $12.5 million listing price. The six-bedroom, seven bathroom Streeterville condo spans 9,250 square feet.\nGriffin, the Citadel founder, left Chicago and moved his business to\nMiami in 2022\n, citing concerns about crime in Chicago. He has been\noffloading his portfolio\nof downtown properties in the years since. Forbes pegs his net worth at $49.8 billion.\nIf $12.5 million is the final closing price on the penthouse, it would be the most expensive sale for a single condo in downtown Chicago in at least three years, as the area has struggled to gain its footing since its pandemic-era heights.\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s\ncombined purchase in November 2024 of two units from Griffin at 9 West Walton Street for $19 million was the only recent sale with a higher price.\nSusan Miner of Premier Relocation and Real Estate Services, the listing agent on the Park Tower condo, did not return a request for comment.\nGriffin sold the 66th-floor penthouse, below the 67th floor penthouse, at Park Tower to\nGeorge Lucas in 2023\nfor $11.2 million, taking a loss on the $15 million he paid for the unit in 2012. Lucas and his wife, Mellody Hobson, bought the unit to combine it with their 65th-floor penthouse that they bought in 2015.\nGriffin also sold the top four floors at No. 9 West Walton \u2014 including the sale to Pritzker \u2014 over the last year for a combined $35 million, losing more than $20 million from his 2017 purchase price for the units.\nThe 67th-floor condo at Park Tower was listed in 2022 asking $15.75 million. It was on and off the market at the same price in the years since then, and was last taken off the market in July. On Wednesday, the listing went back up, showing it was under contract at the new $12.5 million price.\nThe sale would mark one of a string of condo sales in Chicago this year after a long slump in recent years. Property prices have tanked as concerns about crime and work-from-home norms have kept buyers out of downtown. Buyers have been showing more interest in downtown luxury properties, but they are still selling well below their sale prices of two or three years ago.\nOther recent downtown sales include a 79th-floor St. Regis condo that sold for $7.5 million, and another at that building that Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus purchased for $9.25 million. Former Chicago Bulls star Zach LaVine sold his 28th-floor condo at 9 West Walton in November for $6.4 million, taking a half-million dollar loss on the unit from his purchase price in 2022.\nThis most recent pending penthouse sale would land Griffin a better return than his other Chicago selloffs. He paid $6.9 million for the condo in 2000, representing a roughly 80 percent gain over the past 25 years.\n",

The buyer has not been disclosed. The Willenborgs first listed the home in 2023 for $32 million and later\ndropped the asking price to $26 million\n.\nIn the two years afterward, the\nSan Francisco luxury housing market\nremained in post-pandemic doldrums before an upswing this year. As artificial intelligence firms flock to San Francisco and the Bay Area at large, so too do the number of executives and employees looking for high-end places to live \u2014 so much so that there\u2019s now a\nshortage of mansions\nin the city for those buyers.\n\u201cWhat a difference 808 days makes,\u201d Compass listing agent Max Armour told the Business Times. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from forecasts of decline to one of the strongest luxury cycles I\u2019ve seen in years, driven by AI, rising markets and renewed confidence in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe Broadway home was completed in 1899 and survived the 1906 earthquake, which destroyed nearly all of the city, with little damage. It was later featured in films like 1960\u2019s \u201cPortrait in Black\u201d featuring Lana Turner and 1985\u2019s \u201cJagged Edge\u201d starring Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges and Robert Loggia.\nThe mansion also twice served as the\nSan Francisco Decorator Showcase home\nin 1989 and 2024, with more than 20,000 visitors shuffling through the home each time. The five-level mansion boasts more than 11,000 square feet of living space, complete with 10 bedrooms, six bathrooms, eight fireplaces, two laundry rooms, a garden, wine storage capabilities and three storerooms.\nBillionaires\u2019 Row has seen an uptick in high-profile sales activity compared to recent years, according to Armour. Last month, the most expensive home in the city this year sold at 2930 Broadway\nfor $42 million\n; that followed the $26.5 million sale of 2900 Broadway next door to the Willenborgs\u2019 2898 Broadway, in the spring.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Other parcels adjoining King Place bring the total size of the area under Glendenning\u2019s ownership to 600 acres.\nThe 78-acre lot secured by the loan is Block C, the southwesternmost of three blocks in the King Place plat. It abuts Dallas North Tollway and FM 428, recently named Glendenning Parkway. Unofficial plats don\u2019t specify how the land will be used, but the development overall will include retail, offices, hotels and hundreds of single-family homes.\nThis financing is Glendenning\u2019s largest loan on the King Place project in Collin County records so far.\nGlendenning\u2019s company, Rex Real Estate, has plans for nearby sites as well. The company is selling several mixed-use, commercial and retail plots within a few miles of King Place along the DNT and Glendenning Parkway.\nRex Real Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA Celina native, Glendenning has turned his holdings into some of the most noteworthy real estate deals in North Texas during his 40-year career, including the sale of The Star, the multibillion-dollar mixed-use headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys. His family\u2019s land history began with a grant to his great-grandfather in the 19th century, the 160-acre germ of a now-vast operation.\nKing Place,\nwhich may become the site of Rex Real Estate\u2019s headquarters\n, is Glendenning\u2019s own contribution to a crowded pool of developments near Celina.\nSeitz Group\n,\nHillwood\n,\nCedarwood\n, the\nCelina Economic Development Corporation\n, Jerry Jones\u2019\nBlue Star Land\n, and\nGlendenning\u2019s occasional partner Mehrdad Moayedi\nhave all begun residential or commercial projects in the area.\n",

Now, the lender is trying to sell off equity interests in the property later this month, while Croman is arguing the process has gone awry.\nIt\u2019s the latest skirmish in Croman\u2019s legal battle with lenders, who are together trying to foreclose on more than $231 million in loan principal. In the background is\nhis fight with his father,\nEdward Croman, who is hoping to dissolve the family partnerships, alleging mismanagement.\nSteven, Edward and Harriet Croman bought the building at 12 East 72nd Street in 2002 through a shell company for $5.5 million, according to\ncontemporaneous reporting\nfrom the New York Times. The property was a six-story multifamily building at the time, off Fifth Avenue, but Croman was able to boot tenants out of its 23 rent-stabilized units and renovate the building into a personal mansion.\nInitial plans for the home included two pools, a koi pond, a basketball court, six wet bars and two fireplaces, according to contemporaneous reporting from the\nNew York Observer\n. However, it\u2019s unclear to what extent these plans were completed.\nThe now-single-family home is currently valued at $53 million and is more than 15,000 square feet, according to city records. In 2023, Croman\u2019s company took out a $31 million loan from Axos Bank backed by the property, as well as the family\u2019s membership interests in the borrower.\nBy the next year, the loan was in default. In a court filing, Croman blamed the legal dispute with his father for the inability to service or refinance the loan. The lender is planning to sell the membership interests on December 11 in a UCC sale.\nSteve and Harriet Croman, however, are arguing in court that their home is unique and valuable, and a quick sale process will depress what the lender can recover at the sale. The lender isn\u2019t properly advertising the property, they said, and is putting up barriers that will limit public interest, like mandatory nondisclosure agreements. They\u2019re asking the court to pause the sale and issue a preliminary injunction.\nArguments like this are common in UCC sales, and hinge on the requirement that a sale be \u201ccommercially reasonable.\u201d\nThe lender in the case, NYC Multifamily Portfolio LLC, is connected to Dalan Real Estate. The company purchased\n$140 million of Croman-connected loans\nlast year from Axos Bank and has since filed several foreclosure suits.\nA lawyer for the defendant didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, but told the court that putting a stop to the sale is neither \u201cnecessary nor appropriate.\u201d\nCroman is also named as a defendant in\n28 other foreclosure cases\n, related to loans totaling more than $231 million in principal. Twenty-one of those suits were brought by Orange Owner LLC, associated with Bellwether Asset Management. In October, the entity bought loans tied to\n49 Croman buildings\nfor $247 million from Flagstar Bank, according to Traded.\nCroman is one of the few New York landlords to have been sent to prison for real estate-related crimes. Once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords, Croman served eight months in state prison related to mortgage and tax fraud and paid $8 million in restitution related to accusations of tenant harassment.\nMatthew Ethan Hearle, an attorney with Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein who is representing the Cromans in the dispute, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A developer scaled back his plan for a 500-unit project with mostly apartments near Naranja to a 245 townhome complex, citing higher demand for larger homes.\nAttorney Gus Deribeaux, through two entities, wants to develop the townhomes on a 17.3-acre mostly vacant site on the southwest corner of Old Dixie Highway and Southwest 280th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to an application filed to the county late last month.\nThe site consists of the vacant lots at 28030 and 28240 Old Dixie Highway, and 15450 Southwest 280th Street, and the lot at 28105 Southwest 157th Avenue that now has a single-family home.\nDesigned by Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates, the complex would consist of two-story buildings with five townhomes. The homes will range from two-bedrooms to four-bedroom townhomes.\nThe switch of plans is due to more demand for south Miami-Dade housing from families, who generally seek bigger homes, said Ben Fernandez, the attorney who filed the application on behalf of Deribeaux.\nLast year, Deribeaux scored county approval for a project up to eight-stories with 500 units, which would have consisted of 424 multifamily units and 76 townhomes, according to the application.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that you have a decrease in density like that,\u201d Fernandez said.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the townhomes will be for rent or for sale.\nDeribeaux didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nRecords show Deribeaux\u2019s entities paid a combined $2.2 million in three deals in 2018, 2021 and last year for the vacant lots. He is under contract to purchase the single-family home lot, Fernandez said.\nSouth Miami-Dade has become a magnet for developers due to its healthy supply of buildable land that sells at a discount from sites in Miami\u2019s urban core. Over the past half-decade, developers have seized on this, filing a flurry of proposed projects.\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar, which is the nation\u2019s second largest homebuilder, far outpaces its counterparts. It has delivered 8,430 single-family houses and townhomes in south Miami-Dade, or nearly\n70 percent\nof all such units built in the past five years, according to Colliers Research. Lennar also is developing almost 60 percent of the housing stock under construction.\nBrothers Salim and Kamil Chraibi\u2019s Miami-based Bluenest Development has emerged as one of the top workforce housing developers in south Miami-Dade. The firm\u2019s portfolio consists of 1,000 completed homes and a pipeline of\nanother 3,000\n.\nIn Princeton, one of south Dade\u2019s neighborhoods, Miami-based Paxton Development Group wants to develop the 230-unit\nLegacy Park\naffordable rental complex at 13850 Southwest 248th Street.\nAtlantic Pacific Companies and the Archdiocese of Miami proposed a\n600-unit affordable apartment complex\nat 28520 Southwest 148th Avenue, adjacent to St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Leisure City.\n",

        "content": "As developers continue to blame\nMeasure ULA\nfor choking multifamily construction across Los Angeles, more players are signing on to a renewed opposition campaign to the transfer tax.\nWhile developers are still confident in development in the region, the citywide tax has partially led many apartment developers to look outside L.A. city limits, coinciding with a dip in apartment construction overall, Bisnow\nreported\n. Now, a signature drive spearheaded by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to put a repeal measure on the November 2026 ballot is gaining momentum.\nDevelopers are \u201cvery much bullish on L.A. County, but not so much on the City of L.A., and it\u2019s a complex set of reasons,\u201d\nKamran Paydar\n, a CBRE broker and partner, told the publication. \u201cULA is a piece of it. Interest rates, which have risen, are also a big component, then add to that the different housing policies that are being supported by different municipalities.\u201d\nA University of California, Los Angeles, report this year found that approximately 1,900 units each year have gone unbuilt since the measure was adopted in 2023. Another study cited by Bisnow found that commercial transactions fell between 30 and 50 percent in the two years since Measure ULA\u2019s adoption. In 2022,\nLos Angeles permitted a total of 23,422 residential units\nthat count toward the state requirements for housing, or 5.1 percent of its state-mandated goal; by contrast, last year, the city permitted 17,195 residential units, or 3.8 percent of its state-ordered goal.\nSimply put, \u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing\u201d for developers, Chris Tourtellotte, managing director at LaTerra Development, previously\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nabout developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles. Many multifamily investors have followed suit and\nshifted their interests\noutside of the city, thereby depriving many developers of crucial funding. In the third quarter alone, fewer than 19,000 apartments were under construction in Los Angeles, representing a 30 percent drop from three years ago, per CoStar data\ncited\nby the Los Angeles Times.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California,\nsaid\nat\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable in September. \u201cIt\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial. It comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more.\u201d\nWhether Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association\u2019s Measure ULA opposition referendum makes it to the ballot remains to be seen. For now, the organization is\ncollecting\nsignatures to put the issue before voters next fall.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Anne M. Burke, the retired chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court and wife of disgraced former Ald. Ed Burke, bought a Lake Shore Drive condominium in Chicago for a little over $1 million.\nThe deal, recorded Nov. 12, marks a rare move outside the 14th Ward for a figure who has lived there since her husband first won office in 1969. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the deed lists only Anne Burke for the condo at 850 North Lake Shore Drive, with Ed Burke absent from the document. He was released in July from federal prison into community confinement after serving less than half of a 24-month sentence tied to his\nconviction\non 13 felony counts, including racketeering, bribery and extortion.\nThe sale record shows Anne Burke\u2019s prior address as the couple\u2019s custom home on 51st Street in Chicago, completed in the early 2000s and still owned by the pair. The property isn\u2019t publicly listed.\nA court spokesperson told the outlet that the couple are simply \u201ctwo older people looking to downsize to a smaller space.\u201d\nTheir new condo \u2014 a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with roughly 1,740 square feet \u2014 sits in a 19-story 1920s building that Florida-based multifamily developer\nCrescent Heights\nbegan converting to condos after buying it last year. The sale price amounts to about $580 per square foot. The structure\u2019s long, varied history includes stints as an elite athletic club and a Northwestern University dorm.\nThe move caps a storied legal and civic career for Anne Burke that began well before she entered the judiciary. She co-founded the\nSpecial Olympics\nin 1968 alongside Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a contribution later lauded by the American Academy for Park &amp; Recreation Administration as the \u201creal spark plug\u201d behind the program\u2019s launch. After becoming a lawyer in 1983, she rose quickly, becoming the first woman appointed to the Illinois Court of Claims in 1987 and later securing a seat on the state Supreme Court in 2006. She won two full terms and served as chief justice from 2019 to 2022 before retiring.\nHer husband, once one of Chicago\u2019s most powerful aldermen, was convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from\nstrong-arming developers\nfor legal work, pressuring business owners over permits and leaning on Field Museum officials for an internship for a child of one of his friends,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. His sentencing followed a decades-long run that shaped City Hall machine politics.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A beleaguered Far North Dallas office tower is getting a reset after landing a New York buyer with deep real estate lineage.\nArthur Zeckendorf and his firm, AZ Family Partners, placed the winning all-cash bid for Preston Plaza, a 10-story, 259,000-square-foot building on 6.3 acres at 17950 Preston Road that hit the auction block last month. The Nov. 10\u201312 auction, marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, began at $2.25 million, or $8.65 per square foot, though Zeckendorf didn\u2019t disclose his final offer. The deal is expected to close within two weeks,\naccording\nto the Dallas Business Journal. It will mark the firm\u2019s first office acquisition in the city.\nPreston Plaza\nhas been stuck in a financial spiral for years. With occupancy down to about 35 percent and losses mounting, a receiver signaled in mid-2024 that the property could be forced into a sale. Significant debt added pressure, and by late October the tower was being pitched as a redevelopment candidate with potential for apartments, a hotel or retail.\nZeckendorf\nisn\u2019t biting. He told the outlet that he plans to keep the 1980s building as offices, arguing Dallas \u2014 especially areas north of downtown \u2014 remains one of the strongest office markets in the country. He called the asset a long-term family investment and said the building\u2019s fundamentals, including its Preston Road frontage and proximity to Richardson, Addison and Plano, remain solid.\nThe tower last saw significant upgrades in 2015, including a refreshed lobby, conference center and fitness area. Now AZ Family Partners plans to inject another $10 million to $14 million into improvements, ranging from new office buildouts and elevator equipment to a redesigned lobby and potentially an on-site restaurant.\nZeckendorf\nhired Garrison Jones to lead a landscaping overhaul aimed at turning the sprawling parking area into something closer to a shaded park.\nThe firm also studied residential conversion costs, but determined a reset office strategy made more sense at the tower\u2019s current basis. Leasing will be handled by Dallas-based Forge Commercial, with a target occupancy of 75 percent to 80 percent.\nZeckendorf\ntold the outlet that he\u2019s seen early interest from family offices and law firms, giving him confidence that a stabilized owner with fresh capital can reposition the tower.\nThe upbeat posture mirrors broader bullishness around Dallas\u2019 fundamentals, as major employers expand and the Urban Land Institute again ranks Dallas\u2013Fort Worth the nation\u2019s top real estate market to watch.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Air rights transfers this year are\non track\nto reach the highest level seen since 2016, according to PropertyScout. The City of Yes allowed owners of landmarked properties to sell their development rights to more properties.\nCity Planning says that more than 12,000 homes resulting from office-to-residential conversions are in the pipeline, of which more than 3,000 are permanently affordable units. It\u2019s unclear how many of these changes are the direct result of City of Yes, though.\nCity of Yes created two new residential zoning districts, known as R11 and R12. These districts, when mapped, respectively allow residential floor area ratios of 15 and 18. So far, the districts have been used in the\nMidtown South\nrezoning, but have been proposed at individual sites, including at\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\nin Downtown Brooklyn and\na site above\nthe Second Avenue subway extension (which is coming up for a subcommittee and committee vote on Thursday).\nFriday also marks the end of a period in which projects were grandfathered in under certain rules that changed after City of Yes. For example, projects for which a permit application was filed before Dec. 5, 2024, and that the Department of Buildings approved before Dec. 5, 2025, can participate in the city\u2019s Voluntary Inclusionary Housing (VIH) program, rather than the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP).\nCity of Yes replaced the density bonus program VIH with UAP. The former provides a more generous density bump than UAP: VIH provides up to 3.5 square feet for every square foot of affordable space, while developers under UAP can only add as much space equal to the affordable square footage. The new program also requires deeper affordability.\nIn other words, there was an incentive to ensure your project is eligible for VIH.\nThe city\nreleased\napplications for UAP in April and\nopened\napplications for accessory dwelling units in September.\nAs I\u2019ve previously\nreported\n, developers are still figuring out how changes under City of Yes work with existing city programs and systems. It will be up to the next administration to oversee the continued rollout of the policies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you think has been the biggest effect of City of Yes so far?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nAirport lounges are in high demand. There are more than 3,500 airport lounges in the world,\naccording to the New Yorker\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNearly 100 bills hit Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s desk on Monday, meaning that she has until next Friday to act on the measures,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Including the 93 bills on her desk, Hochul has some 250 measures to act on.\n\u2014\nBrrrrrr! Temperatures in the city are forecasted to be in the upper 20s and lower 30s on Friday,\nGothamist reports\n. But, thanks to wind chill, it is going to feel like it is in the teens. Stay safe out there.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$40 million\nfor a 5,375-square-foot condominium unit at 443 Greenwich in Tribeca. Noble Black, Matthew B. Mackay and Cory Cahlon with Corcoran\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$133 million\nfor 115 West 40th Street in Midtown. Clarion Partners sold the 304,345-square-foot, 22-floor office building to AM Property Holding Corp.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$36 million\nfor an 8,800-square-foot condo at 445 Lafayette Street in Noho. Zack Sosne and Craig Roth with Next Stop NY have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 94,348-square-foot, 17-story residential building at 515 West 43rd Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Manish Chadha with Ismael Leyva Architects filed the permit on behalf of City Builders.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Months after\nputting it on the market\n, Blackstone found a buyer at the desired price point for The Shops at Skyview in Queens.\nA joint venture between TPG and Acadia Realty Trust is purchasing the Flushing retail complex for roughly $425 million, Bloomberg\nreported\n. That\u2019s the same price Blackstone reportedly sought when it first publicly marketed the property in July.\nA Newmark team of Adam Spies, Adam Doneger and Ben Lushing is representing Blackstone in the deal, which has not yet closed. None of the parties commented on the pending transaction.\nThe shopping center at 40-24 College Point Boulevard is anchored by a grocery store, spans 550,000 square feet and is almost fully leased.\nThe property features a pair of three-story buildings and a parking garage that fits more than 2,600 vehicles. It\u2019s part of a larger 3 million-square-foot complex that includes nearly 1,200 apartments and 50,000 square feet of medical space.\nTenants at the retail complex include BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Sky Zone, Marshalls, Sky Foods and Burlington. Late last year, Round1 Bowling &amp; Arcade\nsigned a lease\nfor 80,000 square feet.\nRoughly 184,000 square feet of leases were executed in the last year and a half; approximately 12 million people visit the complex annually.\nBlackstone bought the complex in 2015 from Onex Real Estate Partners for\n$400 million\n, making its first move into the Queens neighborhood. Onex constructed the 14-acre complex with original partner Muss Development, buying Muss out a year before the sale to Blackstone.\nIn 2021, Morgan Stanley originated\na $285 million loan\nfor the property, securitized into a single-asset commercial-mortgage-backed securities transaction. The refinancing replaced $306 million in existing debt provided by Morgan Stanley in 2016. Blackstone also agreed to contribute an additional $45 million in equity to the deal.\nTPG recently\nraised $2.1 billion\nfor its Real Estate Credit Opportunities fund, exceeding a $1.5 billion target. The fund has deployed $426 million worth of equity investments in more than a dozen assets across the country, mostly in the multifamily and industrial sectors.\nAs for Acadia, the Westchester-based firm sold 640 Broadway in Noho to German investor Pamera North America\nfor $49.5 million\nin September.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The company is planning hubs in Miami Executive Airport, Miami International Airport, Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, Boca Raton Airport, Palm Beach International Airport and Stuart Witham Field Airport.\nArcher will also utilize helipads at Ross\u2019\nHard Rock Stadium\nand his Apogee Golf Club. Vertiports, which are similar to helipads, are being planned in West Palm Beach, the Magic City Innovation District in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti and North Bay Village, according to a news release and published reports.\nThe longest routes in the planned network will take about 30 minutes, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nArcher plans to use its Midnight model in the South Florida network, which has seating for four passengers, a pilot and luggage. Pricing information isn\u2019t yet available, but was compared to pricing for high-end ride services like Uber Black by Archer\u2019s head of government affairs, Melissa McCaffrey. From Miami to West Palm Beach, that\u2019ll typically run about $200.\nIt\u2019s a service that could transform a growing region handicapped by gridlock traffic.\nWhen the network will be operational is dependent on approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has yet to certify Archer\u2019s air taxis for commercial use. Its eVTOL aircraft are the first new category considered by the FAA in almost 80 years.\nArcher is also planning air taxi networks in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Abu Dhabi.\nIt\u2019s not the only eVTOL maker targeting South Florida.

        "content": "End of an era? Maybe.\nHilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s sign has come off the Standard Oil building in Beverly Hills, with the high-end brokerage beginning a move to smaller offices within the city.\nThe relocation comes after the company\u2019s soon-to-be former landlord, Standard Oil Investment Group, took the brokerage to\ncourt\nover more than\n$650,000 in back rent\nand over $65,000 in late fees before asking a judge to toss the complaint last month.\nDespite the now-settled court drama, Hilton &amp; Hyland Chair Lori Hyland told\nThe Real Deal\nin a call Wednesday the move has nothing to do with the court case.\n\u201cWe have a very good relationship [with the landlord] and it has absolutely nothing to do with our business,\u201d she said of the decision to relocate.\nShe also slammed market chatter earlier this year that placed the brokerage on the sales block, waving off any consideration of a future deal.\n\u201cYou know\u2026 we live in a very, tight community,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beverly Hills all my life. I went to grammar school here. I know it very well. Everybody has something to say and it\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\nThe move could serve as a fresh start for the brokerage, which had inked a 10-year lease for 15,000 square feet at the Standard Oil Building at 257 North Canon Drive in 2015.\nIt moved into the building three years later.\nHyland said she expects the business to be shifted over to its new location at Maple Plaza at 345 North Maple Drive, and at full operations by Monday. The move shrinks Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s footprint to about 5,000 square feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just huge,\u201d Hyland said of offices it leaves behind on Canon Drive, \u201cand we don\u2019t need so much square footage. Nobody occupies that much space right now.\u201d\nThe brokerage counted over 100 agents and staffers when Hilton &amp; Hyland \u2014 founded by Hyland\u2019s late husband, Jeff Hyland, and Rick Hilton \u2014 moved into the Canon Drive office.\nIts roster is considerably smaller after years of\nagent departures\n.\nAs of Wednesday, California Department of Real Estate records show an agent and broker headcount of 25 licensed professionals.\nAmong the more recent exits was former Hilton &amp; Hyland President\nDavid Kramer\n, who decamped about a year ago to Compass, taking a\u00a0 six-person sales team with him.\u00a0 In April, former Hilton &amp; Hyland agent\nPaul Salazar\ntook three agents and an operations executive to Compass Beverly Hills. In August, broker\nSusan Pekich\nleft Hilton &amp; Hyland to join the Beverly Hills Estates.\nEven with the departures, Lori Hyland said she\u2019s intent on carrying on with the brokerage.\n\u201cI have taken Jeff\u2019s place as chairwoman of the company\u2013 I\u2019m not emeritus,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very much here, very much running the company and very much want to bring it into the future.

        "content": "A headline-grabbing lawsuit filed four years ago against a landlord that was formerly among Chicago\u2019s largest may have been centered on a faulty premise.\nThat\u2019s the rationale behind Pangea Properties\u2019 recent request for sanctions against attorneys representing a group of tenants in a class action complaint filed in 2022.\nIn their original filing, attorneys claimed that Pangea, led by Peter Martay, had allowed its portfolio of 423 properties to rack up \u201ctens of thousands of code violations,\u201d resulting in poor living conditions that violated tenant rights. At the time, the accusations made news and cast doubt on the quality of Pangea\u2019s properties.\nA few months later, the landlord\nsold its entire portfolio\nof more than 7,200 units in Chicago to a New York-based firm, Emerald Empire, for $600 million. The sale was the largest commercial transaction in Chicago in 2022.\nBecause Emerald Empire did not take over control of the properties until after the lawsuit was filed, it is not named in the complaint.\nYears into the litigation, Pangea argues that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have failed to provide sufficient evidence to back up their claims, despite the company turning over tens of thousands of documents during the discovery process.\n\u201cPlaintiffs admit that they cannot produce anything that substantiates their pleaded allegations that the properties had \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of violations. Still, plaintiffs unbelievably argue supporting [Department of Building] data exists, but they lack the technical skills to download and produce that data,\u201d the sanctions request reads.\nThe tenants\u2019 attorneys argue that they have not been able to properly analyze the records they have received during discovery and are also seeking additional documentation.\nPangea\u2019s attorneys claim that argument is likely more of a stall tactic than a legitimate rationale. They also claim that several requests from plaintiffs for substitute judges constitute another stall tactic known as \u201cjudge shopping.\u201d\nThe sanctions request goes on to add that the tenants are represented by \u201cthree different law firms, including a 1,200-attorney firm,\u201d and that \u201cit is implausible that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel lacks the technical ability to download a large data set from a public website.\u201d\nWhile disputing the trustworthiness of an allegation is typical in legal proceedings, the defendant\u2019s call for sanctions takes Pangea\u2019s defense to a new level. Not only are the company\u2019s attorneys claiming that the lawsuit is frivolous, they are also requesting that a judge essentially punish the tenants\u2019 attorneys for wasting the resources of the court system on a claim they allege the plaintiffs had no ability to back up from the beginning.\nThe attorneys representing the tenants work for Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath, Hughes Socol Piers Resnick &amp; Dym and The Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Family Services.\nThe sanctions request also notes that records provided by Pangea show that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s own documents indicated \u2026 the [Chicago Housing Authority] performed 7,300 inspections at the subject properties and \u2026 there were only 25 instances in which the CHA permanently terminated payments over the relevant 5.5 year time period. CHA routinely subsidizes defendants\u2019 apartments \u2026 and \u2018had a nearly 100 percent pass rate from HUD inspectors,\u2019\u201d according to one testimony.\nThe filing states that sanctions are necessary because of \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 disregard for the truth\u201d and \u201cpersistence with groundless litigation after warnings.\u201d\nIssuing the sanctions would \u201cprotect defendants from further harassment and the integrity of this court,\u201d the filing also states.\nAt one point, a judge in the tenant\u2019s class action lawsuit dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice but attorneys re-filed their claim shortly after.\nPangea\u2019s attorneys also argue that the sale of the portfolio for considerably more than it was bought for, was proof the company\u2019s properties were well taken care of.\nMartay began assembling the portfolio shortly after the great financial crisis, buying many properties for as little as $20,000 per unit. When he sold the properties in 2022, the price came out to about $75,000 per unit.\nA judge will consider the request for sanctions on December 15 and will hold a status call on December 23.\nPangea was also hit with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2018 over allegedly adding surcharges to units rented by HUD voucher holders. That case, however,\nwas dismissed in August.\nAny specific damages awarded to the federal government or the whistleblower were not outlined in the court filings.\nPreviously, Pangea denied committing fraud or systemic overcharging while admitting that there were some isolated cases of overcharging.\nAround the same time that the voucher dispute was dismissed, the portfolio\u2019s new owners, Emerald Empire, appeared to be running into trouble of their own.\nFannie Mae\nstruck a forbearance agreement\nin August with Moshe Wechsler\u2019s New York-based firm on at least $125 million worth of loans attached to Chicago apartment properties.\n\u201cThe loans in question are currently in forbearance and are performing in accordance with the agreement,\u201d a Fannie Mae spokesperson said at the time.\nAccording to public records, the properties in forbearance are encumbered by a tranche of debt within a bigger $430 million financing package.",

        "content": "Winnetka\u2019s ongoing fight over its fragile lakefront is back in federal court, with a group of homeowners alleging the village\u2019s 2024 bluff protection ordinance has already erased $16 million in property value across four high-end estates \u2014 and could ultimately cost hundreds of millions if applied across all 112 affected parcels.\nThe amended complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, includes more than two dozen plaintiffs, among them investors Andrew Bluhm, Michael Hara and Terry McKay, plus former executives from Abbott, United Airlines and other Chicago-area firms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The filing revives a suit\ndismissed in October\nfor lack of evidence of actual loss. This time, owners say they have the receipts: appraisals from Cohn Reznick showing steep value drops tied to the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.\nThe ordinance sharply limits how much blufftop land can be\ndeveloped\n, a response to years of public outcry over shoreline construction \u2014 a controversy amplified by billionaire\nJustin Ishbia\u2019s\n$77 million compound and its high-profile bluff reshaping. Homeowners insist the village has gone too far. Plaintiff organizer Bill Jackson, a retired Johnson Controls executive, told the outlet that the group doesn\u2019t want compensation, but rather to have the ordinance repealed.\nAmong the examples cited, Hara\u2019s Sheridan Road property allegedly lost nearly $4 million in value after roughly 10,000 square feet of buildable blufftop was eliminated, dropping the appraisal from $11.12 million to $7.31 million. The steepest hit \u2014 64 percent \u2014 was recorded at Barbara Irwin\u2019s estate on Taylorsport Lane, which fell from $7.54 million to $2.69 million after 17,700 square feet of land became off-limits.\nOwners argue the damage compounds over time: As Winnetka land prices rise, square footage removed from the buildable zone won\u2019t benefit from the\nappreciating market\n. They frame this as an unconstitutional taking under both the U.S. and Illinois constitutions, asserting the village has stripped land value without offering compensation.\nWinnetka\u2019s attorneys declined comment, citing the judge\u2019s order for plaintiffs to provide a black-lined comparison of the revised complaint. Village officials have defended the ordinance as necessary for safety and shoreline preservation, but plaintiffs say past permitting rules worked and that the new regime is driven by aesthetics, not geotechnical risk.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bonham, a quiet Fannin County town better known for its frontier history than major development, is bracing for its biggest growth spurt yet.\nA 400-acre site near State Highways 121 and 56 is set to become Powder Creek Ranch, the town\u2019s first master-planned community and a 3,000-home bet on North Texas\u2019 continued sprawl, 70 miles away from downtown Dallas.\nDallas-based Sanchez &amp; Associates will complete the project in seven phases through 2035, according to a press release. The mix mirrors what\u2019s driving demand across the region: single-family homes, townhomes, build-to-rent units and multifamily units, backed by a commercial spine of retail, dining and office space, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Parks, trails and open green networks aim to keep the development knitted to Bonham\u2019s small-town character.\nInfrastructure design is already underway for the 73-acre first phase, which will break ground in late 2026. That opening tranche will include 205 single-family homes and 350 BTR units, with rents between $1,200 and $2,200. Zillow puts Bonham\u2019s average home value at about $227,300, roughly $30,000 below that of Sherman and less than half of McKinney and Frisco.\nThat affordability, coupled with surging job hubs in\nSherman\nand northern\nCollin County\n, has accelerated Bonham\u2019s appeal to younger buyers and renters priced out of Dallas\u2019 inner ring. Commute times remain manageable, a quality of life advantage as traffic thickens along the region\u2019s major corridors.\n\u201cWith the tech boom happening in nearby\nGrayson County\nand continued growth into northern\nCollin County\n, Bonham continues to see increased attention from developers and employers,\u201d William Myers, the city\u2019s economic development director, told the Business Journal.\nThe Bonham City Council approved its first public improvement district last fall to help finance infrastructure for the decade-long buildout. Sanchez &amp; Associates CEO J. Martin Sanchez told the outlet that the project aims to honor the city\u2019s heritage while meeting the needs of \u201cfuture residents seeking attainable housing in the North Texas growth corridor.\u201d\nBonham, a town of roughly 10,500 residents, is one of Texas\u2019 oldest settlements. The town harkens back to an 1837 frontier blockhouse known as Fort Inglish. The Powder Creek Ranch site itself was part of a 1960s ranch owned by Joe Kirkpatrick, a World War II veteran and founder of Cisco Boots \u2014 history that Sanchez says will influence the community\u2019s design.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In a hush-hush deal, Austin philanthropist Ross Moody, scion of the influential Moody family, purchased a waterfront compound that includes a mid-century modern\nhome\nthat has never been sold before.\nThrough an LLC which he manages, and which has its address at another of his properties, Moody bought the neighboring houses at 3925 and 3919 Westlake Drive on\nLake Austin\nand a vacant lot across the street at 3809 Spirit Lake Cove, according to county records. Altogether, the property includes 550 feet of waterfront and 3 acres of land.\nAlthough each property has its own address and identification, all were owned by one seller, and the survey on the listing website for the home at 3925 Westlake yokes them under one border. Amy Deane with Moreland Properties had the listing. The listing and sales prices are unavailable.\nThe marquee home is at 3925 Westlake, which Deane likens to a \u201cyacht wrapped around the hills.\u201d Built in 1963 for the seller, physician Donald Counts, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 3,200-square-foot house blends into the wooded cliffside with stone, redwood and patinate copper as its primary materials. It shares a 2-acre lot with a boat house, a garden nursery and two other family dwellings, according to county information and the listing survey.\nThe property made headlines in January as Austin\u2019s most expensive active listing,\nasking $19.9 million, or about $988 per square foot over the 20,100 square feet of gross living space on the lot. The seller reduced the price to $17.5 million in September, according to Zillow.\nThe rest of the property is just as luxurious, though not quite as flashy.\nNeither Redfin, Zillow nor Realtor.com record any listing history for the home at 3919 Westlake. Deane created a listing website which invites visitors to inquire about pricing.\nThe 1-acre property includes a 6,000-square-foot house built in 1971 with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, overlooking the water from a cliff. Counts acquired it in 2006.\nInformation on the property at 3809 Spirit Lake Cove, the unimproved half-acre lot across the street, is similarly scant.\nAs a result, one can only estimate the total asking price of the 3-acre property, much less the final sale price. However, the $17.5 million asking price for the home at 3925 Westlake is more than double its net appraised value of $7.4 million, and the three parcels have a combined appraised value of $12.6 million, property records show.\nPrivate listings and sales are common in Austin\n, most practically as a way to evade higher property tax appraisals.\nMoody is a trustee of the Moody Foundation, the Galveston-based charitable organization founded in 1942 by financier William Lewis Moody. The Moodys endowed the Moody Gardens and the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas, and they are the namesake of UT\u2019s Moody Center and SMU\u2019s Moody Coliseum.\n",

        "content": "Hobe Sound, just north of Palm Beach County\u2019s golf mecca Jupiter, has emerged as a hotspot for developers looking to build the next generation of exclusive\ngolf developments\n.\nThe golf community is hardly a new real estate phenomenon. Done well, they become prestigious luxury mini-markets.\nHeavy hitters like billionaire Related Ross chairman Steve Ross and Discovery Land Company\u2019s Mike Meldman, best known for building the Yellowstone Club in Montana, are among the developers with skin in the Hobe Sound game.\nMichael Jordan, famously a resident of\nJupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club\n, turned to Hobe Sound for his own golf development.\nGrove XXIII\n, named for his number 23 jersey, doesn\u2019t have a residential component but has attracted a stacked roster of high-profile members. A leaked membership list obtained by Golf Digest in 2021 includes Mark Wahlberg, Bret Baier, Wayne Gretzky, and golfers Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy. From the real estate industry were Meldman and Frisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell.\nThe result is a pipeline of hundreds of luxury homes and thousands of acres soon to become immaculate greens.\nFlorida is a well-established golf destination. The National Golf Foundation counts more than 1,200 golf courses in Florida, more than any other state. The\npandemic\ninspired many Americans to take up golf and\npursue private club membership\n. It also triggered a wave of migration to South Florida, and developers responded in kind, planning thousands of luxury single-family homes and condos.\nThat includes luxury golf club communities like Centaur Holdings\u2019\nPanther National\nnear Palm Beach Gardens, a 218-home development with an 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus and Justin Thomas. But much of the open land in Palm Beach County has already been cannibalized, and land prices have soared.\nSo developers went north. Here\u2019s a look at the planned golf developments in Hobe Sound.\nApogee |\n2103 Southwest Bridge Road |\nDevelopers: Related Ross, Michael Pascucci\nSteve Ross teamed up with Michael Pascucci, the chairman of investment firm Duck Pond Associates and owner of the Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, to develop Apogee. The private club will have three 18-hole courses when it is completed. While there are no homes for sale, the club does have a residential component. Apogee will have 54 villas ranging between two- and four-bedrooms, for member use only.\nRoss announced this week that Apogee will be part of a South Florida\nair taxi network\n, as part of a partnership with Archer Aviation.\nAtlantic Fields | 2645 Southeast Bridge Road | Developers: Discovery Land Company, Becker Holding Corporation\nAtlantic Fields is Discovery\u2019s first project on Florida\u2019s east coast, developed in partnership with the Becker brothers\u2019 Becker Holding Corporation. The 1,500-acre project includes 317 single-family homes, an 18-hole golf course, equestrian facilities, a farm and other recreation and wellness amenities, according to the website.\nThe Ranch | 4505 Southwest Kanner Highway | Developer: Ken Bakst\nHistorically known as the Calusa Creek Ranch, this 3,900-acre development is slated for 175 single-family homes and two 18-hole courses, according to the project\u2019s website. The developer is Ken Bakst, who built the Friar\u2019s Club on Long Island.\n",

To land the three-year extension on the $151.5 million CMBS loan, Chetrit pumped in additional equity, which subordinates part of the debt.\nIron Hound Management\u2019s Kevin Thompson and Will Forbes negotiated the deal with special servicer CW Capital and a CMBS trust.\n\u201cWe believe in a positive future for this asset going forward,\u201d Michael Chetrit told the Observer.\nThe 65 Broadway debt landed in special servicing in February 2024 after tenants, including Great American Insurance and New York Cares, exited the property.\nThe loan was flagged in April 2024 for maturity default as cash flow failed to cover loan payments, according to Trepp. The former American Express Building was subsequently reappraised at $104 million, half of the value from five years prior and below the loan balance.\nBy last June, however, Chetrit and its co-sponsor were able to bring the payments current, according to Fitch commentary from July 2024. There were signs an extension was in the offing as Chetrit pursued a plan to offer additional equity, which is ultimately what went down.\nThe building is 110 years old and was last renovated in 2018, before the pandemic altered tenant expectations around amenities and customized space. The building was 35 percent vacant as of July 2024.\nThis is the second significant restructuring to cross the finish line for the Chetrit Organization in recent weeks.\nLast month, the firm modified the\n$714 million debt\nbacking the Yorkshire Towers at 305 East 86th Street and Lexington Towers at 160 East 88th Street on the Upper East Side. The\nmodification\nbrought the CMBS loan current, waived guarantees in the original deal and pushed back the loan\u2019s maturity date.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Horton slated the project for a 7.2-acre site at 530 Southwest Third Avenue, 354 Southwest Seventh Street and two adjacent lots, according to the developer\u2019s application filed to Miami-Dade County late last month.\nThe homebuilder is under contract to purchase the four-lot property at an undisclosed price, the application says.\nThe Torcise family, longtime farmers in the Florida City area, own the site, according to records.\nThe project would consist of two-story buildings with five- to 12 townhomes, the site plan shows.\nLed by CEO Paul J. Romanowski, D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder nationwide.\nThe firm has been a home developer for years in south Miami-Dade, an area with an ample supply of cheaper buildable land.\nOver the past five years, D.R. Horton completed 16 percent of all single-family homes and townhomes built in south Miami-Dade, according to Colliers Research. D.R. Horton also is responsible for\n23 percent\nof the under-construction and proposed pipeline in the area.\nElsewhere in south Miami-Dade, the firm plans a complex with\n190 townhomes and 57 single-family homes\non the southwest corner of Southwest 344th Street and 193rd Avenue. The site is in an unincorporated area of the county.\nDevelopers have rushed to south Miami-Dade over the past half-decade in a bid to scoop up and build on one of the area\u2019s many vacant lots. The flurry of project proposals is partly rooted in the influx of out-of-staters to South Florida, which supercharged the tri-county region\u2019s housing market and created high demand for homes.\nAlso in Florida City, Lennar plans a\n521-unit townhome\ncomplex on the southwest corner of Southwest 167th Avenue and Southwest 344th Street. Garrett Development, a land bank for Lennar, paid $20.4 million for the 37.8-acre development site last year.\nIn April, Boston-based Freehold Capital Management bought the 50-acre land assemblage on the southeast corner of Southwest 344th Street and Southwest 199th Avenue near Florida City for\n$31.6 million\n. The site was previously planned for a 309-unit rental townhome project.\n",

        "content": "When the\nAstor Place Starbucks closed\nin 2024 after nearly 30 years, it left a hole in a busy East Village commercial strip \u2014 and in the pocket of the Gindi family.\nThe value of the commercial condo at 21 Astor Place has dropped 72 percent in a decade, from $42 million to $11.7 million, according to Morningstar Credit. The owner, an entity connected to Isaac and Edward Gindi, is currently\nbattling foreclosure\n.\nA company now associated with the Gindis bought the commercial condo for $13 million in 2004, according to city records. Ownership interests appear to have transferred several times, but in 2015, Isaac and Edward sponsored a $26.65 million refinancing loan for the location.\nTrouble began a few years later in 2021, when FedEx vacated more than 60 percent of its space in the commercial condo, which extends around the south side of the building on Astor Place. Revenue fell by about 40 percent from 2020 to 2021, according to information from Morningstar.\nDoorDash moved in swiftly to occupy the 6,000-square-foot space, lured by 90 days of free rent. That kept the property full, but rents were still lower than their peak, according to the loan servicer.\nStarbucks had signed a 20-year lease for just over 4,000 square feet at the condo, across the street from the \u201cCube\u201d sculpture, in 2004. The site quickly became a case study for the area\u2019s changing demographics.\n\u201cEast Village grit is giving way to Midtown-style blandness,\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nwrote in 2007\n, when Starbucks renewed another lease down the street.\nBut the coffee chain closed the Astor Place location last year.\n\u201cIt was a gentrifier that the neighborhood grew to accept pretty quickly,\u201d Curbed\neulogized\nafter the announcement. \u201cIt found its audience in a million NYU-freshman-year study dates.\u201d\nThe withdrawal of Starbucks triggered a requirement for the borrower to deposit $1.5 million in the lender\u2019s account, something it failed to do, the lender alleges in a July foreclosure suit. The Gindis, who served as limited guarantors on the loan, allegedly failed to submit documentation about their net worth and liquidity.\n\u201cThe vacancy at 21 Astor stems from high taxes, complex landmark regulations and lengthy municipal approvals,\u201d Terrance and Darren Oved, the Gindis\u2019 counsel of Oved &amp; Oved LLP, said in a statement. \u201cOur client is actively addressing these challenges and remains confident in securing a suitable tenant for the space and the community.\u201d\nThe court appointed a temporary receiver to the property on Friday.\n",

        "content": "Would you pay $773,000 for an apartment in Syracuse, where the median home costs one-fourth as much?\nNew York state is doing just that.\nThe state just broke ground on\nEast Adams Phase I\n, a $102 million, 132-unit affordable housing development on public land in Syracuse. That\u2019s $773,000 per unit \u2014\nabout as much\nas it would have cost in New York City.\nHowever, that per-unit cost would be much easier to justify in New York City, where half of all homes sell for\nmore than $845,000\n. In Syracuse,\nnot a single house\nis selling for that much.\nThe median asking price for the 783 Syracuse homes listed at\nRealtor.com\nis $195,000. At that price, the $102 million being spent to build Phase I\u2019s 117 apartments and four townhomes could have purchased 523 homes.\nI realize that the $102 million could not legally have been spent that way, because the development\u2019s funding streams cannot be used to buy free-market homes. Also, it\u2019s an inexact comparison because many of the existing houses need some work and operating costs for the new, all-electric rentals and townhouses will be lower.\nBut you have to admit, the 4x cost differential is huge. From a capacity perspective, 523 homes would house about 1,500 more people than the 132 will.\nIt\u2019s just hard to wrap your brain around the project\u2019s $773,000 per-unit cost when this gorgeous five-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom, 3,700-square-foot house, also in Syracuse, is listed for only $439,900:\nDid I mention that the house includes a two-car garage?\nThe new development, East Adams Phase I, is replacing McKinney Manor, a to-be-demolished public housing complex with $17 million in deferred maintenance. East Adams will house tenants earning 60 percent of the area median income. Project-based Section 8 vouchers administered by the Syracuse Housing Authority will support 63 of the units.\nThe rest of the funding is coming from state and federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits ($42 million in equity and $45 million in subsidy from HCR) and Empire State Development (an $8 million subsidy loan). There\u2019s also $2.1 million from HUD, $500,000 from city bonds and $400,000 from Onondaga County.\nOnly in fantasy land could these funds be used to buy and convert private homes to public housing. That said, if it makes sense for the government to spend $773,000 per unit on East Adams Phase I, it surely makes sense for it to pay $6,000 for this attractive, four-bedroom\nfixer-upper\nwith original detail and rehabilitate it.\nGovernment housing wonks might call this analysis nonsense. I acknowledge that there is not a binary choice between building the East Adams project and buying existing homes.\nIndividuals, house-flippers and investors will eventually purchase the listed homes and fix those that need fixing, so the government need not do that. Meanwhile, if the government doesn\u2019t build East Adams, no one will. The purpose of government is to do things that are needed but don\u2019t happen on their own. I get all that.\nStill, it\u2019s hard to make sense of paying New York City prices to build affordable housing upstate, where homes are dirt cheap.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council is moving toward complying with California\u2019s new\nstate-mandated transit-oriented development\nlaw.\nThe City Council earlier this week voted unanimously to approve a set of recommendations that kicks off the city\u2019s work to comply with SB 79, the Los Angeles Daily News\nreported\n. The\ntransit-area housing law\nis slated to take effect next July.\nCity staff are now authorized to begin detailed mapping and modeling of where SB 79\u2019s new density and height standards would be permitted. The Department of City Planning will do so by getting software and technical support for the effort, while the City Administrative Officer has been directed to find up to $375,000 in General Fund money for the citywide analysis. The visualization effort is being billed as a way to help officials determine which parts of town could qualify for delayed implementation of the law, as well as where a locally tailored alternative plan could increase density in certain areas rather than others.\nUnder SB 79,\nsigned into law\nby Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, California cities must allow mid- to high-density housing within a half-mile of certain rail stations and major bus routes. In Los Angeles, about 150 locations could be eligible under the law.\nSB 79 comes with two methods of determining how the law can be implemented.\n\u201cDelay in effectuation\u201d allows for a temporary pause that the city can use in certain areas deemed eligible. The \u201c\ntransit-oriented development\n(TOD) alternative plan,\u201d or \u201cAlt Plan,\u201d permits the city to move where dense projects can be built as long as housing capacity isn\u2019t decreased. The city is tasked with extensive modeling and securing state approval under both methods.\nBoth options have their own limits, some planning officials have warned. Many low-density neighborhoods with increased access to jobs and schools will likely not qualify for the delay. Alt Plans, meanwhile, present the issue of identifying another place to build if developers opt to reduce capacity on certain parcels.\nCity officials plan to present initial findings for the effort early next year. Any delay ordinance or Alt Plans must be submitted to the state housing department in the first quarter in order for them to take effect before SB 79 kicks in on July 1.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Crescent Heights\nis moving closer toward making its planned 67-story residential tower in downtown San Francisco.\nThe Miami-based developer is in motion on its planned $1 billion project at 10 South Van Ness Avenue as it consults with construction, design and engineering teams on a path forward, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The 1,000-unit tower could begin construction by early 2027, opening for occupancy amid what\u2019s expected to be a hot market for\nresidences as the number of artificial intelligence jobs\ncontinues to grow in the city.\nThe progress on the project marks a thawing in the high-rise construction pipeline that has largely been frozen due to pricey construction and costly debt. If Crescent Heights makes it happen, it could be the first major developer to build a high-rise residential tower in San Francisco\u2019s recent supply-restricted market.\nRising rents in San Francisco could explain why the project is inching closer to actually being built. Rents in the city increased 4.6 percent year-over-over, representing the third-fastest jump in the country, per Apartment List data cited by the Business Times. As a result, financial models have also improved, thanks in part to increased investor confidence, construction costs decreasing between 5 and 10 percent from their peak, and an easing on borrowing costs. Case in point:\nEquity Residential\nrecently told its investors that the recovery of downtown San Francisco is picking up steam as workers return, occupancies increase and rents approach pre-pandemic levels.\nAs it stands, investor-driven lenders make up 30 percent of construction loans, while regional banks have fallen to 25 percent. Office and apartment starts are still notably down from a year ago, signaling that capital isn\u2019t quite ready to dive head-first back into the market.\nStill, other developers are also charging ahead with their plans for downtown San Francisco. Lincoln Property Company, for example, is moving forward with its proposal for about 370 residential units as part of a mixed-use redevelopment located\non the campus of Golden Gate University\n.\nLocal officials are hoping to help speed up the process. On Tuesday, city supervisors approved a rezoning plan that increases housing capacity by 36,200 units. Officials also recently waived impact fees in the city\u2019s Hub and Market-Octavia districts, which is where Crescent Heights\u2019 tower would be built. Moves like these should, in theory, lower upfront costs so approved projects can actually get started.\n\u201cWe are doing all of this work to be better able to deliver what our public needs,\u201d Leigh Lutenski, the director of development for the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Crow developed the 1,610-room landmark at 2201 North Stemmons Freeway that anchors the Design District skyline with its pyramid-topped tower in the late 1970s as part of the Dallas Market Center complex, opening the 52-acre property in 1979 as the Loews Hotel.\nToday, the Anatole is a sprawling convention host establishment with two atriums, an\nAsian art collection\ntopping 1,000 works\u2013amenities that helped cement its place as one of the city\u2019s most important meeting hubs.\nThe renovation plan is ambitious.

The work also covers a slate of additional capital projects, though details weren\u2019t disclosed.\nIt follows a $30 million update launched in mid-2023 that reimagined about 700 rooms and nudged the hotel\u2019s key count slightly higher. Before that, a $125 million renovation in 2010 helped the Anatole keep pace with Dallas\u2019 growing profile as a corporate and\nconvention\ndestination.\nThe Anatole\u2019s long history as a civic gathering point adds weight to the latest reboot. It has played a key role accommodating everything from national political events \u2014 including the 1984 Republican National Convention and CPAC in 2021 \u2014 to The Real Estate Council\u2019s annual Fight Night. Its top-floor restaurant, S\u0112R Steak + Spirits, and its museum-like public spaces have also helped the property maintain relevance as newer hospitality concepts crowd the market.\nCrow Holdings CFO Ian Dilley said in a news release that the improvements will ensure the Anatole \u201cremains a defining destination for Dallas for generations to come,\u201d noting its role as a backdrop for corporate groups, tourists and community events.\nThe two companies framed the renewed agreement as a continuation of their goal to keep the Anatole positioned as a world-class destination. Rooms currently start around $269 a night.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Taconic acquired the former 100-key hotel from Merchants Capital in May 2021 for approximately\n$38.4 million\n, three years after Merchants acquired it for $32.3 million.\nTaconic lent Merchants $38 million at the property in 2019, allowing it to swoop in for its acquisition two years later.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Palette has planned for the site; the company and Taconic both failed to respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe site was once the home of Z NYC, a trendy spot in the Queens neighborhood. But like so many of its hospitality counterparts in New York, it couldn\u2019t outrun the effects of the pandemic and closed in 2020.\nHospitality startup Sonder stepped into the void, agreeing to lease the entire property. It ultimately backed out of the deal, however, leading Merchants to sue the company for $2.5 million for allegedly breaching the contract. Sonder went bankrupt last month.\nRichard Lou formerly ran a chain of restaurants before diving into the hotel market two decades ago. The Lou family acknowledged its changing business model in 2023 when it christened its business as Palette Hotels.

A deal was ultimately announced before the calendar flipped.\nElsewhere in Long Island City hospitality, the McSam Hotel Group sold a 142-key property at 38-04 11th Street last year\nfor $40 million\n.

        "content": "A combined $755 million in Chicago office transactions closed Tuesday shows trophy assets still commanding big-league valuations while older towers push deeper into distressed territory.\nOwners of the Bank of America Tower locked in the headline move, completing a $700 million refinancing on the 55-story riverfront skyscraper at 110 North Wacker Drive. Built in 2020, the roughly 1.5 million-square-foot property was recently appraised at just over $1 billion, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe contrast came a few blocks south, where Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management closed on 190 South LaSalle Street, a 40-story postmodern tower designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee and built in 1987. The Great Neck, New York-based firms, known for scooping up distressed assets nationwide, paid about $55 million \u2014 that\u2019s about $69 per square foot, people familiar with the deal told the outlet \u2014 a fraction of the $230 million Beacon Capital Partners spent on the 798,000-square-foot building in 2019.\nBeacon\u2019s exit from\n190 South LaSalle\nmarks a steep plunge from the tower\u2019s pre-pandemic financing. The sale price sits far below the $167.5 million loan Beacon took out in February 2020. U.S. Bank, the lender and a tenant in the high-vacancy building, declined to comment, as did the buyers and Beacon. The sale was brokered by Cushman and Wakefield\u2019s Cody Hundermark and Tom Sitz.\nMeanwhile, Callahan Capital Partners and Oak Hill Advisors touted the refinancing of\nBank of America Tower\nas evidence that capital markets still reward best-in-class assets. Since buying the controlling interest in 2022, the owners have pushed occupancy from 78 percent to 98 percent, helping secure one of Chicago\u2019s largest post-pandemic office financings. Only the Old Post Office and Salesforce Tower have landed bigger CMBS deals in recent years.\nRiverfront skyscrapers and newer top-tier offices have kept reeling in the city\u2019s highest rents and biggest loans, while aging towers struggle with vacancies, debt loads and changing tenant preferences. It\u2019s a pattern playing out in other major U.S. markets too, where trophy buildings continue to attract capital even as older stock trades at liquidation prices.\nSome Chicago real estate pros see opportunity in the discount era. More trades at reset values, they argue, could draw in buyers with lower cost bases capable of competing for leases, ultimately adding liquidity to the market in 2026 and beyond. Namdar and Mason fit that profile: the pair have already snapped up\n70 West Madison\nand\nOne North LaSalle\nthrough similar distressed asset moves.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Atherton\u2019s hottest commodities aren\u2019t the palatial homes housing some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest players, but the land on which they sit.\nA property at 123 Stockbridge Avenue in West Atherton, for example, fetched $9.5 million in October \u2014 a steal\nby Atherton standards\n\u2014 as a\nteardown\n, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The buyer\u2019s identity has not been disclosed.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s land value,\u201d said Gina Haggerty, the Compass listing agent who also represented the buyers. \u201cThe home had no significant value to it.\u201d\nThe nearly 1.2-acre lot attracted 14 offers and interest from developers and buyers looking to build their dream home.\nIt hit the market Oct. 1, asking under $8 million, and was in contract two weeks later. The property was in distress, as the previous owner owed nearly $5 million on a 2017 loan on the property. A notice of a trustee sale had been published, and the fast turnover and relatively low sale price was likely due to sellers wanting to avoid a\nforeclosure sale\n, said Ken DeLeon, founder of Palo Alto-based DeLeon Realty.\nA home at 57 Fairview Avenue also recently sold for its land value.\nThe 1-acre property was listed for $7.8 million and sold last month for $10.7 million, almost a third more than the price of a comparable lot last year.\n\u201cEven I was surprised that it jumped so much higher than just last year,\u201d DeLeon said.\nDeLeon\u2019s clients have been spending between $2,200 and $2,600 per square foot on construction costs for new builds on\nteardown\nlots. A typical 20,000-square-foot estate will run the teardown buyers almost $50 million in addition to the $10 million lot.\n\u201cThe lack of supply of good Atherton lots, coupled with increased demand due to [artificial intelligence] liquidity, will drive the luxury market to new heights next year,\u201d DeLeon said.\nThat prediction is held among many observers who\u2019ve noted the uptick in luxury home sales over the past year, including Haggerty. \u201cPeople are feeling more confident in buying a big property,\u201d she said.\nAs more\nAI companies\nand wealthy people move into the region, competition for such properties has increased \u2014 so much so that San Francisco is experiencing an\nAI-related mansion shortage\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lennar\nswitched land banks for 423 homesites in the Keys Gate residential subdivision in\nHomestead\nin a $24 million deal.\nJEN Partners\n, a New York-based firm that\u2019s served as a land bank for Lennar, sold the lots to DW Partners, also based in New York, according to records. The purchase price was $23.98 million.\nAs part of the deal, Lennar terminated its purchase option for the homesites with JEN and signed a purchase option agreement with DW Partners that\u2019s valid until 2031, records show.\nThe lots are roughly south of Southwest 344th Street and east of Southwest 162nd Avenue.\nDW Partners\n, led by David Warren and Robert Clark, is an alternative asset manager founded in 2009, according to its website.\nMiami-based Lennar, the second largest homebuilder nationwide and the\nbiggest in south Miami-Dade County\n, heavily relies on land banks to secure development sites years before it\u2019s ready to start building homes on them. The strategy allows the publicly traded Lennar to carry the cost of the land ownership off its balance sheet, freeing up its cash flow for developing homes, experts have said.\nAside from JEN, Lennar\u2019s other land bank partners include Scottsdale, Arizona-based Garrett Development and New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon. This year, the homebuilder also spun off\nMillrose Properties\n, its own publicly traded land bank.\nLennar is led by Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe.\nJaffe will retire\nfrom the firm this year.\nLocking in development sites in advance is also advantageous for Lennar in Miami-Dade due to the county\u2019s low supply of buildable sites. The south county area is the only remaining part of Miami-Dade with enough land for single-family and townhome communities.\nOver the past five years, developers have rushed to south Miami-Dade, scooping up sites and filing new project applications. Lennar has outpaced them all, completing nearly 70 percent of the homes finished in the area since 2020, according to Colliers Research. It also is developing 60 percent of the pipeline.\nAlso within the massive Keys Gate subdivision, Lennar filed a proposal in 2022 for\n1,335 homes\nand a golf course on 350 acres.\nOthers with stakes in Keys Gate include Miami-based Mast Capital, which paid\n$50.8 million\nfor a 292-townhome complex in 2021. The property is at 1140 Southeast 24th Road.\nOthers developing in south Miami-Dade include Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s biggest homebuilder. In Florida City, it proposed a\n108-townhome complex\nat 530 Southwest Third Avenue, 354 Southwest Seventh Street and two adjacent lots.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra wants to redevelop a portion of the South Dade Government Center at 10710, 10750 and 10800 Southwest 211th Street in Cutler Bay with a\n724-unit Live Local Act project\n. The first phase would consist of a pair of eight-story buildings with about 362 units and 458 parking spaces.\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump wiped away the federal case against Tim Leiweke, the powerhouse executive who helped build Oak View Group into a worldwide sports and entertainment venue developer.\nLeiweke\n, who stepped down as Oak View Group\u2019s CEO after his July indictment, was pardoned Dec. 2, according to a notice posted to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s website the following evening, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Leiweke had faced a single felony count of restraining trade tied to OVG\u2019s ultimately successful pursuit of a deal to develop the Moody Center arena at the University of Texas main campus in Austin.\nLeiweke is well known nationally for his years spent working for billionaire Philip Anschutz and Los Angeles-based AEG Worldwide, which owns the\nCrypto.com\narena and the Los Angeles Kings hockey club along with other venues around the U.S. and world. Leiweke later played a similar role with the Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment in Toronto before joining with music industry veteran Irv Azoff to form Oak View Group, which operates a roster of facilities ranging from the UBS Arena in New York to the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago and several Texas properties also in the mix.\nProsecutors alleged he conspired with Legends Hospitality in 2018 to rig the bidding, convincing a rival firm to back off in exchange for future contracts once the Austin venue opened. If convicted, he faced up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.\nThe pardon arrives five months after the indictment forced Leiweke \u2014 one of the most recognizable operators in sports and entertainment real estate \u2014 to relinquish the CEO role at the Denver-based firm he co-founded.\nOak View Group\nsecured non-prosecution agreements in the case, paying a $15 million fine, while Legends paid $1.5 million. Leiweke consistently maintained his innocence, arguing that collaborating on the bid was a standard strategy for a young company competing for marquee projects.\nLeiweke\nexpressed deep gratitude to\nTrump\nin a statement to Sports Business Journal, calling the case a \u201clong and difficult journey\u201d for his family. A jury trial had been scheduled for May 4 after being pushed from an initial December date.\nThe timing wasn\u2019t subtle. Hours before the pardon became public, Oak View Group formally named veteran sports executive Chris Granger its permanent CEO. Granger had been serving in an interim capacity since Leiweke\u2019s departure and is now tasked with steadying a company that has ballooned into a global powerhouse, managing and developing arenas, stadiums and live-entertainment districts across North America and abroad.\nOak View Group struck a supportive note in a statement to SBJ, saying it was \u201chappy for Tim that he can now put this matter behind him\u201d while emphasizing its focus on clients under Granger\u2019s leadership. The company opened and operates the Moody Center, which has become a major anchor for Austin\u2019s live-events economy since debuting in 2022.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The two allege their niece and nephew were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother.\nThe brother named as a culprit in the suit is Haresh Jogani, who was\nordered\nin 2024 to pay plaintiffs Rajesh and Chetan Jogani, and their other brothers, to settle a two-decade dispute over the family\u2019s portfolio of 17,000 or so apartment units in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles; the payout verdict was valued at about $10 billion.\nNow Rajesh and Chetan Jogani claim their brother made payments to his children \u2014 the niece and nephew of the plaintiffs \u2014 in order to siphon off and hide assets from real estate management and diamond businesses, according to a complaint dated late-November, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\nThe current accusations are flying as the prior case is in the courts on appeal.\nThe first\nlegal brawl\nended with Haresh being ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan a combined $1.5 billion in punitive damages. Rajesh and Chetan also were awarded punitive damages and a 10 percent and six and a half percent stake, respectively, in the\nmultifamily real estate portfolio\nthat was at the center of the case.\nA total of five Jogani brothers came to Los Angeles from India, and eventually amassed a fortune in real estate and diamonds.\nThe latest complaint claims Jeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani \u2014 Haresh\u2019s children and the nephew and niece of Rajesh and Chetan \u2014 together received $225 million \u201clooted\u201d from three real estate entities. The case contends that all brothers own the businesses.\nThe two plaintiffs contend that a court-appointed receiver gave Haresh \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the businesses for a period of time, leading to illegitimate payments to his children.\n\u201cHaresh treated the partnership companies as his personal piggy bank,\u201d the complaint alleges, and \u201ctook advantage of his position, to loot billions of dollars, without making proportionate distributions to his brothers.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan claim their niece and nephew held roles at the three real estate entities before a receiver terminated them. The two brothers argue that neither performed substantial work or contributed to profitability, that they received $25 million bonuses in the middle of the prior trial. The two brothers claim the monetary transfers exceed reasonable compensation, and that Haresh allowed them to \u201chinder and delay plaintiffs\u2019 ability to collect the amounts that Haresh owes to them.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan allege the \u201cdefendants\u2019 conduct was malicious, oppressive, and done with the intent to defraud.\u201d\nThe two are suing for treble damages, a legal remedy where the court is required to award the plaintiff three times the amount of actual damages determined by the jury as punitive measure. In this case, the actual damages are $225 million, per the suit, therefore treble damages amount to $775 million.\nJeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani could not be immediately reached for comment. The two do not appear to have retained attorneys based on available information.\nTheir father Haresh\u2019s prior attorney, Rick Richmond, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Ross, an attorney who represented Rajesh and Chetan in the prior case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A long-stalled Arlington Heights apartment development just bought itself another year.\nVillage trustees approved a 12-month extension this week for zoning approvals tied to Mylo Arlington Heights, a six-story, 135-unit project that has been unable to break ground since securing entitlements in 2022. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the reprieve keeps the plan alive at\n116-120 West Eastman Street\n, where two obsolete office buildings \u2014 including one with a basement that once housed the 1960s teen club called The Cellar \u2014 have sat vacant on the edge of the village\u2019s downtown.\nDeveloper\nJoe Taylor\nIII of Compasspoint Development said the hurdles holding up the $66 million transit-oriented project are the same ones dogging multifamily proposals across the Chicago suburbs. Interest rates have pushed banks and debt funds to retreat from construction lending. Equity investors are hesitant too, Taylor said, because they can pick up existing northwest suburban apartment buildings at or below replacement cost. And construction pricing continues to rise, strained by higher materials costs, a tight labor pool and uncertainty around tariffs and inflation.\nEven so, Taylor told trustees he expects 2026 to be the year that it finally becomes realistic to see shovels dig in the dirt on West Eastman. The new zoning deadline requires Compasspoint to secure permits and begin construction by December 18, 2026.\nThe plan calls for a midrise building with a ground-floor restaurant and a renter base ranging from young professionals to local downsizers \u2014 a demographic mix\nArlington Heights\nhas been courting as redevelopment clusters near its Metra train station.\nTaylor said the extension provides enough runway to finalize design, engineering and construction pricing by the second quarter of 2026, with delivery and lease-up targeted for 2028.\nTrustee Tom Schwingbeck pressed him on whether that\u2019s achievable. Taylor insisted it is.\n\u201cI don\u2019t envision us coming back for a second time for a second extension,\u201d Taylor said at the meeting. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get everything done.\u201d\nMuch of his confidence stems from new capital partners. Taylor said he has teamed up with Richard Wolper, founder of Utah-based luxury homebuilder Mark 25 Homes, who in turn has long-standing financing relationships with\nD.A. Davidson\nand SDP Real Estate Investment Trust.\nThose alliances, Taylor said, open doors to construction and long-term debt that smaller suburban developers often struggle to access, saying his new partners are well-capitalized and committed to financing the project.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Amenities include a podium-top courtyard and a rooftop deck spanning about 9,800 square feet.\nA previous version called for building 20 stories with 258 residential units.\nIn 2017,\nTrammell Crow Company\nreceived an entitlement for an eight-story apartment complex and sold the project to Leap Development the following year.\nLeap began construction in 2019 but suspended work the following year, allowing the site to collect water before a 2024 public nuisance lawsuit from City Attorney\nDavid Chiu accused\nLeap of abandoning the partially excavated development site. An affiliate of Leap allegedly owed more than $1 million in fines after\ndefaulting on a $10 million loan\nsecured by the property.\nThe 0.2-acre property sold for about $1.3 million earlier this year. Thompson Builders, Leap\u2019s former contractor, had previously filed plans for 115 condominium units with no ground-floor retail; that iteration included 31 studios, 31 one-bedrooms, 36 two-bedrooms and 17 three-bedrooms.\nThompson\u2019s latest application estimates construction costs at just under $69 million.

        "content": "A Miami homeowner is accusing the city of attempting to take private property via an allegedly abusive permitting process, a scheme that may affect more than 1,000 homes in Miami, a lawsuit claims.\nCharles \u201cChad\u201d Trausch filed an amended complaint against the city on Wednesday. He first sued the city eight months ago over the city\u2019s demands that he transfer a portion of his front yard to the city for the public right-of-way. He filed the lawsuit \u200b\u200bpro se, which means he was representing himself, in April.\nTrausch and his wife Stephanie paid $710,000 for their house in the\nBuena Vista neighborhood\n, just north of the Design District, in 2021.\nWhen his wife was expecting their baby, they sought a permit for an addition so they could accommodate more family. Trausch submitted an application to the city\u2019s zoning department for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom addition to his Miami home last year, but the city notified him that it would not issue a permit for the project until Trausch conveyed a permanent deed for a portion of his front yard, according to the complaint.\n\u201cFor twenty months, the city withheld [Trausch\u2019s] permit because he refused to give up half his front yard,\u201d the lawsuit states. Once Trausch hired attorneys, \u201cthe city suddenly decided to \u2018approve\u2019 [Trausch\u2019s] waiver request\u201d without explanation.\nSince Trausch submitted his permit application in the spring of 2024, \u201cthe cost of construction materials and labor exploded,\u201d and his lawyers estimate it will\ncost\nhim more than $200,000 to complete the addition.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys, who include Ari Bargil and Suranjan Sen of the\nInstitute for Justice\n, wrote in the amended complaint that the city of Miami has been taking property by \u201csystematically extorting hundreds of Miami residents.\u201d The Institute for Justice said it has identified 66 streets with more than 1,000 homes \u201cat threat to this scheme.\u201d\nA city spokesperson said they would respond to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment but has not yet provided a comment.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys argued that the city can\u2019t expand any right-of-way without paying the property owner for the land. Miami\u2019s procedures \u201csubject people to a shakedown,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit accuses the city of violating the\nFifth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution regarding the uncompensated taking of private property and due process.\nWhen a homeowner seeks a land-use permit, for example to build an addition, the city demands an expanded right-of-way to match the parcel\u2019s base building line. Base building lines are setbacks where owners can\u2019t build, but where they still own the land. But the city has been seeking the land via deeds instead, Trausch and his attorneys allege.\nThe Institute for Justice said that Miami has been getting homeowners to deed land over for right-of-ways for years, citing a city employee\u2019s testimony in a federal case with Trausch\u2019s neighbor that there have been \u201chundreds\u201d of these demands. The city is landbanking so that it can eventually widen roads on the affected streets.\n",

        "content": "Florida Republicans moved forward four proposals to reduce\nproperty taxes\nin the state, in spite of growing fears of funding impacts to local and emergency services.\nThe House State Affairs Committee approved four proposed constitutional amendments this week,\nCBS News\nreported. Among them is HJR 201, which would eliminate non-school homestead property taxes and could cut local government revenue by $14.1 billion in the first year it is implemented, and up to $18 billion in later years, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n.\nIn addition to HJR 201, Republicans voted on party lines to pass HJR 205, which would do away with non-school property taxes for homestead properties whose owners are 65 and older; HJR 209, which would eliminate non-school property taxes for homestead properties with\ninsurance coverage\n; and HJR 211, which would remove the $500,000 limit on transferring the property tax benefit to a new homestead.\nAll four amendments require approval by 60 percent of voters to become law, although it\u2019s unclear if and which of the bills will appear on ballots next November.\nRepublican lawmakers started work on these proposals after Gov. Ron DeSantis started calling to completely abolish property taxes, skewering them as \u201crent to the government.\u201d\nAn analysis\nby listings site Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner shows an outright elimination of property taxes would immediately increase property values between 7 and 9 percent. The aggregate value of Florida\u2019s owner-occupied housing stock would spike from $200 billion to $250 billion, the report showed. But the benefits would be uneven, Berner said.\n\u201cIt would be a boon to existing property owners,\u201d he told Realtor.com. \u201cBut this measure would disproportionately benefit wealthy Floridians at the expense of those who don\u2019t own homes, and would make it even harder to break into homeownership because of the increased prices.\u201d\nOpponents of the cuts also say it could induce a fiscal crisis for local governments, and leave crucial services like EMS, fire departments and road maintenance underfunded. Local leaders, including the Florida Association of Counties, Florida League of Cities, and Florida Fire Chiefs Association, have all raised fears about the consequences of billions lost in funding.\n\u201cThis is the biggest, \u2018bro, just trust me,\u2019 that I have ever seen in my life,\u201d State Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Miami Democrat, told the State Affairs Committee, according to published reports. \u201cHow many firefighters are dispensable?

Read King leased the location back to Macy\u2019s after its purchase until March of this year, leaving the 57-year-old mall without a major draw.\nRead King\nsenior associate Travis Read told the outlet that the firm is negotiating with a grocer, a fitness center and a beauty school for the reimagined space. The grocer would anchor the project with about 65,000 square feet on the first floor, while the rest of the ground level would be carved into restaurant and retail bays along the building\u2019s east and west faces. Roughly 44,000 square feet upstairs would be leased to smaller tenants, with remaining space used for utilities.\nInstead of the full teardown the developer initially contemplated, Read King opted to adapt the hulking structure, citing its fortress-like construction, high visibility from Interstate 45 and the steep cost of ground-up replacement. Plans to reclad the exterior and install new glass storefronts will bring what Read called a \u201cretro vibe\u201d that nods to the mall\u2019s history. Bellaire-based Boucher Design Group is leading the architectural work.\nAcross Kleckley Drive, the firm plans to add a detention pond and two pad sites for sale or ground lease \u2014 likely to restaurant or retail users. Permitting is underway, with a groundbreaking expected in early 2025, though Read declined to disclose development costs.\nAlmeda Mall\nitself has been in long-term decline, having lost its Burlington anchor last year and cycling through tenants as national chains retrench. Current occupants include DD\u2019s Discounts, Foot Locker and Bath &amp; Body Works, plus a small food court. It\u2019s separately owned by South Florida-based\n4th Dimension Properties\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Will Kwan, a co-op board member who testified Tuesday against a bill requiring boards to tell rejected buyers why they were denied, said he can \u201ccount on one hand the number of applications we have rejected\u201d during his 28 years on the board.\nSo, if the bill passes, only about once every seven years would his board have to explain a rejection to a would-be buyer. Not a compelling argument against it, Mr. Kwan!\nBut I don\u2019t want to pick on a long-serving, unpaid board member. I am one myself. Fortunately, City Council member Eric Dinowitz voiced an even more illogical argument for me to highlight.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more prudent to just get more data, get better data before we invariably increase the risk for individual board members and increase the costs for shareholders?\u201d he said, according to\nSheridan Wall\u2019s article\n.\nDid you pick up on Dinowitz\u2019s hypocrisy? It\u2019s subtle at first but becomes clearer if you read his quote two or three times.\nDinowitz demands data while saying something wholly unsupported by data. To quote Dinowitz, before making claims, wouldn\u2019t it be prudent for him to just get more and better data showing the bill would \u201cinvariably\u201d increase the risk and costs for shareholders?\nAll he has to do is look at what happened in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties after they passed similar legislation. Spoiler alert: Nothing. There was no increase in lawsuits filed by rejected buyers.\n\u201cThere is nothing about writing a letter that increases your costs,\u201d Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, told me. \u201cAnd the idea that there\u2019s an army of lawyers out there waiting to feast off non-compliant disclosures is patently absurd.\u201d\nAs readers of\nThe Real Deal\nknow, I often criticize Council bills that would create compliance headaches but little or no benefit. And I have not hesitated to call out Council member\nPierina Sanchez\nor Public Advocate\nJumaane Williams\nwhen I think they\u2019re wrong.\nBut, like most real estate agents, I believe they\u2019re right that people applying to buy into a co-op deserve a timely answer from the board and to know why they are rejected. Fears of litigation have not been borne out where such laws were implemented.\nIt\u2019s quite possible that bidders who are kept in limbo or rejected without explanation are\nmore\nlikely to sue. Give them answers and they tend to move on with their house hunting.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nChristine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit WIN (formerly Women In Need) came up with a Chutes and Ladders-style\nboard game\nto cleverly demonstrate the pitfalls families face while navigating the city\u2019s\nlong, complicated process\nto get affordable housing. Should the Real Estate Board of New York come up with a landlord\u2019s version for any particular program? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: With Steve Buscemi\u2019s sale of his Park Slope townhouse, there might be no movie stars left in Park Slope other than John Turturro. The neighborhood previously lost Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, and probably some others that I\u2019m forgetting. Kelly McGillis (Tom Cruise\u2019s love interest in the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d) is long gone from the brownstone on Garfield Place she had in the 1980s.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIn a recent \u201cwhat we\u2019re thinking about\u201d item, I asked if real estate firms are susceptible to the same kind of corruption that led to the conviction of 70 NYCHA employees for taking kickbacks from contractors they hired.\nOne industry veteran replied: \u201cThere is NO question that landlords, property managers, and \u2014 I would toss in \u2014 contractors and architectural firms are vulnerable to their employees\u2019 dishonesty.\u201d\nIt seems to me that whenever one person is spending another person\u2019s money, kickbacks will be a temptation.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$7.8 million\nfor a 7,414-square-foot condominium unit at 87 Leonard Street in Tribeca. Emily Beare, Lexi Alper and Beth Doud Tomashoff with CORE had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.5 million\nfor a former Family Dollar store at 224-11 Linden Boulevard in Cambria Heights.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.75 million\nfor a co-op unit at The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side. Daniela Kunen with Douglas Elliman has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 15,230-square-foot, 18-unit project at 715 East 224th Street in Wakefield. Mohammad Badaly filed the permit.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Sometimes all it takes is one big fish.\nThe hush-hush ultra-luxury offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development at 80 Clarkson Street is the first Manhattan condo project to crack a projected sellout of over $2 billion since the\ninfamous Xi from HFZ Capital in 2018\n.\nThe two-tower project along the West Side Highway helped push the total sellout for the 10 most expensive condo projects in Manhattan above the $3 billion mark for the first time in the last three years.\nThat $3 billion serves as a new benchmark shows how far removed the city is from the boomtown years when multiple projects each year would cross the billion-dollar sellout threshold.\nAfter 80 Clarkson, which represents a staggering 63 percent of the total sellout volume of the top 10 condos filed this year, there is not a single project with a projected volume of over $400 million.\nPart of the low-key totals may be due to buildings holding back on pricing all of their units. MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residence at 126 East 57th Street, for example, only has pricing on 38 of its 145 residential units, which explains why the project, which sits on the eastern end of Billionaires\u2019 Row, has a sellout of just over $100 million.\nAt the same time, top projects in recent years have continued to shrink. Of the top 10 condo filings, half have fewer than 50 units.\nThe years of dwindling sellouts may be catching up with the city, as multiple development marketing firms are projecting\nrecord-low inventory levels\nheading into 2026.\nDetails on the 10 most expensive projects that are underway and filed this year can be found below, which\nThe Real Deal\nanalyzed using plans filed with the attorney general and data from New York City.\n80 Clarkson Street | $2.2B\nAfter years of slicing and dicing its valuable land holdings along the West Side Highway, Atlas Capital Group partnered up with Zeckendorf Development to launch 80 Clarkson, the\nmost expensive project the city has seen in years\n.\nWith Baupost as equity partner, Atlas and the Zeckendorfs bought out another developer from the site with a\n$322 million loan from Blackstone\nin 2022 before going on to secure the largest residential construction loan in the city since the pandemic, a\n$985 million construction loan\nfrom Cale Street Partners and Farallon Capital Management.\nAll of that financing has helped build out some of the most expensive units in Downtown Manhattan, including an\n$80 million penthouse\nthat spans over 7,000 square feet.\nBut time will tell if all the investment has paid off, as the building hasn\u2019t reported a single contract since launching sales earlier this year. Cookfox is designing the building, and an in-house team led by Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson is overseeing sales.\n400 East 84th Street | $328M\nRelated Companies has bucked the trend of converting buildings into rentals by instead turning rentals into condos at The Strathmore on 400 East 84th Street on the Upper East Side.\nAfter securing a $100 million refinancing from Tyko Capital on the 48-story building earlier this year, Related set about converting the long-time rental building to capitalize on the growing demand in the Upper East Side.\nPricing is running relatively affordable for the area, with one bedrooms starting at $1.1 million and the most expensive four-bedroom units topping out around $5.5 million.\nThe 144-unit development is being designed by Tony Ingrao and Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group launched sales in October.\n142 West 21st Street | $170M\nYiannes Einhorn\u2019s Grid Group is turning a former two-story parking garage in Chelsea into a high-end condo building at 142 West 21st Street. It\nbought the site for $31 million in 2021\n.\nDesigned by BKSK Architects, the development, called The Myles, features 16 parking spaces for its 22 units. The priciest condo is the 13th-floor five-bedroom penthouse with a private rooftop spa pool, going for $17 million.\nNicole Hechter and Masayo Hashimoto of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group are leading sales and marketing for the project.\n201 East 23rd Street | $164M\nAfter claiming the top two spots in last year\u2019s top condo filing list, Naftali Group came in fourth this year with its project The Willow at 201 East 23rd Street in Kips Bay.\nIn 2023, Naftali\npaid $21.5 million to lease the site\nfor 99 years from Snake River Development, an entity of BNS Real Estate. Designed by Cookfox, the 19-story brick facade will have 69 units, a private courtyard, rooftop terrace, fitness center and screening room.\nAlexa Lambert and Compass New Development Marketing launched sales in April and closings are expected to begin next year. The building is more than halfway sold, according to Marketproof.\n133 East 55th Street | $132M\nA joint venture from Rybak Development and BK Developers is developing a 20-story condo building on the corners of Lexington Avenue and 55th Street.\nThe team purchased the site for $24 million in 2021 and secured a $52 million construction loan from Emerald Creek Capital last year. The project will house 31 condos and include amenities like a spa complex, fitness center, and outdoor rec area.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $10 million for a three-bedroom penthouse.\nZproekt Architecture is designing the building and sales do not appear to have launched yet.\n350 East 18th Street | $116M\nA joint venture from Israeli-based Minrav Development and NYC-based T&amp;E 1 Development is developing a 54-unit condo project in Gramercy.\nThe developers picked up the site for $28.5 million in 2020 and secured a $63 million construction from Northwind Group in 2024.\nDesigned by ARC Architecture + Design Studio, the building will include 18 parking spaces, a full-time doorman, gym and rooftop terrace. Prices start at under $2 million for a one-bedroom and up to $6 million for a three-bedroom penthouse, which is one of the 14 units in contract at the building, according to Marketproof.\nJohn Gomes and Fredrik Eklund of the Eklund Gomes Team and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n24-28 West 9th Street | $115M\nOphir Sternberg\u2019s Lionheart Capital is turning a pre-war apartment building into 45 luxury condos on a coveted stretch of Greenwich Village.\nSternberg bought the property for $41.5 million in 2022 and Stonehill Taylor designed the conversion of the 1923 building.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $5 million for a three-bedroom penthouse with 1,270 square feet of outdoor space. Shlomi Reuveni\u2019s Reuveni Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n126 East 57th Street | $111M\nA development triumvirate led by Rotem Rosen is developing the newest Billionaires\u2019 Row entrant, the Malabar Residences.\nIn 2019, Rosen, Israeli developer Zahi Hagag and Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra\u2019s\ndropped almost $104 million cash\non a 13-parcel assemblage. The developers then secured a\n$170 million construction loan\nfrom Bank OZK in 2022 for their roughly 350-foot-tall project.\nThe developers have only released pricing for roughly a quarter of the 145 units in the building, and prices range from under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $12 million for a three-bedroom penthouse. Designed by ODA Architecture, the building includes a fitness center, swimming pool, spa pool, steam room, sauna and indoor half-basketball court.\nThe project has moved in fits and starts. Rosen\u2019s development firm MRR had to\nplead with a court\nnot once, but twice, to grant access to a neighboring property in order to continue work on the project.\nEarlier this year, the project lost its sales director when\nNoble Black\ndecamped to Corcoran\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Maria Mainieri took over as sales director, according to her website, and is marketing the building along with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\n118 West 13th Street | $92M\nSlate Property Group has claim to the smallest development on the list with their project at 118 West 13th Street dubbed The Katherine.\nIn 2021, Slate\nbought the site for $22.9 million\nwith private equity partner Avenue Realty Capital and gutted the seven-story building. Incredibly, the 34,000-square-foot property once housed 175 students as a dorm for The New School. BKSK Architects and designer Nate Berkus converted the building into just eight residences starting at just under $10 million.\nSeven of the units have already sold since Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg launched sales in the spring with Compass Development Marketing. The remaining available condo is the top-floor penthouse, asking over $22 million.\n114 East 25th Street | $74M\nAdellco has already sold through its 20 units at the Armorie after announcing its planned sales launch in February. The trick? Sell them all to one buyer.\nThe developer bought the commercial building from crowdfunding firm Prodigy Network and Shorewood Real Estate Group for $41.3 million five years ago in order to convert it into condos.\nAfter Corcoran Group\u2019s Hottinger Team started quietly marketing the residential units in the spring, a buyer came forward with an offer to buy them and the building\u2019s commercial space for $71 million. The buyer was a private family office, Adellco founder and CEO Matthew Adell previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nConstruction is expected to be complete in the first quarter of next year and amenities will include a gym, roof deck and lounge. Andre Kikoski Architecture is designing the building.",

        "content": "The vultures are circling\ntroubled multifamily investor Jon Venetos\n.\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was hit with two new lawsuits from Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, filings with Dallas County District Court show.\nKeybank is asking the court to appoint an emergency receiver for the properties tied to the loans: Villa Del Tesoro, at 7802 Villa Cliff Drive, and 46 Eleven, at 4611 Samuell Boulevard. Both are in Dallas.\nThe bank alleges Venetos defaulted on the $16.85 million loan tied to the 229-unit Villas Del Tesoro and the $7.15 million loan tied to 79-unit 46 Eleven. Keybank originated the loans on a refinance of the properties in October 2024. It claims Venetos personally guaranteed the loans.\nVenetos stopped paying monthly interest payments on the loans in June, and failed to pay them off when they matured in October, Keybank claims. In addition, he stopped paying property taxes and insurance for the properties and allowed liens to be placed against them, Keybank said in the filing.\nThe lender further alleges that Venetos transferred a total of $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account. Inspections conducted in October 2025 revealed multiple units out of commission in each property, deferred repairs and mold, the bank said.\nLeaving the properties in Venetos\u2019 control \u201cthreatens to accelerate the deterioration\u201d of the assets.\nThe Keybank filings are the latest in a passel of default lawsuits from Venetos\u2019 lenders.\nHe started losing properties in April, when Acore claimed he defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas and started\nauctioning off the Florida properties\n. Acore also claims he personally guarantied the loans and is asking for an\n$81 million judgment\nagainst him.\nIn the last three months, Venetos has been hit with a succession of lawsuits, starting with one\nfrom Select Securities Europe\n, which accused him of defaulting on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million. There was a\nlawsuit from Fannie Mae\n, accusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex.\nVista Bank also sued him\n, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex. Vista alleges Venetos still owes $3 million.\nThere\u2019s a fraud element to Vista\u2019s accusation. In the suit, it accused him of \u201cattempting to obtain credit at another financial institution using false, altered, or fraudulent account statements of Vista.\u201d\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

The price breaks down to $254,854 per apartment.\nThe buyer assumed the seller\u2019s existing $38.6 million loan from MetLife Real Estate Lending and refinanced it as a Fannie Mae loan, bumping up the total $45 million.\nCompleted in 2018 on nearly 10 acres, the complex consists of two five-story buildings and two four-story buildings, Vizzda records show. Palm Beach Gardens-based\nEastwind Development\nbuilt Ventura Pointe.\nLloyd Jones, led by Christopher Finlay, paid\n$55.6 million\nfor Ventura Pointe in 2019, records show.\nThe firm, a multifamily and senior housing investor, has developed, owned and managed about $1.2 billion in multifamily properties since 1990, according to its website.\nFort Lauderdale-based Ortsac, a private family office also led by the Castro couple\u2019s children and grandchildren, has a portfolio of more than $700 million of multifamily assets under management and investments in commercial real estate, its website says. Bobby, who describes himself as a self-made entrepreneur, and Sofia Castro founded and owned\nBankers Healthcare Group\n, which they sold. They also founded and lead Stack and Rack, a three-day multifamily investment bootcamp, according to the Castros\u2019 LinkedIns and Bobby\u2019s website.\nIn 2021, Ortsac sold the 368-unit Lakeview Flats apartment complex at 8800 Northwest 78th Court and 8900 Northwest 77th Court in Tamarac for\n$69 million\n. That same year, it sold the 368-unit Golfview Flats apartment complex at 8445 Springtree Drive in Sunrise for\n$15 million\n.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market boomed in the years after the pandemic\u2019s onset due to an influx of out-of-staters, creating unprecedented demand and\nrecord rent growth\n.\nBut after developers seized on the bonanza with a flurry of new projects, the region experienced a record\n18,600 completions\nlast year just as the pipeline of new residents slowed. This led to slower lease-ups and a drop in rents, with Realtor.com showing the median asking rent in the tri-county region decreased 3 percent in October, year-over-year.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive increases in 2022 and 2023. As a result, some landlords are struggling to refinance maturing loans or meet debt obligations on floating-rate debt. Some lenders retrenched from issuing new loans while they worked out extensions and forbearance agreements with existing borrowers.\nDiscounted multifamily deals have popped up in South Florida.\nIn September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit Solena West Miami complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for\n$111 million\n, marking a 4.7 percent discount from its previous $116.4 million price. Waterton had bought the two-building complex in two deals in 2016 and 2017.\nLast year, Rreef Property Trust sold the 368-unit Marela complex at 250 Northwest 130th Avenue in Pembroke Pines for\n$110 million\n, or 9 percent less than the firm had paid in 2021.\n",

        "content": "Renowned architect Robert A.M. Sterns,\nwho died last week\nat the age of 86, will be primarily remembered for the condos he designed in New York City and\nSouth Florida\n.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Sterns Architects (RAMSA) also garnered recognition for what\u2019s shaping up to be a genre-defining project in Texas. In addition to New York entries such as the Naftali Group\u2019s\nBellemont\nand\n15 Central Park West\nfor Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, the list of notable Stern-designed projects will soon include Howard Hughes Holdings\u2019 Ritz-Carlton Residences in The Woodlands.\nThe Real Deal tapped the project as an \u201c\nit building\n\u201d earlier this year. As Ritz-Carlton\u2019s first stand-alone condo project in Texas, it adds a new level of luxury to the state\u2019s burgeoning condo market.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\n\u201cHe was very much involved from day one,\u201d he said.\nCities like New York and Miami are swimming in high-end condo projects, but in Texas, luxury residential real estate has long revolved around the ranch. The Ritz-Carlton Residences is a big swing that will test demand for high-end vertical living.\nSo far, it\u2019s looking like a big swing worth taking. Before the foundation was laid, 69 percent of the 111 units were pre-sold, prompting Howard Hughes to pause presales and open up a waitlist.\nCruz contends that the project has opened the floodgates of branded condos in Houston by giving others \u201cthe courage to follow suit.\u201d Since the Ritz started taking shape, Sunny Bathija\u2019s Satya unveiled plans for a standalone St. Regis condo tower in Houston\u2019s Rice/Military. Deiso Moss announced it\u2019s building a Ritz-Carlton condo tower and hotel in Houston\u2019s Uptown/Galleria neighborhood.\nThe project sits on 8 acres on Lake Woodlands and includes a 15-story building and an 11-story. The design highlights the scenic lakefront with views across the lake.\nStern was inspired by Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood, Cruz said, so the project was designed to incorporate the tradition of John Staub, the early-20th century residential architect who designed single-family homes throughout the prestigious enclave.\nCruz describes Staub\u2019s style as having \u201ca restrained sense of detail\u201d and \u201ctimeless design\u201d\nCruz touched on what makes the project unique at an\nOctober event\nthat was part of BSH and The Real Deal\u2019s Building Luxury series.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences was also designed with the end-user in mind. Many Houston condo buyers are empty-nesters who are downsizing from single-family homes. To ease the transition to vertical living, the design offers a uniquely wide variety of apartment layouts to provide buyers with the sense of individuality baked into the single-family home. Of the 111 units, 55 are unique.\n\u201cAll beautiful American neighborhoods have variety in terms of the houses,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cSo that same attitude, but combined in a condominium.\u201d\nThe Ritz project will be RAMSA\u2019s ninth in Texas.\nThe firm designed the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas, a 70-unit condo tower that includes hotel amenities. The brick and limestone building is designed in a simplified Regency style.\nThe firm\u2019s other Texas projects are mostly public landmarks. RAMSA designed the upgrade for the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas as well as the George W. Bush Presidential Center, also at Southern Methodist University.\n",

        "content": "Rockwood Capital\u2019s Christmas wish came true: it sold its Midtown office tower near Grand Central Terminal. But it may feel like a stocking of coal compared to previous offloading efforts.\nSovereign Partners sealed the deal on a $273 million acquisition of 2 Grand Central Tower on Thursday, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal for the 667,000-square-foot property breaks down to $409 per square foot.\nThis year, Rockwood put the property on the market, seeking a sale price of roughly $270 million. The last time the private equity investor tried to sell, back in February 2020 (shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic hit), Rockwood had expected to sell the tower for\nclose to $580 million\n, more than double its more recent aspiration.\nRockwood purchased the office building in 2011 from Boston Properties, now BXP, for $401 million. Boston Properties bought it for almost $428 million in 2008 from Harry Macklowe, who developed it.\nThe Promote\nreported\nthat Sovereign Partners was finalizing a deal for the office building towards the end of October, but it didn\u2019t close until this week.\nEastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the transaction. Buyer and seller did not return requests for comment from the Observer.\nRockwood\nsecured\na $262.6 million refinancing of the 44-story tower in July, replacing the previous $260 million loan on the property made in 2018; both loans came courtesy of MetLife, which is providing $177 million in acquisition financing to Sovereign.\nTenants include the Nuvo Group, Maersk, Cigna and various financial, legal and professional services firms. Rockwood also has its headquarters in the building.\nRockwood recently announced that it would integrate its operations into Harrison Street Asset Management; the two companies are subsidiaries of Colliers International. Two months ago, it listed the 230,000-square-foot office building at 1 Broadway in the Financial District, seeking\n$180 million\n.\nCyrus and Darius Sakhai\u2019s Sovereign Partners are investors in the Midtown East market. Last year, it bought 780 Third Avenue from Nuveen for $178 million. Earlier, Sovereign Partners landed 100-104 FIfth Avenue from Clarion Partners for the\nheavily discounted price\nof $125 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "What keeps New York\u2019s top commercial real estate players awake at night? Politics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s political risk at all levels,\u201d Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau said during a panel discussion on Wednesday. \u201cNational, state and city.\u201d\nBlau joined a group of CRE heavyweights \u2014 Bill Rudin of Rudin Management, Winston Fisher of Fisher Brothers and Mary Ann Tighe of CBRE \u2014 on stage at the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate capital markets conference to discuss, among other things, the looming uncertainty posed by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\nPanelists weighed the broader social proposals Mamdani has championed. Free childcare and subsidized transportation, Fisher argued, aren\u2019t just social gestures, they\u2019re economic levers that could keep more families in the city. The cost of early childhood care is a massive tax on the working and middle class, he said. He also proposed offering free bus service to select groups, like CUNY students, noting that transportation costs prevent many from completing their degrees.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real estate angle that he\u2019s talking about, but it is infinitely deeper than that,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe are tethered to New York. We have to help him solve these problems because they are growing every day.\u201d\nBut Tighe cautioned against comingling housing legislation with social mandates.\n\u201cOne of the challenges for this mayor is there\u2019s a lot of virtue signaling going on \u2014 free this, free that,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cBut the reality of it is, you have to understand if you want to build housing, focus on building housing. Because if there\u2019s anything that history has shown us, you make a clear, crisp piece of legislation that has a target, and these folks will make it a reality.\u201d\nBlau said he is hopeful that Mamdani will continue the current mayor\u2019s initiatives that encourage companies to come to New York.\n\u201cThe reason companies come here is because talent wants to be here,\u201d Blau said. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s job to make New York City the place where people want to continue to come.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s housing shortage dominated much of the discussion. Rudin zeroed in on the vacant rent-stabilized units kept off the market due to restrictions on rent increases.\n\u201cRaise that cap, you would see within six months these units come back on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the mayor-elect, we\u2019ve told him and his people.\u201d\nAll the panelists emphasized the need for the city government to work with private developers to draft legislation that makes sense. Not surprisingly, they were critical of the city\u2019s 485x tax break, which includes a wage floor that kicks in for projects with 100 or more units, making it difficult for large projects to pencil out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a plethora of opportunities to continue to create more housing,\u201d Fisher said, adding that there needs to be incentive for the private sector. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub. I think if he allows private capital to come in and have an adequate return, private capital will build.\u201d\nDespite the clear uncertainty, the panel struck a cautiously optimistic tone. Fisher and Tighe highlighted New York\u2019s resilience, cultural vibrancy and tolerance for difference as reasons to believe the city can thrive, whatever way the political winds blow. While his ideology is unmistakable, panelists noted signs that Mamdani might navigate city politics with a mix of conviction and compromise.\n\u201cHe sort of plays the \u2018I didn\u2019t realize how complex it was gonna be\u2019 card very often, and with that, he says, \u2018I\u2019ll be more pragmatic now,\u2019\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. We\u2019ll find out shortly, but he is learning very quickly that there\u2019s a ton of powerful constituencies that have a real voice, and when they speak, you have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One year later, sweeping changes to New York City\u2019s zoning rules are shaping the trajectory of housing projects.\nDevelopers are moving forward with plans for larger residential buildings. Air rights deals are\nheating up\n. Homeowners are moving forward with adding so-called granny flats.\nFriday is the\none-year anniversary\nof the City Council\u2019s\npassage\nof the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a text amendment that eliminated parking mandates from some parts of the city, legalized accessory dwelling units, created new high-density residential districts, expanded what office buildings can be converted to residential and\nmuch more\n.\nIn recognition of the one-year mark, the Department of City Planning on Friday released a few stats on the progress of the text amendment.\nCity of Yes created the Universal Affordability Preference program, which\nreplaced\nthe city\u2019s Voluntary Inclusionary Housing program. The program provides a 20 percent density bonus to projects if the extra space is dedicated to permanently affordable housing, which must, on average, be affordable to those earning 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe city released applications for UAP in April, and has since received applications for more than 100 housing developments, according to City Planning. The agency would not provide details on these properties, but indicated that the projects are expected to net 5,400 new homes, of which 900 would be affordable.\nCity of Yes also\nmade it easier\nto transfer air rights from landmarked buildings and freed some of these transactions from the city\u2019s land-use review process (transfers that would increase the height of a project by more than 25 percent still need a special permit, though).\nThe changes have spurred more of these deals than in previous years. Five buildings have since sought approval for such air rights transfers, which would result in 400,000 square feet of new development, according to City Planning. By comparison, the city received only 15 applications for this kind of transfer over the last 50 years.\nSince launching applications for accessory dwelling units in September, 98 homeowners in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island have applied.\nCity of Yes also created two new residential zoning districts, known as R11 and R12. In such districts (which must be applied through a rezoning), buildings can be 15 or 18 times the size of the lot where they are constructed, referred to as having a floor area ratio of 15 or 18.\nThese districts have only been mapped once so far, as part of the\nMidtown South\nrezoning. The districts have been proposed at two individual sites:\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\nin Downtown Brooklyn and\na site above\nthe Second Avenue subway extension.\nOfficials projected that City of Yes would add 80,000 housing units over the next 15 years. Whether that comes to fruition will depend on myriad factors, including to what extent future administrations and City Council members support development.\nSome in the industry think the current Council might stifle construction if it passes\nfour bills\nthat would set new rules for affordable housing production in the city. Developers have also argued that construction wage rules attached to the property tax break 485x will lead to less housing, and stunt the impact of City of Yes, as well as the housing ballot measures that voters approved in November.\n",

        "content": "Inter Miami\u2019s\nSergio Busquets is looking to sell his waterfront home near Fort Lauderdale for $9.8 million, just two years after buying the property.\nBusquets, considered one of the best defensive midfielders in soccer, is retiring from Major League Soccer at the end of this year.\nHe and his wife, Elena Galera,\npaid about $8.7 million\nfor the seven-bedroom, six-and-a-half bathroom house at 7 Seneca Road in the gated\nSea Ranch Lakes\ncommunity in 2023. That sale marked a record for Sea Ranch Lakes, a small town about 5 miles away from Inter Miami\u2019s Fort Lauderdale stadium.\nThe 7,100-square-foot home, built in 2023, sits on a 0.3-acre lot with about 100 feet of frontage on Lake Seneca. The home includes a three-car garage. Veroushka Volkert of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing. She also brokered the previous sale.\nESPN reported in October that Busquets plans to take a break from soccer before he pursues coaching.\n\u201cI think in the future, yes [I\u2019d want to be a coach], but for now I\u2019d rather take a sabbatical,\u201d\nBusquets told reporters\n. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time, with hardly any weekends. \u2026 You want to enjoy time with your family, time for me, for them, seeing my children, being with them, traveling more, watching football from a different perspective.\u201d\nBusquets played for FC Barcelona from 2008 until he and Lionel Messi joined Inter Miami, the MLS team owned by brothers\nJorge and Jose Mas\n,\nDavid Beckham\nand other investors.\nMessi lives nearby. Also in 2023, he and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo,\npaid $10.8 million\nfor a 10,500-square-foot, eight-bedroom estate in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Bay Colony neighborhood. He also owns luxury condos\nin Sunny Isles Beach\n, including a unit at Porsche Design Tower, which was completed by Gil Dezer\u2019s Dezer Development in late 2016.Inter Miami, which includes\nAres Management\n, is moving quickly to complete a $1 billion mixed-use stadium development near Miami International Airport. Earlier this year, the partnership secured a $450 million loan from JPMorgan Chase for the project.\n",

        "content": "As the Chicago area multifamily scene keeps heating up, midmarket dealmakers are finding a sweet spot in the city.\nA trio of recent sales on the North and West sides of the city indicates that both local and out-of-state buyers are taking interest in Chicago\u2019s inventory of midsized apartment buildings.\nAt 501 West Deming Place in Lincoln Park, the estate of John A. Brown sold the deceased investor\u2019s 56-unit building for $19.4 million last month. The buyers were a joint venture led by Chicago-based Hayes Properties.\nBrown was a longtime owner of the property and last refinanced it for $11.5 million in 2016. The recent $19.4 million sale price came out to about $346,000 per unit, though two groundfloor retail spaces somewhat skew the price per unit.\n\u201cThis generational location garnered a lot of buyer interest from both institutional firms and families which allowed us to achieve an above-ask purchase price with a solid buyer,\u201d Interra Realty Broker Colin O\u2019Malley said.\nBrown earlier this year also sold a long-vacant Gold Coast building. The property, which Brown had planned to convert to condos at one point, sold to Chicago-based developer\nAltitude Capital for $10 million\n.\nWhile highrises have to compete for sparse institutional capital, midmarket properties are garnering interest from buyers who can tap into alternative sources of funding.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding not only through our capital markets group, but also our clients, that in the midmarket space, financing is not a problem \u2026 from the small regional or local lenders all the way up to the national lenders,\u201d said Essex Realty broker Jim Darrow. \u201cThey want to lend in Chicago and they want to lend on good, well-located assets.\u201d\nDarrow recently arranged a $15.7 million sale on behalf of Chicago developers Frank Campise and Jim Jann of\nJAB Real Estate\n, which completed a development play with the deal.\nJAB bought a development site at 1553 North Wells Street in Old Town in 2017 and built a 23-unit apartment building with one ground-floor retail space. The retail component is currently occupied by national coffee chain Philz Coffee.\nGround-up development is rare in Old Town, where much of the area is already built out and older buildings still carry high replacement costs, Darrow said.\n\u201cThese older, vintage-type buildings, they\u2019re worth a lot of money,\u201d Darrow said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to tear them down and build new construction.\u201d\nThe JAB property got interest from local and out of state buyers and ultimately sold to San Francisco-based Epp Properties. The sale came out to roughly $682,000 per unit.\nFurther northwest in the city, developer\nNoah Properties\nsold Block Belmont, a midsize building in Belmont Cragin, to local investor Terezia Covaci for $18.5 million.\nNoah, which is led by husband-and-wife duo Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek, bought the development site in 2020 for $750,000 with a $525,000 loan from Belmont Bank and Trust.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how much the developers put into the construction of the apartment building, but they initially took out a $9.7 million construction loan from Parkview Financial and later refinanced the property with a $13 million loan from GreenState Credit Union in 2023.\n",

        "content": "When Vickey Barron\u2019s client, a 27-year-old working in finance, heard what his bonus was going to be last year, he went on a \u201cshopping spree.\u201d\n\u201cI would imagine it feels like, \u2018Oh, I just won the lottery,\u2019\u201d said Barron, a veteran Compass agent. \u201c[They were] fixated on buying. It wasn\u2019t a question, it was: \u2018let\u2019s find the right property.\u2019\u201d\nThey ended up with a Chelsea condo for just under $5 million.\nBarron\u2019s client is one of many finance workers in the city with a winning lottery ticket in the form of a big year-end bonus. The city\u2019s biggest firms have turned in some of their best trading years in history, and New York City brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nthat cash flow has inspired a slew of buyers.\nBusiness hawks strategized and spent to prevent Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor, but the city\u2019s\nluxury market hasn\u2019t skipped a beat following his election\nand the doomsday predictions that came with it.\nBut the timing makes sense: Wall Street bonuses are expected to bounce back this year after a lull, with one\nforecast projecting a rise to their highest level in four years\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with a lot of finance people right now that are, I think, feeling very bullish,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen.\nBonuses in the securities industry rose 34 percent to a record $47.5 billion in 2024, according to a\nreport\nfrom the state comptroller\u2019s office. Trading firms like Jane Street Capital in particular rode booming equities markets to\nrecord trading profits\nlast year, with many companies on pace to do the same in 2025.\nEmployees at these firms, who often pay interns six-figure salaries, can earn millions in bonuses alone. In 2024, Jane Street gave out over\n$2.4 billion in bonuses\n, an average of $900,000 per employee.\nBarron said she has two more clients who work for Jane Street looking for Downtown Manhattan homes in the $5 million range after renting what \u201cyou would rent right out of college\u201d for the last year.\n\u201cThey could have afforded far more than what they were renting, but I think they honestly were just working so hard that they just needed a bed to sleep in,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now, of course, they\u2019re out shopping to buy because it paid off.\u201d\nWhile the first-time buyers splurging on their first apartments have been pumping the $5 million-plus market, industry veterans have been trading some of the city\u2019s trophy properties as well this year.\nEarlier this year, a financier was behind a Downtown Manhattan record. Harsh Padia, CEO of trading firm HAP Capital, sold his\nduplex at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles Street for $60 million\n. The buyer was\nreportedly\nfrom Jane Street Capital, which has its office just minutes away down the West Side Highway.\nCompass\u2019 Zeve Salman, who represented the buyer on that deal, said he\u2019s working with at least a dozen other buyers looking for homes over $30 million and only sees prices going up.\n\u201cI would almost guarantee you\u2019ll see more records broken before the end of the year, and that is all post-election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers that we\u2019re discussing with people, the type of properties that we were discussing \u2014 it\u2019s the exact same caliber, and it\u2019s still all local people.\u201d\nLuxury sales in the city have been particularly strong in recent months, after a spring market bogged down by economic and geopolitical uncertainty. In November, contracts signed in Manhattan for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent year-over-year, according to a report from Miller Samuel. And in Brooklyn, the borough has seen contract volume crack $100 million in each of the last two months, a rarity for the borough.\n\u201cThere were not enough buyers actively looking last spring, and it\u2019s been night and day to this fall,\u201d said Compass Kallie Catt, who has put four homes into contract in the last several weeks, including a Dumbo condo asking $5.5 million.\nBuyers who have profited from the stock market in the last few years may have another motivation to buy real estate in the city \u2014 getting out of the market.\nCorcoran\u2019s Ryan Kaplan said many of his clients in finance \u201cfeel that the market is objectively frothy.\u201d\n\u201cThings are very rosy for these kinds of people, financially speaking,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably why we\u2019re starting to see them deploying capital.\u201d\nDespite the money flowing into the market, Kaplan said buyers \u2014 especially the fiscally savvy ones \u2014 are still wary about getting a good deal. \u201cThere is this sense of opportunism,\u201d he said, where buyers know that inflation is still high, debt is still expensive and the presidential and mayoral elections have ruffled some feathers.\nThat maneuvering has meant\nsellers getting realistic with pricing\nhas been just as important for the market this fall, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Michelle Griffith. \u201cIf buyers wanted to come into the market earlier this year, the sellers weren\u2019t as flexible,\u201d she said.\nBut desperate buyers trying to fearmonger their way into a discount after the election may still be out of luck, according to Salman.\n[\u201cAgents will] come to a $10 million listing and it\u2019ll be like, \u2018Well, you know, the election \u2014 so he really thinks it\u2019s worth $9 million,\u2019\u201d Salman said.\nBut, for now at least, \u201cthose same properties end up selling close to their asking price,\u201d he added.\n",

        "content": "Beyond Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s interests in connecting with princes, former presidents and financial heavyweights, the\nlate, disgraced\nfinancier sometimes extended his attention to commercial real estate.\nAmong the more than 20,000 documents obtained by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from Epstein\u2019s estate and released to the public in November were emails with links to\nThe Real Deal\narticles and what appears to be a saved or printed\nTRD\nweb story from June 2019. The emails and\nTRD\narticles touched on a Palm Beach development deal, a members-only club and a dealmaker who faced tax issues.\nThe documents shed some light on Epstein\u2019s Rolodex of business contacts at a time when the source of his wealth still remains somewhat of a mystery. At the time of his death in August 2019, Epstein\u2019s net worth was close to $600 million, which was largely thanks to two clients, Les Wexner and Leon Black. Epstein was the money manager to billionaire L Brands founder Wexner and he provided tax and estate planning services to Black, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management.\nBut Epstein appears to have had a keen interest in real estate more generally.\nA review of the documents shows he was also at least nominally interested in one Palm Beach development deal. In another email, he claims to have put the founders of a popular members-only club with a location in New York City \u201cin business.\u201d One email refers to a\nTRD\narticle about a case brought against a New York developer for tax evasion. Others provide insight into Epstein\u2019s partnership with New York real estate heavyweight Andrew Farkas on a small marina in the British Virgin Islands.\nOpaque real estate connections\nEpstein had owned ultra-luxury homes, but most reporting has not suggested that he was looking at commercial projects. His own property included a mansion in Palm Beach, a townhouse in Manhattan, an estate in New Mexico and, most notably, two private islands in the Virgin Islands where his victims were allegedly sexually abused.\nThough his brother, Mark Epstein, ran a New York real estate firm called Ossa Properties, Mark consistently maintained Jeffrey was not involved. After Ossa acquired a number of condo units in a building at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, Mark told Crain\u2019s in 2019 that his brother was renting apartments there, and that he had acquired the building in the early \u201990s based on a tip from Jeffrey. He added that his brother was not his business partner and his brother\u2019s investment firm, J. Epstein &amp; Co., had no connection to Ossa Properties, despite public filings showing otherwise.\nBut Jonathan Barrett, who worked at Ossa Properties, told the Wall Street Journal in 2019 through a spokesperson that Ossa and J. Epstein &amp; Co. were indeed affiliated.\nJonathan Barrett\u2019s brother Anthony appears to be the point person in recent years at Ossa Properties and has signed for an affiliate of the company in public documents recorded with the city. (Ossa Properties did not return a request to comment.)\nNew details\nEmails released by Congress show that Anthony Barrett at least considered Jeffrey Epstein a possible buyer of commercial real estate in Palm Beach.\nAmong the large batch of documents is an email from Barrett to Epstein in October 2018. In the email, with the subject line \u201cDeal info,\u201d Barrett sent Epstein the text of a recent\nTRD\narticle about the Palm House hotel in Palm Beach, which was heading to a bankruptcy sale.\nAnthony Barrett: Hi jeffrey,\nCam across this\u2026perhaps you have some interest?\nEpstein responded: \u201cfunn, but quite a mess.\u201d\nFederal prosecutors had accused the previous developer of the Palm House Hotel of siphoning millions of dollars in foreign investors\u2019 money. The investors, who put in more than $44 million as part of the federal EB-5 program, filed their own lawsuit, alleging the development group falsely touted that the hotel\u2019s advisory board would include Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and Celine Dion, Bill Koch and Tony Bennett were already members at the hotel\u2019s club.\nEpstein, who had a house about a mile away in Palm Beach, apparently had some interest in the story.\nAmong the other documents provided by the Epstein estate and released by Congress was a digital version of a more\nin-depth article\nabout the saga of the Palm House hotel that\nTRD\npublished in June 2019. The document shows the story was saved a week after\nTRD\npublished the story.\nJust one month later, in July 2019, Epstein was arrested in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking. Prosecutors alleged Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls. In August, Epstein died by suicide while awaiting charges in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.\nThere were other emails discussing news articles about various real estate happenings. In an April 2018 email, Richard Kahn, Epstein\u2019s accountant, sent Epstein a\nTRD\narticle about Michael Shvo\u2019s recent settlement of his tax evasion case with the Manhattan District Attorney.\nKahn: \u201cdirection of trump? criminal tax fraud??\u201d\nEpstein responded: \u201cCareful. Max might call.\u201d\nIt is not clear who Max is or why Kahn should be careful.\nThe documents\nalso showed\nemails between Epstein and Core Club\u2019s co-founder Jennie Enterprise. Core Club, a members-only club popular with the ultra-rich and hedge funders, opened its doors in 2005 at East 55th Street.\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d Epstein wrote in a personal message to an unknown recipient in 2018, referring to Core Club\u2019s co-founders.\nCore Club, through a spokesperson, refuted the idea of Epstein\u2019s involvement.\n\u201c[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d the spokesperson said to\nTRD\nin an email.\n",

        "content": "A historic piece of Houston\u2019s skyline has dodged the auction block \u2014 at least for now.\nThe owner of the long-vacant Exxon-Mobil tower at 800 Bell Street wired more than $16 million in a last-minute payoff that halted a Dec. 2 foreclosure sale, resetting the clock on a troubled saga that\u2019s dragged through loan disputes, bankruptcy filings and a stalled redevelopment plan, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The reprieve doesn\u2019t solve the tower\u2019s structural and financial headaches, but it keeps a potential $35 million sale on the table, according to court records.\nChicago-based Sugar Pine Development has been circling the 45-story property and was expected to close on a deal by Dec. 5, though as of earlier this week it hadn\u2019t filed anything signaling it had backed away. The firm has begun assembling a redevelopment team, the filings show.\nThe 1.2 million-square-foot building \u2014 once the headquarters of Humble Oil, a predecessor to ExxonMobil \u2014 has been vacant since Exxon left for its Spring campus in 2015.\nThe tower\u2019s owner,\nBell Business Investments\n\u2014 an affiliate of New York\u2019s\nCMI Developers\n\u2014 is keeping its options open. A principal for the firm, Isaac Jacobowitz, told the outlet that they will either form the right team to revitalize the building or sell for a reasonable price. Asked whether a sale to Sugar Pine was imminent, he said both that deal and another buyer remain possible.\nThe legal fallout traces back to Bell Business\u2019 failed attempt to convert the 1960s-era office tower into a residential-heavy mixed-use complex. Its original lender\nsold the loan\nto an entity called 800 Bell Holdings, which declared a default in July and pushed for foreclosure this fall. Bell Business fought the claims, filing for bankruptcy in October to stall the sale, then withdrawing the case weeks later to pursue a transaction. When the sale didn\u2019t materialize, 800 Bell Holdings took another run at foreclosure.\nThe payoff \u2014 funded through a $13 million refinancing from Broadview Capital that matures in January 2027 \u2014 gives Bell Business roughly a year to land a buyer or revive a redevelopment plan. But the building\u2019s condition remains a major hurdle. Court filings describe water damage, broken windows, moldy drywall and moisture intrusion. A Harris County judge granted the lender access to perform emergency repairs, and its attorney said 40 workers completed roughly $380,000 worth of fixes. Questions about asbestos remediation linger, according to the journal.\nDowntown Houston\u2019s cadre of aging megatowers has proven tough to reposition even with interest from opportunistic buyers, and the\nExxon-Mobil\nbuilding is no exception.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "SL Green bought out its partner at 800 Third Avenue in a deal that values the 41-story office tower at $190 million.\nThe Marc Holliday-led REIT bought the 39.5 percent stake in the 1970s-era office building from Larry Wohl\u2019s Joseph P. Day, the company announced Friday.\nSL Green now owns 100 percent of the 750,000-square-foot property. Along with the buyout, the company modified and extended the tower\u2019s $177 million mortgage.\nChief Investment Officer Harry Sitomer said the transactions exemplify SL Green\u2019s long-term outlook on what the real estate firm considers to be well-located Midtown Manhattan assets.\n\u201cWe continue to see strong momentum on Third Avenue, with residential conversions helping reposition the corridor for strong office sector growth,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThere are a number of office conversions in the works along\nThird Avenue\n, which was hit hard with vacancies during the pandemic.\nNearby, SL Green is converting the tower it owns at 750 Third Avenue into 680 apartments. At\n845 Third Avenue\n, Rudin is turning the building into 411 units.\nThose projects, along with others in Midtown, have taken supply off the market and helped to improve conditions for the remaining office properties in the area.\nCurrent tenants at 800 Third include investment advisor Kimelman &amp; Baird, management firm Renaissance Technologies and law office Kobre &amp; Kim. Asking rent for a lease last January was in the mid-$70s per square foot, according to the Commercial Observer.\nSL Green acquired a stake in 800 Third Avenue in 2006, when it created a partnership with owners Joseph P. Day Realty Corp. and the estate of Norman Levy. That initial investment, valued at $102.4 million, came in the form of a loan secured by a 47 percent interest in the building. SL Green had the option to convert the mortgage into equity.\n",

The buyers borrowed $50.1 million from PGIM Real Estate. The price amounts to $315,455 per unit.\nTroy, New York-based United Group and Palm Beach Gardens-based Sina developed the complex, consisting of a pair of L-shaped buildings, in 2021, records show. It was developed on the 10.7-acre site of the Amara Shrine Center on RCA Boulevard, a fraternal organization.\nEverleigh consists of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments for tenants 55 and older, according to the community\u2019s website.\nApartments.com shows monthly rents range from $2,764 to $6,910, with Everleigh\u2019s website showing that tenants could get up to two months free for base rent.\nLed by Bob Faith, Greystar is an investment, development and management firm focusing on multifamily, including student and senior housing, and logistics properties, according to its website. It manages about 1.1 million multifamily units, and has roughly $79 billion of assets under management and $36 billion worth of development projects.\nIn January, it sold the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens apartment complex at 4310 Chukka Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County to Property Reserve, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate arm, for\n$102.4 million\n. Greystar then bought the 358-unit Avana at the Moors complex at 6200 Northwest 173rd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County for\n$93.5 million\n.\nIn May, Greystar picked up a 36-acre industrial development site approved for three warehouses at the corner of Lyons Road and Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek for\n$30.5 million\n.\nArtemis, an investment manager that\u2019s purchased more than $16 billion of real estate, was set to be\nacquired\nby Charlotte, North Carolina-based Barings in the first quarter of this year, according to its website. Financial terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed.\nThe Sunshine State has been a magnet for retirees for years, with South Florida senior housing generally enjoying continuing demand. (These communities offer independent, active living, which is different from facilities offering assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing.)\nInvestors and developers have taken note.\nIn January, AEW Capital Management bought the 424-unit senior living Welling Bay complex at\u00a0 2590 Wellington Bay Drive in Wellington for\n$100.1 million\n. Last year, Walton Street Capital bought the 136-unit Alamar Senior Living community at 8785 Lake Worth Road in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$23.5 million\n.\nDeveloper Lewis Swezy\u2019s Centennial Management plans an\n80-unit\nage-restricted rental building at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue, near Miami-Dade County\u2019s Earlington Heights Metrorail stop. The project will be for tenants 55 and older and earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income.\u00a0In January, Pinnacle proposed a\n110-unit\naffordable apartment project on the southeast corner of South Dixie Highway and Southwest 250th Street in Miami-Dade\u2019s Princeton neighborhood.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio Spurs legend and pro basketball hall of famer Tony Parker has cut the asking price of his Central Texas villa as its\nunusual marketing strategy\nfaces the test of a buyer\u2019s market.\nIn a bid to become \u201cthe most-talked about estate in America,\u201d as its listing website claims, the NBA star\u2019s home\nfamously hosted web celebrity Kai Cenat\nfor a month over the summer before going on the public market. Parker\u2019s agent, Houston broker Erwin Nicholas II, conceived of the marketing scheme after Cenat approached him to find a rental mansion for his act to use for a month-long performance event. Nicholas has since applied the same strategy to\nJeff Greene\u2019s Beverly Hills estate\nand its $195 million price tag.\nParker\u2019s home listed publicly in September for $20 million, and the price dropped on Saturday to $19.5 million, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nLike Greene\u2019s property,\nwhich was once the most expensive public listing in America\n, Parker\u2019s home has struggled to sell in the past. Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Binkan Cinaroglu, one of San Antonio\u2019s top luxury agents, represented the home previously.\nThe challenges continue.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we represent the opportunity to negotiate,\u201d Nicholas said of the price cut.\nParker launched his gambit during a downturn for Texas sellers, even in the luxury tier. In September,\nseven of the top 10 most expensive homes for sale in the state were relistings\n, representing an increasingly stagnant market compared to earlier months in 2025. In Central Texas, the San Antonio and Austin metro areas\nled the nation in canceled deals and home value loss\n, respectively, at different points in the year. Meanwhile,\nhome supply is rivaling post-recession levels\nthroughout the Texas Triangle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market right now. There\u2019s a lot of inventory, so something has to happen,\u201d Nicholas said when asked about predictions for 2026.\nLuxury custom properties such as Parker\u2019s \u2014 which features what marketing materials call a water park,\u201d among other amenities \u2014 tend to take longer to sell than more conventional luxury homes at the same price point, according to Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz, who specializes in selling ranches. As a result, it\u2019s difficult to assess yet whether Parker\u2019s lengthening number of days on market suggests that it\u2019s going stale.\n\u201cThere really is no one-size-fits-all. That said, if we list a unique property \u2026 we expect to complete a campaign for something unique and unusual in really no more than nine months,\u201d Uechtritz said.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be very hard to write a one-size-fits-all kind of opinion on days on the market. I mean, if something is there for a year or two, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\n",

The proposal heads to the county\u2019s Housing Committee next week.\nThe site, at 2200 and 2501 N.W. 57th Street, holds 144 public housing units built in 1965. Integra also has a small adjacent parcel under contract, which it aims to fold into the plan.\nMiami-Dade began shopping the property in 2023 as part of a broader push to modernize its public housing stock. These deals typically blend replacement public housing with deeper affordability and workforce units, but they require federal approval, adding time and complexity.\nIntegra estimates construction at $270.1 million, spread across three phases. The public housing delivered would allow all of the existing tenants to stay in place.\nThe unit mix is broad for a single site: 495 one-bedrooms, 187 two-bedrooms, 158 three-bedrooms and 65 four-bedroom townhomes. Income levels would range from extremely low-income to workforce, including 182 units at 30 percent of area median income, 270 at 60 percent, 272 at 80 percent and 181 at 120 percent.\nIntegra is padding the proposal with perks, including a fitness center, playground, 20 for-sale homes, a youth art center, 3,100 square feet of commercial space, an on-site police workstation, a 5 percent cut of developer fees for the Brownsville Civic Neighborhood Association and 10 percent of net cash flow for a local public art endowment.\nIntegra\u2019s principals \u2014 Victor Ballestas, Paulo Henrique Tavares de Melo, Jacob Conrad Morrow and Nelson Stabile \u2014 are expected to pursue state financing next year through the Florida Housing Finance Corp. The company could not be reached for comment.\nIf the proposal advances, the County Commission would vote in January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant corner of Glenview\u2019s office market is back in a developer\u2019s sight, with a local industrial player testing whether the suburb that has already absorbed one massive workspace-to-warehouse remake is willing to greenlight another.\nFormer Sterling Bay industrial chief Scott Gibbel plans to present his vision Dec. 10 to Glenview\u2019s New Development Commission to replace the mostly empty Caremark Towers with nearly 400,000 square feet of new warehouses, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. His newly launched firm,\nCurtis Ashton Partners\n, wants to level the two aging office buildings at 2211 Sanders Road and build a 29-acre, 395,000-square-foot industrial park dubbed O\u2019Hare Park 294, according to a village filing.\nThe concept mirrors \u2014 and expands on \u2014 a proposal Dermody Properties\nfloated in 2023\nfor a 300,000-square-foot complex on the same site. Dermody, the developer behind the industrial takeover of the 232-acre former Allstate campus just to the south, won commission approval but never secured a rezoning from the village board,\nThe Real Deal\nreported at the time. Rising interest rates killed Dermody\u2019s plan by year\u2019s end.\nGibbel\u2019s goes bigger by tacking on a vacant parcel along Interstate 294 that he aims to buy from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. His team says the project would serve \u201cshallow bay\u201d users \u2014 light manufacturers and R&amp;D tenants \u2014 who have been boxed out as developers chase bulk\nwarehouse demand\n. He hopes to start demolition this spring and deliver all three buildings by summer 2027, building on spec.\nStill, the market around him isn\u2019t exactly roaring. Dermody has struggled to fill portions of its Logistics Campus, envisioned at 3.2 million square feet at full buildout. And while Glenview planners liked the 2023 version of the Caremark plan, a core group of Mission Hills residents didn\u2019t. They\u2019re now reviving their opposition with an online petition ahead of next month\u2019s hearing on the Gibbel proposal.\nCaremark Towers\u2019\nfractured ownership\ndoesn\u2019t simplify matters. DTS Properties bought the taller building at 2211 Sanders Road for $2.3 million in 2022, while the Farbman Group picked up its neighbor at 2215 Sanders for $2.2 million. None of the owners or Gibbel are talking publicly.\nThe proposal reopens familiar fault lines for Glenview residents, as the village has watched residents push back on major redevelopment bids before, from a Core Spaces single-family rental plan to an apartment conversion of the nearby Renaissance hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Align Real Estate\u2019s plan to\nturn three Safeway sites\nacross San Francisco into housing is facing early opposition.\nThe local firm filed plans to develop a 25-story waterfront apartment complex on the site of a grocery store at 15 Marina Boulevard, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. But the project is already facing pushback from Mayor Daniel Lurie and\nridicule\nfrom Marina district residents.\nLurie\u2019s Family Zoning\nplan was approved this week, but Align filed its plans before that, using lenient state height guidelines for the 790-unit proposal. Lurie\u2019s plan allows heights of 140 to 350 feet in districts where it wants to encourage housing density but limits other areas to 65 to 85 feet.\nAlign\u2019s timing caught the attention of the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cA developer trying to sneak in a project before our plan takes effect is a complete violation of the spirit of that work,\u201d Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for Lurie, said. \u201cOur administration will stand up firmly to developers that game the system, and we will pull every lever we can to make this a project that works for this neighborhood and our city.\u201d\nAlign\u2019s plan for the 2.6-acre site includes 86 affordable units. The project would consist of two towers connected by a U-shaped center, rising 250 feet at its highest. It\u2019s a decrease in height from Align\u2019s original plans, which Lurie also opposed.\nThe development would reserve 63,000 square feet for a replacement Safeway, an increase from the existing store\u2019s 40,520 square feet. The development would have 473 residential parking spaces and 164 for the grocery store.\nLurie isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s opposed to the project; the neighborhood\u2019s supervisor, Stephen Sherrill, also intends to fight it.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it go unchallenged,\u201d Sherrill told the outlet. \u201cOur neighborhoods deserve stability and real rules \u2014 not to be blindsided by cartoonish mega-projects trying to exploit loopholes in state law.\u201d\nWhile the developer is not currently bound by the city\u2019s height and density limits at the site, the Family Zoning plan will target the Marina location in an attempt to shave down the project.\nAlign\u2019s other proposals call for similar transformation of Safeway sites into mixed-use towers. Those plans, revealed over the past month, include more than\n1,800 units at 1335 Webster Street\nin the Fillmore District, 526 units for the Safeway at 850 La Playa Street in the Outer Richmond and 370 units at the Safeway property at 3350 Mission Street in\nBernal Heights\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Frank O. Gehry\n, the architect behind some of the most recognizable commercial structures around the world, has died.\nThe architecture giant died at his home in Santa Monica, California at the age of 96, the New York Times\nreported\n. He was battling a brief respiratory illness prior to his death.\nGehry leaves behind a legacy of envisioning lively structures often characterized by undulating, silver accents, including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the New World Center concert hall in Miami Beach, the\n8 Spruce Street residential tower\nin New York City and the Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris.\nGehry was born in 1929 and raised in Toronto before moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1947. He studied architecture at the University of Southern California, graduating in 1954, and enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly thereafter. With the help of the G.I. Bill, he went on to study city planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.\nArmed with an education and passion for architecture, Gehry worked as a designer and project manager at Gruen Associates, a firm known for its shopping malls. He opened his own office in 1962 and spent much of his early career working for mainstream developers. Eventually, however, he developed his own style, wanting to buck many of the building trends of the time \u2014 something likely birthed out of being introduced to the work of Modernist pioneer Raphael Soriano during his studies.\n\u201cI was rebelling against everything,\u201d he told the Times in 2012.\nGehry became a household name \u2014 literally \u2014 nearly half a century ago with the construction of a home at 1002 22nd Street in\nSanta Monica\nthat he designed and lived in for four decades. He earned the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989 and left his mark around the globe with projects that include the Dancing House in Prague; the Biomuseo in Panama City; Maison Hennessy in Cognac, France; the Pierre Boulez Saal concert hall in Berlin; and the Louis Vuitton flagship store in\nSeoul\n. He was also one of the first architects to embrace computer design, and that tech pedigree synced up with Facebook when he designed its West Campus in Menlo Park, California.\nGehry is survived by his wife Berta Aguilera and their two sons, architectural designer Sam and artist Alejandro, as well as his daughter Brina Gehry from his previous marriage and his sister Doreen Gehry Nelson.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A Toll Brothers project to demolish an office complex in Warner Center and replace it with housing is moving forward.\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved a proposal from Toll Brothers to tear down offices at 6464 Canoga Avenue and build an eight-story building with 276 apartments and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nToll Brothers\u2019 development is the first project to take advantage of density bonus incentives in the Warner Center Specific Plan area. In exchange for increased density, the developer will be required to designate 21 apartments for very low-income households, or individuals\nmaking\na maximum of $53,000 annually and households of four making $75,750.\nThe offices were formerly the headquarters of animation studio Filmation. It\u2019s been vacant for decades, following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Seismic retrofitting for the property was determined to be too expensive.\nToll Brothers\u2019 presence in the multifamily market is evolving. In September, Kennedy Wilson\nacquired Toll Brothers\u2019 Apartment Living\narm for $347 million. Kennedy Wilson secured Toll Brothers\u2019 general partner interests in 18 multifamily and student housing assets worth approximately $2.2 billion, as well as a 29-property development pipeline worth approximately $3.6 billion of investment.\nThe Canoga Avenue project isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in the works in Warner Center. In September, Meta Housing Corporation\nsubmitted an application\nto build affordable apartments for senior citizens at 21010 Vanowen Street. That proposal similarly calls for demolishing a one-story office building and accompanying parking lot to make way for a six-story building boasting 395 apartments for low- and moderate-income households.\nEarlier this year, billionaire developer and Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke\nunveiled plans\nto build a 100-acre team headquarters, residential and retail entertainment hub in Warner Center. That project, dubbed Rams Village at Warner Center, is expected to boost foot traffic and density at the master-planned business district in Canoga Park and Woodland Hills.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

City Council approved $2.2 million in sales tax incentives for the project, which is being developed by Gillum Development and Seal Family Properties.\nDeputy City Manager Jordan Matney told council the project \u201cmost likely not moved forward\u201d without the boost from the city, the outlet reported. The incentives package will provide a $700,000 reimbursement for public improvements and $1.5 million for the developer after the project receives its certificate of occupancy. The city estimates the project will provide a $1.58 million net benefit to the city over a decade.\nThe four-story project will rise at 699 West San Antonio Street, which is currently home to an 18,000-square-foot retail and warehouse building built in the 1950s. The Neue will feature 43 condo units and about 5,000 square feet of ground-level retail and office space.\nNew Braunfels is about 33 miles northeast of San Antonio. It\u2019s known for its German heritage. It draws visitors who like to tube or float along the Comal and Guadalupe rivers. Like other towns in the region between Austin and San Antonio, New Braunfels\u2019 population is growing rapidly. Since 2000, its\npopulation has surged\nfrom 38,000 to more than 100,000 people.\nThe development of The Neue speaks to\nTexas\u2019 burgeoning condo market\n. Unlike cities like New York and Miami, the Lone Star State doesn\u2019t have many condo buildings, as luxury buyers have traditionally favored the ranch.\nDevelopers in the Houston area are testing the waters. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing the\nstate\u2019s first standalone Ritz-Carlton condo building\nin The Woodlands. When construction started on the 111-unit project, 69 percent of the units were pre-sold.

        "content": "In New York City, millions of New Yorkers apply to the Housing Preservation and Development for the slim odds of scoring an affordable apartment.\nBut those odds are still better than those for rent-stabilized buildings applying to HPD for financial relief. In November, HPD deferred every application for an Article XI property tax exemption under its Housing Preservation Opportunity program until February, citing project capacity, according to an e-mail exchange shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The agency said in the email exchange that it received over 75 applications in the fall and will select a limited number of projects in February.\nHPD\u2019s program website states that it has \u201climited staff capacity and a significant backlog of projects. As a result, the assignment of a project manager can take up to one year.\u201d\nAn HPD spokesperson said the agency has not seen a significant increase in applicants over the last few years.\nThe program grants exemptions of up to 40 years on a needs basis for rent-stabilized portfolios with dwindling cash flows. Applicants have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops, like forming a housing development fund corporation, and HPD evaluates projects based on factors like their financials, their level of affordability and vacancy and potential repairs.\nBuildings also agree to other conditions, like keeping all units rent-stabilized, limiting rents and incomes and accepting a homeless set-aside filled from vacancies. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious preservation tool, not a light-touch tax break,\u201d said Belkin Burden Goldman\u2019s David Shamshovich.\nApplicants walk a tricky line. Show too robust an operation, and HPD will likely put its money towards the needier; but show a portfolio on the precipice of foreclosure and HPD might resist throwing good money after bad.\nIn the case of the most recent set of applications, none of those considerations appeared to matter, as they were all stymied by what seems like yet another understaffed city organization.\nShamshovich submitted several applications for the fall term, all of which will now be considered next year. One of them related to a 400-unit portfolio with all rents below the 50 percent area median income that is struggling due to its rising debt service.\nHis team submitted a host of paperwork, including a line-item capital budget showing the building\u2019s need for roughly $1.7 million in near-term work to keep the building up to code.\nHe summed up the state of affairs thusly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for the city, and it saves these buildings and preserves them, but if you don\u2019t have bodies to process them, then they\u2019re essentially unhelpful.\u201d\nAnd despite the building meticulously filing all of the paperwork, the decision has been postponed while the building\u2019s finances continue to suffer.\nThe backlog comes during what has been a nightmarish period for rent-stabilized building owners, who have already had many of the levers to manage their balance sheets pulled out from them with the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.\nWith the soaring costs of insurance, utilities and interest rates alongside a new mayor likely pushing for a rent freeze on rent-stabilized buildings, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Article XI applications only increase going forward.\nThose owners might as well start checking their Powerball numbers instead.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: After reporting that billionaire Larry Ellison bought two apartments from Shari Redstone at the Pierre,\nThe Real Deal\nlearned that the co-op sale was part of the broader Skydance Media and Paramount merger. Now that we have another massive media merger between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see any other house swaps as part of the deal. Know of any homes used as deal sweeteners? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: I had always assumed that avoiding New York taxes was as easy as spending your 183 days elsewhere (Florida, most likely). But this\nNew York Times article\nshed some light on the extent to which the tax auditors will go to catch town-skippers. Auditors caught one fishing enthusiast who said that he was a New York resident to get a $25 discount on his state fishing license (ultimately, he won his case but paid more in legal fees than he saved on the license).\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Stricter safety regulations are coming for cranes, Gothamist\nreported\n. City officials said they are going to begin requiring diesel-powered tower cranes to have fire suppression and detection systems after determining the 2023 Midtown crane collapse was caused by a fire started on the crane\u2019s deck. Crane operators will also need to meet higher qualification requirements.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he will end homeless encampment sweeps, The City\nreported\n. The city spent $6.4 million on the sweeps since 2024; of the 3,500 people who were moved out of encampments, 114 (3 percent) were placed in shelters.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deals recorded Friday were\n1010 East Eighth Street\nin Ocean Parkway and\n1289 Lexington Avenue, 19B\nin Carnegie Hill, both for $8 million. The Ocean Parkway single-family home is 2,600 square feet. The Carnegie Hill condo is 3,500 square feet of new construction.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nJill Bernard has the listing for the condo.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$38.1 million\nfor 26 Bleecker Street. The Manhattan Health Center in NoHo is seven stories and 43,365 square feet. Planned Parenthood sold the building to Izaki Group Investments, per\nproperty records\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 15 Renwick Street, Unit TH3. The Hudson Square condo triplex is 3,500 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 104,970-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use development at 54 Sullivan Place in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A handful of towers in Sunny Isles Beach are sinking much more than expected, raising questions about whether monitoring settlement should be a requirement across South Florida\u2019s barrier islands.\nThe\nMiami Herald\nexamined dozens of engineering reports covering the majority of the city skyline. Experts told the publication that it\u2019s difficult to determine how much newer towers will settle in Sunny Isles Beach.\nAfter buildings are completed, they typically settle into the ground, but unexpected sinking that\u2019s excessive or uneven can create problems over time. Those issues include cracked pipes and facades, and doors, windows and floors that become uneven.\nFor newer towers under construction in Sunny Isles, which include Dezer Development\u2019s Bentley Residences and the two-tower St. Regis Residences, the foundations can extend up to 20 stories below ground \u2014 200 feet. Dezer secured a\n$630 million construction loan\nfor the project from Madison Realty Capital last month. And Bank OZK boosted the construction financing for Fortune International Group and Ch\u00e2teau Group\u2019s St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to\n$418.3 million\n.\nNone of the experts the newspaper interviewed suggested any immediate concerns of structural or safety issues. But no one is monitoring how towers settle and shift after they are completed and what effect that is having on neighboring buildings.\nNearly three dozen buildings from Miami Beach to Sunny Isles Beach are sinking at \u201cunexpected\u201d rates,\nresearchers found\nin a University of Miami study published a year ago.\nThe buildings identified included the\nFour Seasons Residences\nat the Surf Club in Surfside, and in Sunny Isles, the Porsche Design Tower and Estates at Acqualina. The study relied on satellite images over the seven-year period that used reference points such as building balconies, air conditioning units and boardwalks to measure the buildings\u2019 shifts, and looked at the skyline from 2016 to 2023.\nSubsidence, or sinking, ranging from two to eight centimeters (less than an inch to about three inches) was found, with the most significant effects in Sunny Isles.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "He may not have lived to see his $1 billion-plus vision to\nupgrade the Los Angeles River\ncome to fruition, but architect Frank Gehry was able to shepherd through a transformational plan that is slated to reimagine one of the West Coast\u2019s most underused natural features.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done almost everything you can possibly do as an architect,\u201d Bill Witte, head of Related Companies\u2019 California arm, previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cBut if something successful would emerge from this \u2014 and it looks like it might \u2014 it\u2019s an incredible legacy.\u201d\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Gehry was involved in numerous projects at the time of his\ndeath Friday\nin Santa Monica at the age of 96. A Pritzker Prize-winning architect, Gehry personally designed every project completed by his firm, Gehry Partners.\nThough not the building he will be most remembered for \u2014 which is likely the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain \u2014 Gehry put Los Angeles on the global stage with his innovative Walt Disney Concert Hall. Completed in 2003, the Downtown L.A. cultural destination, home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is notably punctuated by stainless steel sail-like forms. A tourist destination, tours are offered at the site almost daily.\nGehry is also responsible for a myriad of other projects like The Grand LA, Related California\u2019s two-tower, mixed-used development across from the Disney Concert Hall; and Panama City\u2019s Biomuseo.\nA contemporary icon, Gehry was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. He moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947, and\nchanged his name\nto Gehry from Goldberg for professional purposes as he faced anti-Semitism.\nThe architect, known for breaking architectural norms and seeing buildings as sculptures, worked for Victor Gruen Associates while finishing his architecture degree at the University of Southern California.\nHe spent a year in the U.S. army in 1955 before studying urban planning at Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design. He worked briefly at Pereira and Luckman Associates and then rejoined Victor Gruen Associates. He moved to Paris with his family in 1961 and worked with Andr\u00e9 Remondet. Gehry opened Frank O Gehry and Associates in Santa Monica in 1962. Gehry Partners, based in Los Angeles, was formed in 2001.\nOne of his most famous early projects was his personal home at 1002 22nd Street in Santa Monica, in which he lived for four decades. The 1978 home incorporated unconventional materials like chain-link fencing, corrugated metal and plywood. The house became known as Gehry\u2019s earliest Deconstructivist building, though he continued making a number of additions.\nCritics saw Gehry\u2019s\nearly, rough-edged work as combative\n\u2014 Mike Davis famously dubbed it \u201cDirty Harry architecture\u201d \u2014 but Gehry viewed it as a pushback against the elitist pursuit of purity that dominated 20th-century design, according to The New York Times. As digital tools emerged, his architecture grew more sculptural. He said\n\u201carchitecture is art.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Gehry was \u2018good at\u2019 was making architecture that both inspired thought and brought pleasure, making buildings that were unusual enough so that some confused them with art pieces and others found them merely bizarre,\u201d architecture critic Paul wrote in \u201cBuilding Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry,\u201d\nGehry had been working on an 82,000-square-foot flagship store for Louis Vuitton in Beverly Hills, and the conversion of a 1960s building into an exhibition space and events hall in Paris.\nIn New York City, his first building was for Barry Diller, designing IAC\u2019s headquarters at 555 West 18th Street. Goldberger wrote in his biography of Gehry that Diller was wary that Gehry could keep costs down, but the architect prevailed in convincing him that he could \u201cboth be reasonable and produce a building for reasonable cost.\u201d\nGoldberger wrote that Gehry faced a similar challenge at Forest City Ratner\u2019s 8 Spruce Street, which had to be economical, but also compelling: \u201cIt had to be Frank Gehry, but not\ntoo\nFrank Gehry.\u201d\nThe building, known as Beekman Tower and New York by Gehry, was the tallest residential tower in North America when it opened in 2011. Its height, at 870 feet, was not all that drew the eye: Ten thousand steel panels make up the building\u2019s undulating facade, meant to evoke the sculptural lines of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n\u201cWe helped bring to life what was then the most ambitious residential tower ever built in Lower Manhattan \u2014 a building that proved daring architecture and large-scale development could coexist, elevate one another and redefine the skyline,\u201d developer MaryAnne Gilmartin, who was at Forest City Ratner when Gehry designed 8 Spruce Street, said in a statement to\nTRD\n.\nOf course, sometimes cost can interfere with such ethos. Forest City originally hired Gehry as the master planner of the Brooklyn megadevelopment then\nknown as Atlantic Yards\n, but ultimately replaced him in 2009, scrapping his designs for the Barclays Center and a gleaming office tower, dubbed \u201cMiss Brooklyn.\u201d At the time, developer Bruce Ratner\ncited\nan economic downturn, rising construction costs and litigation against the project.\u00a0\u00a0But Gilmartin said Gehry\u2019s work still influenced Brooklyn\u2019s transformation, by reimagining\u00a0 \u201cwhat large, complex urban redevelopment could be: ambitious, integrated and rooted in creating a multi-generational neighborhood.\u201d\n",

In September, Ashkenazy\u2019s partner\nAurora Capital Associates\nironed out a $98\u202fmillion debt package that was coming due in order to keep control of the 300,000\u2011square\u2011foot retail chunk at 700\u202fNorth Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. While it\u2019s unclear whether Ashkenazy\u2019s ownership stake was changed by the transaction, the firm\u2019s focus in the Chicago area has been transitioning away from the urban core.\nAshkenazy this year raised a\n$750\u202fmillion war chest for acquisitions\n, largely from his own funds with backing from prior investors, to target retail and hospitality assets \u2014 especially those with overleveraged owners forced to sell at steep discounts.\nThat capital may now be deploying into properties like\nOrland Park\n, where a strong tenant roster and affluent suburban catchment area offer a steadier cash\u2011flow story than distressed downtown retail. Ashkenazy also purchased a retail property on\nChicago\u2019s Far North Side\nnear Evanston in 2023 for $22 million.\nOrland Park Place\u2019s mix of national retailers, discounters and steady foot traffic stands in contrast to the volatility that\u2019s plagued large downtown retail landlords, many of whom have wrestled with tenant departure, loan defaults or writing off underperforming assets.\nFor Ashkenazy, the purchase may signal a recalibrated retail thesis: rather than double down on vertical retail in a troubled downtown \u2014 where the firm already\ndefaulted on a $61\u202fmillion loan\ntied to another Magnificent Mile asset in 2024 \u2014 it is quietly building a suburban platform anchored by stable shopping centers.\nPMAT initially purchased Orland Park Place for $74.6 million in March 2024, based on Cook County property records. Because the recent sale to Ashkenazy, as reported by the seller\u2019s broker Mid-America Real Estate, did not encompass the outlots on LaGrange Road, the final price is estimated to be similar to what PMAT paid for the specific area included in the transaction, the outlet reported.\n\u2014Sam Lounsberry\n",

Sunset Development Company, the developer of the Bishop Ranch master-planned community, was the seller.\nThe price amounts to $5.35 million per acre.\nVirginia-based AvalonBay plans to build a 456-unit housing development known as Avalon San Ramon. The project, at 6200 Bollinger Canyon Road, will have five- and seven-story buildings connected by a breezeway, plus a rooftop deck, fitness center, pool and pet spa.\nConstruction is expected to begin by the end of this month, with the goal to open for residents by 2027. Sunset Development and AvalonBay\nreceived approval\nfor the project last year.\nWhile Bishop Ranch has seen several housing developments take shape in recent years, Avalon San Ramon will be one of the few to rise on vacant land.\nThe project is one of several in the works at Bishop Ranch. The City of San Ramon approved the first-ever 100 percent affordable housing project at Bishop Ranch in October. That\nproject from Eden Housing\ncalls for building 200 units on a 2.2-acre site at 2453 Camino Ramon, currently home to a 10,000-square-foot service center.\nMeanwhile, Sunset Development Company has some housing projects of its own in the works at Bishop Ranch. The owner and developer\nplans to demolish\n761,000 square feet of office space to make way for two residential communities.\nThat project requires the razing of the three-building, 652,000-square-foot Canopy office complex at 3000-5000 Executive Parkway and replacing it with a 412-unit residential community of 255 detached townhomes and a five-story, 157-unit apartment building, as well as the demolition of a 109,000-square-foot office building at 2 Annabel Lane to build 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units.\nSunset Development has so far announced plans for 5,000 units at Bishop Ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

More on that in a bit.\nBut in business news there was a deal this week you probably won\u2019t read about at book fairs across the country.\nTony Malkin\u2019s Empire State Realty Trust is\nin contract\nto buy the Scholastic Building in Soho for $386 million, the company announced Tuesday.\nThe publisher owns the building at 555-557 Broadway and leases the majority of the space, which includes 368,000 square feet of office and 28,000 square feet of retail along Soho\u2019s prime shopping corridor.\nMalkin said he was attracted to the property for its in-place revenue and the ability to add value by marketing the \u201cthree uniquely large floors in a more than 110,000 square feet block.\u201d\nScholastic put the property up for sale earlier this year\n, eyeing a sale-leaseback deal. The public company reportedly planned to use the proceeds from the sale for \u201ccapital allocation priorities,\u201d reducing its debt and repurchasing shares.\nThe company bought the property in 2014\nfor $255 million\nfrom South Carolina-based landlord ISE America, which had\u00a0 since 1996.\nBilly Macklowe\u2019s career hasn\u2019t always been academic, but his bets are never dull. He recently completed construction of a\nmixed-use development\nin Park Slope, his first Brooklyn development and also developed a 52-unit condo building at\n21 East 12th Street\n.\nNext up? His William Macklowe Company\nacquired\nthe $46 million distressed loan note on the 129,000-square-foot, 10-story office building at 291 Broadway from Flagstar Bank.\nThe sale occurred after Flagstar sued the owner, Sutton Management, for foreclosure in July because of missed payments.\nThe building could be a candidate for a residential conversion if Macklowe forecloses or takes a deed-in-lieu.\nConversions are always a gamble. So is gambling. Luckily for dice rollers, the endgame for New York\u2019s gaming business is coming into focus.\nThe state Gaming Facility Location Board\nrecommended\ncasino licenses for the three remaining proposals in Queens and the Bronx: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe level of investment for each bid dictates the license term: Metropolitan Park and Resorts World qualify for 20-year licenses, while Bally\u2019s qualifies for a 15-year license.\nThe proposals, which included plans for hotels, entertainment venues and a focus on \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d next go to the Gaming Commission for final license issuance. That\u2019s expected to happen by the end of the month.\nYes, casinos are in a New York state of mind. Nas, famed rapper and Resorts World partner said it best after the recommendations were released: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day in New York City.\u201d\nFinally, the Epstein connection to real estate.\nThe late and disgraced financier privately\nclaimed\nin 2018 to have \u201chelped put them in biz,\u201d and by \u201cthem\u201d he meant Core Club founders Jennie and Dangene Enterprise, an allegation a spokesperson publicly refuted as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\nEmails released by the House Committee \u2014 a 20,000-page trove of documents \u2014 suggest a personal relationship between Epstein and Jennie Enterprise.\nThe invite-only Core Club caters to powerful clientele in real estate and finance, including figures like RFR\u2019s Aby Rosen and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.\n\u201c\u200b\u200b[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d said a spokesperson for Core Club.\nEpstein, as it turns out, was also\na reader of The Real Deal\n. While his interest in our publication is by no means a point of pride, released documents revealed emails with links to\nTRD\narticles,\nwhich appears to be a saved or printed web story from June 2019. The emails and articles touched on a Palm Beach development deal.\n",

        "content": "Luxury real estate is entering new territory in Chicagoland, but record-setting prices aren\u2019t necessarily boosting prospects of all sellers as several high-end deals resulted in losses.\nNovember brought about another record-setting home sale for Chicago, along with the movement of some long-sitting downtown condos as the usually sleepy holiday season approached.\nA\n16,000-square-foot mansion\nat 609 Sheridan Road in Winnetka fetched $32.5 million in the most expensive home resale in Illinois history on Nov. 19. The buyers paid $2 million more for personal property in the home, for a total price of $34.5 million.\nThe home was sold by Walton Street Capital co-founder Jeff Quicksilver and his wife, Ashley, who owns the Athene fashion boutique in Winnetka. The Quicksilvers had the French Provincial style home built in 2017.\nThe sale marked another win for @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay, who represented both sides on the deal. Radnay set the previous record just a few months ago with the sale of another\nWinnetka lakefront house for $31.3 million\n.\nRadnay has represented one or both parties on the top six most expensive Cook County home sales this year, leveraging her expertise of the North Shore lakefront to close deals. The demand for luxury lakefront homes in the ritzy northern suburbs has hit a fever pitch in the last year, pushing prices to numbers rarely seen in the Midwest.\nElsewhere,\nLake Geneva\nsaw its strong fall continue into November, with three waterfront houses trading there for more than $6 million.\nYet the luxury condo market in downtown Chicago is still struggling.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the biggest residential deals closed in November and what they show about the market.\nLake Geneva continues rally\nLeading the list of luxury Lake Geneva sales in November was a 7,100-square-foot house at\n831 Bayview Drive\n.\nThe home sold in a quiet, off-market transaction for $8.3 million on Nov. 17. The buyers didn\u2019t come from far: Philip and Melody Lekousis, who bought the house, sold a 3,300-square-foot house on Park Drive for $6 million earlier that month, trading up for the bigger Bayview Drive house.\nCompass agent Daniel Oleston represented the sellers, and Wendy Murphy with Mahler Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyers.\nThe sale rounded out a busy fall as several lakefront homes hit the market in Lake Geneva, taking advantage of surging demand for luxury property near Chicago. The house was the seventh lakefront home to sell there since October, and the fourth to fetch a price of more than $8 million.\nIn addition to the Lekousis\u2019 Park Drive house, a lakefront property at 8 Hillside Drive in Lake Geneva sold for $7.4 million last month.\nWilliam Farley cuts losses downtown\nAfter two years on the market and a series of price chops, former Fruit of the Loom CEO William Farley and his wife Shelley finally\nunloaded their spacious Gold Coast\npenthouse for $7.5 million, less than half of their original $16 million asking price.\nThe 12,000-square-foot co-op on the 14th floor of 209 East Lake Shore Drive sold for $625 per-square-foot. The sprawling penthouse is a combination of two units Farley bought decades ago. The penthouse had been on the market since 2022.\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe represented the seller, and Katherine Malkin, also of Compass, represented the buyer. They declined to comment on the buyer, and the buyer\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been determined through public records.\nThe sale comes as downtown Chicago is struggling to find its footing after years of weak demand and falling prices. Sellers like the Farleys have had to cut their asking prices, sometimes by millions of dollars to find buyers.\nBut interest is starting to come back to downtown and condos can find buyers if they\u2019re priced right. Lowe said the unit went under contract fairly quickly once it hit its last $7.9 million asking price.\nThat interest was reinforced in early December when billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s 67th\u2013floor condo at 800 North Michigan Avenue went under contract with a buyer, with an asking price of $12.5 million. The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet, but if it closes at the asking price it would be the most expensive sale for a single condo in downtown Chicago in at least three years.\nZach Lavine leaves No. 9 Walton\nZach LaVine was another downtown seller to\ntake a loss last month\n. The former Chicago Bulls star sold his lavish condo at 9 West Walton Street for $6.4 million, taking a half-million dollar loss on the sale.\nLaVine, who was traded to the Sacramento Kings in February, bought the 28th-floor condo from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack for $6.9 million in 2022. The 4,500-square-foot unit, which features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace and a custom tub with a built-in champagne bucket, is the latest turnover in a building that has become a hot spot for some of the most high-profile Chicago residents.\nGriffin also took a loss at the building in the last year. He sold off the top four floors of the building last year after making his exit from Chicago for Miami, and two of those units were bought by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\nFormer Blackhawks star Patrick Kane also sold his 25th-floor condo there for $6.4 million earlier this year.\n",

        "content": "Christmas miracle?\nVictor Coleman\u2019s real estate investment trust, where\nlosses\nare ballooning, made two early December announcements: Jon Bortz became a board member, and the company sold a Los Angeles office campus to tenant Riot Games at a price that permits it to repay the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the real estate.\nBortz, chairman and chief executive of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, replaced Jonathan Glaser on the board. Bortz founded the hotel REIT and added LaSalle Hotel Properties to Pebblebrook\u2019s holdings after a spirited bidding war with Blackstone back in pre-pandemic days.\nBortz saw total compensation of $7.4 million last year compared to Coleman\u2019s take of\nabout $25 million\n. He\u2019ll close the gap just a bit with his new gig, getting a $40,000 annual cash retainer, plus $20,000 as an audit and compensation committees member.\nNow for the Olympic Boulevard\ndeal\n\u2026 Hudson Pacific sold a 248,000 square foot, five-building office campus at 12333 West Olympic Boulevard for $150 million and got an extra $81 million payment for the termination of Riot Games\u2019 existing lease. The video-game developer picked up transfer taxes, which came to more than $8 million under the City of L.A.\u2019s Measure ULA rate of 5.5 percent for commercial deals over $10.6 million.\nThe total take, in any case, came to $231 million, giving Hudson Pacific cushion on the $206 million debt it was carrying. The firm increased its funds from operations outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $0.15 to $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.01 to $0.05, partly on the news.\nThe deal at $150 million comes out to about $605 per square foot, but with the bonus payment on the lease cancellation it comes out to $931 per square foot. That\u2019s more than Kilroy Realty recently\ndropped\non Maple Plaza, the Beverly Hills office campus that at a $205 million purchase price came out to around $700 per square foot. Even at $605 a square foot, it\u2019s more than the second priciest office deal in all of West Los Angeles during the third quarter per CBRE: Kilroy\u2019s $40 million\nsale\nof a Santa Monica property, which was around $500 per square foot.\nBofA Plaza makes 3 for Brookfield distress\nIn Brookfield land, Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to Bank of America Plaza, which the landlord once owned but lost to a receiver. The brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids to the $400 million debt balance.\nThe 1.4 million square foot, 57-story downtown Los Angeles tower at 333 South Hope Street is worth $212.5 million, or about $150 per square foot, based on recent assessments. That compares with $605 million value a decade ago. The latest distressed debt offering is one of three currently tied to Brookfield in DTLA these days, with the paper on the EY Plaza and the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower also on the block.\nFamily ties\nRemember the five brothers who emigrated from India, amassed a fortune in diamonds and Los Angeles real estate, then embroiled in a two-decade legal brouhaha that ended in a $10 billion verdict?\nOld habits die hard.\nTwo Jogani brothers, Rajesh and Chetan, are\nsuing\ntheir niece and nephew for $775 million. The two allege the younger relatives were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother, Haresh.\nLast year, Haresh was ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan, and their other brothers, to settle a dispute over their sprawling San Fernando Valley real estate portfolio. Now Rajesh and Chetan claim their brother made payments to his children, their niece and nephew to siphon off and hide assets from the real estate businesses.\nThe juicy complaint throws out accusations of \u201clooted\u201d money, \u201cunfettered control,\u201d \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct. Will it become another decades-long legal brawl?\nNewsom in New York\nCalifornia\u2019s ambitiously charismatic Governor Gavin Newsom \u2014 in a typical blue suit and open-collared crisp white shirt \u2014 appeared to have his next campaign in mind when he appeared at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit. But he barely touched on the most pressing problem of his current job: An intertwining homeless and housing crisis in the Golden State.\nNewsom took a page from President Donald Trump\u2019s handbook, claiming his critics have \u201cCalifornia derangement syndrome.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never tackled our housing crisis more aggressively than we tackled it last year,\u201d he later said.\nAlas, there were no follow-up questions to Newsom on the results of his efforts.\n",

        "content": "For New York City\u2019s new development market, 2025 has been a year of whisper trades and low inventory.\nWhile a handful of buzzy sales launches powered the market, executives, brokers and data analysts spent the year warning of an imminent inventory cliff, as demand for quality projects continued to significantly outpace supply.\n\u201cThe overall story is continuing to just whittle down on the inventory,\u201d said\nMarketproof\nco-founder Kael Goodman. \u201cThe total number of units is growing so slowly.\u201d\nThe market still had its fair share of highs.\nPerhaps the buzziest new development launch kicked off with little fanfare in early spring, when the sales team at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital started\nquietly inking deals\nfor condos at the development.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d said Goodman.\nThough some agents have described the West Village project as \u201cthe big one everyone is interested in,\u201d details about its sales progress have so far remained a tightly-guarded secret.\nThe few specifics that have surfaced have largely been through brokers\u2019 social media posts boasting about bringing buyers to the building, including last month when Bespoke\nposted on Instagram\nabout signing a contract for Unit 24, asking $31 million.\nInstagram also gave us the first hint of deals at the Flatiron Building conversion, another hotly anticipated project in Manhattan. Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold\nclaimed credit\nfor representing the first buyer to sign a contract at the building in an October post to his account. About a month later, Unit 3North, asking\n$19.4 million\n, landed among the top two most expensive deals inked in Manhattan that week.\nAnother notable pending deal was at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street, which found a buyer for its penthouse asking\n$88 million\n. If the unit closes at that price, it would break the record for the priciest condo deal in Downtown Manhattan.\nFor other projects, 2025 was the year of the comeback.\nDeals at 111 West 57th Street had been slow before Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team took over sales last summer. Since then, condos at the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall, developed by JDS Development and Property Markets Group, have been routinely\namong the two priciest\npending deals noted in weekly contract reports. The tower notched $400 million in sales this year and is 95 percent sold, according to a spokesperson.\nAnother Midtown project has also picked up steam after roughly a decade on the market. In October, 53 West 53rd Street, known as the MoMA tower, nabbed a buyer for Unit 65, last asking\n$47 million\n.\nAcross the East River, two rival new developments in Williamsburg have been vying for neighborhood price records, \u00a0with deals at Two Trees\u2019 One Domino Square and Naftali Group\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf continuously one-upping each other for the priciest condo deals per square foot. Both buildings are now just below 65 percent sold, according to data from Marketproof.\nUnderneath the highlights ran an undercurrent of concerns about the waning inventory pipeline in Manhattan.\n\u201cThe inventory situation is going to continue to get worse, it\u2019s not going to get better,\u201d said Corcoran Sunshine\u2019s Kelly Mack.\nBut the shrinking options aren\u2019t an upside for buildings that have been struggling to offload units, Mack said. Instead, those buyers are turning to the resale market or waiting for a new project to start selling.\n\u201cSeveral amazing new development properties that have recently come to market, or will in the first half of the year, will be beneficiaries of the current market dynamic,\u201d Mack said. The lack of inventory \u201ccreates a sense of urgency to act quickly on those properties.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nRyan Serhant\u2019s \u201cOwning Manhattan\u201d is back on Netflix.\nThe\nsecond season\nof the reality TV series premiered on Friday with eight episodes available on the streaming service. The show features a few new faces, including Peter Zaitzeff, who joined Serhant last January and took over sales at 200 Amsterdam for the brokerage.\nThe Real Deal\n, along other reporters, editors and influencers, got a sneak peek of the new season on Wednesday night at an event hosted by Serhant at Zero Bond. Members of the media, with cocktails and buckets of popcorn, cozied up on couches at the private club to watch the first episode, alongside the cast of the show.\n\u201cNot everyone lives in this season,\u201d Serhant, clad in a pale pink suit, said, calling back to a scene in the first season where he fired his former agent, Jonathan Normolle.\nIn response to a question about his leadership style, Serhant veered into an explanation of how the show came to be, alluding to a bidding war between Netflix and other streaming services.\n\u201cA lot of other people in real estate who have TV shows and don\u2019t anymore lost to us,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t your question.\u201d\nCast member Jordan Hurt described the new season as a \u201cdeeper dive into everyone\u2019s personal and professional story.\u201d Jessica Markowski added that she hoped to change her perception this time after she was painted as a villain last season for recording a podcast with Normolle making fun of some of their colleagues.\n\u201cIt was something I wasn\u2019t really proud of,\u201d Markowski said. \u201cSeason two, I really focused on business first and foremost and really proving to Ryan and the company that I can do this.\u201d\n\u201cComing in and getting, you know, beat up a little,\nThe brokerage hosted its official premiere party on Friday at Terminal 5 on West 56th Street.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was a penthouse at 443 Greenwich Street, which sold for just under\n$40 million\n. Unit PHG once belonged to Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, who bought the apartment for $20 million in 2017 and sold it five years later for $29 million.\nThe 5,300-square-foot condo has four bedrooms and a 2,650-square-foot wraparound terrace.\u00a0 Corcoran\u2019s Noble Black had the listing.\n",
