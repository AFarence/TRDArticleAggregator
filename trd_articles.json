        "content": "Senate Bill 79\n, the landmark legislation allowing for transit-oriented upzoning across the state, is now officially on the law books. But\nnot all officials are happy\n.\nDespite Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature of the bill last week, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass isn\u2019t thrilled about the mandate coming down from Sacramento, The Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\n\u201cThe rigid timelines and limited flexibility for alternative plans set forth in SB 79 create unnecessary burdens for Los Angeles communities,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhile I support the legislation\u2019s intent to accelerate housing development statewide, the bill as written diminishes neighborhood input on planning and zoning.\u201d\nBass\nwas joined in dissent\nby Los Angeles Councilwoman Traci Park, who last month said that SB 79 \u201copens the floodgates to developers, displacement and gentrification.\u201d The new law allows for the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile.\nPark said the legislation would allow multi-story residential buildings to rise \u201cwith no regard for impacts on traffic, infrastructure, the environment, evacuation routes, public safety, quality of life or community character.\u201d\nBefore passing the California legislature, lawmakers shaved down the proposal\u2019s reach significantly. Only eight of California\u2019s 58 counties are eligible for SB 79-related upzoning, with efforts focused in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nContra Costa County barely escaped enforcement\nthanks to specific language in the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s not just local politicians who are upset or nervous about how it will all play out, either.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. One-size-fits-all does not work,\u201d Annette Mercer, a longtime resident of West Los Angeles\u2019 Rancho Park, told the Journal. \u201cHowever, maintaining single-family homes forever when we have a homeless issue doesn\u2019t work either.\u201d\nThe\npush and pull between local and state governments\nis nothing new, though Newsom\u2019s signing of SB 79 is the latest instance of local control over zoning and construction being lost to state mandates. As California works to meet its housing crisis, Newsom and other officials, such as SB 79 author Scott Wiener, have been working to increase building and cut red tape wherever possible.\nIn July, for example, Newsom\nsigned a landmark rollback of the California Environmental Quality Act\n. Environmental reviews under CEQA for many projects would gum up the approval process, but now developers for most infill projects in the state will be able to bypass such approvals.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Brokers Kurt Sarbaugh and John Huguenard are leading the listing. The asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe vacant property includes 571,000 square feet of warehouse space on\ntwo levels\n, plus ramps and parking decks that can hold 1,590 cars or 763 vans.\nBuilt speculatively on the edge of Goose Island, the facility represented a major bet on the next generation of\nlogistics design\n\u2014 a\nvertical model\npopular in Asia and Europe but still rare in the U.S. outside coastal markets such as Seattle, New York and San Francisco.

The developer paid more than $55 million for the land and secured $150 million in construction financing before construction in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are pursuing all opportunities with this development, including lease or sale, offering flexibility for potential users who plan to be in the Chicago market for the long term,\u201d a Logistics Property spokesperson told the outlet.\nThe company has previously said the facility could support 600 to 800 permanent jobs.

The only holdout is the Cinemark Theater, which is open and untouched by the wrecking crews.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a blank slate for the nearly 70 acres in the center of West Dundee, and we\u2019re excited about what the future may bring for that acreage,\u201d Village Manager Joe Cavallaro told the outlet.\nChicago-based planning firm\nHouseal Lavigne\nis expected to deliver conceptual designs by year\u2019s end to guide redevelopment of the mall property, which opened in 1980 and shuttered in March 2024. Village President\nChris Nelson\nsaid the municipality plans to start marketing the site early next year with an eye toward a mixed-use plan blending housing, retail and entertainment.\nA recent feasibility study suggests the area within the mall\u2019s ring road \u2014 plus 32 adjacent acres \u2014 could support 1,500 residential units and 325,000 square feet of commercial development.\nWest Dundee began acquiring portions of the dead mall in 2023, buying the former Sears and Macy\u2019s stores for $2 million and $1.25 million, respectively. Last year, the village paid another $7 million to purchase the mall\u2019s core, including the old Carson Pirie Scott store, after New York-based\nKohan Retail Investment\nagreed to sell off its remaining stake in the\nmall\n.\n\nOfficials said public ownership was the only way to pave the path for a full-scale redevelopment.\nAbout 20 percent of the property, including the former Carson\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s sites, sits within neighboring\nCarpentersville\n. Earlier this year, Carpentersville agreed to buy the Kohl\u2019s building for $2 million, giving it control over the site\u2019s future. West Dundee will oversee most of the redevelopment, but Carpentersville will retain final approval on its portion.\nDemolition, originally expected to cost $3.8 million and run through November, is finishing ahead of schedule \u2014 a milestone Nelson said \u201csets the table for a complete revamp rather than trying to reuse old buildings that were not necessarily useful in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\nCavallaro added that legal and logistical \u201cspaghetti,\u201d including access covenants, still need to be sorted out before redevelopment can begin.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A sprawling Houston estate modeled after a European castle is back on the market at a\nprice\npoint more familiar to coastal buyers.\nThe 22,000-square-foot home dubbed the Lodge at Hunters Creek, at 107 Timberwilde Lane, relisted for $59.9 million \u2014 or about $2,723 per square foot, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s the most-expensive publicly listed home price in Texas, according to the\nHouston Association of Realtors\n. The 9-acre property overlooking Buffalo Bayou is now represented by Coldwell Banker\u2019s Carol Wolfe, who took it over from the previous agent and raised the price by $10 million from its ask last year.\nThe mansion has appeared on and off the MLS for years, but Wolfe is betting that Houston\u2019s expanding pool of high-net-worth buyers will see value in what she calls a \u201cfortress-level\u201d property with craftsmanship and materials comparable to estates in Beverly Hills or Palm Beach.\n\u201cEstates of this scale and pedigree often command $80 million to $100 million in other markets,\u201d Wolfe told the outlet, adding that Houston\u2019s luxury homes are undervalued by national standards.\nThe property listed in 2022 for\n$60 million\nand increased to\n$65 million\nfor a few months the following year before dropping to\n$49.9 million\n, where it stayed for a year before the listing was removed in November, according to its\nRedfin\nlisting history.\n\nThe estate took six years to construct and was completed in 2005. It includes a 3,500 square-foot guest home as well as staff quarters.\nBuilt by seller Colleen Romanov, the estate channels Richardson Romanesque design with limestone from the same Indiana quarry used for the Empire State Building and the Pentagon. The home blends old-world architecture with discreet modern technology \u2014 such as carved mahogany woodwork, hidden doors and a two-story library accented by iron detailing, situated alongside concealed televisions and sound systems.\nThe estate has manicured gardens, a pool house and a guesthouse designed in Texas Hill Country style, all tucked behind gates in the affluent Memorial Villages enclave.\nWolfe compared the listing to the most-expensive house ever sold in Houston, at 120 Carnarvon, a 27,000-square-foot mansion that sold for more than $21 million in\n2022\n, or about $778 per square foot. The Romanov estate is asking almost triple that, and a sale anywhere near that would turn heads in the national ultra-luxury market.\nSales of homes priced above $10 million in Houston surged 75 percent year-over-year in 2023, according to Compass, and the number of millionaires living in the city has jumped 75 percent in the past decade, to roughly 82,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a long year for the Brooklyn Mirage.\nThe East Williamsburg live music venue may be starting down a new path after the building\u2019s owner has filed for a demolition permit for at least some of the venue, part of a bigger space called Avant Gardner.\nA demolition would cap a tumultuous series of months \u2014 ones that included canceled shows, bankruptcy filings and overrun renovation costs.\nThe application is for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet. The overall complex is roughly 80,000 square feet and estimated cost is $1.5 million, according to the permit application. Avant Gardner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTroubles for the Brooklyn Mirage and Avant Gardner started in 2023, after two separate incidents of patrons being found dead after attending the venue. (The venue said the deaths were tragic but denied responsibility.)\nBut the party kept going until earlier this year, when the venue closed for a slate of renovations. The company set a May 1 opening date and booked a summer full of shows.\nInstead the venue was silent. The venue failed to meet its inspection deadline and the buildings department yanked its temporary occupancy certificate, Brooklyn Paper\nreported\n.\n\nAlthough the Mirage applied for the permit every year, the buildings department told Brooklyn Paper the latest edition of the venue not only didn\u2019t meet permitting guidelines, it was flat out unsafe.\n\u201cDOB had numerous objections to the performance space, both safety related and technical in nature, that prevented the project from being code-compliant and safe enough to open for the public,\u201d a DOB spokesperson told Brooklyn Paper. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a question of red tape, but rather a list of legitimate issues with the constructed space.\u201d\nAvant Gardner fired its CEO and replaced him with Gary Richards, who is also known by his DJ alias Destructo. Adding to the drama,\nBKMag\npublished the eyewitness account of an eavesdropper who overheard Richards telling his dinner companion at French restaurant Per Se that the company was struggling to find a buyer.\nAvant Gardner\u2019s parent company filed for bankruptcy in early August. It reported\n$153.3 million in funded debt obligations\n, according to Bloomberg.\nRichards blamed the financial troubles on the loss of the Mirage and aggressive lenders, with some advancing the company $20 million to stay afloat, according to Bloomberg. The company said it was working with the buildings department on a remediation plan.\nMost recently, Avant Gardner has proposed a settlement with creditors, Law360\nreported\n. An affiliate of the company\u2019s lender is slated to purchase the venue\u2019s assets after no other qualified bids were received, according to bankruptcy documents.\nA hearing to approve the sale is scheduled for Oct. 22.\n",

The financing mechanism, which bundles loans together and sells them to investors, usually offers the cheapest source of financing.\nDemand for CMBS financing fell off in 2008 when the property markets crashed during the Financial Crisis. But the market rebounded in the following years thanks to a renewed interest in commercial real estate.\nCMBS issuance fell to just $55 billion in 2020\n, only for it to nearly double the following year to $109 billion.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve started to increase rates in 2022, spreads on CMBS loans jumped and issuance declined. But spreads, or the perceived risk of CMBS loans, recently decreased to around 80 basis points as the Federal Reserve moved to cut the Federal Funds rate a quarter of a percentage point.\nCMBS office deals are for sure becoming more palatable to investors.\nBut most of the new issuance is concentrated in single-asset, single-borrower loans, instead of conduit loans, according to Trepp. This shows that investors are being highly selective and not taking bets on the asset class, but rather on a single office building.\nMuch has been made about the\nresurgence of the city\u2019s office market\nand institutional investors\u2019 return to the asset class. But a closer look shows investment is mostly concentrated in hyper-local\nsubmarkets such as Grand Central\n.\nCMBS is exhibiting a similar trend. Investment is increasing, but only in select parts of the market.\nAt the same time, distress is continuing to play out, and CMBS delinquency rates remain at record levels. In August, CMBS office loans had a remarkable 11.66 percent delinquency rate before notching 11.13 percent in September, according to Trepp, which tracks securitized mortgages.\n",

The firms have previously partnered on several projects, including two\nGowanus developments\nand a $370 million mixed-use multi-family project\nin Long Island City.\nThe firms declined to disclose the acquisition price.\nDomain co-founders and co-CEOs Matt Schwartz and Chris Papamichael will continue to lead the company. Vorea\u2019s founder, Peter Papamichael \u2014 cousin to Domain\u2019s Papamichael \u2014 will join as executive managing director, overseeing development acquisitions and business development, the firm announced.\nDomain will acquire Vorea\u2019s development arm, its commercial brokerage, and its general contracting business. Vorea\u2019s existing assets are not included in the deal and will become part of Peter Papamichael\u2019s family office.\n\nThe move comes as construction and financing costs continue to pressure margins citywide. By pulling Vorea\u2019s construction and leasing teams in-house, Domain will control more of its supply chain, a strategy that\u2019s become increasingly common among New York developers trying to keep projects on budget and on schedule.\nVorea, founded in 2009, developed mixed-use and residential projects in the outer boroughs while expanding into general contracting and commercial leasing, expertise Domain will use to help scale its growing New York City pipeline.\nThat pipeline includes roughly $2 billion in upcoming projects, such as the next phase of Greenpoint Landing, a 1,000-unit development set to break ground in 2026. The firm is also planning a 400-unit residential project across two towers in Astoria,\nCrain\u2019s reported\n.\nMeanwhile, Domain has major holdings in New Orleans and Salt Lake City, where it\u2019s expanded into hospitality, office and life sciences.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that landlords have not been happy about\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rent\nin nearly half of New York City apartments.\nBut with the election just weeks away and a Mamdani mayoralty looking more likely than ever, some rent-stabilized players have shifted their focus. If a rent freeze is a near certainty, they ask, what else can be done to mitigate\ngrowing distress in rent-stabilized portfolios\n? Policies that tamp down on landlords\u2019 expenses have the potential to ease distress and also win support from a tenant-focused administration.\n\u201cWith Mamdani, it\u2019s not in his political interests for buildings to fall apart,\u201d said Ben Carlos Thypin, CEO of the real estate brokerage Quantierra. \u201cThe dynamics are such that the likelihood of change seems higher than it was before.\u201d\nRafael Cestero, CEO at Community Preservation Corp, said he has been watching distress grow in even the most conservative portfolios. The nonprofit lender has seen foreclosures in rent-stabilized buildings with little debt and fixed-rate mortgages\nincrease eightfold\nin the past two years.\nMuch of that is due to eye-popping expense increases, such as a\n52 percent increase in insurance costs over five years\n.\nPolicies to address that side of the equation could help, according to Cestero. A public property insurance option, such as what the federal government offers homeowners in flood-prone areas, could bring down prices. An as-of-right tax abatement for rent-stabilized buildings could also help property owners who pay city taxes.\nPolicies like that could make a significant impact on curbing distress in rent-stabilized buildings, an issue some policy experts fear could slowly make buildings uninhabitable due to deferred maintenance.\n\u201cPolitics and campaigns are done in poetry. And then governance is done in prose,\u201d Cestero said. \u201cThe assemblymember, should he be the mayor, has shown over the last few weeks that he understands that governance is different from campaigning.\u201d\nMamdani has begun talking about some of those policy adjustments. He\ntold the audience\nat Crain\u2019s mayoral forum this month that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d\nsupports comprehensive property tax reform\n. And a rent freeze does not preclude policies to lower insurance or energy costs, he said.\n\u201cThe impetus here is to provide relief to a disproportionately working- and middle-class set of New Yorkers,\u201d said Mamdani. \u201cIt is not, however, to punish the landlords of those units.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for rent-stabilized landlords have taken note of Mamdani\u2019s change in tone.\n\u201cCertainly conversations seem to have shifted,\u201d said Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association. \u201cTime will tell what the results of this will be, but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d\nTo be sure, those policies are likely expensive. Property tax reform would be a major political lift, and one that former mayors have failed to execute on. And policies often need to be carefully designed. Some of the city\u2019s other attempts to help out rent-stabilized property owners have made no impact. For example, a program to reimburse landlords for renovations of vacant units has gone completely unused, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nEven with these expense-side tweaks, costs could still overtake revenue, Cestero said. A politically viable solution on the revenue side, he said, may be to peg allowable rent increases to inflation and other indexes, as California does.\nBut a focus on compromise could win Mamdani some tacit support in the real estate industry.\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely a solution there that makes everybody happy,\u201d said Peter Hungerford, an investor in rent-stabilized properties. \u201cIf Mamdani can deliver on that, he\u2019s going to earn my vote for re-election.\u201d\nHungerford and his business partners are making a bet that they can buy rent-stabilized buildings at fire sale prices and hold onto them until a change in circumstances raises their value. Other rent-stabilized investors, typically low-profile New York landlords, are making that same wager.\nFor those investors, a rent freeze may not make a real difference to their bottom line, but they still welcome help on the expense side.\n\u201cIf things get worse in the meantime, because there is no compromise, that scenario doesn\u2019t scare us as investors,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cBut it absolutely scares me as a New Yorker.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In the final months of the Adams administration, these rezonings are heading to the finish line.\nThe rezoning of some 230 blocks in Jamaica, Queens, is slated for a final City Council vote this month. Last week, the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises and the Committee on Land Use approved the rezoning with a few changes.\nThose changes shaved 490 units off the city\u2019s housing projections for the rezoning. Instead of 12,300 units, the rezoning is expected to pave the way for roughly 11,800 units.\nThe modifications included reducing the density allowed in areas south of downtown Jamaica, as well as removing \u201climited portions\u201d of certain districts along the southern corridor from the rezoning.\nThe changes, explained Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the zoning subcommittee, are aimed at creating a transition from the higher densities downtown to the residential areas to the south, \u201cwhere there are blocks of occupied homes and less access to transit.\u201d\nThe Adams administration also committed to providing $413 million for infrastructure, parks, schools and other improvements. That\u2019s in addition to more than $300 million promised as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity.\nThe City Council is also expected to vote this month on the rezoning of 50-plus blocks in Long Island City, though local Council member Julie Won hasn\u2019t publicly committed to supporting the rezoning, calling for deeper affordability and investments for infrastructure improvements.\nThose rezonings, assuming they are approved, will close out five neighborhood rezonings completed by the Adams administration. Meanwhile, some other major initiatives, such as a text amendment that would require special permits for most last-mile facilities and the Manhattan Plan, will be left to the next mayor (should the next mayor choose to pick them up).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nReporters got a somewhat unusual email today: James Felton Keith, who is planning to challenge Rep. Adriano Espaillat for his seat in New York\u2019s 13th district, says he met with developer Bruce Teitelbaum, who committed to building a 100 percent affordable building as part of One45 in Harlem. This isn\u2019t new: Teitelbaum already agreed to increase the amount of affordable housing in the project if the city and/or state provide additional subsidies. Keith is calling on the mayoral candidates to commit to financing this affordable housing. Will the next mayor provide funding for One45? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: \u201cChi Oss\u00e9 and the People\u2019s Fight to End Forced Broker Fees,\u201d a short documentary by ABC Localish\u2019s Cameron Covell, won a New York Emmy this weekend. The video details the passage of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act last year, from Oss\u00e9\u2019s perspective.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nIf contract negotiations stall, Broadway musicians are prepared to strike,\nGothamist reports\n. The union that represents the musicians, Local 802 AFM, authorized a strike on Sunday night, meaning that a strike could take place if the union and Broadway League are unable to reach an agreement. Musicians are seeking higher wages, better health care coverage and layoff protections, according to Gothamist. Meanwhile, Broadway actors and stage managers have also threatened to strike if they cannot agree on terms for a new contract with the Broadway League.\n\u2014\nA 76-year-old woman was killed in Brooklyn on Sunday by an airborne solar panel on Monday in Brooklyn\n,\nCBS News reports\n. Video of the incident shows strong winds carrying a solar panel from a parking lot structure and falling onto the woman\u2019s head.\n\u2014\u00a0The state Assembly this month will hold a hearing to examine why more upstate localities haven\u2019t adopted rent stabilization. \u201cI want to gauge how strong it is, and whether there are things that would make it easier for localities to accept,\u201d Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who chairs the Housing Committee,\ntold the Times Union\n.\nClosing Time\nDue to the holiday on Monday, no closings were recorded. Check back Tuesday for information on the latest deals.",

The mandate comes after\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nsigned Assembly Bill 628 into law last week.\nThe legislation goes beyond apartments and affects single family rentals as well, if they\u2019re owned by corporations, real estate investment trusts or limited liability companies.\nAssemblymember Tina McKinnor\n, whose district spans from Venice to Hawthorne, authored the bill. McKinnor created the legislation after realizing that refrigerators and stoves were legally labeled as amenities.\nThe average rent in Los Angeles is nearly $2,800 a month, nearly $700 higher than the national average, according to Zillow. San Francisco has some of the highest residential rents in the country, averaging almost $3,700 a month.\n\nA 2022 Los Angeles Times investigation\nfound\nthat California had more apartments without refrigerators on the market than any other state. Landlords were only required to maintain some \u201cstandard characteristics\u201d for a residential unit, including hot and cold running water, heat and weather proofing. McKinnor advocated to include a fridge and stove as similar necessities for a rental unit to be considered habitable.\n\u201cA working stove and a working refrigerator are not luxuries. They are a necessary part of modern life,\u201d McKinnor\nsaid\nin a statement prior to\nNewsom\u2019s signature\n. \u201cBy making these necessary appliances standard in rental homes, California can provide all of its residents with a safer, more affordable and more dignified place to call home.\u201d\nLandlords looking to skip out on providing these appliances only have another two and a half months to do so. The law requiring them to provide a stove capable of generating heat for cooking and a refrigerator capable of safely storing food for new leases goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The community, southeast of Morris Dido Newark and Bonds Ranch roads near Eagle Mountain Lake, is slated for nearly 1,800 homes, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nPMB Capital secured city approvals in 2022 for a 1,900-home plan, but Centurion has since adjusted the layout to 1,761 single-family homes built across four phases.\nIBC Bank is providing financing for the development, which will feature homes from Coventry Homes, D.R. Horton, First Texas Homes and HistoryMaker Homes on lots between 50- to 80-foot lots.\nConstruction on the first phase is expected to begin in early 2027. Fort Worth\u2019s explosive population growth is driving suburban housing demand, Moayedi said.\n\nThe deal deepened Centurion\u2019s bet on the north Fort Worth market.\nThe company is planning\nAlpha Ranch\n, a 1,825-acre community along Sendera Ranch Boulevard north of Fort Worth that could eventually include 4,000 homes. Rio Claro also sits near the Estates at Eagle Mountain, an 836-acre, 1,126-lot subdivision in the works by other builders, adding to the surge of residential activity around the lake.\nAs rooftops rise, infrastructure is trying to keep pace. Fort Worth officials are weighing a $200 million plan to widen\nBonds Ranch Road\n, add streetlights and upgrade intersections to ease congestion tied to the area\u2019s rapid build-out. The corridor has become a magnet for national homebuilders, including Lennar and D.R. Horton, both of which already have multiple projects nearby.\nCenturion American has developed more than 200,000 home lots across North Texas since 1990, including Collin County\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLegacy Hills\nand the billion-dollar overhaul of the former\nCollin Creek Mall\nin Plano.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $47.6 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 263 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 19 contracts totaling $71.5 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe team\u2019s report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 49 new listings, and a total of 1,065 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that found buyers last week, nine were single-family homes and one was a\u00a0 condo. The condo that went pending is asking $6.5 million, or $2,311 per square foot, and spent\u00a0 541 days on the market.\n\nThe single-family homes total $41.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 91 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $4.6 million.\nThe top listing to find a buyer last week was the 7,600-square-foot house at 17153 Ericarose Court in Boca Raton asking $9.5 million. Records show the owner is David Kreiss, the president of Palm Beach Gardens-based KM2 Solutions, a firm that specializes in outsourcing customer relationship management services. He bought the home, which is in the gated St. Andrews Country Club community, for $4.7 million in 2020, according to property records. It was built in 1988 on 0.9 acres and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a pool, records show.\nKreiss listed it in September, Zillow shows. Jeannine Patricia Morris and Blake Benjamin Morris with Lang Realty have the listing.\nThe second-most expensive home to go pending was unit A2 at One Royal Palm Way at 100 Royal Palm Way in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $6.5 million. Records show the seller is the trust of the late Elizabeth Bowden, who bought the unit with her late husband Charles W. Bowden Jr. for $600,000 in 1994. He was a real estate developer in the Philadelphia area, according to his obituary. The unit spans 2,810 square feet, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, records show.\nIt hit the market for $9.3 million in 2023, Zillow shows. Dana and Paulette Koch with the Corcoran Group have the listing.\n",

        "content": "A city north of the Illinois border \u2014 popular with Chicagoland commuters \u2014 was one of the hottest real estate markets in the country in September, according to a ranking that showed strong activity in affordable Midwest markets.\nKenosha, Wisconsin, was the third-hottest real estate market nationally last month. The city, about 60 miles north of Chicago, was joined by six other Wisconsin markets and two in Illinois in the top 20, ranked by days on the market and activity on Realtor.com\u2019s listing page.\nKenosha properties received about 2.7 times more views per property than the U.S. average in September. Kenosha houses spent about 34 days on the market last month, compared to the national median of 62 days.\nThe rankings reveal buyers are increasingly interested in low-cost markets outside major hubs like Chicago, where prices are rising and\nlow inventory is squeezing availability\n.\nKenosha is a popular destination for\npeople moving out of the Chicago area\n, said Ben Gentile, a broker with Epique Realty who works in Kenosha and nearby communities. As the Chicago\nsuburbs have gone up in price\nand\nproperty taxes keep rising\n, Gentile said he\u2019s seen a growing number of buyers leaving the area for southeast Wisconsin.\n\u201cPeople from Cook County are moving into the suburbs for affordability, safety, things like that,\u201d Gentile said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s pushing people out of the suburbs to relocate out to these other areas that are less expensive.\u201d\n\nKenosha\u2019s placement on Interstate 94, between Chicago and Milwaukee, makes it a common place for commuters to the larger cities, Gentile said. He said a sizable chunk of new Kenosha residents are commuters who work in the Chicago area, often in the suburbs.\nOne reason for Kenosha\u2019s red-hot market is a persistent low inventory, Gentile said, as construction has not kept up with demand. Sellers can command high prices for their listings, and there\u2019s a large pool of buyers eager to snatch up available houses. That influx of interest can make buying difficult for locals, especially first-time buyers, Gentile said.\nThe median home sale price in Kenosha increased from $185,000 in August 2020 to $296,000 in August of this year, according to Redfin. Prices this August were up 22 percent year-over-year from last August.\nA similar picture is playing out elsewhere in Wisconsin: Appleton and Wassau tied for fifth place in Realtor.com\u2019s hotness rankings, while Racine, just north of Kenosha, came in seventh. The Janesville and Green Bay markets ranked ninth and 10th, while the Milwaukee metro ranked 19th. Properties in those Wisconsin markets were viewed at least twice as much as the national average and spent fewer than 40 days on the market.\nIn Illinois, two markets cracked the list: Rockford came in eighth, with 2.9 times more views per property than the national average. The average Rockford house was listed at $250,000 and spent 38 days on the market. Springfield, where the average listing price was $204,000, ranked 12th. Houses there were viewed 2.4 times more than the national average and spent 34 days on the market.\nSeveral apartment and residential projects are underway in the Kenosha area, according to local reporting. But with the long timeline and high cost of construction, it\u2019s likely Kenosha will stay hot and remain a seller\u2019s market for at least the next few years.\n",

        "content": "In a case that typifies landlords\u2019 exasperation with New York City\u2019s dysfunctional eviction process, on Oct. 9, Tasheem Jenkins was finally ousted from Apartment D of 367 Wadsworth Avenue, where he had\nlived rent-free\nfor two years.\nThe Washington Heights case was remarkable in that Jenkins, with some help from the Adams administration but without a lawyer, staved off eviction for so long.\nYet at the same time it was unremarkable: It echoed the experiences of landlords and their lawyers in the post-pandemic era, during which housing court\u2019s pace has slowed from that of a sloth to that of an oak tree.\nThe last three months were a microcosm of the entire case against Jenkins and the fashion model Aubrey Hill, with whom Jenkins had shared the rent-stabilized apartment before taking it over.\nThe landlord had not been aware of their sublet agreement. But in New York City, once people are inside a unit, even if they have no lease and do not pay rent, it can be exceedingly difficult to get them out.\nIn mid July, Justice Adam Meyers ruled that Jenkins had exhausted his legal arguments, noting that the landlord \u201cwas awarded judgment of possession against Jenkins almost a year ago, and its ability to realize this relief cannot be delayed indefinitely.\u201d\nStill, the judge paused the eviction through Aug. 29 to give Jenkins six more rent-free weeks \u201cto vacate the premises with dignity.\u201d\nBut Jenkins did not vacate. Just before he was to leave, he filed a motion with the court, as he had done repeatedly each time his eviction date neared. The judge, despite his earlier decision, pushed back the date yet again, to Oct. 7.\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, Jenkins filed another order to show cause on Oct. 6. This time, he didn\u2019t contest the eviction but asked the court to postpone it once more, \u201cpossibly a few more days while I am trying to move out.\u201d He said he was looking for movers and added, \u201cI have an update from HRA/APS.\u201d\n\nJenkins was referring to the Human Resources Administration, and a division of it called Adult Protective Services. According to its\nwebsite\n, APS \u201cprovides services for physically and/or mentally impaired adults\u201d and \u201cworks to help at-risk clients live safely in their homes.\u201d\nBut Meyers had ruled over the summer that Jenkins was not impaired, based in part on his able representation of himself in housing court since the fall of 2023. APS had reached a similar conclusion in February.\nThe judge denied Jenkins\u2019 last-ditch request, writing by hand that he \u201chas been afforded ample time to complete his move.\u201d\nJenkins, as he had signaled, then turned back to APS, a card he\u2019d\nplayed twice before\n. The unit, like its parent agency, has gotten into the business of delaying evictions and thus the city\u2019s obligation to provide shelter.\nAPS then apparently persuaded the Department of Investigation \u2014 which oversees city marshals, who carry out evictions \u2014 to stop the clock on Jenkins\u2019 removal. How DOI can trump a housing court judge is unclear, but this was not the first time.\nThis spring, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported, the agency forbade a marshal from enforcing a co-op\u2019s eviction order against an elderly woman named Emma Oliver, who was squatting in a building from which she had\nembezzled $122,680\nand then stopped paying maintenance for six years.\nBut Jenkins\u2019 third go-round with APS bought him less time than the first two. After a two-day stay, DOI cleared the eviction with APS and allowed the marshal to execute it.\nJenkins will never have to pay the landlord a dime, in all likelihood, because he never had a lease for the $1,675-a-month apartment. The leaseholder was his family friend Hill, the first high fashion model from West Virginia, so the arrears \u2014 which exceed $60,000 \u2014 are technically her responsibility.\nIt is uncertain if the landlord will seek a judgment against Hill or, if he gets one, whether he could even collect on it: After agreeing to a settlement for her back rent in late 2023, Hill neglected to pay and instead\nmoved to Europe\n. Interest and arrears have been accruing ever since.\n",

        "content": "Housing Trust Group won approval from the city of Hollywood for Hillcrest Village, an all-affordable, eight-story apartment development with 110 units in the city\u2019s Hillcrest area.\nThe Hollywood City Commission voted unanimously last week to rezone the Hillcrest Village development site, approve the proposed site plan, and modify a master plan for the planned development of\nthe city\u2019s Hillcrest area\njust west of I-95 along Pembroke Road.\nThe market for rent-restricted apartments at Hillcrest Village probably will include current residents of the Hillcrest area, Hollywood Vice Mayor Idelma Quintana said at the city commission meeting.\n\u201cOne of the reasons that I gave for supporting this project was the understanding that there are many current Hillcrest residents who are having trouble meeting their own housing costs and are concerned about being able to stay in the community,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cSome of the folks there are afraid of losing their condos.\u201d\nHTG plans to reserve the one- and two-bedroom apartments for renters who earn 30 percent to 80 percent of area median income. That equates to a range of $28,860 to $76,960, based on data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that shows that Broward County\u2019s median household income is $96,200.\n\nThe longtime owner of the 2.5-acre development site at 1101 Hillcrest Drive is Hollywood-based\nTobin\n, a family owned real estate business led by Chairman and CEO Herbert A. Tobin and President and COO Jason L. Tobin.\nTobin jointly applied for city approvals for the\naffordable housing\ndevelopment with Miami-based Housing Trust Group, led by President and CEO Matthew Rieger and Executive Chairman and founder Randy Rieger.\nThe mixed-income apartment building would have a specific number of units for renters based on their income. The majority, 52 units, would be reserved for renters with up to 60 percent of area median income. Another 31 units would be for renters with up to 70 percent of AMI. Renters with up to 30 percent of AMI would occupy 17 of the units, and those with up to 80 percent would occupy 10 of the units.\nAmenities planned for Hillcrest Village include a pool, gym, clubhouse and caf\u00e9, along with Amazon parcel lockers, a playground and a rooftop community garden. The mixed-use development also is designed with 744 square feet of office space.\nIn approving the site plan for Hillcrest Village, city commissioners also selected one of two possible architectural designs for the development. The commissioners chose the original design at their meeting last week, after\nHousing Trust Group\npresented an alternative design to them.\nIn August, the Hollywood Planning and Development Board recommended approval of HTG\u2019s proposed site plan, on the condition that the developer prepare and present an alternative design for the Hollywood City Commission\u2019s review.",

        "content": "It was the personal touch that won over Jay Luchs when Antonio Villaraigosa \u2014 a Democrat making his second run for California governor \u2014 called to talk about real estate.\n\u201cI respect him for picking up the phone and calling me to talk business personally and it made me interested in supporting him,\u201d Luchs, executive vice chairman at Newmark in Los Angeles, said via email.\nPlus there\u2019s the former Los Angeles mayor\u2019s stance on\nMeasure ULA\n, a property tax which is criticized by developers in California for increasing the cost of and slowing the pace of development, despite being intended to fund housing solutions.\n\u201cHe seems to get [that Measure] ULA not working and is sensitive to it,\u201d Luchs said. \u201cIt took the life out of residential and commercial property sales. It\u2019s nice to have someone get that.\u201d\nLuchs donated a total of $10,175.25 for Villaraigosa\u2019s 2026 campaign, according to\nan\nanalysis of contributions to 2026 gubernatorial candidates via\nCalifornia Secretary of State records\nby\nThe Real Deal\n.\nVillaraigosa, 72, leads on fundraising from donors among a crowded field\nof contenders in the governor\u2019s race, which is slated for a primary election in June, with the top two finishers squaring off in the general election in November 2026. He has garnered $4.5 million via 787 contributions.\nThe top fundraiser overall, so far, is Stephen Cloobeck, a Democrat and former CEO of timeshare company Diamond Resorts. Cloobeck, who has raked in $13.6 million on 172 contributions. Cloobeck\u2019s own $13 million in donations\u00a0 to himself put him at the top of the fundraising list at this point, but he also got some contributions from real estate executives, including $72,800 from\nWilliam Meldman, chairman of\nDiscover Land Company\n, a Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered real estate developer and operator of private residential communities and resorts, and another $20,500 from five of his employees. Cloobeck also received $51,400 from family-owned real estate investment firm Randall Realty Group, led by\nJames Randall\n, the airplane rivet king-turned-philanthropist, and $36,400 from Jim Murren, former CEO of MGM Resorts International.\nVillaraigosa served as the mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013, the first Latino to hold the post since 1872. He started in elected office in the state Assembly, and served as Speaker from 1998 to 2000, lost a run for mayor in 2001, and served two years in the Los Angeles City Council before winning the mayor\u2019s race in 2005. Villaraigosa ran for governor\nin 2018\n, losing to eventual winner Gavin Newsom in the primary, failing to make the runoff.\nNo L.A. mayor has ever made it to the governor\u2019s office, according to\nCalMatters\n. But that hasn\u2019t stopped other high-profile real estate players like\nWestside Estate Agency\n\u2019s\nKurt Rappaport\n, developer\nJoseph Moinian\nand Related California\u2019s\nBill Witte\nfrom supporting Villaraigosa.\nRappaport, a top broker and co-founder and CEO of Westside Estate Agency, has shelled out $72,800 (the maximum contribution per candidate in an election cycle, including $39,200 for the primary and $39,200 for the general election). Moinian, a New York City-based developer with Los Angeles properties in its portfolio, and Witte, chairman and CEO of Related California, dropped $5,000 apiece.\nAlagem Capital Group\u2019s Beny Alagem, a\nminority partner\nin One Beverly Hills, and owner of the Beverly Hilton and the adjacent Waldorf-Astoria, donated $35,000.\nBeyond real estate, Villaraigosa received donations from bigwigs in the entertainment industry, including \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d host Ryan Seacrest ($72,800), film director Rob Reiner ($7,500), and Jon Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate film studio ($5,000). (In his first run, Villaraigosa appeared at an event hosted by Seacrest.)\nIn addition, Villaraigosa received $72,800 from one of the biggest landowners in the state, Stewart Resnick, chairman of Wonderful Company with food and beverage brands including Wonderful Pistachios &amp; Almonds, POM Wonderful and FIJI Water. The candidate also got $5,000 from Dominic Ng, chairman and CEO of East West Bank, a major commercial real estate lender.\nL.A. Mayor\nKaren Bass\n, who endorsed her longtime ally, contributed $1,046 to his campaign.\nThe playing field\n\nDeveloper Rick Caruso, a Democrat since 2022,\nmay or may not\nrun for governor and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla is\nmulling\nentry to the race, but there are a slew of candidates who have declared their intention to replace incumbent Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited out.\nOne is Katie Porter, who served as a U.S. representative from California from 2019 to 2025. The Democrat, who has come under fire for her conduct in several recently released videos, brought in just under $3 million in 13,794 contributions. Her donors include Richard K. Robbins, owner of construction company Wareham Property Group ($39,200); Thumbrack CEO Marco Zappacosta ($20,000); and Joseph Kampfer, chairman of McArthurGlen Group, developer and manager of designer outlet malls ($5,000).\nBritish native, former conservative political adviser and former Fox News host Steve Hilton garnered $1.88 million via 1,306 contributions, all in small sums. The Republican received $500 donations from real estate professionals such as Andrew Mortaza, director of the luxury estates division at The Agency, Sotheby\u2019s agent Jeffrey Earl Warren and Papadopoulos Properties\u2019 Thomas Papadopoulos.\nChad Bianco, the Republican sheriff of Riverside County, California, collected $1.87 million in 3,256 contributions. Those came from retail developer Alexander Haagen III, chairman and CEO of Haagen Company ($39,200), and Highland Fairview, a full-service real estate development company ($39,200).\nFormer state controller Betty Yee, a Democrat, notched $1.6 million through 4,588 contributions for her gubernatorial run, including $5,000 from Dara Smith, deputy assessor for the Los Angeles county assessor\u2019s office, the nation\u2019s largest property assessment agency.\nDemocrat Tony Thurmond, the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and a former social worker, claims $1.4 million in support through 1,421 contributions. Among his donors are\u00a0 Gerry Kamilos\u2019 Kamilos Companies ($36,400); Moses Libitzky of Emeryville, California-based Libitzky Property Companies ($39,200); and John Sobrato, co-owner of the NFL\u2019s San Francisco 49ers and chairman of the Sobrato Organization real estate organization ($20,000). Robbins, who contributed to Porter, gave $15,000 to Thurmond.\nIndependent candidate\nEthan Penner\n, the\npioneer of commercial mortgage-backed securities\n, received $552,506.02 in 50 contributions, with more than $100,000 coming from\nhimself\n. He received backing from James \u201cWatty\u201d Watson, managing partner of commercial real estate CT Realty Investors. The executive, based in Dallas, coughed up $39,200.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Ethan for over 30 years, which feels like a lifetime,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, solution-minded, a financial rockstar, exceptional business builder/value creator and has a huge heart.\u201d\nAmong other things, Watson said via email: \u201cHe is passionate about California and is particularly focused on repairing the tragic condition of California for his children. As a proven financial genius and fair-minded and practical business manager, it\u2019s possible he can prevent this great state from hitting the wall.\u201d\nWatson\u2019s colleague, Carter Ewing, managing partner at CT Realty based in Newport Beach, contributed $25,000.\n\u201cEthan has some very creative ideas for righting the ship,\u201d Ewing shared over email, \u201cfrom eliminating state income tax to establishing investment savings accounts for California\u2019s youth. He has some unique ideas for balancing our budget and ensuring California\u2019s residents are vested in the fiscal success of our state.\u201d\nIn addition to Penner\u2019s financial background, Ewing said, \u201cEthan\u2019s family reflects California\u2019s diversity, with his wife Marisol (an immigrant from Venezuela) and their five children, including two adopted sons from Ethiopia and Venezuela.\u201d\nChad Carpenter, founder and CEO of La Jolla-based real estate investment management firm Reven Capital, shelled out $2,868.52 for Penner\u2019s campaign.\nBrian Lavin, executive chairman of NTS Capital who handles the firm\u2019s real estate development and land acquisitions, paid out $10,000.\nCandidates that have recently raised less than $500,000 or had no funds listed include Republican Leo Zacky, a business executive and entrepreneur and former candidate for governor; former Assemblymember Ian Calderon, a Democrat; and former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration. But Becerra has more than $1 million for his campaign thanks mostly to a transfer of money from a previous congressional campaign.\n",

        "content": "The trade of a\ngrocery-anchored shopping center\n\u2014 home to an outpost of\ngrocer H-E-B\n\u2014 marks the largest retail transaction in Alamo City since 2021.\nA joint venture of MCB Real Estate, Epic Real Estate Partners and Centerbridge Partners purchased the 440,000-square-foot Northwoods Shopping Center, according to a release from MCB, which is based in Baltimore. Epic is based in Austin, and Centerbridge is in New York.\nTruist Bank provided the acquisition loan.\nNorthwoods, at 18140 San Pedro Drive, is at the intersection of Highway 281 and Loop 1604. The spot has a daytime population of 114,000 people within a 3 mile radius.\nBarshop &amp; Oles Company developed the property in 1996. In addition to H-E-B, the center is home to Nordstrom Rack, Marshall\u2019s, Ulta and\nBarnes &amp; Noble, which is having a renaissance\nafter years of being dominated by Amazon. The shopping center is 91 percent leased.\n\nMCB has been on a retail tear in the last two years, picking up Falcon Ridge Shopping Center in Fontana, California, and Takoma Park Shopping Center near Washington, D.C. The firm also acquired a former Century 21 store in Brooklyn with plans to spend $100 million redeveloping the property.\nRetail has proven to be a wise real estate investment after warnings about the death knell of retail after the Great Financial Crisis kept developers from building new products. As a result, space is limited and rents are high.\nRetail rents are up from a year ago in San Antonio, increasing from $19.47 to $19.82 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are low, hovering between 3.9 and 4 percent over the last 12 months.\nThe lack of inventory means the market has been able to weather headwinds like the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\nand Forever 21.\nExperiential users like gyms\nare gobbling up that space.\n",

        "content": "New York elected officials think they can use regulation to bend the laws of economics. And sometimes they can. Rent stabilization, for example, uses price controls to keep rents\nartificially low\non 1 million apartments.\nUsually, however, the government must heap regulation upon regulation and build a\nrobust enforcement infrastructure\nto defy natural market forces \u2014 and even then, there will be\ncheating\n. The marijuana industry is discovering this now.\nWhen New York lawmakers legalized weed, they didn\u2019t just revoke criminal statutes. They insisted that all weed sold in New York also be grown in New York.\nBut weed grown elsewhere is cheaper. California, for example, has more farmland, more sun, and a mature industry. Economies of scale makes West Coast cannabis less costly than New York\u2019s, even with the transportation expense and the illegality of shipping it here.\nAs a result, between 50 percent and 80 percent of weed sold by licensed retailers in New York is not grown here, contrary to the law, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Market forces are strong, and cannabis enforcement is too weak to overcome the Pollyannish ideal imagined by New York legislators: an entirely in-state, seed-to-sale system.\nThe big takeaway is that as supply has flooded in from beyond our borders, the price of cannabis biomass has fallen by 45 percent.\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice (for tenants, homebuyers and employers) if New York could reduce rents and home prices by 45 percent?\nOf course, we cannot simply import dwellings (except for modular homes, but we cannot import land to put them on). We could, however, boost housing supply by reforming\nproperty taxes\n, zoning, rent stabilization, the \u201c\nscaffold law\n\u201d and other regulatory schemes.\nJust to take one of a thousand examples, think about the process for replacing a small, decrepit apartment building with a larger, modern, energy-efficient one.\n\nBecause of\ntenant protections\n, it takes years and sometimes decades to empty a building. For all that time, units sit empty while the owner waits for a few remaining tenants to move, die or accept a buyout.\nPerhaps that helps tenants in that one building, but it doesn\u2019t help tenants overall to keep units empty in the teeth of a housing shortage. The bigger issue is that the process is so costly and onerous that most undersized, aging buildings remain in place year after year.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of how lawmakers have made housing more expensive in an effort to make it cheaper.\nAt the very least, the state should let developers replace small apartment buildings with large ones if they keep the same number of rent-stabilized units, house tenants during construction and give them the right to return.\nBut the biggest supply boost would come from putting the interests of all tenants over those in a particular building.\nLegislators should think about the housing crisis as they try to fix the marijuana cheating problem that they created.\nThe economic lesson is simple: Weed sellers (and some farmers) are bringing down the cost of cannabis by buying it from states that have a surplus.\nHousing would be cheaper, too, not to mention nicer, safer and more energy-efficient, if we allowed developers to create a surplus. And it\u2019s a lot better for you than weed.\n",

Years later, Zekaria pleaded guilty to stealing nearly $400,000 from other clients and was disbarred, but Brown has yet to recover her funds.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office has largely ignored her repeated complaints, Brown said, even as prosecutors in Suffolk County confirmed the money had vanished from Zekaria\u2019s accounts by 2020.\nThe inaction has blocked other avenues for restitution. The state-run Lawyer\u2019s Fund for Client Protection, which reimburses victims of attorney theft, denied Brown\u2019s claim this year, partly because Bragg\u2019s office never investigated.\nThe Fund has reimbursed just two of Zekaria\u2019s former clients to date, despite reports from a court-appointed receiver that roughly 30 people may have been affected.\n\n\u201cThe silence from the Manhattan DA continues to be deafening,\u201d the receiver wrote to Brown last year.\nBragg\u2019s office said it would \u201cre-review\u201d the complaint and contact the Fund after questioning from the publication. A spokesperson said the DA takes \u201cfinancial fraud in Manhattan, especially misconduct by attorneys, very seriously.\u201d\nThe Fund\u2019s chair, Eric Seiff, admitted that without DA findings, claims often stall. In Brown\u2019s case, he said, \u201cIf we had any kind of document to confirm that the money was received in Zekaria\u2019s escrow account, it would make it a different story.\u201d\nZekaria pleaded guilty to robbing almost $400,000 from three other clients, stealing escrow funds and performing no legal work despite imposing a significant fee. She faces six years in prison if she fails to pay restitution by May.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

If enough are validated, the measure could appear on the May ballot.\nThe push comes six months after Austin began demolition and construction on the long-planned rebuild of its\ndowntown convention center\n.\nDemolition of the old facility is complete, and excavation is now active and on schedule, according to city officials. The project aims to boost rentable space by 70 percent and reopen by spring 2029 \u2014 an expansion city leaders say will make Austin more competitive for major events and bolster tourism revenue.\n\nOpponents, led by environmental attorney and activist Bill Bunch, argue the redevelopment represents a misuse of public funds, citing the volatile nature of the convention industry.\nBunch, who also heads the Save Our Springs Alliance, said Austin United PAC is confident its petition will clear the 20,000 verified-signature threshold, claiming the group pre-screened entries to weed out ineligible voters.\nThe PAC contends the true price tag will reach $5.6 billion when debt service is factored in, far exceeding the city\u2019s $1.6 billion estimate that includes inflation and contingency costs.\nThe ballot measure could inject\nuncertainty\ninto a project central to Austin\u2019s downtown evolution \u2014 one that has already reshaped surrounding real estate expectations.\nDevelopers and\nhotel owners\nhave eyed the convention center\u2019s expansion as a catalyst for future hospitality, retail and mixed-use growth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The retail giant appears to be putting a big piece of the puzzle in place.\nJeff Blau\u2019s Related Companies is nearing a deal to develop a skyscraper at 720-724 Fifth Avenue, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The building may be attached to the Aman hotel and residences adjacent to the site; tenants may even be able to utilize the amenities next door, per the report.\nBlau is negotiating to develop a 225,000-square-foot building. Prada would have a store at the base of the property and corporate offices above that. The building would also feature luxury residences that could command five figures per square foot. Prada would reportedly need to relocate during construction of the property.\nPrada retained JLL to look for development partners earlier this year. The luxury brand fielded meetings with developers in Italy, resulting in Related\u2019s victory over the likes of Vornado Realty Trust and SL Green.\nJLL, Prada, Related, Sutton, SL Green and Vornado all either declined comment or did not return the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn late 2023, the Italy-based fashion company agreed to purchase 724 Fifth Avenue\nfor $425 million\n. Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties was the seller in the deal, which broke down to $6,538 per square foot for the 65,000-square-foot property.\nDays later, another shoe dropped when Prada\u2019s\n$410 million purchase\nof the neighboring property at 720 Fifth Avenue was revealed.

        "content": "A pair of developers propose two separate Live Local Act projects in Miami with 791 units combined, continuing the flurry of applications under the state\u2019s workforce housing law.\nIn the Wynwood Norte neighborhood, Alexis Bogomolni\u2019s ABH Developer Group wants to build the 36-story, 293-unit Wyn Park at 3311 and 3327 Northwest Second Avenue, 169 Northwest 33rd Street and 182 Northwest 34th Street, according to the developer\u2019s filings to the city.\nIn Overtown, an entity tied to restaurateur Alan Omsky, co-founder of KYU restaurant, proposes a 55-story, 498-unit tower 1210 Northwest Second Avenue and 211 and 223 Northwest 12th Street, according to the developer\u2019s filings.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board will vote on each proposal at its meeting on Wednesday.\nDesigned by Modis Architects, Wyn Park would rise atop a nine-story parking podium with commercial space, and would consist of studio and one- and two-bedroom apartments. It will have 117 apartments with below-market rate rents, in line with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement that at least 40 percent of a project\u2019s units are for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nOmsky\u2019s Kobi Karp-designed tower would have 200 apartments at below-market rate rents, which also equates to 40 percent of the total units. It would consist of studios, one- and two-bedroom units, plus 200 micro-units spanning over 275 square feet each. The application doesn\u2019t specify whether the micro-units will be the below-market rate rentals. The tower will rise atop a nine-story podium with exterior murals of portraits of Overtown residents by artist Yana Volf.\n\nThe\nLive Local Act\n, a state law approved in 2023, allows developers to build bigger buildings as long as they include below-market rate apartments. The units have to remain designated for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI for at least 30 years.\nMiami-based ABH Developer, founded in 2021 by Bogomolni, is a real estate investment, land entitlement and development firm, according to its website. It lists projects in Bay Harbor Islands, Hollywood, Wynwood and Wynwood Norte.\nThe Wyn Park project appears to have been tweaked and enlarged under the Live Local Act. ABH\u2019s website describes it as a 120-unit mixed-use project with multifamily, offices and retail.\nThe firm has had a hefty Wynwood Norte\nfocus\n, where its projects include the six-story, 44-unit Wyn Ave with 2,400 square feet of retail at 3332 Northwest Fifth Avenue; the five-story, 24-unit W35 with 2,500 square feet of retail at 319 Northwest 35th Street. Both are apartment buildings.\nWynwood Norte\nis a district near Wynwood that city officials approved in 2021, spurring more development. Proponents have argued the zoning rules also will preserve the district\u2019s character. Wynwood Norte spans about 140 acres between Northeast and Northwest 29th Street and 36th Street, and between North Miami Avenue and Northwest Seventh Avenue.\nOvertown\n, once a preeminent commerce and culture center for Miami\u2019s Black community, is experiencing redevelopment, including with affordable housing. Housing Trust Group and NBA Hall of Famer Alonzo Mourning\u2019s nonprofit AM Affordable Housing plan the $58 million\nCourtside Apartments II\nwith 120 affordable apartments in a pair of seven-story buildings at 1698 Northwest Third Avenue and 1501 Northwest Fourth Avenue.\nOthers are bringing luxury development to Overtown. Last summer, PMG, Michael Simkins\u2019 Lion Development Group and Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development launched sales of the 22-story. 372-unit short-term rental-friendly\nOne West Twelve Residences\ncondo project at 105 Northwest 11th Terrace.",

        "content": "As LuxUrban Hotels winds its way through the bankruptcy process, a branch of the Justice Department is calling for an independent trustee to be placed in charge of the company.\nAttorneys for the Office of the U.S. Trustee filed a motion last week for an independent trustee to take over the bankrupt firm, Bisnow\nreported\n. The motion described the bankruptcy case as a \u201cfree fall\u201d and described \u201cchaos\u201d encountered by customers and creditors alike, pointing to \u201cgross negligence\u201d on the part of LuxUrban.\n\u201cA hotel operator \u2026 that leaves customers stranded, places people in rooms where no services are available, and where union workers appear to have been unpaid, is untenable, and dangerous,\u201d said U.S. Trustee trial attorney Andrea Schwartz.\nLuxUrban filed for bankruptcy a month ago, citing less than $10 million in assets and at least $50 million in liabilities. The company said the Chapter 11 filing would allow it to continue operating four hotels in New York City.\nShortly after the filing, however, news outlets reported that paying customers\nwere showing up\nto claim room reservations at the company\u2019s Manhattan properties, only to be turned away. That prompted letters to the bankruptcy judge, requesting an emergency hearing due to potential consumer harm.\nOne of those letters was sent on the same day the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council alleged that LuxUrban owed weeks of wages to unionized workers and managers. The union also claimed the company was illegally withholding at least $57 million in retirement contributions.\n\nThere are at least 85 lawsuits pending against LuxUrban in either state or federal court, according to Schwartz. The attorney also claimed LuxUrban omitted additional creditors and debtors in its initial bankruptcy filing, including $118 million in overdue state sales taxes.\nLuxUrban\u2019s bankruptcy attorney, Leo Jacobs, did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nThe company has faced a myriad of issues in New York.\nAt the 166-key property known as The Herald, LuxUrban allegedly\nracked up at least $1.6 million in arrears\nthrough December, leading a judge to approve the landlord\u2019s eviction request this summer as ownership tried to fend off foreclosure.\nOther problems range from\na $1.2 million city fine\nover illegal Airbnb rentals to a Nasdaq delisting. The company\u2019s also been accused of overstating its hotel holdings and is facing a shareholder class action lawsuit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Justin Rundle is rescinding his accusations that his ex-business partners, the father-and-son team that leads Canero Group, allegedly committed fraud and misappropriated project funds in connection with six developments in Miami-Dade County.\nOn Sept. 19,\nRundle\n, son of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Rundle, voluntarily dismissed his lawsuit against Jose Canero Sr., Jose Canero Jr., Miami-based Canero Group, and Ricardo Casanova, a business associate of the Caneros, after reaching a settlement, court records show.\nRundle\nsought in excess of $3 million in damages after investing $625,000 in the projects, and also claiming to have raised $6.3 million from other investors. In an emailed statement provided by his attorney, Rundle said an \u201cindependent third-party accountant has made a finding that there was no fraud or misappropriation of funds.\u201d\n\u201cI have accepted that opinion and hereby withdraw all fraud allegations previously made against the Caneros and Casanova,\u201d Rundle\u2019s statement said, adding that he is no longer a partner in the six projects, which include a 54-unit townhouse project in Homestead and a 10-townhome development in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside neighborhood.\nRundle\u2019s lawyer, Melanie Damian, said her client reached a confidential settlement with the Caneros and Casanova.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Canero Jr. said Coral Gables-based accounting firm Shechter &amp; Everett conducted a full review of the entities that own the projects.\nCanero Group\n, founded in 2012, has built \u201ca reputation for honesty and transparency,\u201d Canero Jr. added.\n\u201cEveryone connected with The Canero Group is extremely grateful to get this matter behind us,\u201d Canero Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult when one\u2019s reputation and character are unjustly assailed, but have been vindicated.\u201d\nCanero Group primarily focuses on development of luxury homes and townhouses, but recently expanded into multifamily projects. In May, the firm paid a combined\n$17.3 million\nto buy out all the owners of Chateau Grove, a 25-unit condominium in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. Canero Group plans to convert the property into apartments.\nIn his May complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, Rundle alleged that the Caneros grossly mismanaged the projects. Rundle also accused the Caneros of paying themselves and Canero Group expenses by using project funds without investors\u2019 authorizations.\nIn a June response to Rundle\u2019s lawsuit, Canero Jr. and his father accused their ex-business partner of skirting Florida Bar rules governing conflicts of interests. Rundle, a real estate attorney who previously represented\nCanero Group\non some transactions, allegedly got into business with Canero Sr. and Canero Jr. without first obtaining a conflict of interest waiver from both of them, the response states.\nInstead, Rundle allegedly sought to get the Caneros to sign the waiver in 2024, two years after they became partners, according to the response. The Caneros also alleged Rundle attempted to sideskirt an arbitration clause in the operating agreements for the entities that own the projects.",

        "content": "DuPage County officials are preparing to bring\nshort-term rentals\nout of the regulatory shadows.\nA zoning amendment before the County Board would allow and regulate short-term rentals in unincorporated areas, eliminating a rule only permitting stays of 30 days or more, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\nThe move comes as local leaders across the suburbs wrestle with how to manage Airbnb- and Vrbo-style listings that have proliferated in residential neighborhoods.\nThere are between 65 to 300\nshort-term rentals\noperating in unincorporated DuPage County areas, said Paul Hoss, the county\u2019s planning and zoning administrator.\n\u201cThe only time that we hear about them is typically when there are parties that get out of hand or property damage complaints,\u201d Hoss told the outlet.\nUnder the proposal, short-term rental hosts would be required to register annually, pay a yet-to-be-determined fee and submit to yearly inspections to ensure compliance with building, health and stormwater codes. County Board member Sam Tornatore, who chairs the development committee, said the measure represents regulatory and revenue opportunity.\nThe fees would funnel into a county housing fund to support long-term affordability efforts, including low-interest loans and construction financing. The plan aligns with County Board Chair Deb Conroy\u2019s broader housing strategy, which includes a proposed $5 million down-payment assistance program for first-time buyers, to be launched using surplus funds from the 2025 budget.\n\nThe amendment also caps occupancy at five unrelated guests per property, though hosts could seek special event permits for larger gatherings. Inspectors would ensure compliance with county and state codes before properties are cleared for operation.\nIf approved, DuPage would join a growing number of suburban governments taking a structured approach to short-term rentals, balancing resident complaints with demand from homeowners looking to monetize their properties.\nOther cities have addressed issues with short-term rentals with various strategies.\nChicago aldermen squabbled this spring over whether to lower the threshold of ward-wide bans on short-term rentals if enough residents sign a\npetition\n.\nHighland Park blocked a timeshare plan for \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of Michael Jordan\u2019s former\nestate\nlast month.\nNaperville banned short-term rentals in 2020, while other municipalities have adopted hybrid systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The properties are owned by affiliates of San Francisco-based Swift Real Estate Partners, and Newmark has the listing.\nThe offices are Mount Diablo Plaza, a two-building, 340,600-square-foot office property in Walnut Creek; Amberglen, a 157,700-square-foot office in Hillsboro, Oregon; and Bel-Kirk 520, a 92,800-square-foot office in\nBellevue, Washington\n.\nSwift\nbought Mount Diablo Plaza in 2017 for $117 million. It purchased Amberglen that same year and Bel-Kirk 520 two years later. The loan originated for $101.7 million between 2017 and 2019 and was cross-collateralized last February. The Walnut Creek property accounts for 82 percent of the unpaid principal balance on the loan.\nThe listing opens the door for an investor to acquire the three office properties via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. That maneuver has become common in the region over the past year.\n\nLast October,\nLakeside Group took ownership\nof 180 Grand, an office building in Uptown Oakland, via deed in lieu after\npaying about $30 million\nwith Rubicon Point Partners to acquire the property\u2019s debt.\nIn December, Blox Ventures bought the debt secured by an eight-story office building in Emeryville Public Market; it acquired the property outright earlier this year. And in July, the debt tied to Oakland\u2019s Bruener Building hit the market.\nMount Diablo Plaza is 61 percent leased. Power company Calpine Corporation is the anchor tenant at the property. Under Swift\u2019s ownership, the firm made $13 million of capital investments at the offices, including a revamp of the common areas. Tenants have access to an onsite conference center, fitness center and cafeteria.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 273-key property, housed in the iconic clock tower overlooking Madison Square Park, will continue to operate under the Edition brand.\nIn a separate deal, Cain closed on its $175 million purchase of the\nDominick Hotel\nin Soho from CIM Group, sources said. Hudson Bay Capital provided a $155 million loan for the deal.\n\nCIM acquired the 391-key property, formerly known as the Trump Soho Hotel Condominium, through foreclosure in 2014. The firm rebranded the 46-story tower in 2017 after ending a licensing agreement with the Trump Organization. CIM considered selling the hotel several times in recent years, first in 2019 and then again in September 2022. Cain will likely look to reposition the property, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Kam Sang, CIM Group and Cain International did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Eastdil Secured\u2019s Jeffrey Davis and Scott Ellman advised on both deals. Eastdil\u2019s Rob Turner arranged the financing. Eastdil declined to comment.\nThe deals come as New York\u2019s occupancy rates approach pre-pandemic levels and the city\u2019s luxury hotel market surges on the back of rebounding tourism and business travel.\nThe average occupancy rate surpassed 84 percent a week in 2024, up from a pandemic low of about 50 percent, according to a report by Lodging Analytics Research &amp; Consulting.

        "content": "Developer Moishe Mana could be on the hook for $6.6 million to Miami-Dade County tied to a decade-old land swap deal.\nMana\n, who is considered the biggest landlord in downtown Miami and Wynwood, had made a deal with Miami-Dade to trade properties in Wynwood, and he was supposed to develop a Puerto Rican community center and other facilities on one of the lots. But the project never came to fruition.\nNow, Mana and the county have struck another deal. On Thursday, the Miami-Dade Appropriations Committee will vote on a new agreement, which frees Mana from having to develop the project \u2014 as long as he makes the $6.6 million payment and complies with other terms of the agreement. The county plans to use the funds to develop affordable housing.\nMiami-Dade commissioners are expected to consider the item at their Nov. 4 meeting.\nMiami-Dade \u201ctook the money and the land. That\u2019s what I understand from them,\u201d Mana said. \u201cMy lawyer has been dealing with it. But they need to get paid.\u201d\nUnder the original 2015\nland swap agreement\n, Mana was supposed to transfer to the county the 0.4-acre parcel at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue, and the county was to transfer to him a 1.4-acre property at 270 Northwest 23rd Street. Because the county was giving Mana a bigger, \u201cmore valuable\u201d property, according to the memo included in the county committee item, he was supposed to build the Puerto Rican center, and offices for the Miami-Dade\nCommunity Action and Human Services Department and the district 3 commissioner at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue.\nDue to environmental contamination on the development site, Miami-Dade and Mana tweaked their agreement in 2018, with Mana now transferring to the county the 0.4-acre site at 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue where he also would build the 43,600-square-foot Puerto Rican community center and county offices. The project\u2019s estimated cost was $8.4 million, and the county was to contribute $2.5 million from the Building Better Communities General Obligation Bond.\nThe deal was amended twice in 2019 and 2020 to extend the construction deadline and allow for a smaller facility. In 2022, commissioners directed county staff members to re-negotiate the agreement entirely, this time removing Mana\u2019s obligation to develop the project in exchange for the $6.6 million payment.\n\nThe county plans to build affordable housing at 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue, partly funded with Mana\u2019s payment.\nMana, who called this \u201can old deal\u201d that \u201cevolved\u201d over the years, said it was Miami-Dade that decided not to build the Puerto Rican community center and other facilities.\nProperty records show the county transferred the site at 270 Northwest 23rd Street to Mana in 2015, and the parcels at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue and 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue remain under the ownership of Mana affiliates.\nMana, who has come under scrutiny regarding his slow-moving projects in Miami, recently expanded his Wynwood portfolio. Last month, he paid\n$25.5 million\nfor the 0.7-acre assemblage at 2200-2230 Northwest Second Avenue and 224 Northwest 22nd Terrace in Wynwood.\nIn July, he scored a\n$150 million\nrefinancing for 56 Wynwood properties surrounding the Mana Wynwood Convention Center.\nCurrently, he is focused on his\ndowntown Miami\nredevelopment, he said. He has described his plan as a campus, often using terms such as \u201cconnectivity\u201d among the residents and companies.\nHe has been targeting tech firms in Latin America as potential tenants, mainly through his Mana Tech organization, he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s not about the buildings. It\u2019s really about the content,\u201d he said, adding that the city\u2019s permitting process is cumbersome and slow. \u201cThe idea is we are working on making Latin America and North America one economy.\u201d\n",

Meli\u00e1 Miami Brickell will mark the first Meli\u00e1-branded residential project in Miami. It was previously called Visions at Brickell Station.\nThorne said he also signed a deal with Meli\u00e1 to brand a 520-key hotel in Orlando.\nUNCG\nhired Compass earlier this year\nto handle sales and marketing of Visions at Brickell Station, but parted ways shortly after making the announcement and brought sales in-house. The developer had a ceremonial groundbreaking, but construction did not begin until recently.\nThorne said he will offer agents 10 percent commissions until the end of the year. Sixty percent of those commissions will be paid after the rescission period ends on each contract, with the remaining 40 percent paid at closing.\nThorne said he has presold 58 units. \u201cWe hope to be sold out in six months,\u201d he said.\n\nThe developer secured a $30 million construction loan from Arixa Enhanced Income Fund in September, and construction is underway. It\u2019s expected to be completed in about 20 months, Thorne said.\nProperty records show Thorne paid $8.5 million for the 0.3-acre site in 2023.\nThe design team includes Miami Lakes-based DTI Architects and interior designer Adriana Hoyos, according to a press release.\nUNCG\u2019s portfolio of residential projects includes hundreds of planned condos and townhomes in Orlando, as well as the planned\nElle Residences Miami\n. Thorne is partnering with Fernando de Nu\u00f1ez y Lugones\u2019 Vertical Developments on the 25-story, 180-unit magazine-branded tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater neighborhood.\nThe majority of condo-hotels and short-term rental-friendly condo projects in Miami\u2019s pipeline are concentrated in Brickell, downtown Miami and surrounding neighborhoods, which is expected to result in an oversupply of these units competing with each other, experts say. Investors\nare attracted to condo-hotels\nbecause of the prices and the promise of rental income.\nMeli\u00e1 branded a\ncondo-hotel tower in Hollywood Beach\nthat was completed in 2018.\n",

Shop Companies\u2019 Jake Sherrington is handling retail and restaurant leasing.\nThe larger Lakeside Village project \u2014 already 80 percent complete \u2014 includes 40 shops and restaurants, 1,090 garden-style apartments, 260 single-family homes, a 207-key hotel, 48 condo units and 165,000 square feet of office space.\nRealty Capital recently finished construction on a parking structure and is designing a wedding venue and Marriott Autograph Collection hotel within an expanding entertainment district.

The property was most recently appraised at $1.19 billion \u2014 south of the $2 billion it was at a decade ago, per Morningstar Credit.\nThe new valuation follows the property\u2019s loan being sent to special servicing and then modified. Cash flow is down at the building but investors say tenant improvements are coming.\nThe property, a 44-story office building between West 47th and 48th streets, is better known as the News Corp building, since it\u2019s home to the Fox News studios, as well as the offices for News Corp publications the Wall Street Journal and New York Post.\nBeacon Capital Partners purchased 1211 Sixth Avenue in 2006 for more than $1.5 billion, the New York Times\nreported\n. Quebecois firm Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge (now called La Caisse) then bought a 49 percent stake in 2013 before purchasing the entirety of the property three years later, for a total value of $1.8 billion.\n\nHowever, conditions at the office building have not kept up the momentum since then. Though revenue improved nominally, it declined in real terms. Last year, revenue was about $170 million, down from an inflation-adjusted $187 million in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit.\nLaw firm Ropes &amp; Gray, which occupies about 17 percent of the space, announced it would be relocating ahead of its 2027 lease expiration.\nDeveloper RXR bought a\n49 percent stake\nin the Midtown building this past January. The property\u2019s loan, with $1.04 million outstanding, was transferred to special servicing in May ahead of an August maturity date. But by the end of the summer, the lender agreed to a\nthree-year extension and modification\n.\nEarlier this month, RXR secured a\n$1.45 billion recapitalization\nof the property. About $367 million is expected to go to improving the tenant experience, leasing commissions and finding a new renter for the space Ropes &amp; Gray occupies.\nRXR and La Caisse did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "The San Francisco metro\u2019s housing market is fiercely competitive, even as cities across the country turn to buyers\u2019 markets.\nLast week, 662 single-family homes sold across the metro last month,\naccording\nto Housing Wire. Demand is outpacing supply in the market with the\nmedian listing price for homes\nat nearly $1.3 million.\nHomes spent a median of 42 days on the market and an average of 81 days.\nLast week, the San Francisco metro had 498 new listings, with a median price of $1.2 million and an average of $670 per square foot. Over 28 percent of\nactive listings on the market took price cuts\n. That figure is below trends for the California housing market and across the country.\nAt the high end of the market, competition for homes is ruthless. There\u2019s believed to be a\nmansion shortage\nbecause of the elevated demand and scarce supply.\n\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties\ntold\nthe San Francisco Chronicle.\nMany attribute the increased demand for high-priced properties to the artificial intelligence boom and the\ninflux of companies and workers to the city\nlooking for high-end housing stock.\n\u201cThe future wealth in AI is out and touring homes right now. Some of them are touring $2 million condos. Some of them are touring $20 million houses. That wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, told eht outlet.\nLenders could see steady demand for financing as buyers climb over each other for the limited listings on the market, while sellers might feel a rush to strike while the iron is hot and sell quickly.\nWith the housing market in San Francisco tight overall, buyers will likely continue to run into low supply and steady pricing heading into the winter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "On a recent post in r/realestateinvesting, a New York City resident asked their Reddit peers: \u201cManhattan real estate investment, is it still worth it?\u201d\nThe answer for many condo buyers in the last decade has mostly been \u201cno,\u201d according to a report from Brown Harris Stevens. The firm analyzed over 2,500 condo resales from July 2024 and July 2025 and found that one in three units sold during that time went for a loss.\nSellers who bought between 2016 and 2020 were hit the hardest, with more than half of those that sold in that last year suffering a loss. The vast majority of the more than 700 buyers from before 2010 that sold in the last year saw price appreciation.\nFor those tracking Manhattan pricing over the long term, the results may not come as a surprise. From 2016 to 2024, the\naverage price per square foot for a Manhattan condo\nhas fallen by 4 percent, according to Miller Samuel report for Douglas Elliman.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the public is completely aware of the fact that housing prices in Manhattan for the last decade have been relatively flat,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller.\nThe extended time horizon captures several inflection points that have shaped the Manhattan market.\nThe precedent to the lackluster resales was a period of \u201csuper normal growth\u201d from 2013 to 2015, according to Brown Harris Stevens managing director Jared Antin, before a surge in pricing \u201calmost overnight.\u201d From\n2015 to 2016, median condo sale prices\nincreased over 10 percent, according to Elliman\u2019s 10-year market report.\n\u201cThere was a lot of extrinsic pressure to buy, because you had this FOMO that if you didn\u2019t buy, prices were going to run away,\u201d Antin said. \u201cThat led people to make some potentially less than savvy purchase decisions.\u201d\n\nAs condo projects came to market, a slew of state and local policies dampened the city\u2019s appeal for wealthy buyers.\nThe introduction of the\ncap on state and local tax deductions in 2017\ndisproportionately focused on New Yorkers, who were subject to deductions nearly double that of the next highest county in the country. Two years later, the\ncity implemented a progressive mansion tax\nto replace its flat 1 percent tax on home sales. The mansion tax can stretch as high as 3.9 percent for the city\u2019s most expensive homes.\nBoth policies imposing steeper costs for high-end homebuyers, but the luxury market has seen the most consistent price appreciation. Just 20 percent of the homes in the study that sold for at least $10 million sold for a loss, and for homes bought from 2016 to 2020, the luxury segment was the only one to see price appreciation.\n\u201cYou\u2019re rich and you\u2019re buying because you want it,\u201d Antin said of the luxury market\u2019s resilient buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t really care about what\u2019s happening around you.\u201d\nNew York lost wealthy would-be buyers to low-tax, warm-weather states. From 2018 to 2022, roughly 125,000 New Yorkers moved to Florida and the percentage of millionaires living in the state fell to 8.7 percent from 12.7 percent from 2010 to 2022, according to a Citizen\u2019s Budget Commission report.\nThe trend cooled as the post-pandemic housing boom and skyrocketing insurance costs made South Florida a more expensive destination.\nThe stock market\u2019s unprecedented run over the last five years has also kept money out of New York real estate as investors have watched their bank accounts grow, but fears over a looming market correction have become more pervasive.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interesting pieces that are happening here that could help buoy the purchase market,\u201d Antin said.\n",

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani wants more rental vouchers, but as mayor would he actually make them easy to use? That takes administrative skill, attention to detail and doggedness.\nSo far, no mayor has been willing, let alone able, to reform the bureaucracy that causes apartments to fail inspection for the most infuriating reasons.\nAs one landlord\ntweeted\nthis week, \u201cI\u2019ve had a unit fail because of a single screw missing in a 4 screw window guard. The super was right there, proper tools, corrected the issue in 5 minutes. Nope, failed. Next available appointment for inspection was a month later.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeless Services claims that most reinspections occur within 72 hours. If that\u2019s true, it must be because landlords who are asked to wait longer say \u201cno thanks\u201d \u2014 and rent to someone without a voucher.\nRegardless, an inspector should never reject an apartment because of a missing screw that the superintendent replaced on the spot.\nIn another case, a unit failed inspection because a 79-cent\noutlet cover was cracked\n. Can you imagine? \u201cBack to the homeless shelter, people, this apartment is unsafe!\u201d\nThey are not unsafe dwellings, of course. They are perfectly legal for tenants without vouchers to rent, but not for tenants with vouchers. Think about that. The city discriminates against voucher holders \u2014 which is\nillegal for landlords\n.\nThis results in situations where a homeless mother with a 4-year-old kid finds a place she wants, and the landlord is willing to rent it to her, but cannot because the second bedroom is one floor plank short of 80 square feet.\nWhy not let the tenant sign a waiver allowing her to move into the apartment despite the 79-square-foot bedroom or the cracked, 79-cent outlet cover? These are not hazardous conditions.\nI\u2019m sure Mamdani would agree. But that doesn\u2019t mean, if elected, that he will hire a DHS commissioner capable of fixing it and that he will hold the commissioner\u2019s feet to the fire.\nThe other problem with being mayor is that a thousand other fires pop up and some of your original goals fall by the wayside.\nNo doubt some readers are saying, \u201cCuomo could fix the voucher problem.\u201d He has more experience getting things done than Mamdani, but Cuomo left a lot of things unfixed as governor.\nProperty taxes\n, for one.\nI once asked Cuomo, when he was governor, why he doesn\u2019t fix Labor Law 240, the infamous \u201cscaffold law,\u201d which makes insurance more expensive for public and private projects.\nThe governor answered that the law was strongly defended by the trial lawyers, which he called the most powerful lobby in Albany. Besides, he said, he focuses on a few priorities at a time, but the scaffold law was, like, eighth on the list. Meaning he wouldn\u2019t get to it.\nA governor or a mayor only has so much political capital and so much bandwidth. To fix a lot of problems at once requires delegating them to staff. Mike Bloomberg was a delegator. Cuomo was a micromanager.\n\nWhat would Mamdani be? Nobody knows.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIn response to a previous Daily Dirt, a reader opined, \u201cNo sane owner who understands the construction process will willingly landmark a property.\u201d The reader is a longtime real estate professional who sits on the board of a religious institution that was landmarked against its leaders\u2019 wishes. \u201cThe extra cost and time is significant even for the most simple items,\u201d the reader lamented. \u201cCar runs into your fence, [it takes] over a year to replace it.\u201d\nEver had a bad experience with the Landmarks Preservation Commission? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The early days of electrification generated a lot of opposition in New York City. In 1889, the mayor dispatched employees to remove wires from rooftops because he considered them ugly. New Yorkers cheered when electrical poles on Broadway were chopped down.\nElsewhere\u2026\nBecause a multifamily development\u2019s eligibility for 421a and 485x are determined by whether the footings are installed before or after June 15, 2022, to switch from the first tax abatement to its successor, developers would have to rip the footings out and put them back in.\nAs preposterous as that might sound, state law does not offer an alternative, said Daniel Bernstein, an attorney at Rosenberg &amp; Estis who deals with the tax abatements.\nFudging the installation dates of load-bearing elements is not advisable. A project\u2019s architect typically certifies the commencement date, but city officials check the building permit to ensure that it\u2019s consistent with the filing, Bernstein said.\nBecause 421a is more generous than 485x, the only reason a developer would switch is if the project misses the 421a\ncompletion deadline\n\u2014 which for affordability Option C is\nJune 15, 2026\n. The other 421a options \u2014 which require deeper affordability, but still not as deep as 485x \u2014 have a 2031 completion deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens with stalled 421a projects that cannot meet those deadlines for whatever reason,\u201d Bernstein said.\nTo avoid the absurdity of forcing a developer to remove and reinstall a foundation, state lawmakers could remove June 16, 2022, as the opening date of the 485x eligibility window. A fair question is why they included it in the first place.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$12.3 million\nfor a 2,783-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at ONE11 Residences, 111 West 56th Street in the Plaza District. Maria Mainieri, Taylor Middleton and Peter Evangelidis of Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$42.3 million\nfor 6201 and 6310 15th Avenue in Borough Park.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$6.5 million\nfor a 2,793-square-foot condominium unit at 60 Beach Street in Tribeca. Mark Jovanovic and the Paradigm Advisory team at Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 1,039,645-square-foot, 16-story jail at 125 White Street in Civic Center. Eric Van Epps of HOK Architects filed the permit on behalf of Eduardo del Valle of the NYC Department of Design and Construction.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Long considered a shoo-in for\none of three casino licenses up for grabs\nin New York, MGM Resorts has dropped out of the competition.\nThe company, which pitched a $2.3 billion expansion of its facility in Yonkers, announced Tuesday that it is withdrawing its proposal.\nThe news comes as a surprise, after a community advisory committee unanimously\napproved\nthe proposal last month. The casino, alongside another existing slot parlor, Queens Aqueduct Casino, seemed best positioned to snag two of the available state licenses, given that they already had operating facilities.\nBut in a statement, MGM blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d pointing to the fact that the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nAll of the remaining competitors are located in the outer boroughs: the Queens Aqueduct, Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park in Flushing and Bally\u2019s Bronx project.\nThe company also banked on receiving an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state\nlast week\n, the Yonkers proposal would only qualify for 15 years.\nThe length of the license coincides with how much an applicant is investing in the project. MGM pegged theirs at $2.3 billion, with $1.8 billion in capital investments.\n\n\u201cSince submitting our application in June, the competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our application have shifted, altering our return expectations on the proposed $2.3 billion investment,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nGiven these concerns, MGM also likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to propose competitive tax rates for the slot machines and table games. Each of the teams submitted rate proposals to the state on Tuesday. Resorts World pitched a 56 percent tax for slots and 30 percent for table games. Metropolitan Park\u2019s team proposed 25 percent for slots and 10 percent for table games.

The price works out to $3,679 per square foot and $7.8 million per acre. It was last on the market in 2017 with a $129 million asking price, down from the\nlist price of $195 million\nin 2014, when it was the most expensive home for sale in the country.\nThe 53,000-square-foot home, at 9505 Lania Lane, has been a rental property for infrequent visitors like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. As a rental, it cost about $425,000 per year.\nThe seller is\nreal estate billionaire Jeff Greene\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest single property in Beverly Hills by far,\u201d Greene told the outlet. \u201cOnce you get to our gate, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a long, double-wide, meandering road through the vineyards up to the top. You are completely secure.\u201d\nThe 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property has a 15,000-square-foot entertainment wing with a 50-seat movie theater, a bowling alley and a disco with a rotating dance floor. The primary suite has a living room, two walk-in closets and a Turkish spa.\n\nThe 6-acre vineyard on the grounds produces cabernet sauvignon and sangiovese wine under the label Beverly Hills Vineyards, and a wine-tasting room has temperature-controlled storage for 10,000 bottles.\nOther nine-figure listings in SoCal include 10644 Bellagio Road in Bel Air, which is asking $190 million,\nper\nRealtor.com. The seven-bedroom mansion, known as\nCasa Encantada\n, is on an 8.4-acre property and features several dining rooms, orchards, a 60-foot tiled pool and a tennis pavilion.\nThe 18,400-square-foot property at 620 Arkell Drive in Beverly Hills is asking for $100 million. And a new-build at 3405 Fryman Road in Studio City, once the\nsite of Alex Trebek\u2019s home\n, is on the market for $42 million, as well as a Tuscan estate in Bel Air at 701 Nimes Road for just under $40 million.\nCloser to the beach, there\u2019s an 11,100-square-foot estate with Pacific Ocean views at 6 Mystique in Newport Coast on the market for $65 million. Ultra-luxury buyers can also look into a 13,600-square-foot estate at 670 Hot Springs Road in Montecito for $60 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Construction started in May on the 270-acre site, near the University of North Texas at Dallas and Interstate 20.\nCity Manager Kimberly Tolbert hinted the increase was forthcoming during a ceremonial groundbreaking this spring, WFAA\nreported\nat the time.\nPlans from the firm, headed by Mike Hoque, call for thousands of residential units, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and more than 50 acres of green space. The project could create a commercial hub in an area where the median income is about 60 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth average.\nThe Dallas-based firm\u2019s project has been riddled with\ndelays\n. The Dallas City Council approved amendments to the development agreement in December, extending deadlines and increasing the public subsidy to $35.9 million.\nThe firm\u2019s minimum investment requirement rose to $62 million, and it was tasked with selling an additional 50 lots to third-party builders.\nThat amounted to Hoque Global selling 580 lots in University Hills to D.R. Horton and Lennar for townhome and single-family development.\n\nA 60-day deadline to finalize the land purchase agreement and begin construction was met within days of the groundbreaking.\nHoque projects have stalled out in the past due to missing key milestones. The firm missed a deadline last year for vertical construction at its $50 million mixed-use project in Mansfield, but the city offered a\nsecond chance\n.\nFort Worth kicked the firm to the\ncurb\nlast year. It was removed as the master developer for the Evans and Rosedale Urban Village last April, after the city cited \u201cunacceptable delays.\u201d\nHoque did not reapply for the Urban Village project but contested those claims at the time.\nOther recent projects include partnering up with Mike Ablon on a Bank of America Plaza acquisition.\nHoque and PegasusAblon received initial\napproval\nlast month from Dallas city advisory boards for over $100 million in public incentives for a $409 million redevelopment of the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper at 901 Main Street.\nThe development duo aims to convert parts of the 1.9 million-square-foot building into hotel, event, and retail space, and add a new parking structure.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Weeks after the Boca Raton City Council agreed to wait for a voter referendum on Terra and Frisbie Group\u2019s proposed government campus redevelopment, the battle over the project is heating up.\nLocal attorney Ned Kimmelman filed suit against Save Boca, the group leading opposition to the project, and its founder, Jon Pearlman, earlier this week. The suit, filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeks an emergency injunction to invalidate the petitions circulated by Save Boca in the referendum efforts, filings show. Save Boca collected 7,000 signed petitions opposing the project.\nIn the suit, Kimmelman, a Boca Raton resident, accuses Save Boca and Pearlman of spreading misinformation to \u201cinduce people/voters to sign the petition.\u201d\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the suit alleges. Save Boca and Pearlman are seeking an amendment to Boca Raton\u2019s city charter that would prevent the council from selling or leasing land greater than half an acre, something the suit says would cause an \u201cunworkable, very expensive\u201d government crisis.\nKimmelman could not be immediately reached for comment. Pearlman also did not respond to an immediate request for comment.\nThe government campus redevelopment proposal at the heart of the issue is called One Boca, led by\nDavid Martin\u2019s\nTerra and the Frisbie family\u2019s namesake\nFrisbie Group\n. It is slated to include city offices, apartments, condos and retail on public land in downtown Boca Raton. This would include redeveloping the existing city hall at 201 West Palmetto Road. The proposal includes a 99-year lease of public land to Terra and Frisbie.\n\nAt a Sept. 9 meeting, the city\ncouncil voted to delay approval\nof the project\u2019s 99-year land lease until after a voter referendum on the project. Terra and Frisbie\nbeat out Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross\n, New York-based Namdar Group, and Atlanta-based RocaPoint Partners in a bidding process that concluded in February.\nAt a city council workshop on Tuesday concerning One Boca, Frisbie partner Rob Frisbie Jr. confirmed the developers would have new plans to present at city meetings on Oct. 27 and 28. The scope is being reduced from the previously planned 30 acres.\nSupporters of Save Boca attending the meeting decried the project as a betrayal of public trust, a land grab, and raised concerns about gopher tortoise habitat. One Save Boca supporter invoked Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d anti-drug campaign in his plea to the city council.\nFrisbie said his team has been conducting community meetings to address concerns from the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in the design phase where we\u2019re listening and incorporating additional feedback from the community,\u201d he said, adding that the developers are focused on enhancing Boca Raton\u2019s Memorial Park in the next set of plans.\nFollowing the Oct. 27 and 28 meetings, the proposal will go to a voter referendum on Mar. 10, 2026.",

        "content": "Let me know if this sounds familiar:\nPrivately owned multifamily buildings constructed decades ago in New York City are falling apart because residents are not paying enough each month to maintain them.\nRings a bell, doesn\u2019t it?\nHere\u2019s more:\nLawmakers recognize the problem and are springing into action. To bring these buildings into a state of good repair while keeping them affordable for hardworking New Yorkers, city and state officials are coming to the rescue with tens of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d you say. \u201cThat is not happening. They haven\u2019t done squat for rent-stabilized buildings!\u201d\nIndeed they haven\u2019t. But I was not referring to rent-stabilized buildings, which Albany has left to crumble by starving them of revenue while their already-high property taxes somehow keep rising.\nRather, there is another kind of property that, in stark contrast, occupies a special place in lawmakers\u2019 hearts: Mitchell-Lama co-ops.\nSince Gov. Hochul took office, she has showered Mitchell-Lamas across the state with nearly $500 million. That\u2019s\u00a0 $4,762 per unit, on average, but some have received much more. One agency alone has gifted $265 million to 24,000 Mitchell-Lama apartments \u2014 more than $11,000 apiece.\nHad the governor doled out money at the same rate to New York City\u2019s 966,000 rent-stabilized units, the total would have come to $4.6 billion.\nIn the spring, Hochul and state legislators passed a budget that cut taxes for Mitchell-Lamas in half, saving them $50 million a year. But that didn\u2019t apply to an \u201cArticle V\u201d co-op known as Penn South.\n\nThe Manhattan property\u2019s shareholders have kept their maintenance fees too low to actually take care of the building. That might sound harsh, because some residents \u2014 we don\u2019t know how many \u2014 probably can\u2019t afford to pay more.\nBut housing has to be paid for. It doesn\u2019t fix itself, heat itself, paint itself or insure itself. So the state is letting the city give Penn South a $2 million annual tax cut.\n\u201cI commend the governor for recognizing the sky-high costs to operate housing and her work to help Mitchell Lama buildings across the city from choosing between deferred maintenance or double-digit rate increases,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cI can only hope the same approach and attention is offered to the nearly 2 million residents living in rent-stabilized housing.\u201d\nRead that last sentence closely and you might pick up a hint of sarcasm. Burgos knows the state has barely lifted a finger for his members\u2019 buildings since essentially freezing their rents in 2019.\nMitchell-Lamas are often hailed as a triumph of Albany, which established the middle-class co-ops in 1955. But as it turned out, they were\nnot sustainable\n. That\u2019s why city and state lawmakers have been running from building to building, plugging holes in the dike with\ntax dollars from everyone else\n.\nThese cash infusions are always portrayed in press releases and fawning media coverage as acts of altruism by elected officials, rather than as bailouts of buildings whose shareholders deferred maintenance so they could save money \u2014 in some cases out of necessity, in others to\nbuy a condo in Florida\n.\nTo be fair, the midcentury legislators who crafted the program, Manhattan Sen. MacNeil Mitchell and Brooklyn Assembly member Aldred Lama, gave these co-ops the option to eventually become market-rate, which would allow them to pay their own bills. But when offered free money by the government to stay in the program, many take it.\nHochul was at it again Tuesday, summoning the media to Manhattan\u2019s Penn South to watch her sign a bill from Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly member Tony Simone to let the city slash its property taxes.\n\u201cPenn South faces rising operational costs, which threaten to impact building quality and future affordability for its residents,\u201d Hochul\u2019s press release said.\nThat is also true for rent-stabilized buildings, except that the rising costs only threaten building quality, not rents. But the state expects landlords to shoulder those costs, and if they can\u2019t, there\u2019s a fallback plan. It\u2019s called foreclosure.\n",

        "content": "After launching construction on a prominent office development without a tenant publicly in place, BXP appears to have found its first taker at 343 Madison Avenue.\nGlobal insurance and investment firm C.V. Starr is\nin agreement\nto lease roughly a third of the 1-million-square-foot development. Further details of the deal were not disclosed and the companies have not commented on the alleged deal, first reported in the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nThe insurance firm previously\nrenewed\nroughly 140,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue in 2016 and expanded by another 71,000 square feet. That office building is also owned by BXP, previously known as Boston Properties.\nThe development site at 343 Madison is a prominent Manhattan project, as BXP is building its 46-story tower with connections to Grand Central Terminal. Still, it\u2019s rare for projects of this size to commence without a large amount of the space pre-leased.\nBXP reportedly had\na letter of intent\nin place with a tenant to take 30 percent of the building\u2019s leasable square footage as of early last month; presumably, C.V. Starr is that tenant.\n\nThe development of 343 Madison has already been fraught with financial challenges. Last month, BXP\nlowered its dividend\nby 30 percent to help pay for the\n$2 billion office tower\n, searching for $50 million in savings on a quarterly basis.\nThe development site of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s former headquarters suffered a blow this summer when Norges Bank\nbacked out of a plan to be a 45 percent partner\nin the project.\nSince then, BXP has been searching for a partner to pick up as much as half of the development cost, which CEO Owen Thomas has said would help land a $1 billion construction loan. The CEO said that BXP\u2019s costs could drop to $500 million under that scenario.\nThe company is also looking to raise $1 billion by selling land and office properties in suburban locations, preparing to finance its project without a partner.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A slumping South Florida office market has some landlords and developers seeking exit strategies.\nAsking rents tumbled in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties in the third quarter, as demand for office space plateaued compared to the same period of last year, a JLL report shows.\nMeanwhile, a handful of distressed properties traded, as some owners sought to cut their losses. For instance, developer\nMichael Shvo\nlast month sold his assemblage at 1656-1680 Alton Road in Miami Beach, including the former Epicure Gourmet Market &amp; Cafe building, for $28.2 million to New York-based Infinity Collective.\nIn 2022, Shvo paid $39.3 million for the properties that he planned to redevelop into The Alton, a planned six-story building with about 17,000 square feet of office space and five apartments. Shvo told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the office project was \u201cno longer the highest and best use for this site.\u201d\nIn another sign of trouble in South Florida\u2019s office market, New York-based R&amp;B Realty lost\nGateway at Wynwood\n, a 12-story office and retail building at 2916 North Miami Avenue, after failing to secure refinancing on a delinquent $112.9 million mortgage. San Diego-based Cire Equity acquired Gateway at Wynwood after purchasing the $89.6 million credit bid from A10 Capital, a lender that won the property at a bankruptcy auction.\nA few bright spots in the third quarter included\nPlayboy\ninking a lease in August for a 20,000-square-foot penthouse at The Rivani, a mixed-use building in Miami Beach owned by real estate investor Robert Rivani.\nPlayboy\nplans to relocate its headquarters from Beverly Hills to South Beach next year, but with a caveat. If the city of Miami Beach does not provide $800,000 in incentives, Playboy can cancel the deal.\nMiami-Dade County\nThe average asking rent in Miami-Dade County dropped to $65.89 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $66.33 a square foot during the same period of last year, the JLL report shows. The vacancy rate remained relatively unchanged at 15.8 percent, compared to 15.5 percent, year-over-year. New construction also slowed a bit in the third quarter to 971,000 square feet, compared to 1.1 million square feet under construction during the same period of last year.\n\nThe third quarter\u2019s largest lease was Miami-based law firm Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff &amp; Sitterson renewing its agreement for 96,800 square feet at\nMuseum Tower,\na 28-story office tower in downtown Miami owned by Moishe Mana.\nIn Wynwood, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\ninked a lease for 25,200 square feet at Wynwood Plaza, a nearly completed mixed-use project.\nBroward County\nLandlords in Broward County experienced a boost in the average asking rent to $48.54 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $42.93 a square foot during the same period of last year, according to JLL. Like Miami-Dade, the vacancy rate in Broward hasn\u2019t moved up or down, staying the same, year-over-year, at 15.9 percent. New construction was also stagnant. In the third quarter, Broward had 340,000 square feet under construction, compared to 354,000 square feet during the same period of last year.\nWhile Broward didn\u2019t have any standout lease signings in the third quarter, the county\u2019s office market did see a flurry of end users opting to buy office space. Among the deals was Richardson, Texas-based Lennox Industries\u2019\n$16 million\npurchase of a 30,000-square-foot building in Fort Lauderdale for the company\u2019s Southeast U.S. headquarters.\nPalm Beach County\nRecently fueled by billionaire Steve Ross\u2019 big bet on West Palm Beach\u2019s office market, Palm Beach County is also experiencing a slowdown.\nThe average asking rent in the county dipped to $68.81 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $70.69 a square foot during the same period of last year, the JLL report shows. The vacancy rate also climbed to 14.4 percent, compared to 13.2 percent, year-over-year. But Palm Beach County is still experiencing a robust development pipeline with 1.1 million square feet under construction in the third quarter, the same as in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe most notable lease signing took place at\n10 CityPlace\n, one of the new office towers in West Palm Beach developed by Ross\u2019 Related Ross. ServiceNow, a cloud computing company, signed a lease to occupy 200,000 square feet, nearly half the space at 10 CityPlace.",

The firm specializes in long-term multifamily investments, according to its website.\nThe property, which is in Du Page County, fits into\nDenver-based Highland\u2019s\ninvestment criteria because it\u2019s a low supply market with a steady population and strong job growth.\nChicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market has been on fire, while once-hot regions like the\nSun Belt cool off\namid oversupply.\n\nThe 1970s-era property also presents an opportunity for rent growth, according to JLL marketing materials. Investors have been circling Du Page county because of its proximity to Chicago without\nthe unpredictable nature of Cook County property taxes\n.\nThe property was 95 percent occupied when it listed and had a 77 percent average retention rate over the past three years. JLL\u2019s Kevin Girard, Mark Stern and Zachary Kaufman represented the seller.\nThe sale, which closed last week, comes on the heels of another suburban multifamily sale in the southwest suburb of Justice.\nChicago-based Waterton sold the Oaks and Laurels of Willow Hill, a 749-unit suburban\napartment community in Justice\nto Santa Monica, California-based Turner Impact Capital, public records show. The sale of that complex, which is about 20 miles southwest of Chicago, came out to about $110,000 per unit.\nBender is still adding to its portfolio as well. A year ago, the company bought the\nArrive at Town Center\n, an 85-unit apartment complex with 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail in north suburban Vernon Hills, from California-based firm FPA Multifamily.",

The listing for the co-op breaks down to $8,400 per square foot.\nLasry and his wife, Cathy, bought the four-bedroom unit in 2013 for $33 million. Adjusted for inflation, the asking represents a loss from the purchase price. But the listing is the most expensive for a co-op in the city, according to StreetEasy.\nThe duplex includes 2,200 square feet of terraces, a living room with a fireplace and views of Central Park, a primary suite with a dressing room and a library with a bar and high ceilings.\nThe 19-story, 109-unit Art Deco building was constructed in 1930 and received pop culture attention for serving as the Shandor Building in the 1984 supernatural comedy. Amenities at the building include a children\u2019s playroom and a roof deck.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Alan Nickman and Stephen O\u2019Neal share the\nlisting\nwith a Compass team including Allison Chiaramonte.\n\nAvenue Capital launched in 1995 and manages more than $10 billion in assets across the globe. Lasry also partnered on the purchase of a stake in the Bucks for $550 million in 2014. In 2023 \u2014 two years after the Bucks ended a half-century championship drought \u2014 Lasry sold his stake to the Haslams in a deal valuing the franchise at $3.5 billion.\nIn 2019, the billionaire\nsold a $9.5 million\n, one-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at 812 Fifth Avenue to William Reeves, co-founder of hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management.\nThe year prior, Lasry sold his six-story townhouse at 4 East 74th Street\nfor $31.5 million\nto an anonymous buyer.

Spec developer Gala Asher was the seller at the time, according to the deed.\nProperty and state records show the home\u2019s owner as a Delaware limited liability company called Crown West, which is managed by Point 72 chief investment officer Andrew B. Cohen and also tied to the same address as the financial firm.\nThe nine-bedroom, 13-bathroom home spans 12,700 square feet. It\u2019s close to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Among the home\u2019s many amenities are a living room bar, elevator, private space to take meetings, waterfall, spa, game room and underground parking.\n\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass has the listing.\nIt was a big week for Glass, who also holds the listing of Los Angeles County\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, along with Compass\u2019 Alexandra Glass.\nThat\u2019s for the home at 1535 Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills, which is listed for just under $27 million, or $2,268 per square foot.\nThe L-shaped home, which is being sold by a trust, was built in 2021 and has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms across nearly 12,000 square feet.\nHighlights include a half-Olympic length pool, spa, 150-year-old olive trees and both city and ocean views.\nTwenty-nine homes in L.A. County went into contract last week, which was one more deal than a year ago, according to the roundup produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team. The report counts homes appearing in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nTotal asking volume was $252.9 million, which was a jump of nearly 47 percent from the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson is preparing to bring back one of Chicago\u2019s most controversial revenue tools \u2014 the corporate head tax \u2014 as the city faces a projected $1.15 billion shortfall next year.\nThat\u2019s according to sources familiar with his upcoming budget proposal, Crain\u2019s first\nreported\n.\nThe\ntax\n, enacted in 1973 and eliminated under Rahm Emanuel in 2014, charged companies with 50 employees or more $4 per worker per month, according to the nonpartisan\nTax Foundation\nas well as the\nInstitute for the Public Good\n, which produced a policy paper in September in support of the proposal.\nThe concept has been derided by the city\u2019s business community as an anti-growth penalty. The\nIllinois Policy\nInstitute came out against the head tax, as well as the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this\nsummer\n.\nJohnson, who will unveil his third spending plan this week, appears ready to test that argument.\nWhile Johnson has repeatedly vowed to make the wealthy and big corporations \u201cput more skin in the game,\u201d his options are narrow. State law bars the city from extending the sales tax to services or imposing a local corporate income tax, leaving him with politically fraught levers like a head tax, higher cloud-computing levies, or inflation-tied hikes to city fines and fees.\nThe mayor\u2019s allies have floated a range of proposals.\n\nThe Institute for the Public Good proposed a tenfold increase to the previous head tax to $40 per employee on large companies, potentially bringing in tens of millions in annual\nrevenue\nand also to bring inflation-adjusted and full-time employee equivalent fees up to par with the impact the $4 head tax had in 1973.\nProgressive Caucus members floated lower sticker prices. Johnson\u2019s team is said to be eyeing a lower rate, aware that he\u2019ll need at least 26 City Council votes to pass a budget that already faces pushback from moderates and business groups.\nCorporate leaders are bracing for a fight.\nThe Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce warned that another tax on employers would discourage hiring and drive investment elsewhere.\n\u201cAdding additional taxes on businesses to fill the budget gap will disincentivize businesses from employing people in Chicago,\u201d CEO Jack Lavin said in a statement. Illinois Policy Institute suggested spending caps, fixing pension debt and other cuts to reign in the budget deficit.\nThe business pushback comes as the administration also weighs extending a citywide hiring freeze and trimming departmental budgets by up to 5 percent. Unions, meanwhile, are lobbying to prevent layoffs and pressing aldermen to embrace new revenue sources instead.\nJohnson\u2019s challenge echoes last year\u2019s bruising budget fight, when his proposed\nproperty tax increase collapsed\nbefore a final vote.\n",

        "content": "The first fully affordable housing project at Bishop Ranch is inching closer to construction.\nThe City of San Ramon approved\nplans for a 200-unit affordable housing development\nfrom\nEden Housing\nat 2453 Camino Ramon, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe company will build residences for seniors and families on a 2.2-acre site donated by Sunset Development, the owner and operator of the office campus and mixed-use community.\nEden Housing\u2019s plans call for a 120-unit residential building for working families; half of the units in the building will have two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Another 80 residences will be constructed for residents 55 and older.\nThe housing will be priced for low-income and very-low income individuals earning 30 percent to 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income, or between\n$33,600 and $87,550\nfor one person.\nThe project site houses a 10,000-square-foot office property, Sunset Development\u2019s service center, which will be torn down. The site is across from City Village, a 404-townhome development from SummerHill Homes, which is under construction.\nAmenities include a technology center, career and school resource center, barbecue and picnic areas, bicycle parking, children\u2019s play areas and co-working areas for adults. The senior residences will have a fitness center, technology center and outdoor deck. There will also be a central communal courtyard, dog park and community garden with direct access to Iron Horse Trail.\nThe development is \u201can investment in San Ramon\u2019s future as an inclusive, sustainable community,\u201d said\nAlex Mehran Jr.\n, CEO of Sunset Development. The development is \u201cespecially critical for families and seniors in a region that is growing rapidly and urgently needs more affordable homes,\u201d said Linda Mandolini, president and CEO of Eden Housing.\n\nThis is the latest instance of offices being replaced with housing as part of the grand plan to transform the office complex into a mixed-use neighborhood. The effort has been helped in part by companies like Chevron cutting their office space at Bishop Ranch in recent years.\nIn June, Sunset Development filed formal development applications to gut 761,000 square feet of office space to make way for two residential communities, adding 485 units of housing as part of the endeavor to\nbuild 8,000 units\non site.\nThat proposal calls for demolishing the three-building, 652,000-square-foot Canopy office complex and building a 412-unit residential community of 255 detached townhomes and a 157-unit five-story apartment building.\nOf the 412 units, 62 will be deed-restricted affordable housing with at least 22 reserved for very-low-income households. Sunset also submitted plans to build 73 housing units at 2 Annabel Lane to replace a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units.\nSunset plans to\nturn the old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\nOther housing projects at Bishop Ranch in the works include Related California\u2019s 380-unit luxury apartment building at 6201 Bollinger Canyon Road and\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A judge temporarily halted the planned transfer of a valuable downtown Miami parcel slated for President Donald Trump\u2019s future presidential library, intervening in a high-profile land deal involving public property.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz issued the temporary injunction on Tuesday, the\nAssociated Press\nreported. The injunction will remain in effect until Ruiz issues a final verdict or Miami Dade College holds a new, publicly noticed meeting to discuss the transfer of the land.\nRuiz sided with Miami activist Marvin Dunn, who on Oct. 6 sued Miami Dade College, alleging the school violated Florida\u2019s open government laws by failing to give adequate public notice before approving the land transfer to the state last month.\nRuiz noted that the college \u201cdidn\u2019t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote,\u201d but emphasized the case was \u201cnot rooted in politics.\u201d\nThe nearly 3-acre property at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n, valued at about $67 million by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser, sits on one of the few remaining undeveloped stretches in\ndowntown Miami\n.\nReal estate analysts said the site \u2014 surrounded by luxury condo towers, two museums and two waterfront parks \u2014 could fetch several times its assessed value if sold on the open market.\n\nThe college\u2019s board of trustees voted during an early morning meeting on Sept. 23 to convey the land to a state fund overseen by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. A week later, the governor and cabinet voted to transfer the parcel to the foundation that will develop\nTrump\u2019s library.\nThat group is led by\nEric Trump\n, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley.\nAttorneys for Dunn argued that the Sept. 23 meeting agenda gave no details about the location or purpose of the transaction. Miami Dade College\u2019s lawyers insisted the board followed legal requirements, and that any delay in transferring the land could cost the college up to $300,000.\nOther Florida universities, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, were previously considered for the library site. State lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation to shield such projects from local government objections.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado\n",

        "content": "Nicki Minaj is in danger of losing her Barbie dream house.\nThe rapper\u2019s\nLos Angeles-area mansion\nis at risk of being sold off due to a sizable unpaid debt that she and her husband, Kenneth Petty, have refused to pay, Us Weekly\nreported\n.\nThe potential seizure stems from a 2019 alleged assault case involving Petty and a security guard, Thomas Weidenmuller, who worked at one of Minaj\u2019s shows in\nGermany\n. Weidenmuller was awarded $503,000 by a court from Minaj and Petty, though he reportedly has yet to receive it. That led to the security guard asking the court on Oct. 6 to order Minaj\u2019s home to be sold to help him collect the money he is owed.\nMinaj owns an 11-bedroom, 16-bathroom\nhome in Hidden Hills\nspanning 11,820 square feet. She purchased it in December 2022 for $19.5 million.\nWeidenmuller said in his motion that he believes the home is worth enough to pay off the\nmortgage\n, liens and the debt he is owed. The plaintiff said that Minaj has a $13.3 million mortgage lien on the home and a \u201c$722,151 homestead exemption \u2014 together just under $14 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe property\u2019s current fair market value is appraised at $20 million, yielding approximately $6 million in equity beyond the lien and exemption. That amount is more than sufficient to satisfy the judgment, plus accrued interest and enforcement costs,\u201d Weidenmuller said.\nWeidenmuller alleged that while working at Minaj\u2019s show on March 22, 2019, a fan broke through the security barrier and was able to get on stage with Minaj. She allegedly became upset with the security team, leading him to tell Petty about what happened. When Weidenmuller entered Minaj\u2019s dressing room, he reportedly was greeted by Minaj, Petty and two security guards, and Petty \u201cwithout warning\u201d struck him in the face. The security guard was rushed to the hospital and doctors determined he suffered serious injuries and required surgery to fix his jaw.\nThe security guard is pursuing the seizure after Minaj and Petty failed to respond to his lawsuit, prompting the court to enter default judgments against the couple in March of last year.\n\u201cAlthough it is regrettable that the extraordinary measure of forcing the sale of Minaj\u2019s dwelling is required, that result is entirely the product of her intransigence in not making payment,\u201d Weidenmuller\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cMinaj is a global music superstar, estimated to have a net worth of anywhere between $150 [million and] 190 million, and is reportedly the highest paid female rap star in the world. There is little doubt that she is highly capable of paying the judgment in full and, yet, she has refused to do so despite multiple written requests for payment and levies served upon several of her suspected creditors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is facing a revolt from lenders over its latest debt proposal, a standoff that could ripple far beyond Wall Street \u2014 all the way to Chicago\u2019s pension funds.\nA group of creditors banded together to block the casino operator\u2019s plan to amend roughly $1.9 billion in term loans Tuesday, Bloomberg\nreported\n, raising fresh doubts about the company\u2019s ability to finance its long-delayed\nChicago resort\n.\nThe junk-rated firm failed to win lender support by last week\u2019s deadline, with investors uneasy about the value of the properties securing the debt and the pace of future repayments.\nAt the center of the dispute is\nBally\u2019s\nattempt to reclassify its under-construction Chicago casino as loan collateral while also seeking approval to sell and lease back its Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort in Rhode Island for $735 million.\nBally\u2019s has said it would use about $500 million from that sale to pay down senior secured debt, including portions of its revolving credit and term loan, trimming first-lien obligations to about $1.94 billion.\nBut creditors want more detail on how the company intends to manage cash and repay debt after recent repayments to Apollo Global Management \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among some investors.\n\nThe dissenting lenders, advised by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, have questioned the declining value of the company\u2019s property collateral and are pressing for new guarantees tied to Bally\u2019s 58 percent stake in Greek gaming company Intralot, acquired through a deal completed earlier this month.\nThe stalemate is a critical obstacle to Bally\u2019s push to extend at least $600 million in term-loan maturities to 2030. Lenders on its revolving facility have already agreed to the extension, arranged by Deutsche Bank, but the broader amendment remains in limbo. Bally\u2019s term loan slid to about 90 cents on the dollar this week, down from 95 on Friday, reflecting mounting investor anxiety.\nFor Chicago, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. The city is counting on the long-promised Bally\u2019s casino \u2014 approved in 2022 and expected to generate hundreds of millions for its underfunded pension systems \u2014 to advance beyond its temporary\nRiver North\nsite.\nBally\u2019s\ninsists its balance sheet is \u201cfantastic,\u201d citing more than $1 billion in cash and credit access. Unless the stalemate breaks, the company\u2019s financing gamble could leave Chicago\u2019s casino dreams on hold.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A McKinney\nmansion\nasking $4.5 million is heading to auction after more than a year on the market.\nThe four-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 2115 Paradise Ranch Trail is on a 10-acre lot. Owned by classic car enthusiasts active in local restoration clubs, the home includes a 6,200-square-foot showroom attached to the 12,500-square-foot home.\nThe property also includes an\nequestrian\nbarn that can accommodate four horses.\nThe sellers listed the home for $5.9 million last July and have modestly reduced the price several times since then. It is one of the most-expensive homes on the market in\nMcKinney\n, a Collin County suburb about 30 miles north of Dallas.\n\nHolly and Andi Haven of Real Broker have the listing, and Florida-based\nElite Auctions\nis handling the auction. Elite has held auctions for other North Texas homes, but this is the company\u2019s first in McKinney. It will take place on site at 11 a.m. Nov. 7.\nMany sellers turn to auctions after exhausting the conventional listing process. Elite Auctions has seen a threefold increase in auction candidates this year, CEO Randy Haddaway said. That might be fueled by a\nsoftening of the luxury market\n, especially in the\nSun Belt\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inventory that needs to be cleaned up around the country,\u201d Haddaway said.\nNationally, luxury sellers are pulling back from the market, according to\nRedfin\n. While some markets have been hit harder, Texas is among those slowing down.\nAustin\n, once a tech boomtown, had one of the highest seller-to-buyer ratios in the country during the hot season, with inventory especially high in the luxury condo class.\nRelistings are taking up an increasingly high share of the state\u2019s ultra-luxury inventory\n, mostly concentrated in Houston and Dallas.\nThe most recent headliner auction in the area was a Southlake mansion at 1469 Sunshine Lane. Previously listed for $27.5 million, the\nhome\u2019s winning bid was $14.22 million\n, less than the expected starting bid.",

        "content": "SL Green is buying the Park Avenue Tower in the Plaza District for $730 million.\nMarc Holiday\u2019s REIT just went into contract to buy the 36-story tower at 65 East 55th Street from the Blackstone Group, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe price tag is a discount to the roughly $925 million that Blackstone put into acquiring and renovating the building since 2014. Investors have come off the sidelines in recent months seeking out bargains on office buildings, particularly in the Plaza District where demand from tenants has created a hot market for available office space.\nSL Green moved quickly on the tower once it hit the market and preempted other bids, according to a source familiar.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and Blackstone could not be immediately reached for comment. An Eastdil Secured team led by Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the sale.\nThe largest tenant is PineBridge Investments, the asset manager acquired last year by MetLife for $1.2 billion, which occupies about 75,000 square feet. Other major tenants include the investment bank BTIG, the venture capital firm Raine Group and a division of the Creative Artists Agency.\n\nBlackstone bought the building for\n$750 million\nin 2014 from Shorenstein Properties.\nIt was actually the second time the company owned the property. It had originally acquired the tower in 2007 as part of its takeover of Sam Zell\u2019s Equity Office Properties, and then quickly flipped the building and six others to Harry Macklowe.\nMacklowe lost the property to his lender, Deutsche Bank, which sold it and another office building (850 Third Avenue) for $930 million to Shorenstein in 2008.\nAfter two major tenants left in 2016, Blackstone spent about $170 million to renovate the building, including a new lobby, mechanical updates and converting the basement into an amenity space.\nThe private equity firm had put the building up for sale in 2019, eyeing a price tag of\n$800 million\n, but no final deal materialized. It refinanced the property last year with a\n$309 million\nCMBS loan originated by Morgan Stanley.\nSL Green, meanwhile, has been active in the market looking for deals. The company last month went into contract to buy the former Brooks Brothers building on Madison Avenue, where it plans to build its next ground-up office tower. It was also recently in the bidding for Paramount Group, and expressed interest in acquiring the Chrysler Building.\n",

        "content": "Crescent Heights scored a $238.4 million refinancing for the luxury 588-unit Forma Miami apartment tower in Edgewater.\nThe deal marks a continuing lending flurry in South Florida, despite elevated interest rates.\nCrescent Heights \u2013\u2013 led by Russell Galbut, Sonny Kahn and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 completed the 40-story Forma at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami last year, according to records. It includes 85,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities and a 50,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market.\nThe fixed-rate refinancing was provided via Freddie Mac\u2019s Lease-up program, according to a Walker &amp; Dunlop news release. Aaron Appel and Jonathan Schwartz were part of the Walker &amp; Dunlop team that represented Crescent Heights.\nThe Freddie Mac Lease-up program targets multifamily properties that are approaching stabilization, but haven\u2019t achieved it yet. Generally, more than 90 percent of units have to be leased for a property to be considered stabilized.\nForma is already stabilized, but wasn\u2019t when it initially applied for the refinancing, according to Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Michael Stepniewski, who also represented Crescent Heights.\nGalbut said the tower is 97 percent leased.\n\nDesigned by Rockwell Group and Arquitectonica, Forma offers studios and one- to three-bedroom units with condo level finishes, the Walker &amp; Dunlop news release says.\nApartments.com\nshows monthly rents range from $3,080 to $7,515.\nCrescent Heights owns 9 acres of properties next to Forma that it plans to develop into a city center, the release says.\nIn other recent refinancings, Treo Group scored\n$132 million\nthis month for its two-building Vox I and II student housing campus with 262 units, combined, at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue in South Miami. Midtown Capital scored a\n$57 million\nbridge loan last month for its 230-unit Astor Sound apartment complex that it\u2019s developing at 2253 Keast Lane in Lake Worth Beach.\nIn August, Acre landed\n$72 million\nto refinance its 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay at 6445 Northeast Seventh Avenue in Miami\u2019s MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market is experiencing a supply overhang following a construction boom. A pandemic-era influx of out-of-staters fueled unprecedented demand and record rent growth, prompting developers to jump on new projects. Last year, they completed a record\n18,600 apartments\nin South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. This led to lower rents and more concessions.\nDevelopers still are starting new projects, arguing that by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027, demand will be restored.\nOak Row Equities is developing the 324-unit\n2900 Terrace\non the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. In the Miami Design District, Miami Design District Associates, which includes Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, Hunter Pasteur and The Forbes Company, scored a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan in June for the 107-unit Cassi apartment project at 91-93 Northeast 36th Street.\n",

        "content": "A Kenilworth home a few blocks from the beach approached the high watermark for non-lakefront sales in the village, days after another property\nset a likely record\nfor inland sales in Kenilworth.\nThe house at 207 Cumberland Avenue sold for $5.9 million Tuesday, according to a social media post from listing agent Jena Radnay. The nine bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom house is situated a short walk from the beach on the north end of Kenilworth. It spans 9,600 square feet and sits on a 0.76-acre lot.\nThe price pencils out to $615 per square foot.\nThe sale followed a $6.1 million deal last week for a gutted and modernized historic house on Kenilworth Road. That transaction, brokered by @properties\u2019 John Mawicke, appears to be the most-expensive non-lakefront home sale in the village in several years, and the Cumberland Avenue property is not far behind.\nIt went under contract a little more than a month after it was listed in July, reflecting high demand for luxury housing in the North Shore, even outside the top-tier lakefront properties.\n\u201cIt just shows you that the values are very high for a 3,000-resident village,\u201d Radnay told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRadnay, an @properties agent and major broker for North Shore lakefront properties, said she\u2019s seeing interest from buyers in Chicago and out of town who want to move to the North Shore. With inventory in such short supply, buyers are turning their attention from the most-expensive cities like Winnetka and bringing more competition into Kenilworth.\nThe Cumberland Avenue house last sold in 2013 for $4.2 million. The house was owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity, but property tax bills were addressed to Jason Hanold, according to public records, which indicate the previous owners paid $74,000 in property taxes in 2023.\n\nThe property was listed in July for $6.5 million. Sale records that might identify the buyers are not yet available.\nRadnay has another Kenilworth listing, a lakeshore property on Sheridan Road,\nasking $15 million that is under contract\n. That asking price would break the village record for a lakefront property of $11.75 million set in 2020, but the final sale price is not yet known. Radnay said she expects the deal to close by the end of the year.\nIn September, a lakefront Kenilworth mansion that was expected to be a teardown\nsold for $6.8 million\nto developer Leo Birov of Heritage Luxury Homes. Birov is\nmarketing a $6 million spec\nmansion on part of the site, and it\u2019s likely another new construction is in the works for the other portion of the property.\nThe recent sales show the hot streak for North Shore luxury properties isn\u2019t slowing down.\nA few dozen homes have sold for more than $4 million along the North Shore this year,\nwith Winnetka leading the pack in luxury deals\n. A 13,900 square-foot mansion previously owned by a former Goldman Sachs executive \u2014 also listed by Radnay \u2014\nsold in September for $31.3 million\n, the highest Chicagoland home resale price ever recorded.\nThe lack of inventory is driving competition, Radnay said.\nLike the house on Cumberland Avenue, many luxury properties that recently sold or have pending contracts in the North Shore have gone under contract in a matter of weeks, in some cases within a few days.\n\u201cUntil our inventory changes, we\u2019re going to be staying at this exact same temperature for a while,\u201d Radnay said.\n",

Modular construction methods and proximity to energy sources are meant to cut costs and speed delivery; a 2-gigawatt build would normally cost about $16 billion, not counting Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips.\nPoolside is also in a $2 billion fundraising round that would value the company at $14 billion, up from $3 billion last year.

The deal marks the end of a troubled chapter for KPG, which had ambitious plans to convert the aging, seven-story building into a boutique Class A office and retail property.\nKPG signed the long-term ground lease with the owner, The Salvation Army, in 2021 for $22.1 million, and a year later secured a $34.5 million construction loan from Thorofare for an overhaul estimated to cost $55 million.\nThe redevelopment of the property, once dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s ugliest building,\u201d called for demolition of the front and rear facades, along with the addition of new steel structures. The project was nearing completion but had yet to receive a new certificate of occupancy, according to\nPincusCo\n, which first reported on the acquisition.\n\nThe building, located between Sixth and Seventh avenues, was marketed earlier this year by a JLL team with an asking price of roughly $50 million. But financial strain soon followed. In June, the Salvation Army filed a nonpayment case in Manhattan housing court, alleging KPG had failed to pay two quarters\u2019 worth of ground rent totaling $162,500. The court issued a default judgment in favor of the Salvation Army in August, paving the way for Thorofare to step in.\nThe lender\u2019s move to assume control is a familiar one in today\u2019s tightening office market, where rising interest rates and leasing headwinds have squeezed even well-capitalized developers. KPG, led by\nGregory Kraut\nand Rod Kritsberg, bet on the NYC office market as other landlords began defaulting and handing over keys.\nKPG sought to convert aging Class B and Class C buildings into high-end boutique offices. It focused on areas such as Soho, Tribeca and Greenwich Village, where office supply is limited. But the firm has faced mounting challenges as demand for new office space remains uneven across the city.\nRepresentatives for Thorofare and KPG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Keith Kurland and Michael Diaz with Walker &amp; Dunlap arranged the refinancing on Terra\u2019s behalf.\nThe mortgage replaces a $127 million loan provided by an affiliate of MF1 Capital last year, the statement said.\nIn 2023, Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\n, led by David Martin, and Miami-based New Valley, led by Howard Lober, completed Natura Gardens, a garden-style complex that consists of 12 three-story buildings, records show. The project offers a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments ranging from 727 square feet to 1,476 square feet. Monthly rents range from $2,125 to $4,851, according to Apartments.com.\n\nIn 2021, the joint venture secured a\n$64.8 million\nconstruction loan from Bank OZK to build Natura Gardens. Terra and New Valley had originally planned a much larger mixed-use development for the 72-acre site they acquired for $52 million from Prologis in 2019.\nIn 2021, before construction began on Natura Gardens, Terra and New Valley sold 45 acres for $53.5 million to Butters Group and Greystar, which are planning 500,000 square feet of industrial space and a 360-unit multifamily community.\nThe Natura Gardens refinancing follows a series of major loan closings across Terra\u2019s portfolio. In January, the firm secured a\n$291 million\nloan for its CentroCity, a mixed-use development with 470 apartments in Miami. Last year, Terra and Grass River obtained a\n$245 million\nrefinancing for their Grove Central mixed-use project in Coconut Grove.\nRecently, Terra offered to purchase and overhaul the 70-year-old Miami Seaquarium on Virginia Key into a modern, marine life\u2013free aquarium and education campus. The planned\n$22.5 million\nacquisition will preserve the site\u2019s signature dome and add new retail, dining, a marina and green public spaces.\nThe deal has to clear a couple of hurdles. First, a bankruptcy judge in Delaware has to sign off on the sale of the lease and is expected to rule on it on Friday. Should the judge approve the transfer, Terra would also need to obtain final approval from Miami-Dade County, which owns the land underneath Miami Seaquarium.",

        "content": "A proptech startup has entered the chat on private listings, offering a possible alternative to pocket listings in the Texas luxury market.\nAs real estate heavy hitters Compass, Zillow and the National Association of Realtors duke it out over the legality of private listings, Dayton, Ohio-based Unlisted has created a product that turns the whisper network of off-market listings into an app.\nThe Waitlist is a platform that lets homeowners gauge buyer interest before listing. The web app, which will eventually be available on iOS as well, lets window shoppers express interest in homes before their owners are ready to sell. Homeowners can respond to users on their waitlist, and its profit model sells real estate agents the chance to own zip codes on its website.\nThe goal is to create Waitlist profiles for every home in the country, using property descriptions generated automatically and public record data purchased from ATTOM. Since the app launched on June 18, 7,000 homes, worth an estimated $5 billion, have generated waitlists.\nReal estate agents can buy zip codes in the Unlisted system, assuming the title of Local Expert and attaching their information to every home profile in the area. Only one agent is selected per zip code, and most of them so far are Sotheby\u2019s International Realty professionals.\nJB Hayes, a Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s agent who\u2019s bought five zip codes throughout Dallas, is betting on Unlisted to become a springboard for off-market transactions.\n\u201cBefore, people would share off-markets with their colleagues that are in other brokerages, or people they\u2019ve done deals with, but that\u2019s illegal marketing now,\u201d Hayes said.\nShe\u2019s referring to the nationwide dispute over the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy, a rule that requires listing agents to put a property on the local MLS within one day of marketing it for sale. Zillow has lent its considerable muscle to enforcing the rule,\ninterpreting yard signs and social media posts as public marketing\n.\nNAR and Zillow are challenging Compass, which has pioneered private exclusive listings on a systematic scale. In addition, Compass has inspired firms like\nDouglas Elliman, Corcoran\nand\nColdwell Banker\nto prove NAR\u2019s rule.\n\nBut Unlisted founder Katie Hill insists The Waitlist isn\u2019t a shopping platform, and it isn\u2019t meant to facilitate off-market sales.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the vision right now. We want to be a readiness site, not a listing site,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe entire industry as we know it competes in listings; nobody competes in folks who are not for sale.\u201d\nEffective November, homeowners on the site can authorize agents to update their property profiles.\nThe app could be particularly useful in Austin, where high property taxes and no mandatory sales price disclosure generate a strong preference for privacy among luxury buyers and sellers for whom it\u2019s more profitable to avoid a flashy price tag.\nBecause private sales keep local appraisers in the dark about the true price of a property,\nit\u2019s all but conventional for homes above $10 million to avoid the Austin MLS altogether\n, according to Jeanne and Julie Residential Group, an Austin luxury team.\n\u201cAustin is an anomaly. California puts everything on MLS, everything. And Dallas and Houston put pretty much everything on MLS. So Austin\u2019s really kind of an anomaly in the country,\u201d Jeanne Parker said.\nA dwindling buyer pool in Austin is driving more Austin ultra-luxury sellers to the open market this year, according to the team. However, as long as there are wealthy buyers and sellers who want privacy more than a top-dollar offer, there will be a demand for private listings.\n\u201cPeople get the most exposure when you promote and market and list. That is definitely the best way to go, because you\u2019re going to drive up the price, and there\u2019s more people that are going to get their eyeballs on it. There are some people that just don\u2019t care,\u201d Hayes said.\n\u201cThey get the price they want, they\u2019re going to be happy. So why go through all the hoops to make the house show-ready?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A pair of creekside medical office buildings in Marin County sold for more than $24 million last month, according to public records.\nBay Area-based Wareham Development Corporation sold the two offices at 2 and 18 Bon Air Road in Larkspur to Anchor Health Properties, a Charlottesville, Virginia-based real estate investment trust, for $24.1 million.\nMarinHealth leases both buildings for specialty outpatient services. At a combined 27,300 square feet, they fit into a larger constellation of medical offices in the area, which includes a regional hospital. Marin Health is under lease until 2031.\nSan Rafael-based Wareham Development, which is known for its focus in developing life science buildings, had owned the properties for decades.\nThe building at 2 Bon Air Road was once a Safeway grocery store, which Wareham renovated into a large medical office in 1991.\nThe second building, across a parking lot at 18 Bon Air Road, had been a fast food restaurant before Wareham\u2019s redevelopment into an outpatient facility in 2004.\nCaroline Reynolds of JLL said the $881-per-square-foot price was high but ultimately incomparable to other North Bay office sales as the buildings represent \u201chighly specialized\u201d outpatient facilities.\nA source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the location had much to do with Wareham\u2019s motivation to sell.\n\nStarted by Rich Robbins in 1977, Wareham Development\u2019s portfolio dots the Bay Area, but the main hub sits in the East Bay, with large research campuses in Berkeley and Emeryville. The source said Marin County, where Wareham has one other property, stretched the company\u2019s orbit too far.\nWareham Development partner James Goddard said the sale would provide revenue to reinvest into the firm\u2019s other Bay Area campuses.\n\u201cThis was an asset that we had owned for many decades. As our portfolio has grown and expanded, it became a geographically isolated project,\u201d Goddard said. \u201cNow was an opportune time to sell and reinvest the funds into our large format campus locations in the East Bay and in the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto.\u201d\nThe company\nmade headlines\nin February when it announced plans to sell Berkeley\u2019s historic Fantasy Studios.\nKnown as \u201cThe House that Creedence Built,\u201d the more than 121,000-square-foot complex had hosted recording studios where bands such Creedence Clearwater Revival, Santana, Joan Baez and Green Day all cut records. The studios closed in 2018.\nRobbins, who owned the buildings since 2007, had planned to turn the property into a life sciences research lab, but ditched those plans.\nAnchor Health Properties did not return requests for comment. The Virginia-based company owns and manages 150 healthcare facilities across the country, including a maternal care facility in Burlingame, leased by Sutter Health.\n",

        "content": "The owner of one of Houston\u2019s most recognizable skyscrapers has filed for bankruptcy, marking the latest setback for downtown\u2019s long-stalled revival.\nBell Business Investments, the owner of the 45-story ExxonMobil tower at 800 Bell Street, filed for Chapter 11 protection last week after its residential conversion plans collapsed and its lender moved to foreclose, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe 1.2 million-square-foot building \u2014 once the headquarters of Humble Oil, a predecessor to\nExxonMobil\n\u2014 has been vacant since\nExxon\nleft for its Spring campus in 2015.\nThe borrower, managed by Brooklyn developer\nIsaac Jacobowitz of Carnegie Management\n, acquired the property from San Francisco-based\nShorenstein Properties\nin early 2023 through an affiliate, reportedly paying half the $50 million Shorenstein spent on it a decade earlier.\nThe 2023 purchase included a $14.5 million loan from Shorenstein, and the debt was sold at a discount in April to a Nevada entity, 800 Bell Holdings LLC. That entity sued to foreclose, accusing Jacobowitz\u2019s firm of blocking access to the property, neglecting maintenance, and failing to share financial records.\nThe landlord disputes the allegations, calling them \u201cbogus non-monetary defaults\u201d and claiming the lender turned aggressive soon after acquiring the note. While property taxes have since been paid, the lender\u2019s attorney, Houston-based Sanford Dow, said the building is in disrepair, citing broken windows and water damage.\n\n\u201cBBI had a sweetheart deal and couldn\u2019t get out of their own way,\u201d Dow said in an email to the outlet, describing the bankruptcy as an effort to stall foreclosure.\nThe bankruptcy filing temporarily halted foreclosure proceedings and a separate lawsuit while the court considers next steps. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13. In court documents, the landlord said it has a contract to sell the building for $35 million, with closing set for this Friday \u2014 a deal that would require court approval.\nOnce envisioned as a marquee residential conversion that could anchor downtown Houston\u2019s post-pandemic rebound, 800 Bell is now emblematic of the city\u2019s office-to-housing struggle.\nThe 1962 tower \u2014 briefly the tallest west of the Mississippi \u2014 was added to the National Register of Historic Places this year \u2014 a designation that could aid future redevelopment but hasn\u2019t yet saved it from financial freefall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After\nMerchants Bank\nmade loans to a group of troubled investors, the scope of its losses is coming into view, as companies tied to one of their borrowers, imprisoned investor Moshe Silber, go through bankruptcy.\nThe Carmel, Indiana-based regional bank, which became a go-to lender for multifamily landlords across the U.S.,\nannounced\nlast quarter that some of its borrowers were under investigation for mortgage fraud, leading to $46.1 million in write-downs.\nNew court filings reveal the bank\u2019s exposure to Moshe Silber, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison. In Silber and his co-conspirators scheme, they allegedly used a stolen identity to obtain an inflated\n$74 million loan\non a Cincinnati apartment complex.\nThe investigation into Silber was part of a broader effort by the Department of Justice and the Federal Home Finance Agency to weed out commercial mortgage fraud.\nMerchants Bank provided loans to at least seven of Silber\u2019s multifamily properties. Merchants claims it is owed over $61 million on the loans backed by properties in Flint, Michigan; Danville, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nMerchants claims in court filings the Silber-linked entities abandoned the properties in 2024, leading the bank to cover the operating shortfalls at the properties. Merchants then appointed receivers who put the properties up for sale. The properties have either received letters of intent from buyers or are under contract to be sold.\nThe proposed sale prices suggest Merchants will take large losses.\nNotably, Merchants claims it has a binding letter of intent to sell the 365-unit Midway Townhomes in Flint, Michigan, for just $1.5 million, according to court filings. It\u2019s unclear how much Silber paid for the property, but in 2023, Merchants provided a $21.6 million loan on it, and the new sale price would mark a 93 percent decrease from the loan.\nOther Silber-linked properties had higher offers, but they were still below the underlying loans on the property. The Woodside Village in Dannville, Virginia, which was recently hit by 17 building code violations by the city, had a sale in place for $10 million, according to Merchants\u2019 court filings. Merchants initially provided $10.5 million in loans on the multifamily property.\nBut final prices could be even lower.\n\nBecause of the bankruptcy, Merchants alleges a buyer could swoop in with debtor-in-possession financing and a stalking horse bid and pay even less. Merchants alleges the debtor\u2019s proposed use of $22 million in DIP financing, or a loan to sustain operations during the bankruptcy process, is giving the DIP lender an unfair advantage. The DIP financing will be provided by an affiliate of entrepreneur Daryl Hagler, who Merchants claims will have credit-bid rights. In other words, the DIP lender could buy the properties using its existing debt for less than what Merchants would obtain in its ongoing sales process of the properties.\nIt is clear that Merchants is expecting to take a hit on the Silber portfolio. But it is unclear how those losses will appear on its balance sheet.\nAt least some of Silber\u2019s loans appear to be securitized as part of a larger private securitization, according to Merchants\u2019 legal filings. Merchants has completed billions of dollars of private securitizations. The bank claims these vehicles minimize its risk by offloading loans to outside investors and allowing the bank to lend more. Usually, however, a bank has to assume the loan if a borrower commits fraud.\nMerchants\u2019 latest court filings are part of a larger bankruptcy related to Silber\u2019s former companies CBRM and Crown Capital. After Silber pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, a fiduciary was appointed to oversee his multifamily portfolio. San Antonio-based Lynd Group was tapped to manage the properties.\nThe fiduciary put CBRM and Crown Capital into bankruptcy in May after a creditor sought to sell CBRM, a company controlling over 6,000 multifamily units, at an auction in Rockland County.\nThat\u2019s when the troubled financial picture of Silber\u2019s portfolio emerged. An attorney for CBRM claimed Silber could have extracted hundreds of millions from his properties for his own benefit, since the company Crown Capital had secured $200 million in bond financing in addition to $450 million in property-level mortgages. Many of Silber\u2019s properties were in disrepair at the time of the bankruptcy.\nEarlier this month, the fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, put additional 42 companies tied to 19 properties owned by Silber into bankruptcy.\nMerchants, which is the senior lender on seven of the 19 properties, pushed back on the bankruptcy.\nA spokesperson for Merchants declined to comment.\n",

The property was recently appraised at 21 percent less than it was in 2019.\nThe Plaza District building, located between East 59th and 60th Streets, is a 28-story office and retail building totaling 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by a group of investors \u2014 including Vornado, Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System \u2014 in 2013 for about $1.3 billion.\nThe owners secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy have both taken a hit since then. Occupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued. But Ralph Lauren, which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building,\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\nnow paying\nabout 30 percent less in rent. Occupancy dipped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is now back up to 74 percent.\nBeyond Ralph Lauren, current office tenants include Lakewood Capital, according to Vornado\u2019s website, with retail space occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\n\nRevenue last year was $69.9 million, down from $87.3 million in 2019.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property also saw its value fall. Once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nThe loan was transferred to special servicing after the borrower failed to fund a \u201cwaterfall shortfall,\u201d a type of investment distribution. The borrower formally requested the transfer, according to information from the lender provided by Morningstar.\nThe lender said it\u2019s in discussions with the borrower and evaluating all available legal and resolution options, including a loan sale and foreclosure. A pre-negotiation agreement has already been signed.\nVornado did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "We are all pro-housing here, ok?\nWhenever someone says they know New York City needs more housing, wait for the \u201cbut.\u201d\nConsider the\nlawsuit\nbrought by members of the City Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus last month. The complaint argued that while the members don\u2019t oppose increasing the city\u2019s housing stock, three measures that will appear on the\nNovember ballot\n\u2014 aimed at streamlining housing construction \u2014 mislead voters.\nState Supreme Court Judge Jeffrey Pearlman on Wednesday denied the group\u2019s petition, which asked the court to void the questions until an environmental review of the potential impact of the proposals is completed. The Common Sense Caucus plans to appeal the decision, an attorney confirmed.\nCity Council leaders have separately argued that the ballot questions are deceptive and dangerous. And when they talk about the measures, they invariably emphasize that their opposition to the proposals isn\u2019t an objection to ramping up housing construction.\n\u201cYes, we know we have to build housing, but what about investing in our schools? What about investing in our parks, the streets, the roads? What about adding economic opportunity?\u201d Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises, said at a rally last week. \u201cThis gives us the opportunity to negotiate with those coming in our community for the things that we need in our community to grow.\u201d\nThe City Council\u2019s \u201cbut\u201d is that the ballot proposals strip away members\u2019 ability to fight for funding and other benefits for their communities. The Council is effectively the last stop and most consequential part of the city\u2019s land use review process. The body tends to vote according to the wishes of the local Council member, giving that member leverage to squeeze concessions out of developers, funding out of the administration and guarantees that a project will be built using union labor.\nOn Wednesday, Comptroller Brad Lander, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine spoke at a rally to support the ballot measures. (Lander spoke for only a few seconds before climate protestors emerged from the crowd behind him with signs reading \u201cBlackRock Brad\u201d and \u201cKeep Your Word.\u201d The protestors have\nshown up\nat other events, calling on Lander to divest the city\u2019s funds from BlackRock.)\nReynoso acknowledged that when he was a Council member, he loved member deference, the tradition of the City Council deferring to the local member on land use matters. But he said some City Council members have lost their seats for supporting affordable housing projects. (He was perhaps alluding to Marjorie Vel\u00e1zquez, who\nlost her reelection bid\nafter supporting a Throggs Neck project.) Reynoso said this threat should be removed from members\u2019 calculus when considering affordable housing in their districts.\n\u201cMany Council members don\u2019t take the risk at all. They build no housing, especially affordable housing, in an effort to preserve their seat in the City Council,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other members that put their necks on the line and support housing and don\u2019t get kicked out of their seats, but we shouldn\u2019t leave this up to chance. We shouldn\u2019t make this risky.\u201d\nAmit Singh Bagga, who is leading YES on Affordable Housing, a campaign that plans to spend $3 million on promoting the ballot questions, said that the current City Council has been approving housing at a faster pace than its predecessors. But that doesn\u2019t mean future Councils will follow suit.\n\u201cWe cannot rely on just one good speaker \u2026 to solve a structural problem that\u2019s been decades in the making,\u201d he said at Wednesday\u2019s rally.\nLast week, the City Council advanced the rezoning of Jamaica, Queens, which is projected to pave the way for nearly 12,000 new housing units in the district. As part of the Council\u2019s deal with the administration on the rezoning, City Hall\ncommitted\nto providing more than $400 million in funding for infrastructure and other improvements in the neighborhood.\nAt the time, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams pointed to the additional investments as another example of what is at stake in the fight over the ballot measures.\n\u201cWe have not only approved housing, but this Council has improved initial proposals by deepening the affordability of the homes that they will create while securing major investments for our neighborhoods,\u201d she said.\nBut the approval also shaved nearly 500 units from housing projections, because allowable density in some parts of the rezoning area was reduced and some areas were removed from the rezoning entirely. Council members explained that the changes were aimed at creating a smoother transition from higher-density downtown to the occupied homes to the south.\nCrain\u2019s reports that the Council has also been distributing talking points to community boards, emphasizing the danger to single- and two-family homes posed by the ballot questions. The thinking goes that the measures will make it easier for multifamily buildings to be constructed in areas dominated by single- and two-family homes. The PowerPoint distributed to the community boards, per Crain\u2019s, indicates that one of the ballot questions \u201ceffectively eliminates 1- and 2-family home zoning in NYC.\u201d (The ballot questions do not, on their own, change zoning.)\n\nSuch concerns were also prevalent among opponents to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. Before passing the text amendment, the City Council made\nchanges\nthat largely excluded such neighborhoods from transit-oriented and town center development.\nIt is an interesting thought experiment to imagine what the conversations about these measures would have been had they taken place 10 years ago. For one thing, the preamble to criticism would not be: \u201cOf course to solve the housing crisis we need more housing.\u201d\nI doubt, though, many would object to question 5, which asks if the city should drag the city map into the 21st Century.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nYonkers Mayor Mike Spano is calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to investigate the reasons MGM Resorts dropped its bid for a casino license for its facility in the city. In a post on Instagram, Spano said the decision to pull out of the competition \u201cdefies all logic\u201d and is \u201cnothing short of a betrayal to the people of Yonkers and Westchester County.\u201d He also pointed to the fact that President Donald Trump stands to benefit from Bally\u2019s receiving a license for its golf course in the Bronx. As part of its agreement to take over the golf course lease from Trump, Bally\u2019s agreed to pay Trump $115 million if it snags one of the casino licenses. Why did MGM drop its plans for a full-fledged casino at its Yonkers facility, and can the existing slot parlor survive without a license? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA 2022 study found that Hart Island, a 101-acre public cemetery in Pelham Bay between the Bronx and Long Island, will run out of suitable burial space in eight to 12 years. City Council committees are holding a joint oversight hearing on the island\u2019s future on Thursday.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman gave $1 million to Defend NYC, an anti-Zohran Mamdani super PAC,\nPolitico New York reports\n. Ackman previously gave Fix the City, a super PAC backing Andrew Cuomo, $500,000.\n\u2014 While three candidates vie for the top job at City Hall, Mayor Eric Adams says he has his pick of three \u201cdream jobs.\u201d During an appearance on \u201cThe Reset Talk Show,\u201d Adams said he\u2019s looking at three job offers, according to\nthe New York Daily News\n.\n\u2014 Even legalese needs a human touch. A state judge on Wednesday slammed residents of public housing in Chelsea for filing a lawsuit using AI,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. The lawsuit, which is seeking to prevent the city from demolishing the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea houses, was written by the AI chatbot Grok and cited legal filings that don\u2019t exist. The judge called the lawsuit \u201cgarbage\u201d and threatened to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice. The residents have since hired an attorney, who said his clients were \u201cunfamiliar with the dangers\u201d of relying on AI.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$8.5 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 330 West 88th Street on the Upper West Side. Jaime Richichi with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$510 million\nfor a 10-story commercial building at 1334 York Avenue in Lenox Hill. Sotheby\u2019s sold its New York headquarters to Cornell University.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$24 million\nfor a 10-room co-op at The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side. John Burger with Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Howard Hanna has officially planted its flag in Manhattan.\nOne of the nation\u2019s largest brokerages announced on Thursday that it acquired Elegran Real Estate, the 17-year-old firm founded by CEO Michael Rossi. Under its new ownership, the company, headquartered in Midtown, will be referred to as Howard Hanna Elegran.\nHoward Hanna has been expanding in the outer boroughs and New York City suburbs in recent years as it evaluated opportunities to set up shop in Manhattan, according to Howard Hanna CEO Hoby Hanna.\nElegran \u2014 which placed 15th in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the top brokerages in Manhattan with $118 million in sales \u2014 was \u201ca great company to give us entr\u00e9e and use as a springboard,\u201d said Hanna.\nHanna added that he and Rossi had discussed joining forces a few years ago, but the \u201ctiming wasn\u2019t right for either of us.\u201d Rossi then circled back in the spring, \u201cand here we are today,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson for Elegran declined to share additional details about the acquisition, including the purchase price, citing a confidential agreement.\nThe company\u2019s existing New York City offices include a location in the Bronx and in Queens. Howard Hanna acquired a Long Island-based firm, Coach Realtors, in 2023, and under their combined umbrella, expanded to Astoria through the acquisition of Marquee Realty.\nElegran\u2019s 157 agents will join Howard Hanna\u2019s network of 3,500 agents across the tri-state area. The firm launched operations in New York state a decade ago and has since become its largest in agent headcount and number of transactions, according to a press release.\nRossi will remain on board with the company as an executive vice president with a focus on growth and development in New York City. He\u2019ll be working alongside Matt Rand, the firm\u2019s regional president.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough, post-class action lawsuits and the FARE Act, to be an independent firm and thrive in this market,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nHe added that the \u201ctiming was perfect\u201d considering the wave of consolidation in the industry, which hit a peak last month when Compass and Anywhere Real Estate announced a\nseismic merger deal\nexpected to close next year.\n\u201cI wish I knew that the Compass news was happening,\u201d Rossi said.\u201dThat would have made me the smartest guy in the world.\u201d\nBoth Rossi and Hanna billed increased consolidation as an advantage for the privately-held company, which Hanna described as \u201cnimble\u201d and a \u201cgood attraction point for agents and brokerages that are looking for that flexibility, as opposed to big corporate philosophies.\u201d\n\u201cThe consumer really needs a choice,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Pepsi and Coke in the refrigerator.\u201d\nNews of the acquisition comes after Elegran ended its licensing agreement with Forbes Global Properties earlier this year, sparking rumors of a potential takeover that eventually pegged Howard Hanna as the likely frontrunner months ahead of the official announcement.\nRossi confirmed through a spokesperson in June that the brokerage was no longer part of the Forbes network and that it was working on a \u201cnew collaboration,\u201d though he declined to share more details at the time.\nRossi said the \u201cwhispering\u201d was because \u201cwe kept agents abreast of the conversations we were having and the direction we were thinking of going.\u201d\nSeveral agents have left Elegran over the last few months, including its managing director Jared Antin, who joined Brown Harris Stevens as an executive director in July. The following month, two other teams, the Asset Advisory Team and the Waterview Advisory Group, also left Elegran to join Coldwell Banker Warburg.\nNews of the agents\u2019 departure \u201cmade it seem like we lost a lot of people,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve only lost three revenue-generating agents who were incentivized to bring over non-producing agents to Coldwell Banker.\u201d\n\u201cDuring a time of transition, our retention has been industry standard,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cActually, given the transition, our retention\u2019s been incredible. No one likes change.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 push for a\ntaxpayer-assisted stadium\nin Arlington Heights is running into sustained headwinds in Springfield.\nA proposal from state Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, would require public review, economic reporting and potential repayment of subsidies for any major stadium deal \u2014 a move aimed squarely at the Bears\u2019 $5 billion plan for a domed stadium and mixed-use campus on the site of the former Arlington International Racecourse, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe measure would mandate that any local or state agreement offering financial incentives for a professional sports venue be posted publicly for 30 days, followed by at least two public hearings and an independent cost-benefit study from the state\u2019s Commission on Government Forecasting &amp; Accountability.\nThe Bears would need to file annual reports on job creation and tax revenue, and if they relocate before the deal expires, they\u2019d have to repay subsidies with interest and make local schools, libraries and public safety agencies whole for lost property-tax revenue.\nBuckner, one of the Bears\u2019 most vocal critics in the legislature, said his proposal is designed to prevent fast-tracked stadium legislation.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to change the way we do stadium financing in this state for the long term,\u201d Buckner told the outlet.\nThe Bears are lobbying lawmakers during the General Assembly\u2019s fall veto session for approval to negotiate a long-term property tax break via \u201cmega project\u201d legislation.\n\nThat plan would allow developers investing at least $500 million to freeze property taxes for decades, paying instead through negotiated payments in lieu of taxes. The team argues such certainty is vital as construction costs rise by roughly $10 million a month.\nDespite pledging to privately finance the stadium, the team has sought roughly\n$855 million\nin infrastructure support for roads, transit and utilities connecting the 326-acre site to surrounding suburbs.\nThe proposal has drawn little enthusiasm in Springfield, where Governor JB Pritzker has said the Bears should pay the\n$534 million\nstill owed on Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation before seeking new public assistance.\nBuckner conceded his bill is unlikely to pass during this veto session but said he hopes it sparks a broader debate about accountability in public-private stadium deals.\n\u201cTeams pit\ncities\nand states against each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make a deal today, then a decade later, they leave \u2014 and taxpayers are left holding the bag.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Imagine if after legalizing marijuana, lawmakers had learned that no new people had started smoking it. Would they have been disappointed? Would they have scheduled a hearing to figure out how to get more people stoned?\nThis is happening with rent stabilization.\nExcept in Kingston, price controls for apartments have not been adopted upstate, six years after the state legislature made that possible. This has upset Assembly members who love rent stabilization, especially Sarahana Shrestha and Linda Rosenthal.\nTo find out why, Rosenthal has\nscheduled a hearing\n, the Times Union reported.\nI\u2019m not here to tell you rent control is all bad. Like cannabis, it has benefits and drawbacks. My opinion, and that of nearly all economists, is that the drawbacks of price controls for housing outweigh the benefits \u2014 by a lot.\nFor that reason, rent control began in New York City as a temporary measure to be dropped when the city\u2019s housing emergency \u2014 defined as a sub-5 percent vacancy rate \u2014 was over.\nUnfortunately, it proved to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The policy\u2019s winners became such a powerful constituency that politicians perpetuated the housing emergency rather than end it by allowing lots of new housing. Ever since, the winners (tenants in nice, low-rent units) have been prospering at the expense of the losers (everyone else).\nBut upstate localities just haven\u2019t been able to get their housing emergencies started. Hence, no rent stabilization. Bummer!\nIt must suck to live without a housing emergency. Every time you need to find a new place, there are enough rentals available that landlords have to compete for your business. Terrible, I know.\n\nCompare that to New York City, where the vacancy rate was last measured at a minuscule 1.4 percent \u2014 a triumph of 50 years of rent stabilization. In the city, apartment hunting is a true challenge, as it should be.\nIt wouldn\u2019t seem right if New Yorkers could rent an apartment as easily as buying a TV, with manufacturers and retailers improving their efficiency, technology and economies of scale to offer the best features and prices.\nInstead, finding a low-rent unit means reading the obituaries, building a network of sources and sending gift baskets to rental brokers to find out before anyone else if a rent-stabilized unit is becoming available. Fail, and you pay through the nose.\nExcept in New York City, Kingston and Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties, all of which have rent stabilization (and high housing costs), New Yorkers are missing out on the excitement of finding that rare, inexpensive unit that comes with permanent lease renewals and succession rights.\nPerhaps the hearing that legislators are planning will yield some ways to make this happen.\nOne bill\n, which failed to pass last session, would create pathways to rent stabilization other than a low vacancy rate.\nGiven scarcity-inducing policies\u2019 success in making house-hunting a blood sport downstate, lawmakers could even apply them to areas beyond housing.\nFor example, they could ban jewelry stores and commercial mining. That way, New Yorkers seeking a wedding ring or anniversary gift would have to dig for gemstones or dive for pearl-bearing oysters.\nTeddy Roosevelt once said, \u201cNothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means\neffort, pain, difficulty\n.\u201d Affordable housing should be no exception.\n",

        "content": "Lawsuits, foreclosures, judgments, investigations \u2014 it\u2019s all finally caught up to Second Development Services founder Louis Greco.\nThe developer filed for personal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, Bisnow\nreported\n, estimating between $100 million and $500 million in liabilities against only $10 million to $50 million in assets. The bankruptcy case will be combined with an earlier one filed by Greco\u2019s wife, Linda.\nThe bankruptcy filing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. A company owned by Greco with common creditors and ownership also filed for bankruptcy.\n\u201cI am a real estate developer by profession and I have enjoyed great success and great failure,\u201d Greco wrote in the filing. \u201cCurrently, my failures are now overcomplicating my life and require bankruptcy intervention.\u201d\nTo help dig out of the hole, Greco and his wife plan to sell a handful of condominium units at a building in Brooklyn Heights with a combined estimated value of $14 million.\n\nGreco is also looking to dodge a judgment in a lawsuit regarding\na project\nat 232-40 Smith Street, where North Hill Capital Management won a $30 million award in 2023. Two days before Greco filed for bankruptcy, a court filing said the lender could seize a 50 percent stake in the property and the limited liability company Greco owns it through.\nNorth Hill is the only secured creditor in a group of nearly 100 total creditors, which includes former business partners, banks and government entities, including the IRS.\nDespite the financial malaise, Greco doesn\u2019t seem fazed, telling Bisnow that \u201ccurrent projects will not be affected\u201d and new projects will be pursued following reorganization. Greco claims to have developed more than 100 projects, including 1 Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Park.\nAmong Greco\u2019s myriad problems are a handful of lawsuits filed by residents of a six-story condo building in Clinton Hill, where Greco is accused of fraud, self-dealing and a failure to deliver on promises. The AG\u2019s office is\ninvestigating\nthe building and Silver Point Capital recently foreclosed on it after a $35 million loan default.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Resident Group scored a $113.8 million refinancing for its 279-unit Metro Edgewater apartment tower.\nThe deal marks a continuing lending boom in South Florida, despite elevated interest rates.\nMiami-based Resident Group \u2013\u2013 a partnership among Camino Capital Management, Lujeni, Korner and Building Block Realty \u2013\u2013 completed the 32-story tower at 452 Northeast 31st Street in Miami in 2023, according to records. The partners rebranded under Resident Group.\nThe refinancing is a Federal Housing Administration-insured loan secured through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a JLL news release. The FHA-backed loans generally have fixed interest rates and a term of 35 to 40 years.\nJesse Wright and Joshua Odessky of JLL represented Resident Group.\nThe loan refinanced a\n$115 million\nfloating-rate bridge loan Metro Edgewater\u2019s developers scored in 2023, shortly after they completed the tower.\nMetro Edgewater is 94 percent leased, according to Carlos Ortiz of Building Block Realty.\n\nMonthly rents range from $2,868 to $5,475, according to\nApartments.com\n. The Metro Edgewater website shows expenses can run higher due to pet fees, parking fees, internet services and common area/clubhouse deposits.\nCamino Capital, based in Washington, D.C., is a family office led by CEO No\u00ebl Bejarano, according to Bejarano\u2019s LinkedIn. Building Block Realty is a Miami-based real estate and development consulting firm led by Ortiz, according to its website. Ortiz is founder of concrete shell contractor Prodesa International and manages its investment fund through Building Block Realty. Lujeni is based in Miami\u00a0 and is led by Daniel Rincon, state corporate records show. Korner is a Colombian real estate development firm.\nThe developers plan the 28-story second\nMetro Tower II\nat 3055 Northeast Fourth Avenue, adjacent to Metro Edgewater. As of last year, the plan was for the second tower to consist of 103 apartments and 60 hotel keys.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market is experiencing a supply overhang due to a\nrecord 18,600 apartments\nlast year, outpacing the 15,000 net new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. This led to slower lease-ups and more concessions. A pandemic-era influx of out-of-staters prompted unprecedented demand and record rent growth, leading to the construction boom.\nIn other recent refinancings, Crescent Heights landed\n$238.4 million\nthis month for the 40-story, 588-unit Forma Miami luxury apartment tower at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Also this month, Treo Group scored a\n$132 million\nrefinancing for its Vox I and II student housing buildings with 262 units, combined, at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue in South Miami.\nIn August, Acre scored\n$72 million\nto refinance its 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay apartment building at 6445 Northeast Seventh Avenue in Miami\u2019s MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District.\n",

        "content": "Real estate business in Chicago\u2019s immigrant communities is becoming trickier as federal officials ramp up arrests with their crackdown in Chicago.\nFears around being targeted by immigration officials have created a cooling effect in Chicago\u2019s Hispanic and Latino communities, said Maria Kharot, president of Chicago\u2019s chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. The fear extends beyond just undocumented immigrants, she said.\n\u201cA lot of people are not wanting to purchase, not wanting to buy, and they\u2019re just afraid,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cNot that they\u2019re undocumented. They\u2019re scared because they feel like they\u2019ve been profiled in general, regardless of their immigration status.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it had\narrested more than 1,500 people\nacross Illinois\nas part of what it dubbed \u201cOperation Midway Blitz.\u201d President Donald Trump and his administration said authorities are targeting dangerous criminals in the operations. In a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the widespread immigration enforcement is making Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods safer.\n\u201cOur top enforcement priority is removing dangerous criminals from our streets, making our neighborhoods safer for everyone \u2014 including new potential home buyers,\u201d McLaughlin said.\nBut immigration activist groups have argued the arrests have been far broader, targeting day laborers, street vendors and people without criminal histories. The uncertainty has left many Chicago immigrants \u2014 both undocumented and those who have some legal protections \u2014 fearful that they could be swept up next, and that going through the process of buying or selling a home could raise unwanted scrutiny.\nMost undocumented immigrants in the U.S. live in mixed-status households, where a spouse, child or other family member has citizenship or lawful residence, according to 2024 Pew research. In other cases, immigrants have some documentation but may not be full permanent residents. They could be awaiting asylum hearings or other court dates to adjudicate their status.\n\u201cSometimes it may be one person in the household that is going through the process and they\u2019re waiting for their final approval. They don\u2019t want to risk it,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cThey\u2019re being intimidated.\u201d\nUnder the Trump administration, immigration officials have often asked an immigration judge to dismiss the case of asylum seekers at their court appearances, leaving them eligible for arrest and faster removal when they attend hearings.\nBrokers who work with Kharot\u2019s group have had clients pull out of the homebuying search or change their minds about selling because of concerns about the federal immigration crackdown, she said, and property showings in immigrant communities have dipped.\n\nFor brokers, the circumstances make the normally routine process of filing paperwork a trickier task, Kharot said. Non-citizens buying or selling homes often use different processes than citizens, so brokers need to know citizenship status to move the transaction along. Clients without legal status may be worried about offering that information.\n\u201cWe need to ask whether they are a citizen, what their immigration status is, but we have to build that level of trust,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t ask that, we\u2019re not giving our clients the right service level.\u201d\nBeyond buying and selling real estate, the immigration crackdown has also impacted the labor market when it comes to construction and home contracting, Kharot said. She said an investor she\u2019s worked with had to put rehab projects on hold because their construction workers did not feel safe working on the site. About one-in-five construction workers in Chicago are foreign-born noncitizens, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSimilar concerns are playing\nout in Miami\nand\nLos Angeles\nas builders worry that lost labor from raids on job sites will increase costs and delay construction timelines.\nThe\nfederal spotlight on Chicago\nis also reigniting long-festering concerns about Chicago\u2019s safety. Trump has hammered on Chicago in public events and on social media, calling crime in the city \u201cout of control\u201d and branding the city a \u201cwar zone.\u201d\nNational Guard troops from Illinois and Texas were briefly deployed in early October before a court order restricted their deployment. The troops remain federalized and stationed in Illinois as the court process plays out.\nGrigory Pekarsky, managing broker of Vesta Preferred Realty, said he worries the heightened negative attention on Chicago will make people rethink buying property in the city. Already, he\u2019s seen some people drop out of the market because of the high tensions: one of the brokers on his team recently had a client cancel because of the National Guard deployment.\nShowing activity is still high citywide, but anecdotally, Pekarsky said buyers are less likely to make offers and commit to a property since federal intervention in the city has intensified.\n\u201cThe overall sluggishness or concern of making decisions with next steps is a lot more obvious right now,\u201d Pekarsky said. \u201cWhere people just have real hesitations of, how is it going to affect Chicago in general? It certainly is a slowdown.\u201d\n",

The cohort also landed among the city\u2019s leading new development brokers, coming in at No. 13 with $92 million in sales.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known [Glenn] for years and have always admired his relentless work ethic, integrity, and ability to lead at scale,\u201d Serhant said in a statement.\nBefore joining forces with Black, Davis co-led another top team at Elliman with Justin Tuinstra, who went solo after the two ended their decade-long partnership. Davis said at the time that he and Tuinstra split months before he merged his then-10-person cohort with Black\u2019s team.\nDavis also previously worked on new developments with Elliman\u2019s leading team, the Eklund-Gomes Team.\n\u201cWe wish Glenn all the best in his new endeavor,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nDavis is leaving Elliman on the heels of a number of high-profile departures, including the firm\u2019s\nlongtime advisor Neal Sroka\n, who left last month to focus full time on his consulting business after two decades with the brokerage. Another 20-year veteran, Kathy Murray, exited Elliman earlier this summer to join Corcoran.\nSerhant is in the midst of an expansion that began on the East Coast in April 2023 and has broadened to include\nadding an outpost\nin Arizona in March. The five-year-old firm now has 1,300 agents across 13 states, including its latest opening in Newport, Rhode Island earlier this month.\n",

Upon satisfying that mortgage, she re-mortgaged the property in 2022, again with Edward, for $2.5 million.\nThe foreclosure complaint claims that Chapman, who was set to pay over $9,000 per month per the loan terms, defaulted in November 2024 and owes the original $2.5 million loan, interest and late fees.\nChapman, who announced her split with Weinstein in 2017 following sexual assault allegations made against the producer, finalized the divorce in 2021. The previous year, Weinstein had been convicted of third-degree rape and criminal sexual assault in the first degree and sentenced to 23 years in prison.\nThe condo board at 99 Jane Street sued Chapman earlier this year, alleging she had fallen behind on dues, which the foreclosure complaint claims are over $7,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a paltry sum compared to the over $1.4 million that\nGFP Real Estate\nclaims Marchesa owes for unpaid rent and utilities for its fourth-floor lease at 80 Eighth Avenue, according to a lawsuit filed in September. Marchesa also had occupied the 17th floor of the property but surrendered that space in September. GFP is seeking damages for late payments and to have Marchesa removed from the fourth floor.\nA merchant cash advance company also sued Marchesa, Georgina Chapman and Edward Chapman in July, alleging the pair instructed their bank to stop making payments after agreeing to pay $500,000 in receivables for an advance of $300,000.\nChapman rose to prominence when she co-founded Marchesa with Karen Craig in 2004. She married Weinstein in 2007 but distanced herself from him shortly after multiple reports detailed the producer\u2019s rampant criminal sexual activity. Craig left the company in 2019.\nWeinstein himself held a sizable real estate portfolio that he sold off following the rape accusations. That included a $25 million West Village townhouse he and Chapman once lived in together, a Hamptons home in Amagansett sold for $10 million in 2018 and a $16 million Westport, Connecticut,\nproperty\nsold for $16 million. Weinstein also owned an office condo on the third floor of 375 Greenwich Street, which\nsold\nin 2019 for more than $6 million.\nIn 2020, Chapman began dating actor Adrien Brody, who owns a historic castle in upstate New York and a home in the Hollywood Hills.\n",

        "content": "A pair of massive projects in Midtown Miami and Edgewater easily passed a city architectural aesthetics examination.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Urban Development Review Board\napproved the master plan for Midtown Park, a planned $2 billion four-tower mixed-use complex at 3055 North Miami Avenue being built in phases, starting with a Prosper-branded condominium. The board also greenlit the design for a 47-story mixed-use high-rise with 499 apartments for a development site at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard that is currently for sale.\nMidtown Park\nThe board voted 3 to 0 in favor of Midtown Park\u2019s master plan with a few minor tweaks to the exterior of\nMidtown Park Residences by Prosper\n, the project\u2019s first planned building that will rise 28 stories with 288 units ranging from studios to three-bedroom condos. Midtown Park master developers Rosso Development, led by Carlos Rosso, and Midtown Development, led by Alex Vadia, are partnering with Santa Monica, California-based Prosper Hospitality, led by Brian De Lowe and Brad Korzen, on the Prosper-branded project.\nOverall, Midtown Park will have four condominiums, including another 28-story tower and two 17-story buildings. Designed by Coconut Grove-based Arquitectonica, the project will also feature 60,000 square feet of office space, more than 120,000 square feet of retail, two major public plazas, a network of pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and a racquet and padel club.\nMidtown Park is being developed on 5 acres in Midtown Miami that were previously slated for a Walmart store. That project did not move forward due to community opposition. In 2019, Walmart sold the property to Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development for\n$26.4 million\n.\n\n3350 Biscayne Boulevard\nA partnership between Amit Kort and Ofir Gabriel won the board\u2019s unanimous approval for a 47-story mixed-use building with 499 units on an 0.8-acre assemblage at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard and 234-264 Northeast 34th Street. The project also scored a 30 percent parking reduction.\nIn July, Kort and Gabriel relisted the site with a new asking price of\n$34 million\nafter it had been on the market for six months, Michael Hinton with Lee &amp; Associates, who is marketing the assemblage, previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe developers\u2019 Tulip Developments Group raised the price from\n$32 million\nbecause they scored administrative planning and zoning approval under Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, which allows developers to obtain higher density for mixed-use projects that set aside 40 percent of the units for households earning up to 120 percent the area median income (AMI). In Miami-Dade County, the AMI for a one-person household is $86,800.\nDesigned by Miami-based architect Kobi Karp, the project would also include 5,555 square feet of retail on the ground floor, 3,117 square feet of restaurant space on the 45th floor and 620 parking spaces with the 30 percent parking reduction.\nDevelopers typically have more success selling\nsites\nthat come with fully approved permitting plans.",

The asking price for the house, at 915 Franklin Avenue, is about $236 per square foot.\nAccardo, who rose from Al Capone\u2019s bodyguard to reputed boss of the outfit, bought the property with his wife, Clarice, in 1951 for a reported $125,000, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The couple lived there until 1963, when they sold it for roughly $200,000 ($2.1 million adjusted for inflation) as Accardo moved into semi-retirement.\nThe listing, handled privately through\nCompass agent\nMaria Cullerton, describes the home as having the \u201cstately gravitas\u201d of a gubernatorial mansion.\nFeatures include a custom-tiled indoor pool, two-lane bowling alley, English pub, billiard room and rooftop garden. Mexican onyx is used throughout, even in the bathrooms, each with its own sitting area. A gatehouse sits on the 0.68-acre lot as well. The property carried a nearly $48,000 property tax bill in 2023.\n\nAccording to Elite Street, the mansion\u2019s current owners, Jose and Maria Jimenez \u2014 co-founders of the Carnicerias Jimenez grocery chain \u2014 bought the property in 2000 for $1.9 million and have made updates since. Cullerton told the outlet the mansion \u201cfeels like a museum,\u201d citing its craftsmanship and layers of 20th-century opulence.\nIf it trades anywhere near its $5 million ask, it would easily set a residential price record for\nRiver Forest\n. The suburb\u2019s priciest recent sale was a six-bedroom home that fetched\n$2.85 million in June\n. The next-highest active listing is a 5,600-square-foot home on Lathrop Avenue priced at $3.3 million.\nMob-era nostalgia drives intrigue in Chicago\u2019s near western suburbs.

Hobby Jr. State Office Building site, a three-building complex at 333 Guadalupe Street, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe GLO teased in July that it had inked a deal with a \u201cprominent developer\u201d but kept the name under wraps until now. Hines confirmed the partnership this week, while the state agency declined to provide further details on what\u2019s planned for the roughly 2-acre property, which holds a vacant 419,000-square-foot state office complex.\nThe project marks the end of a months-long selection process that drew bids from some of the state\u2019s biggest players, including Related Companies, Endeavor Real Estate Group, DHA Capital and Urbanspace, according to records obtained by the outlet. The\nGLO\nsaid its decision weighed developers\u2019 experience and financial strength, calling\nHines\na \u201cTexas business with a sterling reputation.\u201d\nWhile plans remain under wraps, the state has previously indicated it wants a mixed-use redevelopment incorporating residential and commercial components, with workforce housing among them.\nThe site could be redeveloped by right to a maximum of 1.9 million square feet, with no height maximum or parking requirements, according to a CBRE\nbrochure\n.\n\nThe sky is the limit, aside from financing and construction costs. Maxing out density-bonus zoning could yield an 18-story office building, a 20-story hotel with 600 keys and 650 resi units soaring 104 stories, plus retail and parking, the marketing materials suggested.\nThe site\u2019s location \u2014 next door to the newly opened 800,000-square-foot office tower\nThe Republic\n\u2014 makes it one of the most high-profile redevelopment opportunities in the Texas capital.\nThe Hobby Building, which has been deteriorating for years, was slated for demolition but is still standing. Once cleared, the block could anchor a wave of density on Austin\u2019s west side, where private projects have increasingly filled the skyline gaps once dominated by government properties.\nFor Hines, the deal extends its deepening Austin footprint. The firm is behind the\nT3 Eastside\nmass-timber office building and several master-planned communities in the metro. It also has plans for a 608,000-square-foot office project at\nThe Domain\n, after shelving a prior build-to-suit for\nIBM\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Deputy Supervisor Cate Rogers told the board that only about half of the 1,874 listings found through analytics firm AirDNA are registered under East Hampton\u2019s rental registry law, which has been in place since 2015 and requires a $200 permit.\nRogers said the proliferation of homes purchased and flipped by out-of-town investors \u2014 many backed by specialized lenders and property managers \u2014 has distorted the local market.\n\u201cI do think we are looking at commercial investment in our residential districts by investors who only seek to make profit and are not looking at being part of this community at all,\u201d she said.\nThe town\u2019s rules already restrict short-term rentals to 14 days at a time, and no more than twice in a six-month period, but enforcement has proved cumbersome. The monitoring software could help pinpoint violators and track investor ownership, following the example of nearby Southold, which adopted the Rentalscape platform earlier this year.\n\nWhile Rogers floated several potential reforms \u2014 such as creating a dedicated section of the town code for short-term rentals, imposing a local tax, or raising registration fees \u2014 board members struck a cautious tone, warning that overregulation could harm the seasonal rental economy that underpins much of East Hampton\u2019s tourism sector.\nCouncilperson Ian Calder-Piedmonte said the board must \u201cmake sure that we don\u2019t become purely seasonal, and that we have a healthy, vibrant year-round community that we\u2019ve always had,\u201d emphasizing that the town\u2019s challenge is balancing visitor demand with year-round livability.\nOthers, like Councilperson David Lys, noted that many local families rely on rental income to make ends meet.\nEast Hampton\u2019s consideration mirrors a broader East End push to\nrein in short-term rentals\n.

        "content": "A Miami design review board greenlit two Live Local Act projects in Wynwood Norte and Overtown with nearly 800 units, combined.\nABH Developer Group, led by Alexis Bogomolni, plans the Modis Architects-designed 36-story Wyn Park tower with 293 units and a rooftop restaurant at 3311 and 3327 Northwest Second Avenue, 169 Northwest 33rd Street and 182 Northwest 34th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood Norte neighborhood. In Overtown, an entity tied to Alan Omsky, co-founder of the KYU restaurant, plans a Kobi Karp-designed 55-story, 498-unit tower at 1210 Northwest Second Avenue and 211 and 223 Northwest 12th Street.\nThe developers designated 40 percent of apartments at their towers \u2013\u2013 or 117 units at Wyn Park and 200 units at the Overtown project \u2013\u2013 for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income, consistent with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board approved\nthe projects\nat its meeting on Wednesday. Board members raved about Kobi Karp\u2019s design of the Overtown tower and approved it with a 3 to 0 vote. They were less thrilled about Modis\u2019 design of Wyn Park and approved it with a 2 to 1 vote. (The UDRB has 11 members, with three of them present for the vote on the projects.)\n\u201cI just can\u2019t get on board with it as a successful articulation. \u2026 The attempts on the fa\u00e7ade. The Lego-esque pieces,\u201d board member Dean Lewis said about Wyn Park. \u201cThe podium and the tower are trying to be related, but at the same time, I just don\u2019t see that fluidity in the dialogue. I see you knitting but I don\u2019t see you weaving.\u201d\nThe tower also lacks \u201csignage or stimulus\u201d to denote the rooftop restaurant, Lewis said.\n\u201cHow does this fit in Miami and the polycultural impact and the styles?\u201d he added.\nUDRB Chair Ligia Ines Labrada was more receptive to the design, saying the architect handled the ground-floor retail \u201csuccessfully.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t mind how you weaved the podium with the tower,\u201d she said, suggesting the architect can tweak the darker colors. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough project.\u201d\nLabrada and board member Manuel Gustavo Gallardo voted to approve the project with several conditions, including that the architect reconsider the rooftop design, extend the ground-floor canopy and revisit the massing, materials and colors on the fa\u00e7ade. Lewis voted against the project.\n\nThe board approved Omsky\u2019s project with much less discussion.\n\u201cI really do appreciate the project. And you get an economy of gesture without overly pushing,\u201d Lewis said.\nThe tower\u2019s podium will include permanent exterior murals of portraits of Overtown residents by artist Yana Volf.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to bring the art of Overtown into Overtown,\u201d Karp said during the meeting, adding that the tower will be of condominium quality. \u201cSome people said to me, \u2018We would like to have a quality project in the community that is within the Live Local [Act].\u2019\u201d\nBoard members still imposed some conditions for its approval, including that the architect study the possibility of doing the murals as live art through a projection, add planters along the sidewalk and tweak the design to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the main entrance.\nThe UDRB\u2019s vote is merely a recommendation, and final say rests with the city\u2019s planning and zoning department officials.\nDevelopers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith a flurry of project proposals. The state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows developers to build larger projects as long as they include affordable and workforce apartments. The units have to remain income restricted for at least 30 years.\nIn Miami\u2019s Allapattah, Calta Group scored UDRB approval last month for its Live Local Act project, the 30-story, 499-unit\nAnatomia\nat 1415\u20131469 Northwest 13th Terrace. Midtown Capital plans a\n22-story, 348-unit\ntower at 7501 and 7553 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami\u2019s Little River.\nIn the biggest known South Florida Live Local Act project, Spanish developer Pablo Castro and Laura Tauber of Bay Harbor Islands-based real estate firm Taubco plan the\nThe HueHub\nwith 4,032 units in seven 35-story towers at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue in Miami-Dade County\u2019s\nWest Little River neighborhood.\n",

The activist investor reportedly has built an active stake in Rexford, making it one of the top five investors.\nRexford only said \u201cyes have met with Elliott, and we have a constructive dialogue, as we encourage with all of our shareholders.\u201d When asked again, the company said it isn\u2019t in a position to comment on the nature of those discussions.\nNonetheless, Rexford executed 3.3 million square feet of new and renewed leases in the quarter, according to an earnings release.\n\nRexford offloaded three properties, two in Los Angeles County, for $53.6 million: one, at 8542 Slauson Avenue, cost $17.3 million, and another at 15715 Arrow Highway, cost $21.6 million. The latter property was supposed to be redeveloped but was instead sold to the in-place tenant.\nThe company has sold six properties so far this year for $187.6 million. It has another $160 million of dispositions under contract or accepted offer. But Rexford currently has no acquisitions, a shift from its\nbuying spree\nof a few years ago.\nRevenues increased to $253.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $241.8 million last year.\nIn Los Angeles County, where more than half of Rexford\u2019s holdings are \u2014 260 properties per its latest financial statement \u2014 the industrial vacancy rate is 5 percent. The vacancy rate for Rexford\u2019s holdings in the area is about 9 percent.\u00a0During its earnings call, the company mentioned an uncertain macroeconomic environment and the president\u2019s tariff policies as affecting tenant demand.\n",

The tough market conditions don\u2019t seem to be an obstacle for 93-year-old Bren, who famously restarted homebuilding in 2009 as developers were still picking up the pieces post-housing crash and has made a name as a pioneer in master-planned communities.\n\u201cFulfilling the vision of master planning has been a lifetime dedication and lifetime passion,\u201d Bren said in a statement to the Southern California News Group, which publishes the Orange County Register, Los Angeles Daily News and nine other newspapers in the region, and counts the Mercury News as a sister publication.\n\u201cI am hopeful the heritage of our stewardship will live on in many new ways,\u201d Bren said.\n\nPart of Irvine Company\u2019s efforts include converting offices, malls and industries sites into residential communities.\nIn Orange County, the firm has 1,481 apartments in the pipeline on two parcels near Irvine Spectrum shopping center previously set aside for offices. A 313-unit expansion of an existing complex next to Great Park is close to completion. Another 1,858 units are planned for a different Spectrum site previously slated for commercial use. An additional\n2,500 apartments are in the works near UC Irvine\n, and another 1,336 units will be built on land the company owns in Tustin. Plus, retail space at The Market Place shopping center in Irvine is being converted into 1,261 apartments, now pre-leasing. Further south in San Diego, 552 apartments are being proposed for an existing office campus near the University Town Center.\nOne person Bren won\u2019t be able to count on to continue his legacy is his own son, 33-year-old David Bren. Earlier this month, as scrutiny grew on the young son over an alleged real estate scam, a spokesperson for the elder Bren and Irvine Company shared a statement\ndistancing themselves from his son\n, saying they \u201cdo not have a personal or business relationship with this individual.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Some\nluxury buyers\n, she said, are purchasing homes months before they plan to move, leaving them empty until the timing suits \u2014 a flexibility most buyers can\u2019t afford.\nRecent examples abound: private equity executive Tom Soueles\u2019 $6.5 million mansion on\nBurling Street\nfound a buyer in seven days; Wilmette homes listed for $3.7 million and $5.3 million each went under contract in under a week; and a Deming Place rowhouse drew an offer in three days.\n@properties\nChristie\u2019s agent Alexa Hara said her clients offered 13 percent over ask \u2014 pushing a Winnetka listing above $3 million \u2014 to secure a renovated 1917 home facing the village green.\nSome contracts could still fall through, as with a $4.25 million listing on Magnolia Avenue that briefly went contingent before reentering the market.

        "content": "Marc Holliday isn\u2019t giving up on the dream of a Times Square casino.\nAfter an advisory committee rejected SL Green\u2019s bid for a casino at 1515 Broadway a month ago, Holliday on Thursday said the company\u2019s proposal \u201cisn\u2019t completely dead.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole process and the outcome is unknown,\u201d Holliday said on SL Green\u2019s third quarter earnings call. \u201cHow many bidders will there be? How many licenses will be awarded? And whether, if any are held back, there will be another shot for casinos in Manhattan or otherwise to come into play.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is still a process that\u2019s playing out,\u201d he added.\nSL Green\u2019s proposal for a casino with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation was rejected in September. The decision prompted Holliday\nto lash out\nat the committee members, and he continued to criticize the process on the earnings call.\nOther Manhattan\nproposals\nby Silverstein Properties and Stefan Soloviev were also rejected.\n\nAfter that, favorites for the licenses appeared to be Resorts World NYC in Queens and Steve Cohen\u2019s bid next to Citi Field. But on Monday, MGM Resorts announced it was\ndropping what was considered a shoo-in bid\nfor a casino in Yonkers, possibly putting another license back into play.\nHolliday said that 1515 Broadway\u2019s biggest tenant, Paramount Global, is in a stronger financial position after it was purchased by Skydance Media in August for $8.4 billion, though it was unclear what the company\u2019s space needs would be.\nHe said one of the benefits of making the casino bid was that SL Green learned the building converts well to other uses, like entertainment or a hotel, and that the property has good financial flexibility with low debt.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good scenario for us to look at all options,\u201d he said.\nAcross its portfolio, SL Green reported office occupancy of 92.4 percent. Holliday said the company is on track to hit its goal of 93.2 percent by the end of the year.\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Supreme Court denied Two Roads Development\u2019s request to hear the case involving a complex condo buyout in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, effectively ending Two Roads\u2019 legal avenues to challenge an earlier ruling.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads has long planned to develop an Edition Residences on the site of the former Biscayne 21 condo building at 2121 North Bayshore Drive in Miami.\nBut those plans were\nput on hold\nwhen a group of holdout condo owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled condo association in 2023. The suit was over the amendment of the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nOn Tuesday, Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined to weigh in on Two Roads\u2019 request, and denied the petition for review. The court wrote in a filing this week that it will not consider a motion for rehearing.\nTwo Roads, its attorney Jason Gonzalez and the holdout owners\u2019 attorney, Glen Waldman, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Two Roads declined to comment.\nFlorida\u2019s Supreme Court was Two Roads\u2019 last hope regarding the allegation that the developer illegally amended Biscayne 21\u2019s condo declaration. Earlier this year, the Third District Court of Appeal\ndenied Two Roads\u2019 request\nfor a rehearing, siding with the holdout unit owners. The appeals court\u2019s opinion affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nRobert Murphy, one of the holdout owners suing Two Roads, said he is \u201cgrateful to the Florida appellate courts for upholding our contractual rights.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy in the way a rape victim might feel happy when the jury comes back with a guilty verdict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s ameasure of satisfaction that justice has been done, but you still live with the rape.\u201d\nThe outcome of the case could affect potential buyouts and terminations of condo associations with similar condo declarations, if the developer-controlled associations try to amend the condo termination threshold the same way.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit of a different take in that some people have commented that they think this will have a big chilling effect [on condo buyouts],\u201d said Miami-based Haber Law attorney David Podein, who is not involved in the case. \u201cI think many people have overstated what the third DCA ruled. I view this condo termination scenario as very specific.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, originally filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, will continue unless the developer settles with the remaining owners. It\u2019s unknown how Two Roads plans to move forward now.\n\u201cThe owners who have fought this, they may simply be seeking leverage,\u201d said Haber Law\u2019s Jonathan Goldstein, who is also not involved in the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of their incentives, to stick it out and stay and never sell, or to leverage more money.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also unclear how the developer will pay off the financing linked to the site. Two Roads has been on the hook for mounting interest, in the millions of dollars, on loans tied to the 2022 bulk purchase, filings show. Two Roads\u2019 TRD Biscayne financed the 2022 bulk purchase with a $45 million mezzanine loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC, the asset management affiliate of Fisher Brothers, and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK.\nThe timeline\nThree years ago, Two Roads\npaid about $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront condo building, which was constructed in 1964. Later that year, the developer\nlaunched sales\nof the first of three planned Edition towers, a 55-story, 185-unit tower, with unit prices starting at $1.7 million.\nHoldout owners Angelica Avila, Nicolas Bello, Maria Beatriz Gutierrez, Franah Vazir-Marino, Murphy, George Garcia, and two couples, Lazaro Fraga and Jacqueline S. Fraga, and Jeffrey Ulman and Shari Ulman, sued the following year.\nIn 2024, the Third DCA reversed a lower court decision that had denied the holdout owners a temporary injunction. The lower court had determined that amending the termination requirement did not \u201calter\u201d the voting rights of the unit owners. The Third DCA disagreed with this, and said that amending the vote threshold did alter the unit owners\u2019 voting rights.\nShortly after the Third DCA issued its opinion, the developer requested a rehearing. It took more than a year for the Third DCA to react and side with the holdouts.\n",

The seller was local firm Mardit Properties. The deal works out to $8.5 million per acre.\nSunnyvale city officials already\napproved plans for 242 residential units\nat the site, consisting of 162 apartments and 80 townhomes. The development application was filed by San Jose-based developer\nValley Oak Partners\n. The proposal also calls for a two-level parking garage and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nOrchard Supply Hardware closed all of its stores in 2018. Some of its sites were bought by retailer Outdoor Supply Hardware, while real estate developers bought other locations.\nEven Google owns one of the former locations, in downtown San Jose. That store was within the tech giant\u2019s\nproposed transit-oriented neighborhood development\n, which hasn\u2019t started construction though it\u2019s been in the works for years.\n\nMillrose Properties often provides homebuilders with a capital flow for efforts to build residential projects. New Home Company Northern California, for example, has an option to buy the property from Millrose, though the full terms of the option agreement have not been disclosed.\nThe construction and homebuilding markets are struggling nationwide this year amid high interest rates and tariff uncertainty.\nElsewhere in the Bay Area, Millrose Properties\nbought an 11-acre, three-building office campus at Bishop Ranch\nin San Ramon earlier this year from developer Sunset Development for $50 million. Trumark Homes plans to redevelop the site into nearly 200 residential units, including 67 single-family homes and 128 attached townhomes.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Mark Wahlberg dropped $32.6 million on a flipped mansion in the gated Stone Creek Ranch neighborhood near Delray Beach.\nWahlberg\u2019s Closest to Delray LLC, managed by attorneys Stanley Lim and Brian Dentel, bought the mansion at 9200 Rockybrook Way from spec developer Aldo Stark\u2019s Stone Creek Ranch Homes LLC, records show.\nSenada Ad\u017eem with Douglas Elliman had the listing, and Michael Costello with Compass brought the buyer.\nWahlberg is an actor, musician and entrepreneur known for his roles in hit films such as \u201cThe Departed,\u201d \u201cBoogie Nights,\u201d \u201cTed\u201d and \u201cThe Other Guys,\u201d as well as his burger restaurant chain Wahlburger.\n\nStark is a spec developer with a track record of building high-profile luxury homes in Stone Creek Ranch and Fort Lauderdale. In December, he sold a James Bond-inspired spec estate dubbed \u201cVilla Spectre\u201d for\n$36.8 million\nto retired Memorex CEO Barry Smith. In January, he sold a Ferrari-inspired mansion for\n$41.5 million\nto the Cafaro family, whose patriarch William M. Cafaro is considered a pioneer of the American mall.\nIn turn, Stark bought the 2.7-acre 9200 Rockybrook Way home from the Cafaros for\n$26 million\nin January. He completed an extensive renovation of the mansion, dubbed \u201cPalazzo di Lago,\u201d which spans 17,800 square feet. It has seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a theater, wine room, gym and sauna, records and the listing show. It also has a guest house, pool and cigar lounge.\nStark listed it for $45 million in March, Zillow shows. Listing sites show the total sale price is $37 million, which Costello confirmed includes furniture.\nCostello declined to comment on the buyer, but said privacy and lot size are major draws for buyers in Stone Creek Ranch. In 2023, Wahlberg sold a 6.2-acre, 30,500-square-foot Beverly Park estate in Los Angeles for\n$55 million\n.",

        "content": "More\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects in Beverly Hills\nare moving forward after additional approvals from the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.\nOn Tuesday, the city\u2019s Planning Commission gave the green light to two builder\u2019s remedy projects in the Los Angeles-area enclave, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe first development is a 12-story, approximately 124-foot-tall building at 346 North Maple Drive being pursued by a joint venture between\ndeveloper Leo Pustilnikov\nand Oak Investment Company, an affiliate of Beverly Hills-based Dromy International Investment Corporation. The plan is to replace an existing two-story, eight-unit residential building with a 65-unit residential tower containing studio, one- and two-bedroom units above a 15-car garage. The 346 Maple project will have to provide 13 units of low-income affordable housing in order to qualify for builder\u2019s remedy.\nBack in August, a Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that Beverly Hills violated state housing law by trying to block Pustilnikov\u2019s proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant at\n125-129 South Linden Drive\n. Pustilnikov explained his thought process in challenging the city at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable\nevent in September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Roosevelt approach: Speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d he said, referring to former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.. \u201cBeverly Hills is doing it to themselves. They had an opportunity to just have Linden, and they refused to cooperate and now they have 12 projects.\u201d\n\nNear the 346 North Maple site, DH 1821 Daly received approval for an 11-story development at 401 North Oakhurst Drive, which would rise approximately 131 feet, with 25 two-bedroom apartments, including five low-income units. The residences will be built above parking for 14 vehicles.\nBoth the Maple and Oakhurst developments are being designed by Ottinger Architects.\nThe latest approvals come a week after the Planning Commission took up three other builder\u2019s remedy applications at locations near the intersection of Beverly Drive and Olympic Boulevard. As with those applications, the City either couldn\u2019t make the findings required to deny the proposals for 346 Maple and 401 Oakhurst or is prohibited by state housing law from rejecting them.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates community is still a mess nine months later, while the rest of the Palisades burn zone has been cleaned up.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency refused to include the 170-unit mobile home park in its debris-removal program, leaving residents with few options on how to proceed, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Los Angeles\u2019 Building and Safety Commission answered residents\u2019 call this week to declare the area a public nuisance. In doing so, the city can order the site to be cleaned up and bill the landowners.\nThe situation comes after the\nfastest wildfire debris removal effort\nin modern American history. FEMA\u2019s snub reportedly stemmed from the agency\u2019s mistrust of the owners of the rent-controlled community, as it didn\u2019t believe the owners would restore the property, on a bluff near the Pacific Coast HIghway, as affordable housing.\nMeanwhile, across a shared property line, the privately owned rent-controlled Tahitian Terrace mobile home park did qualify for FEMA aid after the agency determined its owners lacked the financial means to clean up asbestos-laced debris. FEMA made an exception in that case, saying the cleanup would help preserve a piece of affordable housing in the Pacific Palisades.\n\nThe Palisades Bowl\u2019s owners, heirs to late investor Edward Biggs, received $1.2 million in insurance funds and, according to FEMA, have the means to clear the property themselves.\nBiggs and his family previously squabbled with residents and the city in court over rent control and alleged neglect, and at one point floated plans for redevelopment into an \u201cupscale resort community.\u201d Residents won multimillion-dollar settlements, though doubts remained that the ownership intended to maintain affordability.\nStill, displaced residents wonder if the Palisades Bowl community will ever exist again.\n\u201cThey never do anything unless they are absolutely forced to,\u201d Jon Brown, a resident leading the rebuilding fight, told the outlet. \u201cIf we could go back, we\u2019d start again \u2014 with a vengeance.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Horizon Realty Group cashed out quickly on a planned office-to-residential conversion in\nStreeterville\n, selling the century-old Pelouze Building in Streeterville to another local developer with a nearly identical plan.\nHorizon\nsold the seven-story loft building at 230 East Ohio Street last month for $9.75 million to affiliates of Wildwood Investments, according to property records and CoStar data. The sale price is well above the $5.6 million Horizon paid just a year earlier, underscoring the white-hot appetite for multifamily conversions in Chicago, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 1917 structure, designed by architect\nAlfred Alschuler\n, was once home to the Pelouze Scale &amp; Manufacturing Company and later hosted the office of\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe\n. It even had a brush with pop culture, serving as the exterior backdrop for the 1980s CBS sitcom Mary starring Mary Tyler Moore.\nHorizon\u2019s plan to convert the roughly 65,000-square-foot building into 72 apartments was already underway before the sale. The firm had completed interior demolition and relocated remaining office tenants, paving the way for a seamless handoff.\n\u201cWe finished the prep work,\u201d Horizon COO Jeff Michael told the outlet, declining to elaborate on the decision to sell what would have been the company\u2019s first office-to-resi project.\nWildwood, led by Matt Katsaros, confirmed it will proceed with the residential conversion but offered no further details.\n\nThe deal comes as Chicago\u2019s apartment market outperforms the rest of the country. CoStar data shows the region leading the nation in multifamily rent growth, buoyed by limited new supply as rising borrowing and construction costs slowed development. By contrast, rents in Sun Belt cities \u2014 after years of breakneck building \u2014 have begun to soften.\nWith construction increasingly difficult to finance, Chicago developers are turning to existing office stock to fill the gap.\nAdaptive reuse\nprojects are proliferating in the Loop, River North and Streeterville, where aging commercial buildings are being reimagined as housing to meet surging demand.\nThe Pelouze Building offers both history and opportunity for Wildwood \u2014 a character-rich asset in a neighborhood short on new apartments.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Four years ago, I\nhelped a friend in Austin\nlook for a place to buy in the Dallas metro area.\nDallas was cheaper than Austin, where he was renting an 800-square-foot apartment for $1,400 a month. The rise of remote work meant he was free to move anywhere.\nIt was an eye-opening experience for this lifelong New Yorker, because we have normalized the astronomical prices we pay for housing here.\nShopping in Dallas\nwas like going back in time.\nMaybe you\u2019re one of those people who reminisces about what homes in New York City cost 30 years ago, and wish you had bought more of them, or not sold what you had. \u201cIf only we had snapped up that fixer-upper that went for $600,000. It just sold for $6 million!\u201d my wife said once. (We couldn\u2019t afford it at the time anyway.)\nI recall house-hunting in 1993, when one-bedroom co-ops in Park Slope were as little as $75,000 and three-bedroom condos in landmarked brownstones went for $220,000. Everything is about eight times more expensive now.\nBut in Arlington, Texas, in late 2021, homes were trading for what they did in New York City in the early \u201990s. My friend was on a tight budget, had zero savings and owed thousands of dollars on his credit cards, so I tried to get him to buy a\n793-square-foot one-bedroom\n, newly remodeled with stainless steel appliances, for the preposterous price of $85,000.\nThe mortgage payment, insurance, property taxes and homeowners\u2019 association fees would have been $782 per month. The condo had a pool, too. It was so cheap, I thought about buying it myself.\nBut my friend had delusions of grandeur, which is how he had ended up in his sorry financial situation at the age of 56, despite being gainfully employed and having no family to support. He wanted someplace better, with more resale value, even though he expected to never sell.\nIn early 2022, he lost a bunch of bidding wars in the $130,000 to $150,000 range. Without my knowledge, he eventually bid $195,000 (which he couldn\u2019t afford) for a condo in North Dallas, a \u201cnicer\u201d (read: wealthier) neighborhood with \u201cbetter\u201d schools (even though he had no kids).\nFortunately, the deal fell through because the Biden administration\u2019s new rules for Fannie and Freddie required the condo to have more money in reserve than it did.\nI talked some sense into my friend, who then bought a similar unit in Arlington for $128,000. His mortgage, property taxes and insurance today are $793 a month. For the first time ever, he could save for retirement without repeatedly raiding his 401(k). He has since paid off his credit cards and put away $67,000.\nHe was able to achieve life-altering financial and housing stability because homes are so cheap in Arlington. Obviously, Texas is different from New York City in many ways, but it\u2019s noteworthy that Arlington achieved low-cost housing without rent regulation or subsidies. It simply let developers build basic, three-story complexes.\nThe state that most famously did the opposite, California, now has such high housing costs that many of its non-rich\nresidents are moving to Texas\n.\n\nBut there\u2019s a sad ending to this tale now developing: Texas localities are\nbanning apartment development\nby adopting some of the same restrictive rules that have made homes so costly in California (and New York, for that matter), as Jay Parsons\nrecently explained\n.\nHere\u2019s hoping state lawmakers manage to stop them before they learn California\u2019s lesson the hard way.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has said he was earning only $47,000 a year when he signed his first lease for his $2,300-a-month, rent-stabilized apartment in Queens. \u201cI was looking for an apartment that I could afford on my own,\u201d he\ntold\nthe New York Editorial Board. He omitted that landlords typically require tenants\u2019 annual income at lease-signing to be 40 times the rent, which would have been more than $90,000. How did he get the apartment? Send guesses to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Of the 191,000 apartments built over the past decade that received a city subsidy, only about 3 percent had three or more bedrooms, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed legislation that, in her words, \u201cbans collusion using algorithm-enabled rent price fixing.\u201d The Real Estate Board of New York had asked Hochul to make some chapter amendments to the bill, S7882/A1417-B, but she didn\u2019t.\nThe measure didn\u2019t seem like a high priority for REBNY, though, because it doesn\u2019t outright ban software programs that help landlords price their rentals. Assembly sponsor Linda Rosenthal had\nalready amended the bill\n.\nThe bill summary says the legislation \u201cprohibits a person or entity from knowingly or with reckless disregard facilitating an agreement between two or more residential rental property owners or managers to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units, including by operating or licensing a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function \u2026 among such residential rental property owners or managers.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$4.75 million\nfor a 3,443-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$20 million\nfor a 27,020-square-foot auto body repair facility at 127-48 Northern Boulevard in Corona.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 12,250-square-foot townhouse at 11 Gramercy Park South. Adam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg of the Modlin Group have the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills is preparing for a showdown with\nMax Netty\n\u2019s\nSoundview Investment\nover a proposed builder\u2019s remedy development on Rodeo Drive.\nThe city has received \u201ca written threat of litigation\u201d over a proposed development project at 145 South Rodeo Drive, according to an\nagenda\nfor the City Council\u2019s closed session conference with legal counsel Friday afternoon.\nThe site is just south of Wilshire Boulevard, about a quarter-mile away from Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.\nThe saber rattling on the proposed development, which would replace a two-story office building, came in an email from Netty\u2019s lawyer in May, shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The looming showdown comes as Beverly Hills has\nbegun signing off\non some other projects in the tony enclave.\n\u201cThe attached letter is a denial of the project because it takes away the ability to proceed under builder\u2019s remedy,\u201d Ryan Leaderman of Holland and Knight wrote in the email to the city. \u201cWithout a modification to the City\u2019s position on this issue, litigation is highly likely given the denial of the project as proposed.\u201d\nBuilder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat have failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans. Beverly Hills was subject to builder\u2019s remedy for several months but is now in compliance with the state\u2019s requirements, known as the \u201chousing element\u201d on plans for housing development.\n\u201cPlease let me know if there is going to be a change in the City\u2019s position,\u201d Leaderman wrote. \u201cI assume that you might need to go to City Council for a closed session discussion.\u201d\nThe proposed development on Rodeo Drive would replace a two-story office building. Soundview wants to construct a new mixed-use development, per a May 1 email the city sent Leaderman. City officials said the latest application differs significantly from a previously approved plan, and has been deemed ineligible for processing as a \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy project.\u201d\nThe city claims the preliminary application was submitted in February 2024 as all rental units.\nThe more recent plans include a subdivision that now includes condominiums as well as rentals.\n\n\u201cCity staff has determined in good faith that the 145 South Rodeo Drive project is a different project than the [preliminary application] project because of the omission of subdivision information,\u201d the city wrote.\nIn addition, the letter says the 180-day deadline to resubmit an application expired on Aug. 24, 2024.\nThe latest proposal does not comply with the city\u2019s zoning ordinances in its height and density, and therefore needs builder\u2019s remedy to override city rules.\n\u201cIt is not a valid builder\u2019s remedy project, and thus can no longer rely on the builder\u2019s remedy provisions of Government Code Section 65589.5 to insulate the Development Application Project from the general plan and zoning consistency requirements,\u201d the letter says.\nTo proceed with the development application project, the developer would have to seek general plan and zoning amendments for non-builder\u2019s remedy projects.\nLeaderman was \u201cout sick\u201d per an email, and a city attorney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe cases could be impacted by Leo Pustilnikov\u2019s\nvictory in superior court\nin August. A judge ruled that Beverly Hills violated state housing law in its attempt to block his proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant at 125-129 South Linden Drive. Pustilnikov\u2019s projects got a greenlight from the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.\nNetty\u2019s Soundview, meanwhile, also has proposed a\n27-unit condominium development\nat 140 South Camden Drive, a block south of Wilshire Boulevard, which appears bound for a showdown with city officials, too.\n\u201cPlease also be aware that we are preparing to litigate for the 140 S. Camden project as well,\u201d Leaderman wrote.\n",

        "content": "Prolific Chicago investor Stuart Handler recently sold a three-property multifamily portfolio in\nHyde Park\nfor $23.5 million.\nThe transaction came out to roughly $113,000 per unit. Records of the sale have not been made public yet, and Kiser Group brokers Aaron Sklar and Noah Birk, who represented Handler, declined to identify the buyer.\nThe sale is welcome news for the South Side, where a recent\nfederal raid drew nationwide controversy\n. Amid an immigration enforcement\ncrackdown\nin Chicago, federal agents arrested 37 people for a variety of charges at a South Shore apartment building on Sept. 30, leaving residents shaken and local officials questioning the federal government\u2019s tactics.\n\u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t a great look on the South Side, but there\u2019s a million other buildings where things are going great and the neighborhoods are feeling vibrant,\u201d Birk said.\nHandler, who is the namesake behind the University of Illinois Chicago\u2019s Handler Department of Real Estate, was a longtime owner of the portfolio and has been actively\nbuying\nand\nselling\nChicago multifamily properties throughout the past year.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most-respected operators without a doubt in Chicago, but probably nationally as well,\u201d Sklar said.\nLast spring, Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management sold a 136-unit apartment building on the South Side, at 4817 South Drexel Boulevard. Jeremy Bronfman\u2019s Lincoln Avenue Communities snagged the property for $31 million or about $227,000 per unit.\n\nAround the same time, Handler bought a 192-unit property in the northwest suburb of Mount Prospect for $60 million or about $312,000 per unit. Local developer Wingspan Development Group was the seller.\nThe Hyde Park properties, near the University of Chicago, have 207 studio and one bedroom units and 127,000 square feet. Rents range from about $1,100 to $1,200 for the studios and about $1,400 for the one-bedroom units. The three buildings bring in about $1.7 million in net operating income, according to the listing.\nThe studio and one-bedroom properties are located at 5326 South Cornell Avenue, 5417-25 South Harper Avenue, 5210-14 South Woodlawn Avenue in Hyde Park and 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue in Lakeview.\nWhen Handler listed the Hyde Park portfolio,\nhe also listed a pair of North Side multifamily buildings\nat 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue.\nChicago-based J&amp;J Equities bought The West Wellington Avenue building in Lakeview for $10.8 million this August. J&amp;J Equities made the purchase, which came out to about $150,000 per unit, as a part of a 1031 exchange.\nThe other Lakeview property is under contract, Birk and Sklar said.\nHandler\u2019s transactions are part of a busy streak of\nmultifamily\nsales in Chicago as the market continues to outperform the Sun Belt amid historically low new supply coming online.",

The chamber is working to help Vanderbilt get settled, said Rodney Fong, CEO and president of the chamber.\nThe study considered other locations downtown, including\nSalesforce Tower\n, the Embarcadero and Jackson Square, but \u201cit really sort of arrived at the Fifth and Mission corridor for the core reasons of transportation,\u201d Fong said.\nOther opportunities in the area include the Old Mint building, the\nbeleaguered San Francisco Centre mall\nand the Fifth and Mission Garage.\n\nThe 5M Project\u2019s un-redeveloped properties include Hearst\u2019s 110 Fifth Street, which has been\napproved for a 400-unit condo tower\n, as well as the San Francisco Chronicle building at 901 Mission Street. Other buildings include a 302-unit apartment tower at 434 Minna Street and a 640,000-square-foot office tower at 415 Natoma Street that has high vacancy.\nThe university reportedly hasn\u2019t made a deal yet.\nVanderbilt has about 13,000 students and is trending toward coastal expansion, with hubs in the works in New York City and South Florida. Its planned $520 million campus in West Palm Beach received a\n$50 million donation\nfrom power player Stephen Ross of the Related Companies this year.\nAnd in New York, it received approval last month for a\n99-year groundlease\nwith the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt is expanding in its hometown as well. It\u2019s seeking developers for 40 acres it owns in Midtown Nashville for an\ninnovation district\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Central Texas sellers are coming to terms with\nbuyer leverage\n.\nAs fall began, sellers in the\nAustin-Round Rock-San Marcos area\nentered the market more cautiously and accepted deeper price cuts, according to Unlock MLS.\nSeptember brought the lowest close-to-list price ratio this year at 91.6 percent, along with the narrowest year-over-year increase in active listings.\nThere were 10 percent more homes for sale last month than in September 2024, compared to a 13 percent year-over-year increase in August and a peak increase this year of 19.7 percent in April.\nDespite the deceleration, fall has its music, too, as the poem goes. Closings increased 6.7 last month compared to a year ago, the broadest jump so far this year. That metric lagged behind 2024 for most of the year; before September, only January and June had year-over-year increases.\nConcurrently, sales volume increased 5.6 percent year over year to $1.3 billion, making September the only month besides June to exceed the previous year\u2019s volume.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strongest sales growth we\u2019ve seen in 2025,\u201d said Brandy Wuensch, CEO of Unlock MLS and the Austin Board of Realtors.\n\nInventory growth is slowing, and parties are negotiating lower deals.\n\u201cBuyers are returning to the market, they\u2019re gaining confidence, knowing that they have more negotiating power. And sellers are also understanding that, if they want to move, they need to be flexible in negotiating in these terms,\u201d Wuensch said.\nWhile some agents say the\nAustin\narea has become a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, Wuensch considers it a balanced market.\n\u201cWhen we see our inventory go over six months, that\u2019s where you\u2019re in a true buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Wuensch said.\nThe Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area has exceeded six months of inventory just once this year, reaching 6.1 in July. September had 5.7 months of inventory, a year-over-year increase of 0.6 and a month-over-month decline of 0.2.\nSellers weren\u2019t eager to enter the market. New listings in September trailed last year for the second month in a row, decreasing year over year by 5.7 percent. That\u2019s the widest negative margin all year, and a thorough correction from July, when new listings increased by 13.4 percent year over year.\n",

When asked about the overall project, 45 percent of respondents supported it, while 40 percent were opposed.\nIn August, Bexar County Commissioners voted to send the ballot items to voters in a proposal that could provide $500 million in visitor tax revenue for a new Spurs arena and renovations to the Frost Bank Center, the current home of the Spurs, should voters approve the measure.\nVoter-approved funds could also go to work on redeveloping the grounds of the Freeman Coliseum, a concert venue and home of the stock show and rodeo. Bexar County would contribute 25 percent of the cost and no more than $311 million to the project.\nSpurs Sports and Entertainment Chairman and Managing Partner Peter J. Holt has pledged $1 billion toward the projects: at least $500 million for the new arena, $500 million for adjacent development and $60 million for community incentives.\nThe Spurs also pledged to cover cost overruns. In late August the San Antonio City Council approved the continuation of\nCity Manager Erik Walsh\u2019s negotiations\nwith Spurs Sports on a term sheet.\n\nOpposition in the polling was stronger for the NBA team\u2019s proposed arena, with 46 percent of respondents saying they would vote against it and 15 percent undecided. About 41 percent opposed funding the rodeo expansion, which includes redeveloping the Frost Bank Center, the team\u2019s current home.\n\u201cSupport for ballot propositions is always very fluid,\u201d in a news release outlining the findings of the poll. \u201cThat said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the effort to secure venue tax funding for a new Spurs arena faces an uphill battle,\u201d said Bryan Gervais, UTSA political science professor and director of the\nresearch center\n.\nThe poll surveyed 660 likely Bexar County voters between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 using computer-assisted, self-interviewing software in English and Spanish. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.\nThe findings come as city leaders and Spurs ownership make their case for the new arena, arguing it would anchor a revitalized downtown district and attract more events year-round. The prospect of the project getting off the ground also renewed interest in downtown San Antonio\u2019s office market despite high vacancy rates near\n27 percent\n.\nCritics\n, meanwhile, question using public venue tax revenue for a facility that could primarily benefit the team.\nGervais said campaigns on both sides \u201chave plenty of room to move the needle.\u201d\n",

Mamdani pointed to data released in previous years that showed landlord profits on the rise.\nThe\nauthority\nto set annual rent increases for stabilized rents lies with the nine-member board, though mayors have\ninfluenced\nits decisions.\nThe board releases a report every year that suggests different potential rent increase ranges, based on different financial considerations. The final rent increases do not have to, and often do not, abide by those ranges. Landlord groups have long\ncriticized\nthe board\u2019s reports detailing rises in buildings\u2019 net operating income because those calculations include market-rate units.\nOne of the moderators, Politico New York\u2019s Sally Goldenberg, twice asked Mamdani if he was making a determination based on data he has not yet seen. Both times, he pointed to previous data.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the data year after year, of the fact that salaries are stagnating, costs are up, New Yorkers can\u2019t actually afford their apartments,\u201d he said.\nHe added that he would take action to help landlords with insurance, property taxes and water bills.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, repeatedly noted that Mamdani lives in a stabilized apartment and criticized the rent freeze proposals.\n\u201cFreeze the rent only postpones the rent because then you have to have an increase to cover the costs,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, the building is going to go bankrupt.\u201d\nWhen asked what he would do for renters who do not live in stabilized housing, Mamdani pointed to plans to build 200,000 units of \u201ctruly affordable homes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make it easier for the private sector to build housing in this city, because what we see today is, it\u2019s not labor, it\u2019s not materials, it\u2019s the wait that is often costing so many, so much to actually build the housing we need in this city,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite this promise to build more housing, Mamdani has not taken a position on three controversial\nballot questions\naimed at speeding up approval of affordable housing. Though moderators didn\u2019t ask about the measures, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa noted his opposition to and pointed out that Democratic leaders of the City Council also oppose the measures. He also said he is the only candidate who opposes zoning changes approved as part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\nWhen asked how he hopes to bring down costs in the city if he doesn\u2019t support the construction of new housing, Sliwa said office buildings in Manhattan should be converted for residential use.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go into the outerboroughs, you don\u2019t need to use wetlands or parklands,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you build a new building, it takes five years. If you convert an existing building, it can be done in a year.\u201d\nCuomo was asked about his proposal, dubbed \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d and\ncriticism\nthat it would require tenants to pay too much of their income toward rent. Under the proposed law, when a regulated apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent. Both tenant and landlord groups have criticized the proposal.\nCuomo, who repeatedly referenced that he served as secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the proposal is meant to ensure the units are reserved for the city\u2019s most rent-burdened.\nLater in the debate, the moderators asked the candidates how they would enforce the city\u2019s emissions law, Local Law 97.\nCuomo and Mamdani agreed that some owners will opt to pay the fine for non-compliance rather than invest in the building upgrades required to meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\u201cYes, I support the law, yes, we have to implement it, but we have to implement it in a way that is feasible,\u201d Cuomo said. He has\nreportedly\ntold a coalition of co-op boards that he is open to modifying the law to make compliance easier.\nMamdani said the city could help condo and co-op owners by buying green building technology in bulk. Sliwa indicated that he would slow the law\u2019s implementation.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is no longer involved in the Raleigh Miami Beach, the trophy asset he planned to redevelop into a luxury condo and hotel project.\nNew York-based Nahla Capital paid about $270 million for the three-acre property at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue, sources confirmed to The Real Deal.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported the sale. Nahla, a private equity firm with $2 billion in assets under management,\nwon a bid\nto purchase the project this summer, though Shvo had a right of first refusal and was reportedly working on raising new funds to pay off his partners and the debt backing the property.\nThe sale largely marks Shvo\u2019s exit from the Miami Beach market, where he made a splash when he and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds,\npaid $243 million\nfor the Raleigh assemblage in 2019, which includes the Richmond and South Seas hotels.\nShvo hired Peter Marino and Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design to design the Raleigh.\u00a0 The developer gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower on the beachfront site. The project includes 44 luxury condos, a private members\u2019 club and a hotel component. The Raleigh, an iconic Art Deco hotel known for its pool, was designed by L. Murray Dixon.\nMost presales were in the $5,000-plus per square foot range, though the Wall Street Journal reported that a unit was under contract for nearly $8,500 per square foot. The Raleigh struggled to compete with Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s nearby Auberge-branded condo and hotel redevelopment of the Shore Club.\nLast summer, Shvo\ncut ties with\nOfficial, the former Side-backed firm co-founded by Oren and Tal Alexander, after the Alexander brothers faced allegations of rape and sexual assault. Official was previously handling sales of the Raleigh. One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Anna Sherrill took over sales.\n\nIn 2023, the partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\noriginated by BH3 Management, and the firm had repeatedly extended the maturity date for the loan. A spokesperson for BH3 said that the loan was paid off in connection with this sale.\nA spokesperson for the Raleigh said that the partnership \u201chas chosen to sell the property to Nahla\u201d following its repositioning of the project.\nNewmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo arranged the sale.\nIn September, Shvo\nsold his Alton Road assemblage\n, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective via a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure.\nShvo still owns a portion of the development for his One Soundscape Park office project at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n",

The property is at 9703 Collins Avenue in\nBal Harbour\n.\nThe lender, San Francisco-based Column, is reviewing a request by Al Rayyan, led by CEO Tarek El Sayed, for an extension, Morningstar states.\nThough Al Rayyan maintained an above breakeven debt service coverage ratio, its 2024 net cash flow reportedly fell to about half of 2021 levels, potentially triggering tighter scrutiny from bondholders, the report shows.\n\nAl Rayyan\n, whose chairman Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani is a member of Qatar\u2019s ruling Al Thani family, obtained the loan in 2021, records show. The firm used the loan proceeds to pull out $44.5 million in equity and pay off a previous\n$132 million\nmortgage that had been acquired by London-based Reuben Brothers, led by billionaire siblings David and Simon Reuben.\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour is a condo-hotel completed in 2011 consisting of three 27-story towers with 192 hotel rooms and 205 condos. Al Rayyan acquired the hotel portion, which is housed in the complex\u2019s center tower, for $213 million in 2014 from billionaire Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.\nAl Rayyan also invested $40 million in renovations, loan filings show. Last year, the\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour Residences condo association\nsued Al Rayyan, alleging building defects, health and safety issues and financial mismanagement. The association is seeking a comprehensive assessment of the building and remediation for a laundry list of alleged issues in the complex, the pending complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court states.\nAlso in 2024, Al Rayan sold the ownership entity for the\nW Miami\n, a 50-story, 148-key hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, to a joint venture between Aventura-based BH Group and S\u00fczer Group. The price was not disclosed.",

        "content": "After years of work, a West Village megamansion is finally making its public debut with an asking price that could upend local records.\nThe 13,000-square-foot townhouse at\n105-107 Bank Street\nwas listed for $75 million, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. That works out to $5,769 per square foot for the Robert A.M. Stern Architects design.\nThe home features six bedrooms. The primary suite includes dual bathrooms, dressing rooms, a sitting room and private terrace. There\u2019s also a six-story floating staircase and a roof skylight.\nRoundSquare Builders acquired the separate walkups in 2021 and 2022 for a combined $18 million, though the firm didn\u2019t disclose how much construction cost over the succeeding years.. The company needed approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission before gutting the century-old properties.\nThe townhouse is revamped, but its history remains present: John Lennon and Yoko Ono lived at 105 Bank, while composer John Cage lived at 107 Bank. The rear of the house includes a spiral staircase refurbished and lifted from Lennon\u2019s apartment.\n\nThe downtown townhouse record fell only last year, when Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield and Away co-founder Jen Rubio bought a double-wide townhome\nfor $72.5 million\n.\nLeslie Garfield\u2019s Matthew Lesser has the listing. He refused showings and visits to the 40-foot-wide property until it was complete, reluctant to display anything less than a finished product.\nThe process of combining properties into a megamansion is controversial and can draw local opposition. Buildings that once housed multiple families become singular residences for a select few, seemingly in contrast to the housing shortage the city faces.\nCombining apartments or replacing small-unit multifamily buildings with oversized townhouses or large duplexes has cost the city\nmore than 100,000 homes\nover the decades. At one time, it was far more common for developers to convert single-family row houses into co-ops or multifamily rentals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A city of Miami board voted to approve a rezoning of a portion of the Jungle Island property, which Terra and ESJ Capital Partners\u2019 Ecoresiliency Miami plan to redevelop.\nMiami\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board voted to amend the existing Jungle Island special area plan and rezone about 5.4 acres of the nearly 19-acre site to T6-36 from T6-12. The rezoning still requires first and second reading approvals from the city commission at later, unspecified dates.\nDespite unanimous approval, board members raised concerns about parking, traffic and green space. The approval includes a condition that a parking study be completed.\nLast November, 62 percent of\nvoters approved\na charter amendment to redevelop Jungle Island. The joint venture between\nDavid Martin\n\u2019s\nTerra\nand ESJ will acquire the 5.4 acres that are currently part of the 13.3-acre Jungle Island property at 1111 Parrot Jungle Trail in Miami. The developers plan to build two up to 48-story luxury condo towers on the land they\u2019re buying from the city. Much of the existing waterfront Jungle Island theme park will become the $37 million public park paid for by the developers.\nThe assessed purchase price for the land that the developers are purchasing is $160 million, but the developers will provide much of that\nvia public benefits\n. At closing, Terra and ESJ will pay $10 million. They will also make annual payments to the city for 99 years, provide $20 million in public benefits, and $22 million to pay off a HUD loan to the Jungle Island property, according to a previous city meeting.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, board member Arthur Porosoff, a broker and developer, called the proposed 50 parking spaces \u201cfrustrating,\u201d and the larger discussion around parking a waste of time. He also said the planned public park was really a park for the 800 residents of the planned condominium component. He said the developers are \u201ctaking advantage of the people.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real,\u201d Porosoff said. \u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s a joke\u2026.This is an amenity for the building. I understand everybody gets paid a lot of dollars. I get paid big dollars. I\u2019m a developer. I like the story. I would hire you to tell the story, and I would hire you to convince them to agree with the story, but the fact of the matter is that this is not for the public. Am I going to vote for it? Yeah, I\u2019m a real estate guy. But the fact of the matter here is that this is a joke, and everybody knows it.\u201d\nPorosoff sought to extract more parking from the developer, but realized that the city no longer had leverage to do so.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, that\u2019s a moot point. You can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal was already struck, and it\u2019s a bad deal that we did, in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe developers\u2019 attorney, Iris Escarra, said the city\u2019s parks department will dictate the design used to build the park, as well as how much parking to include. But the parking will cut into the 13-plus acres of park space.\nBoard member Joseph Corral also pressed the developers\u2019 team on parking, as well as how people will access the park.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be skeptical,\u201d Corral said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, because if you would have told the people they were voting for a referendum to build [up to 48]-story towers, it would have never passed. But the park is really all we saw. We all saw the beautiful renderings.\u201d\nThe park\u2019s designer, Daniel Vasini of West Eight, called the park a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a great bicycle lane so you can come here by bike,\u201d Vasini said.\nCorral interrupted him: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being very serious,\u201d Vasini replied.\n\u201cHave you been on the MacArthur Causeway?\u201d Corral asked.\n",

        "content": "Less than a year after securing a trio of high-end tenants for a Gold Coast retail space, Fred Latsko is putting the property on the market.\nThe Chicago developer tapped Newmark brokers to sell the 4,200-square-foot building at 900 North Rush Street, which sits at the base of a 17-story condo tower at 40 East Delaware Place, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe space is fully leased to international\nfashion brands\n: California-based Rails, Danish label Ganni and Toronto jeweler Mejuri. The leases, announced late last year, marked a notable reactivation of a former Intermix boutique in one of Chicago\u2019s priciest retail corridors.\nLatsko declined to disclose an asking price, but a Newmark marketing brochure shows the tenants have a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years and collectively generate more than $1.5 million in annual net operating income, the outlet reported. The offering is being marketed by brokers\nKeely Polczynski\n, Conor Lalor, Kyle Minter, Brian Schneiderman, Eric Williams and Mat Adler.\nPersistently high borrowing costs have kept many investors sidelined. But the property\u2019s timing could benefit from renewed leasing momentum across Rush, Oak and Walton streets, where brands including Kith, Skims, Cartier and Brandy Melville have recently taken space.\n\nGanni\u2019s deal at 900 North Rush marked the brand\u2019s first Midwest location, while Latsko has also drawn Bottega Veneta to his nearby property at 41 East Oak Street. He refinanced that building, along with 900 North Rush and two others nearby, with a $34 million loan from JDI Realty in 2023 \u2014 less than a previous\n$43.6 million Loancore loan\n.\nLatsko\u2019s latest listing adds to a small but active pool of\nGold Coast\nretail trades, where strong tenant rosters have helped sellers push through interest-rate headwinds.\nInstitutional capital has largely retreated from the market, but long-term investors seeking trophy retail exposure continue to hunt in Chicago\u2019s luxury shopping areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The lenders will also provide an $89.4 million mezzanine loan, per the report, which appraises the 1.3 million-square-foot, 39-story trophy tower at nearly $2 billion.\nThe interest-only CMBS loan has a two-year term with three one-year extension options. Proceeds will go toward repaying\nprevious debt\n, including a $750 million loan from ING Group and a $300 million mezzanine loan from Apollo Global Management.\nThe blockbuster refi comes after Brookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 1950s building, formerly known as\n666 Fifth Avenue\n, putting on a new facade clad with glass panels, along with an upgraded lobby, amenity space, elevators and improved infrastructure to significantly reduce the carbon footprint.\nThe building, two blocks north of Rockefeller Center, hit\nfull occupancy\nin September, when Scotiabank inked a 205,000-square-foot lease, a major milestone for a property mired in controversy less than a decade ago.\n\nBrookfield purchased the 99-year ground lease from Kushner Companies\nin a $1.3 billion deal\n, raising questions about whether\nJared Kushner leveraged foreign policy connections\nto secure a bailout of the property (the Qatari government holds investments with Brookfield).\nIn May 2022, Australian financial services company Macquarie Group became the first tenant to sign on at the revamped property,\ntaking 250,000 square feet\n. Other tenants jumped on board soon after, including 400 Capital, Stephens and Viking.\nLate last year, Citadel agreed to\ntake 504,000 square feet\nat 660 Fifth, the second-largest lease of the second quarter in Manhattan. Citadel is expected to move into the tower in January, making it the building\u2019s largest tenant.\nBrookfield did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

The asking rent for the entire sixth floor of the building was $115 per square foot.\nJLL\u2019s Joseph Messina and Todd Stracci represented the tenant, while a JLL team including Paul Glickman, Alexander Chudnoff and Ben Bass represented the landlord.\nThe fate of Harvey\u2019s current space at Columbia Property Trust\u2019s 315 Park Avenue South is not yet known. Harvey expanded its presence at that property to 34,000 square feet just one year ago.\nThere\u2019s a definitive tech feel emerging at One Madison.

The cloud-based data analytics and software platform will occupy a portion of the third floor at the 1.4-million-square-foot Class A office tower, which hit 78 percent occupancy upon that lease.\nOn top of other recent leases, the building\u2019s occupancy exceeds 91 percent, according to\nSL Green\n.\n\nIBM and Coinbase also occupy space in the 27-story building, which spans a full block between Park and Madison Avenues, as well as East 23rd and East 24th Streets.

        "content": "A unit in a church-to-condo conversion dubbed The Abbey has blessed Fort Greene with a new price record.\nOriginally asking $3.85 million off-market, a bidding war pushed the purchase price of unit 9 to $4.07 million, with the buyer agreeing to cover $83,000 in transfer taxes, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jessica Peters, who is leading sales at the building with Daniel Fried. The purchase price includes a $20,000 storage unit.\nThe final price, including concessions for the 2,023-square-foot home, puts the deal at $2,052 per square foot, a new per-foot record in the neighborhood.\nThe three-bedroom home retained several original Gothic revival-style arched windows in the living room and bedrooms, with the bedrooms featuring circular stained glass above lancet arches.\nThe open-concept great room features a 20-foot vaulted ceiling that looks up to a hexagonal dome overhead. The side-by-side 36-inch Sub-Zero fridge and freezer are paneled into the wall, and the home comes with a library ladder to reach upper-level cabinetry.\nCompleted in 1888, the church was converted into rentals in 2016 before KSR Development scooped up the property for over $12 million in 2024 to turn it into luxury condos. Peters and Fried have sold eight of the 12 condos, including unit 10, which sits in the church\u2019s original bell tower, which was priced at $4 million. The building has a projected sellout of nearly $27 million, with studios starting at just under $1.4 million, one-bedrooms starting at $1.6 million and two-bedrooms beginning at $1.9 million.\n\nThe building also boasts some new-fangled amenities, including a fitness center and a sauna in the basement.\nPricing The Abbey proved to be a challenge in a neighborhood mostly filled with historic townhouses and brownstone condo conversions. Two units in the building couldn\u2019t even be appraised, according to Peters, who got an exception through one of her preferred lenders.\n\u201cNone of the comps showed us anything higher than $1,675, $1,700 a foot,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get to see something like this. So I think just our gut instinct was to price it the way we felt it should be priced, and it worked.\u201d\nThe previous record-holder in terms of price per square foot appears to be unit 4 at 242 Adelphi Street, which sold for $3.4 million in 2023, or $1,946 per square foot. The top-floor duplex in the converted townhouse went for nearly 30 percent over its asking price.\nEarlier this year, an unfinished five-story townhouse at 39 South Portland Avenue\nsold for $8.75 million in an all-cash deal\n, marking the priciest residential sale in Fort Greene. The $1,365 price per square foot of that sale still falls far short of the per-square-foot prices at The Abbey.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in Fort Greene is that buyers are willing to pay the price points for special things,\u201d Peters said.\n",

They will be relocated under the proposal, according to a filing in Delaware\u2019s bankruptcy court. The Seaquarium has been operational since 1954.\nTerra\u2019s Resilient Aquarium LLC plans to pump up to $100 million into renovating, modernizing and redeveloping the Seaquarium.

Miami-Dade County moved to evict the company last year, but the\neviction proceedings\nwere stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.\nThe county, and activists, have alleged the current operator failed to maintain the property in good repair and clean condition. Miami-Dade alleged that MS Leisure violated the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care.

        "content": "Private equity billionaire Greg Mondre dropped $58 million on an oceanfront lot in Palm Beach, after spec developer Brian Stock abandoned efforts to build a mansion on the property.\nMondre bought the 1.2-acre parcel at 965 North Ocean Boulevard from Stock\u2019s 965 North Ocean Boulevard LLC, sources confirmed. Listing sites show the deal has closed, but the deed has yet to appear in public records.\nLawrence A. Moens\nwith Lawrence A. Moens Associates had the listing, and Marley Overman with Illustrated Properties brought the buyer.\nMondre is co-CEO of the Menlo Park-based private equity firm Silver Lake. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.3 billion. He sits on the boards of GoodRx, Fanatics, Vantage Data Centers North America and media firm Red Ventures, according to Silver Lake\u2019s website. Ric Elias, the billionaire Red Ventures co-founder and CEO, sold his Palm Beach mansion for\n$73 million\nin March.\nIt\u2019s not Mondre\u2019s first Palm Beach purchase. Sources confirmed he was the hidden buyer in the\n$31 million\npurchase of the house at 1160 North Ocean Boulevard in March. Overman, along with Serhant\u2019s Gary Pohrer, has the listing for the home, which is being advertised as a teardown for $39.5 million, according to Zillow.\n\nRecords show Mondre also owns a home in the exclusive Lost Tree Village community in North Palm Beach. He bought the house at 11739 Lost Tree Way for $7.2 million in 2018, according to property records. That brings his total spend in Palm Beach County to at least $96.2 million.\nThe 1.2-acre lot at 965 North Ocean Boulevard has 150 feet of waterfront. Stock, who heads Naples-based Stock Development, bought the site for $34.2 million in 2021, according to property records. His efforts to build a spec mansion on the site stalled out after Palm Beach\u2019s Architectural Commission rejected proposed designs.\nMondre\u2019s neighbors on either side of the North Ocean Boulevard property will be Phillies owners John and Leigh Middleton, who bought their home at 947 North Ocean Boulevard for $19.3 million in 2010, and chemical heiress Nicole du Pont Limbocker at 977 North Ocean Boulevard, property records show.\nDeals are ramping up in Palm Beach as the island\u2019s busy season approaches. Earlier this month, billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart dropped\n$30 million\non a landmarked home on the island.",

Weingart allegedly used city and state Homekey dollars to complete the acquisition.\nTaylor reportedly hid a double-escrow deal from lenders. In another incident, he allegedly forged bank correspondence to secure financing, sending an email to a lender claiming to be an employee of another bank and falsely saying that the credit line with the bank had been closed.\nProsecutors say Taylor altered real bank statements, including tweaking the dollar amounts and bank account numbers to display millions of dollars in deposits that didn\u2019t exist.\nIn the second case, Cody Holmes allegedly fabricated balance sheets to obtain $25.9 million in Homekey funding for affordable housing developer Shangri-La Industries, then siphoned off millions to pay personal credit card bills and luxury expenses like jewelry, music festival tickets and a Beverly Hills mansion.\n\nMore than $2 million allegedly went from Shangri-La accounts to Holmes\u2019 personal American Express cards over six months.

At stake is $185 million in funding, which would make up about 13 percent of the Chicago agency\u2019s 2025-26 budget.\n\u201cThe HUD certifications cite several recent Executive Orders but provide no additional information or clarification on these requirements beyond the language in the application,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe CHA is also anticipating similar restrictions to future HUD allocations which could affect up to $1 billion in funding for the agency, which serves 135,000 Chicago residents. Local housing authorities typically get the majority of their funding from HUD.\nThe local agency is seeking a temporary restraining order.\n\u201cWe are asking the court to step in and provide guidance on the lawfulness of the conditions HUD is seeking to impose,\u201d said\nCHA Operating Chairman Matthew Brewer\nin the news release. \u201cThis intervention is a necessary last resort since our discussions with HUD have been limited due to the government shutdown.\u201d\nThe press release also noted that a similar case is ongoing in Rhode Island and requests that a judge consider the outcome of that litigation, as well.\nThe lawsuit landed amid leadership flux and political crosswinds for the CHA. Brewer, a commercial litigation attorney and longtime CHA board commissioner, was appointed as the agency\u2019s operating chairman in September after months of turbulence.\nMayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s pick to lead the CHA, former\n27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n, has been sidelined from assuming its CEO position, at least temporarily, since Brewer asked HUD to review Burnett\u2019s potential conflicts of interest tied to his three decades as a Chicago City Council member and ownership of three properties rented by CHA voucher holders.\nThe leadership churn comes during heightened scrutiny of the CHA board due to revelations that one of its members,\nDebra Parker\n, has family members and a boyfriend with businesses that have scored nearly $22 million in contracts with the agency in recent years.",

        "content": "Broadway\u2019s skyline could soon rise higher, despite neighborhood pushback.\nThe Chicago City Council approved a sweeping rezoning plan Thursday that will allow taller, denser developments and a wider mix of commercial uses along a 3-mile stretch of the corridor from Devon to Montrose avenues in\nEdgewater and Uptown\n, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nThe long-debated measure \u2014 passed after months of contentious public meetings and postponed votes \u2014 aims to spur housing and mixed-use projects along the Red Line in neighborhoods where prices have climbed sharply and affordability has eroded.\nSupporters say the plan will boost\nhousing supply\nand retail vitality along a key transit corridor. Opponents warn it could overwhelm neighborhood infrastructure and sideline residents in future development decisions.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian-street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\n\nMost of Broadway will shift to mixed-use community shopping district zoning, following community feedback about the larger lot sizes there. Their designation permits ground-floor retail with\napartments\nor condos above but restrict liquor and bar uses to cases approved through special-use permits.\nThe final version of the ordinance followed a heated neighborhood battle. One group,\nSave Edgewater\n, hired a lawyer and paid for billboards opposing the changes, warning they would usher in out-of-scale density. Pro-upzoning residents launched their own online campaign, petitions and even tongue-in-cheek flyers mocking resistance efforts.\nUnder the new rules, any\nproject\ntopping 80 feet or exceeding 100 residential units will still face a full planned development review, requiring public input and city approval. City planners framed the policy as a balance between enabling growth and preserving character.\nOfficials said the rezoning should make it easier to add housing and amenities near transit without piecemeal negotiations for each site, allowing for more predictability in development planning.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The price works out to $8.9 million per acre.\nThe 128-room Los Gatos Lodge, at 50 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road in Los Gatos, was built in 1936 and spans more than 46,000 square feet. The owner had an asking price of $100 million, or $781,250 per key, in 2022.\nThe town of\nLos Gatos\nsigned off on SummerHill\u2019s development proposal in March, which includes the demolition of the vintage motel and construction of a 155-unit residential community.\nThe development is planned as 28 three-story attached buildings with four to six for-sale townhome-style condominiums per building. Each unit would span between 1,300 and 2,200 square feet.\n\nSummerHill Homes will take advantage of the state density bonus, granting the developer the ability to skirt zoning restrictions and receive waivers for certain regulations if their developments include affordable units for very-low-income to moderate-income households. The firm will build 26 below-market-rate condos to meet that requirement. A household of four people in\nSanta Clara County\nis considered very-low-income with $100,450 annually.\n\u201cIt meets that state law requirement, and this is one of the better state law requirements that\u2019s coming to us,\u201d Los Gatos town councilmember Rob Rennie said of the plan.\nOn the other side of the Bay, in SummerHill\u2019s home city of San Ramon, the developer is building another residential community as part of\nBishop Ranch\u2019s transformation\nfrom office park to mixed-use community.\nThat development, a 404-townhome community called City Village, began construction in 2022 and will open next spring; units at the community have already been pre-sold.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

While parts of the peninsula now house a marina, single-family homes, a restaurant and an apartment complex, the central section \u2014 which included plans for a hotel, conference center and man-made lagoon \u2014 remains largely untouched.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing else that\u2019s happened,\u201d Winget said. \u201cThat heart of the development that was supposed to drive our tax base hasn\u2019t come to fruition.\u201d\n\nSapphire Bay\u2019s president declined to comment to KXAS, saying only that the company\u2019s attorneys were preparing a response to the city\u2019s notice.\nThe default marks the latest in a series of setbacks for the high-profile project. In 2023, a fire damaged the\nView at Sapphire Bay\n, a 400-unit apartment complex from Dallas homebuilder Zale Properties that was nearing completion, though some units have since opened.\nDespite the standoff,\nRowlett\nofficials insist the city\u2019s vision for a regional entertainment destination on Lake Ray Hubbard is intact. The area\u2019s zoning caps further residential development, forcing any future buildout to lean heavily on commercial and hospitality uses.\n\u201cWe still believe the peninsula is incredibly valuable,\u201d Winget said. \u201cWe want to see something really great go in there \u2014 whether it\u2019s with this developer or a different developer.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is demanding just over $20 million in unpaid principal plus interest, according to the filing in state Supreme Court.\n\nLast month, meanwhile, the smaller 700-square-foot cottage on Shinnecock Bay reappeared on the market with an $8.5 million ask.\nFuchs and Alvina Collardeau divorced in 2020 after eight years of marriage, putting homes in the Hamptons, Manhattan, Paris, Miami, Cap d\u2019Antibes on the French Riviera, Capri and London into play.\nTwo years later, a British High Court judge granted Collardeau a $44 million judgment. Another judge ordered the sale of the cottage last month after Collardeau alleged Fuchs was missing mandated payments.\nIn the spring, Citibank \u2014 which provided a $3.26 million mortgage to Fuchs for a prewar condo at 302 West 12th Street in the West Village \u2014 filed a\nforeclosure suit\nafter the RFR co-founder stopped making monthly payments in May 2024, according to the complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court.\nThe lender is calling for the sale of the 1,000-square-foot pad, which Fuchs bought from comedian Seth Meyers in 2018.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bastion\u2019s other South Florida concepts are the two-Michelin-starred L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and the Michelin-starred Le Jardinier in the Miami Design District.\nThe 178-seat Seia restaurant and the Seia club, with interiors designed by Zervudachi, Roberts and Macadam, are expected to open next year, the release says. The venue also will have an exclusive caf\u00e9 for tenants.\n830 Brickell tenants will receive Seia club invitations, with membership costing a $25,000 initiation fee and $5,000 in annual dues, according to the Bastion spokesperson.\n\nOKO and London-based Cain International, led by Jonathan Goldstein, finished development of 830 Brickell last year at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year completion delay. It is the first standalone office building in the Brickell Financial District in more than a decade.\nThe tower reaped a\nleasing bonanza\ndue to its fortunate timing: It was under construction during the pandemic-era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, many of whom sought top tier office spaces and signed up for space at 830 Brickell. The tower is fully leased.\nTenants include law firms Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Sidley Austin, Microsoft, insurance firms Marsh and A-Cap, and financial services firm Corient (previously called CI Financial). Also, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel and Citadel Securities have offices at 830 Brickell, after Griffin moved the firms\u2019 headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022.\nThe Seia restaurant and club announcement comes after a previously planned hospitality concept at 830 Brickell fizzled out.\nIn December, OKO and Tao Group Hospitality said they will open a Mediterranean restaurant and\nclub with a members-only loung\ne on the top two floors. At some point after that, the firms nixed the project. Tao is led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss.",

        "content": "Austin planners are scrambling to recalibrate downtown development rules after a new state law stripped cities of their power to regulate density.\nSenate Bill 840, which took effect in\nSeptember\n, bans local limits on floor-to-area ratios for residential projects \u2014 a change that upends the city\u2019s long-standing system for shaping growth in the\nCentral Business District\n, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBefore the\nlaw\n, Austin used FAR caps to control size and density downtown, requiring developers to join the Downtown Density Bonus Program if they wanted to go bigger. The program traded extra height and density for public benefits such as affordable housing units or financial contributions to housing funds.\nWithout FAR restrictions, planners say the density program could lose its leverage \u2014 unless the city imposes new height limits.\n\u201cWe have to put in a height limit to make the Downtown Density Bonus Program continue to work,\u201d city planner Alan Pani said during a Planning Commission meeting.\nCity staff proposed a 350-foot height cap for Central Business District projects, with anything taller required to go through the density-bonus program.\nBut the Planning Commission recommended doubling the limit to 700 feet for projects in downtown\u2019s core and the Rainey Street area to maintain developer flexibility and avoid stifling growth. The final decision will rest with the City Council.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us miss out on additional density, more riders for transit, more tax revenue and more neighbors,\u201d Commissioner Danielle Skidmore said.\nAustin\u2019s skyline already soars well above those thresholds.\n\nOnly three towers top 700 feet. The 74-story Waterline, a Lincoln Property and Kairoi Residential project slated to deliver 352 luxury apartments next year stands at 1,021 feet. Meta\u2019s\nSixth and Guadalupe\nreaches 875 feet. And\nThe Republic\nstands at\n710 feet\n.\nThe median height for projects erected since 2017 has been north of 350 feet. Last year, it averaged just over 500 feet, according to city data.\nDevelopers say taller projects are inevitable and economical.\nUrbanspace CEO Kevin Burns\ntold the outlet that shrinking land availability favors vertical construction, with \u201coptimal efficiency\u201d for towers slightly above 600 feet.\n\u201cGoing taller gets expensive fast,\u201d Burns said, citing the higher costs for concrete, elevators and fire suppression systems.\nCity officials hope a new framework will preserve Austin\u2019s density incentives and downtown momentum without running afoul of state law.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Coca-Cola Building, built in 1939, was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1975.\nReyes Coca-Cola Bottling, which operates out of the building and distributes the soda to the West Coast and Midwest, plans to restore the exterior of the nearly century-old structure and remodel the interior for continued use.\nThe building will also receive a new rooftop deck ahead of upcoming international sporting events in the city.

The bank alleges the group hid the fact that some of the collateral properties were already in foreclosure, in turn undermining the bank\u2019s repayment rights.\nMOM CA Investco was launched in 2021 by Mohammad Honarkar and Mahender Makhijani. At the time, Makhijani acquired and managed distressed real estate for investors through an entity called Continuum Analytics. Marcil and Stupin were among Continuum\u2019s largest investors, while Shyam is its legal owner.\n\nThe relationship fell apart after Honarkar accused his partners of fraud. Makhijani at one point used armed guards to take over some of the properties and reportedly hired mobile billboards to drive around\nLaguna Beach\ndisplaying pictures of Honarkar and accusing him and two city employees of corruption.\nThe firm\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, which covered a hotel in Laguna Beach and a $65 million apartment complex in Redlands, was dismissed in August after the parties failed to reach a restructuring deal.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is keeping a close eye on the market as regional banks are tied to borrowers accused of fraud.\n\u201cMy antenna goes up when things like that happen,\u201d Dimon told analysts on a call this week,\nper\nCNN. \u201cAnd I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more\u2026 Everyone should be forewarned on this.\u201d\nMarcil and Stupin contest the charges.\n\u201cMy clients vehemently deny all the allegations of wrongdoing,\u201d Brandon Tran, an attorney representing Marcil and Stupin, told Bloomberg. \u201cThese claims are unfounded and misrepresent the facts. We are confident that once all the evidence is presented, our clients will be fully vindicated.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But so far, no takers.\nThe potential seizure would mark another blow to Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion Lincoln Yards vision, which won City Council approval in 2019 but has since stalled amid shifting market conditions.\nEarlier this year, Sterling Bay surrendered the northern portion of the project site to Bank OZK to settle another outstanding loan.

Instead, it sat vacant for more than a year as Chicago\u2019s fledgling life sciences scene has clustered in more established neighborhoods like Fulton Market and the Illinois Medical District.\nMarketing materials from Eastdil Secured and Savills tout the property as a \u201cblank slate\u201d for an anchor tenant seeking modern lab or office space.\nBank OZK\nexecutives have hinted they\u2019re open to repositioning the property.\n\u201cGetting a user in the space to pay rent is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d president Brannon Hamblen told analysts, noting that the bank could repurpose funds earmarked for lab buildouts toward traditional office tenants instead.\nThe lender wrote down about $5.1 million on the debt, which now carries a $59 million balance after applying reserves, according to the filing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Globe Life is looking to offload its old\nMcKinney\nheadquarters, adding another large block of space to a high-vacancy Dallas\u2013Fort Worth office market.\nThe insurance giant listed its former 300,000-square-foot office building at 3700 South Stonebridge Drive, a 22-acre property, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe listing went live in late September, a couple of months after it bought a headquarters building in McKinney, and the company is already fielding early interest, said Jennifer Haworth, Globe Life\u2019s chief marketing officer.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Campbell Puckett, Ryan Hoopes, Matthew Murphy, Russell Ingrum, Todd Savage, Jared Chua and Kelsey Shebay are marketing the property. A formal call for offers is expected next month.\nThere\u2019s no asking price, but the site\u2019s scale and flexibility could attract a single corporate user or a redevelopment play. The Colin Central Appraisal District assessed the building\u2019s\ntaxable value\nat $51 million. It was constructed in 1995 and extensive upgrades were logged in 2007.\n\u201cIn this part of the metroplex, there are not many 300,000-square-foot vacancies available, and there are not any available options that come with this much excess land,\u201d Haworth told the outlet. \u201cThe location is best suited to attract a large single user, rather than a mix of tenants.\u201d\n\nThe sale followed Globe Life\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to\n7677 Henneman Way\nthis summer, a 200,000-square-foot office the firm purchased in July from Florida-based SouthState Corp. That building, 4 miles north of the Stonebridge site, is part of the former Independent Bank campus that SouthState acquired earlier this year for $2 billion.\nGlobe Life will relocate more than 3,000 employees to the new building by year\u2019s end.\nThe\nStonebridge\nproperty\u2019s listing adds to a wave of major suburban office availability across the metroplex. Other large campuses up for grabs include the former JCPenney headquarters in Plano, American Airlines\u2019 previous campus in Fort Worth, and ExxonMobil\u2019s old Irving property.\nThe region now has roughly 62 million square feet of vacant office space, with another 2 million under development, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Clearly, Marc Holliday wasn\u2019t interested in another defeat this fall.\nSpeaking of casino bids, one of the few to move on to the next round of the process suddenly tossed its cards this week.\nMGM Resorts \u2014 considered a shoo-in for one of three casino licenses \u2014\nwithdrew its proposal\nfor a $2.3 billion expansion of its facility in Yonkers.\nThe gaming giant blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d noting the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nMGM also relied on receiving an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state last week, the Yonkers proposal would only qualify for 15 years.\nThe Queens Aqueduct, Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park in Flushing and Bally\u2019s Bronx project are all that remain. The state does not have to award all three available licenses, meaning the competitors can\u2019t start counting their chips just yet.\n\nIn other news, a lender is\npursuing\ntwo non-judicial foreclosures on equity interests tied to two phases of Fordham Landing, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development along the Harlem River in the Bronx. Dynamic Star, led by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, is developing the megaproject with Namdar and Gorjian Acquisitions.\nA mysterious lender alleges debts are owed on a $55.1 million loan tied to 320 West Fordham Road, as well as $18.9 million tied to a loan for 2371 Exterior Street, 2391 and 2401 Exterior Street and 2444 Exterior Street.\nTwo foreclosure auctions are scheduled for Dec. 2.\nWhile Fordham Landing is facing threats, the Brooklyn Mirage\nappears doomed\n. The East Williamsburg building\u2019s owner filed for a demolition permit for at least part of the live music venue, part of a bigger space called Avant Gardner. The application is for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet.\nThe demolition would be the culmination of a tumultuous series of months, which included canceled shows, bankruptcy filings and overrun renovation costs.\nOn the culture beat, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is getting involved in its own real estate wheeling and dealing.\nThe museum\nsigned a deal\nto sell a pair of townhomes on East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side last asking $28 million. The buyer signed a contract two weeks after the homes went up for sale and plans to convert them into one single-family residence.\n",

The buyer was a trust. Humer, CFO at Boston-based biotechnology research firm Foghorn Therapeutics, paid $8.9 million for the pad in 2016; it went on the market in May with an asking price of $17.5 million. The 3,300-square-foot condo has four bedrooms, three and a half baths and a balcony. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nNoble Black, Justin Figari\nand\nConnor Cuccinelli\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe sale of a hotel off Madison Square Park was the top commercial deal recorded in the city. Arcadia, California-based developer\nKam Sang Co.,\npaid $231 million for the 252,000-square-foot hotel at\n5 Madison Avenue\nknown as the Edition Clocktower Hotel. The seller was the\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority\n, which had purchased the 273-key building in 2015 for $337 million.\nHudson Bay Capital Management\nprovided a $155 million mortgage for the purchase.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nMD2 Property Group\noffloaded two apartment buildings at\n4 West 108th Street\nand\n8 West 108th Street\nin Manhattan Valley for $17.5 million. The buyer was Los Angeles-based\nBando Geny 3 LLC.\nThe adjacent properties stand six stories tall and have 48 apartments combined.\nKEB Hana Bank\nprovided a $10.7 million loan. The seller had owned the properties since 2019, when they purchased them for $11 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Financial District, a 12-story office property traded for $40.2 million. LLCs tied to\nRobert Wolf\nand\nAM Property Holdings Corp.\n, led by\nPaul Wasserman\n, had owned the building for decades. The new owner is\nCSC 75 Maiden Prop Co LLC,\nregistered to a Columbus Avenue address.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nEtsy CEO\nJoshua Silverman\nand\nShirin Ghotbi\nsold a condo overlooking the Museum of Natural History at\n101 West 78th Street\nin the Upper West Side.\nVitaly Kuznetsov\n, an algorithm developer at Hudson River Trading, and\nMasayo Oto\ndropped $8.4 million on the unit, which Silverman and Ghotbi had bought in 2018 for $10.5 million. The four-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot pad had a most recent asking price of $8.7 million.\nPamela D\u2019Arc\nof Compass represented the sellers.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Rit Venerus\n, founder of Cal Financial Group, scooped up a sponsor unit at\n35 Hudson Yards\nfor just under $7 million. The unit spans about 2,700 square feet and has three bedrooms and three and a half baths.

        "content": "The gloves are coming off for house hunters in Brooklyn.\nLast month, one in four homes in the borough sold for more than its asking price \u2014 a metric typically indicating a property traded after a bidding war. Of the 10 New York City neighborhoods with the highest share of homes sold over asking, six were in Brooklyn, according to a\nStreeteasy report\npublished Thursday.\nHeightened competition among buyers is a natural next step for the borough\u2019s residential market, where\nprices have been climbing\nsince pandemic changes drove up demand. Brooklyn logged nearly 500 inked deals in September, up 11 percent from the same period last year.\nSome high-profile buyers have even swapped their Manhattan homes for pads in Brooklyn, setting new records. Last year, Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, paid\n$22 million\nfor a Brooklyn Heights townhouse just five months after buying a Greenwich Village abode for $18 million, which they subsequently put back on the market.\nProspect Heights claimed the largest share of homes selling over asking, at 47 percent. The median asking price was $1.3 million. Earlier this year, Redfin labeled the neighborhood, along with the adjacent Clinton Hill,\nthe most desirable\nin the country. The number of home sales in the enclave doubled in a year.\nNext up was Park Slope with 44 percent of homes selling above their asking prices. A townhouse at 535 First Street broke neighborhood records last month when Jared Vinik, the son of Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik, bought it for\n$14 million\n.\nBoth Park Slope and Prospect Heights ranked higher in homes with above-ask closing prices than some desirable Manhattan enclaves, including the\nWest Village\nand Greenwich Village.\nRounding out the top five on Streeteasy\u2019s list was Brooklyn Heights, long recognized for its pricey townhomes, where 33 percent of homes sold over asking. The other Brooklyn neighborhoods included were Crown Heights, Williamsburg and Sheepshead Bay.\nAcross the five boroughs, the residential market is heading into the fourth quarter on a promising note. More than 1,700 homes found buyers last month, up 10 percent from year-ago numbers, and the highest total for September since 2021.\n\nSo far, it appears supply is keeping up with demand, with roughly 4,600 homes hitting the market last month, marking a 10 percent increase from last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nJust what the West Village needs: another double-wide townhouse.\nA whopping 13,000-square-foot home in the neighborhood\nhit the market\non Friday with a $75 million price tag. If it trades for that price, it will set a new record for Downtown Manhattan, displacing another megamansion that sold for $73 million just last year.\nBefore the home at 105-107 Bank Street was combined into one, each side of the monster residence housed its own storied residents, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono and composer John Cage.\nThe creation of these massive single-family residences has drawn criticism, especially in recent years, as the city grapples with a housing crunch. In Manhattan, researchers found that for each of these combinations, the borough lost between six and seven housing units.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a penthouse at 111 West 56th Street, which sold for $12.3 million, or $4,400 per square foot. The condo, which hit the market last April asking just under $15 million, has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and two terraces.\nUnit PHC is one of 99 condos atop the\nThompson Central Park Hotel\n. Amenities at the development, known as One11 Residences, include a fitness center, private lounge and access to the hotel\u2019s concierge service.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Maria Mainieri, Taylor Middleton and Peter Evangelidis are heading sales for the developer, GFI Capital Resources.",

        "content": "A restaurateur signs a 15-year lease, then has a debilitating stroke. What happens next plays out in two very different versions, depending on who\u2019s telling the story.\nWhen Keith McNally suffered a major stroke in 2016, the famed restaurateur behind Pastis, Balthazar and Minetta Tavern feared his career and his body had collapsed for good. To make matters worse, the man who once ruled New York\u2019s dining scene suddenly found himself trapped in a business deal he could no longer execute. He\u2019d leased a Meatpacking District space to reopen his iconic restaurant Pastis, backed by a $1 million personal guarantee.\nIn his memoir \u201cI Regret Almost Everything,\u201d McNally recounts the episode as a near-tragic twist. Unable to walk or speak clearly, McNally put his daughter Sophie in charge of the business. He says she begged the landlords, Aurora Capital\u2019s Bobby Cayre and Jared Epstein, to release him from the lease. They refused, he wrote, at the urging of a mysterious \u201cthird partner,\u201d later identified as William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s Neil Bender. Facing financial strain and depression, McNally describes feeling cornered.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly afford to lose a million dollars, yet I was in no condition to build a restaurant,\u201d he wrote.\nEpstein tells a very different story. In his version, there was no threat to execute the guarantee, no heartless landlord tightening the screws on an ailing tenant.\n\u201cWe were never going to go after his personal guarantee,\u201d Epstein said in a phone interview. \u201cForget it being not a good thing to do as a business person. I believe it\u2019s a terrible thing to do as a human being \u2014 to prey on someone after they had a terrible medical problem in their life.\u201d\nAccording to Epstein, Sophie reached out soon after her father\u2019s health crisis to say she would carry the project forward. But when their investor pulled out, she needed time to find new funding. Rather than push back, Epstein said, Aurora worked with the McNallys to find potential partners. One of those introductions, to restaurateur Stephen Starr, ultimately revived the project. Starr partnered with McNally to reopen Pastis in 2019, to instant acclaim and two stars from The New York Times.\nFollowing the restaurant\u2019s success, McNally and Starr went on to open locations in Miami and Washington, D.C.\nEpstein said he was especially miffed by McNally\u2019s description of him in the book as \u201cobnoxious.\u201d He suspects the jab stems from a later clash, when he privately messaged McNally after the restaurateur posted something \u201cvery insensitive\u201d on Instagram following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel, he said.\nFor Epstein, the book\u2019s portrayal of events feels like misplaced resentment.\n\u201cWe saved his legacy brand,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cInstead of vengeance, he should actually be sending us flowers thanking us.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Rhode Island-based MCM just\nsold a portfolio\nof four nonunion Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million to a group of institutional investors, the largest Big Apple hotel sale since the\nSafe Hotels Act\nwent into effect in May. Before the bill passed, critics warned that its staffing mandates could cripple many of the city\u2019s hotels, driving up overhead and eroding their value. In the end, was it all much ado about nothing? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJPMorgan is requiring employees to provide an iris or fingerprint scan to access its new, $3 billion Manhattan headquarters, the\nFinancial Times reported\n. The bank is also requiring employees to use a mobile app to access the building\u2019s services, giving the bank an unprecedented amount of personal data on each of the 10,000 employees expected to be working at the building by the end of the year.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2013 New York City has halted its plan to add dedicated bus lanes along 34th Street after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding and approvals for other transit projects, according to\nThe New York Times\n. The Federal Highway Administration said the pause was prompted by concerns about the project\u2019s impact on trucks and emergency vehicles. The lanes are expected to speed up service for 28,000 daily riders by up to 15 percent.\n\u2013 Former financier Howard Rubin\u2019s estranged wife, Mary Henry, urged a judge to release the accused sex trafficker on a $50 million bond, describing him as a devoted grandfather, the\nNew York Post\nreported. In a court letter, she said Rubin, 70, should be free to spend time with his three young grandchildren while awaiting trial.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$15.9 million\nfor a 3,251-square-foot condominium at The Greenwich Lane, 155 West 11th Street in the West Village. Noble Black, formerly with Douglass Elliman, had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$231.2 million\nfor The New York Edition hotel at 5 Madison Avenue in Flatiron. The property has 252,109 square feet and 51 stories.\nThe Real Deal\nwrote about\nthis and another recent hotel transaction.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,156-square-foot condo unit at 445 Lafayette Street in Noho. Zack Sosne and Craig Roth with NextStop NY have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 24,785-square-foot, seven-story mixed-use project at 172-10 Jamaica Avenue. Mosharraf Hossain filed the permit on behalf of developer Gouranga Kundu.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

In hot spots like Mission Bay, near\nOpenAI\n\u2019s headquarters, rents climbed 13 percent recently.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d said Will Goodman, a principal at\nStrada Investment Group\n, which developed the luxury complex where Cluely leased. Half of the 501-unit complex\u2019s units were leased within two months of its May opening, he told the outlet.\n\nLines are forming around the block for apartment showings, with some renters flashing cash deposits on the spot. Last month, rent prices in the city\nsurpassed pre-pandemic highs\n.\nFor service workers and younger professionals, the crush is pushing affordability out of reach.\nRenters like Caroline Roche, a 25-year-old demand planner at Backroads, toured 25 apartments in a week to find a one-bedroom within her budget. Others have resorted to guerrilla tactics, such as posting flyers with their photos and phone numbers on telephone poles, to land a lease.\nIt\u2019s not just renters who are feeling the pinch of high demand and high prices.\nBuyers looking for luxury homes in San Francisco are having a\nharder time than ever to find mansions\n, as sales for those pricey abodes are up 14 percent year-over-year, while inventory is down 4.5 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm would have to pay the full amount to stave off a foreclosure auction.\nScape bought the SoFA site in 2020 for $16.5 million and landed the Madison Realty Capital financing the following year to build The Fay.\nThe tower opened late last year, adding residences to the district largely known for retail, restaurant, nightlife and entertainment. The project was hailed by\nSan Jose Mayor Matt Mahan\n, who said it would be the first of several high-rises needed to sustain the city\u2019s downtown revival.\n\n\u201cA big part of our success has to be residential density,\u201d Mahan said at the opening last December. \u201cThis is the first residential high-rise building we\u2019ve seen in a few years, and it certainly is not the last.\u201d\nThe foreclosure threat speaks to the troubles that\nBay Area multifamily developers\nhave faced in recent years, including high interest rates and construction cost inflation.\nCity officials are hopeful that completed towers like The Fay will help fuel the pedestrian and retail energy they envision for the South of First Area.\nIf\nMadison Realty Capital\nproceeds with the foreclosure, it would likely take possession of the building, potentially at a steep discount to replacement cost.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Hillwood started Alliance 35 years ago as a cargo airport, now owned by the City of Fort Worth, and it grew into a mixed-use logistics hub with everything from a retail town center to soundstages for prolific \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan.\nPerot warned that tariffs and overregulation could hold Texas back from \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d and he hinted that the U.S. Chamber\u2019s lobbying helped persuade President Donald Trump to put a\n90-day pause\non his initial tariff plan.\nPoliticians aren\u2019t always speaking to reality regarding tariffs and immigration, Perot said.\n\n\u201cThey know the immigration problem, they know the tariff problem, and they\u2019re all working hard to try to get it fixed,\u201d Perot said,\naccording to\nthe Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cBackstage, they know it. Onstage, you might get rhetoric, but our job at the chamber is to really work pure data backstage. And we\u2019re trusted by the elected officials. If we tell them something, they\u2019re going to know this isn\u2019t PR spin.\u201d\nPerot was early on Taylor Sheridan as well.\nSheridan has already filmed scenes from \u201cLandman\u201d in Alliance buildings undergoing a\n$65 million conversion\nto filming studios. Their deal was years in the making as Perot was bullish on Sheridan from the get-go.\n\u201cYou have a Fort Worth citizen, Taylor Sheridan, and his shows really do resonate with the Texas crowd and the U.S. crowd, and it\u2019s just a fluke we have him,\u201d Perot said in a talk to real estate students at\nTexas Christian University\nthis week.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said: \u2018This guy generates so much activity. How do we embrace him as a city? How do we have filming here? And where will it go?\u201d\nMansion goes to auction\nThe softening luxury real estate market in North Texas led the sellers of a house in McKinney to\nbring it to auction\nto find a buyer. The Collin County house, last listed for $4.5 million, is owned by members of a car club and has a 6,500-square-foot auto showroom.\nHouston office market perks up\nDemand for office is picking up in Houston, which logged positive absorption for the second straight quarter.

        "content": "Will\nSenate Bill 79\nbe the new builder\u2019s remedy for developers? It appears that it could be.\nThis may be why there was a scramble by the city of Los Angeles to push back on the transit-oriented housing bill after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law last week. Much like builder\u2019s remedy, SB 79 provides the key to streamlined development, pushing through higher density residential developments at a faster clip. In SB79\u2019s case, the law uses proximity to a transit stop, whereas builder\u2019s remedy requires a city to be out of compliance with its housing element (a masterplan for future housing development).\nThe Los Angeles City Planning Department published\ndraft maps\nof the blocks that could be impacted by SB 79.\nThe new law allows for multifamily residential of as high as nine stories and as many as 160 units for parcels closest to a high traffic transit stop, considered a \u201ctier 1\u201d station under the law. In the case of tier two stations, a maximum height of eight stories and 140 units is allowed.\nCity Planning counted 33 stations in Los Angeles that can be categorized as tier 1 and another 117 tier 2 stations.\nCities have until July 1, 2026, when the new law goes into effect, to sort things out.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s Beverly Hills move\nIt wasn\u2019t casino-related news, although there\u2019s a story for that elsewhere on\nThe Real Deal\n. Instead,\nSteve Cohen\nmade news of another kind when his Beverly Hills mansion, which is seeking $35 million, topped last week\u2019s Los Angeles County homes that went into contract.\nThe New York Mets billionaire owner has been in the news cycle for some time with his proposed $8 billion casino complex plans for 50 acres of parking next to Citi Field in New York. The project\u2019s still in the running for a state gaming license.\nHis home at 901 Oxford Way was purchased back in 2015 from spec developer Gala Asher, making Cohen and his wife Alexandra Cohen the Beverly Hills property\u2019s first and only residents.\nThe $10 million haircut on the ask underscores the challenges some are seeing in L.A.\u2019s high end, where price slashing and re-lists have become common.\n\nOn again, off again\nSpeaking of high-end problems, the market\u2019s recently seen a few re-lists of some pricey pads.\nThat includes billionaire Jeff Greene\u2019s 53,000-square-foot estate at\n9505 Lania Lane\n, which is back on the market for $195 million, or $3,679 per square foot. The last time Greene tried to sell the home was in 2017 for the more value-priced ask of $129 million. After it went off the market, it served as a rental.\nCount the\nWinnick estate\n, also known as Casa Encantada, as another boomerang listing.\nThe Bel-Air home at 10644 Bellagio Road re-entered the market last week for $190 million. That\u2019s down from the $250 million listing price Karen Winnick and her late husband and billionaire financier Gary Winnick originally asked back in 2023. The price was later slashed to $195 million and then, late last year, was cut to $165 million for the 60-room estate.\nNicki Minaj\u2019s debt prob\nA Holmby Hills home owned by\nNicki Minaj\ncould soon be on the market.\nChatter over the proposed sale stems from the rapper and her husband Kenneth Petty\u2019s refusal to pay a reported $503,000 award to security guard Thomas Weidenmuller, according to\nUS Weekly\n.\nWeidenmuller\u2019s now asked a judge to compel the couple to sell their home to not only address what he is owed, but also take care of the mortgage and liens on the property that amount to nearly $14 million.\nThe hip-hop star paid $19.5 million for the 11-bed, 16-bath home at 5510 Jed Smith Road about three years ago.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Board President\nToni Preckwinkle\nis displaying some familiarity with an old real estate adage: possession is nine-tenths of the law. The county owns a lot of land, and she made a move Thursday that could characterize federal agents as trespassers, should they engage in certain immigration enforcement activity.\nA few hours after Preckwinkle signed an executive order banning\nICE operations\non county property, she again touted the capacity of real estate dealmaking to shape politics, albeit in a much different arena.\nThe takeaway: Preckwinkle understands how to wield real estate as a tool for creating, maintaining and checking power.\nWhether she and other Chicago public officials properly use the tool is up for debate, of course. Take\nDavid Doig\n, who shared the stage with Preckwinkle late Thursday night as they each accepted awards in front of over 200 industry professionals at the annual Marshall Bennett Institute of Real Estate gala in developer Jeff Shapack\u2019s Fulton Market office building at 167 North Green Street.\nPreckwinkle lamented that Chicago housing development had fallen to low levels in recent years, which has sent rents skyrocketing to the fastest rates of growth in the nation.\nBut the optics of the event grow more complex when one scans Doig\u2019s real estate philosophies. The developer-activist behind the firm Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives has real estate credentials anchoring him firmly in the trenches where policy meets capital. And he\u2019s been outspoken about what he views as a broken process for financing affordable housing that has driven up costs at some projects\ncloser to $1 million per unit\n, far more than the price at which the private development market can produce.\n\nDoig\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints in former Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s city planning department, oversight of park district projects and development leveraging New Markets Tax Credits, showcasing a deep and practical engagement with the real estate sector.\nIn a\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\nopinion piece, he argued that the city needs a \u201chomebuilding revolution\u201d to offset decades of underproduction. He frames the issue not simply as a lack of subsidized housing but as systemic supply constraints: red tape, zoning inertia, capital stack complexity and developer risk must be rethought. He observes that building more middle-market units (with minimal public subsidy) may help \u201csoak up\u201d demand and ease pressure.\nLikewise, a\nChicago Tribune editorial\non \u201cHow ill-conceived \u2018affordable\u2019 housing becomes unaffordable\u201d critiqued programs that inadvertently drive up costs through overregulation or misaligned incentives. While not authored by Doig, the piece echoes his criticism of subsidy complexity and questions whether government-backed projects can remain affordable under heavy compliance burdens.\nAt the gala, juxtaposing Preckwinkle and Doig was not random. It showcased dueling yet potentially complementary narratives: Preckwinkle as a political boundary-setter, Doig as a policy implementer. But the contrast also sharpens doubts. If Preckwinkle\u2019s sanctuary county order stakes moral territory, Doig\u2019s work reminds us that real change requires negotiating markets, finance, regulation and on-the-ground execution.\nStill, linking them also raises tension: can a leader publicly decry suppressed housing starts while simultaneously endorsing a symbolic anti-ICE order whose enforcement is uncertain? Doig\u2019s presence offers a foil: development pragmatism facing political idealism.\nThe larger question lingers: will sanctuary-style orders meaningfully reshape immigrants\u2019 lived security \u2014 or will they serve chiefly as rallying flags? And can developers like Doig, pushing for a supply breakthrough, overcome the structural inertia that keeps Chicago undershooting housing demand?\nAt the gala, the award winners themselves told a story of converging aspirations \u2014 but whether Chicago gains homes, equity or protection depends on what happens when the impact of rhetoric fades.",

        "content": "San Francisco home sellers\naren\u2019t riding the discount wave seen in other markets nationwide.\nWhile sellers across the country are slashing list prices to attract interested buyers, only 12 percent of listings in the San Francisco metro area saw price cuts in August. By contrast, the national figure is around 17 percent.\nAt that rate, San Francisco claims the third-lowest share among major U.S. metros, behind New York and Newark, New Jersey. Overall, two-thirds of single-family homes ended up selling above list price in August, marking the highest rate in the Bay Area. Sellers in San Francisco who do slash prices usually only reduce by about 6 percent, or $100,000.\nThe median home price hovered around $1.2 million, or $100,000 below pre-pandemic levels. Typical homes spent a median of 42 days on the market.\nLuxury sales\ntell an even more bullish story.\nSales of homes priced above $5 million jumped 55 percent year-over-year in September, while total home sales rose 35 percent. The jump can likely be attributed to the influx of high-paid tech workers and executives, especially in the booming artificial intelligence sector.\nA\n$42 million off-market deal\nfor a 7,300-square-foot mansion in Pacific Heights, for example, blew past this year\u2019s previous record of $30 million. That home was sold to HOS Pacific, a limited liability company linked to Katie Schwab Paige, daughter of famed financier Charles Schwab. The same LLC owns another Pacific Heights home belonging to Katie Schwab Paige and her husband Matt Paige.\nWith limited supply and deep-pocketed buyers, sellers are sticking to their numbers. Even with flat year-over-year prices, the market\u2019s competitive streak and a record-breaking luxury tier shows that in San Francisco, waiting it out might still pay off.\nNeuralink\u2019s new digs\nNeuralink is in the midst of a brain \u2014 or rather, office \u2014 blast.\nElon Musk\u2019s cybernetic implant startup is\nexpanding in the Bay Area\nwith a 144,000-square-foot office at 499 Forbes Boulevard in South San Francisco. The site, vacant since biotech firm InterVenn Biosciences left in 2023, sits across from Genentech\u2019s $5 billion campus redevelopment.\nThough Musk\u2019 moved Tesla and SpaceX operations to Texas during the pandemic, Neuralink and xAI are bulking up in Silicon Valley. Musk\u2019s xAI firm is hunting for as much as 250,000 square feet of new office space in or near Palo Alto.\nNeuralink, valued above $3 billion, is pushing ahead with human trials of its brain-computer interface designed to help people with paralysis. It has 12 test patients globally and a 10,000-person waitlist for its robotic surgical arm.\n\nSchool\u2019s back in session\nThe Bay Area continues to attract attention from the University of California system as well as out-of-state entities.\nUC Investments\nbought the 331-key Residence Inn Berkeley\nhotel from Pyramid Global Hospitality in an all-cash deal for $175.8 million. It\u2019s a tumble from its 2023 appraised value of $218 million, though it would align with the lodging woes that have led to loan defaults, foreclosures, seizures, bankruptcies and complete closures at hotels across the region in recent years.\nUC\u2019s plans for the property haven\u2019t been disclosed, but it could likely turn into\nstudent housing amid a crunch for academic residences.\nThe move follows UC\u2019s purchase of nearly 100 acres in Belmont in July from Notre Dame de Namur University.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt University\u2019s\nplans for a satellite campus in San Francisco\nare coming into focus. The forthcoming 5M Project, a mixed-use development in South of Market, has reportedly\nemerged as a preferred site\nfor the Nashville school to plant its flag in the Bay Area.\nNewly affordable\nBishop Ranch is on its way to getting its first 100 percent affordable housing project.\nThe City of San Ramon\ngave the green light\nfor 200 new units at 2453 Camino Ramon from nonprofit developer Eden Housing. The residences will rise on a 2.2-acre site as part of the push to turn Sunset Development\u2019s office park into a mixed-use community.\nThe effort will replace Sunset Development\u2019s former 10,000-square-foot service center with a 120-unit building for working families and an 80-unit complex for residents 55 and older. Households earning 30 to 80 percent of area median income will be eligible.\nIt\u2019s a notable step as Bishop Ranch continues to grow its planned housing projects to ditch the area\u2019s staid office reputation. Other projects in the works include the conversion of 761,000 square feet of offices to make way for 485 units across two developments, one of which will include affordable housing for very-low-income households; the replacement of a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units; Related California\u2019s planned 380-unit luxury apartment building;\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex; and Sunset\u2019s transformation of\nthe old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined to take up the Biscayne 21 condo buyout case.\nA brief recap to bring you up to speed: In 2022, Taylor Collins and Reid Boren\u2019s Two Roads Development acquired the majority of condos at Biscayne 21, an older Miami condo building in Edgewater. The developer-controlled condo association then voted to amend the condo declaration\u2019s termination statute, lowering the threshold to 80 percent from 100 percent. (A termination of the association is a required legal step so the developer could eventually knock the building down.)\nTwo Roads, which financed the bulk purchase with a $45 million mezz loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK, launched sales later that year of an Edition Residences planned for the site.\nThen, the holdout owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled association. All the residents eventually had to move out, and the building is no longer habitable.\nThe lawsuit has moved its way through the courts, and the Third District Court of Appeal issued an opinion earlier this year siding with the holdout unit owners. The court affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nLong story short, this was very bad news for the developer, and good news for the holdout owners.\nBut the developer vowed to take the issue to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court. Only, the state\u2019s highest court\ndeclined to hear the issue\n.\nNow, the developer has no other way to appeal, and no leverage with the holdout owners. Two Roads declined to comment on its next steps.\nThe attorneys and other experts I\u2019ve spoken to say that two paths exist: the developer settles with the holdout owners, possibly with a new equity partner who can help recapitalize the project, or the developer-controlled association is forced to repair the building and make it habitable again, operating it as a condo building that is primarily rentals. The latter seems less likely.\nDavid Podein, an attorney at Haber Law who is not involved in the case, said the market may guide the solution.\n\u201cAt the end of the day it is an extremely prime piece of waterfront property,\u201d Podein said.\nMost expect the developer to settle with the holdout owners, but how does Two Roads do that with the debt it owes?\n\nGlen Waldman, the holdout owners\u2019 lawyer, said the lenders will be a key part of how this moves forward. Waldman said the case returns to state court, and he will amend his pleadings to go after the developer for more than $100 million in damages.\nTwo Roads, he said, is \u201cin a terrible position and they deserve it. They\u2019ve destroyed [my clients] homes with no right. Now we go after them like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow will Nahla Capital move the Raleigh Miami Beach project forward now that it\u2019s\ntaken the project over\nfrom Michael Shvo? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Developer Mark Pulte sold the oceanfront spec mansion at 701 South Ocean Boulevard in Delray Beach to a trust for $59 million. The mansion, completed two years ago, spans 14,000 square feet.\nCommercial\n: Miami-based\nCofe Properties\u2019 acquired two warehouses\n, the Milam Dairy Commerce Center I and II at 6700 Northwest 72nd Avenue and 7205 Northwest 68th Street in Medley for $26.8 million. Miami-based Prudence Investments, which had bought the properties in the 1980s and 1990s for a combined $1.9 million, sold the warehouses.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nDeveloper Armando Codina and his wife, Margarita, listed their waterfront estate at 50 Casuarina Concourse in Coral Gables\nfor $45 million\n. Their six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom home spans about 13,400 square feet on a 1.1-acre lot. It\u2019s listed with BHHS EWM Realty\u2019s Scott Shuffield. The mansion, built in 1997, features a 2,000-bottle wine cellar, hand-painted dining room, and a large owner\u2019s suite. The couple paid $1.2 million for the property in 1995. The Codinas plan to move to a luxury apartment building Codina Partners is building in Coral Gables.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMiami-Dade commissioners approved new legislation to make community composting easier and cheaper, according to the\nMiami Herald\n. The legislation could help ease the county\u2019s landfill crisis and curb methane emissions by diverting tens of thousands of tons of organic waste from landfills.\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Florida House unveiled eight bills aimed at cutting property taxes, primarily benefiting homeowners with homestead exemptions, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n. The measures, which would appear on the 2026 ballot, are in response to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 call for property tax relief.\nDonna Adelson, the matriarch of a South Florida family, was sentenced to life in prison without parole after a jury found her guilty of having her son-in-law, law professor Daniel Markel, assassinated,\nInside Edition\nreports. She plans to appeal.\nA Florida judge temporarily halted the transfer of Miami Dade College\u2019s site next to the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami that\u2019s intended for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library, citing alleged open government violations,\nCBS Miami\nreports.",

It\u2019s now worth about $135 million, down about 10 percent from its last valuation, according to Morningstar Credit. That\u2019s a significant drop from the $446 million it was once worth.\nIt\u2019s becoming more apparent that Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld\u2019s Carolwood dodged a bullet when its $130 million deal collapsed.\nThe 900,000 square foot, 41-story, Class A office building at 725 S.

Colliers made it clear that it anticipated the note to trade at discount.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to think that news further impacted the marketability of the note. Neither Colliers nor the court-appointed receiver responded to a request for comment.\nMum\u2019s the word\nIf it weren\u2019t for two analysts and their prodding, Rexford Industrial probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned activist investor Elliott at all during its third quarter\nearnings\ncall. But they asked the question we\u2019ve all wanted an answer to since it was revealed Elliott reportedly built an active stake in the industrial real estate investment trust and had become one of the largest shareholders.\nUnfortunately Rexford was very hush-hush and only said it has met with Elliott and has a constructive dialogue with Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund (that tends to command attention), as it encourages with all its shareholders, but wouldn\u2019t discuss the nature of said discussions.\nNonetheless, the company reported a net income of $87.1 million for the third quarter, compared to $65.1 million a year earlier, an increase of about 34 percent. Revenues increased too, to $253.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30 \u2014 and the company executed 3.3 million square feet of leases in the quarter and sold three properties (two in Los Angeles County) for $53.6 million. It was an earnings beat, but it did mark a change, in that Rexford is no longer on a buying spree.\n\nKilroy Realty and Hudson Pacific Properties are next to report earnings, so stay tuned.\nReceiver central\nAnother downtown Los Angeles commercial property owner could cede control to a receiver.\nLender Cathay Bank\nsued\na company connected to Laeroc Partners, borrower and owner of 530 W. 6th Street, alleging it defaulted on a $31 million loan that matured in September. Cathay Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the 13-story, 160,000-square-foot data-center and office property and for it to be foreclosed upon. It appears the property called the Telecom Center was already on the market, according to a NAI Capital brochure, which does not include an asking price.\nTour, tour, tour\nSenior editor Lauren Schram toured Related California\u2019s new 700 Broadway mixed-use development in Santa Monica that just began leasing, so we\u2019re going to give you a little taste of what we saw.\nOn par with the Southern California lifestyle, the apartment complex has not one but two gyms (and one is an Equinox); a 75-foot rooftop lap pool with a hot tub, cold plunge and two sauna barrels because health and wellness really is everything nowadays and if celebs have a cold plunge so should you; a pet spa outfitted with Andy Warhol-designed black and white French Bulldog wallpaper because who doesn\u2019t love a Frenchie; and a Vons, instead of an Erewhon, Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s.\nThat can all be yours for $3,995 a month, if it\u2019s a studio you want.\nLauren Schram contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "A dispute over a Lincoln Park property has triggered accusations of wrongdoing between the co-CEO of Chicago\u2019s\nlargest residential brokerage\nand a pair of commercial real estate developers.\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nco-CEO Thad Wong\nand\nNorth Park Ventures\nco-founders Robert Sekula and Eric Turrin each filed competing lawsuits accusing the other of breaching contracts over the property at 1628 North Wells Street. Both parties are asking that their joint LLC be dissolved and the building be sold, with the proceeds after paying off the debt being split equally between them, and asking the judge to order the other party to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees.\nBut they\u2019re at odds over the structure, price and broker to use for the deal.\nThe dispute came to a head after a plan to develop a seven-story, 48-unit building with retail fell apart and the owners attempted to sell the property.\nWong has accused Sekula and Turrin of entering into a listing agreement for the property, and rejecting an offer, without his approval. He also accuses them of listing the property for higher than market value to coax other investors to sell their shares to Sekula and Turrin.\nSekula and Turrin, in turn, have accused Wong of demanding that @properties be used to list the building, trying to use an associate to purchase the building and backing out after making an offer to buy them out of the property.\nSekula said he and Turrin are pushing back against many of Wong\u2019s claims; \u201cspecifically, we dispute that we breached the operating agreement for 1628 North Wells LLC or violated any duties owed to Mr. Wong,\u201d he wrote in an email to\nThe Real Deal.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s attorney, Tim Herman, said they \u201cstand by the allegations made in our complaint.\u201d Wong\u2019s attorney, Aaron Stanton, denied the allegations made by Sekula and Turrin when speaking with\nTRD\n.\nWong, Sekula and Turrin formed an LLC in 2018 to purchase the property that currently includes retail and four residential units for $2.4 million. Wong owned 50 percent through his trust, and Sekula and Turin, along with other investors, owned 50 percent through 1628 North Wells NPV LLC.\nThe partnership\u2019s plan failed after the ward alderman, Brian Hopkins, denied their rezoning request. The income from the existing units is not covering the costs for operation and debt service on the $1.58 million mortgage on the building, and the property generated a net loss of $57,000 in 2024, according to the complaints.\nAs they considered selling the building last year, Turrin and Sekula retained two brokers to assess the property\u2019s value. The brokers gave valuations of $1.6 million and $1.8 million, according to both complaints.\nLast month, Turrin and Sekula worked with a broker at Interra Realty to gauge interest in the property, marketing it internally for $2.1 million. Sekula and Turrin said in their filing they did not enter into a fully executed listing agreement. But Wong\u2019s complaint claims they signed a listing agreement without his approval in breach of their contract.\nWong\u2019s attorney denied that Wong insisted on using his firm to market the property. He said he only requested that @properties be used as the broker. In an email he shared with\nTRD,\nStanton asked the partners\u2019 attorney, \u201cWould they agree to have @properties\u2019 commercial list?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked if they would be amenable to that,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly demanding or insisting that they be the broker.\u201d\nWong alleges that Sekula and Turrin set the $2.1 million price, higher than the appraised value, because they didn\u2019t expect to receive offers and wanted to use that as leverage to convince another investor in their LLC to sell the investor\u2019s shares to them, based on a conversation Wong had with Sekula. Wong said they had no intention of selling the property at that price.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint, though, says they believe they can get more than that asking price, because they received such an offer before the building was publicly listed.\nWong\u2019s complaint said that he feared \u201cserious reputational damage\u201d from the alleged conduct over the listing price, arguing the LLC could face a lawsuit from a brokerage for breaching a listing agreement. It also says that he was not aware Sekula and Turrin had other investors in their stake of the property when he partnered with them.\nDuring the marketing process, Sekula and Turrin received an offer to buy the property for $2.1 million from Teo Scorte, a property manager for one of Wong\u2019s properties, according to Sekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint. They rejected the offer and suggested in the complaint that Scorte was acting as an intermediary for Wong, saying the offer was made \u201cunder the guise of being an independent purchaser.\u201d Stanton said Wong informed Scorte of the property being for sale but denied he was acting as an affiliate of Wong.\nIn September, Wong made an offer through his attorney to buy his partners out of the property and become its sole owner. In an email between their attorneys included in the complaint, Stanton wrote that Wong requested \u201cyour client sell the property for $2.1M or sell its 50 percent membership interest to Mr. Wong at half this price ($1.05M).\u201d\nAnother of Sekula and Turrin\u2019s attorneys, Chad Poznansky, replied saying they would accept the offer \u201cto sell NPV\u2019s 50 percent interest in 1628 North Wells LLC to the Wong Trust in exchange for $1,050,000.\u201d\nBut Stanton said that was a misunderstanding of Wong\u2019s offer. The property was weighed down with a $1.58 million mortgage, so each member\u2019s equity at a $2.1 million valuation would be $260,000. He said in a reply to Poznansky\u2019s email that the offer was meant to reflect that, and the amount Wong would pay for their interest would be about $300,000, not $1.05 million, while Wong would assume sole responsibility for the mortgage debt.\n\u201cThe allegation that Mr. Wong agreed to purchase his partner\u2019s interest for $1.05M is false,\u201d according to Stanton.\nSekula and Turrin said in their complaint that Wong breached the contract by backing out of the offer to pay $1.05 million for their 50 percent stake in the property, and they\u2019re asking the judge to order him to buy them out at that price.\nAlternatively, Wong\u2019s complaint says Sekula and Turrin asked for $640,000 for their stake in the property, which was the amount both parties have invested in the property so far. That would equate to a $2.86 million valuation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, and the property is losing money because the rents versus the costs don\u2019t match,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cSo we just want to move on.\u201d\n",

For comparison, Houston\u2019s overall housing price decreased by 1.5 percent.\n\u201cPeople buying condos are first-time buyers on a more limited budget, and those people are most affected right now by inflation and high mortgage rates,\u201d said Itziar Aguirre, senior director of marketing analytics for CoStar.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s also a lot of new supply. Coming out of the pandemic, we saw a surge of demand here for housing, and developers went bananas.\u201d\nHeightened insurance premiums and HOA fees also contribute to the trend, Aguirre said.\nHouston is still the\nbest-supplied housing market in the country,\nbut growth is slowing. Inventory stopped increasing for the first time in nine months in September.\nCondo inventory grew by a narrower margin than other housing types in the last year, with just 15 more units for sale last month compared to September 2024, amounting to a 4 percent increase. Detached housing inventory grew by almost a thousand homes, a 9 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nHouston and Austin tied last month for the greatest decrease in median home price in the country, with each city registering a 1.5 percent drop.\nOther Texas metros failed to counterbalance that. Prices increased by 1 percent in Dallas/Fort Worth and were flat in\nSan Antonio\n.\nIn addition to Houston and Austin, only four other cities depreciated: Atlanta, Tampa, Seattle and Las Vegas.\nOn the other end of the chart, the Rust Belt had the greatest increase in home sale prices, with Pittsburgh, Detroit and Saint Louis taking the top three spots with appreciation of 7 percent or more.\nHouston developers have been taking an interest in condos in recent years.\nTranswestern, Satya and Marriott International\nare all undertaking branded condo projects in the area\n, following Howard Hughes Holdings, which introduced a Ritz-Carlton development to The Woodlands.\n",

        "content": "Vanbarton Group landed a $280 million loan to refinance a Sixth Avenue tower where the developer recently\nconverted several former WeWork office floors\ninto apartments.\nRichard Coles and Gary Tischler\u2019s company secured the loan on the 455-unit building at 980 Sixth Avenue from Invesco, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nVanbarton bought the 25-story building\nfor $316 million in 2018\n. At the time, the tower had 320 apartments sitting on top of three floors of office space, which was then leased to WeWork.\nBut when the co-working company went bankrupt in 2023, the 980 Sixth Avenue location was among some 70 work centers it shuttered. Shortly after, Vanbarton decided to convert WeWork\u2019s three floors into more than 100 apartments.\nWith the conversion now complete, Vanbarton sought out new permanent financing with a five-year term. The new loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust.\nRepresentatives for Vanbarton Group and Invesco could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nVanbarton is one of the most\nactive office-to-residential converters\nin the city, with a current pipeline exceeding 2,000 units.\nThe developer last month secured a\n$300 million loan\nfrom Brookfield to finance its acquisition and conversion of the former Emigrants Savings Bank building at 6 East 43rd Street. Vanbarton purchased the 400,000-square-foot building for $135 million earlier this year and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments.\nColes and Tischler also recently purchased the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which they plan to convert into 420 apartments. Last year, they bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which will be transformed into 647 units.\nEarlier this month Vanbarton refinanced Pearl House, the 1970s-era FiDi office building it converted into 477 apartments, with $280 million in debt from AllianceBernstein and Brookfield.\n",

All Star Recruiting, which state records show is affiliated with All Star Healthcare Solutions, will move from its Deerfield Beach office at 800 Fairway Drive.\nAlso, tech firm EchoTwin AI, which provides AI spatial intelligence for cities to manage services and infrastructure, leased 2,700 square feet, marking its first office. Its founder Chris Carson is moving to South Florida from San Francisco.\nThe tenants that opted to stay at BRiC are health care tech firm Modernizing Medicine, which renewed its 127,800-square-foot lease; private school Everglades University renewed its 52,600-square-foot lease and publicly traded financial services firm NewtekOne renewed its 7,800-square-foot lease, according to the release.\nRyan Nunes and Alan Kleber of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented All Star Recruiting, Cinch Home Services and Modernizing Medicine. JJL\u2019s Zach Wendelin and Adam Bernstein represented Everglades University. Bernstein has since joined Stream Realty. Jeff Kelly of CBRE represented the landlord, Boca Raton-based CP Group.\nCP Group, led by Angelo Bianco and Chris Eachus, and New York-based DRA Advisors, led by David Luski, own the 1.7 million-square-foot BRiC. In 2021, DRA paid\n$320.2 million\nfor a stake in the campus at 5000 T-Rex Avenue in\nBoca Raton\n.\nOriginally developed in the 1960s by IBM for its research and development, BRiC is undergoing a $100 million renovation that includes the addition of spec suites part of CP Group\u2019s worCPlaces flexible office portfolio, a Boca Raton Regional Hospital-managed wellness center, an autonomous grand-and-go store, two coffee shops, two gyms and indoor/outdoor event space, the release says.\nCP Group and DRA Advisors are expected to redevelop\nBRiC\ninto a mixed-use complex with multifamily, retail, dining, entertainment and a grocery store.

The space is larger than Ripco\u2019s previous 3,900-square-foot office at 1221 Brickell Avenue.\nThe new office will accommodate future employee growth and is more central to Ripco\u2019s markets, Pavli said.\nNew York-based Ripco first opened a Miami office in 2021, seizing on the influx of New Yorkers and other out-of-staters to South Florida. The in-migration fueled a market boom fueled by an office leasing frenzy and rent growth.\nRipco\u2019s business lines include landlord and tenant representation for retail leasing, investment sales across asset classes, and debt and equity advisory service. Last year, Ripco acquired Miami-based retail brokerage\nAcre\n, which has four brokers.\nSan Diego-based Cire Equity, led by Joshua Volen and Trevor Smith, owns the 12-story Gateway at Wynwood and adjacent one-story bank building at 2830 North Miami Avenue. In August, Cire acquired the\n$89.6 million\ncredit bid for the property from A10 Capital, as special servicer for the property\u2019s loan.\nGateway\u2019s developer, R&amp;B Realty, completed the project in 2021 and then faced foreclosure over an allegedly $112.9 million delinquent mortgage.

        "content": "Being close to Grand Central Terminal is a perk often proclaimed by pitching office landlords, but it\u2019s not a panacea for the ills facing Manhattan\u2019s market.\nClarion Partners and Alchemy Properties are in danger of foreclosure at 209-211 East 43rd Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 24-story, 211,000-square-foot property is only a block from the major transit hub.\nLast week, a Miami-based plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court against a limited liability company with apparent links to a venture between the two owners, alleging default on a $57 million loan.\nIndividuals and the owners aren\u2019t specifically named by the lawsuit, but principals for both companies signed documents for a $65 million loan issued by Signature Bank in 2015. The loan was amended to $57 million in 2022, then ultimately passed along to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff notified ownership of its default in April, claiming they owed $56.3 million, plus interest, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOwnership says it is is charting a path forward; a spokesperson told the outlet that it remains \u201ccommitted to achieving a positive and timely outcome for all parties involved through the successful recapitalization of the property.\u201d\nAlchemy and ABR Partners, in partnership with Clarion, acquired the leasehold on the Midtown East building in 2015 for\n$99 million\n, two years after Meadow Partners bought it for $61 million. Meadow spent $7 million on improvements and turned over much of the tenant roster during its brief ownership.\nTenants at the building include the missions of Bosnia, Mauritius and Costa Rica, Midtown Dental Services and physiatrist Douglas Schwartz. Japanese restaurant Izakaya Futago occupies the ground floor.\nAsking rent for office space in the building ranges from $35 to $144 per square foot, according to CoStar. There\u2019s roughly 30,000 square feet of space available across seven of the property\u2019s upper floors, according to Avison Young.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The City of Fort Lauderdale approved a major Live Local Act redevelopment of The Quay at 17th Street, a waterfront retail and office plaza.\nThe project is a joint venture with Coconut Grove-based The Related Group, led by Jorge, Jon Paul and Nicholas P\u00e9rez; Aventura-based\nBH Group\n, led by Liat and Isaac Toledano; and Boca Raton-based\nPebb Enterprises\n, led by Ian Weiner. The three firms that have partnered on other recent South Florida projects.\nThe development group won administrative approval for the project under the state law that allows qualifying affordable housing initiatives to bypass standard public hearings.\nThe partnership wants to redevelop the mixed-use complex and six-yacht marina on seven acres at 1515 17th Street into\nThe Quay\n, a 33-story project with 521 apartments along with 5,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 750 parking spaces. The developers plan to set aside 217 units for affordable and workforce housing, plans show.\n\nThe unit mix will range from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The developers also intend to demolish two low-rise office buildings to create a waterfront public plaza, while retaining the existing shopping center on the site.\nThe lot is currently zoned for 361 residential units and up to 12,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, but under the Live Local Act, the city can approve the greater density without city commission approval since 40 percent of the homes will be affordable.\nLast year, the Related-BH-Pebb partnership paid\n$48.5 million\nfor The Quay property. The same group also owns\nOcean Walk\n, a retail plaza on Singer Island in Riviera Beach, and the former\nOffice Depot\nheadquarters campus in Boca Raton, where it plans a mixed-use project with 500 apartments, a large gym and several outparcels for retail and restaurants.\nThe Quay adds to Related\u2019s growing portfolio of Live Local developments across South Florida. Recently, the firm\u2019s affordable and workforce housing division submitted plans for a multifamily and hotel project at\nJackson Memorial Hospital\u2019s campus\nin Miami. Related is seeking to develop a 27-story tower with 460 apartments, a 31-story tower with 382 units and an 18-story, 128-key hotel. The development would also include 4,200 square feet of retail and 714 parking spaces in a pair of seven-story garages.",

        "content": "Just 35 paying tenants are left in the 130-unit South Shore building raided by federal agents in the middle of the night last month, a massive operation that stirred national controversy over immigration enforcement.\nAfter the raid disturbed the residents and left lingering uneasiness over the South Side neighborhood, a Cook County circuit court judge is now considering ordering them to move out due to its hazardous living conditions.\nPrior to the raid, the building had both paying tenants and squatters, though it\u2019s unclear how many. Federal agents, including from the ATF, the FBI and ICE, arrested 37 people on Sept. 30 for a variety of offenses, though information on the severity of the alleged crimes has been limited so far.\nLocal officials criticized the tactics that federal agents used in the raid, including allegedly temporarily detaining residents who were not later arrested.\nThe building, along with several others in a portfolio held by Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood, is the subject of a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit brought by Wells Fargo on behalf of CMBS bond holders.\nMore details about the aftermath of the raid were revealed in a Friday hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s request to appoint a receiver to the building. Property manager Corey Oliver of Strength in Management said at the hearing that some tenants have moved out since the raid and about 35 have stayed put. He estimated that there are about 10 nonpaying squatters still occupying the property, as well.\nConditions at the 7500 South South Shore Drive building had been deteriorating for some time.\nThe foreclosure was filed earlier this year after Flood, the landlord, failed to make debt payments on the South Shore building as well as several others in Chicago and across the U.S.\n\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton heard from city inspectors, the ward\u2019s alderman and Oliver, who all relayed varying descriptions of the current state of the building. City inspectors tasked with evaluating electrical systems at the building were particularly alarmed by faulty wiring leading out to the city\u2019s utility poles, noting that lines hang low enough to hit the top of a garbage truck.\nThey also pointed to fire hazards caused by extension cords and hijacked meters in the building, likely used to provide power to squatters\u2019 units. Only one of the building\u2019s elevators is operating. A plumbing inspector noted that the boiler room had a strong odor that could be attributed to a gas leak and stated that raw sewage and sewer gases were leaking into the building at various points.\nBut Oliver said that since the raid Flood had already invested $100,000 into repairs to the building, including plumbing and electrical repairs. He also said he was told he needed to re-submit a permit for some of the electrical work that needed to be done at the property. Another new addition is three armed security guards that now patrol the building from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night.\nFlood\u2019s attorney attended the hearing on her behalf which was a choice Seaton criticised.\nSeaton said she will not appoint a receiver until she can evaluate the progress of the work currently ongoing at the property. If the immediate dangers are not resolved quickly, though, she said she will not only consider appointing a receiver but will also weigh issuing a court order for all the remaining tenants to relocate.\nThe order would also likely require some form of relocation assistance be provided to the tenants.\nDuring the hearing, 7th Ward Alderman Greg Mitchell, who represents the area, said he is skeptical that things will turn around in the next few weeks. \u201cMy current concern is that I don\u2019t feel the building is safe,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe building has been broken into several times and it is a target now.\u201d\nJonah Karsh with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization said that prior to the raid, tenants he heard from did not want to stay in the building. \u201cWe had dozens of tenants requesting relocation,\u201d he said.\nSeaton said she wanted to hear from the current tenants herself before deciding if an order was necessary. She asked that current tenants attend a hearing regarding the receivership next month. She ordered another inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing for Nov. 7.",

The properties spent 132 days on the market, on average.\nForty-four luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,177 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 16 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $124.3 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the ten single-family homes and six condos under contract last week totals $159.1 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $10.2 million and spent an average of 127 days on the market. They total $101.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nThe priciest single-family home to secure a buyer is the waterfront home at 6380 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. Richard Lane, chairman emeritus of the New York-based\nOlnick Organization\n, and his wife, Barbara Lane, own the 4,500-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom house at 6380 North Bay Road. It\u2019s on the market with Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker. The Lanes\npaid $9 million\nfor the property in 2020. The house was built in 1951 on a 0.6-acre lot.\nThe second most-expensive house to go under contract last week is the waterfront 9,200-square-foot mansion at 16 Palm Avenue. A trust in the name of Tom Sullivan, founder and CEO of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee-based Lumber Liquidators, owns the 0.8-acre property on Palm Island in Miami Beach. It\u2019s on the market with Venetian International\u2019s Luis Bosch, asking $24.9 million. The six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home was built in 1930. It previously sold for $11.5 million in 2008.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $9.6 million and spent 141 days on the market, on average. They total $57.5 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,3723 per square foot.\nA double-condo at the Continuum South Beach owned by the late Broadway producer Luigi Caiola and his husband, Sean McGill, found a buyer. Bill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bill and Bryan Team are listing unit 2608/2609 at 100 South Pointe Drive in Miami Beach for $19.4 million. The 3,700-square-foot unit, with four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, also comes with a guest suite and two assigned parking spaces.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 30 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $246 million, and the typical home spent 688 days on the market.\n",

The floating-rate, interest-only loan refinances existing debt on the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at 60 Columbus Circle and covers roughly two-thirds of its $1.65 billion appraised value, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nIt will carry a two-year term with three one-year extension options and will be co-originated by German American Capital Corp. and Wells Fargo, which will serve as mortgage loan sellers.\nDeutsche Bank, which relocated its U.S. headquarters to the tower from Wall Street in 2021, occupies 93.5 percent of the building under a 20-year lease with an option to renew for another two decades. The property is fully leased, according to Fitch, reflecting resilience in a midtown market still navigating post-pandemic shifts in office demand.\nThe building \u2014\nformerly\nthe Time Warner Center before the media giant decamped to Hudson Yards \u2014 sits within the 2.8 million-square-foot Deutsche Bank Center complex overlooking Columbus Circle. Related retains a roughly 3 percent stake in the office tower, while Singapore\u2019s GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority each hold 48.1 percent.\n\nRepresentatives for the owners didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe refinancing marks a turnaround from a larger $1.5 billion single-asset CMBS deal the same ownership group shelved in 2022 amid bond-market volatility. With financing conditions still tight and benchmark rates high, the successful closing of this smaller, shorter-term loan would signal improving lender confidence in trophy New York assets with stable tenancy.\nThe loan is slated to close Oct. 29.\nDeutsche Bank Center remains one of Manhattan\u2019s premier mixed-use properties, with its office component joined by luxury retail and the Mandarin Oriental hotel.\n",

The sprawling limestone mansion topped off a total of 30 homes in the borough asking $4 million or more to enter contract, up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n.\nCosby listed the 13,000-square-foot abode in September in an\nattempt to offload it\nbefore his lender, First Foundation Bank, foreclosed on the property. The bank initiated proceedings roughly nine months ago, claiming Cosby had defaulted on a $17.5 million loan and owed more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nThe disgraced former sitcom star and his wife, Camille, bought the six-story townhouse in 1987 for $6.3 million. The home, known as the Luyster Mansion and built in 1899, has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It also features an elevator and 500-square-foot rooftop terrace.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to nab a signed contract was a penthouse at 895 Park Avenue, with an asking price of $21.5 million. The triplex apartment on the 16th, 17th and 18th floors hit the market in March asking just under $30 million.\n\nThe co-op spans 6,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a library, staff rooms, three fireplaces and multiple terraces. It last traded for $15 million in 2009 and underwent a two-year renovation the following year.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nThe Park Avenue co-op is also home to a\nfamed penthouse\nthat once belonged to composer Leonard Bernstein, who in 1970, along with his wife Felicia, hosted an event for the Black Panther Party which Tom Wolfe wrote about for New York Magazine.\nOf the 30 properties, 19 were condos, seven were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $246 million, for an average price of $8.2 million and a median of $6.1 million. The typical home spent nearly two years on the market and was discounted 10 percent from the original listing price.\n",

The concept calls for an \u201copen-air destination\u201d that could accommodate events too large for the\nSalt Shed\u2019s\n5,500-person outdoor limit.\nGolden, who co-founded Sterling Bay before launching\nBlue Star\nin 2008, estimates the expansion would cost between $60 million and $70 million including land acquisition, infrastructure and construction.\nThe property is being sold by a Labkon family venture that once operated the General Iron scrap metal plant nearby. Colliers\u2019 Mike Senner is marketing the site.\n\nSignificant challenges remain. The riverfront parcel needs major upgrades \u2014 new seawalls, water and sewer lines \u2014 that could add to the bill. Golden hasn\u2019t ruled out seeking public subsidies such as tax-increment financing but said the project\u2019s feasibility is still being evaluated.\nIf built, the venue could host 30 to 40 shows each summer and offer space for neighborhood street fests or a winter skating rink. The expansion would also cement the North Branch Industrial Corridor\u2019s shift from factories to festivals, part of a broader post-industrial makeover that began after the city eased zoning restrictions along the river in 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural addition to what we do,\u201d Golden said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The offices at those sites are expected to be redeveloped into housing, in the largest office redevelopment in the Peninsula proposed this year.\nMeanwhile, apartment construction has fallen off dramatically, with apartment starts in the Bay Area dropping from more than 3,000 in a typical quarter to only a few hundred.\nAcross the country, 542,800 units were under construction at the end of the second quarter, marking the\nlowest level in a decade\n, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nHigh borrowing costs and pricey labor and materials are forcing developers to slam the brakes for projects already entitled or proposed.\nThere are a few Peninsula cities, however, that could provide multifamily developers some hope. In Daly City, developers started construction on the enclave\u2019s first market-rate apartment project in 15 years, which will\nreplace a former Burlington Coat Factory\nat Westlake Shopping Center with a 214-unit residential complex.\nSouth San Francisco, meanwhile, is seeing an increase in construction activity as compact, mixed-use areas become more attractive to developers and residents.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Andrew Rasken\u2019s Meta Development is launching sales for Colette, a boutique condominium planned in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nWith the launch, Rasken is betting that size matters in a market saturated with large-scale luxury projects, many of them boasting hundreds of units and brands like\nSt. Regis\nand\nDolce &amp; Gabbana\n. Rasken\u2019s Colette is a five-story, 38-unit luxury condo slated for 1880 Brickell Avenue, with prices starting at $3.3 million, according to a press release. He\u2019s tapped Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team to lead sales and marketing for the project.\n\u201cBoutique is what everyone wants now,\u201d said Fredrik Eklund, who heads the team along with John Gomes. \u201cThese huge glass towers can take many, many, many years to build and sometimes to sell out. There\u2019s a little more risk as a buyer.\u201d\n\nFloor plans in Colette will span between two- and four-bedrooms. The building will also have two penthouses. Colette\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, wellness facilities, a screening room, children\u2019s playroom, and a meeting room. The design team includes Brazilian architecture group OSPA.\n\u201cWe believe that the next chapter in South Florida is not just height and glass,\u201d Rasken said.\nHe anticipates the buyer demographic for this project will include locals, particularly younger buyers who have been renting in Brickell and are considering a move to Coconut Grove. Rasken and Eklund also expect buyers from the Northeast. They foresee Colette\u2019s buyers making the building their primary home.\nRasken went into contract for the 0.8 acre Colette site for\n$10.7 million\nlast year. His other projects include Opus, a 14-unit boutique condominium project in Coconut Grove. He landed a\n$28 million construction loan\nfor the building from Arixa Capital in August.",

The listing breaks down to $1,643 per square foot of interior space.\nThe eight-bedroom apartment spans the entire 51st and 52nd floors of Museum Tower. The interiors account for 14,000 square feet, while there are another 2,000 square feet worth of private terraces. Features of the apartment include a wood-burning fireplace, multiple kitchens, a double-height foyer with a spiral staircase and a private gym in the primary suite. Views are of Central Park and both the Hudson and the East Rivers.\nIcahn first listed the apartment in 2019 for $35 million, before the pandemic wrought havoc on the market. After slashing the ask by $5 million, he took the property off the market in 2021.\nIt was a similarly long quest to put the unit together in the first place. Icahn purchased the first component of the property for less than $3.5 million in 1986. He tacked on another $3.2 million purchase in 1994, then completed the collection with\na $9 million buy\nin 2018, a year before he listed the property.\n\nIcahn has since moved to\nIndian Creek Village\nin Miami.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Patricia Vance has the listing and said the unit is \u201cpriced to sell.\u201d Ichan has stuck to the advice of his real estate agents on how to price the property, he said.\nMuseum Tower was built in 1983 and designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli. The property sits on top of the Museum of Modern Art and has 250 residences. Many sellers have slashed prices or sold at losses in recent years, stuck between a challenging market and a plethora of other luxury options that have sprung up for the wealthy, particularly\non Billionaires\u2019 Row\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Patty McHugh and David Duncan came up with some cash to hold onto a big Hilton-branded hotel complex connected to Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place convention center.\nMcHugh Enterprises, the development arm of Chicago mega-contractor\nMcHugh Construction\n, and Duncan\u2019s firm\nFirst Investors\nrefinanced their Hilton-branded South Loop lodging asset with a $92 million floating-rate, interest-only loan from Access Point Financial.\nThe deal comes out to roughly $20 million shy of the mortgage the landlords secured six years ago, before the pandemic reset the deck for hospitality in Chicago and across the globe.\nIt\u2019s unclear what kind of financial mechanism \u2014 an out-of-pocket paydown or a preferred equity arrangement with an outside party \u2014 allowed McHugh and First Investors to close the debt gap; Walker &amp; Dunlop, which arranged the debt deal, said there wasn\u2019t any subordinate capital involved, pointing toward the borrowers paying down the difference.\nEither way, the smaller first mortgage reflects today\u2019s tighter lending climate and the\nrecalibration of hotel valuations\nsince 2019. Lender\nACORE Financial\u2019s recent $187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst longtime Chicago hotelier Su-Mei Yen for a separate South Loop hotel complex and the\nsame lender\u2019s seizure of a River North hotel\nhave jolted the city\u2019s hospitality industry.\nThe loan was for the Hiltons at McCormick Place at 123 East Cermak Road, the 466-key tri-branded property connected to the city\u2019s convention center, Walker &amp; Dunlop said in a release.\nMcHugh and First Investors developed the 23-story hotel tower in 2018 with a $78 million mortgage from Wells Fargo,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported, when the property was hailed as the country\u2019s first triple-branded Hilton.\n\nThey refinanced in 2019 with the $112 million mortgage from CrossHarbor, meaning they could have pocketed some of the difference with a cash-out deal.\nThe deal with Access Point underscores how refinancing math has shifted for even strong-performing hospitality assets. What once penciled out at nine figures now looks more modest, as rising interest costs and lender caution reshape the post-pandemic playbook for hotel owners.\nPatty McHugh, chair of McHugh Enterprises, stated that the property \u201ccontinues to thrive,\u201d crediting Walker &amp; Dunlop for navigating the process amid volatile capital markets. The company\u2019s construction arm also built the hotel, which combines Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn and Home2 Suites brands under one roof.\nA McHugh spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment regarding how the debt gap was closed from the CrossHarbor deal.\nThe fresh capital gives the ownership group breathing room in a higher-rate market that\u2019s throttled hospitality deals citywide.\nEven as Chicago\u2019s convention business rebounds, hotel trades have been scarce, and refinancing packages increasingly reflect smaller principal balances as values lag behind pre-pandemic highs.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Aaron Appel and Dustin Stolly led the capital markets team for the Hiltons at McCormick deal, while the firm\u2019s Jay Morrow and Carter Gradwell advised the borrowers. The firm touted the asset\u2019s strong performance \u2014 120 percent of submarket revenue per available room \u2014 and its positioning next to the 2.6-million-square-foot McCormick Place Convention Center, which draws about 3 million visitors annually.\n",

The Daniels\u2019 could not be reached for comment, and Roch did not respond to inquiries from Crain\u2019s. Berrien County property records show the couple has owned the site since at least 2015 through a trust in Lee Daniels\u2019 name.\n\nThe price bump reflects a tightening\nhigh-end market\nin the Lake Michigan resort town, where multimillion-dollar listings have been moving fast.\nA home about half a mile away on Marquette Drive went under contract within three days after hitting the market earlier this month for just under $7 million. Another property along the Galien River listed for nearly $5 million in September also found a buyer in less than two weeks.\nThough the Daniels\u2019 $6.99 million ask is near the top of the local market, it\u2019s still below New Buffalo\u2019s record sale \u2014 an $8.52 million transaction in 2023 for the house next door.\nDaniels, 82, was a fixture in Illinois Republican politics for more than three decades. He represented\nDuPage County\ndistricts in the state House from 1975 to 2007, serving as Minority Leader for most of that period and as Speaker from 1995 to 1997. After leaving office, he practiced law and ran a west suburban commercial real estate brokerage.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "When Florida lawmakers first approved the Live Local Act in 2023 in an effort to alleviate the affordable housing crisis, developers rushed to seize on its incentives and filed a slew of project applications.\nSince then, they\u2019ve completed nearly 3,200 below-market rental units in 23 projects across the state, according to a Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how long real estate takes,\u201d said attorney Anthony De Yurre, referring to the drawn out project approval and construction process.\nThe law incentivizes developers by allowing them to build bigger projects \u2013 up to the highest density permitted in a jurisdiction and the tallest height permitted within a mile \u2013 as long as they designate at least 40 percent of their apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income. The apartments have to remain at below-market rents for at least 30 years.\nLive Local\u2019s other perks are that developers can bypass public hearings and only go through administrative approvals and tiered property tax exemptions: a 75 percent exemption for apartments for households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the AMI, and a 100 percent exemption for apartments for earners of less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe law was tweaked in the past two years, including to loosen floor area ratio and parking requirements. Those who jumped on projects right after the legislation was first passed have been working through site plan approval and construction drawing permitting, De Yurre said.\n\u201cI can tell you from my projects, now is when we are heavily engaged in discussions with lenders for early adopters of the law,\u201d De Yurre said.\nBut developers still are betting big on Live Local. A total of 143 projects with 43,400 units, combined, are in various stages from proposed to approved under the state law, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows.\nNearly half of the planned units are in Miami-Dade County, while 11.2 percent are in Broward County and 6.3 percent are in Palm Beach County, the Florida Housing Coalition data shows.\nQuestions still loom over Live Local. For one, lenders are only now getting introduced to Live Local projects and analyzing their financials. And although developers continue to rush to file project proposals, questions remain whether Live Local will help alleviate the affordable housing crisis.\nAcross Florida, there were 25 affordable apartments available and attainable for every 100 extremely low income households, or those earning up to 30 percent of the AMI, last year, according to the Florida TaxWatch report.\nAI woes\n\nAs South Florida developers feel the sting from higher construction costs and insurance premiums, as well as elevated interest rates, confusion and widespread misinformation about the law also is delaying projects.\nUnder Live Local, Florida counties that have a sufficient supply of below-market rentals that exceeds the demand from earners of less than 120 percent of the AMI can opt out of the property tax exemption. None of South Florida\u2019s three counties, where the affordable housing crisis is most heightened, qualify for this, the Florida TaxWatch report shows.\n\u201cChatGPT and AI has a very bizarre way of rearing its head in the legal world and usually creates a lot of misinformation,\u201d said De Yurre, a Miami-based land use and zoning attorney who helped draft the act and represents developers pursuing Live Local projects.\u00a0 \u201cIt is creating a lot of misinformation with lenders in regards to the statute and property tax exemption.\u201d\nGenerally, private equity is \u201calways going to be more entrepreneurial\u201d and open to Live Local compared with banks, which usually prefer to lend on programs once they become widespread, De Yurre said.\nSouth Florida\u2019s most advanced Live Local projects include Cymbal DLT Companies\u2019 completed\n341-unit Laguna Gardens\ncomplex in Miami Gardens. Completed last year, it was originally planned as market-rate rentals and Cymbal DLT retroactively converted it to Live Local, allowing the firm to use the law\u2019s tax breaks.\nAlso, near North Miami, developer Daniel Abreu scored\n$16.5 million\nlast year to build an 80-unit building, marking one of the first known construction loans for a Live Local project.\n\u201cMissing middle\u201d v. extremely low income\nThe need for below-market rentals in South Florida is high.\nIn Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, there\u2019s a deficit of 143,805 units for households earning less than 80 percent of the AMI, according to the Florida TaxWatch report, which cited a 2024 University of Florida study for the data. The deficit is 85,345 units in Broward County, and 37,699 units in Palm Beach County.\nMany Live Local developers are marketing their South Florida projects\u2019 below-market rate apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, but few are dropping rents for the extremely low-income who earn 30 percent of the AMI.\nBut De Yurre argues it\u2019s earners of 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI, the so-called \u201cmissing middle,\u201d whom Live Local is intended to help. Projects with lower rents generally would have to be subsidized by low-income housing tax credits and other public financing programs.\n\u201cPeople say this [Live Local] isn\u2019t truly affordable. But if you do less than 80 percent [of the AMI], the teacher can\u2019t qualify,\u201d he said, arguing that the workforce such as educators, firefighters and police make too much to qualify for a unit targeting earners below 80 percent of the AMI. \u201cThis is the only program that helps out in that regard. This is the only program that helps out in that regard.\u201d",

The home, which is currently listed for $23.8 million, or $2,633 per square foot, fell into contract last week to become the top pending deal for the period, based on its asking price. That\u2019s according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team\u2019s\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by Marcy Roth.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nDrew Fenton\nand Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s\nAaron Kirman\nhold the listing.\nAnthony purchased the property in 2010 for $3.5 million, when it still had the original house built in the 1940s. That was ultimately torn down for a new build in 2018,\u00a0 a project that was completed in 2022, according to a\nWall Street Journal\ninterview with Anthony and his wife, Betim Anthony, at the time of the property\u2019s listing.\nThe new home, which sits on over half an acre, has seven bedrooms and 10 baths across over 9,000 square feet. Dubbed the \u201cBentley House,\u201d the home is shrouded in privacy behind gates and hedges. Inside, there\u2019s a screening room, wine cellar, office and gym.\nLast year is when the couple decided to hang up the for-sale sign, listing the home for nearly $27 million, or $2,986 per square foot.\nSitting in the No. 2 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts within Los Angeles County is 14952 Alva Drive in Pacific Palisades.\nThe property is listed for $13.9 million, or $2,037 per square foot, and is located in the Palisades\u2019 Huntington neighborhood.\n\nThe six-bed, nine-bath home spans 6,800 square feet. The gated property sits on about a third of an acre, with highlights that include a media room, pool house, pool, cold plunge, outdoor shower and spa.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld has the listing.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Jeffrey Mark Hancock and Susan Gregg Renfrew, according to property records.\nOverall, the number of contracts signed in L.A. County last week was flat at 16 compared to a year ago, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, last week\u2019s asking volume fell about 7 percent from a year earlier to $129.1 million.\nRoth called out the activity as another example of Los Angeles\u2019 \u201croller coaster\u201d real estate market, after three straight weeks notching year-over-year increases in volume.\n\u201cWe suspect this is a blip in the market as, anecdotally, we are starting to see properties that have previously sat, go under contract,\u201d she said.\nRoth tempered the point, however, adding that \u201cit is possible the holiday slowdown has begun.\u201d\n",

Builder and pricing details are still under wraps.\nJohnson Development has made refinements to the original plan, expanding the community\u2019s open-space and recreation features, CEO Michael Smith said.\nRoughly 1,200 acres \u2014 nearly 40 percent of the property \u2014 will be preserved as green space, with 26 miles of trails winding through heavily wooded stretches along Hickory Creek. The community will also feature two lakes, a pair of amenity centers, a 50-acre city park and a 55-acre business park.\nOn the civic side, about 206 acres will be reserved for two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school within the Denton ISD. Another 156 acres are earmarked for commercial use.\n\nThe site is just south of Hillwood\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLandmark\nproject.\nDenton Range, managed by Silvestri Investments, is an investor in the project. Johnson Development is already active in North Texas with its\nViridian\ncommunity in Arlington and\nTrinity Falls\nin McKinney.\nPlans for Cole Ranch stretch back to the mid-2010s, when the city first held public hearings on the massive residential proposal.\nThe Texas Legislature approved a municipal management district for the site in 2019. Earlier this year, Denton City Council tweaked the zoning for more than 300 acres from light industrial land in favor of residential and mixed-use development, signaling the city\u2019s shift toward a more community-oriented buildout.\nThe property has deep local roots. The Cole family has owned the land since the 1930s, when Miner Thomas \u201cM.T.\u201d Cole ran it as a working ranch. His great-granddaughter Jennifer Alexander said the family sought a partner that would honor the history and the beauty of the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Cheves succeeds Dale Petroskey, who led the DRC for nearly 12 years before stepping down this summer for family reasons, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nHis appointment caps a months-long search led by Russell Reynolds Associates and a nine-member selection committee of past, current and future board chairs.\nDarcy Anderson\n, vice chair of\nRoss Perot Jr.\u2019s\nHillwood Development, was the only representative of the commercial real estate sector on the selection committee and is slated to serve as the chamber\u2019s board chair next year.\nThe chamber will introduce Cheves at its annual meeting on Jan. 27 at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center.\nCheves, 63, has spent the past two decades as SMU\u2019s senior vice president for development and external affairs, where he oversaw fundraising, marketing and community engagement. He led the school\u2019s $1.65 billion \u201cSMU Ignited: Boldly Shaping Tomorrow\u201d campaign, which reached its goal three years ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cI love\nSMU\n, and there\u2019s never a good time to leave a place you love, but if there is a time, it\u2019s now,\u201d Cheves told the outlet. He said his focus at the chamber will center on education and workforce development, areas he believes are critical to sustaining Dallas\u2019 economic momentum.\nPetroskey called Cheves \u201ca proven and highly respected leader,\u201d adding that he\u2019s stepping into \u201cthe best job in America\u201d at what he described as a \u201csweet moment in time for the Dallas region.\u201d Under Petroskey\u2019s leadership, the number of Fortune 500 firms in DFW grew by a third, while more than 70 Fortune 1000 companies joined the DRC\u2019s ranks.\nCheves\u2019 civic resume runs deep. He sits on the boards of Broadway Dallas, the Circle Ten Council of Scouting America, the Texas Lyceum and the Dallas Council on Foreign Relations. His connections across business, academia and philanthropy are expected to help the DRC continue shaping Dallas\u2019 ascent as a global corporate hub.\nFormer\nDallas Mavericks\nCEO Cynt Marshall, a past DRC chair, called Cheves the \u201cright leader for a new era,\u201d while Cowboys owner\nJerry Jones\npraised his \u201cremarkable record of success.\u201d\nCheves said he\u2019s bullish on Dallas\u2019 resilience and future.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
