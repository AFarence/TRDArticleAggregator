        "content": "Like any good socialist, Zohran Mamdani is familiar with the Marxist phrase, \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d\nMamdani says he was making\n$47,000 a year\nwhen he moved into his rent-stabilized apartment, which he found on StreetEasy. Maybe he needed a low-rent unit then. But now he makes\n$142,000\n, his wife also works, and his parents are wealthy.\nClearly, Mamdani is getting more than he needs. Karl Marx would not approve.\nNow\nalong comes Andrew Cuomo\n, calling on his rival mayoral candidate to give up the $2,300-a-month one-bedroom in Astoria.\nCuomo also pitched \u201c\nmeans testing\n\u201d to screen out high-earning tenants from rent-stabilized housing: To initially lease a unit, a tenant\u2019s monthly income could not be more than 3.33 times the monthly rent. That is, the rent would have to be at least 30 percent of the tenant\u2019s income.\nThat might sound appealing to critics of rent regulation and even to progressives. Why should more than 1 in 5 rent-stabilized units go to households making six figures?\nHowever, allowing only low-income people to lease these apartments is a bad idea, although not for the reasons that most people think.\nRent stabilization is a fundamentally flawed housing system. It is literally designed to\nperpetuate the housing emergency\n.\nTo give it a veneer of legitimacy by means testing is like painting over mold. It might look better initially, but doesn\u2019t fix the problem. Indeed, mold only gets worse under new paint.\n\u201cThe problem with rent control is that it addresses a problem rooted in regulations with more regulations,\u201d wrote\nMichael Hendrix\nof the Manhattan Institute. \u201cRent regulations \u2018solve\u2019 America\u2019s affordability crisis for a few people, for a short time, at great cost to everyone else.\u201d\nThe fact that many well-off New Yorkers enjoy artificially low rents \u2014 some while keeping beach houses or country homes \u2014 is a potent argument to junk the whole system.\nBut there are better reasons to end it altogether. Rent regulation merely creates winners and losers, reducing vacancy at 1 million apartments to nearly zero. It promotes the deterioration of housing, makes tenants enemies rather than customers of landlords, hinders new construction and stands in the way of a fair and functional housing market.\n\nIf that sounds too philosophical, consider the practical arguments against means testing.\nOwners of rent-stabilized housing are under the government\u2019s thumb in so many ways. Means-testing deprives them of the right to rent to a tenant of their choice, and adds yet another layer of bureaucracy. The last thing owners need is another hoop to jump through.\nAlso, it\u2019s usually easier to operate a mixed-income building than one where everyone is barely getting by.\nNew York actually had a crude form of means testing until June 15, 2019: A landlord could evict tenants from rent-stabilized units by proving that they made more than $225,000 two years in a row.\nThat was difficult and it rarely happened. Then the 2019 rent reform removed the incentives to vacate a unit. So even if means testing were restored, most landlords would gain nothing by enforcing an income limit.\nAn asset limit would be even harder to police, as assets are private and easily hidden.\nIn theory, the state could monitor tenants\u2019 income by looking at their tax returns. If the Division of Homes and Community Renewal provided the tax department with a complete list of rent-stabilized units, the tax office could flag tenants who exceeded an income threshold.\nBut then what? Who would evict these tenants? Landlords are not going to endure a two-year slog through housing court and pay thousands in legal fees to replace rich tenants with poor ones who pay exactly the same rent.\nTraditional affordable housing programs only screen incomes before the initial lease-signing. They don\u2019t kick out tenants who get a raise or a better job. That would be highly disruptive, and a disincentive for people to advance their careers.\nIf Mamdani left his apartment, it would not guarantee his landlord would rent it to a needier tenant. And forcing unsubsidized landlords to do that is unworkable and possibly unconstitutional.\nI don\u2019t blame Cuomo for raising this subject, even though he was dishonest to say that Mamdani\u2019s rental forces a mother and her children to live in a shelter. He is trying to win an election, and his attack has brought attention to a dysfunctional system. Besides, all is fair in love and politics.\nBut means testing would be a bureaucratic nightmare, and would give a patina of acceptability to an unacceptable system. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cuomo never proposed it during his 11 years as governor.\n",

        "content": "Andrew Cuomo thinks rent-stabilized apartments should be reserved for tenants who spend at least a third of their income on rent.\nOn Monday, Cuomo released details on \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d a proposal inspired by the fact that Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani lives in a rent-stabilized apartment.\nHere\u2019s the gist: Once a rent stabilized apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent.\nMamdani pays $2,300 a month, and makes $142,000 as a state Assembly member (meaning he spends well below that 30 percent threshold). In a press release, Cuomo said the law is needed to ensure stabilized apartments are going to New Yorkers in need and to \u201cstop the Zohran Mamdanis of the world from gaming the system and boxing out lower income New Yorkers.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s law wouldn\u2019t kick Mamdani out of his apartment, though. He\u2019d have to leave of his own accord before those rules would kick in.\nBefore I get into the particulars of the proposal, it is important to note that the mayor does not have the authority to make this kind of change, and a law limiting access to rent-stabilized apartments would be a hard sell to state lawmakers.\nCuomo framed the proposal as a complement to the elimination of high-income decontrol in 2019. That was another form of rooting out tenants from stabilized housing if they made too much.\nPrior to June 2019, one of the ways that stabilized units could be deregulated was if the rent exceeded a certain threshold and the existing tenant\u2019s gross income was $200,000 or more for two consecutive years. Cuomo\u2019s proposal \u201cbuilds on the important 2019 reform\u2026 by keeping these units in the system while making sure they are reserved for households that actually need affordable housing.\u201d\nI asked his spokesperson why this latest form of means testing wasn\u2019t paired with that change in 2019, when Cuomo was governor and had more sway over state law, but I didn\u2019t hear back.\nHigh-income decontrol was used less frequently by landlords than the other avenues.\nA 2020 Rent Guidelines Board report\nfound that 160 stabilized units had been deregulated in 2019 (before the rent law passed) through high-income decontrol. Nearly 8,000 were deregulated through another practice eliminated in 2019, high-rent vacancy decontrol, during that same period.\nAs with high-income decontrol, Cuomo\u2019s new version of means testing would be enforced by the state\u2019s already overextended housing regulator. There\u2019s also a question of whether adding these new rules will further slow down how quickly tenants can move in (the city recently\nmade changes\nto its housing lottery to cut back on the bureaucratic hurdles delaying tenant access to affordable apartments).\nIf the goal of \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d is to reshape the rent-stabilization system into an affordable housing program where housing is set aside for New Yorkers earning a certain amount, it is treading in the opposite direction of the city\u2019s other housing programs.\nUnder the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, for instance, rents are considered \u201caffordable\u201d because they are generally set so that tenants do not pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent. That\u2019s not always the case, and there is, of course, a whole debate around what is truly affordable housing, but that is a guiding principle for what is considered affordable.\n\nSomeone who pays more than 30 percent of their income on rent is considered rent-burdened, and requiring tenants to either be on the verge of that or beyond it in order to access stabilized housing arguably diminishes whatever \u201cstabilizing\u201d quality the housing provides.\nTenants\u2019 groups unsurprisingly criticized Cuomo\u2019s proposal. TenantBloc\u2019s Cea Weaver called means testing rent stabilization \u201ca backdoor plan to gut it, ensuring that the people who keep our city running \u2013 teachers, grocery clerks, delivery workers, nurses \u2013 get pushed out.\u201d Landlord groups also weren\u2019t too hot on the idea either. Leaders of the New York Apartment Association posted on social media that the proposal doesn\u2019t address what they see as the main issue: That rents are kept well below the costs of operating these properties.\n\u201cNY city and state government has used rent stabilized housing as its affordable housing program for decades,\u201d NYAA\u2019s Jay Martin posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s sucked it dry pretending to care about the quality of the housing for renters by attacking the owners for not conjuring revenue out of thin air.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What actions, within the mayor\u2019s actual power, would you like to see the next mayor take in connection with rent-stabilized housing? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The building that houses the Morrin Centre, an English-language library in Quebec City, was constructed in the early 1800s as one of the city\u2019s first prisons,\naccording to the centre\u2019s website\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 NYCHA will provide rental assistance to the nearly 5,500 low-income households who are set to lose aid after the federal government decided not to renew the Emergency Housing Voucher program, which is set to run out of funds five years ahead of schedule, according to\nGothamist\n. In order to fund this assistance, the housing agency will stop issuing new Section 8 vouchers to the thousands on the waiting list.\n\u2014 The Adams administration will close New York City\u2019s last hotel dedicated to housing homeless migrants, the Row NYC,\nGothamist\nreports. The hotel complex was the first of many to be converted during 2022\u2019s surge of asylum seekers. It joins the list of 64 other migrant shelters that have been shut down since last June.\n\u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani launched a \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour on Monday, framing himself as the strongest opponent to the president while attacking rival Andrew Cuomo over alleged ties to Trump,\namNY\nreports. Touting endorsements by Ruth Messinger, Keith Powers and Harvey Epstein, it\u2019s the latest development in Mamdani\u2019s attempt to center the race around opposition to Trump and his agenda. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit for\n$28 million\nat 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 4,500 square feet and last sold in 2023 as a new-construction unit for $24.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$54.5 million\nfor a commercial unit at 85 Jay Street. The rental Dumbo units are a part of the 728-unit, 21-story Front &amp; York condo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was for a penthouse at 255 East 77th Street for $24 million.

Chetrit is nearing completion on the 54-story, 632-unit luxury apartment tower on the site at 275 Southwest Sixth Street. At least two additional towers are planned on the remaining land. In 2022, Chetrit\nrevealed plans\ntapping David Grutman\u2019s Groot Hospitality to handle the food and beverage programming in the first tower.\nFlow will manage the apartment tower and lead development of the rest of the project as managing member of the majority ownership, according to a press release.\nThe final version of the deal is based on a $525 million market capitalization of the project, which is now called Flow on the Miami River, according to the release.\nNeumann, who co-founded WeWork, has been expanding his Flow empire in South Florida and abroad \u2014 including in\nSaudi Arabia\n.\n\nFlow is developing a three-tower apartment, office and retail project in Aventura; an apartment and commercial complex in El Portal; a 466-unit\nFlow-branded condo tower\nat Miami Worldcenter; and the completed Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale apartment buildings.\nFlow is partnering with Canada Global on more than 9 million square feet of mixed-use projects, including about 5,000 apartments, according to the release. Flow purchased 30 percent of Canada Global, an Israeli real estate investment company led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, for about $27 million, according to\nCalcalist\n.\nThe Chetrit family has had the Miami River project in the works for\nmore than a decade\n. The Miami City Commission\napproved\na major site rezoning and the project\u2019s development agreement in 2015.\nLate last year, Chetrit\npartnered\nwith Montreal-based Lotus International on Chetrit\u2019s long-awaited Miami Beach hotel project, the redevelopment of the Collins Park Hotel at 2000 Park Avenue. Chetrit also secured an $88 million refinancing for the loan backing the property.\nThe Chetrit family\u2019s empire includes the Chetrit Group and the Chetrit Organization, both of which have been tied up in litigation as of late. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is alleging the Chetrit Group, led by Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, allowed a Times Square property once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cdirtiest\u201d hotel to deteriorate after defaulting on a $233 million loan.\n",

        "content": "Another amenity-rich development has entered the Houston multifamily pipeline.\nDefine Living, a fitness-focused multifamily developer based in Houston, bought a 10.4-acre parcel from Wolff Companies last week with plans for a 388-unit project called Define Living: Park Row.\nThe four-story apartment complex will have one- and two-bedroom units, with amenities including a gym, infrared sauna, cold plunge, bicycle spa and \u201ca personal wellbeing coach for every resident.\u201d Developer Henry Richardson said he chose the site for its proximity to Terry Hershey Park and access to the Bayou Greenways, a city project that\u2019s expected to link Houston\u2019s major parks with trails.\nConstruction on the apartments will begin this year. Richardson\u2019s construction company, Blazer Building, expects to finish the apartment clubhouse by the end of next year, with the residential buildings coming later.\nRichardson, a yoga studio owner and former athlete, has developed about two dozen properties in Houston; however, this is only the second Define Living concept. The first opened at 1888 Brittmoore last year, and all 260 units were leased in 10 months, Richardson said.\n\nThis development has 4.4 acres more than the first, so it will give the company \u201cthe ability to build a little more expensive with our amenities,\u201d Richardson said.\nCarolyn Wolff Dorros of Wolff Companies, said Richardson snapped up the penultimate parcel available for development in the Energy Corridor, a business district in West Houston home to several major energy companies. The last undeveloped parcel is a 15.2-acre tract south of Richardson\u2019s purchase. So far, it\u2019s attracted the attention of entertainment and hospitality concepts, Dorros said.\nCheaper land in the exurbs is driving many multifamily developers outward, Dorros said.\n\u201cSome of the multifamily market has almost leapfrogged us,\u201d Dorros said. \u201cApartment developers are getting quite aggressive in terms of going further out, especially if there\u2019s good school districts.\u201d\nRelatively slower multifamily construction has helped the Houston market avoid rent declines that hit other Texas metros last year, especially Austin. However,\nHouston apartments below Class A have been losing occupants\nfor the past year.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio is one of the fastest-growing large cities in the nation, with rapid single-family and commercial development, but government entities and ranches are the largest landowners in the region, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nSan Antonio, known as Military City USA, has Air Force and Army installations that now comprise Joint Base San Antonio (Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base and Camp Bullis). Other federal holdings such as those owned by the U.S. Postal Service, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior, National Park Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers make the federal government the largest landowner in the San Antonio metropolitan area, which includes Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Medina and Wilson counties.\nThe State of Texas is next in terms of property ownership in the region, and it\u2019s easy to see why, when considering the number of state parks and natural areas dotting the region. The Texas General Land Office holdings include the Alamo (four other historic San Antonio missions fall under the National Park Service). Other landowning state agencies in the region include the Department of Criminal Justice, Department of Transportation, Texas Historical Commission, Permanent School Fund, Veterans Land Board and National Guard Armory Board, plus state healthcare facilities such as the San Antonio State Hospital.\nThe city of San Antonio is the next largest landowner, with dozens of city parks, golf courses, nature trails, bicycle paths and city infrastructure facilities and government buildings. San Antonio International Airport and Stinson-Mission Municipal Airport are owned by the city, as are the Alamodome and Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center.\n\nOther top landowners include ranchland and other large swaths of rural Texas that have been held by families for generations. The George Robinson-owned 74Ranch is a 27,000-acre area managed for hunting game animals. The Peeler family\u2019s Peeler Ranch comprises 21,000 acres of cattle ranching for wagyu and akaushi breeds. The E.L. Ranch, owned by Steven and Lee Stockseth, spans more than 10,900 acres and operates as a cattle operation and also offers whitetail deer hunting. The next five-biggest land owners in the region hold 8,000 to 10,000 acres each.\nWhile many of these ranches have been intact over many decades, prices and competition for land in the region have spiked since the pandemic as people left cities while investors sought to park capital in large properties in partnership with farmers and ranchers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal for 477,101 square feet of offices works out to about $252 per square foot. CBRE Investment Management acquired the property in 2016 for $256 million, or about $537 per square foot, per CO.\nPasadena Towers consists of two Class A office buildings at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard linked by a courtyard. The property features tenant amenities including a 3,000-square-foot fitness center, a 2,000-square foot conference room and a seven-level parking garage. Asking rent is about $4.35 per square foot per month, according to\nCBRE\n.\nThe deal marks the largest-ever investment by Seal Beach-based Harbor Associates and is one of the largest office investments by square footage in Greater Los Angeles so far this year, according to CO. In the first half of the year, the L.A. metro area closed $1.4 billion in office sales; in the same period last year, L.A. registered just $287 million in office sales.\n\nAlso valued at far less, last month, the nine-story Pasadena Office Tower at 150 South Robles Avenue was reappraised at $23 million, marking a 59 percent decrease from its appraisal on the property a decade ago,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nOccupancy at the Pasadena Office Tower dropped from 93 percent in 2015 to 69 percent last year. The five largest leases, making up nearly 40 percent of the building, are set to expire at the end of 2027, including arrangements with the City of Pasadena and the California Department of Rehabilitation.\nOffice vacancy across Greater Los Angeles ticked up marginally to 24.4 percent last quarter, up from 24.1 percent in the\nsame period\nlast year, according to\nColliers\n.

Hilton Union Square is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms, while the Parc 55, a Hilton property, is among the top five with 1,024 rooms, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n.\nHilton Union Square at 333 O\u2019Farrell Street and Parc 55 at 55 Cyril Magnin Street, both in the Union Square neighborhood, were previously owned by Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, an affiliate of Hilton Worldwide Holdings. Park\ndefaulted on its $725 million mortgage\non the properties in 2023.\nA previous court order set a deadline of July 29 for the sale but no deal materialized. On Aug. 6, a judge approved a request to extend a court-appointed receiver\u2019s ability to sell the properties until Oct. 29, marking the fourth time the sale deadline has been extended.\nThe receiver, Michelle Russo of Hotel Asset Value Enhancement, has been looking to sell the two properties for nearly two years on behalf of Wilmington Trust, a trustee for special servicer Wells Fargo. An attorney for Russo declined to comment on the identity of the buyer to the Chronicle but said a motion to approve the sale will be filed \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nSeveral\nhotels across the Bay Area\nhave suffered financial setbacks in the years since the pandemic\u2019s outbreak. Many properties in the East Bay and South Bay, as well as San Francisco itself, have fallen into loan defaults and foreclosure proceedings over the past year.\nHotel sales\nin general in California declined 7.4 percent in the first half of the year from the same period the year prior, according to Atlas Hospitality Group. In the Bay Area, the largest hotel sales in Alameda County and Santa Clara County in the first six months of the year were foreclosure sales.\nLast month, the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\n, a 500-room hotel was taken back by lender Invesco in a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million. In May,\nBrightSpire Capital seized\nthe 541-room Signia by Hilton in downtown\nSan Jose\nin a foreclosure that valued the property at $80 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Residential amenities include a pool on the second floor.\nXu did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nUnited bought the site from Steve Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust in 2023 for $71.1 million, a 16 percent discount on the $85 million the real estate investment trust initially sought for the property. Shortly after the acquisition, the developer\nreleased renderings\nfor a three-building mixed-use complex at the site, planning for 706 units at the time.\nXu\u2019s firm is best known for developing the 67-story, 802-unit\nSkyline Tower in Long Island City\n, the tallest completed building in the borough (set to be surpassed by BLDG Management\u2019s The Orchard in the coming years). More than 90 percent of the units at the property, completed in 2022, have sold.\nUnited began offering complimentary Porsches to prospective buyers to move the building\u2019s unsold penthouse units.\nOther prominent projects for Corona-based United include The Cube at 24-01 43rd Avenue in Long Island City and Whitestone Manor at 137-08 31st Road in Flushing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The onetime home of Manhattan\u2019s ultra-exclusive Core Club is hitting the market.\nRFR Holding, led by Aby Rosen, is marketing the 34,000-square-foot commercial condo at 66 East 55th Street through Rudder Property Group and BK Real Estate Advisors, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The listing comes with a $40 million price tag, or $1,176 per square foot.\nThe condo occupies the base of Park Avenue Place, a 45-story, 76-unit condo tower Rosen co-developed in 2006 with Davis, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. Between Park and Madison avenues, the space still bears the high-end buildout that made the Core Club a see-and-be-seen address for financiers, designers and power brokers when it opened in 2005.\nDesigned by Stonely Pelsinski Architects Neukomm, the interiors boast a screening room, restaurant, full commercial kitchen, library, spa, fitness center, outdoor terrace, and a network of lounges and meeting rooms, all of which appear to be included in the sale. Annual common charges run $158,000 and property taxes are around $862,000 this year.\nThe Plaza District asset could be a turnkey option for another private club or hospitality operator, a segment starved for premium space in Midtown.\n\u201cTrophy deals of this caliber will transact,\u201d broker Brandon Charnas told CO, noting the scarcity of large-scale food and beverage venues in the area; Charnas is not involved in the property\u2019s marketing.\n\nRudder Property Group\u2019s Michael Rudder and Justin Harris are teaming with BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal, Ryan Candel and Tom Brady on the listing.\nRosen seeded Core Club\u2019s launch, and early members included Stephen Schwarzman, Kenneth Cole, Sir Norman Foster and Roger Waters. But the pandemic upended operations: in 2021 the club and Sweetgreen, a tenant in another condo in the building, stopped paying rent, leading to a\nforeclosure action\non a $25 million mortgage.\nRFR ultimately refinanced with Signature Bank and settled the case in early 2022. Core Club relocated to 711 Fifth Avenue, reopening in 2023 before promptly sparring in court with landlord Michael Shvo.\nLast week, a judge ruled that the owners of Core Club\nowe Shvo nearly $1 million\n, a decision the club vowed to appeal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Siblings Sean and Nicole Mirmelli suffered a significant setback in their legal battle to kill a 99-year ground lease tied to one of two parcels underneath the Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach.\nLast week, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull dismissed four of the five counts in the Mirmellis\u2019 May lawsuit against hotel owner Chisholm Properties South Beach, led by\nRobert Balzebre\n. The dismissed counts included breach of contract, commercial eviction and slander of title.\nRebull essentially denied the\nMirmellis\n\u2019 request to cancel the ground lease, as well as appoint a receiver to take over management of the parcel at 1731 Collins Avenue that makes up half of the Surfcomber assemblage. Chisholm and the Mirmellis, through a trust, each own 50 percent of the 1731 Collins Avenue land.\nWhen Chisholm bought the three-story hotel for $1.4 million in 2004, the firm separately assumed the ground lease at 1731 Collins Avenue that allowed for construction of the 186-key\nArt Deco\nbuilding completed in 1948, records show. The deal also included the second parcel at 1717 Collins Avenue, which Chisholm owns outright.\nIn an emailed statement, Mirmelli attorney Joseph Pardo said his clients will seek a rehearing \u201cand will appeal if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe there was an ongoing breach because the lease restrictions are covenants that run with the land,\u201d Pardo said.\nAbbey Kaplan, a lawyer representing Chisholm, said the Mirmellis\u2019 lawsuit was \u201ca frivolous and misguided attempt to unwind a long-standing lease.\u201d\nIn their lawsuit, the Mirmellis alleged that Chisholm breached the ground lease by altering the building\u2019s condition that did not conform to the 99-year agreement. Chisholm also was allegedly hit with liens on the property and obtained an unauthorized $20.5 million loan in 2014 that was secured by the building and the two parcels.\nThe Mirmellis, whose cousin\nAndrew Mirmelli\nis a prolific Miami Beach real estate investor, accused Chisholm of including an estoppel letter with a purported forgery of Nicole Mirmelli\u2019s signature with the mortgage documents. In an affidavit, she denied signing the letter, which verified the current status of the ground lease.\nChisholm\u2019s lawyer disputed the allegation. \u201cOur client received the fully executed Estoppel Certificate directly from the Mirmellis,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cAnd a notary testified under oath that he personally witnessed the signing. Any alleged misdeed was attributable to the Mirmellis.\u201d\nRebull ruled that the Mirmellis\u2019 claims about the liens and the 2014 mortgage were barred by a statute of limitations. The judge also determined that the Mirmellis lacked standing to enforce the ground lease without Chisholm\u2019s consent.",

Newmark broker Keely Polczynski told the outlet that the rents have been rising in that area as the multifamily market grows.\nIn terms of the available retail space,\u00a0 most is in smaller spaces surrounding the anchor tenants. Mariano\u2019s lease is corporately guaranteed by Kroger, something that Polczynski said is a \u201cbig vote of confidence to the performance of that location,\u201d and the property carries average lease terms of six years.\nBucksbaum Properties and Structured Development received roughly $170 million in construction loans in 2014 for the build.\nThe offering comes at a time when retail space in Chicago is filling up fast. Brokerage Marcus &amp; Milichap forecasts\nChicago-area\nretail vacancies will fall to 4.5 percent, the lowest rate since 2006. On top of that, the estimated 500,000 square feet of new retail space expected to come online in the Chicago area will mostly be suburban developments, making Chicago-proper retail vacancies scarcer.\nNewCity can expect no shortage of customers to its tenant businesses, as two apartment high rises are\nplanned\nin the area, including a\n500-unit apartment tower\nat Clybourn Place and a 400-unit tower at 1565 N.

        "content": "One of the country\u2019s biggest apartment owners is pitching a large Manhattan portfolio that would be insulated should Zohran Mamdani follow through on his campaign promise to\nfreeze the rent\n.\nUDR, the Colorado-based multifamily REIT, and its partner MetLife are eyeing up to $500 million for a group of rental buildings around Columbus Circle,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFour of the five buildings are free market. And the fifth is subject to an older 421a agreement under which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting their legal rent limits.\n\u201cWith no exposure to income-restriction and minimal impact from Rent Guidelines Board limitations, the portfolio benefits from robust, market-driven rent growth across all assets,\u201d read an offering memo from Newmark, where a team led by Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nThe offering comes as investors anxiously eye New York\u2019s mayoral election in November. Assembly member Mamdani won a decisive victory in the Democratic party primary in June, in part by promising to freeze rents on the city\u2019s roughly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments. This comes amid increased rent-stabilized distress, with that housing stock seeing foreclosures and delinquencies rise precipitously, most of which is attributed to the 2019 law that essentially blocked substantial rent increases.\n\nRepresentatives for UDR, MetLife and Newmark did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The REIT, led by CEO Tom Toomey, is eyeing a price of $450-500 million for the 710-unit portfolio \u2014 either through an outright sale or a recapitalization.\nThe buildings are 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue, as well as 801 Amsterdam Avenue.\nUDR teamed up with MetLife in 2012 to buy the portfolio from Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar Management and the Chetrit Group for\n$635 million\n.\nIt\u2019s not clear why the portfolio\u2019s value has declined, but this wouldn\u2019t be UDR\u2019s first loss in recent memory. In January, the company sold an apartment building at 395 Leonard Street in Brooklyn for $127.5 million, a slight discount to the $130.4 million the company had paid six years earlier.\n\u201cThe approximately 5 percent decline in value for Leonard Pointe in the six years UDR owned the property compares to a 15-20 percent decline for Green Street\u2019s New York Metro commercial property price index, suggesting Brooklyn property values have held up better than other sub-markets in NYC,\u201d the REIT said in an announcement at the time.\n",

A slight majority unfolded in the Big Apple; the New York properties are 88.1 percent leased, the best mark in three years, though the data appears to exclude 1.6 million square feet vacant at the renovating 60 Wall Street.\nLast week, Cushman &amp; Wakefield\nsigned a 130,000-square-foot lease\nat Paramount\u2019s 31 West 52nd Street, where it will relocate its New York office in late 2026.

Pritzker also expressed an openness to a separate state program that allows companies to reap the benefits of expanded state sales tax revenue that a project generates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate what the costs are for the people of Illinois to do this, the benefits that come from attracting businesses as a result of providing that ability to use those tax dollars,\u201d he said.\nThe comments came ahead of the legislature\u2019s fall veto session. In the Spring regular season, similar efforts fizzled out before the legislature adjourned.\nPritzker reiterated that \u201ctaxpayers shouldn\u2019t be propping up what now is an $8.5 billion-valued business.\u201d\n\nWithout the tax relief framework, team officials say they \u201care not able to proceed forward\u201d with plans for a new stadium.\nThe Bears originally proposed building a lakefront stadium in Chicago but because the plans required $900 million in direct subsidies from the state and $1.5 billion in public infrastructure spending, it failed to gain any political support.\nThe team has since pivoted to planning a $5 billion mixed-use development at the former Arlington International Racecourse site, which the organization bought for $197 million in 2023.\nEven with Pritzker\u2019s openness to the PILOT bill and similar legislative proposals, key members of the legislature\u2019s influential Chicago delegation are committed to voting against the measures.\n\u201cTrump is cutting Medicaid and housing.

        "content": "An East Austin hotel that has been closed for 50 years is set for redevelopment by the business partners behind the restaurants Paperboy and Loudmouth Pizza.\nRobert Brown and Ryan Harms of Daybreak Hospitality bought the site of the former Deluxe Hotel, established in the 1940s and shuttered in 1975, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. They bought the hotel at 1101 Navasota Street and the adjacent lot at 1105 Navasota Street from Jo Baylor. The location is near their restaurants.\nThe buyers envision a hotel with some condominium units. The old hotel will be torn down to make way for a five-story structure. Daybreak Hospitality is still seeking capital and development partners for the project.\nQuestions remain about the timeline and further details of the project, including the number of hotel keys and condos. An architecture firm offices in the location, and it would be at least two years before the building could be demolished.\n\nClayton Korte is working on the conceptual planning and branding of the development. Kempt Studio, the firm that designed Daybreak Hospitality\u2019s restaurants, will also design the hotel. The buyers tapped Lucky Find Hospitality to guide the hotel operations, and it is working with Civilitude to secure engineering and other permits.\nThe seller said it was important to her that the legacy of the hotel be carried into its next iteration. Located in historically Black\nEast Austin\n, the hotel served many touring musicians, such as the Bobby Blue Bland, B.B. King, Etta James, Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters, the Five Royales, Little Willie Jones and Big Mama Thornton, according to city documents.\nBrown and Harms have seen prior success in their\nEast Austin\nlocations. Paperboy began as a food truck in the area, and as a brick and mortar sees lines out the door at the consistently busy brunch spot. They opened a\nsecond location\nof Paperboy on South Lamar Boulevard this year.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In recent weeks, it appeared the cards were firmly stacked against Bally\u2019s and its pursuit of a casino in the Bronx. But Mayor Eric Adams had an ace up his sleeve and the City Council is prepared to watch how the rest of the game unfolds.\nThe casino plan at Ferry Point Park in Throggs Neck received a second shot at success after the City Council didn\u2019t attempt to override the mayor\u2019s\ncritical veto\nof the body\u2019s previous rejection of the pitch, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A 10-day clock for the council to act lapsed without action on Monday.\nThe surprise move comes after the council\u2019s initial 29-9 vote\nagainst the Bally\u2019s proposal\n, most of the legislative body in lockstep with local councilmember Kristy Marmorato.\nThat July 14 vote centered on a zoning approval Bally\u2019s needed to for its $4 billion proposal, since an applicable portion of the site is on city-owned land. The zoning changes include demapping the site as city parkland and granting a designation to allow a mixed-use development.\nBut in a video interview Wednesday with\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nPublisher Amir Korangy on July 30, Adams confirmed that he would veto the City Council\u2019s vote. The City Council needed a two-thirds vote to override the mayor\u2019s veto, a bar higher than the initial vote.\n\nBally\u2019s has not commented on the latest development, but Marmarato in a statement last week expressed deep disappointment and promised to keep \u201cfighting this proposal at every stage.\u201d\nThis is only the fifth time since 1989 that the mayor has vetoed council rejections of land-use applications. Of the four previous instances, only once \u2014 in 1992 \u2014 did the council fail to override the veto.\nZoning changes need to be approved before the end of next month, the deadline for a six-member Community Advisory Committee to vote on the proposal. That vote will determine which casino proposals head to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which ultimately decides the applications to receive the three downstate casino licenses up for grabs from the state.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to expend public capital, time and energy on a thing where the council won\u2019t have the final say,\u201d a council official told the outlet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The neighborhood is known for its Mid-Century Modern designs carved into the Santa Monica Mountains above Sunset Boulevard.\nDavid Parnes and James Harris, who helm Carolwood Estate\u2019s Bond Street Partners team, hold the listing.\nBraunstein originally placed the property on the market last September for $25.9 million, after purchasing it for $3.4 million in 2017 and then building anew, according to property records.\nIf the closing price is anything above $5.3 million, the deal triggers the Measure United to House Los Angeles (ULA) tax. The tiered assessment levies a 4 percent tax on all real estate transactions starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more. The fee, which is billed as a mansion tax, applies only to deals within the city of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Tigertail Road property sits on a little over an acre with the home spanning more than 14,000 square feet. It has six beds and 10 baths with views of the Getty Center running the length of the 200-foot-long lot.\nOther highlights include a herringbone-design motor court, living room anchored with a stone fireplace and olive tree, primary suite with its own wraparound terrace, wellness center, elevator and infinity pool.\nSitting in the No. 2 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts is 708 North Rexford Drive in Beverly Hills, which is listed for $16.9 million.\nCarolwood\u2019s Brett Lawyer holds the listing.\nProperty records show the seller is Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernethy and his wife Rosemary Abernethy, who bought the home in 2019 for $10.4 million.\nThe couple placed the six-bed, 10-bath home on the market in March for $19.9 million.\nIt\u2019s nearly 7,000 square feet in the Beverly Hills\nFlats neighborhood\nwith a separate wing for staff, pool, guest house, gardens and privacy hedges out front.\nAcross Los Angeles County, 27 homes went into contract last week, which was good for $191.2 million in asking dollar volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report. That\u2019s a hike 186 percent from the same period a year ago, when 16 contracts were inked.",

The buyer, so far not publicly identified, has been working on the deals with Los Angeles-based real estate firm Weston James Group.\nThe investor honed in on La Costa beachfront lots with 40-foot frontages at minimum for future development. Architects are already working on drawing up plans, according to\nThe New York Post\n. The lots weren\u2019t publicly listed for sale, and those who sold reportedly weren\u2019t interested in rebuilding homes, seawalls and onsite wastewater treatment systems, leading them to get rid of the properties off the market.\nThe unnamed buyer is purportedly willing to deal with the issues of\nrebuilding\nin hopes that new construction will attract wealthy buyers.\n\u201cHe started building a team on his end of expediters, architects and kind of figured out what the best size lots and frontage would be to build on to eventually resell,\u201d Weston Littlefield of Weston James Group told\nRealtor.com\n. \u201cI\u2019d say probably about 50 percent had sentimental value to their properties just based on memories, or their parents passed it down to them. But a lot of them, ultimately, just didn\u2019t want to go through the rebuilding process because of how long they knew it was going to take to really come back.\u201d\n\nOf nearly 350 homeowners in the Palisades and Eaton fire zones, nearly 80 percent in the Palisades burn zone, including Malibu,\nplanned to rebuild\ntheir homes, but 70 percent in the area said they may not return if rebuilding took three years or longer, according to a May\nsurvey\nby Project Recovery. In the Palisades burn zone, residents\u2019 biggest concern was the \u201clack of leadership\u201d from city and county officials to complete recovery and rebuilding.\nMeanwhile, in Altadena, anonymous buyers \u2014 likely including some developers \u2014 are similarly\nsnapping up burned lots\n, with many purchases being made through trusts and limited liability companies.\nIn the seven months since the blazes ripped through the Pacific Palisades and environs, Los Angeles County has issued 16 rebuilding permits in the area, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The broker on the bankrupt, half-built Oceanside Plaza in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles says the property has drawn two viable bidders in coming months,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThat\u2019s down from a list of 17 interested parties last year, when a\nmanaged bid process commenced\nto sell Oceanwide Holdings\u2019 1101 South Flower Street project, according to Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski, whose team is marketing the property along with Hilco Real Estate.\nTHe list narrowed as most of the would-be buyers \u201cat the end of the day they couldn\u2019t scare up the money,\u201d Tarczynski said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, you want to talk, show us the money!\u2019\u201d\nThe price of admission includes $450 million to acquire the fully entitled site \u2014 which already has $1.2 billion spent on construction \u2014 and roughly $1 billion to complete it.\n\u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d the broker added.\nNow however there are two serious \u201ccompeting bidders,\u201d he said. They are both real estate development companies, one from the U.S. and one from abroad, Tarczynski said, declining to provide any more details.\nThe broker said he anticipates closing the deal by the end of the year, though he\npreviously said\nhe was \u201choping it will happen before the close of Q2.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the 1.5-million-square-foot, graffiti-ridden project, which spans nearly a full city block across from the Los Angeles Convention Center and the Crypto.com arena, began in 2015 and progressed to two half-built towers in fits and starts before landing in bankruptcy due to financial issues, and claims of\nunpaid work\n. Everything has been on hold at the site since January 2019, according to the offering memorandum, with the project\nfacing foreclosure\nin 2023 and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year..\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why the project lost its funding,\u201d Tarczynski said. \u201cIt\u2019s because China took a different approach to managing its money, its currency, and midstream in the construction, they shut the window on currency exchange, the one with the dollar. So it became increasingly hard to pull money out of China.\u201d\nOceanwide owes about $400 million to creditors, according to court filings, including $180 million to EB-5 visa investors, $175 million to contractors led by Lendlease and $18 million to pay off county taxes,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nThe fully entitled mixed-use project in Downtown Los Angeles includes a 49-story Park Hyatt hotel with 32 residential condominium levels, multifamily and retail components across three mixed-use towers, plus a fourth, three-level retail building, according to the offering memorandum. The complex was designed by CallisonRTKL, now operating as Arcadis.\nAll in, the project will have 504 residential units, 183 hotel rooms, roughly 160,000 square feet of retail space, 1,412 parking spaces and 57,522-square-foot prominent electronic display.\n\u201cYou have a project that\u2019s already $1.2 billion built and it\u2019s apartments and condos and hotel and retail and you\u2019re getting it for a huge bargain \u2014 picking it up for $450 million,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd your entitlements are rock solid in place, ready to go.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s compound in a tree-lined neighborhood in Palo Alto isn\u2019t sitting right with some neighbors.\nFor nearly 15 years, the Meta CEO has spent more than $110 million to buy at least 11 houses next to each other on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue in Palo Alto\u2019s Crescent Park neighborhood,\nThe New York Times\nreported. At times, the Facebook founder has paid as much as $14.5 million per property.\nFive of those parcels became a compound with a main house for him, his wife Priscilla Chan and his daughters, complete with guest homes, gardens, a pickleball court and a pool. The others are largely vacant, with one home used for entertainment and outdoor parties and the other operating for years as an unpermitted private school.\nUnderneath it all is 7,000 square feet of basement space that neighbors refer to as bunkers. Over the past eight years, constant construction has clogged the streets and plagued neighbors with noise. The neighbors also reportedly deal with cameras from Zuckerberg\u2019s property pointing at their homes as well as security guards patrolling the neighborhood.\n\u201cNo neighborhood wants to be occupied,\u201d Michael Kieschnick, whose home on Hamilton Avenue is bound on three sides by property owned by Zuckerberg, told the Times. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood.\u201d Zuckerberg has offered to buy Kieschnick\u2019s home for over 30 years, but the homeowner has refused.\n\nThe city of Palo Alto has reportedly not stepped in to block Zuckerberg\u2019s expansion, purportedly going so far as to let the tech titan skirt local regulations and even get police to block off street parking.\n\u201cBillionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules \u2014 Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique, except that they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d Kieschnick said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a mystery why the city has been so feckless.\u201d\nIn addition to his Palo Alto compound, Zuckerberg also owns 2,300 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, where he is building a compound with two mansions, tree houses connected by rope bridges and an underground shelter, as well as another compound on Lake Tahoe. This year, he dropped $23 million in cash for a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Washington, D.C.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Shoma Group proposes a 201-unit Live Local Act apartment project in Coral Gables, marking the first known development in the city under the state\u2019s affordable and workforce housing law.\nCoral Gables-based Shoma wants to build the 16-story Ponce 8 on a 0.8-acre site at 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street, near the Douglas Entrance office campus, according to the developer\u2019s news release. Designed by PPKS Architects, Ponce 8 will include 18,000 square feet of commercial space.\nShoma is led by married couple Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee.\nStephanie Shojaee\njoined \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d as a\ncast member\nlate last year.\nShoma has the two-lot property under contract for an undisclosed price.\nThe sellers are Jilk Investments and ABC Development, both led by Jorge Gonzalez; and S17TPA Corporation, led by Adolfo, Alain and Amanda Bonvecchio, according to property and state corporate records.\nAt Ponce 8, 40 percent of units, or about 81, will be designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income, according to Shoma. That\u2019s in line with the\nLive Local Act\u2019s\nrequirement.\nThe state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows bigger projects than permitted by a site\u2019s zoning as long as the buildings include apartments at workforce and affordable rents. At a minimum, 40 percent of the units have to be for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI for at least 30 years.\n\nThe Live Local Act is giving Ponce 8 more density and bigger floor area ratio (FAR), a measurement of a project\u2019s size. Shoma also is using Coral Gables\u2019 Mediterranean Bonus, a zoning designation that allows for two additional stories to 16 levels and also grants a bigger FAR.\nThe city\u2019s Mediterranean Bonus is for projects with designs that align with and invoke\nCoral Gables\n\u2019 traditional Mediterranean Revival architectural style, according to the city. Coral Gables was planned and developed by the late George Merrick.\nConstruction of Ponce 8 is expected to start in the second quarter of next year, according to Shoma. Completion is expected in the second quarter of 2028.\nShoma\u2019s\nother planned projects include the 24-story, 333-unit\nShoma Bay\ncondo tower with a Publix and an additional 15,600 square feet of retail in North Bay Village. This month, the firm scored a\n$30 million\npredevelopment loan, used to pay off existing financing on the site at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nIn March, Shoma scrapped plans to redevelop a closed auto dealership at 3650 Bird Road in Miami, selling the site to 13th Floor Investments, LeFrak Organization and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group for\n$35 million\n. Shoma had paid $34 million in 2022 for the site, which is approved for a pair of 40-story high-rises with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.\nAcross South Florida, developers are seizing on the Live Local Act to supersize buildable capacity on sites. In May, Raanan Katz\u2019s RK Centers listed for sale the 8.1-acre former Sears at 3655 Southwest 22nd Street in Miami for more than\n$100 million\n, after getting a 1,050-unit Live Local Act project approved for the site.\nSpanish developer Pablo Castro and his local partner Laura Tauber, of Bay Harbor Islands-based Taubco, plan a\n4,032-unit\nLive Local Act project with seven 35-story towers at\u00a0 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue in West Little River. It\u2019s the biggest known planned Live Local Act project in South Florida.\n",

The price for the home, at 1908 North Halsted Street, works out to $478 per square foot.\nThe five-bedroom home was built in 1883 and features red brick siding and stone window lintels. The interior has been remodeled, and there is a roof-top deck and an alley-side garage.\nThe home was listed May 6 and went under contract May 14 for $5,000 above the asking price. Ryan Gossett and Omar Gonzalez of Compass represented the seller, Colin Marshall, and the Isbaras were represented by Souk Supantavong of Coldwell Banker.\n\nIsbara, who started her job a year ago, is an exhibited artist and was previously provost of Otis College of Art and Design in California.\nRecent sales and listings of Lincoln Park single-family homes have ranged in the single digit millions, most notably a 7,800-square-foot mansion on a\ndouble lot\nthat listed in June for $7.2 million, more than 30 percent above its 2022 sales price.

Residents, block associations, tenant groups, and small businesses will determine priorities through a participatory budgeting process.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from many members of the community, who support our objective but wanted assurances that it would be administered fairly and in a way that truly allowed all of the West Side community\u2019s voice to be heard,\u201d the developers said in a statement\n\nMichael Phillips, president of the fund and of Jamestown, a real estate firm, said the influx could \u201csignificantly expand our impact\u201d and promised a focus on Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nThe $1.5 million annual commitment and the cut of casino profits hinge on SL Green landing one of three state licenses to open its gaming and entertainment complex at 1515 Broadway.\nPublic hearings for the SL Green bid and a competing proposal from Silverstein Properties are set for Aug. 13 and Aug. 27, respectively. A six-member community advisory committee is expected to vote on advancing the proposals by the end of September.\nThe Manhattan Plaza pledge drew skepticism, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, especially after news that the complex\u2019s tenant association president had been offered \u2014 and says she declined \u2014 a $20,000-a-month consulting contract from Roc Nation.\nThe reversal marks one of the first significant concessions from any casino bidder since the advisory process began.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Kylli is in danger of losing a 22-story office tower in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District.\nLenders for the building at 225 Bush Street have filed a lawsuit against the Burlingame-based company to place the office tower into receivership, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nKylli, the U.S. branch of Chinese investor Genzon, defaulted on a $350 million loan backed by the property last November. Its future hung in the balance as lenders mulled their next move. In March, lender\nDeutsche Bank looked to sell\nthe distressed building.\nThe building\u2019s lenders are looking to pursue judicial foreclosure, according to the Business Times. In doing so, they would be able to recoup all of the $350 million in debt backed by 225 Bush. Kylli has owned a majority stake in the building since 2014.\nIt\u2019s not the only option they\u2019re open to, however. The lawsuit mentions the possibility of lenders pursuing a nonjudicial foreclosure where they would receive only what the building might sell for at a future sale to repay the $350 million loan.\n\nThe lenders have asked the court to appoint Douglas Wilson Companies as 225 Bush\u2019s receiver. The San Diego-based firm was appointed earlier this year as receiver for Parkmerced, the largest apartment complex in San Francisco.\nHow much the 225 Bush building, constructed for Standard Oil in the early 20th century, would fetch in a purchase remains to be seen. Its appraised value fell to $153 million in December 2024, a\nnearly 75 percent drop\nfrom the $589 million it was appraised at in 2019, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times.\nOccupancy at the office tower fell to 43 percent at the end of last year, as did revenues, tumbling from $40.3 million when the building was fully occupied in 2019 to $21.3 million last year, according to the Business Times. If it goes up for sale, the 580,000-square-foot building would be one of the largest office properties to hit the market in San Francisco post-pandemic.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dallas City Council is set to decide what kind of investment and development could be built in a West Oak Cliff neighborhood, in a case dividing residents on how to shape the future of the community.\nThe rezoning case affects 35.25 acres centered on the intersection of Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive. It would allow mixed-use and small multifamily buildings and encourage pedestrian-friendly development, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. City officials have viewed the area as ripe for rezoning for such developments since 2019, and it\u2019s part of the city\u2019s broader efforts to encourage density and walkability in development.\nThe vote also comes as Texas Senate Bill 840, which takes effect Sept. 1, will require Texas cities to\nallow\nresidential development in nonresidential zones.\nWest, whose district includes the area, pitched the zoning change as protection for single-family homes and small businesses from large developments.\n\nThe rezoning could encourage development of vacant lots. A quarter of lots in the rezoning area are vacant, West said.\nThe rezoning would limit building heights to 50 feet and allow for only small-scale multifamily projects. Drive\u2013thrus would not be not allowed, and developments would be required to build out landscaping buffer zones and sidewalks. City Council\neliminated parking minimums\nfor smaller scale projects in May.\nThe zoning change comes with concerns about displacement and gentrification of the area\u2019s predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods. A petition opposing the rezoning circulated earlier this year, posted online by the Automotive Association of Oak Cliff. It garnered more than 1,000 signatures. The petition claimed the zoning changes could eventually spike property costs and drive out residents.\nFour of six neighborhood associations in West Oak Cliff signed letters of support for the rezoning, however, and the other two have not yet taken a stance on the matter.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Charles Cohen\u2019s Midtown East office building is continuing its valuation freefall.\nThe 31-story office building at 750 Lexington Avenue was recently valued at just $41 million \u2014 less than 14 percent of its $300 million valuation a decade ago, according to Morningstar Credit. It\u2019s the latest blow to the property after a lender won a judgement in a foreclosure case on the building last month. Cohen, a billionaire, personally guaranteed a $130 million loan on the property in 2015.\n750 Lex was constructed in 1988, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 59th Street, and is also called 1 International Plaza. Cohen Brothers Realty owned the building for decades and kept offices there.\nBut things started to go south during the pandemic as occupancy began to slip. Both its retail tenant, fashion brand Zara, and office tenants vacated the space in 2022. Cohen fell behind on payments.\nThen in 2023, beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying rent. The building, which was once fully leased, fell to 69 percent occupancy. Net operating income was a quarter of what it was when the loan originated.\nWhen WeWork declared bankruptcy, Cohen negotiated a lease amendment that shortened the term and tied rent to the revenue from the office, according to Morningstar. But the next month, the building\u2019s valuation dropped to $50 million.\n\nAs of March, expenses have overtaken revenue at the office. Net operating income, which does not include debt service, is in the red at -$744,915, according to Morningstar.\nSpecial servicer LNR Partners filed a foreclosure case against the property last summer and won summary judgement last month. Cohen failed to pay taxes on the property, provide financial statements, and certify that his net worth and liquidity have not fallen, LNR said in its complaint. The servicer is pursuing foreclosure at the same time as it tries to work out the loan with the borrower, according to information provided by Morningstar.\nNeither LNR Partners nor an attorney for Cohen in the foreclosure case immediately responded to a request for comment.\nElsewhere, Cohen has been waging war with Fortress Capital. After the lender sued Cohen last year for defaulting on a $534 million portfolio that he had guaranteed, the firm won a $187 million judgement in February.\nCohen\u2019s personal net worth has sunk 57 percent since 2023, according to Forbes. It is now estimated at $1.6 billion.\n",

        "content": "And then there were eight. Again.\nThe Bally\u2019s Bronx casino proposal is back in the game just one month after City Council killed it.\nThe Council rejected the zoning changes Bally\u2019s needed to move forward with its $4 billion casino complex in the Bronx, but Mayor Eric Adams\nvetoed\nthe decision.\nThough Council leadership criticized the mayor\u2019s move, underscoring a broader battle brewing over the future of member deference, the body did not decide to take up the issue. The Council ran out the clock on its opportunity to override the veto, so the proposal will move forward with the seven other casino contenders.\nMeanwhile, SL Green Realty backtracked on its pledge to provide tenants of the apartment complex Manhattan Plaza with $22.5 million over the next 15 years, along with .5 percent of its Times Square casino\u2019s annual profits,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. Instead, if SL Green ultimately receives one of the three state casino licenses up for grabs, it will provide that money to the West Side Community Fund, a charity whose donors include Related Companies, Jamestown, Brookfield Properties as well as other real estate firms and major corporations.\nThe original arrangement was unusual, but added to the list of big promises casino teams are making in hopes of building goodwill and gaining an edge over the competition. Manhattan Plaza is home to mostly performing artists \u2014\u00a0who could potentially counter the opposition SL Green is facing from the Broadway League. But some residents were skeptical and reportedly wanted to ensure that the money would be administered fairly and would benefit the community beyond their building.\nThe casino competition has dragged on for years and is expected to conclude by the end of the year. In our\nlatest issue of the magazine\n, I detailed some of the other twists and turns of the competition and how some teams may walk away with some wins even if they lose out on a casino license.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWith tariffs now in effect, what construction materials are being hit the hardest/how are developers and construction companies coping?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Big is the name of the largest oyster found in a New York waterway in possibly 100 years,\naccording to the New York Times\n. At last weigh-in, Big was 2.63 pounds. That\u2019s down from the 2.8 pounds it weighed last year, when the Hudson River Park Trust\u2019s River Project last plucked Big from the Hudson River. Big\u2019s shell is home to 41 ribbed mussels and more than four dozen barnacles. The drop in weight may be related to the death of a former shell resident, another oyster.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Local residents and community groups in the upstate Finger Lakes region are demanding action from state officials after a cryptomining company has continued to operate a gas-fired power plant three years after being denied an air permit, according to\nGothamist\n. The company, Greenridge Generation, filed an appeal to the denial, allowing it to continue operating while the case made its way through the courts. Now that the case is back in front of a judge, local community members and groups say they will file a motion requesting evidentiary hearings to wrap up by year\u2019s end.\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani is leading in mayoral polls against opponent Andrew Cuomo by 19 percent, per a new poll,\nCity &amp; State\nreports. The same poll showed that Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s lead against potential Republican opponent Rep. Elise Stefanik has shrunk 6 percentage points since June. Hochul is now ahead by 14 percentage points.\n\u2014 Local politicians are bracing for federal overreach in NYC after Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and put the city\u2019s police under federal control, according to\nThe City\n. \u201cWith Donald Trump, you can get any level of reaction on any given day, and he believes that he has some special privilege to interfere and meddle with the functions of New York City,\u201d Council member Keith Powers told the outlet. \u201cHe did it on congestion pricing and transportation, and certainly he\u2019ll do it again in the future when it comes to deploying the National Guard.\u201d\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$17.6 million\nfor a new-construction unit at 217 West 57th Street.

        "content": "One reader who has been following the\nsaga\nof model Aubrey Hill\u2019s subletter in\nThe Real Deal\nis the judge in his eviction case, Adam R. Meyers.\nThe judge observed that subletter Tasheem Jenkins was \u201cless focused and animated\u201d at his July 14 court appearance than at previous hearings, perhaps because \u201cof being the object of a media campaign seemingly designed to cause him embarrassment.\u201d\nTRD\u2019s \u201cmedia campaign\u201d aimed not to humiliate Jenkins but to depict how hard it can be for landlords to regain control of an apartment, even from someone with no authorization to live there, no resources, and a self-reported history of incarceration and substance abuse.\nThe articles showed Jenkins to be savvy enough to have lived rent-free in Apartment D of 367 Wadsworth Avenue since late 2023, despite the best efforts of the landlord\u2019s legal team to oust him.\nJenkins accomplished this with no lawyer, no legal training and no lease \u2014 just his own instincts and a set of keys from Hill, a fashion model and longtime family friend who left the country early last year after ignoring a signed agreement to repay her rent arrears.\nHill\u2019s subletter was by no means a savant. When evaluated by a medical professional sent by the Adams administration, Jenkins was unable to calculate how many quarters are in $2.75, even with assistance, and struggled to name the president of the United States, although he correctly guessed \u201cTrump.\u201d\nBut Jenkins was smart enough to hold onto Apartment D when Hill, the first high-fashion model from West Virginia, received an eviction notice and moved to Europe.\nMany rulings in the eviction case went against him, primarily because he showed no capacity to pay the tens of thousands of dollars in arrears, let alone the $1,675 rent going forward. Yet he cogently defended his rights in court and adroitly pivoted to new legal strategies every time eviction seemed imminent.\n\nJenkins showed the court his sublet agreement with Hill, who had hidden it from her landlord. He sought a\none-shot deal\nfrom the city to pay Hill\u2019s arrears, but could not get one without a lease. He applied for a\nCityFHEPS rental voucher\n. He claimed succession rights, saying he had lived with Hill for four years, but was denied. He had knee surgery and got a case number from Adult Protective Services, which later dropped him. He appealed court rulings. Each effort bought him more time.\nA default judgment was issued as far back as February 2024. At least once, a city marshal was days away from removing him from Apartment D.\nHis latest \u2014 and possibly final \u2014 potential savior was the Adams administration\u2019s Department of Social Services, which sought to have a guardian appointed to help Jenkins fight eviction. DSS wanted the owner of 367 Wadsworth Avenue, rather than a city-funded homeless shelter, to house him.\nIt was DSS that arranged for the medical evaluation, which took place in the contested apartment.\nBut now, Jenkins might have no cards left to play. Judge Meyers, a former advocate for tenants, declined last month to appoint a guardian, noting that Jenkins had been \u201ca capable and creative self-advocate\u201d and had quit drugs and alcohol last year.\nWith a flourish of legalese, the judge essentially paraphrased economist Herb Stein\u2019s famous saying, \u201cIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\u201d\n\u201cPetitioner was awarded judgment of possession against Jenkins almost a year ago, and its ability to realize this relief cannot be delayed indefinitely,\u201d the judge wrote.\nHe paused the eviction through Aug. 29, giving Jenkins time \u201cto vacate the premises with dignity.\u201d\n",

It was most recently reduced to just under $20 million in May.\nCompass\u2019 Josh Flagg and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Josh Altman represented the Dubrows. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Christina Pope and Forward Luxury Estates\u2019 Gary Reavis represented the buyer, who sources say is from overseas.\nThe Dubrows bought the property in 2023 for a reported $16 million from a trust tied to the late filmmaker Martha De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis had lived in the home with her late husband and film producer Dino De Laurentiis.\n\nThe nearly 9,000-square-foot mansion has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, perched high above Beverly Hills. Designed in the French Normandy-style, the home sits on an over 6-acre lot with a tennis court, multiple outdoor dining and entertainment areas, pool, spa and terrace, according to the listing.\nWhile luxury real estate is trading within the county, several high-profile closings have missed the mark when it comes to getting close to the original ask.\nActor\nJim Carrey\nhad been trying to sell his Brentwood home since 2023 and finally closed on a buyer for it last week.

        "content": "Chicago investor Chikoo Patel and his partner Shai Wolkowicki are sinking deeper into multifamily distress for deals across Illinois, public records show.\nAfter Patel took heat from tenants this spring for allegedly deplorable conditions in South Shore apartment units managed by his Chicago-based firm CKO Real Estate, investors and lenders are pursuing him and Wolkowicki for nearly $20 million total in various court cases.\nThe claims range from failing to pay off large mortgages, to bilking investment partners out of more than $1 million through a Southwest Side townhomes deal, court records show. The allegations show that even as\nPatel and Wolkowicki were working to gain an interest\nin more distressed Chicago multifamily properties at attractive prices, they were also losing their grip due to a series of mistakes on investments they already owned.\nAn attorney for Patel declined to comment, and Wolkowicki \u2014 who recently split amicably from his previous firm GW Properties that involved a partnership with developer Mitch Goltz \u2014 didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nBrothers Nishant and Vishal Tulsian are putting Patel\u2019s property management practices under the microscope in the Southwest Side case, which stems from financial trouble the trio encountered after purchasing a 24-unit townhouse property in 2020 for $1.8 million. The property is mostly rented to federally subsidized tenants at 4500 West 45th Street just north of Midway International Airport.\nThe siblings claim in a lawsuit filed in Texas court last month that Patel \u201cfraudulently induced them to invest in the W. 45th St. venture; embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from W. 45th St. LLC, including by paying himself hundreds of thousands of dollars in unauthorized or excessive reimbursements in breach of their Operating Agreement; willfully neglected the W. 45th St. property and the W. 45th St. LLC business, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages including lost revenue and fees for years of unpaid utility bills; covered up his neglect and embezzlement with numerous lies; and exposed W. 45th St. LLC to significant potential liability to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u201d\nTheir lawsuit shows HUD removed Patel\u2019s firm as manager of the property in June and replaced it with Gilead Management. The suit also claims Patel never paid his $175,000 capital contribution to the LLC to stake his claim in the property, while the brothers, who lacked low-income housing investment experience, put up all the money to buy the property and relied on Patel\u2019s expertise.\n\nSo far, the biggest debt Patel and Wolkowicki are late paying is owed to Old National Bank, which claims they\u2019re late paying off nearly $16 million for a mortgage on a 220-unit property in Springfield, the Illinois capital downstate from their homebase in Chicago. The property, known as Pine Ridge Apartments, at 1833 Seven Pines Road, was purchased by Patel and Wolkowicki for a little more than $16 million, or $73,000 per unit, in 2023. But Old National last month began pursuing foreclosure and collection of a guarantee that Wolkowicki and Patel signed to secure the loan.\nThe Old National loan wasn\u2019t scheduled to mature until 2026, but the borrowers defaulted on making monthly payments starting in April, the suit said.\nFurthermore, a company called Cucumber Capital claims Patel\u2019s CKO was set to borrow more than $110,000 by pledging future business revenues as repayment, including from the Springfield property, but defaulted on the agreement, according to a lawsuit filed in Connecticut.\nLegal trouble is ramping up for Patel and Wolkowicki about a year after they were helping Milwaukee-based landlord F Street Investments raise cash to buy $35 million worth of South Side multifamily properties that were in various stages of financial distress. However, public records show that buildings within the portfolios they were targeting haven\u2019t yet changed hands. Meanwhile, a lender has initiated foreclosure actions for a handful of them that are owned by Chicago-based Catalyst Realty. F Street executives didn\u2019t answer questions about the status of the transactions they had planned and instead referred inquiries to Wolkowicki.\nChicago-based lender\nRenovo Financial\nearlier this month also sued Patel for allegedly failing to fulfill a guarantee tied to the 13-unit apartment building at 7655 South Coles Avenue in Chicago.\nPatel still owes Renovo nearly $54,000 in connection with a loan he took out on the building in partnership with Wolkowicki\u2019s firm Salina Investment Partners, the suit claims. Patel and Wolkwocki\u2019s ventures borrowed $833,000 from Renovo for the property in 2023, but the lender is still seeking payment from Patel even after Wolkowicki appears to have recapitalized the property earlier this year through Salina and an investment partner by getting a new, larger loan from Pan American Bank &amp; Trust.\nPatel has yet to respond in court to the allegations in court. He settled a lawsuit earlier this summer over a nearly $100,000 claim that Broad Shoulders Flats LLC made against him for allegedly mismanaging funds derived from CKO\u2019s operation of a 12-unit building at 1513-17 West Diversey Parkway in Chicago that the LLC owns.\n",

However, fitness centers and entertainment retail have been quick to fill space in Texas, contributing significantly to the state\u2019s low vacancy rates.\nThe vacancy rate halfway through the year was lower than the 20-year historic average in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Partners Real Estate. Houston had the highest vacancy at 5.5 percent.\nIn DFW, where the retail vacancy rate is 4.8 percent, compared to a historic average of 6.4 percent, Crunch Fitness, EoS Fitness and the Picklr had leased 115,000 square feet halfway through this year. Crunch has also leased almost 44,000 square feet in Austin and over 54,000 square feet in San Antonio.\n\nOther fitness and play concepts include pickleball club Dill Dinkers, which leased 24,000 square feet in San Antonio; NRG Trampoline, which leased almost 47,000 square feet in San Antonio; Jumping World, which leased over 31,000 square feet in Houston; and Sky Zone, which leased 40,000 in Houston.\nMeanwhile,\ngrocery-anchored shopping centers\nare burgeoning to accommodate Texas\u2019 population growth, dominating retail development.\nGrocery store closures in Texas reflect local competition as much as national pressure, said Steve Triolet, senior vice president of research at Partners.

        "content": "A developer planned to complete a 141-unit apartment building in Miami\u2019s Wynwood Norte neighborhood last year.\nThe project was first revealed in the fall of 2022. Yet, instead of starting construction, Evolve Companies listed the six-lot assemblage for sale this spring, asking $14 million.\nAcross South Florida, developers who planned\nmultifamily\nbuildings in recent years are now quietly putting the sites up for sale, according to online listings and experts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that the market cycle for new construction multifamily is ending,\u201d said broker Tony Arellano. \u201cInterest rates are higher, development costs are higher, concessions [to apartment tenants] are higher.\u201d\nThe uptick in listings comes as the tri-county region\u2019s market turned. Multifamily boomed in the three years after the pandemic started, fueled by an influx of out-of-staters that created\nunprecedented demand\nand\nrecord rent\ngrowth. Developers seized on the bonanza by quickly completing new projects. But in the past two years, inflation and elevated interest rates have made construction more expensive, and the development flurry created a\nsupply overhang\n, lowering rents. The Trump administration\u2019s tariff and\nimmigration policies\nthrew more uncertainty into the market.\nFor many developers, the risks are too high and returns too low to build apartments, experts said.\n\u201cAll the big developers and players tell us [that] if it wasn\u2019t shovels in the ground by a couple of months ago or last year, they are not going vertical,\u201d said broker Sebastian Faerman.\nBut, he cautioned, not everyone is selling multifamily sites because they are priced out of construction. Some are \u201cland guys,\u201d whose business model is to purchase, entitle and flip properties. Others are\nLive Local Act\ninvestors who are using the state law to supersize development entitlements and now want to flip the sites for a profit. The two-year-old state law allows for bigger projects as long as 40 percent of units in the new buildings are below-market rentals.\nIt isn\u2019t clear how many sellers marketing multifamily development sites are feeling the sting from higher construction costs and interest rates. Developers interviewed for this story cited various reasons for listing their properties, vehemently denying it\u2019s because of costs or expected lower returns.\n\u201cDevelopers can\u2019t tell you, \u2018We are hurting \u2026 we need to get a buyer.\u2019\u201d said broker Miguel Pinto.\n\u201cSome of these guys bought at the top of the market. They were overleveraged, and they thought everything was going to keep being peachy, that the rents would be peachy, that with Trump being in power, interest rates would have dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of that has happened.\u201d\nThe pain is widespread, and a crop of developers are in a bind, said Pinto, of Apex Capital Realty. They own land that is not producing income and is costing them in property tax bills, and is financed with loans with looming maturities, he added.\nEven those not listing their sites on the market, will consider an offer. \u201cIf it\u2019s not publicly for sale, it\u2019s still for sale,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cEveryone is a net seller right now. All it takes is one call to their office.\u201d\nToo much in Wynwood\nClara Homes\u2019 147-unit planned apartment tower in\nWynwood\nisn\u2019t going exactly as intended.\nFor more than a year, the Miami-based firm worked on the\nproposal\n, paying $7.7 million for the nearly half-acre site, scoring approval from a city design review board and publicizing the 22-story Clara Wynwood project.\nLast month, Clara Homes listed the site for $10.9 million.\n\u201cPre-Covid, there were two vertical buildings in Wynwood. Post-Covid, there were 36,\u201d Arellano, who is marketing the site, said. \u201cSo we have provided a tremendous supply of market-rate rentals.\u201d\nA record 18,600 apartments were completed last year in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, CoStar Group data shows. That followed 15,300 units completed in 2023; 11,200 in 2022, and 10,700 in 2021.\nThe hefty completions were mostly of high-end market-rate rentals in urban cores, including Wynwood, according to CoStar\u2019s Juan Arias, director of market analytics for South Florida.\nAs a result, rents are no longer rising. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Wynwood is $3,049 this month, down 2 percent from last month, and down 7 percent from last year, according to\nZumper\n. A two-bedroom is $4,500, flat compared to last month, and a 2 percent drop from last year. A three-bedroom is $5,722, down 1 percent from last month, and flat, year-over-year, Zumper data shows.\nJames Curnin, founder of Clara Homes, conceded Wynwood has high inventory. But he said that\u2019s not why he listed the Clara Wynwood site. If the firm builds the project, the supply will be absorbed by the time the tower is completed, he said.\n\u201cI just want to move to bigger and better things,\u201d said Curnin, who also cited issues with a protracted site plan approval process.\nEvolve Companies, based in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina, paid roughly $18.8 million in two deals for a pair of multifamily development sites in Miami\u2019s\nWynwood Norte\narea in 2022, marking the firm\u2019s South Florida debut. It hired architect Kobi Karp and submitted proposals for a pair of buildings along Northwest Fifth Avenue. In March, Evolve scored approval for the first\neight-story, 141-unit building\n.\nA month later, Evolve listed the roughly 1-acre site on the market for $14 million, as well as the 0.7-acre property for its second project, a planned\n11-story building with 105 units\n, for $12 million.\nEvolve\u2019s forte is garden-style apartment complexes in states elsewhere in the Southeast, brokers marketing the site said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really have boots on the ground in Miami, and they are more based in North Carolina. We have solidified for them a great [joint venture] partner\u201d for the 141-unit project, said George Belesis, of Dwntwn, who is marketing the sites.\nThe firm may pursue the 105-unit project or may turn it into a Live Local Act project, added Dwntwn\u2019s Wilson Alers, who is also marketing the properties.\nEvolve, led by Mike Winstead Jr. and Joe McKinney, didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nCurnin\u2019s Clara Wynwood site also could secure a partner through marketing, or he may lease the one-story, 11,400-square-foot building. The Austin Burke menswear retailer that had occupied the property for decades closed this year.\nDwntwn\u2019s Devlin Marinoff, who also is marketing Curnin\u2019s site, noted that the market is currently in a multifamily absorption cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s the ordinary lifecycle of real estate,\u201d he said.\nOut with the \u201cless tested\u201d\nDuring the multifamily boom, developers homed in on\nsouth Miami-Dade County\n, an area with an ample supply of discounted buildable land. They filed a flurry of project proposals.\nNow, many of their sites have popped up for sale.\nDevelopers with projects in urban cores who expanded to south Miami-Dade are getting stretched too thin with pending plans and are more likely to let go of their south county sites, said Faerman, of FA Commercial.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s in [Miami\u2019s] Edgewater or Wynwood, they are still going to go vertical,\u201d he said. But in \u201cless tested\u201d south Miami-Dade, \u201cthere\u2019s less [comparables] to look at to see what is actually achievable\u201d for rents.\nK2 Capital Group, led by Mariano Karner and Esteban Koffsmon, paid $4 million last year for a 2.6-acre site in\nGoulds\n. The firm proposed an\neight-story, 206-unit apartment project\nin May. The land, which allows up to 12 stories and 320 units, is now on the market, with an asking price of about $6.3 million, according to Faerman, the listing broker.\n\u201cIf someone wants to pay a premium, I would consider selling,\u201d Koffsmon said, adding the listing is more of a market \u201ctest\u201d and a potential path to finding a partner for K2 Capital\u2019s growing development pipeline.\nElsewhere in Miami-Dade, some multifamily developers have dealt with higher costs and less demand by\nswitching their apartment projects to condos\n.\nThe problem? Not every multifamily site works for condos, Pinto said. Those who couldn\u2019t do a condo conversion are now looking for an equity infusion to help start their projects, and finding slim pickings.\n\u201cWhen you have rates so high, you can put risk-free money in bonds or the money market at 5 [percent] or 6 percent. So why would you take a risk with a developer,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cOne thing is you buying the property with investors, another is getting money from investors to start building right now. For multifamily, it\u2019s very, very hard.\u201d\nTide coming in?\nThe uptick in listings of development sites is a sign the market\u2019s picking up \u2014 not that it\u2019s slowing, said broker Chris Lentz.\nEconomic tailwinds are in store: Banks are reentering capital markets, loan spreads are narrowing and construction costs are decreasing, he said. The fear of tariffs has been abated because the \u201cimpact to costs was not as significant as anticipated,\u201d and interest rates fell slightly, with bigger cuts expected, Lentz added. He cited Chicago-based financial services firm CME Group\u2019s prediction of a 94 percent probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting next month.\n\u201cIf anything, we are actually starting to see higher transaction velocity, and that may be why people may want to test the market again,\u201d said Lentz of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThis month, Swire Properties sold a nearly 1-acre development site proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys to Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International for\n$45 million\n.\n\u201cWe are seeing renewed activity with more capitalizations of developments and more acquisitions of sites,\u201d Lentz said.\nSites like Swire\u2019s are exceptions, Pinto countered. It\u2019s \u201cthe guys that bought B and C sites\u201d that are trying to sell now, he said.\nHe also expects an interest rate reprieve, which could come when Jerome Powell\u2019s term as the Fed\u2019s chair ends next spring. Until then, it won\u2019t be easy for overleveraged developers that are priced out of construction.\n\u201cThey bought [land], thought they would build it, [and] the world turned on them,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cThings will shake out, and that\u2019s when we will know who had a backup plan and the financial wherewithal.\u2026 As the old saying goes, \u2018When the tide goes out, we see who is swimming naked.\u2019\u201d\n",

        "content": "The 21-story Wedbush Center in Downtown Los Angeles was recently appraised at $60.5 million compared with a $197.5 million value at loan issuance, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThat\u2019s a 69 percent decline in around seven years.\nThe Class A building\u2013which faces the stretch of the 110 Freeway that cuts through the city\u2019s center\u2013is worth less than half the $128 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt balance connected to the Cerberus Capital Management-owned building. The private equity firm\npurchased\nthe 475,000-square-foot office building at 1000 Wilshire Boulevard for $196 million from Lincoln Property Company in 2018.\nCerberus Capital Management did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe debt\nlanded\nin special servicing after Cerberus Capital Management missed its March maturity amid plummeting occupancy, an issue for a lot of Downtown office towers. Occupancy at the Wedbush Center dropped to 67 percent at the end of last year compared to 87 percent at loan underwriting.\n\nA special servicer is reviewing resolution alternatives, according to Morningstar. But things could soon get worse as the building\u2019s name tenant, its largest, plans to vacate once its lease expires at the end of the year. Wedbush Securities is\nditching\n100,000 square feet Downtown for a smaller space in Pasadena, ending a more than 20-year residency at the building under multiple owners.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, a very big decision for the firm,\u201d chief executive and president Gary Wedbush said then. \u201cThe pandemic and COVID created a different kind of office for us. There are places like Pasadena that seem to have recovered more fully from the pandemic than Downtown Los Angeles has. That was a part of the decision-making.\u201d\nDowntown Los Angeles currently has an office vacancy rate of nearly 33 percent. Tenants are fleeing to places such as\nCentury City\n, where they can entice workers back to their desks with offices that have ample amenities and where homelessness is less of a concern.\nPasadena, meanwhile, also has seen some distress in its office sector. A nine-story office tower in the San Gabriel Valley city saw its value\nslashed\nin half after a recent appraisal and a two-building complex recently\nsold\nat a deep discount.\n",

The deal works out to about $1,969 per square foot, aligning with values prevalent in Palo Alto and other high-demand office markets before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak five years ago.\nInspire Real Estate Holdings sold the property. The Florida-based company bought it from Hewlett-Packard in 2003 for an undisclosed price.\nThe four-story building spans approximately 38,000 square feet, according to the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\n. The property is near Stanford University and the Palo Alto\nCaltrain\nstation. Ground-floor retail tenants including Salt &amp; Straw, Nola, Citibank and the Shade Store.\nOther office buildings in downtown Palo Alto that fetched similar prices per square foot before the pandemic include 192 Lytton Avenue for $23.1 million, or $2,551 a square foot; 530 Lytton Avenue for $117.5 million, or $2,156 a square foot; 150 Forest Avenue for $26 million, or $2,153 a square foot; and 385 Sherman Avenue for $138 million, or $2,030 a square foot.\n\nElsewhere in Palo Alto, office property sales have run the gamut from bargain-basement prices to nearly reaching pre-pandemic values, amid the market\u2019s rocky recovery.\nLast year, Hudson Pacific Properties sold a 182,700-square-foot office campus at\n4001-4009 Miranda Avenue\nto an undisclosed buyer for $23 million, or about $126 per square foot. In 2023, Greenbrae-based Douglas Living Trust bought a 30,000-square-foot office building at\n2555 Park Boulevard\nin south Palo Alto from Kenson Ventures for $58 million, or about $2,000 per square foot.\nIn 2023, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust bought $167 billion in assets and $119 billion in deposits from the failed institution. It\u2019s now a division of First Citizens BancShares, which also owns First Citizens Bank.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Five of the condominium\u2019s 16 units are still on the market, including another penthouse asking just under $3 million.\nSerhant\u2019s Raquel Lomonico represented the sponsor in the deal, according to the deal sheet. Alison Glestein, a member of Lomonico\u2019s five-person team, brought the buyer.\nLomonico said she stepped away from the project after finding a buyer for the penthouse and six other condos at the building. Another team from Serhant and one at Compass are heading sales of the project\u2019s remaining units.\n\nEast Williamsburg, like neighboring Williamsburg and Greenpoint, is historically known for its rental and townhouse stock rather than new development condos.\nBut the neighborhood has been buoyed by a slate of condo projects along the heavily trafficked L subway line. Before 392 Graham Avenue and the Umbrella Factory at 710 Metropolitan Avenue notched record-setting deals, a condo at the Milk Factory at 850 Metropolitan Avenue pushed\npricing to new heights\nwhen it sold for $1,667 a foot.\nDeal prices in East Williamsburg have been on the rise, with the median sale price hitting just under $1.5 million in June, up 19 percent year-over-year, according to data from Redfin.\nStill, the neighborhood is less expensive than Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where waterfront new development condos such as Miki Naftali\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf and Quadrum Global\u2019s the Huron have redefined their condo markets. In Williamsburg, Two Trees Management\u2019s One Domino Square scored the\nmost expensive deal\non a price per square foot basis when a penthouse traded for more than $3,000 a foot.\n",

        "content": "As downtown Los Angeles continues a lengthy post-pandemic office market recovery, the plummeting of values so far could prove beneficial in addressing another looming issue: The\ncity\u2019s housing crisis\n.\nCase in point: The redevelopment of the L.A. Care tower downtown into high-end housing,\nThe Los Angeles Times\nreported.\nDeveloper Garrett Lee of\nJamison Properties\nis preparing to begin the transformation of the nearly 610,000-square-foot building at 1055 West 7th Street into 691 luxury residences, a plan,\nfirst floated in 2023\n. Current tenants include the Central Civil West courthouse of Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\nAs it stands, Downtown L.A. has 54 office buildings that are at immediate risk of losing value, with a potential $70 billion possibly disappearing over the next 10 years, according to a new\nreport\nfrom BAE Urban Economics and cited by the Times. That worst-case scenario would create a loss of $353 million in property tax receipts and other related revenue streams for the public sector.\n\u201cDeclining assessed values are likely to translate into significant losses in General Fund revenue\u201d for the city, the report said. Housing conversions such as the L.A. Care tower project might be a silver bullet to increase buildings\u2019 values and occupancy rates, according to the report.\n\nIf developers converted 10 large office buildings into housing, it would boost their combined assessed property value by $12 billion over a decade, the report said. That would add $46 million in tax revenue and more than 3,800 residential units to the housing supply.\nApartment occupancy in Downtown L.A. has been slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels at\nabout 90 percent\n. The city center has also seen a spike in housing construction in recent years, with 22 percent of new housing built in the city over the past decade rising in downtown, according to the Times.\nTurning unused offices into housing is on city officials\u2019 list of priorities, Rachel Freeman, the city\u2019s deputy mayor of business and economic development, told the Times.\n\u201cWe have a deep need for more housing at all levels of affordability,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cAdaptive reuse has the potential to be a tool to help achieve our goals towards housing production and also the revitalization of our core urban centers.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Real estate firm Ponte Equities is cashing in on a piece of 70 Vestry Street.\nThe family-run firm sold unit 10W for $18.5 million to another owner in the building, in what one broker who has sold in the building called a \u201csuper off-market\u201d deal.\nThe sale is the first at 70 Vestry for Ponte, which sold the site that became the luxury condo to Related in 2014 for $115 million. As part of the deal, Ponte was allowed to buy\n15 of the 46 units that Related developed\nat the site for a steep discount.\nThe two firms have partnered on a number of projects in the area, where the Ponte family accumulated a small real estate empire of parking garages, warehouses and auto shops in the 1960s.\nPonte was given a sweet deal on the units, paying almost $37 million, or an average of $2.45 million per unit. The original offering plan priced the units at over $142 million combined, or roughly $9.5 million per unit.\nUnit 10W was priced at $12.5 million on the original offering plan. The unit has not been publicly listed, but spans 2,600 square feet and has three bedrooms and three full bathrooms, according to the offering plan.\nA member of the family declined to comment on the sale of the unit.\nThe anonymous buyer already owns the northern unit on the 10th floor, which they bought for $27 million in 2018. The buyer plans to combine the units, according to a source familiar with the deal.\n\nAn attorney for the buyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nPonte has been renting out a number of the units, according to StreetEasy.\nIn January, Unit 7B rented for $62,000 per month. Last fall, Unit 6F rented for $38,000 and Unit 6E rented for $48,000 per month.\nArran Patel, Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara of Compass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team have been the listing agents for the rental units.\nAlthough it\u2019s difficult to peg a price change to the unit given the original bulk sale, other resales in the highly sought-after building have generally snagged premiums.\nOn average, units in the building have sold for 22 percent more than their original sale price, according to an analysis by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group provided to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThis year, a fifth-floor unit closed for $8.6 million, 25 percent above its original sale price, and a fourth-floor unit closed for $9.6, 16 percent above its original sale price.\n",

A sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nit changed hands for $70 million, or $108 per square foot.\nThe ground lease with Sol Goldman Investments still has 60 years left on it. The balance on the leasehold\u2019s loan, last known to be\nrefinanced in 2019\n, is $182 million.\nCBRE\u2019s Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon negotiated the leasehold interest sale.\nA source close to the transaction noted that RXR viewed the asset in the \u201cfilm\u201d category, not up to the standard of the \u201cdigital\u201d assets the company prizes.\nRepresentatives for both Lincoln Property and Cross Ocean referenced the importance of the asset\u2019s strong cash flow in teaming up for the first time to acquire the 650,000-square-foot property, according to\nGlobe St\n.\n\nRXR\nacquired the building\nin 2014 for slightly under $195 million, its first purchase in Downtown Brooklyn, and one of the largest office deals in borough history. The firm quickly got going on a $74 million renovation and upgrade to the property, which was converted to an office in 2012 after about a decade as a data center.\nThe building is fully leased, largely to the New York City Human Resources Administration and the New York City Housing Authority. There\u2019s 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor; wholesale retailer Boxed signed a lease for 15,000 square feet in 2022 at an asking rent of $50 per square foot, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nThe leasehold interest sale marks just the fourth office investment for Cross Ocean, which has approximately $10 billion in assets under management. It is, however, the asset manager\u2019s sixth investment in the New York metro area in the last year.\nLincoln Property has also made a half-dozen investments in the area in the last year or so.

The sellers listed the home last spring for slightly under $6 million.\nDubbed \u201cWestland,\u201d the property last traded hands a decade ago for $4.3 million. The seller could not be reached for comment by the outlet, while the buyer\u2019s information was not disclosed.\nThe sale of the 6,400-square-foot home breaks down to $828 per square foot. The property includes six bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\nThe home was built before the Civil War for Sen. Robert F. Stockton, a naval commodore who was a descendant of a Declaration of Independence signee. The property spans one-and-a-half acres; the Colonial-style home had its facade restored two decades ago to resemble the property\u2019s Cleveland era. Features include 12-foot ceilings and oversized windows.\n\nCleveland shacked up at the Princeton abode at the conclusion of his second presidential term, living there for the last decade of his life. The property is a National Historic Landmark and has a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.\nMaura Mills of Callaway Henderson Sotheby\u2019s International \u2013 Princeton had the\nlisting\n. Queenston Realty\u2019s Carina Krall procured the buyer, who was \u201cattracted to the home\u2019s majestic appearance and feel, its history, its location in a diverse and exciting community, its condition, and its warmth for everyday living,\u201d according to Mills.\nIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for a presidential home to remain a private residence long-term, as they are often repurposed for civic use. Incidentally, another president\u2019s former home in Princeton, a Tudor Revival built for Woodrow Wilson, is being marketed for $6.5 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Gambino declined to comment.\nRecords through Propertyshark show the home last traded in 2006 from singer-songwriter Ricky Martin to Michael S. Smith and his wife Iris Smith. Ownership has since been shuttled from trusts to most recently a shell company called 1309 Davies LLC, which has a Broomfield, Colo. address tied to Blue Spruce Capital Corp.\nPrevious ownership of the home tells quite the history. Among the list of those who once called the property home are Martin and Oscar winner Michael Caine, whose credits include \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d among other titles. The family of actress and singer Doris Day also at one time owned the property.\nWhomever moves in will be rubbing shoulders with equally as high profile a group in the area\u2019s neighbors.\nAbout a 10-minute walk away is the\nPritzker Estate\nat\n1261 Angelo Drive\n. The home is currently listed for $175 million but asked as much as $195 million in October. It\u2019s being sold by Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker and his ex-wife and philanthropist Jeanne Pritzker.\n\nLess than three miles away in Bel-Air is 875 Nimes Road, which is known as Chartwell Estate. The mansion, which was used in the opening credits of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d TV show, was purchased by News Corp chair and Fox Corp. CEO\nLachlan Murdoch\n, who paid $150 million for it in 2019. It was the priciest deal in the state\u2019s history at the time.\nThe Davies Drive home spans a little over 9,200 square feet and has six beds and 12 baths.\nThe gated estate\u2019s motor court has room for more than 20 cars, with the over two-acre lot holding a main residence, guest house, tennis court, children\u2019s playground, security house, orchard, herb and rose gardens.\nAmong the main home\u2019s highlights are a theater with a snack room, along with a primary suite that touts its own terrace and massage room.\n",

Eichner revised the plan to include a building height of only 14 stories, but the commission once again rejected it.\n\nSpice Factory owner Zev Golombeck, who had initially agreed to sell to Eichner\u2019s Continuum Companies and Lincoln Equities if they scored the rezoning approval, filed his own plans to build a six-story, 239-unit project in 2022, but instead\nsold the site\nto Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler for $43 million.\nSchwartz\u2019s YS Developers then purchased the site from Hager and Hagler last May for\n$64 million\n, backed by a $42 million loan from G4 Capital Partners. The investment firm also provided $75 million in construction financing.\nUnder Eichner\u2019s initial plans, the development would have added a significant number of union-built, affordable rental apartments, in addition to the market-rate units, to the neighborhood. Instead, under Schwartz\u2019s plans, the project will yield market-rate condos asking more than $1,200 per square foot.\nLast November, Eichner\nreached an agreement\nwith City Council member Crystal Hudson to move forward with a project at the neighboring 962-964 Franklin Avenue. Plans for the site include 355 apartments, 106 of which will be income-restricted.\n",

At the top of the list is Los Angeles County with 846 tracts eligible for Opportunity Zone 2.0 tax incentives, while Orange County has 138.\nThe Bay Area is also rife with Opportunity Zone tracts. This includes 105 in Alameda County, 88 in Santa Clara County, 84 in San Francisco County, 71 in Contra Costa County, 34 in San Mateo County, 22 in Solano County, 13 in Sonoma County, and 12 in Marin County.\nThe previous version of the Opportunity Zone program exceeded expectations when it came to apartment openings and units under construction in designated opportunity zones.\n\nAbout 68,000 more units have opened in the Opportunity Zones than the pace that developers were completing before the tax break went into effect, according to\nCoStar\n. The estimated value of those units is estimated to be more than $18 billion.\nNationwide, apartments in Opportunity Zones make up a larger percentage of all the new units that open each year. In 2017, unit openings in Opportunity Zones accounted for 12 percent of all U.S. units, according to CoStar data. The following year \u2014 the first that the tax breaks became available \u2014 it increased to 14 percent in 2018. It climbed to 15 percent in both 2019 and 2020 and rose to 18 percent in 2021. Today, 23 percent of apartments now under construction will open in Opportunity Zones, according to CoStar.\nZones in the city of Los Angeles benefitted the most. Before the tax breaks, Opportunity Zones in L.A. had 1,245 new units, per CoStar. Last year, developers opened 3,432 apartments in these zones, while another 7,441 units are under construction.\nThe Opportunity Zone 2.0 program will officially open for investment on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Haussmann Development is moving ahead with plans for a major residential project in Jamaica, Queens, taking over a stalled KD Sagamore Capital site and upping the unit count.\nJosef Goodman\u2019s firm, through a limited liability company, filed plans with the city Department of Buildings for a 14-story, 207,000-square-foot building at 159-31 90th Avenue, PincusCo\nreported\n. The GF55 Partners-designed project will hold between 205 and 259 apartments \u2014 the precise number varies across project filings \u2014 along with a church sanctuary seating 400, offices for the First Reformed Dutch Church of Jamaica and an on-site apartment for its pastor.\nThe site has a complicated recent history. In 2019, KD Sagamore signed a 99-year ground lease with the church valued at $8.8 million, following court approval. KD Sagamore then filed plans for a 136-unit building, but never broke ground.\nWhile a lease transfer hasn\u2019t been publicly recorded, Haussmann states in its filing that it controls the property through its LLC. The firm similarly took over KD Sagamore\u2019s Arris Grand development in Clinton Hill a few months back; in March, Haussmann scored a $49.5 million loan to refinance the nine-story, mixed-use complex with 113 apartments, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe latest filing for the 90th Avenue project calls for apartments on floors two through 14, as well as amenities like a lounge, recreation room and outdoor space on the second floor. The cellar will hold church meeting rooms, management offices, bike storage for 108 bicycles and building systems. No retail is planned for the 24,000-square-foot parcel.\n\nOn its\nwebsite\n, the developer refers to the project as \u201cThe Tabernacle.\u201d Though the address differs slightly from project filings, the development is billed as a 205-unit, 11-story, all-affordable housing project that will also include social services for residents.\nHaussmann did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nJamaica has been a prime Queens neighborhood for development, ranking fourth in the borough for major projects. In the past two years, it logged 1.9 million square feet of commercial and multifamily construction.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property now consists of three vacant lots, as well as a pair of two-story apartment buildings with 16 units, combined, completed in 1945 and 1954.\nShani Heskiel of Beachfront Realty represented the seller, and Bobby Berrido of Fausto Commercial represented the buyer.\nConstruction of The Aurelian is expected to start early next year, the release says.\n\nEmpira\n\u2013\u2013 led by Rafael Aregger, Branko Kuzmanovi\u0107 and Michael Marrero \u2013\u2013 has largely focused on private equity and debt investment in residential real estate in German-speaking parts of Europe. It invests on behalf of German pension funds, insurance firms and banks.\nIt\u2019s been ramping up its Miami-Dade development pipeline since first entering the market in 2022 with the\n$9 million\npurchase of a half-acre development site in The Roads neighborhood of Miami. Empira is developing the eight-story, 85-unit Enso multifamily project on the site at 3025 and 3051 Southwest Third Avenue.\nLast year, Empira, which is based in Zug, Switzerland, opened its\nU.S. headquarters\nin downtown Miami.\nIn May, Empira scored a\n$111.3 million\nconstruction loan for the 26-story, 310-unit Perrin apartment tower at 244 Southwest Ninth Street in Miami\u2019s Brickell. The firm had paid\n$21.5 million\nfor the 1-acre development site in 2023.\nRecords show construction of the Perrin started in June.\nA few residential projects are on tap in\nCoral Gables\n.\nShoma Group, led by married couple Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee, plans the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\napartment building, marking the first Live Local Act project in the city. The state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows bigger projects than a site\u2019s zoning permits as long as developers designate at least 40 percent of the units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nIn June, Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group paid\n$37.5 million\nfor the 4.8-acre Coral Gables redevelopment site at 6100 Caballero Boulevard. Fortune plans a $150 million branded condominium project with 251 units.\n",

It had been in the works for more than a decade before Ohtani signed on to an endorsement deal in 2023.\nHayes and Matsumoto claim they were pushed out of the deal after Ohtani and Balelo were brought in.\nBalelo allegedly sought assurances from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding their business partner, Las Vegas-based Kingsbarn Realty Capital, remove Hayes and Matsumoto from the deal. The suit claims that Ohtani and Balelo interfered with the contractual rights of Hayes and Matsumoto while they were planning and developing the real estate project.\n\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the suit says, according to USA Today. \u201c[Ohtani and Balelo] used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip [Hayes and Matsumoto] of the very project they conceived and built. [Ohtani and Balelo] must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity.\u201d\nIn response, Kingsbarn Realty called the allegations against Ohtani and Balelo \u201ccompletely frivolous and without merit\u201d in a statement.\n\u201cKingsbarn takes full responsibility for its actions regarding Kevin Hayes and for removing Tomoko Matsumoto as the project\u2019s broker,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe Mauna Kea project is world-class, and we look forward to welcoming our final group.\u201d\nLast year, Ohtani declared he would be the first resident on the property.

Harris County alone accounts for 526 of those \u2014 more than five times the number it received in the original Opportunity Zone rollout in 2017.\nTexas is projected to have nearly 2,500 eligible census tracts, second only to California, which has about 2,750. The populations of California and Texas last year were about\u00a0 39.5 million and 31.3 million, respectively.\nWith 526 eligible tracts, Harris County could host 21 percent of the state\u2019s zones, while the broader Houston region would make up over a quarter. Dallas County would have 297 eligible tracts; San Antonio\u2019s Bexar County would have 155; Fort Worth\u2019s Tarrant County would have 143; and Austin\u2019s Travis County would have 96, the outlet found.\nThe program allows investors to defer capital gains taxes if they park those profits in a fund that pours money into designated distress areas.\n\u201cOpportunity Zone 2.0,\u201d part of the Trump administration\u2019s federal tax and spending law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tightens eligibility by lowering income thresholds and eliminating the \u201ccontiguous tract\u201d provision.

Backers include Justin Timberlake, Tiger Woods, and billionaire\nJoe Lewis\u2019\nTavistock Group.\nBellissimo and his partners own a sprawling portfolio in Wellington, including the private Wanderers Club and Wellington International, the showgrounds that host the village\u2019s Winter Equestrian Festival.\nBellissimo\nwon a controversial approval\nfor the Wellington last year, which involved transferring 96 acres out of the village\u2019s 9,000-acre Equestrian Preserve as well as a threat to shutter the showgrounds. The Wellington is slated to include 253 homes, an 18-hole golf course and to be completed in 2028, according to the developer\u2019s website. Bellissimo will also expand and update Wellington International, as part of the agreement with the village.\nWLP still needs to receive final approval for the Marketplace. It will also contend with a similar mixed-use development from Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross, which reached an agreement in January to buy a 70-acre site known as K-Park from the village for $47 million, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported. It is planning a restaurant and retail district with a 180-key hotel and 500 residential units, akin to its West Palm Beach mixed-use development CityPlace.",

        "content": "Playboy will take its ongoing makeover from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, as the iconic, yet diminished brand is moving its headquarters to Robert Rivani\u2019s office building.\nPLBY Group, the\nLos Angeles\n-based publicly traded company that owns Playboy magazine, its website and its trademarks, is moving its 300-employee operation into a 20,000-square-foot penthouse office suite at the Rivani, a seven-story mixed-use building at 1691 Washington Avenue that is currently undergoing a $100 million renovation, a press release states.\nPlayboy signed a 10-year lease with a corporate guarantee, a spokesperson for\nRivani\nsaid.\u00a0 Tony Jones with Cushman Wakefield represented Playboy, and Jeremy Hakala with Newmark represented the landlord. The new star tenant is expected to move in next year when the renovations are completed, the spokesperson said.\nRivani, founder of Miami-based Black Lion, bought a ground lease as well as the building, formerly known as The Lincoln, for\n$62.5 million\nlast year. The land underneath is owned by the city of Miami Beach. Black Lion recently changed its name to Rivani, the release states.\n\nAs part of the move to\nMiami Beach\n, Playboy is also planning a content studio for its online creator network and a new members-only Playboy Club in Miami Beach \u201cwith a leading hospitality company,\u201d\u00a0 the release states. Playboy did not comment on the name of its members-only club partner. The facility would feature a restaurant and a members-only space inspired by the Playboy Mansion, the former Los Angeles home of the brand\u2019s late founder and longtime editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner, who died in 2017.\nSince before Hefner\u2019s death, Playboy has been in decline, a reflection of the overall decimation of the print magazine industry. PLBY Group ceased production of the monthly men\u2019s lifestyle magazine, while the company has struggled to keep up with online competition from other adult content companies and streaming platforms such as OnlyFans. In February, Playboy published an annual edition of the magazine.\nA majority of Playboy\u2019s revenue is derived from brand licensing. In the second quarter, PLBY Group reported $28.1 million in total revenue, largely due to a 105 percent increase in licensing revenue, an earnings report states.\nIn recent months, Rivani has sold portions of its restaurant portfolio. In May, the firm sold a space at the SLS Lux Brickell leased to Gekk\u00f5, a Japanese steakhouse owned by musician Bad Bunny and Miami Beach-based hospitality mogul David Grutman, and a space at Dua Miami Hotel leased to Mexican restaurant RosaNegra Miami. The combined sale price was\n$38.2 million\n.\nIn January, Rivani sold a commercial building in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood for\n$28.2 million\n. That property is leased to seafood restaurant Catch.",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s signing of two bills limiting the California Environmental Quality Act last month will make it easier for developers to build high-density housing in communities like Los Gatos, the Mercury New\nreported\n.\nAssembly Bill 130 exempts housing-rich infill developments smaller than 20 acres or builder\u2019s remedy projects under 5 acres from CEQA analysis, while Senate Bill 131 protects any rezoning required by a municipality\u2019s Housing Element from CEQA analysis.\nUnder Los Gatos\u2019 Housing Element, certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July of last year, the South Bay town must build about 2,000 new housing units by the beginning of 2032.\nThe town is\nprocessing\n11 builder\u2019s remedy applications, with projects like the Capri Fruitstand, the proposed housing redevelopment of an Ace Hardware location, and the Oswalt Building positioned to receive CEQA exemptions as a result of the new laws.\nThe Walnut Orchard project on the north end of town, for example, is a builder\u2019s remedy project that would be expedited under the new laws. The proposed development would create 138 townhomes including 28 affordable housing units.\n\n\u201cInstead of spending six months, it\u2019ll take me four months to create my application,\u201d Erik Hayden, manager of the real estate equity fund Urban Catalyst behind the project, told the outlet. Previously, it would\u2019ve taken six months for the city to process the application and then a year for the CEQA process, he said.\nThe legislation will also save developers money, as they have to foot the bill for CEQA analysis. Hayden said developers can fork over as much as $1 million for the process to create an environmental impact report.\nAbout 75 percent of Los Gatos has a low vulnerability to pollution sources like ozone, particulate matter, toxic release, hazardous waste, groundwater threats and solid waste sites, the outlet said. No neighborhoods in the town are ill-equipped to respond to disasters, and there\u2019s no anticipation that housing development would constrain the provision of public services like water, sewer and storm drains.\n\u201cLos Gatos almost uniformly had the lowest possible scores according to the CalEnviroScreen metric for 2021, meaning the town has more positive environmental factors,\u201d the\nHousing Element\nstated.\nThe town is\non the hook\nfor 1,993 new housing units by the end of 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The ruling included paying the judgement with interest as well as the attorney fees for Massa, a local dentist and owner of Massa Properties, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMassa accused Herrero of negligence and breach of contract over a 2022 office building deal in Lufkin that Herrero brokered for Massa. Attorneys said the transaction was handled in a \u201cdeceptive\u201d manner.\nA Bexar County judge found that Herrero failed to disclose that he also represented the seller in the deal and falsified a lease renewal document that compelled Massa to pay $3.34 million for the building.\nThe Texas Facilities Commission, a state agency that is responsible for managing and maintaining state facilities, holds the lease on the 10,000 square foot space in Lufkin.\n\nThis is the latest lawsuit against Herrero in his business dealings, and the second ruling this summer resulting in a default judgement for him to pay.\nVantage Bank won a $1 million judgement for an unpaid loan balance tied to a Grand Prairie office acquisition in June.\nThree CommonWealth Coffeehouse properties went up for auction at the beginning of the year as a result of a default on a $448,000 loan taken out through the First National Bank of Sonora in 2023. The properties are all in San Antonio: a shop at 118 Davis Court, a residence at 122 Davis Court, and a multifamily property called the Cottages on Grayson, at 930 East Grayson Street.\nThe CommonWealth Coffee ownership entity has additional loans totaling more than $1.75 million. The Texas Real Estate Commission\u2019s database shows no active or inactive broker or sales agent license under Herrero\u2019s name.\nThe auctions have not stopped the coffee shop\u2019s expansion in San Antonio. The company still operates a two story location at 203 East Jones Avenue just off Broadway in the former location of Rosella\u2019s, as well as locations in Alamo Heights, Hemisfair and\nWeston\n, and the company plans to open a location in Stone Oak this summer.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Taic\u2019s entity owns\nZ Ocean Hotel\n, which consists of the common areas, a ground-floor cafe, a parking deck and 22 units at the 88-key condo-hotel at 1437 Collins Avenue. The remaining units, of which 51 are managed by Sonesta Hotels, are owned by individuals and entities not affiliated with Taic, records show.\nFive days after Taic filed,\nWells Fargo\n, as trustee for a commercial mortgage-backed securities trust, filed a foreclosure complaint against Taic\u2019s entity, alleging it defaulted on a $12.2 million mortgage issued in 2019. Taic\u2019s entity allegedly failed to maintain adequate insurance coverage, failed to pay property taxes on time, failed to make monthly payments since April and other alleged breaches of the mortgage, the Wells Fargo complaint states. The bank is seeking a court-appointed receiver to take over management of Taic\u2019s entity.\nDavid Geller, the lawyer for Taic\u2019s entity, and Merrick Gross, the attorney for Wells Fargo, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn its complaint, Taic\u2019s entity accused Wells Fargo of violating federal law against deceptive and unfair trade practices by allegedly engaging in a predatory lending scheme designed to block Z Ocean Hotel\u2019s owner from being in compliance with the loan terms.\nWells Fargo did so with the \u201cultimate goal of foreclosing and taking [Z Ocean Hotel,]\u201d according to the complaint.\u00a0 Specifically, Wells Fargo played hardball when Taic\u2019s entity had trouble securing insurance for\nZ Ocean Hotel\n, the lawsuit alleges. The bank allegedly refused to provide a waiver when Taic\u2019s entity was unable to secure a new policy for the hotel due to \u201cextremely difficult and unreasonable market forces.\u201d\nWells Fargo allegedly obtained an insurance policy for Z Ocean Hotel, paying for it by withdrawing more than $800,000 from the Taic entity\u2019s mortgage escrow account, the lawsuit alleges. When Taic\u2019s entity sought proof of the insurance policy\u2019s cost, the loan servicer allegedly refused. Wells Fargo subsequently placed back $1 million into the escrow account in July with no explanation, Taic\u2019s entity alleges.\nMeanwhile, Taic\u2019s entity is fending off another foreclosure complaint. In July, Z-Hotel Holdings sued Taic\u2019s entity, alleging that it defaulted on a $4.9 million mortgage. That lender claims that it holds first position over the Wells Fargo loan, the Z-Hotel Holdings complaint states.\nIn 2020, after a seven-year legal fight, Taic won a $8.2 million judgment against the developers of Z Ocean Hotel who sold him their ownership interest in Z Ocean Hotel. Two years later, the sellers lost an appeal.\nTaic\nalleged that the developers \u2014 Gene Grabarnick, Pauline Grabarnick, Garett Grabarnick and Ronald Molko \u2013 misrepresented the financial viability of the condo-hotel project when he bought a majority interest in Z Ocean Hotel in 2008.",

        "content": "A family saga is one step closer to a finale. Mark Harounian notched a win in his legal battle with the sister who sued him a decade ago.\nMehrnaz Homapour claimed her brother duped her into signing agreements that let him enrich himself off family real estate companies. But a state judge Monday said she failed to demonstrate fraud, deciding several claims in her brother\u2019s favor.\nThe case, which is headed to trial, provides a look into how disputes arise in families where money is plentiful and agreements are informal.\nMark Harounian is the son of Jacob Harounian, the Iranian investor who made money in the Persian rug business before turning to Manhattan real estate. Mark\u2019s sisters are minority members in family LLCs that Mark manages.\nHomapour claimed her brother took funds from the companies to support his own investments, as well as allegedly pay for an \u201coutrageously lavish\u201d lifestyle of luxury cars, famous art and \u201cjewelry and rent-free apartments for his mistresses.\u201d\nAnd when her brother asked her to sign documents related to the family business, he told her there was nothing new in the paperwork, Homapour claimed. Instead, those agreements allowed Harounian to compensate himself for his work as manager.\nHomapour argued this was fraud. But a judge said that claim doesn\u2019t hold up when Homapour admits she didn\u2019t read or inquire about what she was signing.\n\n\u201cThis is putting to bed the scandalous and unsupported claims of fraud and clearing Mark Harounian\u2019s good name,\u201d said Todd Soloway, an attorney for Harounian.\nThe judge similarly dismissed other efforts by Homapour to get a quick decision to set up a trust for the assets and get her brother removed as a member of the LLCs.\nThe case will now be sent to trial, where the parties will argue over whether Harounian\u2019s compensation from the companies was reasonable.\nAttorneys for Homapour said they were pleased the court is bringing those claims about the compensation to trial and also ordered Harounian to give a full accounting of company finances.\n\u201cThis decision is another significantly positive step towards our client ultimately recovering the tens of millions of dollars Mark wrongfully took from the family companies,\u201d Homapour\u2019s attorneys, Terrence Oved, Darren Oved and Glen Lenihan at Oved &amp; Oved LLP, said in a statement.\nThe case is just one battle in the family\u2019s civil war. Patriarch Jacob Harounian has sued Mark for similar claims in a case that is still ongoing. A company Mark manages won its own case against Jacob in 2023, claiming that he wired himself $5 million from a company account.\n",

        "content": "Overall, there were 253 deals, totaling about $475 million, recorded in New York City on Wednesday, Aug. 13.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nCentral Park Tower at\n217 West 57th Street\nin Midtown notched the highest residential sale in New York.\nMatthew Kaulig\n, owner of the NASCAR team Kaulig Racing, and his wife\nLisa Kaulig\ndropped about $17.6 million \u2014 about $5,200 per square foot \u2014\u00a0on a sponsor unit at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, which was developed by\nGary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development Company\n. The 3,400-square-foot, three-bedroom unit first hit the market in August of 2022, with an asking price of $22.6 million, but its most recent asking price was $18.9 million. Extell Marketing Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini\nand\nTim Rizzo\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nNew York\u2019s top commercial real estate transaction was in Glendale. The Shops at Atlas Park, an open-air shopping center at\n80-00 Cooper Avenue\n, traded for $72 million. The buyer was\nBen Ashkenazy\u2019s Askenazy Acquisition Corp.\n, and the seller was California-based\nMacerich.\nThe property, which is 97 percent leased, spans 370,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $195 per square foot. Macerich had owned the mall since 2011, when the firm purchased it via a foreclosure auction for $54 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Bay Ridge, the\nGindi family\u2019s\nsale of the former Century 21 flagship store in Bay Ridge for $47.5 million hit records. The buyer was a joint venture between Baltimore-based\nMCB Real Estate\nand Istanbul-based\nOsiris Ventures.\nThe 14-parcel property spans 95,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $500 per square foot. The buyers plan to redevelop the site into a grocery-anchored shopping center. JLL\u2019s\nEthan Stanton, Jeffrey Julien\nand\nBrendan Maddigan\narranged the deal.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA company managed by\nKim Soonbin\noffloaded a 36-unit apartment complex at\n331 Keap Street\nin East Williamsburg. The buyer, an LLC tied to\nJanusz Sendowski\n, paid just over $9 million for the nearly 22,000-square-foot, six-story building. The seller bought the property about six years ago for $15.5 million. The latest deal marks a nearly 42 percent loss.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Michael and Kelly Kong\npaid $9.8 million for a townhouse at\n37 West 74th Street\non the Upper West Side. The seller,\nKensington Investments Limited\n, had owned the building for decades.

The buyers were\nBrian Davis\n, a financial executive, and\nCayla O\u2019Connell Davis\n, a fashion entrepreneur, who paid just under $9 million for the pad. The Apples purchased the unit in 2013 for about $7.8 million, then listed it for sale in January for $9.5 million. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nAmanda Cannon Goldworm, Megan Duryea Scott, Merrill Curtis\nand\nGeoff McKernan\nrepresented the sellers.\nBy the Numbers:\nMiami ranks No. 1 for super-rich second homeowners \u2014 but New York boasts most ultra-wealthy homeowners\nMiami is the No. 1 spot \u2014 on the planet \u2014 for the super-rich to purchase second homes, according to a report from Altrata, a data provider for the wealth industry.\nMore than 13,200 ultra-high-net-worth people, or those with a net worth of more than $30 million, have second properties in Miami. That\u2019s about three-fourths of Miami\u2019s ultra-high-net-worth population \u2014 the greatest share of the top 20 cities.\nThe city with the most super-wealthy homeowners is New York, which has more than 33,200 owners in that category.

        "content": "New York has a long, drawn-out process for foreclosing on homes.\nThat is by design: Homeowners are given time because the loss of their primary residence can be catastrophic and is often avoidable. Residential foreclosures shouldn\u2019t be rushed.\nIn contrast, non-judicial UCC foreclosures are fast \u2014 60 days, and notices are limited. The process is intended for commercial properties, whose owners are sophisticated enough to deal with it.\nUnfortunately, it also applies to co-op shares owned by regular people.\nLet\u2019s say Mrs. Smith suffers from dementia, forgets to pay her monthly maintenance charges for a while and stops reading her mail. The co-op board can foreclose on her shares and sell the unit at an auction on the courthouse steps.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for clueless owners to show up and ask the auctioneer what\u2019s going on, only to be told their home is being sold by the board \u2014 even though its market value far exceeds the unpaid dues. Some real estate professionals are regulars at these auctions, looking to buy co-op units for a fraction of their market value, as my colleague Keith Larsen has\nwritten\n.\nSometimes the buyer is the co-op board itself, hoping to recoup the arrears (and then some) by buying and reselling the unit.\nWe have even heard of situations where the winning bidder is rejected by the co-op board, forcing another auction to be held. The board keeps rejecting winners until it becomes the sole bidder. It\u2019s unclear how often this happens, but it\u2019s said to be common at some buildings. Even one instance is too many.\nProblems with UCC foreclosures on co-ops do not appear to be on politicians\u2019 radar. An ideal system would balance the interests of co-op boards, delinquent shareholders and buyers.\nA protracted, bureaucratic process would be unfair to boards trying to collect maintenance fees, but neither should people lose their homes in 60 days because they owe a modest amount of money and didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat reform would you suggest for dealing with unpaid co-op dues? Should a guardian be appointed for the homeowner, allowing for a home equity loan or traditional sale that would pay the arrears and put any excess in the seller\u2019s pocket? Or could a cure be worse than the problem?\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Labyrinth, a company focused on streamlining permitting, came up with a \u201c\nred tape index\n\u201d to measure how efficiently states and localities process building permits, zoning changes and related approvals.\n\nNot coincidentally, the worst performers were the states with the most expensive housing markets.\nMassachusetts was 45th, followed by Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and the absolute worst, Hawaii.\nTennessee claimed the best score, followed by Florida, Texas, Indiana and Arizona.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A developer of Pacific Park wasn\u2019t fined by New York state for missing key deadlines because the firm threatened to sue, according to\nGothamist\n. Greenland USA would have faced more than $1.75 million in monthly penalties after failing to complete 876 units of affordable housing by the\nMay 31 deadline\n. Greenland cited \u201cunavoidable delays.\u201d The decks over the rail yard that were supposed to support the new housing have\nyet to be built\n.\n\u2014 The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated five Garment District buildings as historical landmarks ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote on the Midtown South rezoning,\namNY\nreported. If the City Council signs off on the designation, any future changes to the exterior or structure of the buildings would need to be approved by the LPC.\n\u2014 City officials published a new master plan for New York\u2019s greenways,\nGothamist\nreported. The plan aims to connect more of the city\u2019s existing greenways and includes 40 miles of new paths.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.8 million\nfor a 6,576-square-foot townhouse at 37 West 74th Street on the Upper West Side. Roberta Golubock of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial sale recorded was for five properties in Bay Ridge by ASG Equities to MCB Real Estate and Osiris Ventures for $43.6 million.\nThe Real Deal\nreported the deal Aug. 5.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 4,089-square-foot condominium unit in The Cortland at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of Core NYC has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 391,830-square-foot, 387-unit residential building at 23-07 43 Avenue in Long Island City. Handel Architects filed the permit on behalf of William Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Su-Mei Yen couldn\u2019t dig herself out of distress at her big South Loop hotel development in time to avoid her lender\u2019s wrath, according to a recent lawsuit.\nSan Francisco-based lender ACORE Capital filed a $187 million foreclosure complaint against the owners of 1100 South Michigan and 1101 South Wabash Avenues, including the Yen family\u2019s firm, Hinsdale-based SB Yen, which also employs the longtime Chicago hotelier\u2019s relatives Bert and Cassie.\nThe lender\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit threatens to strip the landlords of their control of the lodging property, which includes the 172-room Best Western Hotel on Michigan Avenue they renovated in recent years as well as the Homewood Suites by Hilton on Wabash Avenue, which consists of 196 hotel rooms, and a separate 85-room extended stay suites section plus ground-floor retail they built in 2018.\nThe Yens poured at least $3.7 million into extending the loan\u2019s maturity date, which originally was set to come due in 2022, when the aftermath of the pandemic was still weighing heavily on the travel and lodging industries.\nMeanwhile, investors hailing from China say they collectively raised more than $18 million for real estate projects backed by SB Yen, including the South Loop developments, but Yen and her children allegedly mismanaged the money. The funds were raised through the federal EB-5 program that allows foreigners to obtain U.S. visas in exchange for investments in real estate projects, but some of the investors say they never gained permanent residency due to SB Yen\u2019s financial missteps. Their lawsuit against Yen expanded in recent months from three plaintiffs who had put $1.5 million into SB Yen to now more than three dozen who each contributed at least $550,000.\nThe funds were meant to go into renovating the Best Western Grant Park Hotel at 1100 South Michigan and developing the newer, neighboring 30-story mixed-use tower at 1101 South Wabash.\nThey claim a conflict of interest arose due to Cassie Yen controlling the EB-5 lender vehicle while her mother Su-Mei Yen controlled the borrower entities. The investors allege the Yens \u201centered into an agreement to misappropriate funds from the company, to intentionally allow the loan to default, and to intentionally conceal the loan\u2019s status\u201d from the investors, their lawsuit said.\nSu-Mei Yen and an attorney for SB Yen didn\u2019t return requests for comment. An attorney for Lotus declined to comment, and representatives of ACORE didn\u2019t return requests for comment on how the EB-5 investors\u2019 lawsuit may impact the foreclosure proceedings.\n\nEven though the investors and ACORE are seeking a total of over $202 million from the Yens \u2014 who have owned and operated Chicago hotels for decades \u2014 their Gold Coast and Evanston properties have so far wiggled out of precarious financial situations in the post-pandemic era.\nAfter a brush with a previous lender in 2022, their 97-year-old Whitehall Hotel on the Gold Coast, at 105 East Delaware Place, is carrying a $50 million loan that so far remains intact, but is set to mature later this year, according to public records. Su-Mei Yen has owned the Whitehall since 1992. Her 259-room Evanston property, at 1501 Sherman Avenue, earlier this year also had its mortgage expanded by 30 percent to a total principal amount of $13 million, public records show.\nYen also got a New York judge to dismiss her as an individual from a lawsuit filed by a debt restructuring firm, Lotus Capital, that negotiated a loan extension on the ACORE deal for the South Loop properties. Her firm SB Yen in March settled with Lotus, though the terms weren\u2019t disclosed, after the brokerage claimed it wasn\u2019t paid its $700,000 fee for its services for the hotel firm.\nBut ACORE is now alleging that after it granted forbearance to SB Yen for its loan three times, in 2020, 2021 and and again in 2024 ahead of its September 2024 maturity date, the borrower has violated its agreements with the lender by failing to deposit hotel revenue in recent months.\nThe lender claims the account that SB Yen is supposed to fund with the South Loop hotel revenues is \u201csignificantly short,\u201d including by about $2 million during peak summer months.\n\u201cMoreover, borrower has admitted to [ACORE] that, instead of remitting revenues to the clearing account, these amounts have been used to repay cash fundings from borrower\u2019s affiliates,\u201d the lender said in its suit.\nThe complaint also alleges SB Yen agreed to pay a forbearance fee of $600,000 in June 2024 but never coughed up the money, constituting yet another event of default.\nDue to interest and fees, the unpaid balance on the debt has swelled to over $187 million despite being originated for just $146 million in 2019, with over $60,000 being added to the loan each day it remains in default, the lawsuit said.",

That amounts to $436,590 per unit. Newmark brokers Elizabeth Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson are marketing the 49-story building, called the Streeter.\nThe asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed. STRS Ohio\u2019s portfolio encompasses a range of\nproperties\n, including retail and multifamily.\nRents are rising among downtown Chicago apartment buildings, up 6.25 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. Inflationary pressures in construction costs and high interest rates have dampened apartment starts downtown, contributing to a 30-year low on apartment deliveries and increased demand for space in the older units.\nLocal developer Golub partnered with AEW Capital Partners and BlackRock Realty Advisors in 2006 to build the Streeter. The building is 99 percent occupied and rent averages $3,749 per month, about $3.96 per square foot, according to CoStar.\n\nNearby listings include Miami-based Crescent Heights\u2019 398-unit North Water Apartments, at 340 East North Water Street in Streeterville, which hit the market in April. Crescent Heights\npurchased\nthe multifamily component of the building in June 2023 for $173 million ($435,000 per unit), a bargain compared to its $240 million trade in 2016. That property was listed as 93 percent occupied with similar average rents of $3,574 per unit or $3.93 per square foot, according to marketing materials.\nThe Chicago suburbs especially are attracting multifamily investors, with transactions jumping\n65 percent year-over-year\nin March, according to Interra Realty.\nMajor transactions this year include\nMoceri &amp; Roszak\u2019s sale\nof the 375-unit Fulbrix Apartments in Fulton Market for $170 million, or $453,333 per unit, marking the city\u2019s largest apartment sale in nearly two years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Renovation is underway for an aging Oak Cliff apartment complex that was at the center of a bribery case.\nNew York-based Fairstead purchased the 168-unit Royal Crest Apartments at 3558 Wilhurt Avenue. Fairstead secured a $33 million renovation loan from Capital One, according to county records, amounting to almost $198,000 per unit. Fairstead stated that total rehabilitation costs will be about $24 million, or $142,857 per unit.\nThe seller is AmeriSouth Realty Group, owned by Ruel Hamilton, a local developer\nrecently acquitted of bribery\nin a retrial. Hamilton was previously convicted of bribing a Dallas City Council member between 2013 and 2015 to gain support for a renovation of Royal Crest.\nThe Section 8 subsidized housing development was built in 1969 and hasn\u2019t undergone a substantial renovation in five decades, according to Fairstead. The renovations will include energy efficiency features, a computer lab, a children\u2019s play area and an improved laundry facility. The renovated community center will also offer career training, financial literacy courses and after-school programming for K-12 students.\n\nFairstead\u2019s portfolio spans 28 states and includes over a thousand units in Texas, but this project is the company\u2019s first Texas rehabilitation, according to a news release. Renovation began this month and is expected to wrap up in fall of 2026.\nMore development is expected\nin West Oak Cliff\nafter the Dallas City Council voted on Wednesday to rezone 35 acres for residential and mixed-use development. Proponents said rezoning will encourage development of vacant lots, but opponents said rezoning could price out current residents.\nAnother affordable housing development is planned for a\nWest Oak Cliff church site\n. Generation Partners is demolishing the former Templo de Alabanza church at 4710 West Illinois Avenue to make way for a 22-unit development that will offer services similar to Fairstead\u2019s at Royal Crest, including financial literacy programs and free tax preparation.\nOther recent trades in Oak Cliff include 1235 Hartsdale Drive, a 94-unit multifamily property purchased by syndicators Cody Gustafson and Robert Slattery last month.\n",

There is already space for four simultaneous productions, SGS Studios co-founder David Glasser told the outlet.\n\u201cIt will be something that hasn\u2019t been done in Texas before,\u201d Glasser said. Glasser is also the CEO of 101 Studios.\n\nTwo buildings spanning 450,000 square feet have already been built, and some scenes for Sheridan\u2019s show \u201cLandman\u201d were filmed there. Hillwood\u2019s conversion of the two buildings to studio space was estimated to cost $65 million, or $144 per square foot.\nThe Texas incentives are expected to boost the local film industry in an effort to compete with Los Angeles and Georgia. SGS Studios and 101 Studios are reportedly working with a local community college to train students for film jobs.\nIn recent years film studios have been announced elsewhere in Texas, including\nHill Country Studios\nin San Marcos, a 209-acre project announced in 2023 and led by Cory McLoud and Netflix studios veteran Kevin Bar. Los Angeles-based Creative Tank\u2019s Super Studios in Mansfield is slated to include 400,000 square feet of sound stages as well as hotel, retail and residential components.\nBastrop 552\n, a 456-acre, $50 million studio is proposed by developer Alton Butler. And the $100 million\nWyldwood Studios\nis also planned for Bastrop by actor Zachary Levi.\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles is losing ground in the industry. On-location filming in Los Angeles fell 22 percent in the first quarter year-over-year, with soundstage occupancy dropping to 63 percent, according to FilmLA.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property sold for $1 million in 1984, $375,000 in 1977 and $235,000 in 1971.\nThe three-story manse, built in 1927, sits in a 2.2-acre lot and spans 7,245 square feet with four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. The home also features a four-car garage and views of the Pacific Ocean and Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nOther big-ticket transactions in the county this year include a Carmel Highlands estate that\nsold\nin June for $14.8 million, a property in Carmel that sold for $15.5 million that same month and another Carmel estate in April that traded hands for $17.5 million.\n\nThe median listing home price in Pebble Beach as of June was $3.5 million, representing an 8 percent drop year-over-year, according to the Business Journal. The median sale price was $2.8 million with homes spending about 10 weeks on the market.\nPebble Beach ranks above the exclusive Carmel-by-the-Sea enclave where the median listing price is $3 million.

Across the county, listings averaged about $1.3 million in June; by contrast, the median listing price in Santa Clara County, the capital of Silicon Valley, was $1.5 million in June. Sales there closed at a median price of $1.7 million.\nElsewhere in Pebble Beach, other high-end properties are on the market including a four-bedroom for $13.3 million, a five-bedroom for $15 million and an eight-bedroom estate for $29 million, per the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Manhattan rental market is hotter than ever. Again.\nThe median rent for a brokered Manhattan apartment reached $4,700 in July, a 9.3 percent change from a year earlier, according to the newest report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. It\u2019s a new record for the borough, the fifth in the last six months.\nThe record prices come amid a mayoral race that has been notably focused on housing affordability. Frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo blast each other not only on their housing plans but also on their\npersonal living situations\n, no reprieve from high rents is expected to turn voters\u2019 attentions elsewhere.\n\u201cEven if rents stop their ascent, there certainly won\u2019t be a quick pivot to affordability,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, author of the report.\nThe record prices began in February, unusual timing for the city where rents peak in summer. But mortgage rates have put pressure on the sales market, prompting some would-be buyers to wait it out in the rental market, Miller said. Interest rate cuts, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for this week, could relieve some of that pressure.\nBut elevated demand is also carrying the market to record highs. At Fetner Properties, which advertises luxury high-rise buildings, leadership estimates they\u2019ve raised rents an average of 5 or 6 percent across the portfolio in the past year while also updating amenity packages.\n\n\u201cThe rents are spectacular,\u201d said Hal Fetner, president and CEO. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of new supply coming into the market and then there\u2019s an insatiable demand of professionals who are continuing to look for units.\u201d\nManhattan, Brooklyn and Northwest Queens all saw record highs in the share of apartments subject to bidding wars, 29 percent in Manhattan, 36 percent in Brooklyn, and 27 percent in Queens.\nIn Manhattan, the rise in prices is primarily driven by studios and one-bedrooms, Miller said. The vacancy rate in the borough was 2.45 percent. Apartments were on the market for an average of 28 days, down from 32 last July.\nThe FARE Act, which went into effect in June, is also likely to be pushing up rents, at least slightly. The law prohibits brokers from charging fees to tenants who didn\u2019t hire them. If landlords pay for brokers themselves, they\u2019re likely to try to recoup that cost through higher prices.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn rose to the second-highest on record, at $3,850 for a brokered apartment. That was a 7 percent change from last July. Listing inventory fell 7 percent year over year.\nIn Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, median rent was $3,750, a nearly 9 percent increase year-over-year.\n",

But developers must meet four conditions addressing accessibility, lighting, building materials and environmental concerns in order to move forward.\nCommissioners instructed the development team, composed of applicant Rusnak/Pasadena and architect Goree Whitfield, to revise the Colorado Boulevard frontage to ensure people of all abilities can enter the plaza via the same path, thereby eliminating a separate accessible route.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a much more elegant solution where you don\u2019t actually separate people with different abilities,\u201d Commissioner Srinivas Rao said, per Pasadena Now.\nCity zoning rules restricting upward-facing lighting also require the developer to create a glare-reducing lighting plan for the sides and rear of the building. \u201cThe zoning code does have requirements for shielding and downlight,\u201d Pasadena Principal Planner Kevin Johnson pointed out.\n\nIn addition, the team will have to lighten the color of the brick used on large wall areas to prevent a uniform monolithic exterior and to create contrast with the aluminum composite panels on the building. Officials said the current plan for dark brick might be an eyesore to pedestrians and took away from the visual warmth common in Pasadena.\nThe team will also have to adhere to the tweaked plans for the ground of the plaza. The applicant proposed using\u00a0 artificial turf \u201cpods\u201d beneath the public art installation in place of previously proposed \u201cturf block\u201d plantings due to maintenance issues under parked cars.\nPlanning Commission Chair Julianna Delgado wants the team to steer clear of synthetic turf entirely, citing its fossil fuel origins, heat-island effects and water-use implications. The commission is requiring a sustainability review of the proposed material and comparison with greener alternatives in order to advance.\nThe historic Swanson &amp; Peterson Furniture Factory building on the new site is not eligible for historic designation, according to city staff. While the owner plans to keep the structure, any major alterations would trigger additional design review by the city.\nNow that the dealership design has been approved, the project will have to secure building permits and a plan check, whereby officials verify compliance with both interdepartmental and commission-imposed conditions.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York State decided not to collect millions in fines from Greenland USA for blowing past affordable housing deadlines at the long-delayed Atlantic Yards redevelopment after the developer threatened to sue if the state tried.\nThe Chinese firm was supposed to deliver nearly 900 affordable units by the end of May under a 2014 settlement, or face $1.75 million in monthly penalties \u2014 $2,000 per incomplete unit. But 11 years later, Greenland hasn\u2019t even broken ground on the railyard platform where many of those apartments were planned, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nInstead, Empire State Development officials told a local task force earlier this month that the fines \u2014 earmarked for a city affordable housing trust fund \u2014 won\u2019t accrue and won\u2019t be collected. The fund could have topped $5.25 million by now.\nGreenland, which defaulted on a $350 million investor loan in 2023, has cited \u201cunavoidable delays,\u201d including lack of subsidies and slow MTA approvals, as reasons for missing deadlines. ESD says it disputes those claims but acknowledged the company\u2019s warning that any attempt to collect penalties would trigger litigation and stall the project further.\nFirst pitched in 2003, Atlantic Yards \u2014 rebranded Pacific Park \u2014 was supposed to deliver 2,250 affordable apartments alongside market-rate housing, offices and the Barclays Center. To date, 1,374 affordable units have been built and the railyard platform remains a vacant promise.\n\nThe state expects to approve a transfer of development rights next month to a joint venture involving Cirrus Real Estate Partners,\nLCOR\nand Greenland. The revised plan folds in nearby retail parcels, including a shuttered Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son; Greenland will retain partial control despite failing to meet its obligations.\nThe no-fines move has enraged some community leaders, who say the state is bailing out a developer that seized land through eminent domain and then failed to deliver.\nAssemblymember Jo Ann Simon called Greenland\u2019s lawsuit threat \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you consider defaulting on your debt as an unavoidable delay, that\u2019s an argument, but it\u2019s a stretch to hang it on ESD.\u201d\nOthers, including former city housing official and consultant Jordan Barowitz, said the threat is an unsurprising developer tactic and that piling on fines could make a financially shaky project even less likely to get built.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "It took a couple of trying years, but former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is cutting his last residential real estate ties to the Big Apple.\nThe two-time mayor and one-time lawyer for President Donald Trump sold his unit at 45 East 66th Street in the Upper East Side for slightly under $5 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The identity of the buyer was not disclosed. The deal works out to about $500 per square foot.\nGiuliani listed his co-op almost exactly two years ago,\nseeking $6.5 million\n. He purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002.\nHis estranged wife Judith reportedly lived in the unit until May 2019. Rudy held on to the co-op after the couple divorced, but Judith received their home in Water Mill, which she then\nsold\nin 2021 for $5 million.\nUnfortunately for Rudy, Judith\u2019s name was still on the deed as he sought to sell the apartment before he bought her out last month for $2.5 million.\nThe 10,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit includes a wood-burning fireplace, a semi-private elevator landing and location just over a block away from Central Park.\n\nThe last asking price for the unit was $5.2 million when the co-op was put back on the market in March. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman had the initial listing, but it\u2019s unclear who was marketing the property at the time of the sale.\nBetween the 2023 listing and the sale, Giuliani almost\nlost the apartment\n. He was ordered to surrender the unit as part of a $146 million judgment for the alleged defamation of two Georgia poll workers in 2020, when the former mayor pushed the false narrative that the presidential vote was rigged against Trump.\nGiuliani ultimately retained possession of the unit after reaching an undisclosed settlement with the poll workers. He is set to live full-time in Florida, according to his attorney.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Billionaires Vlad Doronin and Len Blavatnik\u2019s delayed Aman Miami Beach is moving forward with new mezzanine financing.\nRecords show the developer secured $85 million in mezzanine debt for the property in early August from Aman Miami Beach Mezz LLC, which is an affiliate of New York-based GoldenTree Asset Management. This week, Doronin\u2019s OKO and Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries announced the start of vertical construction at the oceanfront construction site at 3425 Collins Avenue.\nThe financing adds to the more than\n$277 million in debt\nprovided by Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK in 2020 and 2023.\nA spokesperson for OKO said the mezzanine loan \u201creflects OKO Group\u2019s ability to secure strategic financing and to position the project for continued momentum as we move through key construction milestones.\u201d\nThe condo component of the project, previously expected to be completed in 2024 and more recently, in 2026, is now expected to be completed in 2027, according to a press release. Complicated site work has held up vertical construction.\nThe general contractor, Suffolk Construction, is working to complete one floor every two weeks now that the foundation is completed, following \u201cextensive below-grade piling, excavation work and construction,\u201d according to the release. The work included building a two-story underground parking garage via deep soil and triple soil mixing.\n\nUnderground parking, especially on the oceanfront, is complex and expensive to develop.\nThe condo portion has been fully presold for years. The project will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in a new 18-story building and the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure, which is currently a shell. The condo tower was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Jean-Michel Gathy of Denniston, who has designed hotels for Aman, Four Seasons, Cheval Blanc and St. Regis, is designing restoration and redevelopment of the Versailles Hotel.\nThe condo portion sold out in 2021 for an average price of $5,000 per square foot, according to OKO\u2019s spokesperson. The blended price per square foot marked a record at the time, but penthouses at existing and planned oceanfront condo projects now surpass that. In late July, a penthouse at Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club sold for\n$6,700 per square foot\n, or a total price of $38.2 million. A penthouse at Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge-branded Shore Club development in Miami Beach is in contract to sell for more than\n$11,000 per square foot\n.\nAman Miami Beach\nmarks the next phase within the Faena District in Miami Beach, and the first Aman property in Florida. Doronin is chairman and CEO of the Switzerland-based ultra-luxury hospitality group.\nThe condo and hotel project sits next to Faena House, a luxury condo building completed in 2015 that attracted billionaire buyers who included hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and Jamie Dinan. Backed by Blavatnik, Alan Faena developed Faena House, Faena Hotel and Faena Forum. He planned to develop the Versailles site, but that project was canceled in 2016 due to the condo market slowdown. Doronin joined Blavatnik in 2020.\u00a0Even though Aman Miami Beach sold out early in the pandemic, the project is part of a wave of ultra-luxury condo and boutique hotel developments planned on the oceanfront on Collins Avenue, including the Shore Club and the Raleigh farther south. While Witkoff\u2019s Shore Club has been performing well, developer Michael Shvo could lose the\nRaleigh to Nahla Capital\n.\n",

The 4-million-square-foot project could eventually include up to 1,900 apartments and condos, 39,000 square feet of retail, office space, a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces. Madison Realty Capital provided the developer with a\n$310 million construction loan\nin 2021.\nThe first phase is almost done.

Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital arranged the recapitalization and financing.\nNeumann, who co-founded WeWork, has been expanding his Flow empire in South Florida and abroad \u2014 including in\nSaudi Arabia\n.\n\nFlow is developing a three-tower apartment, office and retail project in Aventura; an apartment and commercial complex in El Portal; a 466-unit\nFlow-branded condo tower\nat Miami Worldcenter; and the completed Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale apartment buildings.\nFlow is partnering with Canada Global on more than 9 million square feet of mixed-use projects, including about 5,000 apartments, according to the release. Flow purchased 30 percent of Canada Global, an Israeli real estate investment company led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, for about $27 million, according to\nCalcalist\n.\nThe Chetrit family has had the Miami River project in the works for\nmore than a decade\n. The Miami City Commission\napproved\na major site rezoning and the project\u2019s development agreement in 2015.\nLate last year, Chetrit\npartnered\nwith Montreal-based Lotus International on Chetrit\u2019s long-awaited Miami Beach hotel project, the redevelopment of the Collins Park Hotel at 2000 Park Avenue. Chetrit also secured an $88 million refinancing for the loan backing the property.\nThe Chetrit family\u2019s empire includes the Chetrit Group and the Chetrit Organization, both of which have been tied up in litigation as of late. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is alleging the Chetrit Group, led by Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, allowed a Times Square property once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cdirtiest\u201d hotel to deteriorate after defaulting on a $233 million loan.\n",

Horton, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nPrices will range from about $300,000 to $450,000, with floor plans spanning 1,200 to 3,000 square feet. The Houston area\u2019s median home price was $349,950 in July, according to Redfin.\nThe community will be built in phases, and sales for the first 410 homes is anticipated to begin in the first half of next year. About a third of the land area \u2014 133 acres \u2014 will be set aside for outdoor amenities, such as a community pool, pavilion, playgrounds, sports fields and walking trails.\nHolly Ridge is one of the latest examples of Houston-area developers setting their sights on the metro\u2019s outer fringes.\n\nGreater Houston is one of the biggest markets in the country for master-planned community development. Home sales in such communities slid in the past year, on trend with the wider home-buying market. New home sales in the country\u2019s top master-planned communities\ndropped nearly 7 percent\nfrom June 2024 to June 2025, according to real estate consultant RCLCO.\nSignorelli is also developing a 4,700-acre development in Rosenberg called\nAustin Point\n, which it started in 2023, and model home construction began in June. That development includes 14,000 home lots, along with 15 million square feet of multifamily, office, retail and hospitality space.\nAlso in Rosenberg, Houston-based developer Hines began building the 2,500-home Brookewater community last year, and\nelsewhere\nin Fort Bend County, it bought 3,000 acres east of\nFulshear\nin the northeast part of the county for a 7,000 home community.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A penthouse with a private rooftop hot tub has set a record for the priciest condo sale in Greenpoint.\nThe top-floor duplex at 524 Manhattan Avenue sold for $5.975 million in an off-market deal, a surprise entrant into a neighborhood that has thus far been dominated by new development sales at the top of the market.\nChubet previously listed the apartment for $8 million in 2022 before taking it off the market at the start of 2024. He said he had since listed it as a Compass Private Exclusive, before receiving a call from Jones, who had been checking in on delisted apartments that fit his client\u2019s requirements.\nThe sale unseats a penthouse unit at Quadrum Global\u2019s The Huron on 29 Huron Street\nthat sold for $5.7 million\n, or roughly $2,400 per square foot, last October.\nIt would have had a claim as the most expensive deal in Greenpoint, if not for a two-family home at\n111 Noble Street\nthat closed for $6.9 million in July. The all-cash buyer paid roughly $1,200 per square foot for the roughly 6,000-square-foot home.\nIn North Brooklyn, the median price of homes sold rose 6 percent year-over-year to $1.46 million, but the average price per square foot fell 2 percent to $1,483, according to Corcoran\u2019s second quarter market report.\nThe 1,780-square-foot home overlooking McCarren Park comes with two primary bedrooms, three bathrooms and an additional 680 exterior square feet. The deal comes out to over $3,300 per interior square foot.\nThe seller underwent a $2 million renovation that involved receiving board and city approval to create a recreational rooftop with a private hot tub, according to Compass\u2019 John Chubet, who had the listing.\n\nThe seller bought the home for $1.9 million in 2019, according to public records. The seller is an LLC tied to Ronen Segev, who sells pre-owned Steinway Pianos through his business Park Avenue Pianos.\nA keyed elevator opens into the triple-height great room, which opens up to the eat-in kitchen.\nThe top-floor home has floor-to-ceiling windows in the great room, along with one of the three terraces. Both of the primary bedrooms, one of which is on the second floor accessed by a staircase off the living area, also have terraces.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the 57th Street Billionaires\u2019 Row views,\u201d Chubet said. \u201cThis one\u2019s different, in that it\u2019s more bespoke \u2014 it\u2019s uniquely Brooklyn.\u201d\nThe roof terrace features a custom western cedar round hot tub, outdoor kitchen and a heated cabana with a retractable roof.\nNest Seekers\u2019 Cornell Jones brought the buyer, who he said had been renting another unit on McCarren Park and was looking for a multi-floor unit in the area with outdoor space.\nAfter initially touring the home in February, Jones\u2019 client had concerns about the closet space, but ultimately returned to the unit after touring other potential options.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful apartment, there\u2019s not anything like it,\u201d Jones said.\n",

The company, founded last year, is planning to relocate its San Francisco headquarters, currently spanning 3,400 square feet at 375 Alabama Street in the Mission District.\nResolve\u2019s new offices will be in the south building of the two-building 350 Rhode Island complex.\nPCCP\nowns the south building, previously home to the headquarters of internet-of-things company Samsara, which\nmoved to South of Market in 2019\nand began\nleasing all of the One De Haro building in 2021\n.\nResolve has increased its headcount significantly over the past year, according to the Business Times. It\u2019s the latest AI company to pick up office space in San Francisco, though its latest lease stands out as the majority of AI leases are for less than 10,000 square feet of space, per JLL.\n\nLast month, AI robotics startup\nSkild AI\ninked a notable office lease of its own in the Bay Area, grabbing nearly 32,500 square feet at 970 Park Place in San Mateo. The month before that, AI startup\nGlean\n, based in Palo Alto, signed on to expand its Bay Area presence with an additional 45,000-square-foot office in San Francisco.\nThe AI sector was partially responsible for helping lower San Francisco\u2019s office vacancy rate last quarter, marking the third straight quarter it\u2019s gone down, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Times. It fell 1 percent quarter-over-over to 34.8 percent.\nAs it stands, AI firms occupy approximately 5 million square feet of offices today, though CBRE estimates that number to quadruple to 21 million square feet over the next five years. If that happens, it would effectively\ncut San Francisco\u2019s current office vacancy rate\nin half.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One Wall Street, Harry Macklowe\u2019s hulking condo conversion in the Financial District, has scored its priciest sale to date.\nUnit 3304 sold for $9.08 million, or over $3,000 per square foot, according to documents. The deal for the unit, which went into contract with a last asking price of $9.75 million, marks the most expensive residential sale since October 2022.\nThe sale is the neighborhood\u2019s most expensive since a unit at Time Equities\u2019 50 West Street fetched $12 million in October 2022.\nThe deal also marks a bright spot for the massive condo conversion that has otherwise\nmade headlines for the deals it hasn\u2019t done\n. But after averaging fewer than three contracts per month since sales launched in 2021, the building netted seven deals in July.\nAnd after selling just two, three-bedroom units, the project has added four contracts for homes of the same size to its tally this year.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Richard Rothbloom brought the buyer.\nSpanning almost 3,000 square feet, Unit 3304 has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The home came furnished by Brazilian furniture house Artefacto, one of four units the building has put up for sale as move-in ready. Another turnkey unit went into contract at the end of July, asking $3.5 million.\nRothbloom said the buyer, who already lived in the neighborhood and won\u2019t be keeping the furniture in the unit, gravitated to the building because of its amenity package compared to other projects in the area.\nThe corner unit has harbor and Hudson River views, along with a 1,400 square-foot wraparound terrace.\nThe building is seeking to attract a different clientele than the young renters and deal-seekers who have historically populated the area, dangling amenities like a private restaurant, 75-foot pool on the 38th floor and complimentary membership to the Life Time fitness club in the building.\n\nDespite the small signs of progress, the sales finish line is still a ways off. One Wall has sold just a quarter of its units, and no units above the 33rd floor in the 49-story building.\nMacklowe is seeking nearly $2,500 per square foot on average for the units in the building, with many of the top-floor units asking over $3,000 per square foot, according to Marketproof. The average price per square foot in the Financial District was just over $1,400, according to Corcoran\u2019s second quarter market report.\nSales are being handled by an in-house team that includes former Douglas Elliman brokers Lenny Inzirillo and Jacob Franco, who\ntook over from Compass in May 2024\n. Macklowe Properties\u2019 Anna Zarro and Matthew Chook are overseeing the in-house sales approach.\nThe sales team has dropped prices on a number of units this year, with drastic discounts in some cases. A 28th-floor unit hit the market at the end of January asking $3.9 million, down from its original asking price of $5.8 million in the original offering plan.\n\u201cThere are buyers out there purchasing, [the home] just needs to be in the correct [price] range,\u201d Rothbloom said.\nThe property is also\nfacing increased competition in the neighborhood\u2019s luxury offerings\n.\nBizzi &amp; Partners, Bilgili Holdings and Fortress Investment Group\u2019s project at 125 Greenwich began closings earlier this year, while Trinity Place Holdings\u2019 77 Greenwich has slowly marched towards sellout on its 89 units.\nThose two buildings and One Wall Street have been FiDi\u2019s best-selling condos the last three months, according to Marketproof, led by 125 Greenwich\u2019s average of seven deals per month in the last three months.\nThis year, a penthouse at 130 William Street sold for $7.7 million in February, or just over $3,000 per square foot, according to public records. That unit originally sold for $7.36 million in 2021 before hitting the market again for almost $9 million in 2023.\nThe most expensive sponsor sale this year was another penthouse at 130 William, which sold for almost $7.1 million, or $2,860 per square foot.\n",

The loan comes after Scale Lending in September issued a $135 million construction loan.\nThe refinancing provides a \u201csignificant cash-out\u201d to the developer, according to the Dwight Capital real estate investment trust affiliate.\nThe development features 283 market-rate units and 122 affordable housing units. It qualified for the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, scoring a 35-year tax abatement through 421a, as well as Brownfield tax credits.\nLandstone Capital Group\u2019s Pinchas Vogel and Leah Paskus arranged the transaction.\nUnits do not appear to be available for lease yet. Officials from the developer did not immediately respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBeitel has been keeping plenty busy in the Bronx this summer.\nLast month, Scale \u2014 the lending arm of Slate Property Group \u2014 issued\na $305 million loan\nto Beitel for its project at 355 Exterior Street, also in Mott Haven.

        "content": "Compass\u2019 Russell Grether has been helping his mother-in-law rebuild her Malibu home destroyed in 2018\u2019s Woolsey Fire.\nAfter seven years, she\u2019s in the finishing stages and is likely going to be done by the end of the year, hopefully before Christmas.\n\u201cIt took her probably a year or two to wrap her head around that whole process and then another year or two to get permits,\u201d Grether said. \u201cIt\u2019s seven years later and it\u2019s almost done.\u201d\nShe\u2019s not an anomaly.\nIf the past offers any sense of what\u2019s to come, rebuilding won\u2019t be quick in Malibu.\nAt least 488 homes in the city were destroyed in 2018\u2019s\nWoolsey Fire\n, according to a Malibu Planning Commission report. To date, 205 certificates of occupancy for single-family residences have been granted.\nIn the case of this year\u2019s Palisades Fire that claimed 700 homes in Malibu, a single plan check \u2013 the last step before a building permit is issued \u2013 has been approved, according to city data. Another seven have been submitted and are under review. No permits have been issued.\nNow, the city is scrambling for another recovery blueprint to bounce back from January\u2019s Palisades Fire even as it works its way through ordinances, zoning mazes and deadlines to navigate fallout from the 2018 blaze. For real estate agents on the ground, recovery through the lens of dealmaking has begun to ramp over the past month.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already started working with buyers who are, I think, going to be a part of the recovery story and that\u2019s very exciting to see because there\u2019s always a period of time, or at least what we experienced after Woolsey, where the sentiment was fairly negative for a bit,\u201d said Grether, who is founding partner of Compass\u2019 Malibu office and helms the Grether Group.\nHe\u2019s not the only one seeing the turn.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Cooper Mount, who specializes in Malibu and grew up there, also noted\nbusiness picking up\nover the past four weeks, particularly on Carbon and La Costa beaches, where deals have been closing at anywhere from $5 million for a single lot to $14 million for one-and-a-half to two lots.\nAt the top of this year\u2019s burned lot sales was a property with 60 feet fronting the ocean on Carbon Beach, also known as Billionaire\u2019s Beach. The roughly 12,600-square-foot plot at 22102 Pacific Coast Highway traded for $14 million last Tuesday.\nAmong this year\u2019s five largest lot sales in Malibu, the least expensive trade was for a 6,600-square-foot piece of La Costa Beach land at 21360 Pacific Coast Highway, which sold for $5.1 million last Wednesday.\nAs interest percolates among buyers, people are seeing a way into a highly coveted community with a finite amount of oceanfront property.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any dive in desirability,\u201d Mount said of what\u2019s to come for Malibu real estate. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible place and there\u2019s only so much beach available. There\u2019s only one front row.\u201d\nAnother view\nAn overseas buyer apparently got that memo.\n\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe represented that buyer on the purchase of eight lots on La Costa Beach and one on Carbon Beach, totaling roughly\n$65 million\n.\nThe duo declined to provide additional details on the buyer, but said rebuilding is the intent. Their client has built the back-end infrastructure to do that as efficiently as possible with an in-house consulting team of architects and expeditors.\nNews of the deals was received in some corners with mistrust of a single buyer scooping up multiple lots. Those who understand the regulatory environment and what goes into the building process hold a different view.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, we\u2019re lucky to have somebody like this purchasing these lots and taking the time to rebuild,\u201d Howe said.\nThe process will be a long one as many have seen with the Woolsey Fire recovery.\nIn Malibu, particularly on the beach, building is tough and pricey.\nAnywhere from $2 million to $3 million has to be shelled out pre-construction for infrastructure such as a septic system, seawall barrier protecting properties from waves and flooding and foundational caissons to support homes on the sand. Having the stomach and capital to see those projects through isn\u2019t for everyone. Some who want the community to bounce back quickly, see\neconomies of scale\nand multi-lot deals as one way of moving forward.\n\u201cTheir ultimate goal is to make Malibu not only what it used to be but an even better place,\u201d Littlefield said of his and Howe\u2019s client buying multiple lots. \u201cThey\u2019re going to basically make the best houses on the best beach and make this place great again. They\u2019re just super excited to be at the forefront and they ultimately are going to make this place awesome.\u201d\nPrice creep\nPrices will no doubt rise in a place that\u2019s already\nexpensive to build\n.\n\u201cIf you think prices are high now, it\u2019s going to be more expensive because all the new rules, regulations and inflation is going to make this already premier beachfront even more premiere and expensive,\u201d said Beverly Hills Estates co-founder Branden Williams.\nVideo of Williams, who lives on La Costa Beach, putting out the flames at his home back in January and saving it from destruction has been widely circulated.\nAs a resident, he\u2019s looking at rebuilding from a pragmatic standpoint.\n\u201cMost of these houses needed to be torn down anyways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were little beach shacks from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. A lot of the foundations needed to be redone. They were on little sticks.\u201d\nMany are simply waiting to see what shakes out from local government when it comes to ordinances and infrastructure, in a bid to time construction as close as possible to when those decisions are complete. In other cases, more homeowners\u2019 lots may trickle into the for-sale market as some ultimately decide rebuilding isn\u2019t for them.\nGrether\u2019s wife grew up in Malibu and the couple are now raising their two children there, They welcome \u201csigns of life\u201d that he says are starting to peek through as people return to the city. Unlike other areas burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires, Malibu sat isolated with the closure of Pacific Coast Highway earlier this year.\n\u201cThere is a positivity that is starting to occur, which did not exist previously,\u201d Grether said. \u201cThere were definitely some dark moments after the fire, where it was hard to be super positive, selling the lifestyle-type mentality when it was very dire, so it\u2019s been nice to see that sort of mentality shift.\u201d",

        "content": "Waterfront property in Lake Geneva rarely hits the market, something that prompted a buyer in Lake Geneva to make an offer for a property that wasn\u2019t for sale, and it worked.\nThe 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom home on 1 acre in the South Shore Club development at Lake Geneva sold for $10.1 million this week to a buyer who presented an offer, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The price works out to $1,442 per square foot.\nThe home, at N1626 Lakeside Court, is on the southern shore near the lake just off South Lake Shore Drive. The sale is the second-highest priced home sold in the Wisconsin lakefront area. In June a home sold for almost double. A 5-acre, 10,800-square-foot home at\nW3806 Lackey Lane\nfor $20 million, or $1,852 per square foot.\nDaniel Hodgman of Coldwell Banker represented the buyers and said that they spent two years searching for a home on the lake and had begun networking in the area to see if anyone was willing to sell. Hans Melges of Melges Real Estate represented the sellers, George and Antoinette Flaherty. Melges said they had been considering selling in a few years but the offer pushed forward their decision.\n\nSouth Shore Club is a 38-home development built on the former campus of the Northwestern Military Academy. The homes do not sit directly on the lake but are positioned near the club\u2019s 1,500 feet of lakefront. The club owners association keeps piers and boats for common use among residents, maintained by staff.\nBuilt in 2005, the home was purchased by the Flahertys in 2013. The home features stone walls with built-in staircases, a semi-hidden spiral staircase and other castle-like aesthetic features.\nResidential properties on Lake Geneva have sold in the double-digit millions range in recent years. The historic Aloha Lodge sold last year for $22 million. A\nhome sold\nfor $17 million in 2023 only to be torn down, and in 2022, the estate of Richard Driehaus sold for\n$36 million\nto J. Christopher Reyes and Anna Reyes of Reyes Holdings.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "MetroNational bought a 15-story Houston office tower that was formerly the headquarters of Marathon Oil this week.\nThe 442,000-square-foot tower, at 990 Town and Country Boulevard, is in West Houston along the Katy Freeway Sam Houston Tollway. MetroNational represented itself in the acquisition, the Houston Business Journal r\neported\n.\nConocoPhillips was the seller, represented by JLL\u2019s Jeff Cairns, Brandon Clarke, Sanford Criner, Rick Goings and Kevin McConn. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The building\u2019s taxable value is $164.7 million, according to the Harris Central Appraisal District.\nThe building sits on 3.4 acres and was designed by Houston-based architecture firm Munoz + Albin. It was built in 2022. The Katy Freeway East submarket was attractive due to its single-digit vacancy rates and strong tenant demand in the area, MetroNational said.\nThe firm cited a trend of major employers moving west of downtown following residential population trends, adding that the corridor is one of the most active office markets in the nation.\n\nMarathon Oil exited the tower last year when the company was acquired by ConocoPhillips for $22.5 billion.\nThe acquisition is the latest in a series of recent major real estate moves by MetroNational. It is partnering with Radom Capital, also a Houston-based developer, to transform a 35,000-square-foot warehouse at 1085 Gessner Road into a\nmixed-use hub called Greenside\n, which is in the same area. Plans for that project include 15 small retail spaces, along with office and restaurant space, plus a 1-acre park with a jogging trail and pedestrian paths that connect to nearby retail. Construction is expected to wrap up next year.\nMetroNational is also redeveloping a former Sears site into a 27-acre mixed-use project called\nMemorial Town Square\n. In 2022, the company revived pandemic-postponed plans to a 190,000-square-foot, nine-story\noffice building\nin Memorial City as well. That project wrapped up in 2023.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Scott Rechler closed his\n$1 billion deal\nfor 590 Madison Avenue with a big private equity loan, marking New York City\u2019s largest investment sale in three years.\nMark Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management provided $785 million in debt to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of the Plaza District office tower from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cThis is one of the highest quality buildings in Manhattan with one of the best locations at 57th Street and Madison,\u201d Rechler said. \u201cWith institutions seeking to shed their exposure to office, we view this as a great time to be investing.\u201d\nRXR partnered with Elliott Investment Management on the deal, which closed Thursday.\nThe closing wasn\u2019t without its hiccups.\nRechler signed a contract to buy the building in May, with a closing deadline set for July 31. But RXR needed more time to lock in its financing and got a two-week extension, for which the company had to pay a $5 million fee that was tacked onto the final purchase price.\nRechler said the delay was the result of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in early April unsettling financial markets. He had been negotiating late into the process with Cale Street Partners, a privately held real estate finance firm based in the U.K. and backed by the Kuwait Investment Authority.\nBut RXR ultimately pivoted to Apollo, which earlier this year provided a $575 million loan for the company\u2019s conversion of the 5 Times Square office building into nearly 1,000 apartments. It\u2019s possible that Cale Street could take a piece of the financing deal at a later date.\nThe final debt package is broken down into a $650 million senior loan, a $135 million mezzanine loan and about $60 million in future funding commitments for things like tenant improvements and leasing costs.\nAn Eastdil Secured team led by Will Silverman and Gary Phillips negotiated the sale. Eastdil\u2019s Grant Frankel arranged the debt.\n\nIn the past year, Ohio Teachers signed about 300,000 square feet of leases at the tower \u2014 including a\n100,000 square foot deal with Apollo\nin April \u2014 and Rechler said he\u2019s already got leases out with new tenants for space in the building.\nSome have described the 43-story, 1 million-square-foot property as a B building in an A+ location.\nThe tower was completed in 1983 and shows its age with challenging design features like relatively low ceilings and heating/cooling infrastructure along the outside walls, limiting the amount of exposed window space.\nRechler said the building\u2019s setbacks mitigate some of those challenges and provide enough light and air. He said 590 Madison is \u201cclearly digital\u201d in his paradigm of high-quality \u201cdigital\u201d office buildings versus outdated \u201cfilm\u201d ones.\nRXR plans to renovate the building\u2019s atrium area, and there\u2019s also some potential upside in the retail space, which is currently occupied by the luxury watch seller Tourneau. Retail properties in the area have been bolstered recently by luxury brands like Gucci, Prada and Akris buying spaces on Fifth and Madison avenues.\nRechler said he\u2019s in talks with LMVH, which is also an office tenant at 590, about the building\u2019s retail.\nIt\u2019s been a long road to get to this point.\nRechler said he first took a look at 590 Madison in 1993 when he was working with Odyssey Investment Partners, which teamed up with Ohio Teachers to purchase the building. He made an offer on the tower in 2018 when the sellers put it up for sale, and then made an unsolicited offer sometime in the past two years or so.\nRechler said each offer was roughly in the same area as the $1.08 billion he ultimately paid.\n\u201cPart of the challenge with a lot of these groups and where it becomes interesting is you\u2019ve had these buildings valued at a certain level and it\u2019s hard to sell until that comes down to a level that clears the market,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are opportunities today with a lot of institutions where office valuations have dropped and they\u2019re marking their positions down to reasonable enough levels where it becomes compelling.\u201d\n",

Gary Sefcik with Marcus &amp; Millichap secured the financing.\nRoers is led by co-founders Brian and Kent Roers.\nOne of the projects is Vintana at Vanderbilt, a planned 150-unit apartment community with a mix of workforce housing and market-rate units at 3375 Vanderbilt Beach Road that will be adjacent to the\nRitz-Carlton\ngolf course. The other development is The Karlyn, a 159-unit complex for tenants who are 55 and older at 7576 Immokalee Road.\n\nIn October, the Collier County Commission voted 4-1 to rezone the 5.9-acre site where Vintana at Vanderbilt is planned. It was rezoned from agricultural land to multifamily use, and the maximum number of units was increased from 59 to 150, published reports state. In February, Roers paid $7.6 million for the property.\nAlso last year, Roers paid $5.3 million for The Karlyn 9-acre site, records show. In 2017, the Collier County Commission approved a new zoning district that includes the property, allowing for the construction of 63 townhomes or 200 senior housing units. Prior to Roers\u2019 purchase, Atlanta-based\nPulteGroup\nwas under contract to buy the site with the intention of building a townhome project.

Recently, Aventura-based BH Group and Delray Beach-based Kolter Group completed a\n$100 million\nbuyout of all 36 units at the Bahama Club condominium.

        "content": "Midtown South is officially getting a makeover.\nCity Council on Thursday unanimously approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, which rezones 42 blocks in the Midtown neighborhood for housing development. The rezoning is expected to net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 set aside as affordable, making it the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are facing a city-wide housing crisis,\u201d said Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. \u201cWe must confront it by advancing housing solutions and creating more homes with a focus on affordability.\u201d\nThe rezoning creates two new high-density residential\ndistricts\nthat require Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and also allow for the construction of housing projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. This is the first time that these new districts have been used, after the state lifted the city\u2019s long-standing cap on residential floor area ratio of 12.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unlocking a pent-up demand for residential use, both new residential buildings and conversion of existing office buildings,\u201d said Jeff Mulligan, Planning and Development Specialist at the law firm HSF Kramer.\nThe new districts were made possible by\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 rezoning initiative that passed last December, which enables greater residential density across the city. The units created through this Midtown rezoning are part of Eric Adams\u2019\nManhattan Plan\n, which promises 100,000 new units in the borough over the next decade.\n\u201cThis is what addressing the housing crisis means, actually producing huge amounts of affordable housing,\u201d said local Council member Erik Bottcher.\n\nThe rezoning affects four separate areas of Midtown South, bounded by 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Eighth Avenue to the west. The areas were previously zoned for manufacturing use, and either barred housing construction or limited it considerably.\nIt also includes $325 million in planned upgrades along 21 blocks of Broadway, including a car-free busway on 34th Street, and the Adams administration pledged $121.9 million for programs dedicated to helping decades-old garment businesses in the area.\n\u201cTo get to a place where we can save and invest in the fashion industry, expand our transportation options, address the commercial vacancy crisis and address all the different hurdles, utilize new state allowances to build more density in places like Midtown, to me that is a success,\u201d said Council member Keith Powers.\nThe approval comes after the City Council\u2019s Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises\ntweaked\nthe original proposal last week. The redevelopment will now net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 affordable, down from the 9,676 units initially expected, of which 2,890 would be affordable.\nAmong other changes, City Council lowered the allowable residential density in a four-block area in the southeast section of the rezoning, between 23rd and 27th streets, reducing the maximum FAR from 18 to 15. It also scrapped a proposed high-density residential designation for a midblock stretch between West 36th and 40th streets, from Seventh to Eighth avenues, following concern from local businesses in the garment district that they would be forced out to make way for new development.\nThe success of this rezoning initiative is a major win for City of Yes, and may help pave the way for future rezonings in other high-density areas. The proposal now goes to the Mayor\u2019s office for final review and approval.\n",

        "content": "Swerdlow Group bought a nearly 2-acre development site in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood for $11.5 million.\nThe property will be part of Swerdlow\u2019s planned 5,000-plus unit affordable and workforce multifamily redevelopment of several public housing complexes in\nLittle River\n.\nMichael Swerdlow\u2019s\nCoconut Grove-based firm bought the property at 7275 and 7373 Northwest Seventh Avenue in Miami, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. An affiliate of roofing supply company ABC Supply sold the site.\nThe property consists of a 33,700-square-foot warehouse built in 1982, as well as six vacant lots, records show. It\u2019s adjacent to an inactive FEC Railway spur and to the 150-unit Victory Homes public housing complex at 520 Northwest 75th Street.\nSwerdlow plans to develop\n5,730 below-market rentals\n; 370,000 square feet of commercial space; 250,000 square feet of open space and amenities; and a new Tri-Rail passenger train station across five existing Miami-Dade County public housing complexes in Little River. SJM Partners and Alben Duffie are development partners.\nIn addition to Victory Homes, the complexes Swerdlow will redevelop are Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court; Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court; Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court; and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue. They have a combined 314 units.\n\nIn April, county commissioners approved for Swerdlow to redevelop the properties and lease the county-owned sites under a\n99-year term\n. The lease will yield $9.6 billion to Miami-Dade over the 99-year term.\nMiami-Dade records show that the 7275 and 7373 Northwest Seventh Avenue property Swerdlow just purchased, called the ABC Property, is part of the development site.\nCurrent residents at the public housing communities will be able to move into the new buildings Swerdlow develops. The firm will replace the existing 314 units through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Rental Assistance Demonstration program.\nOther units at the project could be apartments for rent or for-sale homes, county records show.\nSwerdlow\u2019s Little River project is part of a bigger Miami-Dade initiative to redevelop its aging public housing. In 2023, the county issued a solicitation to redevelop a total of 10 low-income housing complexes.\nElsewhere in Miami-Dade, Miami Beach-based Redwood Dev Co plans to replace a portion of Annie Coleman 14 public housing site at 2415-2479 and 2494 Northwest 50th Street and 2600 Northwest 48th Street\u00a0 with\n287 affordable units\n, 36 townhouses and 4,800 square feet of retail. Annie Coleman 14 is in an unincorporated area of the county. Redwood also plans to redevelop the Gwen Cherry 07 public housing complex with 150 affordable units reserved for renters 62 and older, and the Lemon City public housing complex with 260 affordable apartments. The properties are at 170 Northeast 67th Street, 6850 and 6860 Northeast Second Avenue, and 185, 147 and 137 Northeast 68th Terrace in Miami.\n",

The six-acre property at 10950 Washington Boulevard has been empty since the NFL\u2019s media operations\nrelocated to Hollywood Park\nnear SoFi Stadium in Inglewood four years ago.\nHudson is looking to turn part of the property into a mixed-use development with housing and commercial uses, according to Urbanize. NFL Media\nterminated its lease\nat the site in 2022.\nUnder the proposal, Hudson would redevelop two five-story buildings to include a total of 508 apartments, 14,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, and parking for 715 vehicles. The project, designed by KFA Architecture, would have more than 100,000 square feet of landscaped open space, including an approximately 10,000-square-foot publicly-accessible plaza along Washington Boulevard.\nDensity bonus incentives allow the developer to build larger than what would be normally allowed at the site, provided it sets aside 79 of the apartments as deed-restricted low-income housing. In Los Angeles County, low income is generally\ndefined\nas making less than $84,850 annually for one person.\nThe SoFi Stadium area is quickly becoming a sports media hub in the country\u2019s entertainment capital.\n\nBillionaire Stan Kroenke, owner of the Los Angeles Rams and SoFi Stadium, has filed plans to build\nHollywood Park Studios\nat the 300-acre Hollywood Park retail village in Inglewood.\nThe 12-acre studio project is designed to be the International Broadcast Center for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. After the global sporting event, the studios would be available for entertainment production and operations.\nThe first phase of that development calls for five soundstages at 18,000 square feet each. An accompanying three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building would house support, production and postproduction facilities.\n\u201cThe vision for Hollywood Park has always been to build a city within a city combining media, entertainment and technology that will transform the greater Los Angeles area,\u201d Kroenke said in a\nstatement\nof the endeavor.\nThe Culver City Planning Commission is set to review Hudson Pacific\u2019s plans later this month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A ULI panel is expected to present recommendations to the city council next month.\nThe DuPage County suburb has drawn developer interest recently for data centers and single-family homes.\nKaris is pitching a two-building\ndata center complex\non 40 acres at the long-vacant Alcatel\u2011Lucent office site near Naperville and Warrenville roads.

        "content": "Kingston\u2019s role as the Hudson Valley\u2019s rent-control test case may prove to be short-lived.\nA\nnew city vacancy study found rates in buildings covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act at 7.04 percent this spring, above the 5 percent limit required to declare a \u201chousing emergency\u201d and keep rent caps in place, the Times Union\nreported\n.\nThe results come\nless than two months\nafter New York\u2019s highest court upheld Kingston\u2019s ETPA program, a decision hailed by tenant advocates as a landmark win.\nThe Court of Appeals rejected a challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overstepped by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings. The ruling let that reduction stand and opened the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nNow, those same protections could shrink or disappear. The city\u2019s director of housing initiatives, Bartek Starodaj, will present the findings to the Common Council\u2019s Laws and Rules Committee next week.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments; exemptions and rehab projects have cut that to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nThe 2025 survey differed in its approach, using a \u201ctargeted sampling\u201d that excluded some large complexes like 267-unit Stony Run, which is still under ETPA after a recent state ruling.\n\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units, where vacancies are 3.73 percent \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum.\nAssemblymember Sarahana Shrestha slammed the process as \u201cabsolute nonsense,\u201d saying the 5 percent vacancy trigger fails to capture actual housing strain.\nMedian home prices in Ulster County have tripled since 2016 to $421,800, median rents have doubled to $2,000 and more than half of Kingston renters are cost-burdened.\nThe city has over 600 units in its pipeline \u2014 the most since the 1970s \u2014 and has rolled out rezoning, short-term rental caps and \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction to protect tenants, but Mayor Steve Noble says housing remains \u201ca very challenging issue.\u201d\nThe Common Council\u2019s call on whether to keep, tweak or scrap rent stabilization will be closely watched by lawmakers and activists pushing to scrap the vacancy requirement for small cities adopting ETPA.\nIf Kingston backs off, it could mark the first rollback of rent stabilization in New York.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A superior court judge in Los Angeles County ruled Tuesday that Beverly Hills violated state housing law in its attempt to block Leo Pustilnikov\u2019s proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant.\nat 125-129 South Linden Drive. The city will now have to allow the application for the project at 125-129 S. Linden Drive to proceed. The ruling seems likely to affect other housing projects\u00a0 that have been proposed in recent years under California\u2019s Builder\u2019s Remedy law but held up by the city.\n\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how validating it is,\u201d said Dave Rand, an attorney at Rand Pastor Nelson who represented Pustilnikov in the case that\u2019s been playing out in court since last year.\n\u201cA lot of these legal questions \u2014 they\u2019re new,\u201d Rand said. \u201cThis puts the wind at our back and sends a message clear as day. The city cannot rely on specious legal arguments to delay and deny a developer\u2019s vested rights.\u201d\nPustilnikov did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Richards Watson and Gershon\u2019s Ginetta Giovinco, who represented Beverly Hills in the litigation, did not immediately return a phone call from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Linden Drive project was one of the first proposals in Beverly Hills to exploit the legal loophole that lets builders override local planning boards when cities fail to plan for new housing as required by state law.\nState lawmakers recently enabled such standoffs by reviving the 1980s-era provision known as Builder\u2019s Remedy with a series of reforms chiseling away at the discretionary power of cities to block housing. California\u2019s 2019 Housing Crisis Act and subsequent Permit Streamlining Act both came into play in Pustilnikov\u2019s legal battle.\nThe drama began when the Ukrainian-born developer proposed replacing a five-story office building near the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards with a tower with 165 apartments and a 73-key boutique hotel.\nThe 2022 planning application hit tony Beverly Hills like a wrecking ball \u2014 and\u00a0 more soon followed.\nThe city has tried several tactics to regain control over the spate of Builder\u2019s Remedy projects. City planners, for example, rejected Pustilnikov\u2019s application and others like it on the grounds that the proposals changed too much during the review process or didn\u2019t qualify as housing projects due to mixed-use components, among other arguments.\n\n\u201cThese cases all involve the same basic questions,\u201d said Californians for Homeownership\u2019s Matt Gelfand, one of numerous lawyers involved in the yearslong effort to force Beverly Hills to follow state housing law.\nThe nonprofit firm, which is funded by the California Association of Realtors, and the California Housing Defense Fund, have both filed their own cases against the City of Beverly Hills.\nSuperior Court Judge Curtis Kin rejected all of the city\u2019s arguments in the case, but stopped short of ruling that Beverly Hills acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d which requires a higher legal bar, according to the Aug. 12 court filing.\nThe city\u2019s lawyers invoked standards that do not exist in the law and illegally subject developers to the \u201cwhims and caprice of the city,\u201d the ruling says.\n\u201cThe court is unconvinced by the city\u2019s claim that the petitions should be denied,\u201d Kin wrote.\nHe ordered Beverly Hills to reverse its previous denials of Pustilnikov\u2019s application and continue reviewing the project\u2019s plans.\nThis week\u2019s decision means that years of work will finally bear fruit, Gelfand told\nTRD\n.\nHe added that Beverly Hills may need to return to drawing board to come up with new arguments in similar cases pending over Max Netty\u2019s\n27-unit condo proposal\nat 140 South Camden Drive and a 134-unit building proposed for 8820 and 8800 Wilshire Boulevard, not to mention\nnumerous other Builder\u2019s Remedy proposals currently pending\nwith the city.\nNetty\u2019s lawyer, Holland and Knight\u2019s Ryan Leaderman, for his part agreed.\n\u201cThis is super easy,\u201d Leaderman told\nTRD\n. \u201cThe city\u2019s argument is that due to a change in the project, you have lost your vested rights to proceed as a builder\u2019s remedy project. We call \u2018b-s\u2019 on that.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A\nBeverly Hills\nproperty once owned by developer\nRick Caruso\nhas traded hands for $47.5 million.\nThe sale of the seven-bed, 15-bath home at 912 Benedict Canyon Drive was inked in late July and recorded with Los Angeles County this week.\nBeverly Hills-based Westside Estate Agency double ended the deal with Fred Bernstein and Ethan Peskowitz the listing agents. Meanwhile, WEA co-founder Kurt Rappaport represented the buyer.\nThe brokerage declined to comment on the deal.\nThe recently redone property first hit the market in 2023 for $72.5 million and was most recently listed in January for $56.9 million, according to listing sites.\nProperty records show the seller is a Delaware-registered limited liability company called RFG-Lavender, while the buyer is an entity called Murray Hill Real Estate LLC.\nRFG bought the home from Caruso in 2018, paying $16.7 million for it in late 2018.\n\nThe developer behind Americana at Brand and The Grove perhaps wouldn\u2019t recognize the new version from his prior residence. Caruso\u2019s former Traditional-style home counted one less bedroom and four fewer bathrooms than the contemporary abode that just traded, according to a comparison of the listings.\nComing in at over 17,000 square feet, the property has a 130-foot-long driveway, six-car garage, elevator, library and theater. The primary suite alone is 2,000 square feet with its own living room and 900-square-foot balcony.\nThe spread continues outside where there\u2019s a cabana, kitchen, pool, spa and tennis court. It\u2019s also less than a 10-minute walk away from the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard.\nThe Benedict Canyon Drive property is the third-largest on-market trade by closing price in Beverly Hills so far this year, according to records with Zillow.\nLeading the pack is\n1028 Ridgedale Drive\n, which went for $60 million in April. Rappaport represented the clients on the sell and buy side of the deal, with Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton co-listing the 12-bed, 18-bath estate.\nThe city\u2019s second-largest deal was\n942 North Alpine Drive\n, which traded for $51.8 million, also in April. The over 12,000-square-foot residence was listed by Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Carolwood\u2019s Linda May. Compass\u2019 Carl Gambino and John Bercsi represented the buyer.\n",

The price works out to $380,000 per unit.\nAbacus bought the property from Walnut Creek-based Sequoia Equities, which acquired the complex in 2018 for $117 million. At the time of that acquisition, Sequoia Equities general partner Pat Reilly said it would invest $2.5 million to modernize the apartments and shared amenities, according to Urbanize. It financed the 2018 purchase with a seven-year, $74.3 million loan originated by Walker &amp; Dunlop, which was scheduled to mature this month.\nAbacus\u2019 purchase marks the latest\nEast Bay multifamily\nproperty sold for a discount to its previous price. Earlier this year, 1889 Harrison Street and 447 17th Street in Oakland sold for roughly half their assessed values; in March, an apartment building at 2055 Center Street in Berkeley traded hands for about 40 percent of its assessed value.\n\nAbacus has been growing its presence in the Bay Area over the past year. The real estate investment firm bought the 80-unit Valencia and 64-unit Valencia Terrace apartment buildings in Vallejo last year for $27.5 million. The firm specializes in multifamily investments across the U.S. with more than $4.8 billion in investments and boasts more than 31,000 units in its portfolio.\nMeanwhile, apartment development in the Bay Area has sunk to a 15-year low, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing CoStar Group.\nSouth San Francisco\nis bucking that regional trend with three large-scale residential projects underway.\nTrammell Crow Residential recently secured a $183 million construction loan for its 480-unit Alexan Icon project at 1587 and 1588 San Mateo Avenue.

The building is near restaurants and nightlife, and it\u2019s less than half a mile from Klyde Warren Park.\nAll of that fits into the REIT\u2019s \u201clifestyle Sun Belt office strategy,\u201d Kennedy Hicks, Cousins executive vice president, told the outlet.\nMore acquisitions are yet to come. The firm\u2019s \u201ccore strategy\u201d involves identifying similar assets to purchase across the Sun Belt, she said.\nThe firm\u2019s priority is to invest in cities where it already owns properties, such as\nCharlotte\n, Dallas, Nashville, Phoenix and Tampa, and expand those portfolios, Cousins CEO Colin Connolly said.\n\nThe Link at Uptown opened in 2021 and is 94 percent leased. Out of the 292,000-square-foot building only about 6,200 square feet of space is available. JLL is handling leasing.\nDallas-based developer Kaizen Development Partners sold the building and was its developer.\nThis was Cousins\u2019 second play in the urban core of Dallas. Last fall, it paid $138 million to buy the mortgage for\nSaint Ann Court\n, an Uptown Dallas office building at 2501 North Harwood.\nElsewhere in Dallas-Fort Worth, Cousins owns a nine-story office building at 5950 Sherry Lane, a nine-story office tower in Preston Center near Sterling Plaza, and Legacy Union, a 319,000-square-foot office building in Plano.\nCousins was founded as a construction business by Tom Cousins in 1958, and it developed several iconic buildings in Atlanta\u2019s skyline.

        "content": "A co-op once owned by the late socialite Lee Radziwill hit the market asking just under $17 million.\nThe duplex at 969 Fifth Avenue last traded more than two decades ago, when Suzanne von Liebig, the wife of the late inventor and philanthropist William von Liebig, purchased it for $7.6 million, according to the listing broker, Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group.\nVon Liebig renovated the apartment, which spans the fifth and sixth floors of the building between East 77th and East 78th streets, before moving in in early 2004. Modlin said she has \u201cmaintained it at a high level,\u201d including painting the property and redoing the floors before listing it.\nModlin called the co-op a \u201crare gem,\u201d with every room in the apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue, Central Park or the James B. Duke Mansion, a townhouse commissioned by the tobacco heir for his wife in the early 20th century.\n\nThe 4,600-square-foot home, which was featured in\nArchitectural Digest\nin 1975, has three bedrooms and four bathrooms and features a wood-paneled library, eat-in kitchen and a private elevator. It\u2019s one of 12 units in the pre-war building, which includes private storage and full-time doormen.\nBorn Caroline Lee Radziwill, the younger sister of Jackie Onassis was an interior designer, socialite and public relations executive known for her friendships with artist Andy Warhol, writer Truman Capote, members of the Rolling Stones and designer Giorgio Armani. She was married three times, to publishing executive Michael Temple Canfield, the Polish Prince Stanislaw Radziwill and filmmaker Herbert Ross.\nRadziwill owned homes across Manhattan, London and Paris, including another Upper East Side apartment. In 2019, about eight months after her death, her 15th-floor co-op on East 72nd Street sold for\n$4.25 million\n.\nOther units in the building have traded for more modest sums, at least in the years since the city began recording deals in its online database. One co-op on the 11th and 12th floors broke with the norm in 2008, when it sold for more than $16 million. The apartment hit the market four years later with an asking price of roughly $26 million, where it endured multiple price cuts and languished for more than a decade. It sold last year for $6.5 million in what appears to be a transfer between family members for half the value of the apartment.\nA duplex on the first and second floors sold last year for $3 million. The three-bedroom apartment belonged to the late architect Henry Cobb, known for designing the Goldman Sachs headquarters in Battery Park City, who lived there with his late wife, sculptor Joan Cobb, starting in the 1960s until their deaths in 2020 and 2022, respectively.\n",

The unit measures just over 4,500 interior square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Corcoran\u2019s\nHilary Landis\nand\nBeth Benalloul\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe Big Apple\u2019s top commercial deal recorded was in Brooklyn. A commercial condo at the Triangle Junction mall at\n1600 Flatbush Avenue\nchanged hands for $41 million.

The buildings, at\n269 Washington Avenue\nand\n238 Hall Street\nin Clinton Hill are around the corner from each other and have 10 units each. They were built in 2016. At the Hall Street property, the asking rent for a two-bedroom apartment that went off the market in July was $4,650. At the Washington Avenue building, a three-bedroom unit was listed for $6,400 in July.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nExtell\nnotched another sale at\n50 West 66th Street. Andrew and Stacey Feller\ndropped $11.7 million on a 3,900-square-foot, five-bedroom pad at the luxury tower. The deal works out to roughly $3,000 per square foot.\nLandis\nand\nBenalloul\n, with Corcoran, again had the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Frederic and Melissa Dassori\nscooped up a townhouse at\n131 East 95th Street\non Carnegie Hill for $9.5 million, above its asking price of just under $9 million. The sellers were\nGeorge and Leslie Biddle\n, who bought the home in 2010 for $3.5 million. The five-story property dates to 1910 and spans 5,300 square feet. It has four bedrooms, a garden and a built-in barbecue area. The home went on the market in March with\nLandis, Benalloul\nand\nCaroline Shalloe\n, all with Corcoran.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nForeclosures surge across U.S. cities\nForeclosure filings last month were 13 percent higher than they were at the same time last year, according to a report from real estate data firm Attom. Overall, there were more than 36,000 such filings, which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions. That means one in every 3,939 housing units had such a filing.\nAmong the most populous metropolitan areas in the U.S., three-quarters saw their foreclosure filings surge year over year, and just 14 of these regions saw foreclosure activity drop during this time. (\nThe Real Dea\nl analyzed Attom\u2019s foreclosure data for the 56 cities that have populations of at least 1 million residents.)\nNew York, the country\u2019s largest metro area, experienced a decline of about 16 percent in foreclosure activity compared to the year before.

        "content": "If the game show \u201cFamily Feud\u201d asked contestants to name \u201cthings that scare people,\u201d they might say horror movies, spiders and the dark.\nBut in progressive neighborhoods of New York City, \u201cmarket-rate condos\u201d would make the list.\nMany debates over whether to rezone for mixed-income multifamily boil down to, \u201cWell, if we do nothing, they\u2019ll build market-rate condos\u201d \u2014 \u201cluxury units\u201d that \u201cnobody can afford\u201d and would \u201cprice out\u201d longtime residents. A true boogeyman.\nUsually a deal is reached for a mix of market-rate and affordable rentals, and people move on with their lives.\nBut sometimes, negotiations fail and a developer does, in fact, build market-rate condos. Such was the case last decade when then-Council member Brad Lander and\nFortis Property Group\ncouldn\u2019t come to terms on a\nCobble Hill project\n.\nNow it is happening again at a Crown Heights site where a Bruce Eichner rental project was rejected for fear of gentrification and shadows. The offering plan for Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s condominium at 960 Franklin Avenue, as\nTRD\n\u2019s\nSheridan Wall\nreported\n, prices units at more than $1,200 per square foot. The cheapest is $600,000.\nThe development\u2019s 300 apartments will all be one or two bedrooms. That\u2019s another thing politicians don\u2019t like: projects that don\u2019t have units for \u201cfamilies\u201d (even though three-bedrooms are often rented to roommates).\nBut guess what? A boogeyman is defined as \u201c\na monstrous imaginary figure\n\u201d invoked to scare children. Adults in Crown Heights should not be afraid of Schwartz\u2019s modest-sized, market-rate condos.\nThe building is filling a former factory site and won\u2019t displace anyone, directly or indirectly.

While the missed funding pales in comparison to what the state spends on Medicaid (a projected $109.6 billion this fiscal year), the news comes as New York faces broader federal funding cuts.\n\u2014 Animal-rights activists rallied outside Thursday\u2019s City Council meeting following the death of a Central Park carriage horse named Lady,\namNY\nreported.

        "content": "Suffolk lawmakers are moving to yank public funds from landlords whose Department of Social Services-backed rentals flout building or zoning codes.\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Legis. Nick Caracappa and James Mazzarella, would expand existing rules that already allow the county to withhold assistance if a property is \u201cdangerous, hazardous or detrimental to life or health.\u201d The added language would also cover any rental that fails to comply with municipal zoning or building standards, Newsday\nreported\n.\nBackers frame it as a quality-of-life fix in hot spots like Mastic Beach and Coram, pointing to egregious cases, such as makeshift kitchens with Charbroil grills, chopped-up interiors and wastewater systems buckling under excess tenants. The legislation would require municipalities to inspect homes before DSS placements, forcing landlords to bring properties up to code before collecting rent checks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting people\u2019s lives in jeopardy and we\u2019re aware of it,\u201d Caracappa said, adding the aim is to dismantle a \u201cbusiness model\u201d that lets owners reap county rent while barring inspectors from entry.\nOpponents warn the measure could backfire, shrinking an already scarce pool of units for DSS clients and overloading local code enforcement. Greta Guarton of the Long Island Coalition for the Homeless argued zoning rules don\u2019t necessarily impact health or safety, and the county should focus on adding affordable housing rather than cutting existing stock.\n\nWelfare to Work Commission chair Richard Koubek added that requiring inspections for every placement could \u201cderail\u201d the department\u2019s ability to house clients.\nCaracappa insists the county would start with \u201cmost egregious\u201d properties to avoid mass displacement. The bill had its second public hearing last week and is slated for committee review later this month.\nBetween January and May 2024, Suffolk placed nearly 500 homeless families and more than 600 single adults in emergency housing. There is $85 million budgeted for a \u201cSafety Net\u201d program, but it\u2019s unclear how much the county actually spends on DSS placements.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Moshe Wechsler has been granted a reprieve from debt payments on a massive Chicago multifamily loan.\nFannie Mae has struck a forbearance agreement with Wechsler\u2019s New York-based firm Emerald Empire on at least $125 million worth of loans attached to Chicago apartment properties. The rental buildings were sold by Chicago-based Pangea Properties in a huge real estate trade nearly three years ago. The deal made Emerald one of the city\u2019s largest landlords overnight and constituted one of the priciest multifamily transactions in Chicago history, if not the city\u2019s outright biggest deal in the sector.\nThe transaction involved about 7,500 housing units spread across more than 400 buildings, with a total price tag of about $600 million.\nNow, however, at least some of the debt has required the borrower to ask for a pause on payments.\n\u201cThe loans in question are currently in forbearance and are performing in accordance with the agreement,\u201d a Fannie Mae spokesperson said.\nThe properties in forbearance are encumbered by a tranche of debt within a bigger $430 million financing package, according to public records. Emerald borrowed the money from a group led by Arbor Realty Trust affiliates, according to Cook County documents. Lender NewPoint Real Estate Capital also participated in the financing before the debt was sold off to Fannie, the government-sponsored agency.\n\nAt the time the deal closed, Arbor described it as one of the largest Fannie Mae Structured Adjustable-Rate Mortgage loans of 2022; because its interest rate is adjustable, the costs of debt service have likely risen from when the deal was originated, since the Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate over the course of 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the $125 million tranche is the only portion of the package that has entered forbearance for now, or whether additional sections of the mortgage debt are also going without payment from the borrower.\nWechsler and Emerald Empire didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nThe forbearance agreement is a sign that Emerald Empire is working to get its operations in order to catch up on the loan. But it\u2019s unknown why the firm sought to enter forbearance. The mortgages aren\u2019t scheduled to mature until Jan. 1, 2033, public records show.\nCity officials have taken issue with the conditions of multiple properties within the portfolio, though. There\u2019s a handful of properties Emerald owns that are currently making their way through the city\u2019s housing court for building code violations. The landlord has been ordered to pay fines to the city at multiple properties for issues such as maintenance of rat abatement measures. Emerald has incurred multiple fines of $500 or more from city code violations at numerous properties, public records show.\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the allegedly poor property conditions are a factor in the forbearance agreement.",

The asking price amounts to $1,073 per square foot.\nThe six-bedroom main house has six-and-a-half bathrooms, a great room with custom woodwork, lower-level recreation room and a first-floor office. A two-bedroom coach house has a full bathroom and kitchen.\nThe estate is geared toward equestrian enthusiasts with a lighted, fenced-in riding area and stables.

The property also features a tennis court, hot tub and walking paths.\n\nIt can be subdivided, according to Burr Ridge village guidelines.\nOwner Jacqueline Laase Portillo and her former husband Beau Parrillo bought the mansion in 2002 for $1.65 million on roughly 4 acres and added an adjoining three acres in 2007 for $1.8 million.\nThe highest sale in Burr Ridge was recorded in 2022. Carmela Wallace, mother of the late rapper Juice WRLD, paid $6.9 million for a six-bedroom, 17,000-square-foot home at 6679 Lee Court.\nWallace\nalso purchased two acres next door to the mansion for $1.4 million at the same time, for a combined $8.3 million.

The real estate investment trust couldn\u2019t secure refinancing before a two-month forbearance period expired. Appraisals are in process, and Ashford requested additional time to prepare an exit strategy, according to special servicer Trimont Real Estate Advisors.\nThe portfolio, comprising 18 hotels in 13 states, has a balance of $590 million. A plurality of the properties are in Texas: the Hilton Garden Inn at 500 N I-35, Austin; the Marriott DFW Airport North at 8440 Freeport Parkway, Irving; the Sugar Land Marriott at 16090 City Walk, Sugar Land; and the Marriott Plaza at 555 South Alamo Street, San Antonio.\nNeither Ashford nor Trimont responded for comment.\nOccupancy in the hotels over a twelve-month period was down to 56 percent as of March 31. At the end of 2024, the portfolio\u2019s occupancy rate was 68 percent, following a peak of 70 percent in 2023. The portfolio\u2019s most difficult year was 2020, when occupancy reached a low of 33 percent.\nThat\u2019s when trouble for the loan began. Ashford\u2019s recent performance history is generally current through August 2024, but the loan\u2019s original maturity date was in April 2020, the same month Ashford requested immediate transfer to special servicing for the first time. It was returned to the master servicer \u2014 Wells Fargo \u2014 in April 2021.\nLast February, Ashford extended its maturity date for the fifth and final time. It\u2019s been on the watchlist for its final maturity date since October 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Bennett\u2019s assets have faced distress. A\ndifferent loan\nwent to special servicing first in April 2020 and again in 2024.\nTwo of the company\u2019s hotels landed in foreclosure last year\n.

The loan had been granted a two-month forbearance to finalize refinancing, but it appears the deadline was not met. The portfolio, backed by 18 hotel properties across the U.S., reported a\u00a0 2024 NCF that was 22% lower than the issuance level due to lower-than-anticipated revenue.\nServicer commentary: July 1 2025\nBorrower was unable to close on a refinance before the expiration of a 60 days forbearance period and the loan was transferred to Special Servicing due to Balloon Payment/Maturity Default.The borrower has requested additional time to work on an exit \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 strategy and the SS is reviewing.

Occupancy has consistently stayed above 92 percent since 2018, significantly outperforming the rest of the submarket, which had a 16.7 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which has the listing.\nMost of the building\u2019s leases extend into 2028 and beyond, providing long-term income stability. The building\u2019s competitive rent pricing \u2014 about $27 per square foot compared to $32 in the surrounding micro-market \u2014 has helped drive consistent leasing success.\n\u201cThere\u2019s substantial room for a new owner to push rents while maintaining tenant demand,\u201d Cushman\u2019s Matt Murphy said.\nThe property\u2019s walkability is another draw, with nearby access to restaurants and retailers such as Starbucks, Trader Joe\u2019s and Fire Bowl Cafe.\n\nThe asking price is undisclosed. Its taxable value is $17 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nTenants include tech companies Keyence and SourceDay and gaming company Panic Button.\nBuilt in 1984, the building is also bucking the trend for older office buildings, which generally have performed poorly since the pandemic. Office tenants prefer new, amenity filled office buildings in vibrant areas. But location is a big part of the sales pitch.\nThe area has become \u201cthe unofficial technology hub with the\nDomain\nand Arboretum as the two most walkable mixed-use destinations north of the river,\u201d Franklin Street\u2019s Ryan Bohls told the outlet.\nThe world\u2019s most-profitable company,\nNvidia\n, is poised to significantly expand its Austin presence with a lease at the One Uptown office tower near the Domain, adding to the influx of tech offices. Meanwhile, leasing is sluggish in\nDowntown Austin\n.\n",

        "content": "The Breakers is planning an eight-story, 155-unit apartment complex in West Palm Beach to house its workers.\nThe iconic Palm Beach hotel has seen the writing on the wall about the lack of affordability in Palm Beach County, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported. City officials are calling it the first employer housing development of its kind in the county, another marker of the region\u2019s rapid change in recent years.\nThe building is planned for the 2.5-acre site at 2410, 2460 and 2058 North Australian Avenue, which a Breakers affiliate bought for $2.3 million in December, according to property records. Plans include a pool, sports field and shuttle services, the Post reported. The design team includes West Palm Beach-based Spina O\u2019Rourke &amp; Partners and Tyler Woolsey of Urban Design Studio.\nThe\nWest Palm Beach\nPlanning Board unanimously approved the project at its July meeting, but the project still requires final approval from the West Palm Beach City Commission.\n\n\u201cI love that they\u2019re creating a place for their employees to live, especially given the unaffordability of workers\u2019 housing in West Palm Beach,\u201d board member Will Corrente said at the July meeting.\nEmployment with\nthe Breakers\nwill be a requirement to live in the complex, which will primarily serve the hotel\u2019s temporary workforce.\nThe hotel was founded in 1896 by Henry Flagler and is owned by the\nheirs\nof his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, through the entity Flagler Systems. With more than 2,400 employees, it is one of the largest employers in Palm Beach County. The hotel relies on hundreds of foreign workers, and was last year approved to hire 249 workers with H2-B visas, the Post reported.\nThe Breakers has been adjusting to Palm Beach\u2019s growth in recent years. In December, the hotel bought the former Palm Beach Post Office from billionaire Jeff Greene for\n$28 million\n.\n\u2014\nKate Hinsche",

The price is over $8 million per acre. The seller was the U.S. General Services Administration, the federal government\u2019s real estate arm.\nPresidio Bay\u2019s plans for the site are yet to be determined, beyond it being mixed-use. The firm is working with city officials and will hold community meetings to figure out the best way to redevelop it. The campus could accommodate 600 to 1,000 units of housing and 600,000 to 800,000 square feet of commercial space, the outlet said.\nThe city of Menlo Park is on the hook to permit nearly 3,000 new units of housing before 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n.\nThe sale was part of the Trump Administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency\ncuts\n, as agencies shrunk their headcount and reduced the need for office space across the country. In selling the Rockaway Grove property, the federal government is expected to save taxpayers $107 million in deferred maintenance and about $4 million in annual maintenance costs, the GSA told the outlet.\n\n\u201cThis sale demonstrates our commitment to reducing the federal footprint while better serving our customer\u2019s needs,\u201d Mike Rigas, acting administrator for the GSA, said in a\nstatement\n.\nPresidio Bay is the developer behind the Springline mixed-use development in Menlo Park, one of the first major post-pandemic developments in the Bay Area. That property includes 183 apartments, 200,000 square feet of office space and various restaurant tenants.\nPresidio Bay will begin hosting monthly community meetings at Springline starting this month as the developer prepares to submit a formal project application to redevelop the Rockaway Grove site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Development is risky and complicated. It involves lots of decisions, and bad ones can be catastrophic.\nFor megaprojects, everything is multiplied. They are enormously challenging even for the smartest and most experienced developers.\nThe worst way to execute a megaproject would be to hand decision-making authority to more than two dozen people, each representing different constituencies with divergent and sometimes conflicting goals \u2014 and little or no real estate experience.\nTo make it even harder, you would have politicians lead this\n28-member group\nand require a two-thirds majority vote to approve a master plan.\nYou would include three levels of government, a community board, local residents, environmental justice advocates, planning organizations, labor unions, industry groups and public housing tenants.\nYou would install a\nsocialist\nas a vice chair. For good measure, you would tack on six advisory groups, each with its own agenda.\nAs a final complication, you\u2019d transfer the property to a local development corporation of city, state and federal officials, plus local residents, that must approve every RFP and contract \u2014 and have enforcement authority.\nWelcome, friends, to the Brooklyn Marine Terminal.\nThe $3.5 billion, 122-acre project would build 6,000 homes (40 percent of them affordable), modernize an aging, money-losing port, and completely reimagine a huge chunk of long-neglected waterfront.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why votes on the project have been\nrepeatedly\ncanceled\nfor lack of consensus, see above.\nYet the process has its defenders.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good model,\u201d said Sen. Andrew Gounardes, \u201cbut it can get a little messy.\u201d\nGournardes, the non-socialist vice chair of the 28-member task force, no doubt feels like he\u2019s herding cats as he tries to get at least 19 of them to agree on something.\n\u201cThere are voices that want nothing to happen here,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey say they want to protect the port, but they don\u2019t want to see any construction, investment, trucks, noise, anything. They are using the cover of the port to prevent anything from happening here.\u201d\nOthers do want something to happen, but disagree on what.\n\n\u201cThere are voices in the community who want to keep the entire site industrial,\u201d Gounardes said. \u201cThere are voices on the same block who hate the port and want open space across the waterfront. There are some people who say, \u2018Put housing there.\u2019 There is not one unified vision of what this site could be or should be.\u201d\nLike he said, it can get a little messy.\n\u201cThere is not one unified vision of what this site could be or should be.\u201d\nSen. Andrew Gounardes\nThe massive undertaking,\nannounced in May 2024\n, is going through a state process called a General Project Plan. But the Hochul administration is deferring to the city, making the Economic Development Corporation, led by Andrew Kimball, the lead agency.\nIn fairness to EDC, it is trying to avoid the outcomes of other models for megaprojects involving public land. Atlantic Yards, which is now Pacific Park, is half-built, in\nforeclosure\nand on its\nthird developer\n\u2014 22 years after it was announced.\nBut at least something has been built there. The same cannot be said for\nSunnyside Yard\n, where the de Blasio administration put together a steering committee like the one at Brooklyn Marine Terminal. It was dysfunctional from the outset, with members demanding a financially impossible amount of affordable housing.\nThey even\npushed their own hero\n, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, off the committee when she tried to reason with them. Eleven years of planning has come to nothing.\nThe Brooklyn Marine Terminal task force, in contrast, has lots of members who want to get to yes, Gounardes said. It looks like they are close to a compromise on a master plan that is one-third port, one-third housing and one-third open space. Port renovations will cost about\n$1.7 billion\n.\nThere is still a lot of posturing. For example, Council member Shahana Hanif is demanding the project include \u201creal displacement protections for rent-regulated tenants and small businesses,\u201d even though it is not removing a single home or store, and rent-regulated tenants are already the most protected renters in the nation.\nHanif, socialist vice chair Alexa Avil\u00e9s and other progressives have whittled the number of market-rate homes down to the bare minimum needed to yield $1.3 billion for the port, which will also get $360 million from a federal grant \u2014 unless the Trump administration cancels it while the task force bickers.\nIf this were not public land, politics were not an issue and no constituencies needed to be pacified, a developer could build more than 10,000 market-rate homes with spectacular views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and the Lower Manhattan skyline.\nThat would generate enough profit to subsidize thousands of affordable units, ample green space and esplanades, a ferry stop and shuttle buses to the nearest subway stations.\nBut in the real world, that is just as far-fetched as the Sunnyside Yard fantasies.\nThe Brooklyn Marine Terminal project will get done under this incredibly convoluted model \u2014 or it won\u2019t get done at all.\n",

The property consists of a 38,200-square-foot, one-story building completed in 1979 on a 3.8-acre site.\nAnother entity also led by Herzka and tied to Emerald and Infinite Care bought the 100-bed Pinecrest Rehabilitation Center at 13650 Northeast Third Court in North Miami, according to records and Vizzda. The 30,400-square-foot, one-story building was completed in 1967 on a 2.4-acre site.\nFort Lauderdale-based NuVision Management, a consultancy for geriatric and pediatric long-term care and rehabilitative service providers, sold both properties, according to Vizzda records. The buyers obtained a $46.6 million Valley Bank loan, which is cross-collateralized across the North Miami and Tamarac properties, as well as other Emerald and Infinite Care properties.\n\nTamarac Rehabilitation provides skilled nursing and rehabilitation services to patients who have had strokes or broken bones, its website sites. Pinecrest Rehabilitation offers post-hospital care, skilled nursing and rehabilitation services for various conditions, including pneumonia, heart conditions, bone fractures, joint replacement, strokes, Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer-related diagnoses, according to its website.\nSouth Florida\u2019s senior care facilities have continued to trade sporadically, as they are slightly more resilient to macroeconomic conditions such as elevated interest rates and inflation. That\u2019s partly because the state is a magnet for retirees, ensuring continued demand for\nassisted living\n, memory care, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers.\nIn April, Welltower real estate investment trust bought the 220-bed assisted and independent living facility Oakmonte Village of Davie at 8201 Stirling Road in Davie for\n$34.3 million\n. In June, Garden Healthcare, led by Barry Braunstein and Samuel Feuer, paid\n$24 million\nfor the 66-acre Eastridge at Cutler Bay at 19301 Southwest 87th Avenue in Cutler Bay. The property offers independent and assisted living, skilled nursing, memory care and rehabilitation services.\nLeo Friedman, a senior living tycoon, bought the 472-unit Abbey Delray senior living facility at 2000 Lowson Boulevard in Delray Beach for\n$30 million\nin April.\n",

Conventional wisdom might indicate as much about a tech exec making real estate development policy the centerpiece of his campaign before he even settles on a party let alone a base of support to court in a territory that sprawls from a patch of the Westside through parts of Beverly Hills to Santa Monica.\nAnd don\u2019t expect any help figuring out Lucas through a lens of identity politics \u2014 he is openly struggling with his political identity.\nAt 6\u20194\u201d, with a beard and hair falling inches below his shoulders, he readily concedes he looks \u201ckinda \u2026\u00a0 like a hippie\u201d but cuts across that grain, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m young, but I wear a suit\u201d he says. \u201cI love America. I\u2019m trying a little bit to break people\u2019s brains.\u201d\nIndeed, the 32-year-old Glendale native hopes his lack of allegiance to any one party will sway enough voters to unseat two-term incumbent Democrat\nRick Chavez Zbur\n,\nwho crushed the Republican candidate in the last election.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to unfreeze a culture stuck in this Republican-Democrat thing for a long time,\u201d says the Boston College graduate, recent husband and first-time father-to-be.\nThat\u2019s where \u201clegalize building,\u201d comes into play.\nSure it\u2019s hyperbole, but could the audacious statement bring the right mix of cheek and world-weariness to unfreeze, unstick and unlock a seat in the California legislature?\nLucas stacks up a case behind his bold words:\n\u201cI think that the Dems in California, they\u2019re less open to change some of the ridiculous permitting process and all that,\u201d Lucas says over a medium spice half chicken plate at Cha Cha Chicken in Santa Monica on a recent afternoon. \u201cI think the Republicans are more like \u2014 cut the red tape. But the Democrats are more open to denser housing, whereas what I\u2019ve seen so far is the Republicans in California are not as open to it. I think they\u2019re much more pro single-family zoning.\u201d\nLucas leans toward density, but doesn\u2019t quibble with single-family housing \u2014 just make it fast, either way.\n\u201cThe fact that it takes more than two minutes to get approved for a permit is insane,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s have instant permits. This is a city level thing, but if you look at the number of permits issued during Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 tenure, it has cratered. I am pro-housing, pro-density. I\u2019m full-on YIMBY.\u201d\nIf that appeals to real estate professionals, consider Lucas\u2019 views of the Measure ULA property transfer tax on deals over $5.3 million \u2014 \u201cridiculous.\u201d Rent control? He\u2019s \u201ccompletely against\u201d it.\n\u201cBecause you look at where the money\u2019s going \u2014 the money is going to affordable housing projects, which is basically just lighting taxpayer dollars on fire,\u201d he says. \u201cVery few units actually get built. And I think the real solution here is legalize building. Let developers come in. Let the market figure it out.\u201d\n\nDevelopers, in particular, might warm even more to Lucas\u2019 view on the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\n, even after recent amendments that removed some longstanding barriers of multifamily projects.\n\u201cWe need a clean environment, but the problem is CEQA is weaponized,\u201d he says. It has become used as a way to just prevent projects from being built.\u201d\nHow to get from bold statements to the nomination of a political party to a seat in Sacramento?\nThat will take the same start-up mentality that Lucas used to grow his Santa Monica-based Fullsend Solutions, a software agency building web, iOS and Android applications, into a profitable business.\nIn a heavily \u201cblue\u201d district of around 500,000 people Lucas says he\u2019s likely to gin up interest from the Republican Party.\n\u201cI think the easiest way for me to get past the primary is to just say, OK, I\u2019m Republican, because I think I would have a really good shot of getting the second-most votes. Top two vote getters get past the primary to the general; it doesn\u2019t matter your party.\u201d\nThat might prove to be an early test of Lucas\u2019 math chops more than political skills. The 51st District has around 150,000 registered Democrats and about 20,000 registered Republicans. Four Democratic candidates could split their vote almost evenly and all do better than a Republican who got 100 of his party\u2019s members.\nA base of 20,000 is a start, though, and Lucas says he has made contact with Roxanne Hoge, chairperson of the Republican Party in L.A. County.\nWill he be able to run under the GOP banner even as he openly claims RINO (Republican in Name Only) status?\nLucas is hoping social media will help. He used it to kick off his campaign last month, putting his 23,600 followers on Instagram and 3,325 followers on X in the mix.\nHe hasn\u2019t raised any money, counts on his wife, who leads professional development sessions for teachers, as his campaign manager.\nOh, he\u2019s also a novice, with nothing beyond an elector victory for the presidency of his eight-grade class on his political resume.\nHe\u2019s undaunted so far.\n\u201cWe have, what, 10 months till the primary in June 2026,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking like a startup mentality. Like with as few resources as possible, and some videos and some ideas and just talking to people like you, how far can I go?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A pair of South Loop multifamily towers totaling 502 units just hit the market.\nReal estate giant Brookfield is selling a 411-unit building at 1255 South Michigan Avenue known as Sky55 as well as an affordable senior living building at 1251 South Michigan Avenue.\nBrookfield added the buildings to its portfolio through its $11.4 billion acquisition of Forest City Realty Trust in 2018. The bigger building was last refinanced for $96 million in 2020, with Prudential Multifamily Mortgage serving as the lender. The senior living building also obtained a $5.7 million loan from Prudential at the same time.\nThe listings, which are being marketed by CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Pete Marino, are hitting the market at a busy time.\nChicago has some of the strongest rent growth in the county, and a lack of developments in the pipeline suggests\nthat trajectory won\u2019t be changing any time soon.\n\nAt Sky55, market-rate units range from about $2,700 for a one bedroom to $3,700 for a two bedroom, two bathroom unit. Within the property, 30 percent of the units are set aside as affordable with rents ranging from $1,000 to $1,200. The building is 94 percent occupied.\nThe senior living property is made up of entirely affordable units, also with rents ranging from $1,000 to $1,200. The development was funded in part by federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits.\u00a0 Both properties include ground floor retail.\nWhile the properties are being pitched as value-add opportunities, some investors are hesitant to jump into the Chicago market. High interest rates coupled with an unpredictable property tax system and political environment have been causing the suburbs to outpace the city in multifamily sales.\nStill, momentum is gaining in the city. The State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio\nrecently listed a Streeterville apartment building\n, joining the pack of downtown apartments to hit the market recently.\nThat 481-unit property, the Streeter at 345 East Ohio Street, last sold 2007 for $210 million.",

        "content": "Worldwide Plaza\u2019s market value has cratered, wiping out the equity of its owners and threatening another body blow to Midtown\u2019s trophy office market.\nThe 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 825 Eighth Avenue was appraised at $345 million in April, an 80 percent drop from its $1.7 billion valuation in 2017, according to CMBS loan documents obtained by\nBisnow\n.\nSL Green and RXR acquired a roughly 49 percent stake in 2015, with the now-liquidating New York REIT holding the majority. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, plus $260 million in mezzanine financing.\nThe debt landed in special servicing in September after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated its 617,000-square-foot space for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant.\nDBRS Morningstar downgraded several CMBS classes last summer, citing the revenue hit and operating shortfalls that forced the special servicer to dip into reserves.\n\nA January loan modification freed more reserves to cover the gap, but that fix expired in July. SL Green and RXR are reportedly in talks for another workout to unlock the tens of millions needed to backfill space.\nThose plans may face a harsher reality if Nomura Holdings, the tower\u2019s largest tenant with 700,000 square feet, moves ahead with a rumored jump to Vornado\u2019s Penn 2. While Nomura\u2019s lease runs to 2033, it has a termination option in 2027, which it had to exercise by July 1; it\u2019s unclear if it did so.\nThe 49-story property \u2014 built in 1989 as part of a 2 million-square-foot complex with condos, theater space and a public plaza \u2014 is the last asset held by New York REIT, which had been sparring with SL Green and RXR in court over a $90 million reserve. A judge ruled in February the money\nbelongs to the REIT\n.\nWorldwide Plaza\u2019s collapse is part of a broader trend of Manhattan office towers with pre-pandemic debt facing steep write-downs. This week, Charles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue was\nappraised at $41 million\n, down from $300 million in 2015.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It was the longtime home of the late Robert Dow, an Olympic fencer and managing partner at Lord, Abbett &amp; Co., and his wife, asset manager Christina Seix Dow.\nTheir daughter, Lindsay Dow, is handling the sale through\nRichard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\n, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The asking price breaks down to $2,107 per square foot.\nThe French Provincial main house, built in 1928, spans roughly 14,000 square feet with 16 bedrooms, banquet dining, a gold-leaf-trimmed salon, wine cellar and a wood-paneled library. A converted chapel serves as a sitting room.\nExterior buildings include a six-bedroom 1930s guesthouse, a two-bedroom carriage house from the 1920s and a secluded log cabin overlooking rolling hills. The grounds also feature two pools, a tennis court, a boathouse on Tuxedo Lake, a koi pond pavilion and a 2,000-kilowatt solar array that, along with geothermal energy, powers the entire property.\n\nRobert Dow, who fished in Tuxedo Park as a boy, reportedly jumped at the chance to buy Renamor in the 1990s, though it\u2019s unclear how much he paid for the property. The family split time there until returning full-time in 2016, hosting charity dinners and community events during Covid.\nTuxedo Park, once a playground for New York\u2019s elite, retains its private country club and lore as the birthplace of the tuxedo jacket.\nDespite pandemic-era price spikes, Orange County real estate trails Hudson River east-bank markets.

        "content": "Russell Weiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, is alleging the project manager and general contractor of his $100 million-plus estate in Miami Beach completed defective work that lacked the proper approvals and permits.\nWeiner\u2019s Pine Tree Development filed a new lawsuit this summer against Andrea D\u2019Alessio and his Inspirata Management Company, Deere Construction/Deere Industries and Baco Engineering Contractor, focusing on alleged site-wide issues he discovered at 5011 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach.\nThe complaint adds to the\nbillionaire\u2019s saga\nover the waterfront assemblage, where he plans the \u201cmost incredible estate in Miami,\u201d Weiner previously told\nThe Real Deal.\nThat includes a new 30,000-square-foot main mansion at 5011 Pine Tree Drive.\nThe complaint alleges that structures on the properties were built without the required building permits or zoning approvals. (Some construction was being done via a private provider and a phased permit, which allows property owners to use private providers to review plans and perform inspections that the city would otherwise handle.)\nThe complaint further cites alleged issues that include the improper installation of more than 400 piles; that the entire site was inadequately filled, compacted and graded, leading to\nsinkholes, soil instability and erosion post-rainfall; incorrectly installed sewer lines that triggered a stop-work order, which required the entire project be reworked; and a generator pad that was installed without approval.\nThe complaint also alleges issues with the reconstruction of the boat house that was built in the 1920s; variances between what was built and what was approved at the Collins estate at 5011 Pine Tree, which was deemed architecturally significant by the city; missing drainage and other examples of improper construction, according to the lawsuit.\nInspirata and D\u2019Alessio filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on Monday, court filings show. The judge has not yet ruled.\n\u201cAndrea [D\u2019Alessio] is one of the most talented architects I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Glen Waldman, Inspirata and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to have the court determine not only did he do nothing wrong, but this is personal vendetta by Mr. Weiner for reasons we can\u2019t understand.\u201d\nWaldman, a partner at Armstrong Teasdale, said he expects his clients will be vindicated and will seek to collect legal fees and costs from Weiner.\nWeiner declined to comment on the litigation.\n\nWeiner\u2019s plans to relocate and preserve the Collins estate were documented in 2023 by the Miami Design Preservation League. The structure was moved to the western portion of the property. The Collins estate was designed by architect Russell Pancoast and built in the 1920s by Irving Collins, a son of Miami Beach founding father John Collins.\nA group of\nanonymous neighbors last year\nindicated issues with construction, pointing to the alleged forgery of a notarized notice of commencement filed with Miami-Dade County. Such notices typically mark the start of construction, and are secured in conjunction with a building permit in the property\u2019s respective municipality.\nWeiner\u2019s company first sued D\u2019Alessio and related parties last fall after\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the alleged red flags. An amended complaint submitted in December alleged D\u2019Alessio, Inspirata and another of D\u2019Alessio\u2019s companies crafted \u201cschemes to defraud and cheat\u201d the property owner through overbilling, false charges and self-dealing.\nD\u2019Alessio allegedly promoted himself as a \u201crenowned architectural designer\u201d and residential contractor, but he didn\u2019t have a Florida license for design, construction, or any certifications with respect to design or development, according to the December complaint.\nD\u2019Alessio denied the allegations, and previously said that Weiner knew D\u2019Alessio was not the general contractor. State records show D\u2019Alessio received his general contractor\u2019s license in May of this year.\nDeere\u2019s lawyer, Francisco Touron III, declined to comment, but wrote via email that the company is \u201cprepared to aggressively defend against Plaintiff\u2019s spurious claims.\u201d\nWeiner acquired the two lots from private school owners David and Leila Centner in 2021, hiring D\u2019Alessio\u2019s Inspirata as a project manager and owner\u2019s representative for construction of the waterfront estate. As part of the agreement, Weiner\u2019s company would pay Inspirata nearly $41,000 a month tied to the design, development and construction of the properties.\nThe latest complaint alleges breach of contract, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. In Inspirata and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s motion to dismiss, their attorneys claim that Pine Tree Development failed to satisfy Florida law\u2019s requirements for breach of contract, among other arguments. The motion to dismiss also argues that the agreement between Pine Tree and Inspirata \u201cexplicitly states that Inspirata is not responsible for construction.\u201d\nThe properties are separated by the slender home at 5101 Pine Tree Drive, which Weiner also owns \u2014 he acquired the middle piece\nvia foreclosure\nof\nRichard and Maria Meruelo\u2019s\nproperty.\nWeiner hasn\u2019t disclosed his plans for the assemblage, but demolition of the 5101 Pine Tree home is underway, he wrote via text. (Miami Beach allows property owners to aggregate up to three contiguous parcels if the third lot is used for expanded yards or accessory structures, like pools, cabanas and sports courts.) Records show a notice of commencement for the demolition was signed last week.\n",

He started sketching towns at eight years old, and collecting architecture books at age 12. At 13, he asked for a job with local architect Sanford Kent and got his start in the field. He went on to study architecture at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n.\nHis master\u2019s thesis in 1950 foreshadowed what would become the Capitol Records Building. Naidorf imagined that computers would become ubiquitous and compact, eliminating the need for large offices. He proposed creating circular office buildings to optimize space.\nRather than attend his commencement ceremony, Naidorf interviewed at architecture firm Welton Becket and Associates and was hired on the spot. Three years later, he was entrusted with his first major assignment, dubbed \u201cProject X.\u201d He was given little information other than the building\u2019s dimensions and location and had no idea that it would become the headquarters of Capitol Records.\nNaidorf applied the round shape to the building and aimed to design a \u201chappy building\u201d both for tenants and passersby. Naidorf repeatedly debunked the myth that the building was designed to resemble a stack of records, though he welcomed the comparisons, saying \u201cIf it makes people happy to think that, so be it.\u201d\n\nThe Capitol Records Building opened in 1956 and was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 2006.\nBesides the famous structure in Hollywood, Naidorf also designed the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the\nBeverly Center\n, the Beverly Hilton hotel, the now-demolished L.A. Memorial Sports Arena, and the Ronald Reagan State Building.\nOutside of L.A., Naidorf led the six-year restoration of the California State Capitol in Sacramento, and designed the Rancho Mirage home of former President Gerald Ford. He also designed Phoenix\u2019s Valley National Bank building, now the Chase Tower, the tallest structure in Arizona; and the Hyatt Regency Dallas and its adjacent Reunion Tower.\nNaidorf retired at 87 but kept his architecture license active, maintaining the oldest active license in the state by taking renewal exams every year. He\u2019s survived by his daughter, four stepchildren, 11 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plans for a privately-funded Chicago Fire FC stadium received a boost of South Loop resident support.\nThe South Loop Neighbors group conducted a survey of more than 650 residents and found that 73 percent were supportive, and almost 45 percent of supporters were \u201cstrongly supportive\u201d of the proposal. About 10 percent of respondents said they were opposed to the Major League Soccer team\u2019s proposal, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe team\u2019s owner, billionaire Joe Mansueto, plans to personally bankroll the $650 million soccer stadium for the Chicago Fire FC at The 78, Related Midwest\u2019s long-stalled megadevelopment in the South Loop. The Fire\u2019s Soldier Field lease expires this year, though the team plans to extend it to bridge the gap until the new stadium is ready.\nThe planned 22,000-seat open-air stadium, designed by architecture firm Gensler, would give the Fire its own home after years of sharing use of Soldier Field with the Chicago Bears. The stadium would also serve as an anchor for The 78, a 62-acre area along the Chicago River between Chinatown and Roosevelt Road.\n\nThe neighborhood support comes several weeks after Related Midwest submitted its zoning application for the stadium plan to the City Council. Even though the stadium itself will be privately funded, city officials will still need to figure out how tax-increment financing dollars could be used to pay for public infrastructure for better access and connectivity.\nThe\u00a0 South Loop Neighbors group said about 75 percent of the residents that participated in the survey were area homeowners. Some of the comments generated were supportive of the stadium design and vision for a riverwalk extension and other amenities, but concerns about traffic congestion and pedestrian connectivity were brought up. Plans for a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line station at 15th Street and Clark Street were tossed by\nRelated Midwest\nin June.\nIn a deal struck earlier this year,\nMansueto\n, the Morningstar Credit founder who bought the team in 2019, would buy 10 acres at The 78.\nTerms for the revised redevelopment agreement are still being negotiated by Related Midwest and city planning officials as the scope of the project takes shape. The original 2019 plan called for up to $551 million in infrastructure projects that Related would finance up front and be reimbursed for through property tax gains generated onsite.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

JLL Capital Markets\u2019 Christopher Peck and Nicco Lupo arranged the debt.\nInterVest also structured an equity package covering acquisition and predevelopment costs.\nPark Tower has already delivered roughly 3,000 units across nine parcels at Greenpoint Landing, with another 2,500 in the pipeline.

The site\u2019s momentum is further boosted by neighborhood amenities \u2014 from cafes to grocery stores \u2014 and a planned elementary school nearby.\nThe New York Liberty also recently announced an $80 million, 75,000-square-foot practice facility in Greenpoint, slated to open in 2027, underscoring the area\u2019s pull for high-profile investment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal had been in the works for about six months. Glaser\u2019s investor and partner, Jarrett and Sean Posner\u2019s firm, financed the purchase.\nGlaser could sell or rent the existing home as is, but he is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nThe listing agent, Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said Kahn told him he spent more than $30 million combined on two renovations of the now 19,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom and 13-bathroom mansion. The\nKahns\npaid $2.4 million for their\nNorth Bay Road\nproperty in 1991, records show. The home was built in 1936. It includes a pool, new seawall, dock and a tennis court.\n\u201cThe house is in very good condition,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s got all the bells and whistles.\u201d\n\nGlaser has said he could flip the property or build the new mansion. He hired Domo Architecture + Design to design a 35,000-square-foot mansion, which would include a movie theater; wellness center with a sauna, steam room and fitness center; pickleball and paddle courts; a lap pool; a main pool and a 27-car understory.\nThe lot is nearly 500 feet deep and has about 290 feet of waterfront.\nNorth Bay Road is home to celebrity buyers who include\nDavid and Victoria Beckham\n, the Bee Gees\u2019 Barry Gibb, Cindy Crawford, Michael Bay and Shakira.\nLand prices in Miami Beach have hit record highs this summer.\nNearby on North Bay Road, Witkoff sold the 0.4-acre waterfront property at 4766 North Bay Road for $24.3 million, or\n$1,370 per square foot\n. It was the highest price per square foot for land ever achieved in Miami Beach \u2014 until Colombian businessman Jorge Mattos and his wife, Patricia, sold their waterfront home at 68 La Gorce Circle on Miami Beach\u2019s La Gorce Island\nfor $32.7 million\n, or about $1,700 per square foot earlier this month.\nThe current asking price for Glaser\u2019s property \u2014 for purchase and rent \u2014 marks the priciest in Miami-Dade County.\nThe second most-expensive rental on the market is the waterfront mansion at 440 South Mashta Drive in Key Biscayne, asking more than $433,000 a month with Gustavo Gambino of Gambino Real Estate Corp. The second priciest home for sale is actually a three-house, 2.1-acre compound at 190 Palm Avenue, on the market for $148.5 million with Fredrik Eklund of the Eklund-Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman.\n",

That six-bed, seven-bath home was restored by fashion designer Sue Wong.\n\nWith Fear of God\u2019s continued ascent, Lorenzo and family\u2019s real estate also expanded at the end of 2023. That\u2019s when the designer and his wife purchased 9051 Briarcrest Lane in Beverly Hills Post Office for $19.5 million.\n\u201cIn Beverly Hills, it feels like you\u2019re away from the chaos of the city but somehow still in it.

The business includes the luxury streetwear label, where knit T-shirts easily go for over $1,000 and trousers are around $1,200. There\u2019s also a more accessible Fear of God Essentials line. The newest addition to the business is the Fear of God Athletics label, which is being created in partnership with Adidas.\nThe company\u2019s former CEO told\nVogue Business\nin 2023 the business had room to eventually grow to $1 billion in sales. Revenue at that time was reportedly in the range of $200 million to $300 million.\n",

The deal, down from the\n$13.5 million\nhe paid for it in 2017, works out to roughly $3,200 a square foot.\nThe Pershing Square Capital Management founder bought Unit 8F about a month before he closed on another unit on the same floor for $8.6 million. Ackman\nsought to offload\nboth apartments, listed in November with the option to purchase separately or together, for a combined $20 million.\nUnit 8F, which nabbed a signed contract in April, spans more than 2,900 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features a gas fireplace, an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park.\nUnit 8E is still on the market with an asking price of $8.3 million.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern and Sloane Square\u2019s Vivian Fisher, who represented Ackman in the deal, declined to comment. Both brokers are sharing the listing for the remaining apartment.\nBefore buying the two eighth-floor units, Ackman lived at the pre-war co-op with his ex-wife, Karen Ann Herskovitz. The couple paid $26 million for a duplex in 2006, which at the time was the property\u2019s priciest deal.\nThe 20-story building between West 81st and West 82nd streets is known for housing a\nnumber of notable buyers\n, including actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld, actress Glenn Close, singer Diana Ross and the former CEO of Coach, Lewis Frankfort. Amenities in the building include full-time doormen and a fitness center.\nAmong Ackman\u2019s other Manhattan trades are a Norman Foster-designed penthouse on West 77th Street, which he bought for $22.5 million and later\nwent to bat\nover plans for the property with the Landmark Preservation Commission. He also paid\n$91.5 million\nfor a penthouse at Extell Development\u2019s One57 in 2015.\n",

Horton\n, buying 1.5 million shares for about $203 million in the first quarter. It sold 27,000 D.R. Horton shares for an estimated $3.3 million in the second quarter.\n\nLed by co-CEOs Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe,\nLennar\nis a major homebuilder in South Florida. The firm has particularly seized on south Miami-Dade County, an area with a vast land supply that comes at a discount compared with development sites in South Florida\u2019s urban cores.\nIts most recent proposals are for the\nRetro West\ncomplex with 106 townhouses on a 10-acre site on the northwest corner of Southwest 338th Street and Southwest 192nd Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade, near\nHomestead\n. In January, Lennar filed an application to develop\nRodan Estates\nwith 138 single-family homes on a 20-acre site on the southeast corner of Southwest 220th Street and Southwest 133rd Court near Goulds, as well as a community with 54 homes on a 9.2-acre site on the southeast corner of Southwest 212th Street and Southwest 127th Avenue in Goulds.\nLennar bought three south Miami-Dade residential developments from Coral Gables-based Century Homebuilders Group for a combined\n$24.8 million\n. The properties are Portobello Estates at Southeast 18th Avenue and the Florida Turnpike Extension, where 54 single-family homes are proposed; Century Park Villas East at Northeast First Avenue and Palm Drive in Homestead, proposed for 117 townhomes; and Century Estates Royal at 192nd Avenue and Mowry Drive in Homestead, proposed for 54 units in 27 duplexes and three single-family homes.\n",

        "content": "Lore Development Group plans a 402-unit apartment project on a portion of the closed Johnson &amp; Wales University campus in North Miami,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nLore, a joint venture between Leste Group and Brazilian firm Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio, wants to develop the Biscayne North Miami building on a 3.2-acre site on three lots east and west of Northeast 17th Avenue, between Northeast 126th and 127th streets, according to Jorge Rucas of Leste. Designed by Corwil Architects, the building will consist of studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments. All will be market-rate rentals.\nThe preliminary plan is for an eight-story building, Rucas said.\nConstruction is expected to start by the third quarter of next year, and completion is expected in 2028, he added.\nThe development site consists of parking lot parcels at 1660 Northeast 127th Street and 12600 Northeast 17th Avenue, as well as a vacant lot.\nBrickell-based Lore paid $26 million for the property in June, securing a $13 million acquisition loan from Brickell-based Linkvest Capital, records show.\nChris Lentz of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Lore in the financing.\nThe seller, Chicago-based Golub &amp; Co., paid\n$10 million\nfor the site in 2021, according to records. Golub had planned a 450-unit multifamily building, and Leste and Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio were investors with Golub in the site and project.\nThe Lore JV, which was formed in 2023, now is the site\u2019s owner and project developer after the recent purchase, Rucas said.\n\u201cWe had a different LP [limited partners] and co-GP [general partners] structure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was another development and partners involved. [Now] instead of being just investors, we are now the developer.\u201d\n\nLeste, led by CEO Emmanuel Hermann and managing partner Stephan de Sabrit, is a global alternative investment manager focused on real estate, private equity and other business lines such as Brazilian agribusiness, according to its website. It lists offices in Miami\u2019s Brickell, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro-based Opportunity Fundo de Investimento Imobili\u00e1rio, founded in 1994, is an independent asset manager, its website shows. Marcelo Naidich is the portfolio manager.\nLore\u2019s pipeline of South Florida projects includes the 48-unit Lincoln Coconut Grove condo building at the intersection of Southwest 27th and Lincoln avenues and Darwin Street in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove.\nIt also plans the 505-unit Summit at Brickell multifamily tower on the half-acre site on the southeast corner of Southwest 10th Street and Southwest First Avenue in Miami\u2019s financial district. The firm paid\n$35 million\nfor the development site in 2023.\nLore is in the \u201clast mile\u201d of reviews and permitting needed before it starts construction of Summit at Brickell, Rucas said.\nJohnson &amp; Wales University, which trained South Florida\u2019s hospitality workforce, closed its North Miami outpost in 2021. Miami-based Property Markets Group beat more than a dozen firms to scoop up the 25-acre campus, putting it under contract for\n$60 millio\nn in 2021. It then flipped portions of the campus to other developers.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group paid\n$13.6 million\nfor a 3-acre site at JWU in 2022, where it\u2019s developing the eight-story, 382-unit Manor Biscayne apartment building.\nAlso in 2022, North Miami-based Tate Capital bought the university\u2019s former recreation center at 1600 Northeast 126th Street for\n$10.7 million\n, leasing it to the city of North Miami under a 15-year term.\nMater Academy Charter Schools paid\n$16.8 million\nfor several JWU sites in 2022, opening a K-12 charter school in at least one of the buildings it purchased.\n",

        "content": "A nine-story Pasadena office tower traded hands at a discount. Swift Real Estate Partners sold the property to GD Realty for $31.5 million, Omid Broukhim, who represented the buyer, said. The buyer and a source familiar with the off-market deal confirmed the price.\nThe property at 790 East Colorado Boulevard, called The Terrace, was part of a three-building office complex in Pasadena that Swift Real Estate partners\npurchased\nfrom PGIM Real Estate for $193 million six years ago. The offices at 790 East Colorado Boulevard were purchased for $59 million, property records reveal.\nThe 146,000-square-foot office building is 70 percent leased, according to a release announcing the sale by JLL, which represented the seller. JLL declined to comment. Swift Real Estate Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment. GD Realty chief executive and founder Arash Danialifar said it was \u201cone of the most unique office buildings I have encountered.\u201d\nThe three properties were collectively known as \u201cThe Pasadena Collection,\u201d and spanned 517,000 square feet. The portfolio was 68 percent occupied then. The two other properties were a 212,000 square-foot building at 155 North Lake Avenue, and a 159,000 square-foot building at 35 North Lake Avenue.\n\nRecently, another office complex in Pasadena\nsold\nat a discount. Harbor Associates and Roxborough Group purchased the Pasadena Towers for $120 million. The seller, CBRE Investment Management, purchased the two office properties, at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard that total 477,000 square feet, for $256 million in 2016.\nThat isn\u2019t the only distress happening in the city. The Pasadena Office Tower at 150 South Los Robles Avenue saw its value\ndecline\n59 percent in a decade and is worth millions less than the loan connected to the property.\nThe San Gabriel Valley, where Pasadena is located, has an 8.2 percent office vacancy rate compared to that of all Greater Los Angeles, which has a 24.1 percent vacancy rate.\n",

        "content": "Paramount Group is facing scrutiny over whether the company is putting the interests of its CEO Albert Behler ahead of shareholders.\nParamount, a publicly traded REIT and a major landlord in New York City and San Francisco, revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this year it paid millions of dollars to Behler\u2019s outside businesses, including to a private jet company in which Behler had a 50 percent stake.\nLast month, the firm disclosed it is under an SEC investigation over disclosures related to conflicts of interest, perks, related-party deals, and executive compensation.\nNow,\nThe Real Deal\ndiscovered Behler pushed for a no-bid securities contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building in which Paramount holds only a 5 percent stake, to Guardian Services, according to sources and communications reviewed by\nTRD\n.\nContracts of this size are not usually required to go through a bidding process or board review.\nIt is unusual, however, for a chief executive of a billion-dollar REIT to get directly involved in such small-scale deals. Guardian\u2019s contract went into effect in August, amid the ongoing SEC probe into conflicts of interest and news of the company\u2019s payments for Behler\u2019s personal and business interests, making Behler\u2019s decision to wade into the deal more questionable.\nCompounding these questions: Behler previously dated a now-senior employee at Guardian, who was involved in attracting new business with Paramount, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nAfter dating, the two maintained a friendly, often informal relationship at least through 2020, according to text messages reviewed by\nTRD.\nThe two shared at least one lunch at high-end restaurant Le Bernadin, in addition to other meetings \u2014 not out of bounds given the employee\u2019s role in business development \u2014 and the Paramount CEO shared internal information about his firm\u2019s property.\nIn those messages, the employee, about 30 years Behler\u2019s junior, refers to Behler as \u201cAlbertcim,\u201d using a suffix meant to show endearment in the Turkish language, with the term roughly translating to \u201cmy dear Albert.\u201d (\nTRD\nconsulted with four Turkish speakers who said this would be unusual in a professional relationship.) In a voice memo, Behler told the Guardian employee details about internal moves in a Paramount building, telling her to \u201ckeep this to herself.\u201d\nParamount\u2019s board of directors said the romantic relationship began in 2009 and ended in 2012, based on documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. (Behler disclosed the relationship to Paramount and the board of directors.)\nBehler\u2019s personal relationships would not be a matter of public concern had Paramount put the contract out for a competitive bidding process. Alternatively, Behler, who is 73 years old, could have allowed Paramount\u2019s property management team to handle minor decisions about building operations.\nA Paramount spokesperson claimed the contract was arms-length and adhered to Paramount\u2019s internal policies.\n\u201cParamount Group and its employees followed all of the company\u2019s internal policies and procedures, including conflict of interest policies, in connection with entering into an arms-length contract with Guardian Service Industries for security-related services at 60 Wall Street,\u201d a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement.\nGuardian did not return a request for comment.\nCompensation package\nAn SEC probe and questionable contracts aside, Behler\u2019s generous compensation and perks compared to his industry peers have sparked headlines and concerns.\nAn analyst at Green Street put out a report to clients earlier this year, noting there was a \u201cmisalignment\u201d between the interests of Paramount\u2019s management and shareholders, noting top executives\u2019 high pay packages relative to Paramount\u2019s returns. (Behler was paid over $20 million in compensation in 2023 plus additional benefits disclosed earlier this year.)\nIn late July, as\nTRD\nreported, Paramount disclosed in its second-quarter earnings that it was under an SEC investigation over disclosures related to executive compensation, perks, related-party transactions and conflicts of interest. In the filing, Paramount said it is cooperating with the SEC.\nThe 60 Wall contract wasn\u2019t the first time Guardian, a major player in the facility services space, attempted to do business with Paramount. In late 2024, Guardian bid on a cleaning services contract for a seven-building Paramount portfolio valued in the tens of millions. That portfolio did not include 60 Wall, according to documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. By the spring of 2025, Paramount\u2019s board did not approve Guardian\u2019s bid and the contract was awarded to another facilities firm.\nThen a smaller deal came along. One, worth just over $1 million, which did not require explicit board approval and would not even warrant a footnote in its public filings. And Behler himself directed staff to make the move.\nPrior relationship\nIn the backdrop of these transactions is the fact that Behler and a current senior manager of Guardian, who once dated but both of whom are now married to\u00a0other\u00a0people, knew each other well, something Paramount\u2019s board was aware of. The two stayed in contact and met on multiple occasions in 2019 and 2020.\nTRD\nreviewed numerous text messages between the Guardian employee and Behler, suggesting the two maintained a friendly personal relationship. This happened while the now-Guardian employee worked in a business development role for a building maintenance company that was a competitor to Guardian and had contracts with Paramount.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, Behler texted the employee: \u201cHow are you? Hope all well. Talk tomorrow?\u201d\nHer: \u201cYes please \ud83d\ude42 call me anytime xoxo\u201d\nAB: \u201ctime for lunch?\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat will be so nice to see you. Yes I am available.\u201d\nAB: \u201c12:30 le Bernadin lounge.\u201d\nHer: \u201cPerfect.\nIn February 2020, the employee texted: \u201cAlbertcim, thank you for meeting me today. If you google platinum, palladium and sterling they all have the same address. 120 Broadway.\u201d\nAB: \u201cSame here. Good to see you. Xx\u201d\nHer: \u201cXox\u201d\nThat same month, Behler sent the employee a heads-up about a recent personnel departure at 1325 Sixth Avenue of the Americas, a 34-story office tower in Manhattan. In a voice message reviewed by\nTRD,\nBehler told her that he \u201cwant[s] to talk about the 1325 thing. Keep it [to] yourself. She is going to go to another property because of a conflict they have.\u201d\nBy July, Covid had forced employees to work remotely. San Francisco, where Paramount was a prominent office owner, had put a pause on all business reopenings. The entire industry was facing an existential crisis of whether the office sector would ever recover.\nOn July 24th, 2020, the employee texted: \u201cAlbertcim just wanted to confirm we are meeting. On the 28th. I have a few important things to go over.\u201d\nAlbert Behler: \u201cYes, we do meet. Looking forward. I can do afternoon, say around 4/5 pm ok?\u201d\nThe employee: \u201cPerfect!! Looking forward to it. Let me know where we can meet. \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\nMore questions than answers\nParamount said the contract at 60 Wall does not expose it to any meaningful economic impact or risk.\n60 Wall is also the only contract between Guardian and Paramount, according to a spokesperson for Paramount. It was not an existing relationship.\nIt is an odd transaction for the firm\u2019s CEO to personally undertake, given that Paramount barely owns the property.\nThe Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC took on a 95 percent stake in 60 Wall in 2017, and Paramount, which controlled a 5 percent stake, was tasked with managing the property and day-to-day operations. Paramount became the public face of the 47-story tower.\nThe building, once home to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, is now empty and undergoing a $250 million renovation. A spokesperson for GIC directed all inquiries to Paramount. GIC said it is no longer the majority owner of the property. It is unclear whether Paramount disclosed information about the contract with Guardian and Behler\u2019s direct involvement in the deal to the building\u2019s majority owners.\nParamount is now exploring a potential sale of the company as its stock is trading under $7. It hired Bank of America as a financial advisor.\nParamount\u2019s board previously rejected two bids to sell the company, including one in February 2022, at as high as $12 a share. Once private, shareholder concerns and public disclosure will no longer be a concern.",

The financing works out to $311,751 per unit.\nThe debt replaces a prior $130 million mortgage from\nMF1\nthat came due last year and is being rolled into a $915 million collateralized loan obligation. The financing matures in 2028 with an option to extend to 2030.\nThe loan is the largest in the CLO and was sold into the pool by an entity tied to Bridge\u2019s Debt Strategies Fund V. The Utah-based private credit shop raised $2.9 billion for its previous fund in 2022, but it has raised only $62.6 million so far toward its $2.5 billion target for the current one, SEC filings show.\n\nBuilt by Goel in 2016, 500 Station was appraised at $178 million, with an $8 million estimated net cash flow. Occupancy was 95.4 percent as of last month, helped by $500 leasing concessions to keep units filled through October. About one-third of tenants use Section 8 vouchers, a share that could grow to 50 percent under a plan Fitch said is meant to boost \u201cincome reliability and community benefit.\u201d Amenities include a pool, fitness center, golf simulator, bocce courts and a pet-washing station.\nThe property only generates enough income currently to cover 58 percent of its debt service costs, according to the loan servicer\u2019s latest reports on the\nproperty\n. The new business plan calls for rent hikes, expense stabilization and an eventual takeout with permanent financing. Aurora\u2019s multifamily market has outperformed the metro in rent growth over the past\ndecade\n, with a nearly 50 percent jump compared with 35 percent for greater Chicago, Fitch noted.\nGoel Investments, a privately held firm with more than 20 completed projects, has holdings across asset classes in multiple states. Its portfolio includes Chicago\u2019s 239-unit Rosenwald Court Apartments, the 256-unit Courthouse and Walthall Lofts in Jackson, Mississippi, and a 527-unit affordable housing portfolio along Mississippi\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Student housing in Berkeley continues to grow, with the latest offering coming from NX Ventures.\nThe Berkeley-based firm has submitted plans to build a 214-unit dorm-style student apartment building at 1899 Oxford Street, across the street from the University of California, Berkeley campus, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe project would be composed of dorm-style efficiency apartments with common kitchens, lounges and study spaces for residents on each floor. A fitness room and roof deck is also planned for the site.\nIt would include 17 very-low-income and 16 middle-income units, giving the project a 96.3 percent density bonus. The Berkeley-based developer and Trachtenberg Architects applied using SB 330, which would expedite approval process, eliminate some restrictions on housing development and limit the number of public meetings for a project.\nJust a few years ago, Berkeley\u2019s housing market was one of the most competitive in the Bay Area. UC Berkeley and private multifamily developers have sought to fill that gap, creating thousands of beds and driving down rents up to 25 percent, according to the Business Times. The university provides housing for only a quarter of its student body \u2014 the lowest rate in the UC system.\n\nNX Ventures\nis partnered with property owner Berkland Foundation to bring the Oxford Street development to life. It initially considered building housing on the site\u2019s parking lot, and before the pandemic, it was in talks with the university to either sell the property or develop it into student housing for the university.\nWith the passing of new state legislation and local zoning code changes that enabled a larger and denser project than previously planned, NX Ventures abandoned its plans with the university and filed its own plans with the city. NX and Berkland Foundation never entered a contract or development agreement with the university.\nTo make way for the project, the developer would demolish a two-story, eight-unit multifamily building owned by the Berkland Foundation and merge two lots. The residential building was used for Garber House, a professional and educational center for men, though its relocation last year a block away freed up space to increase housing capacity from 167 units to 214.\nNX Ventures\u2019 project is slated to come before the Zoning Adjustment Board in the fall. Construction on the project is estimated to begin next spring and complete in summer 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A once-struggling downtown Houston office tower is headed for a second act as apartments.\nChicago-based 3L Real Estate filed plans to convert One City Centre, at 1021 Main Street, into a 553-unit residential project, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The $26.5 million redevelopment, designed by Gensler\u2019s Houston office, is slated to start in 2026 and finish by the end of 2027.\nThe 780,530-square-foot tower will feature 93 \u201chotel apartments\u201d \u2014 corporate suites for visiting employees \u2014 on the second through sixth floors, and 460 traditional apartments on floors seven through 29.\n3L CEO Joseph Slezak said the concept is still in early stages, but the building\u2019s rectangular floor plates offer flexibility for layouts.\nThe firm specializes in turning underperforming office buildings into housing, a strategy it has deployed in more than a dozen projects nationwide.\n\nDelaware Street Capital\nbought\nOne City Centre last year from special servicer\nMidland\n, which seized the 65-year-old building from Accesso Partners after years of financial strain and more than 500,000 square feet of vacancy. The property\u2019s largest tenant, Waste Management, exited in 2020, leaving it about 90 percent empty. By 2023, annual net operating income barely topped $2,000, and its valuation plunged from $162 million in 2015 to just under $26 million a year ago.\nSlezak said 3L will pursue historic preservation credits and other tax incentives to make the numbers work. Houston\u2019s office-to-residential conversions often hinge on such subsidies, given the high costs of retrofitting older buildings for plumbing, electrical and residential amenities. Downtown Houston+, the nonprofit charged with promoting downtown, has floated an incentive program modeled after the city\u2019s prior Downtown Living Initiative, which fueled a wave of apartment development.\nOne City Centre has been on local planners\u2019 radar as a prime conversion candidate because of its large floor plates, ample parking, direct access to Houston\u2019s tunnel system and a central elevator core that leaves options for design. JLL\u2019s marketing materials projected it could hold up to 550 units averaging 900 square feet.\nIf 3L delivers, the project will add significant housing to a downtown with one of the highest\noffice vacancy\nrates in the nation \u2014 25.2 percent as of late 2023 \u2014 and join a growing national pipeline of obsolete office towers making the jump to multifamily.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It would be one of the largest luxury mixed-use developments in Southern California.\nCain is asking the city to form a Community Facilities District on the site, utilizing \u201ca public financing tool authorized under the state\u2019s Mello-Roos Act that allows for the funding of specific public infrastructure and services through special taxes on the properties that directly benefit,\u201d Jeff Muir, director of finance for the city of Beverly Hills, said.\nMuir noted the tax is only levied on the properties in the district\u2014in this case, the One Beverly Hills site. The taxes collected would repay the up to $550 million in bonds requested. Earlier this year, Cain\nsecured $300 million in mezzanine financing\nfor the project from Vici Properties.\nSpanning 17.5 acres next to the Beverly Hilton, the project calls for two new condo towers rising 412 and 453 feet and the luxury Aman hotel at 124 feet tall. Green space would include four acres of open space reserved for condo residents and 4.5 acres open to the public. Amenities include a conference center, retail and dining space. The project would also include the renovation of the Beverly Hilton hotel.\n\nThe project was approved by the City Council in 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2028.\nIt\u2019s been more than two decades since the city created a CFD and levied a special tax in the Golden Triangle and on Rodeo Drive to pay for upgrades to the area. Mayor Sharona Nazarian believes the bond created there had a \u201csignificant\u201d positive impact on the community and is \u201choping that this will also have the same kind of process.\u201d\nThe City Council will take up the matter at its Aug. 19 meeting.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Property owner Kennedy Wilson had paid off the interest on the $60 million loan on the property but did not amortize entirely.\nSpanning 411,100 square feet across seven buildings, the office campus saw an exodus of tenants in recent years. Occupancy rates fell from 85 percent in 2021 to 55 percent as of this May. It lost one of its largest tenants, Visual Concepts Entertainment, when its lease for 64,200 square feet expired in July. The increased vacancy ostensibly made it harder to refinance the loan, the outlet said.\nKennedy Wilson\nlisted the property for sale earlier this year, though it hasn\u2019t found a buyer yet. The Beverly Hills-based investment firm bought the 20-acre campus in 2019 for $115 million, including the $60 million loan.\nSince 2020, more than $4.1 million has been invested into the property on upgrades to the building and its amenities. This included the construction of \u201cThe Landing,\u201d an outdoor tenant amenity space.\n\nHamilton Landing was built in 1933 and was a former military base before being decommissioned in the 1970s. It holds an interesting spot in World War II history as planes from the base happened to arrive in Pearl Harbor the morning of Dec. 7, 1941.\nThe group of airplane hangars was converted into office space in 2000 by Barker Pacific Group and Prudential Real Estate Investors. The companies sank $100 million into the redevelopment.\nCurrent tenants at Hamilton Landing include video game company Take Two Interactive Software, the Marin Community Foundation, footwear brand Vionic and analytics company Fair Isaac Corporation.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "When a home sale snags a headline in\nThe Real Deal,\nit usually meets one or two points of criteria: an upper eight- or nine-figure price tag or a notable name attached.\nIt\u2019s not a hard and fast rule, but one we tend to stick to when picking which deals warrant coverage. (\nTRD\nisn\u2019t shy about its standards \u2014 columnist Erik Engquist\nlaid them out\nin an article last January.) Every now and then, a deal that doesn\u2019t fit the mold will catch our eye because of what it says about a given market, with details such as a premium flip or a major flop serving as valuable fodder for our readers.\nThen there are the record breakers.\nWe cover the obvious ones\u00a0 \u2014 the\n$60 million\nduplex that claimed the title of the most expensive condo sale in Downtown Manhattan; Ken Griffin\u2019s $238 million Billionaires\u2019 Row purchase that notched a new all-time high for the nation; an\n$80 million\nmansion on the Upper East Side that snagged the title of the priciest townhouse trade in the city.\nOther so-called record deals are less clear. Earlier this week, two Brooklyn neighborhoods nabbed record-setting deals that seem like small potatoes compared to some of Manhattan\u2019s eyebrow-raising trades.\nIn East Williamsburg, a penthouse at 28 Herbert Street sold for $3.1 million, or more than\n$1,900 a foot\n, marking the highest price per square foot achieved in the traditionally industrial neighborhood. In Greenpoint, a duplex overlooking McCarren Park traded for just under\n$6 million\n, surpassing the previous condo record holder, a $5.7 million penthouse at the Huron.\nThe deals are notable largely because they\u2019re new high-water marks in neighborhoods where prices have been steadily rising, bolstered by a pandemic-era flight to the outer boroughs and a wave of development beyond the high-priced Williamsburg waterfront.\nOn the residential beat, tracking these peak sales helps us keep tabs on where opportunity exists and which development bets, some of which are still a long ways away from hitting the market, are likely to pan out.\nIn Brooklyn especially, the likelihood of deals to reach a market-moving price varies block by block. That can be a point of contention when covering these records, as the bounds of a neighborhood can be up for debate.\nFor example, the buildings that notched the two deals this week are only just barely within the lines of Greenpoint and East Williamsburg, both teetering on the edge of Williamsburg, where prices started climbing after a rush of development in the 2000s. The neighborhood set down a benchmark unheard of in North Brooklyn with the 2021 sale of a unit at 2 Northside Piers for\n$8.3 million\n, the neighborhood\u2019s priciest condo deal to date.\nAs more development hits the market in these neighborhoods, with new prices along for the ride, they could have a\nTRD\npaper trail charting the rise.\n\nBut there are limits to how much a record has to say about a given market. As for the creative brokers or PR folks who might be reading: no, we won\u2019t be writing about the highest price per square foot achieved for a two-bedroom condo with a balcony in Brooklyn.\nNot so fast\u2026\nIt should come as a shock to no one that New York City, rents reached another record \u2014 least of all residential agents who warned the\nnew broker fee ban\nwould spike rates.\nThe latest report from Miller Samuel shows the median rent in Manhattan reached a\nrecord high\nin July, rising more than 9 percent to $4,700 per month. In Brooklyn, the metric hit its second-highest on record at $3,850, while in Northwest Queens, the median rent was $3,750.\nBut the fallout from the FARE Act, which took effect in early June, likely accounts for only a fraction of the increase, as rents have been reaching unprecedented heights since February, which is typically a slower month for the market. The sky-high prices continued into the summer, when apartments are usually in high demand and rent for top-tier rates.\nReport author Jonathan Miller said demand for rentals has risen, as high interest rates have kept some potential home buyers from pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nWith more tenants hunkering down in their apartments or searching for new ones, rental inventory fell nearly 8 percent last month compared to last July, according to data from Streeteasy. (A decline in rental listings was another consequence to the FARE Act cited by the industry in its opposition to the law.)\nThough inventory dipped citywide, some neighborhoods logged an uptick in available apartments, per\nStreetEasy\u2019s report\n. Gowanus in Brooklyn, the site of a number of new development properties following a 2021 rezoning, led the charge, with inventory more than doubling since last July. Inwood, Fort Greene and Boerum Hill followed.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a resale at Vlad Doronin\u2019s hotel-condo conversion at the Crown Building. The three-bedroom condo, Unit 16A, traded in an off-market deal for\n$28 million\n, about $4 million more than its sponsor sale price.\nThe building at 730 Fifth Avenue, known as the Aman New York, sold the last of its 22 units in January, about six years after sales launched. Its priciest deal was a $135 million penthouse that the developer bought for himself.\n",

        "content": "Ten years ago, Billionaires\u2019 Row was born.\nThe skyscrapers that dot 57th Street marry developer ambitions and the ultra-wealthy\u2019s appetite for secure, if not also flashy and headline-worthy, investments.\nBut as with all real estate acquisitions, nothing is a sure bet. Years later, some of those sky-high safety deposit boxes appear to be safer than others.\nAn analysis of public records by\nThe Real Deal\nshows the wide disparity in the returns that original buyers in five key Billionaires\u2019 Row properties received once they resold units. The analysis compares the prices achieved by sponsor sales, or the first buyers from a developer, to the first time the unit is up for sale by the original owner in five buildings: 220 Central Park South, 432 Park Avenue, 157 West 57th Street, 217 West 57th Street and 111 West 57th Street.\nThese properties are not the only addresses that comprise the slice of the city that changed the market, but are emblematic of the submarket, having been selling for long enough to show how their first buyers fared. Among trophy market observers, Billionaires\u2019 Row is generally agreed to extend beyond the stretch of 57th Street, and Billionaires\u2019 Rectangle just doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue the same.\nAs a market metric, resale performance is indicative of a systematic miscalculation by developers around the city, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller.\n\u201cThe whole premise of it was based on a mistaken assumption that the market was wide enough and deep enough for a lot of buildings to come on simultaneously,\u201d said Miller.\nUltimately it was, according to Miller, a \u201cyou had to be there\u201d moment.\n\u201cThis was a moment in time that has passed, and this submarket will be around for a long time, and there will be other buildings built, but the frenzy that the market experienced is unlikely to be repeated,\u201d he said.\nMore than 10 years after earning its moniker, Billionaires\u2019 Row presents a rather bleak picture for the current owners of these units who bought into these developments with the bet that their prices \u2014 and appeal \u2014 would keep climbing.\nCorcoran\u2019s Kane Manera, who is currently leading sales at Central Park Tower, says that there is time yet for these buildings to appreciate.\n\u201cThe time horizon of purchasing any property, 57th Street or anywhere else, shouldn\u2019t be two, three or four years \u2014 ideally you want something over five or seven years,\u201d he said, pointing to outside factors like the recent rush of new development inventory across the city.\nAssessing resale performance comes with its own quirks, where views, layouts and design can all play a role, according to Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. After taking over from the developer, a unit is at the mercy of its owner\u2019s taste.\nShe also pointed to what she called \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d when trying to assess market performance: concessions.\n\u201cA sponsor might also hang on to a price, but there might be a lot of givebacks at the end of the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often, the price that\u2019s recorded is not the actual price.\u201d\nSuch was the case with the priciest penthouse at 432 Park Avenue. The unit sold for\n$88 million in 2016\n, but only after the co-developer CIM Group provided the buyer with a $56 million loan.\nIt\u2019s often even simpler than that: newest equals best.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, it\u2019s the next new building,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Steinberg. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with these buildings or the layouts, but everyone wants new, fresh, clean and improved amenities.\u201d\nBut time comes for all buildings, and years after the developers have cashed out their chips, the legacy of these buildings will be driven by who still wants to live there \u2014 and what price they will pay to do so.\n220 Central Park South\n(Average price change: +43 percent)\nSteve Roth\u2019s 80-story limestone obelisk needs no introduction. In 2020,\nTRD\nwrote a 4,000-word paean about the \u201c\nworld\u2019s most profitable condo tower\n.\u201d\nAnd while it made its name on the strength of its sponsor sales, including the most expensive home ever sold in the country, it has solidified its standing with unrivaled resale figures. Despite the sales team raising prices a dozen times between 2015 and 2018, which in theory could hinder resales, the first-time sellers in the building have yet to take a loss.\nSteinberg said the \u201conly exception\u201d to his hot new building rule is 220 Central Park South, along with another Robert A.M. Stern-designed building, 15 Central Park West.\n\u201c220 [Central Park South] is 15 CPW on steroids,\u201d he said. \u201cRobert Stern design just holds its own in New York City.\u201d\nThe most noteworthy resale in the building came in 2022 when billionaire financier Daniel Och sold his penthouse to Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai for $188 million, more than double what Och paid for the unit in 2019.\nEven excluding that outlier trade, the building has still on average had resale units go for 36 percent above their sponsor sale price.\n432 Park Avenue\n(Average price change: +2.3 percent)\nHarry Macklowe\u2019s slim supertall on the eastern end of Billionaires\u2019 Row, which launched sales in 2013, is the only other building on this list with a positive performance in the resale market, if just barely.\nThe 125-unit building has been trending in the wrong direction in recent years, however.\nOf the building\u2019s first 13 resales, which spanned 2017 and 2018, only three went for less than the buyer originally paid. Those trades included a two-bedroom on the 53rd floor that sold for $10.8 million, up 80 percent from the original price.\nWith its unique Rafael Vi\u00f1oly-designed facade, towering views and high-end amenities, the\n\nsales team at the building still discounted units when other buildings started popping up \u201cbecause they could see the tsunami of supply coming,\u201d Miller said, which helped steady the boat.\nIts success in resales has largely played out in the background of complaints from tenants, as Miller said, \u201cputting aside all the litigation that seems to be going on.\u201d\nThat litigation includes two separate lawsuits filed by the 432 Park Avenue condo board. The first,\nfiled in 2021\n, alleged construction defects including flooding, broken elevators and noise from the building\u2019s sway. The board\nsued again this year\n, claiming Macklowe and CIM Group knew about the alleged defects.\nCompounding possible effects from the original lawsuit was a preceding deluge of luxury condos that had hit the market and fallout from the pandemic.\nOn average, sales by original buyers since 2021 went for almost 1 percent less than they paid for their sponsor units. And of the 16 units resold for the first time since 2021, 10 went for a loss.\nThe largest dollar value drop came after billionaire financier Thomas Peterffy sold his 84th-floor unit for $13.5 million in 2024, almost 40 percent less than what he paid for it in 2016.\nBut that unit, outfitted with patterned gray rugs and chromatically-tiled walls, points to an issue in assessing resale performance in condo buildings that Olshan pointed out when I called her for this story: \u201cthere\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d\n157 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -24.2 percent)\nGary Barnett\u2019s glass tower, dubbed One57, holds a couple of titles: the first Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, the most sales by original owners and the steepest drop in resale prices among the five condo buildings.\nFor a short period, One57 was in a league of its own when it launched sales in 2011. Billionaire financier Bill Ackman purchased a duplex penthouse for $91.5 million in 2012, setting the record for the city\u2019s priciest sale. But before that deal could close, Dell Technologies CEO and founder Michael Dell one-upped him with a $100 million penthouse purchase in the building that closed in 2014, one year before Ackman\u2019s deal hit city records.\nBut the tower was a\nvictim of its own success\n, spawning its successors that place above it on this list.\n\u201cIt was the tallest condo building ever built,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Ryan Kaplan. \u201cWe were all enamored by it, and now, when you look at the 57th Street skyline, it gets dwarfed.\u201d\nThe first two sellers out of the building \u2014 one in 2014 and one in 2015 \u2014 netted tidy margins of 11 and 21 percent, respectively. Those sales came right as the condo market began to turn with a glut of inventory, and buyers began eying newer offerings like 432 Park Avenue and 220 Central Park South.\nSince then, a staggering 32 of the next 35 sales by original owners have traded for losses. One57 also has the 10 steepest discounts in absolute dollars of the buildings on this list.\nSome owners did not even try to recoup their losses, and still couldn\u2019t get their asking price. The seller of an 81st-floor unit, who bought the apartment for $55.5 million, listed the home for $42 million in April 2021. It ultimately sold for $35.5 million later that year.\nBut a few bargain hunters who scooped up discounted resale units have managed to turn a profit. Last year, investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Robert Herjavec\nsold his condo for $39 million\nfor a 21 percent gain from what he paid in 2021.\nThe lackluster resales also haven\u2019t discouraged some intrepid owners in the building. The buyer of two 64th-floor units, which cost a total of $46 million, listed the combined full-floor unit for\n$90 million in June\n.\n111 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -16.6 percent)\n217 West 57th Street\n(Average price change: -9.7 percent)\nWe\u2019re lumping together two buildings that can\u2019t quite make it on the resale list on their own because they\u2019re still churning through sponsor sales.\nBoth buildings launched sales in 2018 as the luxury condo market had turned back into a pumpkin.\nAnother Barnett project, 217 West 57th Street, known as Central Park Tower, is what Miller described as the other bookend, along with One57, to the Billionaires\u2019 Row phenomenon.\nThe tower, which was over two-thirds sold in December according to a\nTRD\nanalysis, has become well-known for its hefty sponsor discounts. It has still managed to achieve some of the city\u2019s priciest sales, including a\n$115 million penthouse\nthat closed in June 2024 (don\u2019t ask about the\n$250 million penthouse\n).\nThe building has recorded just three resales, two of which traded at almost exactly their initial sale price. The third,\na $40 million sale in June\n, went for $6 million less than the seller paid only six months prior.\nAt 111 West 57th Street, where the development team of JDS Development and Property Markets Group spent nearly half a decade wading through legal challenges, things have started to turn around under Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nikki Field, who took over sales of the building\u2019s final 27 units last summer.\nThe 59-unit tower was down to its last 10 units in April, likely aided by the aggressive price cuts Field has taken since taking over.\nThe building has seen just two sales by original owners, one of which went for 2 percent over its original sale price of $9.3 million. The other, which the seller bought for $26 million in 2022, was listed for $24.5 million last year and sold for $20.4 million in June.",

        "content": "Most people don\u2019t think of an \u201cemergency\u201d as a permanent condition.\nYet the \u201chousing emergencies\u201d that triggered rent stabilization in New York City and other localities in the state have never ended. Most have lasted for decades.\nUntil now.\nKingston just ran its second housing survey and found a\n7 percent vacancy rate\n, up from\n1.6 percent\nin its initial survey. Under state law, rent stabilization is not allowed if the rate is above 5 percent.\nFans of rent control were incredulous \u2014 and outraged. Sarahana Shrestha, the Hudson Valley\u2019s socialist Assembly member, called it \u201c\nabsolute nonsense\n.\u201d\nBut the study was unquestionably more accurate than the first one, which was rigged to come in under 5 percent. Properties that did not answer the\n2022 survey\nwere assumed to be 100 percent occupied. (Somehow it survived a legal challenge by landlords, whose own survey showed a 6.2 percent vacancy rate.)\nShrestha says vacancy over 5 percent doesn\u2019t mean there is no housing emergency. She authored a bill that would create other justifications for rent regulation. I doubt Gov. Kathy Hochul would sign it, should it somehow pass the legislature.\nKingston is a small city, but what happens with rent stabilization there has implications for landlords and tenants across the state. So, what are the lessons here?\nThe median rent has doubled in Kingston since 2016 because virtually no homes have been built there this century. Only 5 percent of its homes are newer than 25 years old. When demand to live in the Hudson Valley spiked during the pandemic, so did rents.\nKingston\u2019s median home value tripled during the same period. But no one suggested homeowners be prevented from selling to the highest bidder. The city only imposed price caps on landlords.\nThe city has finally taken steps to allow more homes, and developers have responded: More than 600 units are in the pipeline, the most since the 1970s. That is the best way to keep prices down.\nThe 7 percent vacancy rate does not mean Kingston will abandon rent stabilization. Look for the city to apply it to older buildings with 22 or more units, which were found to have a vacancy rate of 3.7 percent.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSomeone on X tweeted that Andrew Cuomo\u2019s proposal for rent stabilization is at least better than the current system. I\nreplied\n, \u201cThat\u2019s like saying swimming with sharks is a better idea than playing in traffic.\u201d Do you agree? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: PTAC stands for packaged terminal air conditioner \u2014 a self-contained heating and cooling unit typically installed through a wall. PTAC units are considered inferior to mini-splits and central air, which are quieter and more efficient (although PTAC technology has improved significantly). Thanks to reader Simone Joy Friedman for sharing the acronym.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nCity Council member Carlina Rivera is the new president and CEO of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing. Rivera represented the 2nd District, covering the Lower East Side and surrounding areas, and was due to be term-limited out at the end of this year.\n\u2014\nAndrew Cuomo refused to release a list of his private consulting clients, citing attorney-client privilege, after Assembly member Zohran Mamdani challenged him to do so in a video linking Cuomo to controversial figures and undisclosed financial dealings,\namNY\nreported. A back-and-forth between the two mayoral candidates began last week when Cuomo criticized Mamdani for living in a $2,300 rent-stabilized apartment despite his $142,000 salary.\n\u2014\nThe MTA is set to award a $1.9 billion contract to Connect Plus Partners to bore tunnels and build two new Harlem stations as part of the extension of the Second Avenue subway,\nCrain\u2019s New York Business\nreported. Construction is set to begin by the end of the year, bringing the Q line further into East Harlem.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10.5 million\nfor 57 Wyckoff Street. The Cobble Hill townhome is 7,000 square feet and last sold in 2022 for $9.4 million. Serhant had the\nlisting\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$125.6 million\nfor a portfolio of units at 569 Lexington Avenue. The City University of New York is\nbuying additional dorm\nspace in Midtown at a former DoubleTree by Hilton hotel, Crain\u2019s reported.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $16.9 million for Unit 5/6 at 969 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op is 4,600 square feet. The Modlin Group has the\nlisting\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 154,188-square-foot, mixed-used building with\n99 units\nand a community facility at 2978 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Yuriy Menzak of Menzak Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Big titles, turnover and dysfunction. Malibu\u2019s revolving door of key staffers could be cause for concern as the community faces recovery from two massive fires.\nFormer Planning Director Richard Mollica resigned last July, replaced by Maureen Tamuri on an interim basis. Tamuri held that spot through June.\nMeanwhile, former City Manager Steve McClary had been away since Thanksgiving \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d when he and the city announced March 11 an \u201camicable transition.\u201d\nIn April, Alexis Brown, who served as an acting deputy city manager, resigned in April, while McClary\u2019s successor Joseph Toney gave notice in May \u201cafter much deliberation and reflection.\u201d\nRonda Perez is now the incoming Malibu city manager, effective Aug. 25, the city announced late last month. She\u2019ll play a key role in the day-to-day operations as the city continues to sort through recovery from the 2018 Woolsey Fire and January\u2019s Palisades Fire.\nPerez hails from about an hour-and-20-minute drive northeast of\nMalibu\n, where she was the former manager of Palmdale and also an assistant city manager of Lancaster. She\u2019s credited with securing state and federal funding for infrastructure projects and parks, in addition to downtown revitalization projects.\nHow that translates to\nwildfire rebuilding\n, developers and residents are watching and waiting to see. So far, no\nbuilding permits\nhave been issued thus far on rebuild projects from the Palisades Fire, which wiped out more than 700 homes.\nIn welcoming Perez, Malibu Mayor Marianne Riggins may have put it best when she said \u201cconsistent and capable leadership is essential\u201d as the city rebuilds.\nPermit race\nSpeaking of getting things done with \u201cconsistent and capable leadership,\u201d one can\u2019t help crunching the numbers here on\npermitting\npost-wildfires, now that the seven-month mark has passed.\nThe numbers, how they\u2019re reported and how often offers one crisp way of gauging government efficiency and\ntransparency\n. Here\u2019s a quick pull of the data:\nMalibu\nHomes Destroyed: 700+\nPermits Issued: 0\nBuilding Plan Check: 1 approved, 7 submissions\nSource: City data as of Aug. 14\nPalisades\nHomes Damaged/Destroyed: 6,200\nPermits Issued: 165+\nSource: City of Los Angeles as of July 7\nAltadena/Pasadena\nHomes Damaged/Destroyed: 6,656\nPermits Issued: 139 (Altadena and other parts of unincorporated L.A. County), 4 (Pasadena)\n\nSource: Pasadena city data, Los Angeles County as of Aug. 14\nBig buyer on the beaches\nAll the resi buzz this week centered on a mystery buyer scooping up burned lots in Malibu.\nSo far, the overseas investor purchased\nnine lots for $65 million\non Carbon and La Costa beaches.\nThe alarm bells started sounding from some locals who were incensed by a single developer buying multiple parcels.\nFor those who have dealt in the past with the permit process, and simply want Malibu rebuilt quickly, the purchases were viewed as welcome deals.\n\u201cIn the news, it was such a negative spin on this developer and how could the city let someone come in and buy all these lots,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Russell Grether. \u201cIt was such a negative tone, but at the same time, to me, it was a vote of confidence that we will recover and there\u2019s somebody out there to have the audacity to not just buy one but [more than] half a dozen [lots].\u201d\nCaruso\u2019s old Beverly Hills pad yields $48M\nIt\u2019s been a little quiet on the big-deal front in Beverly Hills of late.\nRick Caruso\u2019s old pad on Benedict Canyon Drive, about a block away from the Beverly Hills Hotel, broke the silence.\nIn late July, the over 17,000-square-foot new build on\n912 Benedict Canyon Drive\nsold for $47.5 million.\nWestside Estate Agency nabbed business on both sides, with the brokerage\u2019s agents representing the seller and buyer.\nThere\u2019s not a lot more to tell beyond that. Both buyer and seller are hidden behind shell companies. The seller is RFG-Lavender, registered in Delaware. Murray Hill Real Estate LLC is the buyer.\nDubrows get $17M for Beverly Hills French Normandy estate\nHeather and Terry Dubrow\ndidn\u2019t get exactly what they wanted from the sale of their Beverly Hills home, but a lot of sellers aren\u2019t these days.\nThe reality TV couple, known for their roles in \u201cThe Real Housewives of Orange County\u201d and \u201cBotched,\u201d sold 1501 Tower Grove for $16.5 million. The Dubrows tried for $25 million when they hung up the for-sale sign on the nearly 9,000-square-foot residence in March.\nIt\u2019s been a lot of that of late \u2013 homes not selling for close to ask.\nSome agents say it\u2019s a sign of the challenging luxury market. Others say that\u2019s more a function of incorrect initial pricing.\nPay $75M to live in Ricky Martin\u2019s former home\nSpeaking of pricing, Compass\u2019 Carl Gambino will test the luxury market\u2019s appetite for his\n$75 million\nBeverly Hills listing.\nThe property at 1309 Davies Drive hit the market this week. Part of the pitch: the home was owned at different times by Ricky Martin, Michael Caine and the family of Doris Day.\nAside from a glitzy owner lineage, there\u2019s also the possibility of running into any one of the titans of industry that live nearby while out walking the dog.\nThe Pritzker Estate, which Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker is trying to sell for $175 million, is about 10 minutes away. There\u2019s also Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s Bel-Air mansion at 875 Nimes Road, also known as Chartwell Estate.\n",

        "content": "A Nuveen affiliate just made a big bet on suburban Chicago apartments, paying $87.8 million for Uptown La Grange \u2014 the priciest rental property trade in the west suburb\u2019s history.\nNuveen Real Estate\u2019s U.S. Cities Multifamily bought the 254-unit complex at 31 East Ogden Avenue from Oak Brook-based JVM Realty, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The price amounts to $345,700 per unit. It\u2019s the second suburban pickup for the investment manager in less than a year, following its $65 million buy of the 167-unit\nDash Downers Grove\nin October.\nThe sale price is slightly below the $89.4 million JVM paid in 2019. CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi and Jason Zyck repped JVM in the deal. No mortgage was recorded, suggesting Nuveen may have paid cash.\nThe five-story building, completed in 2017, is the only large apartment complex built in La Grange since 1970 and the only Class A asset in the village, CBRE marketing materials said. Units range from studios to three-bedrooms, with average rents of $2,530 per month, or $2.64 per square foot \u2014 above the suburban median of $2.14, per Integra Realty Resources. Suburban Chicago\u2019s apartment market is tight, with 97.8 percent occupancy and rents up 4 percent year-over-year amid high construction costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nInvestors have been circling well-leased suburban rentals as urban rent growth cools. CBRE\u2019s pitch to buyers hinted there\u2019s still room to push rents through upgrades.\nThe deal comes amid other sizable suburban trades:\nValley Lo Towers\nin Glenview fetched $45.5 million in June, while Mount Prospect\u2019s Top of the Mount sold for roughly $60 million in April.\nThe sale is another signal that the institutional capital that once chased urban trophy towers is increasingly looking\noutside\nthe urban core in search of stable income and limited competition.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After eight years of hand wringing, Dallas City Council approved a contentious rezoning plan for 35 acres in West Oak Cliff, a largely Hispanic neighborhood west of downtown.\nThe 12-3 vote Wednesday opened the area up to denser development near Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive, but it\u2019s reigniting fears of displacement in one of the city\u2019s most culturally distinct commercial corridors, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe city-led initiative targeted an area with roughly a quarter of its commercial lots sitting vacant, aiming to attract multifamily and retail development. The measure also bans fast food drive-thrus and caps building heights at 45 feet.\nThe council acted just in time, according to supporters: a new state zoning law,\nSenate Bill 840\n, takes effect Sept. 1, allowing multifamily development on all commercially zoned land in Texas cities. Council Member Chad West, who represents the district, called the rezoning \u201ca long-awaited win\u201d that preserves more local control than the looming state mandate.\nMany locals aren\u2019t buying it. Members of La Alianza, a coalition of corridor business owners, argued that the rezoning will accelerate gentrification, driving out Latino-owned restaurants, auto shops and salons. Residents likened the move to past rezonings in\nBishop Arts\nand Trinity Groves that transformed \u2014 and, in their view, erased \u2014 the character of long-established communities.\n\nAttorney and resident Christine Hopkins said rezoning would invite luxury housing that\u2019s out of step with the working-class neighborhood. But West said that existing businesses will be grandfathered in, with new rules applying only if they expand or relocate.\nThe council adopted two of La Alianza\u2019s three requests \u2014 reducing\nheight limits\nand a ground-floor retail requirement \u2014 but stopped short of creating an anti-displacement task force. West said he\u2019s working with City Manager Kim Tolbert to form one.\nThe rezoning won backing from five of six neighborhood associations in the area. William Roth, one of three council members who voted no, said he\u2019s worried about residents losing influence over the future of their neighborhood.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two value haircuts and a discounted sale. That\u2019s the news out of a distressed Los Angeles office sector.\nLet\u2019s start downtown, where it hurts the most.\nThe 21-story Wedbush Center was recently\nappraised\nat $60.5 million compared with a $197.5 million value at loan issuance. That\u2019s a 69 percent decrease in seven years, meaning the office tower is worth less than half the $128 million debt connected to it and less than the $196 million Cerberus Capital Management purchased it for.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities debt backing the Class A offices at 1000 Wilshire Boulevard landed in special servicing after missing a March maturity date. Occupancy has slumped at the 475,000-square-foot office building, to 67 percent at the end of last year compared to 87 percent at loan underwriting.\nAnd although the special servicer is reviewing resolution alternatives, the vacancy rate may worsen at the Wedbush Center. The building\u2019s largest tenant, that shares its name, plans to vacate the premises once its lease expires at the end of the year: Wedbush Securities is ditching its 100,000 square feet of space after two decades.\nEyes on the clock\nNow to Santa Monica. The Santa Monica Clock Tower was recently\nappraised\nat $27.4 million compared to $49 million at loan issuance. That\u2019s a 44 percent drop in around a decade and puts the office tower\u2019s value under the $58 million Rockwood Capital paid for it six years ago.\nThe value drop comes after the $26.7 million CMBS loan connected to the offices went to special servicing after missing a May maturity date. But because the borrower is responsive and the value is still above the debt balance, there may be room for modification.\nOnce the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper, the century-old, 12-story Art Deco office property, has seen its occupancy plummet to 43 percent in March this year versus 100 percent at loan underwriting ten years ago. The 53,500-square-foot office building at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard is not bringing in enough money to pay off debts.\nOn sale\nAnd our last stop: Pasadena.\n\nSwift Real Estate Partners\nsold\na nine-story office tower to GD Realty at about an 47 percent loss, for $31.5 million.\nThe property at 790 East Colorado Boulevard was part of a three-building office complex in Pasadena that Swift Real Estate partners purchased for $193 million six years ago. The offices at 790 East Colorado Boulevard were purchased for $59 million, property records reveal. The 146,000-square-foot office building is 70 percent leased.\nThe three properties were collectively known as \u201cThe Pasadena Collection,\u201d and span 517,000 square feet. The two other properties were a 212,000 square-foot building at 155 North Lake Avenue, and a 159,000 square-foot building at 35 North Lake Avenue.\nSlam dunk\nBasketball brothers-turned-developers\nscored\n$46.6 million in construction financing for an apartment development in Echo Park.\nNBA star Tobais Harris, who plays for the Detroit Pistons, and Visionary Developments\u2019 Terry Harris, who played in a developmental league, secured senior and mezzanine debt from JP Morgan and BlueHub Capital.\nThe development totals about 86,500 square feet. The 189 apartments at 1540 West Court Street are deed-restricted at 80 percent, meaning households can only earn up to 80 percent of the median income; in Los Angeles County that would be $84,500 for a single person, $96,950 for two and so on \u2014 and the project benefits from Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1, which aims to streamline the approval process for affordable housing.\nThe Harris brothers have two other Echo Park apartment developments: one at 1230 West Sunset Boulevard that is under planning review and another at 333 Douglas Street that is under construction.\nStalled project finds suiters\nThe bankrupt, half-baked Oceanwide Plaza at the center of Downtown Los Angeles has two bidders,\naccording to\nits broker, Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski. Both bidders are developers, one is from abroad.\nAfter would-be buyers couldn\u2019t come up with the cash, Tarczynski says they now have to show money to talk. That means $450 million to purchase the entitled site and $1 billion to complete it. That\u2019s despite the $1.2 billion that was spent on construction.\n\u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d Tarczynski said.\nConstruction on the unfinished, mixed-use, 1.5-million-square-foot project covered in graffiti began a decade ago. It became two half-built towers before landing in bankruptcy due to financial issues. Everything has been on hold since January 2019; the project faced foreclosure in 2023 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year.\nBut Tarczynski anticipates the deal to close by the end of the year \u2014 although he had previously hoped it would happen before the second quarter.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy win\nA Los Angeles judge\nfound in favor\nof developer Leo Pustilnikov after he sued Beverly Hills for attempting to block a 19-story mixed-use development on Linden Drive.\nThe proposed project, which includes apartments, hotel rooms and a restaurant, was one of the first in Beverly Hills to put builder\u2019s remedy to use. The legal mechanism allows developers to bypass local planning boards and zoning when localities\u2019 housing plans fail to comply with state-mandated goals.\nThe ruling could have an effect on other housing developments that have been proposed in recent years through builder\u2019s remedy, but were still held up by the city.\n\u201cThis puts the wind at our back and sends a message clear as day. The city cannot rely on specious legal arguments to delay and deny a developer\u2019s vested rights.\u201d Dave Rand, an attorney for Pustilnikov, said.\n",

        "content": "It was a tale of two office markets in New York this week.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue\nreceived a valuation\nof $41 million, a significant drop from its $300 million valuation in 2015. The building\u2019s occupancy and net operating income have declined, leading to a foreclosure case.\nCohen\u2019s personal net worth has decreased in parallel and his troubles continue as he faces a separate $187 million judgment from Fortress Capital.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Scott Rechler closed a\n$1 billion deal\nfor 590 Madison Avenue with a big private equity loan, New York City\u2019s largest investment sale in three years. Mark Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management provided $785 million in debt to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of the Plaza District office tower from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nThere was some drama, as Rechler signed a contract to buy the building in May, with a closing deadline set for July 31. RXR needed more time to lock in financing and received a two-week extension, for which the company had to pay a $5 million fee that was added onto the final purchase price.\nIn a major moment for New York City development, the NYC City Council approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan,\nrezoning\n42 blocks.\n\nThis is the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years, projected to add 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 designated as affordable. The rezoning introduces new residential districts and utilizes Mandatory Inclusionary Housing for the first time in Midtown Manhattan, part of Eric Adams\u2019 Manhattan Plan.\nOn the Upper West Side, UDR and MetLife are\nlooking to sell\na five-building, 710-unit multifamily portfolio near Columbus Circle for $450 million to $500 million.\nThe portfolio is being marketed as resistant to potential rent freezes due to four buildings being free market and the fifth having significant rent increase potential under the 421a program, an intriguing offering for investors amid concerns about Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments.\nAnd finally, Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s YS Developers\nis moving ahead\nwith a controversial project at 960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, planning 300 condo units with a projected sellout of $273 million. The seven-story building will include one to two-bedroom condos, with prices starting under $600,000 for a one-bedroom and reaching approximately $1.6 million for a two-bedroom on the top floor.\nThe development comes after years of disputes and rejected proposals for the site, including earlier plans by Bruce Eichner for significantly taller towers that were opposed due to concerns about shadowing the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\n",

        "content": "Despite institutional investors lining up to sell downtown Chicago apartment towers amid solid rent growth, there\u2019s plenty of CRE distress in the pipeline.\nMoshe Wechsler\u2019s\nEmerald Empire is in forbearance\non a big chunk of debt tied to a $600 million purchase of Pangea Properties\u2019 400-building rental portfolio. The 2022 deal made Emerald one of Chicago\u2019s largest apartment landlords, but rising interest rates and shaky property conditions preceded the landlord\u2019s request for a break on payments toward $430 million in Fannie Mae financing. City officials have flagged multiple code violations at Emerald\u2019s buildings, while it remains unclear exactly how much of the large debt package is affected.\nElsewhere in multifamily,\nChikoo Patel and partner Shai Wolkowicki are under siege\nfrom lenders and investors for nearly $20 million tied to deals from Chicago to Springfield. Patel, who drew tenant ire earlier this year over property conditions in South Shore, is accused of fraud and embezzlement in one case while Old National Bank is pursuing foreclosure on a $16 million downstate deal. Other lawsuits are stacking up, from HUD-funded projects to smaller South Side apartments, spotlighting the\nrisks of opportunistic plays\nin distressed housing.\n\nIn the South Loop,\nlender ACORE Capital filed a $187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst longtime hotel operator Su-Mei Yen, whose family controls the Best Western Grant Park and the Homewood Suites on Wabash. The suit alleges missed deposits and unpaid fees on a loan that\u2019s now swelling by $60,000 a day. Additionally,\nChinese EB-5 investors expanded a fraud lawsuit against the Yens to $18 million\n, claiming their funds were misused and their visa hopes derailed.\nIt\u2019s brighter in the residential market of Lake Geneva, where wealthy buyers are circling waterfront homes \u2014 even when\nthey\u2019re off the market\n. A six-bedroom home in the Wisconsin getaway\u2019s South Shore Club sold after an\nunsolicited $10.1 million offer\nended the buyer\u2019s two-year search. It\u2019s the latest in a string of eight-figure trades on the lake, underscoring the\nMidwest\u2019s strengthening pull for trophy-home buyers\n.\nPlus, downtown Chicago\u2019s high-rise multifamily market is a magnet.\nBrookfield listed its 502-unit Sky55\nand an adjacent senior building on South Michigan Avenue, while the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio\nput its 481-unit Streeterville tower on the block\n. Both properties are heavily occupied with rising rents, joining other large complexes recently listed as\ninstitutional players test pricing\nin a supply-starved market.",

        "content": "Fitness plays into real estate almost as much as it does into having a snatched waist.\nConsider Related Company\u2019s ownership of luxury fitness concept\nEquinox\n, which also operates SoulCycle and Blink Fitness. There\u2019s also\npickleball\nfrenzy, and private\npadel courts\npopping up in places like Billionaire\u2019s Row in New York City.\nIn Texas, fitness and entertainment concepts have kept\nretail real estate vacancy\nat historic lows, while major retailers like Big Lots, Conn\u2019s and Joanns folded.\nThe vacancy rate halfway through the year was lower than the 20-year historic average in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Partners Real Estate.\nAmong the big backfillers is Dallas-based EoS Fitness, which was\nfounded in 2014\nbut has blown up in the past few years. It has 175 locations across the country and plans to expand to 250 gyms by 2030. The company was acquired by San Francisco private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in May.\nEoS is redeveloping a 45,000-square-foot former Fiesta Mart store at 8040 Ferguson Road in Dallas, and it had four other projects in the works across Texas last year, according to Weitzman.\nFitness is also the hook for Houston-based apartment developer Define Living. The firm, led by CEO and founder Henry Richardson, bought one of the last undeveloped parcels in\nHouston\u2019s Energy Corridor\n. The firm is planning a 388-unit complex on the 10.2-acre tract, which it bought from Wolff Companies. The four-story complex will be built near planned city trails and include a gym, infrared sauna, cold plunge, bicycle spa and \u201ca personal wellbeing coach for every resident.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, brokers are getting in their reps within the fitness sector.\nElsewhere in Texas real estate this week\u2026\nAshford Hospitality Trust, led by Dallas investor Monty Bennett, is facing financial distress after defaulting on a\n$590 million hotel portfolio loan\n, failing to secure refinancing before a forbearance period expired. The 18-property portfolio, primarily in Texas, has seen declining occupancy and has been in and out of special servicing since 2020. Although Ashford recently received a loan extension until January and the portfolio was appraised at $1.1 billion, its financial challenges persist amid ongoing efforts to refinance.\nSterling Bay abandoned its plans for a $100 million, 13-story office project in Deep Ellum after\nselling the 2.7-acre site\nto an unidentified entity called Dos Hombres Ventures. The Chicago-based developer, facing mounting financial challenges and setbacks with its Lincoln Yards project, has been offloading real estate, including multiple properties in Chicago.\nAustin-based developer American Ventures is proposing a $557 million, 100-acre\nmixed-use project in San Marcos\nand is seeking city support through a public improvement district, zoning changes and potential tax abatements. The development would include more than 1,600 residential units, a hotel and more than 140,000 square feet of office and retail space, with completion planned by 2031.\nA 1,000-home master-planned community called Holly Ridge is being developed in rural Fort Bend County, about 7 miles west of Rosenberg, by\nSignorelli Company and D.R. Horton\n. Spanning 359 acres, the project will offer homes priced between $300,000 and $450,000 and include 133 acres of outdoor amenities. It reflects a broader trend of developers expanding into the outer edges of the Houston metro area amid a slowdown in master-planned community sales.\nActress Emma Stone sold her\nrenovated seven-bedroom mansion in Austin\u2019s Tarrytown\nneighborhood without ever moving in, choosing instead to remain in New York City with her husband, Dave McCary. The couple bought the 1.24-acre property off-market in 2021 with plans to relocate but changed course, listing it for $26.5 million before cutting the price to $23.5 million. If sold at the asking price, it would rank among the most expensive residential sales in Austin.\n",

        "content": "The cycle for new multifamily construction is ending, and owners of multifamily development sites are looking for an out.\nIt makes sense. Many developers are putting their sites up for sale following a period of rapid growth fueled by the pandemic boom. Then came the slowdown, brought by unsustainable costs for land, financing and construction.\nOn top of that, developers have to offer more concessions to tenants to lease units at their buildings, commercial broker Tony Arellano\ntells Lidia Dinkova\n. A deluge of completed projects in 2023 and 2024 suppressed rent growth. And rents are falling in some neighborhoods.\nDevelopers deny that high costs are why they\u2019re listing their sites.\n\u201cSome of these guys bought at the top of the market. They were overleveraged, and they thought everything ws going to keep being peachy, that the rents would be peachy, that with Trump being in power, interest rates would have dropped,\u201d said Miguel Pinto of Apex Capital Realty. \u201cNone of that has happened.\u201d\nAnd not all of them are publicly listing their sites. But they would sell if the price makes sense.\nSebastian Faerman, a commercial broker at Fortune Christie\u2019s, said developers who didn\u2019t have shovels in the ground a couple of months ago will not be going vertical this cycle.\nStill, some of the properties are owned by land-bankers who never planned to actually build. Their business model is to buy, entitle and flip \u2014 this includes those tapping the state\u2019s new workforce housing law, the Live Local Act, to boost their site\u2019s density and height allowance.\nIn Wynwood, Clara Homes listed its site, home to the former Austin Burke menswear store, for nearly $11 million. Clara paid $7.7 million for the nearly half-acre site, filed plans for a Live Local project, and secured approval for the 22-story, 147-unit tower. But Clara, led by James Curnin, switched course with the listing.\nCurnin agreed that Wynwood has high inventory, but he said that\u2019s not why he listed the Clara Wynwood site. He also cited issues with a strung-out site plan approval process, one many developers complain about.\n\u201cI just want to move to bigger and better things,\u201d said Curnin.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nBillionaire Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow (and partners) took a\nmajority stake\nin Chetrit Group\u2019s Miami River development, one megaproject we\u2019ve been tracking for a decade. What does this deal say about the market? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Patrick K. Willis sold a single-family home at 2900 Northeast 37th Street in Fort Lauderdale\nfor $27.4 million\nto former race car driver and racing company owner Michael Andretti. Willis, who owns a repo company, paid $12.5 million for the nearly 14,000-square-foot mansion in 2021.\nCommercial\n: Private credit firm Favo Capital\npaid $190 million\nfor the 22-story, 277-unit apartment tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. GCF Development, a Hollywood-based firm led by Charles \u201cChip\u201d Abele, obtained a long-term equity stake in Favo as part of the all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nSpec home developer Todd Michael Glaser and the Posner Group are looking to flip for\n$169 million\nthe waterfront Miami Beach estate they bought for $105 million in July. They also listed the 2.3-acre estate at 5940 North Bay Road for rent, asking $495,000 a month. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listings. Glaser could sell or rent the existing home as is, but he is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nFlorida\u2019s population will likely surpass 24 million by 2027, but overall growth is expected to slow within the next few years, according to a\nreport\nby the Demographic Estimating Conference. The state\u2019s population hit 23 million people last year.\nElsewhere in Florida\nMiami real estate agent Leila Alessandra Trinchero was arrested after police said she slapped a 72-year-old man and another woman during a dispute over a chair at the new Eataly food hall at Aventura Mall, sending him to the hospital,\nChannel 10 reports\n. Trinchero is licensed with AvantiWay Realty. The older man was trying to break up the fight between Trinchero and another woman.\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced plans to convert a vacant North Florida prison into an immigration detention center for more than 1,000 people, calling it \u201cdeportation depot.\u201d The move comes as a federal judge considers shutting down the state\u2019s controversial Alligator Alcatraz facility over environmental concerns, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nFort Lauderdale overtook Miami as Florida\u2019s most sought-after rental market, ranking No. 1 in the state and No. 20 nationally, according to a RentCafe report cited by the\nSun Sentinel\n.\nHurricane Erin, which became a Category 5 storm over the weekend, marks the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season.

Earlier this month, a judge approved a request to extend a court-appointed receiver\u2019s ability to sell the properties until Oct. 29, marking the fourth time the sale deadline has been extended.\nThe past year has been rough, to say the least, for\nhotels across the Bay Area\ntrying to stay afloat as foreclosures and loan defaults abound.\nLast month, lender Invesco took back the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\nin a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million, or $140,400 per key. That was preceded in May by\nBrightSpire Capital\u2019s seizure\nof the 541-room Signia by Hilton in downtown\nSan Jose\nin a foreclosure valuing the property at $80 million, under $148,000 per key. In October, the 162-room Courtyard Oakland Downtown sold for $10.6 million, just $65,400 per key and a 76 percent drop from its prior value.\nForeclosure claimed the 142-room\nHyatt House Pleasant Hill\nin June, while the 128-room Hyatt House Pleasanton was seized through foreclosure the month prior. In April, the dual-branded AC Hotel and Residence Inn in downtown Oakland went back to lenders in a streamlined foreclosure process after Hawkins Way Capital defaulted on a $112 million loan tied to the property. At the same time, the 112-room Hyatt Place/Newark Silicon Valley is in default and could be taken by its lender through a foreclosure.\nIn Berkeley, Kubera Hotel Properties\u2019 113-room\nUniversity Inn &amp; Suites in Berkeley\nwent into foreclosure in June. Down south in San Jose, a two-hotel complex consisting of a Motel 6 and a Super 8 by Wyndham defaulted on a $21.7 million loan.\nSome hotels have closed their doors entirely. Last summer, the\nHilton Oakland Airport Hotel\nshut down abruptly, while in January, the 145-room Waterfront Hotel in Oakland\u2019s Jack London Square also suddenly shuttered. The Radisson Oakland Airport has also permanently closed.\nHotel sales\nin California dropped 7.4 percent in the first six months of the year from the same period the year prior, according to Atlas Hospitality Group. In the Bay Area, the largest hotel sales in Alameda County and Santa Clara County in the first half of the year were foreclosure sales: The Oakland Marriott City Center and Signia by Hilton in San Jose.\nMark Zuckerberg\nangers neighbors\nResidents of Palo Alto\u2019s Crescent Park neighborhood are hopping mad at neighbor Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe Meta CEO dropped more than $110 million on at least 11 houses next to each other in the tree-filled neighborhood since moving there in 2011. He constructed a compound across five of those parcels, while other buildings are used for things like parties and an unpermitted private school. Underground, Zuckerberg and his family have access to 7,000 square feet of so-called basement space, which neighbors regard as a bunker.\nZuckerberg\u2019s neighbors are\nspeaking out\nabout their experiences sharing their environment with one of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\u201cNo neighborhood wants to be occupied,\u201d neighbor Michael Kieschnick, whose home is tucked between Zuckerberg-owned lots,\ntold\nthe New York Times. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood.\u201d\nThe city of Palo Alto has seemingly allowed Zuckerberg\u2019s unfettered expansion in the area, purportedly going so far as to let him get around local regulations and even have police block off street parking used by residents.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been finding loopholes around our local laws and zoning ordinances,\u201d Greer Stone, a member of the Palo Alto City Council, told the outlet. \u201cWe should never be a gated, gilded city on a hill where people don\u2019t know their neighbors.\u201d\nKirschnick put it more bluntly: \u201cBillionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules \u2014 Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique, except that they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a mystery why the city has been so feckless.\u201d\nGSA closes office campus sale\n\nThe General Services Administration has completed its sale of the\nRockaway Grove\noffice campus in Menlo Park.\nSan Francisco-based developer Presidio Bay bought the 17-acre property, previously occupied by the U.S. Geological Survey, for $137 million. The sale comes as the GSA is reducing office space across the country following the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s headcount cuts at federal government agencies.\nPresidio Bay is floating a mixed-use development for the site. The campus could accommodate 600 to 1,000 units of housing and 600,000 to 800,000 square feet of commercial space. The city of Menlo Park is required to permit nearly 3,000 new units of housing before 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n.\nPalo Alto offices sell at pre-pandemic price\nThe sale price for a downtown Palo Alto office building is reminiscent of pre-pandemic glory days.\nFirst Citizens Bank &amp; Trust\nbought the offices\nat 250 University Avenue for $82 million. The sale by Inspire Real Estate Holdings works out to $1,969 per square foot. The building spans four stories across 38,000 square feet.\nIn downtown Palo Alto, other office buildings that sold for similar per-square-foot prices before the pandemic include 192 Lytton Avenue for $23.1 million, or $2,551 a square foot; 530 Lytton Avenue for $117.5 million, or $2,156 a square foot; 150 Forest Avenue for $26 million, or $2,153 a square foot; and 385 Sherman Avenue for $138 million, or $2,030 a square foot.\nOffice property sales in Palo Alto in recent years have ranged from lows, like Hudson Pacific Properties\u2019 sale last year of an office campus\n4001-4009 Miranda Avenue\nfor $23 million, or about $126 per square foot, to highs like the 2023 purchase of\n2555 Park Boulevard\nin south Palo Alto for $58 million, or about $2,000 per square foot.\nSantana Row prepares to sell more apartments\nAnother apartment complex at San Jose\u2019s Santana Row is headed for the market.\nFederal Realty Investment Trust is preparing to list the 212-unit Misora luxury apartment complex for sale. It would follow a transaction in May in which Hines bought the 108-unit\nLevare\napartment complex in Santana Row for $73.9 million, or $348,600 per unit.\nMisora was built in 2014 and spans 222,000 square feet. It features\namenities\nlike a lap pool, lounging pool, spa, fireplace lounge, rooftop deck and outdoor barbecue and dining space. If Misora sells for a similar per-unit price as Levare, it would total more than $145 million.\nHousing construction at Santana Row isn\u2019t slowing down. Last month, Federal Realty announced\nplans for a 258-unit apartment complex\nat 358 Hatton Street, making it the first new housing development at Santana Row in a decade.\nPebble Beach manse sets Monterey County record\nA three-story estate in Pebble Beach\nset a record\n.\nThe ocean-view mansion at 1522 Riata Road sold for $18.1 million, or $2,498 per square foot, making it the highest-value transaction in the seaside county so far this year. The home was listed for under $12 million in 2022. It topped out other high-end purchases in the county including a Carmel Highlands estate that sold in June for $14.8 million, a home in Carmel that sold for $15.5 million that same month, and another Carmel estate in April that was bought for $17.5 million.\nBuilt in 1927, the record-setting home sits on a 2.2-acre lot and spans 7,250 square feet with a four-car garage and views of the Pacific Ocean and Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nAs of June, the median listing home price in Pebble Beach was $3.5 million, representing an 8 percent drop year-over-year. The median sale price was $2.8 million with homes spending about 10 weeks on the market.\n",

        "content": "Among the top listings sold in Houston last month, the most expensive home was also the oldest.\nA 1938 mansion at 2110 River Oaks Boulevard was asking $18.9 million when it sold on July 31, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. That\u2019s $11 million more than the second-highest listing, a 2024 build in Piney Point Village. The asking price amounted to $2,004 per square foot. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nLaura Sweeney of Compass represented the buyers, philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade, according to property records. Long is the daughter of Cornelia Long and the late Meredith Long, who was a well-known gallerist. Sweeney also represented the seller, the estate of the late Larry Brookshire.\n\nThe 1.6-acre gated estate includes the 9,400-square-foot main house, remodeled in 2000, and two other dwellings that were built in 2012: a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom guest apartment over the garage, and a 1,000-square-foot \u201centertainment pavilion\u201d by the pool.\nThe house is in the River Oaks Country Club Estate subdivision, anchored by the eponymous golf club founded a little over a century ago. River Oaks frequently takes the top spot for luxury sales in Houston; in May, one street in the River Oaks neighborhood,\nInverness Drive,\naccounted for $23 million in sales. Two of the three\nmost expensive single-family homes for rent\nin Houston in July were in River Oaks. The third most-expensive home in Houston last month was an 8,400-square-foot mid-century modern house at 2411 River Oaks Boulevard, which was asking $7.8 million, or $919 per square foot, when it sold on July 14.\nSweeney also\nsold the most expensive Houston home in March\n, a European-inspired estate at 19 West Lane in Montrose.Residential developments underway in River Oaks include a\nSt. Regis condo project\nat 102 Asbury Street, the brand\u2019s first purely residential development in Texas, and the RO, a Transwestern development that will include an Auberge Resorts Collection hotel.\n",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank hasn\u2019t been happy with billionaire landlord Joel Wiener.\nThe bank has accused Wiener of mismanaging his properties and disputed the expert appraisals of their value. The allegations have shined a light on some of the issues that could be coming to the Israeli bond market, which Wiener tapped for cheap financing.\nFlagstar made the allegations in a bankruptcy case involving Wiener\u2019s 82 property entities, which owe more than $1.1 billion to Flagstar and Israeli bondholders, according to court documents. Together, the companies control 93 New York apartment buildings and more than 5,200 units.\nWiener\u2019s entities want to use rental income to cover their operating expenses. But Flagstar has strenuously objected. The properties haven\u2019t paid their mortgages since January and many are facing foreclosure. The bank said in May it has serious concerns about where money is going, questioning whether Wiener\u2019s role included \u201csimple mismanagement of the debtors\u2019 properties, or worse.\u201d\nAn attorney for Wiener did not offer a comment for this article. Flagstar did not respond to requests for comment.\nFlagstar has also raised alarms about the flow of funds at the businesses. The businesses paid Israeli bondholders $12 million, the bank alleged, while not paying their mortgages.\n\u201cSignificantly flawed and not credible\u201d\nWiener was among the first New York real estate players to tap into the Israeli bond market for financing, raising more than\n$500 million\n. His bankruptcy case has highlighted another player in that market: Michelle Zell, an appraiser for Bowery Valuation.\nZell, who says she\u2019s valued properties for Israeli bond issuances totalling more than $1 billion, is serving as the companies\u2019 expert witness in the bankruptcy case. In the case of the 93 New York buildings in Wiener\u2019s portfolio, she has argued the properties are worth more than their debt.\nFlagstar\u2019s expert cast doubt on Zell\u2019s determinations, calling her report \u201csignificantly flawed and not credible.\u201d Appraiser Scott Fowler of Ankura Real Estate Advisory said her report was based on \u201cunsupported, incorrect or inappropriate data.\u201d\n\nZell\u2019s response was filed under seal, but the judge in the case said she was \u201ca well-qualified valuation expert who presented generally reasonable analyses.\u201d She did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nNew York real estate dealmakers who tapped into the\u00a0 Israeli bond market notably saw several defaults in the last decade.\nBrooklyn developer Yoel Goldman was the subject of a criminal investigation in Israel after his All Year Management unraveled under high leverage, declaring bankruptcy. He reached a settlement with the Israel Securities Authority, but was\nbanned from raising money\nin the country for five years.\nStarwood Capital drew a class action lawsuit from Israeli pensioners for allegedly misleading investors after it defaulted on a $254 million bond. Starwood said the allegations were meritless, but agreed to the appointment of a receiver, according to\nCoStar\n.\nIn a separate unrelated case, Zell is facing direct allegations that she misappraised property. Investment firm Saluda Grade alleged it purchased a $13.7 million loan for a 40-building apartment complex in southeast Texas after Zell and a colleague valued it at $18.4 million. But once the borrower defaulted, Saluda Grade got a second opinion. That review placed the retrospective value at just $5.8 million, a 68 percent difference.\n\u201cThe appraisal was so bad that the appraiser defendants\u2019 agent only inspected one building out of the forty buildings that made up the development being appraised!\u201d the lender wrote in its complaint.\nElsewhere in the bankruptcy case, Flagstar has taken issue with the companies\u2019 effort to pay management fees to other Wiener-controlled businesses. Experts say payroll expenses at the property entities are unusually high at the LLCs, according to court documents.\n\u201cDebtors pay a 4% management fee to an insider even though their own expert assumed that a 3% fee was more typical,\u201d a judge wrote in June.\nIn June, a federal judge denied the Wiener\u2019s companies\u2019 efforts to use rental cash to cover expenses, saying Flagstar\u2019s interests as a secured creditor were not protected. But he urged Flagstar to work something out with the companies on an interim basis, given that the living conditions of thousands of tenants were on the line. The parties have agreed to the use of cash for a period of a few months.\n",

        "content": "Two Brownstone Brooklyn townhouses asking over $10 million scored contracts last week.\nThe first, a 6,500-square-foot home asking $14.5 million, was Park Slope\u2019s most expensive listing at the time it went into contract. It was one of 20 homes that went into contract between Aug. 11 and Aug. 18, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed on homes asking at least $2 million.\nThose homes had a total contract volume of $83 million, up the previous week from $59 million.\nIt first earned the title of priciest listing when it hit the market asking $18 million in May 2024 with Brown Harris Stevens.\nThe sellers, Jeanne and Dennis Masel, cut the price at the start of this year to $17 million before re-listing it with Compass\u2019 Tim Malone at $16.5 million in April and dropping the price again to $14.5 million at the end of May.\nIf it sells for its last asking price, it would still claim Park Slope\u2019s most expensive townhouse sale. That record currently belongs to\n53 Prospect Park West, which sold for $13.5 million\nin December 2023 after initially asking $30 million when it hit the market in 2021.\nThe five-story home at 535 1st Street has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The Masels, who bought the home for nearly $6 million in 2007, undertook a four-year renovation beginning in 2018 with Leroy Street Studio.\nThe garden level features a chef\u2019s kitchen with an 18-foot marble island and a sunken den with a gas fireplace and direct garden access. The parlor level has a living room with a second gas fireplace, an open library with glass walls looking out to the backyard and a private screening room.\n\nThe third floor is dedicated to the primary suite, which has a walk-in dressing room, private terrace and en-suite bathroom. The top floor has more living space with retractable glass walls leading to two terraces.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a Cobble Hill townhouse at 57 Wyckoff Street in an off-market deal. The sale closed for $10.45 million, according to public records.\nThe five-story, 25-foot wide townhouse features five beds, four full bathrooms and spans 6,000 square feet. The home comes with a large back garden and a hot tub on the top floor roof deck, according to a previous listing.\nThe home previously sold for $9.4 million in 2022, after originally hitting the market asking $14 million in 2021.\nSerhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha and Cameron LeCates had the listing. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Aran Scott brought the buyer.\nThere were eight contracts signed for condos and 12 for houses last week, which had a combined median asking price of $3 million and average price per square foot of $1,494.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Brooklyn is on track for a record-breaking year in housing development.\nAccording to a new report from the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership\u2019s real estate team, the neighborhood is slated for its highest number of new units yet,\nCrain\u2019s New York Business\nreported.\nDuring the first six months of the year, Downtown Brooklyn saw more than 3,700 units completed, with another 1,183 set to be finished before the end of 2025. This breaks the area\u2019s previous record of 2,925 units completed in 2022.\nOf those units, 3,334 were finished between April and the end of June, with 1,048 designated as affordable. Those units make up 12 percent of the 26,853 units built since the neighborhood was rezoned in 2004 to spur office construction, expand academic facilities and add residential and retail projects.\n\u201cThis is the constant evolution of Downtown Brooklyn,\u201d Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, told the publication. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible trajectory.\u201d\nThis evolution will likely stay on an upward trajectory, Myer said. The recent passage of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 rezoning initiative, is expected to add 82,000 new housing units to the city over the next 15 years.\n\nIn fact, a\nTRD analysis\nof new building permits filed with the New York City Department of Buildings between June 2024 and 2025 found that Downtown Brooklyn tops the city for new units in the pipeline.\nThe report outlines 12 projects set to begin construction, bringing 2,246 housing units \u2014 437 of them affordable \u2014 along with 73,100 square feet of retail. Another 25 projects are in the works for the coming year and beyond, adding at least 4,412 more housing units, including 1,098 affordable.\nAmong those projects is the recently announced rezoning of\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\n, which would pave the way for a 1.5-million-square-foot residential tower with 1,263 apartments; 253 to 379 of them will be affordable.\nWhile housing in the neighborhood is going strong, a recent report found that office leasing volume is\nflagging\nas the demand for office space is still catching up to the oversupply built in the last 20 years.\n\u2013 Quinn Waller\n",

The new structure would feature 195,000 square feet of offices, 6,393 square feet of ground-floor retail and an 809-car garage next door.\nConstruction was set to begin as early as this year but the developer has yet to complete the entitlement process. City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez introduced a motion to begin a general plan amendment and zone change for the site that would allow high-rise housing units in at least a portion of the proposed office space.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be Onni Group\u2019s first rodeo trying to turn an office-dominant project into a partial residential development.\nIn April, the firm filed plans to build an all-residential tower complex in the Arts District in place of a project that previously included nearly 200,000 square feet of offices. In 2023, it sought a\nsimilar conversion in Glendale\nto turn a proposed hotel project into housing.\n\nElsewhere in downtown,\nJamison Properties\nis preparing to begin the redevelopment of the nearly 610,000-square-foot L.A. Care building at 1055 West 7th Street into 691 luxury residences.\nOnni Group\u2019s new development comes as the Los Angeles office market faces an uphill battle toward recovery post-pandemic. Office vacancy in the Greater L.A. area ticked up to 24.4 percent last quarter, according to\nColliers\n\u2019 Q2 report.\nEarlier this year, the Los Angeles City Council aimed to boost office-to-residential conversions in the city by\noverhauling zoning and adaptive reuse regulations\nand providing incentives for developers to create 43,000 new housing units.\nAcross the country, office-to-residential conversions have never been more popular. As of this year, there are nearly 71,000 units set to be redeveloped from offices, according to\nRentCafe\n. It\u2019s a new record and represents a tripling of the number of units in the works three years ago. Office-to-residential plans nationwide make up 42 percent of future conversion projects, up from 38 percent last year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago is about to lose one of its quirkiest cultural gems.\nThe Klairmont Kollections Automotive Museum, a two-story trove of nearly 300 vintage cars stashed in a half-mile-long warehouse in Belmont Cragin, will close next month, and hundreds of vehicles and thousands of memorabilia pieces headed to the auction block.\nThe late Larry Klairmont, founder of Imperial Realty and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in World War II, spent decades amassing the fleet, starting with a 1951 Rolls-Royce in the 1960s, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. His buying ramped up over the years to a point where he was \u201cbuying cars by the dozens,\u201d his son Alfred Klairmont, CEO of Imperial Realty, told the outlet.\nBy the time Klairmont died in 2021, the collection had morphed into a private museum that opened to the public in 2019, showcasing everything from a gold-leaf Pierce Arrow to a crystal-encrusted Rolls-Royce, plus a replica Batmobile and even a Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.\n\nMecum Auctions \u2014 known for selling the Porsche 917K Steve McQueen drove in the 1971 film\nLe Mans\nfor $25 million and the Mustang McQueen drove in the 1968 film\nBullitt\nfor $3.74 million \u2014 is set to handle the sale Sept. 19 to 21. The no-reserve auction will feature 275 vehicles and more than 1,000 pieces of road art, with previews earlier that week. Dubbed \u201cLarry\u2019s Legacy Auction,\u201d highlights include the Golden Sahara II, a 1956 futuristic prototype with glowing Goodyear tires, and a 1926 Rickenbacker Eight Super Sport believed to be the last of its kind.\nFor years, the museum was hidden in plain sight inside an unassuming brick industrial building at 3117 North Knox Avenue in\nBelmont Cragin\n. Visitors stepping inside were met with aisles of pristine Cadillacs, Corvettes, Lamborghinis and race cars, plus neon signs, full size replica model planes and a Ronald McDonald statue.\nWhile bidders worldwide will now get a chance to take home a slice of Klairmont\u2019s eccentric empire, the auction also marks the end of a real estate play that turned a forgotten warehouse into a Chicago oddity. Proceeds will go toward a foundation in Klairmont\u2019s name, funding youth education programs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The most recent roster of departees included Jamba Juice, Izzy &amp; Wooks sandwich shop, Mija Cochinita taco shop, Mai Savory Hot Dogs, a Fires of Brazil barbecue spot and Blondie\u2019s Pizza.\nOnly a few restaurants remain on the premises; kitchen equipment was gone from all the former tenants\u2019 food stands.

A foreclosure auction for the mall has been delayed a half-dozen times, with the most recent date scheduled next week on Aug. 21.\nThe mall has seen a steep drop in foot traffic as fewer stores bring in fewer customers. Between 2019 and 2024, foot traffic at San Francisco Centre fell 63.3 percent, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. From January to May of this year, foot traffic at the mall was down 68 percent from the same period in 2019 and between 25 and 40 percent in the same span the year prior.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal breaks down to nearly $364,000 per unit.\nThe garden-style complex, previously called Solaire at Coconut Creek, was renamed Avalon Coconut Creek after the purchase.\nCompleted in 2013, Avalon Coconut Creek consists of 12 three-story apartment buildings, a club, gym and pool on a 15.2-acre site, Vizzda records show. It has one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,200 to $3,100,\nApartments.com\nshows.\nBainbridge and Rockwood\u2019s entity had paid\n$69 million\nfor the property in 2022, according to records. Bainbridge is led by Richard Schechter. Rockwood, led by managing partners David I. Becker and Tyson E. Skillings, has offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York.\nLed by Benjamin W. Schall,\nAvalonBay\nis a multifamily real estate investment trust with a portfolio of nearly 95,000 apartments across the U.S. at the end of the first quarter, its website shows. It develops, redevelops and purchases apartments.\nIt\u2019s a sporadic South Florida apartment investor and developer.\n\nIn 2021, AvalonBay paid\n$133 million\nfor the 380-unit Avalon Miramar complex 4300 Southwest 113th Terrace in Miramar.\nIn September, the firm paid\n$16.5 million\nfor a 9-acre development site in Lake Worth Beach, with plans for the\nseven-story, 279-unit\nNorthlake Promenade Apartments building. The site is adjacent to the Publix-anchored shopping plaza at 374 Northlake Boulevard.\nSouth Florida\nmultifamily investment sales\nhave experienced a slight increase in recent months. Elevated interest rates, tighter lending and slower rental demand suppressed activity in the past two years compared with the preceding bonanza. Buyers still purchasing South Florida apartment projects generally used all cash or relied on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, which usually have better terms than bank financing.\nRecords show AvalonBay did not record a mortgage for its Coconut Creek apartment complex purchase.\nLast month, Crow Holdings paid\n$97.5 million\nfor the 376-unit 33 West property at 6300 Southwest 24th Place in Davie. Crow also didn\u2019t record a mortgage.\nOthers are closing deals through stock buyouts.\nThis month, Fort Lauderdale-based Favo Capital bought the 22-story, 277-unit 1818 Park apartment tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for\n$190 million\nin an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal.\n",

The firm plans to develop a luxury apartment complex at the site, in Pico-Robertson just outside the Beverly Hills city limits.\nSelling for $13.9 million per acre, the sale marks one of the most-expensive lot sales in Los Angeles in years among deals for parcels greater than 1 acre, the outlet said. It\u2019s slightly higher than a similar sale last year where two Hollywood parking lots, previously slated for a multifamily development that stalled, sold for $13 million per acre. In June, CGI+ Real Estate Investment Strategies sold a 4.9-acre site in Torrance for $40 million, or about $8 million per acre.\nThe West Pico Boulevard site was once home to an office building and is located near retail, dining and offices in Century City and Beverly Hills.\nBW Brody Affiliated manages luxury apartments across the Los Angeles area, including the 113-unit Metro Art Sherman Oaks at 14140 Moorpark Street, and the 62-unit Metro Art Brentwood at 11771 Montana Avenue. The firm is expected to seek entitlements for multifamily.\n\nApartment\ndevelopment across the city is down 20 percent, and most projects are rising in downtown, Koreatown and east side neighborhoods, leaving the west side in the dust when it comes to construction. There are only six large apartment projects under construction in Los Angeles, according to CoStar.\nHousing construction and proposals on the Westside haven\u2019t ground to a complete halt, however. In West Los Angeles, Southern California Affordable Housing is planning to redevelop an abandoned commercial building in West Los Angeles into 279 affordable studio and one-bedroom apartments.\nApartment vacancy across Los Angeles is about 5 percent. It remains to be seen whether BW Brody Affiliated can pull off a luxury development amid high construction costs and a lengthy entitlement process that usually favors affordable housing projects.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s latest move to fund its $1.7 billion Chicago casino in River West added 1,800 investors to its real estate gamble, falling short of its $250 million stock sales target, but more offerings are on the horizon.\nThe company raised $31 million this week through a stock offering tied to its Host Community Agreement with the city, which required that 25 percent of the casino be minority-owned, according to an SEC filing. The sale brought in $5.5 million from small investors and another $25.6 million from private buyers, with shares priced between $250 and $25,000, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Bally\u2019s Chairman\nSoo Kim\ncast it as the first in a series of sales, after raising just 12.4 percent of the goal. The value of the IPO is $96.7 million, including Class A investments, private placement and Bally\u2019s funding to support individual investors, according to the filing.\nthe ownership push for redeveloping the 30-acre former Chicago Tribune printing plant site at 700 West Chicago Avenue is just one piece of a far larger financing puzzle for Bally\u2019s. The company has already locked down $940 million in debt, which is funding demolition and foundation work at the former Tribune Publishing site along the Chicago River, where the permanent casino and resort are scheduled to open in about a year. The balance of the project cost will be covered through a mix of equity sales and additional financing.\nThe offering\u2019s shortfall raises the risk of noncompliance with the Host Community Agreement, which could trigger penalties or even jeopardize the city\u2019s approval, Bally\u2019s warned. The project is secure as long as debt and construction financing continue flowing. Unlike the stock offering, the debt facility is critical to keeping the build-out on schedule.\n\nThe equity sale also highlights a broader tension in casino development: pairing community ownership promises with the realities of large-scale financing. While 1,800 small investors bought into the $250 tier, most of the heavy lifting came from big checks in the private placement. Critics said the approach risks turning a political win into a symbolic gesture, while the real estate project powering ahead will ultimately depend more on lenders than local shareholders.\nBally\u2019s Chicago refiled and expanded the IPO in April, eliminating the minority requirements in the IPO after two lawsuits from two white men\nalleging discrimination\nin the investment opportunity were settled in Chicago federal court. Loop Capital Markets, a Chicago-based placement agent, headed up the IPO offering. Bally\u2019s has operated a temporary casino at the Medinah Temple since late 2023.\nThe\nconstruction\ntimeline on the casino, which includes a 500-room hotel, 10 restaurants, 4,000 gaming positions and an exhibition space, is set for an opening date by September 2026, but recent construction delays could affect that goal.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
