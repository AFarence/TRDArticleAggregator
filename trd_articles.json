        "content": "The California-to-Texas pipeline typically involves making money in California and buying a house in Texas.\nTim Leiweke\nput his own spin on the trope: The sports-and-entertainment venue developer made his money in California and got indicted in Texas.\nThe indictment is history because Leiweke is now the latest beneficiary of President Donald Trump\u2019s clemency, adding a line to a resume that includes prior stints as CEO of Oak View Group, and a stretch serving as top executive for billionaire Philip Anschutz\u2019s AEG Worldwide.\nLeiweke is no stranger to attention \u2014 he led AEG as it gathered up ownership of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, LA Galaxy soccer franchise, a piece of the Lakers, plus the L.A. Live entertainment complex and its\nCrypto.com\narena anchor.\nHis renown turned toward notoriety in Austin, however, where earlier this year he was accused of conspiring with a competitor to rig the bidding process for the $375 million development of the Moody Center, an arena and event venue at the University of Texas at Austin, to benefit Oak View Group. Leiweke promised subcontracting work on the project to the rival company in exchange for dropping its competing bid.\nHe flagrantly flouted the cardinal rule of business in the Internet age: \u201cdon\u2019t put in an email what you wouldn\u2019t want shared on a witness stand in court.\u201d Indeed, he apparently bragged about the scheme in an email, writing, \u201cwe were very clever to put together an agreement that scared everyone else away,\u201d the New York Times\nreported\n.\nTrump\u2019s own Department of Justice charged him with violation of the Sherman Act, the 19th-century antitrust law that prohibits conspiracies to restrain trade. Leiweke was indicted by a federal grand jury in July 2025.\nThe pardon was announced the day after the firm Leiweki founded named a new CEO, Chris Granger. Leiweke stepped down from his leadership position in June. The company was fined $15 million for its involvement in the scheme. It still manages the arena at the center of the crime.\nMehrdad Moayedi defines DFW real estate swagger\nIranian-American developer and founder of Centurion American\nMehrdad Moayedi\nmoved to Fort Worth from Tehran at the age of 15. A half-century later, he\u2019s the most prolific single-family lot developer in North Texas \u2014 at the same time that Dallas-Fort Worth exploded into one of the country\u2019s top five metro regions. The uniquely Texan story of his rise and his singular impact (he developed 75,000 acres of single-family lots) have made him an archetype of the North Texas developer.\nRobert A.M. Stern\u2019s Lone Star State legacy\nRenowned architect Robert A.M. Sterns,\nwho died last month\nat the age of 86, will be primarily remembered for the condos he designed in New York City and South Florida.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Sterns Architects (RAMSA) also garnered recognition for what\u2019s shaping up to be\na genre-defining project in Texas\n. In addition to New York entries such as the Naftali Group\u2019s Bellemont and 15 Central Park West for Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, the list of notable Stern-designed projects will soon include\nHoward Hughes Holdings\u2019 Ritz-Carlton Residences in The Woodlands\n.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\nTroubled CRE debt surges in Texas\nFor months, the value of Texas CRE loans flagged for each monthly foreclosure sale has hovered around $600 million. In December,\nit shot up to more than $900 million\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nOf the $911 million in loans scheduled for auction, $659 million is tied to multifamily properties. Plus, multiple loans flagged earlier this year but were never sold appear headed back to auction block, like\nCharles Cohen\u2019s Houston design center\nat 5120 Woodway Drive, which was originally headed to auction in June and July.\nVultures circle over Jon Venetos\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was\nhit with two new lawsuits\nfrom Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, the latest in a passel of default lawsuits against the value-add multifamily investor. In the filings, Keybank not only accuses Venetos of defaulting and letting the properties fall into disrepair; it also claims Venetos transferred $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account.\n",

        "content": "Developers aren\u2019t the only answer to the urgent question of how to fast-track rebuilding after a fire, but they\u2019re one part of the solution, said\nNew Pointe Communities\nfounder and President Scot Sandstrom.\nThe San Diego-based developer would know after his firm was part of the community rebuilding following the Witch Creek fires in 2007.\n\u201cIn San Diego, from Witch Creek, there were over 300 homes [burned]. We did 47,\u201d Sandstrom told\nThe Real Deal\nas he stood outside New Pointe\u2019s nearly completed home at 3245 Arrowhead Court in fire-scarred Altadena. The four-bed, four-bath property is one of 15 single-family homes the company plans to redevelop on spec.\n\u201cThere are 4,000 homes here that need to be rebuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everybody to be a part of it, not just homeowners rebuilding [or] builders rebuilding. I think it takes everybody.\u201d\nSandstrom, company executives and agents were on hand Thursday at Arrowhead Court for a caravan to show the property.\nArrowhead Court is the first and will be completed in January. It\u2019s already listed for just under $1.9 million, or $890 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Jeff Salcido and Mark Marquez are the listing agents.\nThe listing hits close to home for Salcido, whose brother and sister-in-law were the previous homeowners. With a baby on the way, rebuilding didn\u2019t make sense and the couple made the decision to sell to New Pointe.\nPalisades hits milestone\nThe Pacific Palisades is showing its own signpost of progress.\nRick Caruso\nwas on hand Friday to help mark that milestone at\n915 Kagawa Street\n.\nThomas James Homes executives celebrated the completion of the company\u2019s first rebuild as its CEO James Mead told press he thinks the number of TJH projects in the neighborhood could balloon to 100 next year.\nMead led Caruso on a tour of the four-bed, four-and-a-half-bath showcase home, with a gaggle of reporters, photographers, executives and media handlers at their heels as they walked the 6,500-square-foot property.\nCaruso will be back in the area on Saturday when, just a few blocks away from Kagawa Street, his Palisades Village will host its Christmas tree lighting event as he noted the juxtaposition of something seemingly so normal with the surrounding burn scars.\nLori Hyland on the future\nBy Monday, Hilton &amp; Hyland is expected to be fully back up and running after making the move to 345 North Maple Drive in Beverly Hills.\nThe legacy brokerage\u2019s move comes just a few weeks after its former landlord, Standard Oil Investment Group, asked a judge to throw out its lawsuit against Hilton &amp; Hyland for unpaid rent. At the time of the May filing, the brokerage owed more than $650,000 with over $65,000 tacked on in late fees, according to court documents.\nHilton &amp; Hyland Chair\nLori Hyland waved off\nany thoughts the move was the result of a dispute with the landlord, calling their relationship \u201cgood\u201d and the new address \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with our business.\u201d\nOn that last point, market chatter had reached a fever pitch earlier this year as agents continued to leave the firm and speculation mounted that a sale was in the works.\nHyland \u2014 whose husband was the late Jeff Hyland, co-founder of Hilton &amp; Hyland with Rick Hilton \u2014 said the brokerage was never up for sale and she\u2019s not looking to strike a deal in the future either.\n\u201cYou know\u2026 we live in a very, tight community,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beverly Hills all my life. I went to grammar school here. I know it very well. Everybody has something to say and it\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\nWhat comes after reality?\nA lot, if you\u2019re Josh Flagg.\nThe Compass agent is running his family\u2019s commercial real estate business, Flagg Family Capital, which has deep roots in Los Angeles commercial real estate and history.\nFlagg seems to be all over the place simultaneously, investing in consumer businesses, such as a Pop\u2019s Bagels; co-founding real estate media firm Estate Media; and, of course, serving clients with his residential real estate business.\nIf you missed the story in\nTRD\n\u2019s December issue,\nclick here\nfor a look at Flagg beyond the small screen.\n",

        "content": "When is the passage of a historic, citywide rezoning law that creates room for more than 36,000 new homes in a single city not enough? When that city is San Francisco, cradle of the YIMBY movement, where the state has mandated the city permit more than 82,000 new homes by 2031.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 Tuesday passage of the rezoning rules was a major political victory for freshman Mayor Daniel Lurie. The so-called Family Zoning Plan, approved in a 7-4 vote, upzoned about 60% of the city, including neighborhoods that haven\u2019t added new housing in decades, such as the Richmond, Sunset and Marina districts.\nIn a recent conversation with The Real Deal, a major housing California developer characterized the plan as a \u201cfantastic long-term win,\u201d but expressed skepticism about the short-term impact on housing development. Among the challenges in the near term: Interest rates on development financing and the material and labor costs of construction as the real pain points in building housing in San Francisco. The developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, doesn\u2019t expect costs to come down but foresees interest rates falling over the next year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think much housing gets added in 2026 or 2027,\u201d the developer said, adding that \u201cthe city is doing everything it possibly can,\u201d on the legislative side to spur housing development.\nMajor pro-housing groups in the state disagree. According to a report from the San Francisco Business Times, three such organizations have threatened to sue the city for not going far enough with the Family Zoning Plan. YIMBY Law, the California Housing Defense Fund and Californians for Home Ownership, are each mulling legal action over what they see as a violation of state law.\nThe groups point to an October report by the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office, which projected that the Family Zoning Plan would only produce 15,000 new homes over the next two decades \u2014\nwell short of the plan\u2019s promised capacity\n, and a fraction of the state\u2019s mandate for the city to permit 82,000 new homes by 2031. San Francisco planning officials told the Business Times that the state had endorsed early versions of the Family Zoning Plan.\nHowever, if the groups do file a lawsuit and are successful in court, the city, without an approved zoning plan, could end up out of compliance with state housing rules. The state may then implement builder\u2019s remedy, which allows developers increased latitude to propose projects without any consideration of local zoning law, provided projects designate a minimum of 10 percent of units for affordable rates, with the requirement ranging upward on a case-by-case basis.\nThen there are some who believe the city-wide rezoning goes too far, including District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan, one of four supervisors to vote against the changes. Chan\u2019s dissent sets the stage for the kind of debates San Franciscans will hear during the 2026 campaigns for Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s congressional seat. Chan, a progressive second-term supervisor who declared for the race late last month, is likely to operate as a sort of foil to\nstate Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s pro-housing development reputation\n. Wiener has already criticized Chan as \u201cunsuccessful at getting anything done\u201d since she joined the board of supervisors in 2021.\nWhile city hall was debating land use changes to spur new housing, two high-profile projects returned to the headlines with new life.\nThe troubled residential development at 360 Fifth Street is now poised to be taller and with more units after Novato-based\nThompson Builders recently submitted new building permit\ns that would take the project from 20 to 21 stories, with an additional 14 units, bringing the total to 272. The property faced a public nuisance lawsuit last year when San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu accused the former developer, Leap Development, of abandoning the partially excavated site. Thompson Builders, who was contracted by Leap to build the project, bought the site for $1.3 million earlier this year.\nDeveloper Crescent Heights is\nreportedly restarting talks for its $1 billion, 67-story residential tower\nin downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Business Times reported that the Miami-based developer has begun early-stage talks around making the 1,000-unit project a reality. According to the Business Times, Crescent Heights aims to break ground in 2027 on what would be San Francisco\u2019s first high-rise residential tower in years.\n",

        "content": "Rising home prices aren\u2019t going anywhere in Chicago.\nThat\u2019s according to a recent forecast from Realtor.com, which predicts the market\u2019s prices will rise 4.4 percent year-over-year in 2026, about twice as much as the national average.\nThe expected increase is largely due to a lack of new inventory in the metro, said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at Depaul University.\nChicago is behind most cities\nwhen it comes to home construction, ranking near the bottom among large metros in 2024.\n\u201cOther parts of the country that have exceeded pre-pandemic inventory levels are also areas where you see more new housing and construction,\u201d Smith said. \u201cChicago and Illinois tend to lag in producing new housing.\u201d\nThe bad news for brokers, however, is that despite\nhome prices going up\n, the report predicts sales volume will decrease by 2.3 percent, reflecting the tight competition and low supply in the market.\nSmith said his institute conducted a similar study for Illinois Realtors, which projected home prices in the metro will grow by 5 percent between October 2025 and October 2026.\nThis comes as\nChicago defies\nmuch of the nation over the last year in price growth while other regions, particularly in the South and West, have seen home values tumble.\nNationally, home prices are expected to grow by 2.2% and sales volume by 1.7%, the national report said. Chicago ranked among the top third of U.S. metros for projected price growth.\nThe Realtor.com report expects mortgage rates to drop slightly to 6.3 percent, down from an average of 6.6 percent this year. Those rates will likely unlock some new inventory as people move out of homes with low-interest mortgages, Smith said, but with strained inventory, new listings could see bidding wars and even higher prices.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a great short-term fix, other than just steadily reducing interest rates to unlock that inventory while also increasing demand,\u201d he said.\nEven if interest rates don\u2019t fall considerably next year, buyers have largely gotten used to the reality that rates above 6 percent are business as usual. Grigory Pekarsky, managing broker at Vesta Preferred Realty, said he hasn\u2019t worked with buyers who have expressed concern about mortgage rates in the last six months.\n\u201cThat just means a complete consumer absorption of normalization of these rates,\u201d Pekarsky said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not even a calculation in my opinion anymore.\u201d\nAs home prices are likely to rise across the metro, downtown Chicago may see a turnaround after years of falling prices and low demand, Pekarsky said. Pekarsky expects downtown prices to be buoyed in 2026 as buyers, especially first-timers, see it as an affordable and attractive option.\n\u201cI feel like next year the Gold Coast, River North, Loop market, is going to finally have its day,\u201d he said. \u201cThese areas are the last ones that just haven\u2019t recovered properly since COVID depression in pricing.\u201d\nMeanwhile, prices aren\u2019t likely to slow down in the hottest neighborhoods and suburbs that have seen major price growth in recent years. Jena Radnay, an @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent who has brokered many of the most expensive deals this year\nalong Winnetka\u2019s shoreline\n, said the North Shore suburbs are set for more growth in 2026.\nShe noted that the Mediterranean restaurant Avec is opening a location in Highwood. The introduction of the high end restaurant to the North Shore is a good sign for the continued rise of the area, Radnay said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be seeing a much more hip, savvy North Shore than we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think things are going to start growing up here.\u201d\nWhile the high-end areas will see growth, Smith said the same is true over the past few years in Chicago\u2019s lower cost neighborhoods, as buyers seek affordability in an increasingly competitive market.\n\u201cPrice growth is strongest in a lot of lower cost or more affordable places,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to disentangle who\u2019s buying it. Is it investors who are seeking relatively low value, or is it owner-occupants that are really looking for more affordable homebuying options, or is it a bit of both?\u201d",

        "content": "Brad Zackson\u2019s firm filed an eleventh-hour bankruptcy to halt a foreclosure on a highly ambitious Bronx megaproject.\nZackson put his company, Dynamic Star, and three affiliates\u2019 controlling equity stakes in Fordham Landing into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in White Plains on December 1. The move stopped a foreclosure auction scheduled for December 2.\nThe bankruptcies add to the intrigue of Fordham Landing, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use project along the Harlem River. The ground-up development had an odd cast of partners and was spearheaded by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, a protege of Fred Trump and a past business associate of Paul Manafort.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported on Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nIn recent months, Dynamic Star\u2019s lender initiated\nforeclosures\non the two parts of Fordham Landing. A mysterious lender with ties to Brooklyn-based CREMAC Asset Management alleged Dynamic Star had fallen behind on a $55 million loan and a $18.9 million loan, according to a notice for the foreclosure auction.\nDynamic Star could lose equity interests in both phases of the development if the foreclosure goes through.\nIn Fordham Landing\u2019s north phase of the project, the developers planned to build 2.7 million square feet of new development with 1.8 million market and affordable housing, 744,000 square feet of office, and 143,000 square feet of retail. In the south phase, they planned to build over 900 units of affordable housing.\nDynamic Star\u2019s larger north phase has a longer-term projection and Zackson said the development team has spent the past few years obtaining zoning approvals. In a bankruptcy filing, Zackson said once the zoning is approved, the developers are confident they will be able to bring in a new investor group to complete the project.\nMeanwhile, the 900 units of affordable housing in the south phase were expected to be delivered by next year, according to Zackson. The developers had recently secured over $55 million from the state to assist with site infrastructure.\nZackson said in a bankruptcy filing that the changes and modifications in the project limited the debtor\u2019s financing options.\nBut in another lawsuit, Dynamic Star\u2019s co-founder Segal blamed one of Fordham Landing\u2019s partners for some of its issues. Segal alleges Great Neck-based developer Igal Namdar was the actual buyer of its loans and attempted to foreclose to take control of the project.\nIn the bankruptcy filing, Zackson alleges Namdar may be the owner of the mezzanine loans. He further alleged Namdar failed to show up for an emergency meeting to discuss the bankruptcy.\nNamdar did not return a request to comment. Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy attorney, Kevin Nash, also did not return a request to comment.\n",

        "content": "Waste is a terrible thing to mind. Just ask Dominick Romeo.\nOther than a few building superintendents and extremely close followers of city politics, nobody noticed that the West 18th street resident ran against City Council member Erik Bottcher this fall. Romeo was crushed.\nThe superintendent is best known for organizing opposition to the Adams administration\u2019s trash pickup rules, which he said were taking him and fellow supers away from their families in the evening.\nThis platform proved woefully insufficient for Romeo to win on the \u201c\nBlue Collar/Fight and Deliver\n\u201d ballot line in a heavily Democratic Manhattan district. He got a mere\n9 percent\nof the vote.\nBut we\u2019re going to highlight Romeo\u2019s main issue anyway because it matters to thousands of property managers \u2014 and costs some of them money.\nTo reduce rats\u2019 opportunity to feed, the Adams administration required that garbage be set out at 6 p.m. (if in bins) or 8 p.m. (if in bags) instead of 4 p.m. As a result, some buildings \u2014 even affordable housing developments struggling financially because of\nfalling rents\nand\nnonpaying tenants\n\u2014 are\npaying overtime\nto staffers who take out the trash.\nThe Department of Sanitation says paying overtime because of the\nnew rule\nis a choice, not an obligation.\n\u201cEven if a building chooses to set out [trash] after 8 p.m., it is a logical fallacy to say that \u2018forces\u2019 overtime,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA building can simply set any work schedule that may fit its needs.\u201d\nThe agency offered a 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. set-out time for superintendents who work earlier shifts and designed routes to quickly collect the trash from the 2,500 buildings that opted in.\n\u201cWe have been extremely flexible to make this work for property owners and managers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nMayor Eric Adams deserves credit for going after rats, and it makes sense to require rat-resistant bins for garbage, even though\nfood waste\nis supposed to go into thicker brown bins.\nBut if bins are mandatory, why also require later set-out times? How many rats are going to venture out from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. to gnaw through hard plastic bins?\nDSNY\u2019s response was that this is not just about rats. New Yorkers, according to the agency, shouldn\u2019t have to share the sidewalk with trash during the afternoon rush.\nAt this point, I am obligated to point out that Sanitation is not obliged to promptly collect the trash. If you call 311 on collection day to report that your garbage was not picked up, the agent will not take your complaint. Instead, you will be told to call back the next day if the trash is still there.\nThis is because DSNY is not officially late until 24 hours have passed. Enterprising rodents still have a chance. Dominick Romeo, not so much.\n",

Total projected sellout of the top 10 also declined 34 percent year over year, from $1.4 billion to $918 million.\nIn Brooklyn, the listing inventory for new development condos in the third quarter declined year over year by nearly 25 percent, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\nIn Queens, the number of closed sales on new development condos declined by 55 percent in the same period.\nNew Empire Corp\u2019s 757 Flatbush Avenue took home the top spot on this year\u2019s list. The finish was a sign of the times: the project\u2019s $136 million projected sellout would have come in fifth in 2024.\nThe neighborhoods home to the biggest condo filings also shifted. Last year\u2019s list was dominated by the trendy neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Boerum Hill and Long Island City, while the biggest developments in 2025 were situated further away from Manhattan, including projects in Flatbush, Arverne, and Windsor Terrace.\n757 Flatbush Avenue, Flatbush | New Empire Corp. | $136 million\nNew Empire nabbed the most valuable filing in the two boroughs with its 757 Flatbush project. At 132 units, the developer expects the eight-story project to pull in $136.4 million at final sellout. The project will be anchored by a retail and commercial space.\nThe project broke ground this summer and nabbed a $9.2 million refinancing from Pacific National Financing this fall.\n127 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg | Joyland Group and Prospect Developers II | $144 million\nJoyland Group and Prospect Developers took the No. 2 spot with \u201cThe Sixth,\u201d their 43-unit development in Williamsburg near the waterfront.\u00a0 The six-floor project features two penthouse floors.\nUnits have not been listed but Corcoran is advertising the project. Joyland paid $43.3 million for the development site at the end of 2024, PincusCo reported.\n141 Beach 67th Street, Arverne | Beechwood Homes | $110 million\nThe waterfront development at 141 Beach 67th Street is expected to yield $110 million. The project, called Lighthouse, is one block from the ocean, on the Rockaways peninsula. The units start in the mid-$500,000s, according to the project website.\n23 Ocean Parkway, Windsor Terrace | Aview Equities | $109 million\nAview Equities is planning a 99-unit development where Windsor Terrace meets Kensington, at Prospect Park\u2019s southern edge. The project expects to sell out at $109 million.\nThe development, which has an alternate address of 57 Caton Place, made headlines this summer for allegedly\ndisturbing horses\nat the Prospect Park stables. In 2023, Parkview Financial filed a\npre-foreclosure suit\nrelated to a $66 million construction loan it originated for the project. The suit was discontinued last year.\n110 Boerum Place, Cobble Hill | Avdoo Partners | $100 million\nAvdoo Partners expects $100 million from its development on Boerum Place, which will deliver 21 residential units. Valley National Bank provided a $47 million construction loan this summer. Initial prices will start at about $3 million for a two-bedroom, according to City Realty.\n600 &amp; 610 DeKalb Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant | Allure Group, Joel Landau | $99 million\nThe development at 600 DeKalb Avenue will deliver 70 condos alongside 320 rental units, according to New York YIMBY. Allure Group secured $155 million in construction financing for the project, on the western side of Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is expected to bring in $99 million in sales.\n2102 East 1st Street, Gravesend | Redhoek + Partners | $76 million\nThis Gravesend project from Redhoek + Partners is slated for just 12 units, but a $76 million sellout. Eight of the units in the ground-up development, called the Onyx Residences, will be duplexes with double-height spaces, according to the project website.\n70-40 45th Avenue, Elmhurst | Ching Lam and Jia Xin Chen | $63 million\nThe condo building at 70-40 45th Avenue is expected to deliver 93 residential units, for a total sellout of $63 million. Sany Realty Group is listing the sponsor units, according to StreetEasy. Sponsor units on the site start at $558,000.\n35-30 146th Street, Flushing | Cun Chen, Ming Chen | $57 million\nWith a projected sellout of $57 million, the development at 35-30 146th Street is planning to deliver 44 one and two-bedroom residential units. PRO Links Realty has taken over marketing and sales for the project, called 146 Northern. Prices start at $528,000 for a one-bedroom, according to the project site. The building also contains four retail stores.\n630 Grand Avenue, Crown Heights | The Loketch Group | $53 million\nThe Loketch Group has constructed a 32-unit condo building on Grand Avenue, where Crown Heights and Prospect Heights meet. Sponsor units start at $789,000, with Corcoran responsible for the listings. The top penthouse is asking $2.8 million.

The next day, prominent entertainment agent Gary Osier sold his Old Preston Hollow home to Jeffrey and Lori Runnfeldt, an investor and boutique proprietor, respectively.\nBoth homes listed in the spring and landed on the Houston Association of Realtors\u2019 ranking of the ten\nmost expensive residential listings in the state\nin\nMay\n.\nThe Kidd property in Highland Park,\u00a0 a 1936 six-bedroom, six-bathroom home on Glenwood Avenue, was asking $11.5 million when it sold \u2014 almost $2,000 per square foot for the 6,000-square-foot property. Located in a conservation district and platted as its own subdivision for the seller in 1997, the verdant lot includes a putting area, a greenhouse and a stream fed by Turtle Creek.

The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, 10,300-square-foot home is on a 1.1-acre lot on Park Lane. Osier, whose clients include Foreigner, Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler and the Beach Boys, was asking $11.7 million for the home when it sold, or about $1,000 per square foot. The property includes a guest casita and a pool. Allie Beth Allman and Associates agent Alex Perry had the listing.\nFinal sale prices are unavailable.\nThe two are the first to sell among ultra-luxury homes that listed statewide in late April and May.

        "content": "Entry-level homeowners in Sugar Land, a suburb in America\u2019s amplest housing market, will be able to cover more renovation costs with city funding in 2026.\nSugar Land, a city about 19 miles southwest of Houston, announced Wednesday that it will expand its Great Homes Update Program, which reimburses homeowners for certain property enhancements. Since 2023, the program has covered 10 to 25 percent of project costs with a maximum payment of $10,000. Starting January, reimbursements of 50 percent will be available to homeowners whose properties are in the bottom 3 percent of single-family home values, amounting to about a thousand homes in Sugar Land, according to Ana Rodriguez, Sugar Land community development coordinator.\nThe city is also expanding eligibility to include heir owners. The Great Homes Program formerly required traditional proof of ownership, such as a recorded deed, but many heir-occupied homes have not gone through a formal title process.\nOnly eight homes in this category have used the program over the last three years. The city hopes the expansion will bring in 25 additional participants in 2026.\n\u201cMany of the households in the bottom 3 percent faced barriers that made it difficult to meet the program\u2019s original requirements. Some did not carry homeowner\u2019s insurance, or had fully paid-off homes, which meant they lacked the documentation required to qualify,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cOthers could not meet the $4,000 minimum project cost, making the program financially out of reach.\u201d\nThe program is available to landlords as well as owners who occupy their properties, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cThere are quite a few neighborhoods that we saw fall into this 3 percent bracket: Mayfield Park, Covington Woods, Farrington Place, Chimneystone and Ragus Lake,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nSo far, Sugar Land has reimbursed $791,000 for projects totaling $5.3 million in costs through the program. The city has budgeted $200,000 for the program for fiscal year 2026.\nThe Houston metro area has\nmore homes for sale than any other metro in the country\n. It\u2019s also the only metro in the Texas Triangle where inventory has grown apace in the past few months; sellers have been\nleaving the market\nin Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. The distinction is probably due to a swift pipeline of\nmaster-planned communities\nin the Houston area, where over 20 percent of all master-planned community sales in the country take place.\nNearby master-planned community projects include a\n7,000-home development east of Fulshear\n. Hines received $129.2 million in Texas Infrastructure Program bonds for the project, secured by Fort Bend County MUD reimbursements.\n",

Kennedy, James Nelson, Erik Edeen and Sullivan Johnston are leading the effort.\nThe property was built in 1958 and renovated in 2014. Its zoning would allow for redevelopment as multifamily, hospitality and office.

It was previously owned by\ntroubled syndicator Kenny Wolfe\n, who founded Dallas-based Wolfe Investments.\nWolfe announced his purchase of the tower, whose capital stack included the $13 million loan from Thistle Creek and $9 million in equity, less than a year earlier. He had planned to convert it from offices to 238 apartment units. Around the same time, he partnered with Dallas-based developer Bluelofts and purchased the historic Oil &amp; Gas Building in downtown Fort Worth with similar conversion plans. He lost that building to foreclosure, too.\nWolfe\u2019s downfall was defined by his attempt to stick the landing on an ambitious pivot from collecting a portfolio of dollar stores and older apartment complexes to executing the notoriously challenging office-to-resi conversion in downtown Dallas, Fort Worth and Cleveland.\nDespite the building\u2019s complicated recent past, conversion experts agree it has potential.\nA 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in coordination with New York University and Columbia University identified the midcentury-modern tower as one of 50 North Texas buildings structurally ripe for conversion.\nNew York University professor and report author Arpit Gupta said 211 North Ervay \u201cmet all the criteria\u201d for a conversion candidate, including location, age and the distance between the building\u2019s core and its windows.",

        "content": "The owners of Goat Hospitality Group secured a buyer during\nMiami Art Week\nfor their Pinecrest estate, which is on the market for $18 million.\nThe pending deal marks the most expensive of 14 contracts signed in Miami-Dade County between Dec. 1 and Dec. 7, according to the latest Eklund-Gomes report. It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 173 days on the market, on average.\nSixty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,323 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed 11 contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $86.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 11 single-family homes and three condos under contract last week totals $100.6 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $7.4 million and spent an average of 169 days on the market. They total $81.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nEklund and Elliman\u2019s Jennifer Goldstein have the listing for the top contract, the pending sale of the 12,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom and nine-and-a-half-bathroom mansion at 10061 Southwest 60th Court. Records show Derek and Lisa Gonzalez of\nGoat Hospitality\npaid $5.7 million\nfor the 0.9-acre property in 2022. They had a new home built on the property with a Balinese-style pool, outdoor shower, sauna and a primary suite, according to the listing.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6.3 million and spent 183 days on the market, on average. They total $19 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,154 per square foot.\nA unit at the\nEstates at Acqualina\nin Sunny Isles Beach marked the priciest condo to enter into contract last week. Unit 1903 at 17901 Collins Avenue, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, is on the market with Ryan Mendell of Maxwell E Realty Inc.

        "content": "Mountain View is now the priciest city in Silicon Valley for renters.\nRents in the Peninsula city have climbed past pre-pandemic highs, with some new luxury one-bedrooms fetching approximately $5.75 per square foot, up from a previous peak of $5.50 per square foot, per CBRE data\ncited\nby the San Francisco Business Times. At that amount, the typical new one-bedrooms at the national average of about 735 square feet would lease for approximately $4,200 per month.\nThe new high for Mountain View comes as artificial intelligence companies flock to the Bay Area in droves, attracting thousands of workers and executives in need of housing. AI giant OpenAI is\nreportedly on the market\nfor up to 500,000 square feet of offices in Silicon Valley, with Mountain View emerging as a top choice, according to real estate sources\ncited\nby the Business Times. As AI hiring picks up, so too does housing demand; AI job postings in Santa Clara County, for example, have jumped to 8 percent from 3 percent over the past three years.\nIn San Francisco,\napartment rents have increased\nan average of 6 percent over the past year \u2014 more than double the 2.5 percent jump in New York City, per CoStar data\ncited\nby the New York Times. By contrast,\nrent growth nationwide\nhas fallen to 0.5 percent year-over-year, while vacancy has increased to 4.4 percent and net absorption dropped to its lowest third-quarter levels since 2022, per CBRE data.\nLast month, the Mountain View City Council rejected a\nproposal from Greystar Real Estate Partners\nthat would increase housing supply in the city. The South Carolina-based firm has long planned to turn a J.P. Morgan Chase branch at 749 West El Camino Real into a 299-unit mixed-use development. Greystar requested to increase its construction timeline from two years to eight, but the city denied that request.\nUnder its state-mandated housing goals, the City of Mountain View must plan for 11,135 new housing units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "In March, the city\nput out the request\nfor a developer to take on a conversion at 100 Gold Street. GFP Real Estate answered the call.\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation selected GFP to redevelop the 10-story office building in the Financial District, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. GFP will revamp the 1960s-built government building with a mixed-income residential building with thousands of units.\nSpecifically, there are 3,700 units planned for the site, a drastic increase from the 2,000 units Mayor Eric Adams sought when revealing plans for the property back in January; Adams\nannounced plans\nfor the property in his State of the City address as part of a broader \u201cManhattan Plan,\u201d an initiative he said would bring 100,000 new homes to the borough over the next decade.\nAt least 25 percent of the units will need to be designated affordable. Other aspects of the redevelopment include 40,000 square feet of open space for the public and a fitness center.\nDetails of the acquisition costs for GFP were not disclosed, but funds from purchasing the city-owned site will go towards finding office space for relocating city tenants, including the New York City Department of Housing Preservation &amp; Development, the Housing Choice Voucher program and GrowNYC.\nThe Hamilton-Madison House, a social services nonprofit provider, will receive a purpose-built facility on the site and relocate nearby during the construction period.\nIn a statement, GFP co-chief executive officer Brian Steinwurtzel said the firm was \u201chonored to have been selected\u201d for the project. He also talked about a \u201ccollaborative process with the community,\u201d which will be put to the test with land use reviews in 2027.\nThe project builds on Adams\u2019 executive order calling on city agencies to identify city-owned or controlled property suitable for housing development.\nGFP is fresh off another FiDi conversion, turning a former 1.1-million-square-foot office property at 25 Water Street into one of the largest office-to-resi conversions in U.S. history. GFP, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital recently secured\nan $835 million refinancing package\nfrom Apollo and GIC for the 1,320-unit project, which began leasing in late January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Nick Kokonas, co-owner of Chicago\u2019s Alinea restaurant and founder of the Tock reservation platform, sold his distinctive Old Town property at a significantly discounted price of $4.65 million.\nThe restaurateur and his wife, Dagmara Kokonas, closed the deal for their home at 223 West Eugenie Street at nearly $2 million below the original asking price of $6.84 million set in October 2023, according to\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\n. The property consists of two 19th-century houses joined by a modern glass bridge, along with two rear buildings, one dating back to the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\nInitially, Kokonas attempted to\nsell the home\nusing his self-devised \u201cinverted commission\u201d model, which ties the buyer\u2019s agent commission to the accepted offer price, with a higher percentage commission tied to a higher sale price. The property sat on the market for months with no asking price and no listing agent. He had successfully used this method in previous sales in Winnetka, Kenilworth and Northbrook.\nHowever, after five months without a sale, Kokonas turned to\nCompass\nagent Jeff Lowe, who eventually reduced the listing price twice, bringing it down to just under $5.9 million by September 2024.\nThe final sale represents a roughly 32 percent discount from the original asking price.\nWhether the Kokonases profited on the property is uncertain. They purchased it for $3.66 million in 2009 and invested heavily in renovations, including a restaurant-style kitchen and updates to the historic outbuildings. If renovation costs exceeded $1 million, the couple may have taken a loss.\nNeither Kokonas nor Lowe commented on the sale, and the buyer remains unidentified in public records. From the street, the property appears as two modest wood frame houses typical of Old Town, but inside it blends historic architecture with modern design, including interiors inspired by Edgar Miller\u2019s neighborhood work in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe sale comes during Kokonas\u2019 broader career transition. In September 2024, he sold his ownership stake in the Alinea Group, retaining only a passive minority interest in Alinea itself. His partnership with chef Grant Achatz had spanned 19 years, during which Alinea became Chicago\u2019s sole three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Recently, Michelin downgraded Alinea to two stars.\nThe Alinea Group continues to operate seven other venues, including Next and the Aviary.\nBeyond restaurants, Kokonas co-founded Tock in 2014 with Google engineer Brian Fitzpatrick. Initially focused on restaurant reservations, the platform expanded to wineries and hospitality bookings. Squarespace acquired Tock for $400 million in 2021, and Kokonas remained with the company until early 2023.\nThe Eugenie Street sale marks the 147th\nChicago home sale\nabove $4 million in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 136 set in 2022. The surge highlights the strength of the city\u2019s\nluxury housing market\n, even as the broader market remains relatively flat.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Sharon Baum, a veteran Manhattan luxury broker, has died at the age of 85.\nThe powerhouse broker spent more than 30 years as one of the most successful agents in New York City, building on nearly two decades as a female trailblazer in corporate leadership before moving into brokering luxury deals.\nCorcoran CEO Pam Liebman announced Baum\u2019s death in an internal memo to the brokerage where\nBaum began her career in 1991\n, lauding her as a character of style and substance. Baum was with the firm for more than three decades before joining Douglas Elliman last year.\n\u201cSharon was a pioneer in every sense of the word: sharp, stylish and always several steps ahead,\u201d wrote Liebman.\nTo accompany her deals for premier properties, she sported a diamond pin on her lapel and a forest green Rolls-Royce bearing the license plate, \u201cSOLD 1,\u201d that she temporarily retired following the Great Financial Crisis for something more understated.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so focused on knowledge and intelligence rather than pizzazz,\u201d Leonard Steinberg told\nthe Daily News in 2015\n. \u201cShe has substance.\u201d\nJonathan Conlon, Baum\u2019s longtime associate at Corcoran with whom, along with John Gasdaska, she decamped for Douglas Elliman last year, said part of Baum\u2019s legacy is reinventing the profession that had long been treated as a pastime.\n\u201cShe was one of the first true professionals who moved into the world of New York City real estate and formalized it and treated it like a business,\u201d he said. \u201cShe really helped get the New York City real estate market and business to start seeing itself that way and not as this sort of social pastime.\u201d\nBorn in 1940 in Jefferson City, Missouri, Baum attended Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College and was\none of eight women in the first co-ed graduating class\nof Harvard Business School in 1965.\nShe later joined Chemical Bank, where she spent 17 years and became the company\u2019s first female vice president. She was the subject of a 1975 Wall Street Journal article\non the rise of \u201cdual-career couples,\u201d\nas she and her husband Stephen worked full-time jobs. \u201cEvery single minute is taken up,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal in 1975. \u201cI never have time to watch TV or read a book.\u201d\nBaum made the jump to real estate in 1991, when she joined Corcoran. She quickly rose as the firm\u2019s top-selling agent, which she credited to the vast network she had built working in business for nearly two decades.\n\u201cWhat I did was a big mailing with very nice engraved cards that I sent to my master list, saying I was no longer at Chemical Bank, and I am going into a whole new field \u2014 and word got around,\u201d Baum previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cShe single-handedly walked the high-end market into my business,\u201d Corcoran co-founder Barbara Corcoran, who recruited Baum to her firm before selling it in 2001, told the Daily News. \u201cShe was that powerful. She\u2019s one of the most well-connected, well-wired brokers in Manhattan. I adore her.\u201d\nIn 1996, she was already doing over $50 million a year in sales, focusing on pre-war co-ops and townhouses. She scored one of her biggest deals in 2006, when she sold the $40 million Duke-Semans mansion on Fifth Avenue. The only agent to receive the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s Deal of the Year award twice, Baum was also awarded REBNY\u2019s Henry Forster award for lifetime achievement in 2011. As of 2024, she claimed over $2 billion in sales over the course of her career.\nKnown as the Queen of Park and Fifth avenues, Baum evolved her business with the times as money started flowing downtown, turning her relationship with Gasdaska and Conlon into a strategic partnership in 2016.\nGasdaska recalled driving through the West Village with Baum for a pitch when she asked, \u201cIs this Tribeca?\u201d\n\u201cI was like, \u2018You don\u2019t come down here very often,\u2019\u201d Gasdaska. \u201cShe started to laugh and said, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go below 59th Street.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut she knew what she knew, and she knew what she didn\u2019t,\u201d he added.\nThat didn\u2019t stop Baum from finding downtown apartments for Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence, helping the former secure a $20 million penthouse in Tribeca that was once owned by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson.\nWhen Conlon and Gasdaska decamped for Elliman in 2024, Baum joined, as the pair had started helping manage her book of business in her later years.\n\u201cHaving her be a business partner over the past nine years has been a true honor in our career,\u201d Gasdaska said.\nElliman in an internal memo said despite Baum\u2019s short time at the firm, \u201cmany of us are blessed to have known and worked with her over the course of her long, trailblazing career.\u201d\n\u201cTo call Sharon a legend would be an understatement,\u201d said Elliman CEO of Brokerage for New York Richard Ferrari.\nBaum is survived by her husband, Stephen, their two sons, Ben and Sam, and her brother, David, and his husband, Ronald, according to Elliman.",

        "content": "Eyal Ofer\u2019s $30 million repositioning of\n99 Park Avenue\nhas yielded another big lease.\nOfer\u2019s Global Holdings signed the wealth management firm Cerity Partners to just shy of 49,000 square feet at the 26-story Midtown office tower.\nCerity, which has more than $130 billion of assets under management, had been a subtenant on the 16th floor and expanded via a direct deal with the landlord.\nGlobal Holdings said it has signed more than 300,000 square feet worth of deals at 99 Park since announcing a $30 million repositioning earlier this year. It is currently 98 percent occupied.\n\u201cOur investment in a transformative renovation has positioned 99 Park as one of the most sought-after addresses near Grand Central Station, and the building\u2019s strong leasing activity this year reflects that success,\u201d said leasing director Craig Panzirer.\nGlobal Holdings has been significantly upgrading the 1950s-era, 600,000-square-foot office building just south of Grand Central between East 39th and 40th streets. This included a redesigned facade, and amenities such as a speakeasy, golf simulator and conference center. The renovation is expected to be completed next year.\nEarlier this year, the landlord signed Amalgamated Bank to a 15-year lease in a relocation from its longtime headquarters at 275 Seventh Avenue. The 94,000-square-foot deal included space on the ground floor for a private entrance lobby.\nOther recent deals at 99 Park include the strategic advisory firm Geller &amp; Company, international children\u2019s apparel company Garan, wealth-management firm Steward Partners and Metropolitan Bank.\nGeller signed its lease\nfor 45,000 square feet\nin March, relocating from 909 Third Avenue. That same month, Garan doubled its space at the building.\nThe area around Grand Central has been one of the tightest office submarkets in the city in recent years. The availability rate was 13.6 percent in the third quarter, according to Savills.\n",

The University of Chicago owns the land and issued a 65-year ground lease to the Vue53 development team when the project began.\nVista and Boston-based Bain later refinanced that debt with a $45 million loan from Argentic in 2023, according to records. It\u2019s unclear what the total development costs were or when Bain joined the ownership group.\nRepresentatives of Blue Vista, Bain Capital and Antheus Capital did not return requests for comment.\n\u201cWe have conviction in the University of Chicago student housing market and, as the newest purpose built student housing asset in the submarket, we believe the asset is well positioned,\u201d a Bain spokesperson told\nThe Real Deal\nwhen the property was last refinanced.\nThe property likely benefited from the overall strength of student housing on a national level, as well as some nuances in the local market. Hyde Park has seen growing interest among investors, and Chicago\u2019s multifamily market has thrived across the city and the suburbs.\nIn the third quarter of the year, multifamily vacancy in Chicago landed at 4.7 percent, well below the U.S. average of 8.4 percent, according to Matthews Real Estate Services.\nIn October, prolific local investor Stuart Handler sold a longtime portfolio of Hyde Park\napartments for $23 million\n.\nAnd last spring, Handler\u2019s firm, TLC Management, sold a 136-unit apartment building at 4817 South Drexel Boulevard in Hyde Park.

        "content": "Outer borough offices didn\u2019t have the Manhattan magic.\nBrooklyn and Queens office landlords spent much of 2025 courting the same tenants that kept the outer boroughs afloat since the pandemic: government agencies, schools and mission-driven groups. Private-sector users remained scarce, and the boroughs again lagged Manhattan\u2019s healthier leasing market.\nLong Island City and parts of Brooklyn continued to draw big-footprint tenants, but the surge of Midtown leasing still hasn\u2019t translated across the river. Brokers say outer borough availability remains high and deal flow uneven, even as education and public-service users quietly make up a growing slice of new leases.\nHere are the largest office deals of the year in Queens and Brooklyn, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nNYC Department of Transportation | 47-25 34th Street | 212,094 square feet\nThe city\u2019s DOT brought the year\u2019s biggest outer borough deal,\nsigning on\nfor more than 212,000 square feet at 47-25 34th Street in Long Island City. The agency took the space from Metropolitan Realty Associates and Nuveen and plans to use it for both industrial and office uses. Newmark and SL Green represented the landlord side and a CBRE team represented the tenant.\nSpectrum | 59 Paidge Avenue | 200,000 square feet\nThe cable provider\nrenewed\nits 200,000-square-foot lease at 59 Paidge Avenue in Greenpoint, opting for another 10 years at the Steel Equities-owned site. Spectrum has occupied the low-slung complex since 2011 and locked in one of Brooklyn\u2019s largest commitments of 2025.\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School | 181 Livingston Street | 147,944 square feet\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School continued the trend of education tenants backfilling slow office corridors, taking nearly 148,000 square feet at Tishman Speyer\u2019s 181 Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn in the spring. At the time, it was Brooklyn\u2019s\nlargest lease\nsince the third quarter of 2023.\nU.S. General Services Administration | 159-30 Rockaway Boulevard | 139,377 square feet\nThe GSA signed a major lease in Jamaica at an Edward J. Minskoff building,\nTRD\nreported\nat the start of the year, to be used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Queens. CBRE represented the federal tenant, while JLL handled the landlord side.\nAdministration for Children\u2019s Services | 1000 Dean Street | 105,000 square feet\nACS inked a full-building lease at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights, taking 105,000 square feet, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The move was a consolidation of spaces in Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York.\nBeacon Mobility | 2647 Stillwell Avenue | 83,000 square feet\nTransportation firm Beacon Mobility signed\nan 83,000-square-foot lease\nat Turnbridge Equities\u2019 Gravesend property. Turnbridge Equities acquired the Gravesend site two years ago for $13 million. Cushman &amp; Wakefield repped both sides of the deal.\nPlaza College | 118-35 Queens Boulevard | 80,000 square feet\nPlaza College renewed its Forest Hills presence,\ntaking 80,000 square feet\nat Muss Development\u2019s tower. CBRE\u2019s Roy Chipkin represented the tenant.\nNYC School Construction Authority | 30-30 47th Avenue | 75,000 square feet\nThe SCA extended its lease for 15 years at Atlas Capital Group\u2019s Long Island City building, at an asking rent of $45 per square foot. Unfortunately for ownership, the $300 million loan tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot office property was\nsent to special servicing\nin September for \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d according to Morningstar Credit.\n",

The buyer borrowed a $67.9 million loan from FS Credit Originator, in the care of Rialto Capital Management.\nCompleted in 1988, Ryder Colonnade spans 205,400 square feet, according to its website. It\u2019s attached to the Hotel Colonnade Coral Gables, which wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nThe price amounts to $331 per square foot.\nThe tower was recently rechristened to include the \u201cRyder\u201d name after\nRyder System\n, a Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant, moved its headquarters there. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and it moved to a smaller office, citing the remote work shift.\nIn 2013, an entity tied to Boston-based TA Associates Realty paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building, property records show. In 2015, AEW Capital, also based in Boston, took over the entity, suggesting it purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, according to state corporate records.\nCrescent, led by Chairman John Goff and CEO Conrad Suszynski, is a real estate investor, manager and developer with $4.4 billion of assets under management as of February, according to its website. (The firm is different from Miami-based Crescent Heights.)\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, insurance and other costs such as materials.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023. This has made refinancing harder and also squeezed landlords with floating-rate debt, increasing their loan obligations.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office market prospered from an influx of out-of-state companies over the past five years, increasing rents to new records. Still, some landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher rates and remote work, prompting them to sell their office buildings.\nIn other discounted deals, Orlando-based Foundry Commercial sold the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center building at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\nin January, nearly $21 million less than its price seven years ago.\nIn May, Boston-based Rockpoint, Miami-based Tricera, Palm Beach-based NDT Development and Boston-based New England Development sold the 18-story One Clearlake tower at 250 South Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n. It marked a nearly 26 percent discount from its price four years ago.\n",

        "content": "Affluent buyers looking for second homes are returning to downtown Chicago\u2019s condominiums, judging from recent sales activity at Cirrus, a 47\u2011story luxury tower in\nLakeshore East\n.\nAccording to Brad Brondyke of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who leads sales for developers Lendlease and Magellan, about 30 of the 50 condos put under contract in 2025 have gone to second home buyers,\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business reported\n.\nFor several years, affluent buyers have largely avoided purchasing downtown condos, citing concerns about safety, urban vitality and long\u2011term value. The reversal of that trend at Cirrus is notable because second home buyers historically fueled much of Chicago\u2019s luxury condo market.\nBrondyke described the uptick as \u201cgreat news for the city,\u201d signaling that lingering fears about downtown living may be diminishing.\nCirrus, at 211 North Harbor Drive with views of Du Sable Lake Shore Drive, offers high\u2011end finishes, lakefront vistas and proximity to cultural attractions. These features aim to appeal to buyers seeking a pied\u2011\u00e0\u2011terre or weekend retreat. Of the 50 contracts signed this year, three are not yet closed but are expected to finalize by year-end.\nChicago\u2019s downtown condo market has faced challenges since the pandemic, with sluggish sales and price stagnation compared to suburban and single\u2011family homes. Safety concerns and perceptions of urban decline further dampened demand. The recent momentum at Cirrus suggests a turning point, particularly among affluent buyers who can afford discretionary purchases.\nWhile the number of contracts is modest compared to the overall market, the proportion of second home buyers \u2014 roughly 60 percent of Cirrus\u2019s 2025 sales\n\u2014 is significant. It highlights renewed confidence in downtown Chicago as a desirable destination, even for part-time luxury living.\nThis trend also aligns with broader patterns in Chicagoland\u2019s luxury\nhousing market\n, where multimillion\u2011dollar sales in both suburban and urban areas have surged in 2025.\nThe most recent second-home purchase at Cirrus was last week at $4.05 million for a unit on the 47th floor, Brondyke said. That represents a nearly 19 percent discount from the developers\u2019 original asking price of $4.98 million in October 2022.\nThe unit has about 3,650 square feet with a terrace facing Lake Michigan and is the third\ncondo at Cirrus\nto trade at\n$4 million or more\n, Brondyke added. The average sale price for a Cirrus unit runs about $1.3 million.\n\u2014- Joel Russell",

        "content": "Sheraton Arlington Hotel will close to make way for the construction of a $410 new hospitality property from Loews Hotels &amp; Co.\nThe Sheraton will be demolished after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with completion of the new Loews hotel expected by 2028, according to\nthe Dallas Business Journal\n. The project, supported by incentives from the city of Arlington and the Arlington Economic Development Corporation, will transform 14 acres at 1500 Convention Center Drive.\nThe Sheraton\n, an aging 311\u2011room property built in 1984, sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 existing 888\u2011room Arlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center and Live! by Loews in the city\u2019s\nEntertainment District\n.\nThe new Loews property will feature 513 rooms, 25,000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a parking garage with at least 735 spaces. Urbana Varro Hospitality Management Company, which operates the Sheraton, notified the Texas Workforce Commission that the hotel will close on Feb. 15, resulting in 110 layoffs.\nLoews spokesperson Lisa Garland declined to provide detailed construction timelines but hinted at an announcement in January. Marty Wieder, director of the Arlington EDC, confirmed the layoffs are tied to redevelopment plans and emphasized the strength of Arlington\u2019s hospitality market. He noted that displaced workers should find opportunities at other growing hotel properties in the area.\nThe financial agreement approved in 2023 includes $5 million from the EDC for site improvements, $15 million over seven years for the garage, and $20 million from the city over eight years for garage costs. Additional grants of $3.8 million over 10 years and $1.3 million over 14 years will be provided once the hotel opens.\nThe Loews project is part of a broader wave of hotel development and renovation in Arlington\u2019s Entertainment District. The\n$54 million Caravan Court\n, a 145\u2011key upscale hotel on Division Street, is under construction and expected to open by the 2026 World Cup. Meanwhile, the Crowne Plaza Suites Arlington, owned by Equinox Hospitality, is undergoing a $9 million renovation to update 200 rooms and common areas, while converting its indoor pool into 5,000 square feet of meeting space. The city has entered a 10\u2011year agreement to provide $3.25 million in support between 2025 and 2027.\nThe projects underscore\nArlington\u2019s push\nto expand its hospitality infrastructure, positioning the city as a destination for business events and tourism with a strategic location halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar expanded its presence in Irving, Texas, buying an office building that was once the headquarters for jewelry retailer Zales.\nThe new Caterpillar site, about three miles from its current headquarters at Williams Square, will provide additional workspace and serve as a venue for hosting dealers, customers and visitors, according to\nThe Dallas Morning News\n. Financial details of the sale were not disclosed, but Dallas Central Appraisal District records value the 15\u2011acre property at 901 West Walnut Hill Lane at $51.5 million, although tax valuations often lag behind market prices.\nCoppell\u2011based office maker Vari sold the property, formerly called VariSpace Las Colinas, after acquiring it in 2019. Originally built in 1982 as the headquarters for Zales, the complex includes three office buildings totaling more than 400,000 square feet, along with a four\u2011level parking garage. At its peak, the site accommodated nearly 3,000 employees. Zales is now part of Signet Jewelers based in Akron, Ohio.\nOn its website, VariSpace calls the Las Colinas property a \u201cfully furnished turnkey office space\u201d with an onsite 7,000-square-foot cafe and lobby coffee bar, a conference and training center, a Wi-Fi enabled park and a 10,000-square-foot fitness center. Two recent leases at the property include a\nMUFG Bank renewal\nand the\nUniversity of St. Augustine for Health Sciences\n.\nCaterpillar relocated its\nglobal headquarters\nfrom Deerfield, Illinois, to the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market in 2022. The company currently employs more than 800 people at Williams Square and about 6,600 statewide. Caterpillar has maintained a presence in Texas since the 1960s.\nLast year\nthe company added about 50,000 square feet to its Williams Square space.\nWith reported revenue of $64.8 billion in 2024, Caterpillar is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off\u2011highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel\u2011electric locomotives. Led by CEO Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d Creed, Caterpillar currently ranks 64th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the United States.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry spent\nmillions of dollars\ntrying to prevent Zohran Mamdani from becoming mayor. The effort failed.\nMeanwhile, some working in the industry\nmade comparatively modest donations\nto Mamdani\u2019s campaign.\nThe latest campaign finance filings show that after the election, some of those donors and others in the industry contributed to the mayor-elect\u2019s transition efforts, giving at least $40,900 between Nov. 5 and Nov. 30. That represents less than 2 percent of the $2.6 million Mamdani took in during that time.\nRepresentatives for Mamdani indicated that donations through Dec. 5, which go beyond the city\u2019s filing period, have reached more than $3 million. The funds, according to the representatives, help pay for staff and operations as Mamdani prepares to take office.\nThe real estate-related donations include anyone who identified themselves as working in development, construction, architecture, property management or brokerage.\nA number of these real estate donors previously gave to Mamdani\u2019s campaign, including Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman, who donated tens of thousands of dollars to a pro-Mamdani political action committee ahead of the election. Washington, D.C.,-area developer Joseph Kaempfer, developer Craig Harwood and LCOR\u2019s David Sigman all contributed to Mamdani\u2019s campaign ahead of the general election and also donated to transition efforts.\nFriedman and Kaempfer each gave $3,700, while Harwood gave $2,000 and Sigman $250.\nAlbany-based developer Faraz Khan and New Jersey investor Mustafa Ladha each contributed $3,700.\nJRT Realty\u2019s Jodi Pulice, who donated $400 to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s mayoral campaign before the primary, contributed $2,000 to Mamdani\u2019s transition. JRT previously worked as a subcontractor on the city\u2019s commercial leases, which became the subject of a\nlegal fight\nthis year.\nIn May, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services issued a request for proposals\nseeking up to five brokerages\nto represent the agency on leasing and buying office properties.\nTwo weeks ago, Mamani\nnamed\n24 people to his transition committee on housing. Members hailed from housing organizations, unions, Yimby groups, tenant groups and private real estate companies. We don\u2019t yet know who the mayor-elect will tap to lead the city\u2019s housing-related agencies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who would you like to see lead the Department of Housing Preservation and Development? City Planning? The Department of Buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Housing groups warn that\nfour bills\nthat set various requirements for city-funded housing would increase the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs by $545 million per year. In a letter to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Council member Rafael Salamanca, who chairs the Committee on Land Use, the New York Housing Conference, Citizens Housing and Planning Council and others urged against passing Intros. 958, 1433, 1437 and 1443. Three of the bills set citywide minimum percentages for city-funded housing, creating floors for the amount of homes affordable to extremely and very low-income tenants, two- and three-bedroom units and homeownership units. Another caps the percentage of studio apartments built in senior housing projects.\nThe housing groups argue that those measures, along with a separate bill that would set minimum construction wages on certain city-funded projects, would increase HPD\u2019s budget needs by $1.3 billion. Supporters of the wage bill, known as the Construction Justice Act, have objected to estimates of that bill\u2019s cost, saying that they grossly overshoot the potential added cost.\nThe clock is ticking for all of these bills, as the last City Council meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Port Authority police captured a horse at the entrance to JFK\u2019s Terminal 1 on Sunday night, after receiving reports that the runaway animal was seen on the JFK Expressway,\nGothamist reports\n. The equine, known as Sundance, had escaped from Curly\u2019s Cowboy Center in Southeast Queens, located less than a mile from the airport.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama, will move into Gracie Mansion next month. \u201cThis decision came down to our family\u2019s safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$21 million\nfor a condominium unit at 70 Vestry Street. The Tribeca condo unit is 3,200 square feet and last sold in 2023 for $15.5 million.\nCompass\u2019\nJared Schwadron has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$488.4 million\nfor 35 Hudson Yards. Related Companies and Oxford Properties sold a 38-story portion, which includes retail, office and hospitality space, to Japan\u2019s Mori Trust,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10.8 million for a condo unit at 1165 Madison Avenue. The 2,700-square-foot condo at The Bellemont last sold in 2023 for $8.8 million.\nCompass\u2019\nDane Gray and Caleb Loftus have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 92,273-square-foot, nine-story mixed-use building at 1383 Brooklyn Avenue in East Flatbush. Claudia Goudas of EQ Architecture is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Mendel Deutsch of Toms River, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty to one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for his role in a brazen commercial mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn.\nDeutsch pleaded guilty in November, just a few weeks after one of the co-conspirators, Joshua Feldberger of the title insurer Universal Abstract, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.\nThe Department of Justice accused Deutsch and Feldberger of assisting in a scheme with Arthur Spitzer to buy and sell properties and obtain mortgages on properties they did not own.\nProsecutors alleged Spitzer orchestrated the scheme in 2019 and 2020 by identifying properties in New Jersey or Brooklyn without mortgages or mortgages below the property\u2019s market value. The trio would make it appear like Spitzer owned three properties in Brooklyn and had agreed to sell them to Deutsch, who then took out a $4.5 million loan on the transaction, according to the DOJ.\nThe scheme involved multiple bad acts: The defendants allegedly created and sent letters stating that Deutsch had deposited escrow funds to close on the transaction, created fake documents showing the properties transferred to Spitzer and lied to the mortgage lender, stating Universal received more than $2 million from Deutsch at closing, causing the lender, Connect One Bank, to fund the loan.\nDeutsch\u2019s plea comes amid a crackdown by the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency into mortgage fraud. The agencies are targeting deals in which the borrowers sold properties to related parties or inflated building financials to obtain larger loans than they otherwise would have received.\nBut the scheme at the heart of the allegations against Spitzer, Deutsch and Feldberger is particularly bold since Spitzer and Deutsch never owned the properties. Deutsch even used the fraudulent loan proceeds to fund an actual down payment on the same properties.\n(The Brooklyn properties were owned by entities tied to Dahlia Kalter, civil court records show. Kalter\u2019s husband is Mark Nordlicht, who ran the infamous hedge fund Platinum Partners and was found guilty of securities fraud by a jury in New York federal court and given six months of house arrest.)\nDeutsch also fraudulently obtained about $1.8 million of government loans intended for small businesses during the pandemic. The businesses tied to these loans had little or no operations. He also submitted false statements about the number of employees, revenues, cost of goods sold and lost rents, according to prosecutors.\nAt a hearing in November in which Deutsch pleaded guilty, he told U.S. Judge Edward Kiel in Camden, New Jersey, that the highest level of education he had completed was the eighth grade. He stated his last job was as a salesman selling doors and hardware, which he held for 18 years.\nDeutsch, 39, faces a maximum sentence of up to 50 years and a maximum fine of $1.25 million, although he will likely be sentenced to far less. Deutsch is scheduled to be sentenced on March 16, 2026.\nSpitzer has pleaded not guilty.\nAn attorney for Deutsch did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Amityville is pumping the brakes on its apartment boom.\nAfter a half decade of rapid multifamily growth, village officials want a six-month moratorium on new apartments, condos and townhomes while they study whether the surge has pushed local services to a breaking point, Newsday\nreported\n.\nThe proposed pause would block approvals or construction of any building with three or more units, Mayor Michael O\u2019Neill said. The village of about 10,000 people has the option to extend the moratorium another six months if needed and is set to take public comment Monday at Village Hall.\nAmityville\u2019s wave of development was encouraged in part by a $10 million Downtown Revitalization Initiative grant from the state in 2022, which included increased rental housing as a pillar of that revitalization.\nBut the buildout moved quickly: the village has added 500 new multiple \u201cdwelling units\u201d in the past five years, which amounts to a 20% increase over the total number, according to the proposed legislation. More than 300 came online in 2023 at AvalonBay Communities\u2019 Broadway complex.\nAvalonBay floated a second luxury building across the street while the first project was still leasing up, but scrapped the idea after local pushback. Even so, O\u2019Neill said developers continue knocking and the village keeps uncovering five to eight previously unregistered rentals each month. The moratorium, he said, is meant to \u201cmake sure we don\u2019t oversaturate the village.\u201d\nThe pressure isn\u2019t theoretical. Soon after the AvalonBay complex opened, village police and fire crews responded to nearly two dozen false alarms tied to what the developer described as construction glitches.\nOfficials also say they need better data \u2014 on occupancy, rents, traffic and infrastructure impacts \u2014 to gauge how the influx of renters is reshaping the village. Officials plan to tap internal staff and hire an outside firm through a request for proposals to run that analysis.\nResidents say the pause is overdue. Joan Donnison, president of the Bay Village Civic Association, told the outlet she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the proposal and said the village is at \u201ca tipping point\u201d as it tries to balance revitalization with quality of life. She credited the housing influx for boosting downtown energy but said the community needs a clearer picture of how much more it can absorb.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Alec Baldwin has been\ntrying to sell\nhis Amagansett home for more than three years. But instead of knocking down the price \u2014 the logical move for stuck sellers \u2014 Baldwin is raising it.\nThe actor\u2019s home at 355 Town Lane in the Hamptons community is back on the market for $21 million, Newsday\nreported\n. The property was taken off the market a little more than a year ago, when it was available for $19 million.\nIt would be natural to think the elevated price accompanies an upgraded offering, but that isn\u2019t the case, according to Saunders &amp; Associates\u2019 Scott Bradley, the listing agent for the 10-acre estate.\nThe biggest development appears to be the home\u2019s role in a TLC reality show detailing the family lives of Baldwin, his wife and their children. But even seeing Baldwin at the home is not unprecedented for viewers, since he\ncut a two-minute video\nin early 2024 trying to hawk the home.\nBaldwin purchased the estate in 1995 for $1.7 million. Since then, he\u2019s made two additions, bringing the property\u2019s main home to 9,000 square feet. The property is approved for the construction of another home of similar size, as well as expanding the existing five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house.\nOther features of the home include two upper-level balconies, a wood-paneled library, a wine-tasting room and movie theater. The backyard features a pool with a spa, surrounded by a pavilion and stone fireplace. There\u2019s also private beach access.\nBaldwin listed the property in September 2022 for\n$29 million\n. At the start of 2023, he\ncut the price\nto $25 million, before reducing it again two months later to $22.5 million and then down to $19 million before it was taken off the market.\nIn other Baldwin dealings, the actor and his wife, Hilaria, sold their lake house upstate in 2022 for $530,000. He was also reportedly shopping his\npenthouse in Greenwich Village\nin Manhattan last year.\nRural life is the life for the Baldwins, it seems: the couple bought a 55-acre farm in Arlington, Vermont, for $1.7 million several years ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Other downtown property investors will likely be spooked by the selloff, which could trigger a domino effect, some insiders told the Journal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really heartbreaking signal to other owners in the central business district,\u201d Norman Miller, a real estate professor emeritus at the University of San Diego, told WSJ. Despite the national office market showing some signs of a comeback, much of the activity is centralized in major cities like New York and\nSan Francisco\n.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the San Diegos of the world fit that bill,\u201d Dylan Burzinski, a research analyst at real estate advisory firm Green Street, said.\nA spokesperson for Irvine Company said that the firm is still investing in San Diego, but is shifting its focus to other higher-growth markets in the city, such as La Jolla and University Town Center, as it leaves downtown. \u201cInvestment activity is shifting toward stronger submarkets,\u201d commercial real estate firm Kidder Mathews said in its third-quarter report cited by WSJ.\nIrvine Company began snapping up well-known office towers in San Diego in 2003 and eventually became the city\u2019s biggest office landlord. At the time, San Diego\u2019s economy was in the midst of growing beyond the defense industry as demand for high-quality office space increased. But with the onset of the pandemic and widespread adoption of work-from-home policies \u2014 and subsequent slow\nreturns to office\n\u2014 the local market began to suffer.\nThe firm started selling off parts of its six-building downtown San Diego portfolio last year. In October, it completed its exit with the\nsale of One America Plaza\n, the city\u2019s tallest building, for $120 million \u2014 more than 50 percent below Irvine Company\u2019s $300 million purchase price for the 650,000-square-foot property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The other two that Zurich bought were a 131,000-square-foot building in the\nCherry Creek area of Denver\nthat fetched $52 million, and the 50,000-square-foot building at 58 Charles Street in Cambridge outside of Boston.\n\u201cIf you can pick these really interesting nodes inside these markets that have a dynamism and vibrancy, you can see where there is traffic and people returning to the office. We\u2019re trying to pick the right nodes,\u201d said Sean Bannon, head of U.S. real estate for Zurich, which has its North American headquarters just northwest of Chicago in\nSchaumburg\n.\nHe said Zurich wants to get back into the San Francisco office market, where it lost some bids to buy property earlier this year. It previously owned and operated a portfolio of boutique office buildings in San Francisco during the 2010s that it sold in late 2019, just before the pandemic rocked values. He wants to return to the market with a purchase in 2026, he told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are finding a lot to like about office pricing in premium locations in good markets, particularly the discounts to replacement cost,\u201d Bannon said, adding it bought all three offices without using debt to fund the purchases.\nThe Chicago deal consists of a 32,000-square-foot building that L3 bought back in 2019 and since remodeled into a modern office building, with Live Nation as its anchor tenant. L3 paid a total of more than $19 million for it, along with the building at 932 West Randolph Street. It bought the properties from Fifth Third Bank, which closed branches in the buildings after it acquired MB Financial. The $19 million purchase also included a parking lot at 1020 West Lake Street.\nL3 used a $13.8 million construction loan from CIBC that it took out in 2022 to redevelop the building at 1020 West Randolph, property records show. The total cost of the project isn\u2019t clear, and L3 didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nL3 has been a serial investor in Fulton Market\n, where it also teamed up with LaSalle Investment Management on the popular\nTime Out Market food hall\non Fulton Market Street. The partners sold it in 2023 for $35 million to the wealthy Italian family of the global spirits brand Campari Group.\nPhair and Lanni\u2019s firm also has investments in the\nGold Coast\n, Lincoln Park, Lakeview and State Street in the Loop, among other out-of-state markets such as New York City and Miami.",

The property has sat empty since Foot Locker closed in 2020.\nThe sale follows other bargain transactions along State Street, including an $8.3 million deal at State and Madison streets\nin October\n.\nThe sale represents a major financial loss for Calmwater, which took control of the building in 2023 through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Sterling Organization, the previous owner which has other\nChicagoland retail woes\n, surrendered the property rather than pay off an $18.3 million mortgage. Calmwater did not comment on the deal.\nThe buyer, Downtown Islamic Center, took the opportunity to acquire a property to accommodate its growing congregation. The mosque already owns a building at 231 South State Street and had long sought additional space. Chairman Mohammed Kaiseruddin said the new facility will expand services for downtown congregants, including Sunday school for children, adult religious education and interfaith activities.\nBroker Ross Modjeska of McCaffery Interests, who represented the mosque, noted that given current market conditions, such deals are rare, and the organization was fortunate to act quickly.\nSVN Chicago Commercial brokers Chad Schroedl and Scott Maesel represented Calmwater in the deal.\nThe transaction highlights the challenges facing Chicago\u2019s Loop retail market. Nearly five years after the onset of the pandemic, downtown foot traffic remains depressed, remote work has reduced downtown activity and vacancy rates hover at about 26 percent, according to Stone Real Estate. These conditions have driven down property values, creating opportunities for buyers with local market knowledge. However, in the\nChicagoland suburbs\nretail has found a solid footing in tandem with residential development.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

The\nSan Francisco\n-based environmental group Pacific Forest Trust sold the land for $2.4 million, or $2,678 per acre.\nThe Mariposa-based tribe purchased it using funding from the California Natural Resources Agency, which has a program to help tribes acquire land.\nThe property has one house on it and was previously zoned for up to 19 ranchettes.\nThe Pacific Forest Trust bought most of the land in 2004 from a family that had owned it since 1925.\nThe trust intended to expand Yosemite National Park to the original boundaries proposed by John Muir in the 1880s. That proposed expansion was supported by the Mariposa County Board of Supervisors and the superintendent of Yosemite.\nLocated near the intersection of Wawona and Glacier Point Roads, the acreage is packed with cedar, white fir and sugar pine trees with views across the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Merced River.\nThe Southern Sierra Miwuks were driven out of the area in the 1850s as soldiers, settlers and miners moved into the Yosemite area during the\nGold Rush\n. The Ferguson Fire in 2018 charred parts of the property; the Pacific Forest Trust replanted 125,000 native trees to help restore it and began discussing a potential sale with the Southern Sierra Miwuk.\n\u201cHaving this significant piece of our ancestral Yosemite land back will bring our community together to celebrate tradition and provide a healing place for our children and grandchildren,\u201d said Sandra Chapman, tribal council chairwoman of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. The land will be used as \u201ca sanctuary for our people,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s the latest land transfer deal in California as more\nNative American tribes\nwork in tandem with environmental groups and state agencies to recover land that was once theirs. In May, the state completed the\nlargest-ever transfer of land\nto a Native American tribe in California history when the Yurok Tribe, using $56 million in funds raised from public and private sources, acquired a 47,100-acre parcel of land along the lower Klamath River, including the Blue Creek watershed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The multifamily market in Oakland continues to face anemic property values, as evidenced by the two latest deals for apartment properties in the East Bay city. The deals are part of a broader wave of multifamily foreclosures and below-assessed sales that has swept the Bay Area for much of the year.\nArtHaus Partners and Belay Investment Group foreclosed on a loan that gave them ownership of nine apartment complexes totaling 268 units in Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt area for a total of $30 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The $30 million purchase amount, or about $111,940 per unit, is 68 percent lower than the combined assessed value of the nine residential properties as of this January, per Alameda County Assessor\u2019s Office data cited by the Mercury News.\n\u201cThe combination of being in the early innings of a tech cycle and the Oakland market having bottomed out makes this the ideal time to invest,\u201d Riaz Taplin, founder and CEO of ArtHaus Partners, said. The company\u2019s \u201cnear-term priorities include stabilizing the assets by renovating and leasing the currently vacant units.\u201d\nIn a separate deal, South Bay investors Krishna Koganti and Seetaram Vemulapalli spent $21 million for the 83-unit Amelia apartment complex in Pill Hill after a lender previously foreclosed on the multifamily property. In October last year, SREC Amelia Owner foreclosed on the loan that financed The Amelia apartments; at the time, the unpaid debt totaled $23 million. The purchase by Koganti and Vemulapalli was at 8.7 percent less than its debt in last year\u2019s foreclosure; on a per-unit basis, the transaction works out to about $253,000 per residence \u2014 a low per-unit price for East Bay apartments this year.\nIn October, Madison Realty Capital began the\nforeclosure process on The Fay\n, a 363-unit, 23-story apartment tower in San Jose, after its developer Murro defaulted on a $182.5 million construction loan. That property opened to residents late last year. And in July, the University Park apartment complex in Berkeley\nheaded to a foreclosure auction\nafter Academy West Investments\ndefaulted on payments\ntied to the apartment complex.\nElsewhere in the East Bay, in August, an Abacus Capital Group affiliate paid $98.3 million for the 259-unit\nPark Central Apartments\nin Concord, working out to $379,500 per unit, or a total property value 24.7 percent lower than its assessed value of $130.5 million.\nThe\nAtrium Downtown apartments\nin Walnut Creek sold to a Fresno-based investor group led by Valley Yellow Pages CEO Siegfried Fischer, which bought the 78-unit property from Sequoia Equities for $31 million \u2014 down 3.4 percent from the complex\u2019s most recently assessed value of $32.1 million for a per-unit price of $397,400.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Tetra Technologies\u2019 current headquarters is at a seven-story, 171,000-square-foot office building at 24955 Interstate 45 North. It was built in 2008.\nNewmark\u2019s David Baker, Elliott Hirshfeld and Kristen Baker are the leasing agents for San Francisco-based Spear Street. Tetra Technologies was represented by Flatrock Commercial Real Estate Group\u2019s Caleb Lawson.\nTetra Technologies will occupy space in the South Tower of the two-building, 564,000-square-foot office property. The campus was built in 2014, and is about 26 miles north of downtown Houston. It\u2019s also home to Expand Energy, which has a full-building lease at the 279,000-square-foot North Tower.\nSpear Street bought 1000 Energy Drive in 2019, deed records show. It was valued at $142.7 million for property tax purposes in 2025, according to appraisal district data.\nHouston\u2019s battered office market\nis continuing its slow recovery, logging a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the third quarter. That number increased to 639,000 square feet, Newmark reported, bringing the year\u2019s total net absorption of office space to 1.2 million square feet. Partners Real Estate put the market vacancy at 26.3 percent at the end of the third quarter, a slight dip from the previous quarter.\nThere\u2019s a bright side to the distress that\u2019s befallen Houston\u2019s aging office buildings. Valuations have dropped for these older properties to the extent that buying is more appealing than leasing for some office users. As a result, the number of\nowner-user deals\nhas risen, providing a much needed boost to the sluggish market.\n",

        "content": "Everyone knew\nthe switch from 421a to 485x would mean fewer large multifamily projects.\nTurns out, it\u2019s not as bad as expected. It\u2019s worse.\nThe new tax abatement has not merely reduced the number of mixed-income projects with 100 or more units. It has eliminated them.\nSince the state enacted 485x in April 2024 with a wage floor for projects with 100 or more units \u2014 at the behest of construction union leader Gary LaBarbera \u2014 exactly zero such projects have registered for the program.\nFourteen of the 180 projects seeking the abatement would have exactly 99 units, but the average unit count is only 31, according to an analysis by the Real Estate Board of New York of the\nlatest data\n(through October 31). Of the 5,546 total units, just 350 will be in Manhattan.\nClearly, the housing crisis has no end in sight.\nWhen it comes to housing supply, large projects carry the freight \u2014 even with the de facto cap imposed by 485x. The program\u2019s 99-unit projects make up just 8 percent of the buildings but 25 percent of the units.\nUnder the expired 421a, projects of 100 or more units yielded 59 percent of the homes, the NYU Furman Center\nfound\n.\nHowever, some 100-plus-unit projects are still being built in New York City. Because of the way all-affordable housing is funded and taxed, it pencils out without the 485x property tax break and is not subject to 485x\u2019s union-friendly wage floor.\nThis might sound like a good thing to activists who want more affordable and less market-rate housing built. But they are wrong.\nThe supply shortage can only be fixed if both affordable and market-rate development are firing on all cylinders. Reducing the latter does not produce more of the former. They are different animals. Shrinking the elephant population does not increase the mouse population.\nAffordable projects typically require piecing together a bewildering array of funding sources \u2014 Low Income Housing Tax Credits, project-based vouchers, grants and loans from city, state and federal agencies, foundation money and more.\nThis Syracuse project\nhas at least seven.\nThe timelines are longer because of the bureaucracy involved. The fee structure is different, as are the buildings themselves. For example, rooms in affordable housing must be larger. And units are rented via housing lotteries, not a standard leasing office.\nMany developers don\u2019t build affordable housing for the same reason that brain surgeons don\u2019t do knee replacements. Instead, they do certain kinds of projects again and again, allowing them to gain expertise, increase efficiency and reduce risk.\nLast month I ran into a developer who builds\nlarge multifamily projects\nbut only as-of-right. He has no experience with rezonings and doesn\u2019t plan to try one. Another firm, after a\ncontroversy\n, sticks to\nrehabbing empty buildings\n.\nNothing has been gained by stopping developers from building large, market-rate projects and the investors and lenders who fund them. All New York City is getting is less housing.\nAn activist might ask: Doesn\u2019t 485x\u2019s de facto ban on 100-unit projects allow affordable developers to outcompete market-rate ones for larger sites? Not really.\nIn many neighborhoods, rents are high enough that developers of sub-100-unit, 485x projects win the bidding for parcels zoned for more than 99 units. Sometimes they plan two or three \u201cseparate\u201d sub-100-unit projects, avoiding the 485x wage floor.\nEven if these midsize projects dried up, affordable development would still be limited by finite subsidies and the capacity of agencies that administer them.\nThe real estate industry and YIMBY groups need to get this message to Albany, and fast. The state legislative session kicks off next month and ends in early June. If 485x\ndoesn\u2019t get fixed\nby then, it\u2019s \u201cWait \u2019til next year,\u201d as Brooklyn Dodgers fans used to say.\nThey should explain that expanding 485x beyond 100 units won\u2019t snuff out all-affordable projects, which in some areas are the only ones that pencil out.\nConsider the Jay Group\u2019s attempt to\ndefy the odds\nand build a mostly market-rate project under 485x\u2019s predecessor (421a) at 2886 Atlantic Avenue in East New York. The developer couldn\u2019t lease enough market-rate units at the rents it needed ($2,500 to $3,000 for one-bedrooms), so it sold the project to Camber Property Group and the nonprofit Institute for Community Living, who turned it into a subsidized, all-affordable project.\nIf I were a civic-minded developer, I wouldn\u2019t rely on REBNY or lobbying firms to make the case. I\u2019d meet with as many Assembly and Senate Democrats as possible, so when they conference with chamber leaders to decide on an agenda, 485x has a shot to be included.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll remain stuck at ground zero.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the inaugural edition of Erik Engquist\u2019s newsletter Reality Check, which aims to cut through the political spin and rhetoric that plague the real estate industry.\n",

The 37\u2011acre mixed\u2011use project is designed to transform the area with 880,000 square feet of office space, 238,000 square feet of retail, 1,785 apartments and a 175\u2011key hotel.\nThe first phase of construction is expected to begin in early 2026 and finish by 2028. Fort Worth City Council already\napproved incentives\nin June, including a Chapter 380 grant and tax increment financing for FW Westside RE Investors, with grants spread over 15 years. The developers are now seeking additional support from the Near Westside TIF District.\nIn Texas, TIF financing leverages the increases in property value to fund infrastructure projects. Infrastructure at the Westside Village project will include roads, utilities and streetscaping.\nTo qualify for the incentives, developers must meet strict requirements. The first phase must involve at least $410 million in investment, with $311 million in hard construction costs spent by the end of 2030. Minimum build\u2011out requirements include 200,000 square feet of office space, 95,000 square feet of retail and a hotel with at least 150 rooms.\nWestside Village is one of several megadevelopments in Fort Worth. The list includes Brown Ranch from\nHines\nand Goldenrod Company\u2019s\nVan Zandt project\n.\nBass, the billionaire nephew of late oilman Sid Richardson, has decades of experience developing houses and commercial buildings.

        "content": "At his Douglas Enclave apartment building in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, developer Henry Torres cut rents for some of the 199 units. Yet, his bottom line took no hit.\nAfter completing the project in 2023, Torres decreased annual rates by an average of $3,000 and recouped the loss through a roughly $4,500 property tax break per reduced unit awarded by the\nLive Local Act\n. The total: about $450,000 in savings from his $950,000 tax bill this year.\nThe rent break also helped him fill the building faster. Amid South Florida\u2019s stubbornly persistent and pervasive\naffordability crisis\n, tenants are on the hunt for a reprieve.\n\u201cIt definitely got a lot more smiles on people\u2019s faces. I can tell you that. People are struggling right now, especially the blue collar class,\u201d said Torres, founder of the Coral Gables-based Astor Companies. \u201cIt helped us tremendously to get units rented faster.\u201d\nHe\u2019s no anomaly. South Florida apartment developers and landlords seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that incentivizes landlords to include\nworkforce\nunits at their buildings. Although much of the industry buzz has been over the law\u2019s main perk for\nlarger projects\n, its less touted bonus \u2013\u2013\nproperty tax breaks\n\u2013\u2013 is already reshaping the multifamily market.\nUnder the legislation, landlords who finished projects in the past five years and designate at least 71 units as workforce or affordable get a carrot: a 75 percent tax abatement for apartments reserved for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the area median income, and 100 percent tax relief for apartments for tenants earning less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nAcross South Florida, at least 48 properties qualified this year, according to data provided by the property appraisers for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Many weren\u2019t planned as Live Local and were built before the law existed, and the developers brought the apartments under the state law\u2019s purview retroactively to tap into its tax breaks.\nIt came at a critical time. Over the past two years, demand slowed compared to recent years\u2019 boom, requiring concessions, and costs increased across the board.\n\u201cDevelopers are looking at projects and saying, \u2018Alright, property insurance is going up, property taxes are going up. How do we offset things?\u2019\u201d said Matthew Scott, a Greenspoon Marder land use and zoning attorney. \u201cThey run the math and Live Local gives the tax benefit, so that\u2019s less money they have to pay.\u201d\nLive Local math\nCoral Rock Development Group completed the 204-unit Metropolitan in Coral Springs last year, a dicey time for multifamily.\nAfter years of record in-migration and rent growth, developers jumped on the bonanza with new projects. By the time they completed a record\n18,600 mostly market-rent units\nlast year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, the influx of out-of-staters had slowed and some transplants had\nreturned home\n.\nLease-ups slowed.\nCoral Springs wasn\u2019t as overbuilt with apartments as other submarkets, but Coral Rock still converted Metropolitan, planned as market-rate apartments, to workforce via Live Local. The building reached full lease-up this fall with roughly 160 apartments for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, charging about $350 less per month than market-rate units at the Metropolitan.\n\u201cWe determined through metric analysis that we would accelerate leasing and not lose money,\u201d said Coral Rock\u2019s Michael Wohl. \u201cYou need to lease-up faster and stabilize faster, so you can be eligible for permanent financing.\u201d\nFor the math to pencil out, landlords ensure tax savings offset reduced rents. The delta between market rents and workforce rents can\u2019t be too big, a condition far more common in suburbs far from the glitz of coastal neighborhoods that command top rates.\nOut of the 28 Miami-Dade properties that received a Live Local tax break this year, 19 are in suburban areas. Hialeah, a western city that\u2019s traditionally been a bedroom community offering cheaper housing, is home to nine.\nIMC Equity Group\u2019s Carlos Segrega said Live Local won\u2019t work for properties in Coral Gables.\n\u201cThe income demographics are higher,\u201d Segrera said. But \u201cif the market [rent] is at $3,000 and you can lease it at $2,700 \u2026 now the pro-forma pencils.\u201d\nAt IMC Equity\u2019s 340-unit\nThe Upland in Hialeah\n, about 80 units qualified for the abatement, Segrera said.\nAt other Hialeah properties, the market rent already is at the rate for earners of 120 percent of the AMI. Such was the case with the 260-unit\nPura Vida Hialeah\n, which Coral Rock qualified for the tax break before selling it earlier this year.\n\u201cYou are not losing money on the rents, and correspondingly, you are getting the abatement,\u201d Wohl said. \u201cSo you\u2019d be an idiot not to.\u201d\nWorkforce rentals specialist Affiliated Development received the tax break on four properties this year, without lowering rents since it already developed them underwriting below-market rates. The abatement covered unexpected increases in overhead.\n\u201cIt was necessary because of the dramatic spike in operating cost. Insurance doubled. Materials, for when you turn a unit, skyrocketed,\u201d said Nick Rojo of Affiliated. \u201cIt really helped offset those costs.\u201d\n\u201cA business to run\u201d\nThe tax reprieve comes with hurdles.\nLandlords said they try to lease as many units as possible to earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, but also can\u2019t turn away prospective tenants with higher incomes. Qualifying for the Live Local tax break can be an administrative headache. The workforce rents are based on the lower of either the rent outlined by the Florida Housing Finance Corporation or 90 percent of the market rent in the area of their project.\nLandlords have to collect tax returns or paystubs from households to confirm their incomes meet the workforce threshold.\nAnother kink is that lenders still don\u2019t recognize the tax break.\n\u201cFannie and Freddie, which is 85 percent of the permanent [financing] market, do not recognize Live Local savings, so it\u2019s really hurt people from the total financing they could get,\u201d said Alex Ruiz of Prestige Companies, which received tax abatements on four Hialeah properties this year. \u201cIf they were going to give me $10 million for a project, and with Live Local I should be able to qualify for $14 million, it doesn\u2019t matter to them. They [still] give me $10 million.\u201d\nWhile the tax breaks are bad news for counties and municipalities that rely on the revenue, developers argue it\u2019s a necessary tool for them to provide the same level of service and quality to the workforce.\nSouth Florida\u2019s affordability crisis isn\u2019t lost on landlords.\nAt her 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\nin Miami\u2019s Allapattah, developer Lissette Calderon got the tax break after reserving some apartments for the workforce, offering one bedrooms below $2,000 a month and two bedrooms in the low $2,000. These rates are \u201cunheard of in today\u2019s market,\u201d she said, adding the tax break has allowed her Neology Group firm to continue offering a coveted lifestyle with amenities like yoga classes. Otherwise, higher expenses would have dented budgets, leaving Neology with no choice but to raise rents, Calderon said.\n\u201cThis has allowed us to continue to maintain the rents we were hoping to maintain and continue that aspirational living to the engines that drive our community,\u201d she said, referring to the workforce.\nTorres, too, is cognizant renters are struggling, saying it\u2019s become normal for many South Floridians to pay half of their incomes for housing instead of the commonly accepted 30 percent, He is considering applying the Live Local tax break to some of his projects on tap.\n\u201cI have a lot of sympathy for people struggling, but I have to make sure our building makes money,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe have a business to run, too.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sotheby\u2019s International Realty landed the Walters | Plaxen Group, which packed up its seven-person team and a hefty inventory list from the Beverly Hills Estates, TRD has learned.\nThe group, which has handled more than $220 million in Los Angeles real estate sales so far this year, will be based out of the Sotheby\u2019s offices in Beverly Hills and Miami.\nThe Walters | Plaxen with career sales in excess of $1 billion, is the latest big get for Sotheby\u2019s, which earlier this year recruited\nErnie Carswell\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Carswell brought his 15-person team, Ernie Carswell &amp; Associates, to Sotheby\u2019s in May with the agent referring to the brokerage in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nat the time as being at the \u201ctop of its ilk,\u201d adding\u00a0 \u201cmy team and myself now want that type of solid track of consistency and longevity.\u201d\nCristian David, Sotheby\u2019s Southern California region executive vice president, said the brokerage\u2019s global brand is a big selling point to agents.\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s strongest professionals \u2026 want a brand that understands this marketplace\u2019s nuances, anticipates global wealth shifts and equips them with world-class tools and mentorship,\u201d David told TRD.\nWalters said as much in a statement, calling out the brokerage\u2019s \u201cglobal ecosystem.\u201d\n\u201cAs wealth expands across continents, we\u2019re expanding with it,\u201d she said.\nPlaxen added that \u201cunlocking new markets\u201d also factored into the decision to move their licenses over to a global brokerage to keep step with the movement of high-net-worth clients.\nWalters | Plaxen also includes Brooke Enwere, Christian Garcia, Yona Lador, Necole Hilbert and Milan Ciro.\nMarket \u201cstandout\u201d\nThe team brings a strong track record that has continued this year, when it joined with Beverly Hills Estates founders Branden and Rayni Williams to represent the buyers of Melhill Estate in Brentwood for $53 million in October. Walters | Plaxen also had a hand in the sale of 1414 Donhill, which was purchased by Fashion Nova\u2019s Richard Saghian for $32 million in June, and provided representation of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the November sales of his two Palisades lots at 15303 and 15309 Friends Street for $6.1 million.\nAt the top of the group\u2019s inventory was the $108 million co-listing of 1200 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air, which was removed from the market late last week. There are plans for the team to re-list the residence, according to a spokesperson.\nThere\u2019s also 9330 Flicker Way in the Bird Streets, which is asking $68 million. They\u2019re set to list 1360 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills for $53 million, 1951 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air for $88 million and 556 Catalonia in the Palisades for $40 million. The group also holds listings in Las Vegas, Miami and Thailand.\n\u201cThe Walters | Plaxen team had their biggest wins while at the Beverly Hills Estates, including several record-breaking sales,\u201d brokerage co-founder and President Branden Williams said. \u201cDuring their time here, they became a standout team, so it\u2019s no surprise the corporate giants came calling. That\u2019s just not who we are. We\u2019re a boutique brokerage built on collaboration, transparency and a culture the big firms can\u2019t replicate. It\u2019s been an honor to fuel their growth and watch their trajectory take off.\u201d\nComings and goings\nIndeed, the team\u2019s departure marks a year of changes at For the Beverly Hills Estates.\nIt landed big names such as Jaqueline Chernov from Compass and recently announced its expansion into the Palisades with a new office called\nPalisades Estates\n.\nIt\u2019s also seen some other talent leave.\nIn March, Mick Partridge left the brokerage for Carolwood Estates, bringing with him two agents and a director of operations. Carolwood also poached the\nTavangarian team\n, helmed by Shana and Emila Tavangarian. The two are the daughters of famed ulra-luxe spec developer Ardie Tavangarian. With their move, they brought along their co-listing of Villa Siena at 607 Siena Way, which was designed by their father, and listed for $177 million. The listing was shared with the Williams but has since been taken off the market.\nMore recently, in July,\nMatthew Clayman\nleft the Beverly Hills Estates as its broker of record and general manager to oversee Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. Clayman\u2019s since been on a recruiting tear, with the brokerage announcing seven new agents, including\nSeverin Braham\n, former director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group at the Beverly Hills Estates.\n",

The developer is also planning a 300-unit apartment building on part of the residential portion of the site.\nPulte Homes spent the $14 million to purchase 87 lots from Inspired for the first phase of the townhome development on Nov. 3, according to public records. The lots are on the southern end of the residential site, which was previously undeveloped land to the east of the AT&amp;T campus.\nConstruction on the townhome site broke ground in March, and the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026. After making initial land improvements, the developers received approval from the city to begin applying for building permits for phase one of the two-phase project in November.\nThe north end of the site contains about 80 more lots for townhomes that are planned for construction after the first phase is finished.\nPulte Homes did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe townhome prices will start in the low $500,000 range, according to Pulte Homes\u2019 website. They\u2019ll range from 1,900 to 2,400 square feet. The homebuilder\u2019s website lists three design plans, ranging from three to four bedrooms and two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms. Each townhome will have a two-car garage.\nInspired by Somerset has developed the Bell Works site with the goal of establishing a \u201cmetroburb,\u201d an urban-style mixed-use development in the suburbs. The developer bought the 1.2 million-square-foot property at 2000 Center Drive in 2019 for $21 million.\nThe eastern portion of the building, covering 420,000 square feet, is 98 percent leased, a Somerset spokesperson said Monday. Tenants include offices, retail and coworking spaces. Somerset is also working on developing the west side of the building, which will open an additional 430,000 square feet of office and 70,000 square feet of retail.\nHoffman Estates planning officials will consider a change to the tax-increment financing agreement for the Bell Works project in a meeting on Monday. The new agreement would allow Somerset to keep 95 percent of TIF proceeds for 15 years, up from 10 years in the existing agreement. In the last five years of the agreement, the city and Somerset would split the tax proceeds evenly.\nPulte Homes has also been building elsewhere in the Chicago suburbs, including the planned Estates of Ravinia Meadow in Orland Park. That development will include 129 new homes, with prices starting in the mid $600,000 range.\n",

The buyer is a trust, and the only listed trustee is the buyer\u2019s agent, Genna Stolnik of Compass Real Estate.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but the Highland Park home is the most expensive residential sale in Texas this year, based on information compiled by the Houston Association of Realtors.\nCrousen listed the home in February, easily taking the first spot on the list of\nthe most expensive luxury homes for sale in Texas\n, compiled by HAR from the state\u2019s foremost Multiple Listing Services.\nSince then, the home has only been outstripped in asking price by the $64 million\nCrespi Estate\nin Dallas; the $60 million\nLodge at Hunters Creek\nin Houston; and a\nUniversity Park mansion\nformerly owned by the late Fortress Investment Group CEO Joshua Pack, asking $35 million. None has sold yet.\nSitting on more than an acre, the six-bedroom, 13-bathroom Euclid Avenue home boasts one of the largest lots in Highland Park, according to listing agent Jason Garcia of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate.\nBuilt in 2015 by architect Robbie Fusch, the traditionalist manor imported its limestone floors, corniced fireplace and bronze hardware from France. A basilica-style dome, gilt in 24-carat gold leaf, caps the grand foyer. Roman pillars support an arcade belting the courtyard, which includes a fish pond fountain, a swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen and a loggia. With almost 19,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $1,700 per square foot.\nFusch also designed the most expensive listing of 2024, a\n17,700-square-foot mansion on Strait Lane modeled after the White House\nfor investor Toby Neugebauer. The \u201cWhite House of Dallas\u201d left the market this summer, apparently unpurchased, according to Dallas County records.\nOut of the state\u2019s major metros, the only sale that might rival the mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue is a\nwaterfront compound on Westlake Drive\nthat recently sold with an undisclosed asking price somewhere above $20 million.\n",

JPMorgan Chase provided the financing, converting last year\u2019s\n$430 million bridge loan\ninto a five-year term.\nThe debt deal was first reported by\nCommercial Real Estate Direct\n. Iron Hound Management\u2019s Rob Verrone arranged the deal, which came about as the property stabilized with nearly 95 percent leased, according to Bistricer.\nThere are two units available on the property\u2019s\nwebsite\n: a studio apartment for $3,000 monthly rent and a one-bedroom unit for $5,300 monthly rent.\nClipper landed the bridge loan last May, months after topping out construction on the three-building complex. That debt retired a $386 million construction loan provided by the Bank of China and SL Green shortly into the pandemic.\nThe 799,000-square-foot property, unspooled along the East River, was designed by CentraRuddy Architecture. There are 230 affordable units, as well as 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a tennis court, a game room and a pet spa.\nSL Green provided Bistricer a $70 million loan when he acquired the site with then-partner Joseph Chetrit for $25 million in 2012. Seven years later, Bistricer bought Chetrit out of the project.\nOutside of Brooklyn, Bistricer has suffered alongside his competitors when it comes to rent-stabilized properties. In the spring, Clipper sold an 83-unit apartment building with rent-stabilized units in Lincoln Square\nfor $45.5 million\n, a deep discount from the $79 million purchase price in 2017.\nBack in Greenpoint, the Jay Group recently acquired the lot at 97 West Street from Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management\nfor $130 million\n. The developer also\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor a 590-unit rental project on the site.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s bid to bring thousands of illegal basement apartments up to code is landing with a thud as housing advocates warn that proposed rules could scare off the very homeowners the program is designed to help.\nThe Department of Buildings\u2019 draft regulations \u2014 including a requirement for giant, five-inch red lettering marking basement entrances \u2014 have become a symbol of what critics describe as a burdensome approach to the pilot program, according to\nThe City\n. The signage rule specifically was mocked by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which unveiled an eight-foot banner to show just how impractical it would be.\nThe pilot is meant to give owners in designated neighborhoods a 10-year path to legalize otherwise off-the-books units without triggering the state\u2019s tougher multiple-dwelling law. In theory, tenants could remain while owners incrementally bring their apartments up to code.\nBut advocates and attorneys say the fine print exposes owners to steep penalties and tenants to displacement if owners can\u2019t meet the conditions, a dynamic that could keep already wary homeowners from enrolling.\n\u201cThis rule\u2026 would ensure that no one registers and comes out of the woodwork because it\u2019s too risky,\u201d Citizens Housing and Planning Council\u2019s Howard Slatkin told the publication. Pratt Center policy director Sylvia Morse called the rules unworkable and warned that the program is set up to \u201cfail.\u201d\nThe stumbling blocks go beyond signage. The rules require an apartment to have a full kitchen with a window, utilities and proper hookups. But owners cannot legally pull permits to install those features without first having a legal unit; that\u2019s the kind of catch-22 that doomed the city\u2019s earlier basement pilot in East New York, where not a single homeowner made it through the process.\nHPD\u2019s companion regulations also raise questions about tenant protections. While existing residents would have a nominal right to return after construction, they must have lived in the unit since April 2024 and vacate within 30 days of notice from owners. Tenant advocates say that the timeline is unrealistic for low-income renters in a market with vanishing affordability.\nBasement apartments remain essential, if risky, housing for tens of thousands of New Yorkers. After Hurricane Ida\u2019s deadly flooding, the push to bring these units above board gained urgency.\nThe Adams administration has\npaired the pilot\nwith its \u201cCity of Yes\u201d zoning push to unlock accessory dwelling units citywide. But unless DOB and HPD rework the rules in response to public feedback, the city risks repeating its 2019 failure and leaving a major source of informal housing stuck underground.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The surge in popularity of\narena-anchored mixed-use developments\nhas a late Dallas icon to thank.\nTom Hicks, who died on Saturday at the age of 79, was a pioneer in sports real estate, foreseeing the success of districts that integrate sports complexes with other uses, like offices, retail and multifamily.\nKnown for perfecting the leveraged buyout, Hicks and business partner Bobby Haas made beverage industry history when they brokered the merger of soda companies Dr. Pepper and 7Up.\nHicks spun his success into a storied career in sports ownership. He owned the\nDallas Stars\nfrom 1995 to 2011; the team won the Stanley Cup in 1999. He owned the Texas Rangers from 1998 to 2010. He also had a 50 percent stake in Liverpool Football Club from 2007 to 2010.\nAs owner of the Stars, Hicks partnered with Ross Perot Jr. to usher in the development of Victory Park, the entertainment district across Woodall Rogers Freeway from\ndowntown\n. The pair developed American Airlines Center, which opened in 2001. It\u2019s the home arena for the Stars and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\u201cThat partnership we put together in the \u201990s to build the arena\u2026 truly transformed the city,\u201d Perot\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nToday, Victory Park is part of the growing headquarters of\nY\u2019all Street\n. It will soon be home to the\nnew Goldman Sachs campus\n, which will anchor Hunt Realty\u2019s NorthEnd development.\nWhen he purchased the Texas Rangers, Hicks also bought the 270 acres around The Ballpark in Arlington. He had similar dreams of building a mixed-use development anchored by the ballpark, but that didn\u2019t happen while he owned the team.\nDuring his ownership, the Stars and the Rangers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were sold at auction.\nHicks and his wife, Cinda, were owners of the iconic Crespi Estate in Dallas\u2019 Preston Hollow. It was built in 1938 for Italian Count Pio Crespi. The Hickses added a two-story guest house and a three-story pool house. The 27,000-square-foot estate at 5619 Walnut Hill Drive consistently ranks among t\nhe state\u2019s most expensive listings\nand has since been owned by banker Andy Beal and developer Mehrdad Moayedi.\nHicks\u2019 death drew condolences from fellow Dallas sports owner Jerry Jones, who said in a statement, \u201cBeing shoulder to shoulder with him was always more than ballparks and stadiums, though. It was about personal respect, trust and friendship.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Nvidia\n\u2019s Santa Clara headquarters campus is set to grow with another hexagonal building.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company submitted an architectural review with the City of Santa Clara to build a 692,634-square-foot building at 2300 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. Nvidia owns the site, as it does with other properties in the Santa Clara area it occupies.\nThe planned office building would resemble the hexagonal shape of its other signature headquarters buildings along San Tomas Expressway and Walsh Avenue. Those two geometric buildings \u2014 dubbed \u201cVoyager\u201d and \u201cEndeavor\u201d \u2014 are across San Tomas Expressway from 11 other Nvidia headquarters buildings and two parking structures. The new hexagonal building, like the buildings across San Tomas Expressway from Voyager and Endeavor, will be connected to the starship-like headquarters buildings at 2788 and 2880 San Tomas Expressway via a pedestrian bridge, according to planning documents filed with the city. Gensler, which designed the Voyager and Endeavor buildings, is the architect for the expansion project.\nNvidia\u2019s proposed office building will sit on a 13-acre site currently home to a 10-building office and research campus, which the company\nbought earlier this year for $123 million\n. It marked one of the largest property deals of the year in the city.\nThe chip-making giant, bolstered by the exploding growth of the\nartificial intelligence sector in Silicon Valley\nand beyond, has been on a real estate tear this year, dropping more than $400 million on property surrounding its neighboring Voyager and Endeavor headquarters buildings. In July, it purchased a nearby four-building office complex at 2740 Scott Boulevard for $4.5 million. And in September, it bought a 125,000-square-foot building it was leasing at\n2701 San Tomas Expressway\nfrom Sobrato for $83.2 million.\nIn May, the company filed plans to build a separate 324,000-square-foot structure at 2400 Condensa Street, behind Voyager and Endeavor across the San Tomas Aquino Creek, to house offices, lab space and parking.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s real estate moves have largely been concentrated near its Santa Clara home, the company has also been moving into new territory \u2014 namely, its\nfirst-ever offices in San Francisco\n. Last month, the Jensen Huang-led corporation finalized a lease agreement for 45,000 square feet at 1090 Doctor Maya Angelou Lane, known as Building B of the Mission Rock mixed-use development co-owned in part by Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The complaint and suggestion departments are open.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with members of the Association for a Better New York and the Partnership for New York City. There, he reassured developers, lenders and investors that he is always open to hearing from them.\n\u201cI [assured] that my door to their feedback, their concerns and into identifying areas of collaboration will always remain open,\u201d he said during a press conference after the meeting.\nThe meeting was initiated by the mayor-elect\u2019s transition team, which also scheduled a meeting with homeless advocates later on Tuesday. At the press conference, Mamdani said ABNY CEO Emma Pfohman, the Partnership\u2019s outgoing CEO and President Kathy Wylde and its incoming head, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, helped organize the meeting.\nRoughly 20 people met with the mayor-elect Tuesday morning, including Rob Speyer, CEO of Tishman Speyer and chair of the Partnership; Nadeem Meghji, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone; Priscilla Almodovar, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jed Walentas, CEO of Two Trees and chair of the Real Estate Board of New York; Carlina Rivera, a former City Council member who recently took the helm New York State Association for Affordable Housing; and Asahi Pompey, chair of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, according to Wylde.\nTenant organizer Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, was also in attendance.\nMamdani began the meeting by citing a comment he made to the\nNew York Times\nin June, that his view on the private market\u2019s role in housing construction had evolved, and he now recognizes the \u201cvery important\u201d part it plays.\nThe meeting then touched on a number of issues that Mamdani\nbroached\nat a previous meeting with the Partnership, including his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years and his support for overhauling the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u201cI spoke not only about my continued commitment to freeze the rent for more than two million rent-stabilized tenants, but also my commitment to asking and understanding the roadblocks that they have faced in building more housing across the city and how we can ensure deeper levels of affordability, how we can partner in advocating for the resources this city deserves from the federal administration,\u201d Mamdani said at the press conference.\nHe said he spoke to attendees about the importance of reducing the time it takes to lease up affordable housing units. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he was speaking specifically about units set aside for formerly homeless individuals, but the median time to lease up such units was 235 days in fiscal year 2025, according to the\nMayor\u2019s Management Report\n.\nWhen asked about four pending City Council bills that would add new\nrequirements\nto city-funded housing, Mamdani didn\u2019t take a position. Housing groups have\nwarned\nCity Council that passing the measures, which Wylde said did not come up during the meeting, would significantly increase the cost of building housing and lead to fewer units being built.\n\u201cMy focus is on building as much housing as we can across the city, and I will stay in conversation with the City Council on the proposals they put forward,\u201d Mamdani said.\nWylde said the group discussed the need to fund renovations of rent-stabilized apartments that are being kept off the market, though no specific ideas emerged. Still, she felt the meeting was \u201cvery constructive.\u201d\n\u201cHe was taking notes the whole meeting,\u201d Wylde said. \u201cI think he was listening and was very interested in what everyone had to say.\u201d\n",

The sentence could ultimately stretch up to 10 years.\nConover was\narrested\nin March following a police chase in his Jeep, according to court documents. A local police officer tried to de-escalate the situation after multiple attempted stops, only for Conover to drive into the cop, throwing him 40 feet, then embarking on another chase that was ended by state police.\nThe police officer ended up in the hospital with a leg injury.\nConover\u2019s appearances in court created more noise over his legal future.\nBefore his arraignment\n, Conover said that \u201cif anyone dares try to test my mental competence, I will eviscerate every single person with my intelligence right now.\u201d He also claimed to be the victim of a police sting.\nAfter a closed-door competency hearing and a 30-day stint at a mental health facility, Conover was deemed competent for trial. In September, however, his attorney filed a notice of insanity defense, arguing before sentencing that Conover had bipolar disorder and suffered from a manic episode during the March incident.\n\u201cThis is not the outcome I hoped for, and not the outcome that reflects the severity of what happened,\u201d Bartlett Police officer Cameron Emmett said in a victim impact statement. \u201cA police officer being run down during the course of duty is not a minor incident.\u201d\nConover\u2019s YouTube channel showcases ultra-luxury listings across New York City, Aspen and Miami, among others.\nThe 36-year-old launched his internet fame as a travel vlogger, then\nventured into real estate\nafter collaborating on a listing video with Ryan Serhant in 2018. After obtaining his real estate license two years later, he joined Nest Seekers and received $100 million in listings from the firm\u2019s chief executive officer, Eddie Shapiro.\nConover is no longer licensed with Nest Seekers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "After the pandemic fueled an industrial building boom, developers are finding buyers for newly completed projects.\nThe development arm of Transwestern, known as Transwestern Development Company, last week sold a 255,000-square-foot distribution center in the Chicago suburbs to an Asian food wholesaler for $33.5 million, public records show. The sale price equates to $131 per square foot.\nThe buyer was JFC International, which is based in Los Angeles, according to the property\u2019s latest deed.\nThough total development costs are unclear, Houston-based Transwestern likely did well on the sale. The company bought the land for the property at 4101 Canterfield Parkway East in West Dundee for $2 million in 2022 and took out a $21 million construction loan from Comerica Bank shortly afterward, according to Kane County public records. No other loans have been publicly recorded against the property, which is known as the TDC I-90 Logistics Center.\nThe property likely benefits from Chicago\u2019s robust rail network as well as its proximity to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The distribution center is about 20 miles from O\u2019Hare and 40 miles from downtown Chicago.\nThough\nfears of oversupply in Chicago\u2019s industrial market\nwere percolating last year, by the halfway point of this year, absorption rates began to tell a different story.\nIn the second quarter, speculative industrial\ndevelopment overtook built-to-suit projects\nfor the first time since early 2024, according to NAI Hiffman.\nAt the same time, the region saw an absorption rate of 1 million square feet, indicating leasing activity is still outpacing vacancies, NAI Hiffman found. The region\u2019s vacancy rate has hovered between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent since 2024.\nPending and recently completed sales indicate supply is still matching demand, even if activity has slowed somewhat since a pandemic-era peak.\nOn Chicago\u2019s Southwest side, local firm Bridge Industrial is under contract to buy Ford City Mall with a $150 million plan to demolish the 960,000-square-foot shopping center and\nreplace it with a four-building logistics complex\nspanning 913,000 square feet.\nExisting properties have been trading, as well.\nHouston-based Hines earlier this year\nbought a distribution center at 555 Saint James Gate\nin suburban Bolingbrook for $29.5 million, or about $73 per square foot. Seller TradeLane Properties had purchased the 404,000-square-foot facility in 2021 for $24.6 million.",

        "content": "The Quad, a newly redeveloped office and retail campus in Uptown Dallas, secured a $228.2 million refinancing.\nJLL Capital Markets represented Stream Realty Partners in arranging the five\u2011year senior loan, which replaces a prior $181 million construction loan for the site\u2019s redevelopment, the\nDallas Business Journal reported\n. An affiliate of New York\u2011based investment firm KKR provided the financing, with a deed of trust recorded Nov. 11 confirming the deal between KREF Capital, the real estate investment arm of KKR, and owner SRPF B Quadrangle Property, a unit of Stream Realty. The company has major holdings in\nHouston\nand\nAustin\n.\nOpened in May 2024, The Quad spans two office buildings and six standalone retail structures at 2828 Routh Street and 2699 Howell Street in Dallas. Its centerpiece is a 12\u2011story, 345,000\u2011square\u2011foot office tower that was about 80 percent leased as of September.\nTenants include M Financial Group, Revantage, Berkshire Residential, LDWW, Chicago Title and law firm Perkins Coie. The campus also features a renovated 500,000\u2011square\u2011foot legacy office building.\nBeyond office leasing, The Quad has a vibrant retail and dining scene. Michelin\u2011starred Mamani opened in September, joining Australian caf\u00e9 Two Hands, Korean\u2011Japanese restaurant Domodomo K\u014d, and Michelin\u2011recommended Written by the Seasons. Bread Club, an upscale bakery, is slated to open by year-end, while LDU Coffee launched its sixth Dallas site on the campus this summer. These establishments surround an acre of landscaped green space.\nStream Realty, run by CEO Chris Jackson, acquired the former Quadrangle in 2019 with the vision of transforming the aging site into a modern hub. Redevelopment began in 2022, backed by the original $181 million loan.\nThe refinancing signals lender confidence in urban office campuses, despite other challenges in the office market. The Quad has benefited from its position near other\ntrophy Uptown developments\nsuch as the 26\u2011story 23Springs. Although Uptown has emerged as a\ndowntown-like district\nfor Dallas tenants, it has managed to avoid the fate of legacy downtowns with their vacant office towers and dwindling foot traffic post-pandemic.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

The buyers borrowed $34.5 million from U.S. Bank.\nThe price amounts to $288 per square foot.\nJacaranda Plaza consists of three one-story buildings completed in 1974 and 1999 on 16.2 acres, Vizzda records show. It was renovated in 2013.\nAside from Publix, the shopping center also is anchored by Ross Dress for Less. Other tenants include Five Below, Planet Fitness, Dollar Tree and nurse registry Value Care At Home.\nAn entity tied to Epic \u2013\u2013 led by Daniel Holland, Jason Maddox and Nick Tortorice \u2013\u2013 had paid $29.3 million for the plaza in 2016, Vizzda records show. In 2022, Epic and Heitman formed a joint venture through which Epic recapitalized five properties, including Jacaranda Plaza, according to a joint news release issued at the time.\nCore, a retail investment firm focused on Southeast markets, primarily Florida, owns and manages a portfolio of about 2.5 million square feet, its website shows. Led by Adam Greenberg and Michael Lapointe, Core has been a frequent investor in South Florida.\nIn August, Core and Spectrum Business Ventures sold the Aldi-anchored Palmetto Plaza at 15905-16341 Northwest 57th Avenue in Miami Gardens at a discount for\n$22.5 million\n. The buyer assumed the\n$22.5 million\nloan on the property, which Core and Spectrum had purchased for $33.6 million in 2020, records show.\nIn 2022, Core paid\n$44.8 million\nfor the Deerwood Town Center at 11905 Southwest 152nd Street and 12107 Southwest 152nd Street in Miami-Dade County\u2019s West Kendall neighborhood.\nResnick\u2019s investments include the Kendall Marketplace at 11531-11631 Southwest 88th Street in Kendall, which he bought for\n$32 million\nin 2022.\nIn other recent grocery-anchored sales, Boca Raton-based Carlyle Management and an entity managed by Edward Rutkovsky bought Royal Eagle Plaza at 9100-9190 Wiles Road in Coral Springs last month for\n$60.5 million\n.

        "content": "A residential compound in Beverly Hills\u2019 tony\nBeverly Park\nhas reentered the market with a new look as the seller seeks to entice buyers with an 11 percent price cut.\nThe roughly 28,000-square-foot home at 73 Beverly Park Lane headed back on the market last week with an asking price just under $80 million, or $2,807 per square foot. It was Los Angeles County\u2019s priciest listing last week, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe weekly report, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, looks at new listings and signed contracts listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe Beverly Park mansion, located in a gated community where business titans and celebrities reside, sits just a few steps from 71 Beverly Park Lane, which\nParis Hilton\nand husband Carter Reum paid\n$63.1 million\nfor in June.\nThe latest neighborhood listing first went up for sale last May in hopes of nabbing nearly $90 million. It was taken off the market in March.\nThe speculative development is owned by Paradigm Developers\u2019 Todd DeMann, according to property and state records. Paradigm built the property with Harrison Design and Mike Moser Studio.\nThe developer dreamed up nearly every luxury, including a primary suite running about 5,000 square feet, screening room, two kitchens, home office, outdoor kitchen and fruit tree orchard.\nBuyers also have the option of snapping up the adjacent parcel, which has approved plans to build an equally expansive mansion of about 29,000 square feet at 74 Beverly Park Lane. Combined properties would span 4.5 acres.\nCompass\u2019 David Kramer and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton hold the listing.\nElsewhere last week, Eklund Gomes reported 705 Palisades Beach Road in Santa Monica as last week\u2019s top home to go into contract.\nThe nearly 4,000-square-foot residence has four bedrooms and five bathrooms with an asking price just under $16 million, or $3,991 per square foot.\nIt hit the market in late October and is listed by Pardee Properties\u2019 Colette Stevens.\nProperty and state records show the home is owned by a limited liability company, managed by Sherri Conn in Fort Worth, Texas. An individual of the same name and Texas address tracks to the CFO of family office Wildcat Partner Holdings and is also vice president of property management firm Tarrant Management.\nThe Santa Monica residence touts about 60 feet facing the beach, outdoor dining, a pool and elevator.\nIt also comes with a link to Hollywood history, with the home once owned by late actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks. \u201cThe Mark of Zorro\u201d and \u201cRobin Hood\u201d actor established film production company United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith in 1919.\nMarket pulse\nOverall, last week\u2019s signed contract activity in the county showed a rebound from the past few weeks\u2019 doldrums.\nThe Eklund Gomes team reported 19 signed contracts equating to $143.3 million in volume. That\u2019s 10 more contracts and a spike of nearly 170 percent in volume compared to a year ago.\nForty-five homes were either listed or re-listed last week, which brought the market\u2019s total inventory to 1,204 properties, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n.\nDespite the week-to-week swings, a measure of dealmaking in the third quarter showed the County\u2019s high end on the up.\nThird-quarter closings jumped 21 percent year-over-year to 497 trades for L.A. County properties listed in the MLS for $4 million or more, according to data compiled by Westside Estate Agency. Volume in that same period rose 25 percent from the year-ago period to $784.4 million.\n",

Bank of America provided the loan, Hotel Business\nreported\n.\nThe 300-key hotel project, which will be at 3737 Stadium Drive, is estimated to cost $450 million in total. It\u2019s the only permitted hotel in Kroenke\u2019s Hollywood Park mixed-use district surrounding SoFi Stadium, the Kia Forum and the Intuit Dome.\nWhen complete, the Kali Hotel will become a part of Marriott\u2019s luxury Autograph Collection. Construction\nkicked off last year\nand topped out in September; the project is expected to wrap up late next year.\nPlans for the development call for a rooftop dining space, spa and wellness facilities and 20,000 square feet of meeting space.\nThe Kali Hotel will be just one part of the Hollywood Park complex, expected to boast up to 4 million square feet of creative office space, roughly 900,000 square feet of retail space and up to 2,500 multifamily residences. Builder Clayco is handling construction of the hotel while Lamar Johnson Collaborative is acting as architect and Gensler is designing the interior. Kroenke\u2019s Kroenke Holdings is spearheading development in Hollywood Park with Wilson Meany working as development manager, and Clayco also building the forthcoming\nHollywood Park Studios\ndevelopment.\nThe 12-acre studio, poised for construction at the Hollywood Park retail village at 1001 Stadium Drive, would serve as a hub for the International Broadcast Center for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. After that, it would be available for entertainment production and operations. Plans for the project include five 18,000-square-foot soundstages and a three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building for support, production and postproduction facilities.\nThe Kali Hotel, like Hollywood Park Studios, is part of Kroenke\u2019s greater plan to create a contained community with multiple uses for visitors.\n\u201cThe vision for Hollywood Park has always been to build a city within a city combining media, entertainment and technology that will transform the greater Los Angeles area,\u201d the\nLos Angeles Rams\nowner\nsaid\nof the 300-acre development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A newly formed tenants union\u2019s request for leniency from eviction was denied by Cook County Judge Debra Ann Seaton at a hearing on Monday.\nThe case involves residents of the apartment building at 7500 South Shore Drive, the site of a dramatic immigration raid in September. The tenants union requested $7,500 in relocation assistance and 60 additional days to vacate after the current deadline set for this Friday,\nBlock Club Chicago reported\n.\nSeaton denied the motions, siding with plaintiff Wells Fargo in its foreclosure case against property owner Trinity Flood.\nDespite Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s support for the tenants\u2019 requests, Seaton insisted residents had already been offered aid and emphasized the building\u2019s dangerous conditions, citing gas leaks, plumbing failures and reliance on portable heaters.\n\u201cIt would be inhumane for this court not to relocate people as quickly as possible,\u201d the Cook County judge said.\nSam Barth, an attorney representing the union, argued residents wanted to leave but could not secure leases on such short notice, warning that eviction risked homelessness. Seaton responded she was not making anyone homeless and criticized Barth\u2019s language as \u201ctriggering.\u201d Seaton ordered tenants to\nleave the building\nlast month.\nControl of the property had already been transferred to receiver Jared Friedman after Flood failed to address hazards. Friedman testified his company posted eviction notices and offered residents $5,000 in relocation payments \u2014 $2,500 upfront and $2,500 upon departure. Twelve tenants accepted, though organizers said the offers came with pressure to decide quickly.\nSeaton praised Friedman as an \u201cactively engaged receiver,\u201d dismissing union complaints that he avoided meeting with them.\nThe dramatic U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement raid took place in September, filmed by federal agents. It brought attention to conditions inside the building. A foreclosure lawsuit from Wells Fargo\nlaunched prior to the raid\n.\nThe incident raised legal questions\nfor landlords\nand put Neenah, Wisconsin-based Trinity Flood\nin a spotlight\n.\nAbout 30 residents remain members of the union in a building with 130 units. The union has decided to support tenants in accepting Friedman\u2019s offer, while supplementing assistance through its own fund.\nYet residents stressed that the money does little to solve the immediate crisis. Malfunctioning elevators, leases unavailable on short timelines and the sheer difficulty of moving in winter compound the challenge.\n\u201cFinding placement is the issue,\u201d said tenant leader Darren Hightower.\nFellow resident Raymond Corona lamented that despite following rules, he must relocate within days, hauling belongings through snow.\nOrganizers framed the plight as emblematic of the city\u2019s housing crisis, with some suggesting crowdfunding as a last resort.\nFriedman confirmed plans to lock the building Friday, promising scheduled access to retrieve\u00a0 belongings.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

One\nproposal calls for 1,800 apartments\nat the 3.6-acre Safeway site in the Fillmore District; another outlines 366 homes at the Bernal Heights Safeway location, as well as 532 units at the Outer Richmond Safeway. Last week, Safeway and Align filed\nplans for 790 apartments\nat the Safeway site in the Marina District.\nThose aren\u2019t all the Safeways in the city that could be redeveloped into mixed-use properties, according to the Business Times. Safeway, headquartered across the Bay in\nPleasanton\n, also has stores on a 1.2-acre site at 735 7th Avenue in the Inner Richmond; another 1.2-acre site at 2350 Noriega Street in the Outer Sunset; and a 0.8-acre site at 625 Monterey Boulevard in Sunnyside. The company also owns a handful of small parcels making up part of the surface parking lot for its store at 2020 Market Street.\nWhether the grocer, which is part of Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, plans to pursue\nsimilar residential-above-grocery projects\nat those sites remains to be seen.\n\u201cSafeway is constantly evaluating locations to better serve the neighborhoods of which we are part and to provide customers with a convenient, modern shopping experience that meets their needs,\u201d the company told the Business Times regarding the redevelopment of other stores in the future.\nWith 3,488 units already planned, Align has largely reached its goal of putting 3,500 apartments into San Francisco\u2019s housing stock at a time when the city needs it. San Francisco is mandated by the state to build 82,069 new units by 2031 under its\nhousing element\n.

The price amounts to $480 per square foot.\nBank of America issued a $28.4 million note for the transaction, according to records. Match\u2019s ex-parent company, IAC, has its name on the seven-story building.\nOmega Law Group founding partners Edwin Saghian, Robin Saghian and Shahab Mossavar-Rahmani signed the loan document and are members of the limited liability company named as grantee.\nIt could be the partners were representing a client, but because their accident and injury firm is located at the purchased property, according to their website, it is more likely they are the buyers.\nNeither Match nor Omega responded to requests for comment.\nBarry Diller\u2019s IAC spun off its shares of Match more than five years ago, and Match became the owner of 8800 West Sunset Boulevard and 8833 Sunset (which it still owns and was designed by the\nlate\nFrank Gehry) in exchange for shares of common stock equal to $73.2 million and $46.8 million, respectively, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\nBut that was before the pandemic and the subsequent remote takeover that killed a need for a lot of office space. West Hollywood offices have a 18 percent vacancy rate, which is much better than downtown\u2019s 33.3 percent, a poster-child for\ndistress\n\u2014 but worse than\nCentury City\u2019s\n12 percent.\nThe\npriciest\nLos Angeles County office sale all year occurred downtown: Uncommon Developer\u2019s $210 million purchase of the Brookfield-owned 601 South Figueroa Street, a deal only came out to about $200 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "New Yorkers who own real estate \u2014 even a single townhouse \u2014 might be headed over a cliff.\nI\u2019m talking about the estate tax.\nIf a New Yorker with a net worth of up to $7,717,500 dies in 2026, the first $7.35 million is\nnot taxed\nby the state. But if an estate is worth more than 5 percent above that exclusion threshold, the entire estate is taxed.\nTax professionals call that a cliff.\nNew York\u2019s estate tax rate starts at 3.06 percent and rises quickly, topping out at 16 percent for estates worth more than $17.25 million. People worth that much have likely done some estate planning, or at least thought about it.\nIt\u2019s New Yorkers who don\u2019t consider themselves wealthy, but who have had a home and a 401(k) for a while, who tend to be shocked when they realize how the state will tax what they leave behind.\nThe impact of going over the precipice is severe. At the edge of the cliff, a $7,717,500 estate would pay a tax of just $49,980 \u2014 only 0.6 percent. An estate worth $1 more than that is over the cliff and would pay $734,580 \u2014 a hefty 9.5 percent. The difference between those two tax bills is $684,600.\nFrom a policy perspective, how does it make any sense that dying with a single extra dollar would cost your heirs $684,600? Perhaps state lawmakers really want to motivate New Yorkers to reduce their net worth.\n(There is no federal estate tax cliff. Plus, the federal exemption amount is absurdly high. An individual who dies with $14 million pays no federal estate tax.)\nIf you live in an $8 million townhouse with no mortgage, avoiding the cliff will be difficult. You could sell or mortgage the house and give away some of the money, but be warned that non-charitable gifts made within three years of your death will be clawed back into your estate by Albany.\nAnother option is to donate your home to charity with a life estate, meaning you can keep living there until you die, at which point the charity gets it. This immediately removes the home from your estate and also provides an instant income tax deduction that can be carried forward as needed.\nDonating the house also guarantees that your heirs won\u2019t fight over it when you\u2019re gone. But that kind of thing\nnever happens\n, right?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf COPA (Community Opportunity to Purchase Act) passes and nonprofits buy a bunch of apartment buildings, the buildings would no longer have to pay property taxes. Has anyone mentioned the potential impact of the bill on city revenue?\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city does not allow buildings\u2019 lighting \u2014 such as that on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new skyscraper at\n270 Park Avenue\n\u2014 to display advertising or company branding.\nElsewhere\u2026\nTwo landmarked buildings are close enough to Extell Development\u2019s project at 655 Madison Avenue to sell air rights to it: 781 and 790 Fifth Avenue.\nBut only 790 Fifth can do so, says PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry, because 781 Fifth \u2014 the Sherry-Netherland co-op \u2014 is overbuilt. It has been there since 1927.\nBarnett is also getting 129,000 square feet of development rights in return for making improvements to the Fifth Avenue/59th Street subway station. Those improvements will benefit his building and the public at large.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a 2,488-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.2 million\nfor a 13-unit apartment building at 2923 Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Central Harlem.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27 million\nfor a 5,475-square-foot condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nile Lundgren of Serhant has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 64,675-square-foot, 74-unit project at 191 Canal/17 Cedar Street in Stapleton. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Zeldy Roth.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub, Daniel Fromm and Sam Speciale arranged the debt.\nThe 16-story, 170-unit development opened in March, featuring one- to three-bedroom apartments.

There\u2019s also 45,000 square feet of commercial space, divided into eight separate units.\nAmenities include lounges and dining areas, an outdoor deck with pergolas and a barbecue area, a fully furnished roof deck and a fitness center.\nThe mixed-use development replaced the famed Trylon Theatre, a movie house that opened during the 1939 World\u2019s Fair and stayed in place until its demolition three years ago. Design aspects of the development, like its terra cotta features, pay homage to its Art Deco past.\nMore recently, it was home to Ohr Natan Synagogue and the affiliated Center for New Americans, a Bukharian community center involved in a\nlegal dispute\nover rent about a decade ago.

        "content": "NorthPoint Development secured an $82.6 million refinancing backed by a four\u2011property industrial portfolio totaling 1.6 million square feet in South Chicago.\nThe debt, provided by New York Life Insurance, carries a maturity date of 2031,\nCommercial Property Executive reported\n. Kansas City-based NorthPoint originally purchased the properties from Greenfield Partners in 2017, financing the deal with a $69 million acquisition loan later assigned to Nationwide Insurance, which was set to mature last month.\nThe portfolio, completed in 2002 and 2003, spans 88.6 acres and includes four facilities, according to Yardi Matrix. They include: Commerce Park Building 1 at 2924 East 126th Street (384,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 2 at 12525 South Carondolet Avenue (247,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 3 at 12519 South Burley Avenue (460,417 square feet); and Chicago Campus Building 4 at 3400 East 126th Street, the largest at 547,200 square feet.\nThe properties feature clear heights of 28 to 30 feet, dock\u2011high doors, grade\u2011level access, single\u2011load configurations and ESFR sprinkler systems. Together, they provide more than 1,000 small\u2011vehicle parking spaces and more than 150 trailer positions.\nTenants include Flex\u2011N\u2011Gate, Dakkota Integrated Systems, Troy Design and Manufacturing and Ford Motor Company.\nSituated along the Calumet Corridor, the buildings are near Ford\u2019s historic Chicago assembly plant.\nThe loan follows another financing from New York Life. Earlier this year, NorthPoint acquired a 2.8 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nChicagoland portfolio\nin a $270 million deal, supported by a $178 million loan from the insurer, maturing in 2032.\nEven with\noversupply\nand economic slowdown, Chicagoland\u2019s industrial market has proven\u00a0 resilient. Sales volume surpassed $2 billion year\u2011to\u2011date through October, ranking seventh nationally and second in the Midwest behind Detroit, based on Yardi Matrix data. Average sale prices in the metro stood at $90 per square foot, well below the U.S. average of $136, making Chicago the second\u2011lowest nationally after Kansas City. Asking rents have held up\nas well\n.\nNorthPoint Development, founded by CEO Nathaniel Hagedorn in 2012, operates in the Chicago and\nNew York metro\nmarkets.",

The project is part of a city\u2011backed initiative to transform outdated office towers into residential units, with requirements that at least 30 percent of apartments be affordable.\nYet the landmark designation has sparked debate among preservationists, highlighting tensions between redevelopment and architectural heritage. The tower replaced Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler\u2019s Chicago Stock Exchange Building, demolished in 1972 in a move widely criticized and credited with galvanizing Chicago\u2019s preservation movement.\nChicago Sun-Times architecture critic Lee Bey called it \u201can ironic twist\u201d that landmark status is now being considered for what he described as a \u201cnondescript\u201d replacement. Designed by Thomas Stanley, the tower incorporates New Formalism elements such as vertical columns and granite cladding, but many view it as uninspired compared to Sullivan\u2019s ornate original. Chicago Architecture Center CEO Eleanor Gorski argued the case underscores the need for consistent preservation standards.\n\u201cWhen preservation rules appear either arbitrary or inflexible, it invites uncertainty, and uncertainty almost always undermines investment,\u201d she told CoStar News.\nGolub and Corebridge acquired the property through\nforeclosure\nin 2023 and aim to make it one of the first major Loop office\u2011to\u2011apartment conversions. A smaller\nprecedent exists\nat the building at 79 West Monroe Street, where eight floors are being converted into 117 apartments.\nGolub principal Lee Golub acknowledged the tragedy of Sullivan\u2019s building\u2019s demolition, which claimed the life of preservationist Richard Nickel, but emphasized the importance of reviving\nthe office district\n. Plans include new windows, building systems, outdoor amenities and the return of urban farming company Farm Zero.\n\u201cWe need to move forward, and 30 North LaSalle is a vital project in the rejuvenation of the LaSalle Street financial corridor,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

By contrast, Austin\u2019s housing starts fell nearly 15 percent in 2025 to 14,620, representing a steep 40 percent decline from 2022 levels, with accompanying declines in\nhome values\nand\nmortgage activity\n.\nTogether, the San Antonio and Austin metros produced about 32,800 housing starts, making the region the third\u2011largest homebuilding market in the United States, trailing only in-state rivals Dallas\u2011Fort Worth and Houston.\nBryan Glasshagel of Zonda Advisory emphasized the disparity, noting that San Antonio now ranks sixth nationally on its own and remains one of the few major markets\nstill expanding\n.\n\u201cShould Austin continue to pull back, San Antonio is going to be the volume leader in the state,\u201d he said.\nGrowth in the San Antonio market has concentrated outside of the city limits and even beyond Loop 1604, with notable increases in suburban markets such as Converse, Elmendorf, Castroville and Adkins. That puts most of the growth in the\nsouthern\nand eastern suburbs of the city.\nThe strength of the market was further underscored by data from the San Antonio Board of Realtors. Despite an 11 percent decline in October home sales to 2,639 properties, the median price held steady at $305,000, and inventory stood at 6.04 months \u2014 conditions described as balanced by local brokers.\n\u201cWhile sales have slowed, steady pricing and strong inventory levels give both buyers and sellers more flexibility,\u201d Sabor Chairman Ed Zapata noted.\nThe current dynamic marks a reversal from 2022, when Austin significantly out\u2011built San Antonio.",

        "content": "At first glance, architects had a banner year this year.\nThe number of permits filed for many of the city\u2019s top architects doubled or even tripled from last year. The incumbent top architect, Nikolai Katz, had his filings explode to 61 this year from 15 last year.\nBut dig a little deeper, and the numbers show a different phenomenon \u2014 one that appears to be entirely driven by the city\u2019s affordable housing tax abatement, 485-x, which was rolled out in April 2024.\nThe abatement requires projects building over 99 units to pay construction workers the prevailing union wages, resulting in the complete elimination of large projects using the city\u2019s tax abatement program.\nInstead, there have been a series of smaller projects that allow developers to stay under 100 units \u2014 and lead to more permits for architects.\nFor example, Katz has five projects with more than one permit filed for work being done on the same block. Combining the total number of units of each set of permits would yield over 100 units every time.\nThe numbers back up what architects have described for much of the past year.\n\u201cPeople are looking for smaller deals \u2014 clients that used to build 500-unit buildings are now looking at 100-unit buildings or less,\u201d Ben Grunwald, JFA chief operating officer and partner,\ntold The Real Deal in May\n.\nAside from the impact of 485-x, 2025 showed an industry that is getting back to work. In the third quarter of this year, there were\npermits filed for 11,746 multifamily units\n, a 69 percent increase from the prior quarter and the highest total since the first quarter of 2022.\nRead below for more about the most active architects filing those permits. The 2025 ranking is based on the number of initial permit applications filed for new buildings and renovations and reflects the architect of record through Dec. 1 on projects of at least 10,000 square feet. The methodology differs from the one\nTRD\nuses for its\nannual rankings published during the spring\n.\nNikolai Katz | 61 applications | 2.4M sf\nNikolai Katz once again claimed the top spot as the city\u2019s most active architect. His business has continued to benefit from its orientation in the outer boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx, which have accounted for over 78 percent of the more than 5,800 units proposed under 485-x, according to data from the Real Estate Board of New York.\nIn the Bronx alone, Katz is responsible for 36 permits covering 2,352 proposed units, including a set of 99-unit buildings on Mt. Hope Place. Katz\u2019s one permit for a building with more than 99 units is at 30-17 12th Street in Astoria, Queens, where he is working on a nine-story building spanning over 98,000 square feet that will yield 124 units.\nLeandro Nils Dickson Architect | 32 applications | 1.2M sf\nFor the second straight year, Leandro Nils Dickson Architect secured second place on the list of most active architects.\nSimilar to Katz, the architect specializes in midsize projects in the outer boroughs. The largest project filing for the architect is a more-than 70,000 square foot project in the Bronx on Marion Avenue which is expected to yield 45 units. Steven Westreich of Westorchard Management is listed as the owner behind the applications.\nDXA Studio | 18 applications | 440K sf\nDXA Studio has its fingerprints on a number of high-end condo developments across the city, including Avdoo\u2019s 105-unit project called Bergen, but its filings as the architect of record this year are based in the outer stretches of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.\nIts one Manhattan-based filing is for a 54-unit development from Lipa Engel at 47 East 30th Street that will rise 21 stories and span roughly 36,000 square feet.\nNode Architecture | 17 applications | 577K sf\nFounded in 2010 by Jakov Saric and Radomir Delic, Node Architecture did not appear on the list of top architects at all last year when the firm had just five filings for a total proposed square footage of roughly 85,000.\nThis year, Node has a single project spanning more square feet than that, an 11-story mixed-used building in East Harlem spanning over 101,000 square feet. The project will yield 96 residences.\nNode\u2019s other major project is taking place on East 167th Street in the Bronx, and is split across two buildings, one of which will yield 98 residences and the other of which will yield 85 residences. The total combined square footage of the project will be almost 139,000 square feet.\nKao Hwa Lee Architects | 17 applications | 1.2M sf\nDespite not having a website, Kao Hwa Lee Architects has made its presence felt in the city with a number of projects over 50,000 square feet. The firm has also gotten in on the 99-unit boom with over 33 percent of its 17 filings for 99-unit buildings.\nThe largest of those is an 88,000-square-foot project in Williamsburg on North 8th Street which will rise 17 stories. The architect\u2019s smallest project by unit count is a 29-unit mixed-use building at 31 Church Avenue in Brooklyn, which will have commercial, residential and community space.\nJFA Architects &amp; Engineers | 17 applications | 1.3M sf\nJFA may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the industry\u2019s pivot to multiple sub-100-unit projects. The firm submitted six separate applications for buildings under 100 units on 165th Street in Queens in July for a project that will in total deliver 591 units across over 450,000 square feet.\nThe firm also submitted applications for neighboring buildings in Long Island that would yield a combined 166 units spanning over 160,000 square feet.\nGerald Caliendo Architects | 16 applications | 285K sf\nGerald Caliendo Architects has the honor of being the representative with the smallest average project size on the list, with its 16 applications covering an average of just over 24,000 square feet.\nIts largest proposed project spans over 65,000 square feet in Kew Gardens, Queens, and would yield 57 residential units. The firm has also taken on a number of alterations this year.\nS. Wieder Architect | 15 applications | 946K sf\nS. Wieder Architect fell to eighth from third last year, despite filing five more applications this year. Its largest filings are for a pair of 99-unit buildings at 230 and 234 Clarkson Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens for developers Shlomo Karpen and Louis Handler of Keren Star Management. The site had previously been marketed as able to hold a single project of more than 150,000 square feet, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nBadaly Architects | 14 applications | 421K sf\nNima Badaly launched his eponymous firm in 1988, and works alongside his two sons, Shahin and Shakib, who serve as an engineer and architect, respectively.\nBronx-based Badaly Architects, launched by Nima Badaly in 1988, is loyal to its borough. Every one of the firm\u2019s applications is for projects in the Bronx. The largest is a 99-unit project at 2748 Jerome Avenue spanning almost 70,000 square feet.\nGensler | 11 applications | 2.4M sf\nGensler arguably has claim to the most renowned projects on this list, reflected by its millions of proposed square feet across just 11 applications.\nAll but one of the filings are for alterations, which speaks to how Gensler has also managed to corner the office-to-residential segment of the market. Its largest project involves converting roughly 760,000 square feet of office space at 750 Third Avenue into 680 apartments for SL Green Realty.\nGensler is also behind InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 571-unit conversion project at\n30 Broad Street\n, Vanbarton Group\u2019s 440-unit conversion project at\n6 East 43rd Street\nand Metro Loft and David Werner Real Estate Investments\u2019 464-unit conversion project at\n675 Third Avenue\n.",

While the site plan review has been completed, city records show that a formal demolition permit has not yet been issued.\nKarlin, which\nlisted the properties\nfor sale in late 2024, declined to comment, and Shiner\u2019s Saloon management could not be reached by the Business Journal.\nThe site\u2019s redevelopment potential is significant, though Karlin has not disclosed future plans. A portion of the 422 Congress Avenue property lies within a Capitol View Corridor, which imposes height restrictions to preserve views of the Texas Capitol. However, most of the land is outside the corridor, allowing for taller construction with a staggered design.\nCurrently, the Austin City Council has capped downtown tower heights at 350 feet under a\ntemporary measure\npassed in October. Developers can exceed this limit if they participate in the Downtown Density Bonus Program and secure city council approval.\nThe site has long been eyed for redevelopment. Merritt Development Group once proposed a $170 million, 36\u2011story AC by Marriott hotel with 340 rooms and a 5,500\u2011square\u2011foot restaurant, but withdrew from the project in 2024.\nThe properties also carry historical significance. They were part of Nate Paul\u2019s World Class Holdings\nportfolio\nbefore Karlin acquired them. Karlin has since redeveloped other World Class properties, notably transforming the former 3M campus in Northwest Austin into a 1.1 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nlife science campus\n.\nThe demolition marks the latest step in reshaping Austin\u2019s downtown landscape. With a prime location, flexible zoning potential and evolving height regulations, the site could become a major redevelopment project, though its future remains uncertain until Karlin or a new owner reveals concrete plans.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Tech CEO Jody Glidden paid $4.8 million last month for a new home in Biscayne Park, a small town that\u2019s sandwiched between Miami Shores and North Miami.\nGlidden, who is dating \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d cast member Lisa Hochstein, bought the tropical modern home after selling his waterfront Hibiscus Island home\nfor $11.9 million\nlast year. But he\u2019s not planning to live in the house; instead, he said he will rent it out. And he\u2019s looking for more properties in the village that he can purchase and redevelop, he told\nThe Real Deal.\nHis purchase in Biscayne Park marks one of a handful of deals that have set records for the village, as wealthy buyers increasingly seek proximity to private schools like Miami Country Day School, which recently secured approval for a renovation/modernization of the campus, and the Cushman School.\n\u201cBrand-new construction modern houses are breaking barriers in these alternative neighborhoods,\u201d said luxury broker\nDora Puig\n, owner of Luxe Living Realty. Puig compared price growth in Biscayne Park to what happened in neighborhoods like\nMorningside\nand Belle Meade. She called it a testament to the demand for private schools, as parents don\u2019t want to spend hours in traffic.\nGlidden, founder of software companies Introhive and Postilize, picked up a canalfront home that spans nearly 6,000 square feet with six bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms on a half-acre lot. The price amounts to $800 per square foot.\n\u201cAreas like Biscayne Park still offer pretty good value. If you want to make a decent multiple on your property, it\u2019s harder to do now in other parts of [Miami],\u201d Glidden said.\nThe developer, a partnership with Aaron Butler of Avenue Real Estate and Kobi and Nancy Karp, paid $1.4 million for the lot in 2022. Butler, who also brokered the sale, said the proximity to Miami Country Day, the village\u2019s curb appeal and low crime rate attracted him to invest.\n\u201cI would develop [in Biscayne Park] again. We\u2019re looking,\u201d Butler said.\nAt least two other newly built houses have sold in recent months in the same price range as Glidden\u2019s purchase. The house had been sitting on the market, but because Glidden paid cash, the deal served as a catalyst for additional sales, creating a comparable deal that appraisers can use.\nButler said it\u2019s a \u201ctransitional time\u201d for the community.\nPuig recently brokered the $5.3 million sale of the four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom house at 967 Northeast 117th Street. The 4,355-square-foot house was built on a third of an acre. An affiliate of Pintos Residential, led by Rodrigo Pintos and Roberto Lopez, sold the property to an LLC managed by an attorney in late November.\nThe property previously sold for $450,000 in 2021.\nA month earlier, a couple paid $4.6 million for the 4,860-square-foot, six-bedroom and seven-and-a-half-bathroom house at 740 Northeast 120th Street. A developer LLC led by Daniel Jaramillo sold the newly built house, which also sits on a third-acre lot. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Juan Zuluaga represented the seller, and Andrea Tavella with Vella Real Estate brought the buyers.\nThe lot previously sold for $750,000 in 2022.\nMiami Country Day, one of the top private schools in South Florida, recently secured approval to revise its master plan to include more properties that the school owns and to raise the height of some planned buildings to three stories, instead of two, said Francisco Garcia of the Euclid Group. The land-use consulting firm is working on the expansion of Miami Country Day\u2019s upper and middle school campus. The project calls for a new dining center, improved traffic flow and green space.\nThe school also recently opened a $20 million fitness and wellness center.\n\u201cWithout question there is\nexceeding demand for educational facilities\nin Miami-Dade County, particularly in the private school sector,\u201d Garcia said, noting that while new buildings will be constructed, the school\u2019s enrollment capacity will remain the same.\n\u201c[Biscayne Park] really is in a fortunate geographic location,\u201d he added. \u201cTraffic is going to be an issue for us for the indefinite future.\u201d\n",

The property includes two buildings and totals 230,691 square feet of office space. The sale price was not disclosed.\nNewmark\u2019s Chris Murphy, Robert Hill, Gary Carr and Austin Sheahan represented the seller, Denver-based Northwood Investors. It purchased the property in 2010, deed records show.\nThe Offices at Park Lane were constructed in the 1970s, but were recently upgraded with a new conference center, tenant lounge, gaming area and furnished outdoor spaces, Newmark said. It was valued at $29.1 million for property tax purposes, appraisal data shows. The property is currently 66 percent leased and serves as corporate headquarters for Boka Powell, Curtainwall Design Consulting and Condon Tobin, according to the release.\nThe office buildings are part of\nThe Shops at Park Lane\n, a 33.5-acre mixed-use district off U.S. Highway 75 about eight miles north of Downtown Dallas. The district features 540,000 square feet of retail space, including a Whole Foods, and more than 570 multifamily units.\nBorra made news this summer when his firm\npicked up 112 acres\nin Celina. He plans to develop a mixed-use project at the site. He also made a similar purchase to Offices at Park Lane in September, when he bought the 10-story, 242,00-square-foot Corporate Point office tower in Las Colinas. It was built in 1981.\nCommercial deal flow is on the rise across the nation, as institutional capital thaws. In the third quarter of this year, investment sales were up 19 percent, year-over-year, Newmark said.\nSimilarly, the\nDallas-Fort Worth office market\nis slowly rebounding. Total vacancy inched down from 25.3 percent to 25 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter, according to a report from Partners Real Estate. The rate slid slightly from 25.1 percent to 25 percent between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of this year. In addition, average office rents jumped 2.5 percent between the second and third quarters to $32.06 per square foot. Third quarter rents are up 4.8 percent, compared to the same period of last year, Partners said.\n",

The deal is expected to close early next year.\nThat\u2019s about half of the\n$566 million\nprice tag that seller Rockpoint Group paid for the Midtown East office tower in 2019, and adds to the list of deeply discounted office buildings that Werner\u2019s snapped up in recent years.\nThat includes the Hudson Yards-area office building at 440 Ninth Avenue he bought in August for\n$105 million\n(sellers Taconic Investment Partners and Nuveen Real Estate\n$269 million\nin 2018), the building at 205 East 42nd Street he and 601W Companies bought last month for about $300 per square foot and the tower at 675 Third Avenue he and Metro Loft Management bought in April for\n$100 million\n.\nA representative for Werner declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Rockpoint did not immediately respond to a request. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger negotiated the sale.\nBuilt in 1972, the property also known as One Dag stands at 885 Second Avenue near the United Nations Headquarters and has long been home to various consulates and permanent missions.\nThe 870,000-square-foot building is about 72 percent occupied, with Memorial Sloan Kettering, the United Nations and the Republic of Germany counting as its largest tenants.\n\u201cOne Dag is strategically positioned among several iconic Class A office assets boasting an average occupancy of 90 percent in the Midtown East market,\u201d reads a marketing memo from Newmark, which notes the building recently received more than $20 million in capital improvements.\nSimilar buildings in the area get average rents ranging from $80 to $90 per square foot, according to Newmark, which positions One Dag as \u201ca compelling relative discount in Midtown East.\u201d\nBoston-based Rockpoint Group financed its 2019 purchase of the building with a $430 million loan from Wells Fargo and Brookfield.\nThe purchase price then worked out to about $650 per square foot. Werner\u2019s deal pencils to roughly $310 per square foot.\nWerner, known for striking when property prices are low as well as for his quirky dealmaking style and penchant for flipping deals, has been converting some of his discounted office properties into residential apartments, and keeping others as commercial buildings.\nHis current buying spree started in about 2022, and he\u2019s since been\none of the busiest investors\nin Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "Scott Rechler is no stranger to enormous office-to-residential conversion projects in Manhattan. In the Financial District, however, the developer is trying something very different.\nRXR filed plans this week to convert part of 61 Broadway into housing, the New York Business Journal\nreported\n. The plans were submitted to the Department of Buildings on Monday.\nRather than transform the entirety of the 670,000-square-foot office property, RXR plans to redevelop only a single floor of the building. The ninth floor will spread 21 apartments across 20,000 square feet of residential space, along with a bike room and a lounge. CetraRuddy Architecture will design the space.\nThe developer did not return the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nRXR ran into trouble at 61 Broadway a couple of years ago. In December 2022, RXR\nwent into default\non the property when it stopped making payments on the loan, which it took out in 2019. The loan had a two-year initial term and three one-year extensions, reaching maturity default in May 2023.\nMonths later, JLL\nlisted for sale\na $240 million nonperforming loan on the troubled Financial District office building. RXR had agreed to hand the keys back through a deed in lieu of foreclosure if necessary, but never did so.\nAt that time, the office space was only 57 percent occupied. In 2019, flexible workspace provider\nKnotel leased\n60,000 square feet across four floors, but\nfiled for bankruptc\ny two years later.\nThe mini-project is a sharp contrast to another RXR conversion that could prove to be one of the biggest in New York City.\nRXR, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green and Marc Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management are planning to convert the 38-story office building at 5 Times Square\ninto up to 1,250 units of housing\n, mostly studios, of which 25 percent would be affordable.\nThe project is expected to get 467m, a property tax break earmarked for office-to-residential conversions where at least 25 percent of units are designated affordable; it would be eligible for a 90 percent exemption for 35 years if construction begins before June 2026.\nThis summer, Corebridge Institutional Investments\nprovided a $561 million loan\nfor the development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The site, which is vacant and has an agricultural land-use designation, spans 77.1 acres.\nThe master-planned Old Town Floridian would consist of 178 villas, 160 townhomes and 108 single-family homes, according to the filings. Site plans show the homes would surround the pair of existing lakes on the site.\nCDDs are quasi-governmental agencies installed to help pay for the construction and maintenance of roads, water and sewer pipes, sidewalks and other infrastructure at massive developments. Overseen by boards, which at first consist of representatives of the developer, CDDs issue bonds that are repaid by special assessments, initially paid for by the developer and then passed on to homebuyers.\nFlorida City commissioners approved the Old Town Floridian CDD in 2020, and Miami-Dade commissioners greenlit it in 2021, according to the CDD\u2019s February board meeting filing.\nCapital improvements for the district are expected to cost roughly $12 million, including $6.8 million for roads, $2.6 million for sanitary collection, nearly $2 million for water connections and $937,000 for stormwater management, the meeting filing shows. The CDD plans to finance this partly by issuing an $8.6 million bond.\nZamora is led by Rosa Zamora, the filing shows.\nDevelopers have used CDDs in Florida since the early 2000s primarily for sprawling suburban housing projects along the state\u2019s west coast. Lennar and D.R. Horton are among the homebuilders that use CDDs.\nThe financing structure has gained more traction in South Florida in recent years, amid a development boom in the tri-county region with large projects. Miami Worldcenter\u2019s master developers, Art Falcone and Nitin Motwani, in partnership with Los Angeles-based CIM Group, created a CDD for the $6 billion project that spans 10 blocks in downtown Miami. In 2017, the CDD sold\n$74.1 million\nin tax exempt bonds.\nIn 2023, Sunrise commissioners approved a Community Development District for Metropica, a planned 64-acre master-planned project at 1800 Northwest 136th Street in Sunrise with 3,300 residential high-rise units. Through the CDD, developer Joseph Kavana can issue up to\n$65 million\nin bonds for infrastructure improvements and services for a 50-acre portion of the site.\nAlso in Sunrise, the city approved the creation of the\nSolterra Community Development District\n, which would finance infrastructure for developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr\u2019s planned\n900-home\nproject at 7400 Northwest 24th Place.\n",

The property was owned by finance industry veteran and racehorse breeder Jed Cohen and his son Tim; the elder Cohen died in 2022, and the son is now selling the property. The family bought the property from oil giant Texaco in 2000 for $3.9 million when the company was operating wells on the site.\nSince the nearly $4 million purchase a quarter century ago, the Cohen family has invested more than $30 million into the property.\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, we started and built this thing together,\u201d Tim said of purchasing the property with his father. \u201cIt just feels a little different now without him.\u201d\nA buyer would gain access to eight separate residences on the property ranging in size from about 900 square feet to 2,000 square feet. Tim Cohen lives with his family part-time in one white stucco home, and the other structures are used for staff. The property is zoned to allow the creation of another home of up to about 20,000 square feet.\nBesides being Cohen\u2019s residence and a popular\nfilming location\n, Rancho Temescal is a fully operational farm with various commercial portions. That includes about 600 acres of irrigated agricultural land, including lemon and avocado orchards as well as other crops. There are several equestrian facilities on site and an events venue used by the family in the past to host weddings and charity events.\nWhoever buys the property could also end up benefiting financially, as the Cohen family currently collects royalties from an oil drilling operation that still exists on the property. The oil and farm businesses are for sale with the ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Monroe Capital provided a $190 million loan for the purchase. Eastdil Secured advised the seller and arranged the debt.\nThe sale marks another large-scale hospitality trade in a market finding its footing after years of uneven recovery. Tourism has roared back and revenues are healthy, but rising labor costs, high interest rates and climbing property taxes continue to squeeze profits.\nLocated at 300 West 44th Street, the InterContinental opened in 2010 as one of the corridor\u2019s few luxury offerings. The project\nreportedly\ncost $500 million to develop. The property operates under IHG Hotels and Resorts management, but that structure will shift under the new ownership. The hotel is expected to convert to an IHG franchise, with Highgate taking over management, sources said.\nThe deal appears to be the second-largest single hotel deal of 2025, behind Kam Sang Company\u2019s purchase of the\nEdition Clocktower Hotel\nin October for $235 million. The same month, a group of large institutional investors\nbought a portfolio\nof four Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million.\n\u201cAfter a couple of years of New York being in the doldrums,\u00a0 it\u2019s kind of amazing the comeback that the city has endured thus far,\u201d said Daniel Lesser of LW Hospitality Advisors. \u201cThe hotel business is really strong in New York, from a top-line perspective. There\u2019s definitely a challenge with bringing profits down to the bottom line.\u201d\nHighgate, Gencom and Argent Ventures did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

        "content": "The city has tapped Slate Property Group, Xenolith Partners and nonprofit Comunilife to build more than 600 affordable housing units in northern Manhattan.\nThe team submitted the\nwinning bid\nto develop 4095 Ninth Avenue, a long-vacant, city-owned site along the Harlem River in Inwood, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development announced Wednesday.\nThe project, dubbed La Ostra, is expected to include approximately 625 units, of which 224 will be for senior residents. The other 401 will be subject to HPD\u2019s Extremely Low &amp; Low-Income Affordability program, which calls for most units to be affordable to those earning, at most, 80 percent of the area median income. The apartments will be spread across two buildings, with one rising 15 floors and the other 25.\nUnit counts and affordability levels will be finalized when the project secures financing and the property is transferred to the development team.\nThe project will also include a marine science and STEM education center (operated by the Billion Oyster Project and BioBus) and an indoor-outdoor soccer field.\nThe plan is years in the making. The one-acre plot, which has sat vacant for the past seven years, was once home to a City Ice and Fuel warehouse and then served as a parking lot for Spectrum. The city originally only owned the waterfront portion of the site, but reached a deal with Spectrum\u2019s parent Charter Communications at the\nend of 2021\nto acquire the portion of the lot that has street access.\nThe\n2018 Inwood rezoning\nincluded plans to build more than 900 units of housing on city-owned sites, including the Ninth Street property, the Inwood Library and NYCHA\u2019s Dyckman Houses. A new library and 174 units of affordable housing opened in June 2024, but the city still needs to work with NYCHA residents before moving forward with a new building on the public housing site.\nThe Ninth Street project will include green technologies, including solar panels, water turbines, algae panels and a sand battery (which uses sand to\nstore heat\n), according to architect Fernando Villa, of Magnusson Architecture and Planning, which is designing the buildings.\nDavid Schwartz\u2019s Slate recently\nannounced\nthat it is teaming up with Evenhar Development to build a medical office and community facility property at 1578 Lexington Avenue for Mount Sinai. The company has also\nagreed\nto build 450 affordable housing units at a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, as part of Steve Cohen\u2019s casino plan for Citi Field. That proposal is\nawaiting\nfinal approval from the state Gaming Commission.\nThe Ninth Street project was part of the Adams administration\u2019s pledge to advance 24 affordable housing projects in 2024 on city-owned sites. HPD\nreleased\na request for proposals for the site in October of that year. The winning bid\u2019s unit count is slightly higher than the 570 apartments estimated when the RFP was released.\nHPD Acting Commissioner Ahmed Tigani said in a statement that the project underscores that his agency is \u201cfocused on building not just units, but affordable homes and communities.\u201d\n",

The deal for the property at 111 Clarkson Avenue breaks down to $504,000 per unit. The sellers were developers Seth Brown and Richard Ludwig.\nThe Lawrence is a fully rent-regulated property, providing \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d with his biggest challenge since delivering a championship to the Bucks five years ago. The building was developed in 2018 under the\n421a tax abatement program\n.\nAmenities at the two-building complex include a virtual doorman, a landscaped roof deck, a fitness center and two community lounges. No units are available, according to\nStreetEasy\n, and rents have ranged from $2,000 to $4,500.\nThe sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. Antetokounmpo\u2019s agent and investment firm did not return Bisnow\u2019s requests for comment.\nOutside of the world of commercial real estate, Antetokounmpo has been\nthe subject of persistent rumors\nthat he could be leaving the troubled Bucks franchise to become a New York Knick. Reports over the summer suggested he would be interested in a trade to the Knicks and the injured star was recently reported to be mulling his future over with the Bucks\u2019 brass.\nBut the purchase could be little more than a business move for Antetokounmpo. He launched Build Your Legacy Ventures, a venture capital fund, last year, according to the\nSports Business Journal\n. One of the fund\u2019s first investments was to back Unrivaled, a women\u2019s basketball league that puts on games during the WNBA\u2019s offseason.\nAntetokounmpo\u2019s portfolio also includes an apartment building in a suburb of Milwaukee, which he purchased last month for $11.4 million.\nHe isn\u2019t the only baller with multifamily real estate interests in Brooklyn.

        "content": "As the opening of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ngleaming glass-and-steel skyscraper\ndrew near, some Midtown office landlords and brokers were quietly bracing for a shake-up.\nThe 2.5 million-square-foot Foster + Partners-designed tower at 270 Park Avenue is designed to accommodate roughly 10,000 of JPMorgan\u2019s 24,000 New York employees. Across the street is another building the bank owns, paving the way for what some have\ndescribed\nas a JPMorgan-centric neighborhood.\nWhen CEO Jamie Dimon cut the ribbon in October on the bank\u2019s new multibillion-dollar headquarters, it marked the start of a major migration from the company\u2019s other Midtown offices. The financial powerhouse has occupied several prime Manhattan buildings through long-term leases, leaving some to wonder whether they would vacate those properties once the new headquarters was complete.\nBut despite the grand opening, the Manhattan office market is not yet feeling any ripple effects. Rather than shrinking, JPMorgan is doubling down on some leases as it undertakes a $1 billion renovation of 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns building across the street from its new headquarters that it\nbought in 2008\n.\nThe bank just inked a 60,000-square-foot sublease at nearby 390 Madison, boosting its presence there to nearly 500,000 square feet. Elsewhere, it signed a multi-year renewal on its 270,000-square-foot lease at\n237 Park Avenue\n, a win for co-owners RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital. JPMorgan has also extended its 123,000-square-foot lease at Brookfield\u2019s 5 Manhattan West through 2031, retaining a Hudson Yards foothold.\n\u201cWe continue to maintain significant space at our locations across Midtown as we fully renovate 383 Madison over the next several years,\u201d a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said.\nOffice landlords may eventually feel the pain from the JPMorgan reshuffle. Renovations at 383 Madison are expected to finish in 2027, and the expiration of the 390 Madison sublease remains unclear. Landlord L&amp;L declined to comment on the deal, first reported by New York Business Journal.\nMeanwhile, landlords with expiring leases seem to be benefitting from the hot Class A office market. At Stahl Organization\u2019s\n277 Park Avenue\n, where JPMorgan occupies nearly half of the 1.9 million-square-foot building, it renewed 360,000 square feet in late 2024. Two other JP Morgan leases come due in the next few years. A 639,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2026 and a 175,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2028.\nThe landlord is in talks on both with \u201ctop echelon tenants at record-setting rents,\u201d a Stahl Organization spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe have signed leases, leases out, and deals pending for all of Chase\u2019s 2026 expirations. We have lots of inquiries and serious interest for their 2028 expirations,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nNearby, several buildings stand to be renovated to further cement the bank\u2019s \u201ccity within a city.\u201d The firm is weighing options for\n250 Park Avenue\n, an office building purchased last year for over $300 million, which could remain as-is, be redeveloped into a new office tower or converted into a hotel for employees. Plans for another office building at 410 Madison, acquired during the pandemic as a project office for the new headquarters, are also still undecided, according to Bloomberg.\nThe bank isn\u2019t holding on to all of its office properties. JPMorgan Asset Management is\nlooking to sell\na Plaza District office building for $270 million \u2014 roughly half of what it was asking for right before the pandemic hit five years ago.\n",

Because no candidate reached more than 50 percent of the vote, it triggered Tuesday\u2019s runoff.\nThe contest between Higgins and Gonzalez took on a heavily partisan tone, even though Miami local elections are non-partisan.\nGonzalez received endorsements from just about every prominent Floridian Republican politician, including President\nDonald Trump\n, whose primary residence is at his Palm Beach private club Mar-a-Lago.\nMeanwhile, the national and Florida Democratic parties invested heavily in advertising and mailers for Higgins, who also scored endorsements from famous Democrats like former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.\nHiggins\u2019 win makes her Miami\u2019s first female mayor and the first Democrat elected to the position in more than two decades.\nHiggins rakes in real estate donations\nOn the campaign trail,\nHiggins\nand Gonzalez both promised to fix the city\u2019s permitting process, which small business owners and major developers have complained is cumbersome and causes delays for construction timelines.\nBoth candidates also touted plans to tackle housing affordability. Gonzalez backed eliminating property taxes on homesteaded properties, while Higgins promoted her record at Miami-Dade County approving projects with nearly 7,000 affordable and workforce housing units.\nHowever, Higgins scored more support from bigwig real estate players than Gonzalez.\nHiggins racked up nearly 10 times more campaign donations from real estate professionals, corporations and land use attorneys than Gonzalez, according to finance reports for their campaigns after the Nov. 4 elections.\nHiggins also likely nabbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate donations to her political action committee, Ethical Leadership for Miami, which doesn\u2019t have to file its next financial report until January.\nLast month, Miami-based land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes co-hosted a fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami. Other heavy hitters on the invite included Jose Gonzalez, executive vice-president of Florida East Coast Industries, Brightline\u2019s parent company; Nelson Stabile, principal of Integra Investments; Jonathan Raiffe, CEO of Adler Properties; and Sara Adler, principal of Adler Properties.\nAttendees were asked to donate the maximum $1,000 allowed by state law to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign, or \u201cunlimited funds\u201d to Ethical Leadership for Miami. Under state law, no limit exists on how much money PACs can receive from a single donor.\nFinance reports for Higgins\u2019 individual campaign show she received the maximum $1,000 each from 14 developers, real estate corporations and land use attorneys, including Berkowitz Development Group\u2019s Jeff Berkowitz and his wife Yolanda, Swerdlow Group Chief Strategy Officer Michael Liu, Rilea Group and zoning lawyers Iris Escarra and Melissa Tapanes Llahues. In addition, three affiliates of Integra donated a combined $3,000 and six entities with the same address as Adler kicked in a combined $6,000.\nGonzalez received the $1,000 maximum from 11 real estate professionals and organizations, including Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, Associated Builders &amp; Contractors and land use attorney Anthony De Yurre.\nOther commission race runoffs\nThe city of Miami also held a runoff for an open city commission seat that ended with a victory for real estate broker and Brickell restaurant Sexy Fish manager Rolando Escalona. His win ended the Carollo political dynasty in Miami.\nWith 53 percent of the vote, Escalona defeated Frank Carollo, brother of Joe Carollo, who gave up the city commission seat for an unsuccessful run for mayor in this year\u2019s election. Joe Carollo was elected in 2017 when term limits forced Frank Carollo to relinquish the seat after he held it for eight years.\nAmong those who showed up at Escalona\u2019s victory party to congratulate him was Bill Fuller, a Little Havana developer who, along with his business partner Martin Pinilla, won a $63 million judgment against Joe Carollo in 2023.\nIn Miami Beach, former city commission aide\nMonica Matteo-Salinas\nwon an open city commission seat with 71 percent of the vote, defeating lawyer Monique Pardo Pope. The pair were vying for a position vacated by\nKristen Rosen Gonzalez\n, who was narrowly defeated in the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s race by incumbent\nSteven Meiner\n.\nPardo Pope attacked her opponent\u2019s tenure as chairperson of the Miami Beach Community Development Corporation, an affordable housing nonprofit which faced allegations of financial mismanagement and poor living conditions for low income residents in its multifamily buildings, according to the Miami Herald.\nPope faced criticism for\nfailing to reveal to voters\nthat her late father was a Nazi-sympathizing, serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people. After Miami-based filmmaker and local activist Billy Corben disclosed her father\u2019s notorious past and her social media posts idolizing him, Pope released a statement that \u201cI too am a victim in this.\u201d",

        "content": "Another Magnificent Mile office tower is on the brink of default, and set to drag its landlords, Abu Dhabi-based BlueFive Capital and Chicago-based\nGolub &amp; Co.\n, into further financial distress.\nTheir 28-story building at\n625 North Michigan Avenue\nhad its $50.6 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt transferred to special servicing last month due to cash flow issues, with loan servicers noting it\u2019s on track for \u201cimminent default\u201d after the property\u2019s performance plunged far below underwriting, according to Morningstar Credit.\nOccupancy at the 290,000-square-foot office portion of the property fell to just under 64 percent this summer, down from 92 percent when the loan originated in 2019. Its net cash flow is off 43 percent from initial projections, and the debt service coverage ratio \u2014 the amount of building revenue compared to the cost of its debt service \u2014 fell to just 0.41 in the first quarter of this year, far below the 1.35 trigger for lender control, loan servicer notes collated by Morningstar show.\nGolub and BlueFive \u2014 the latter of which gained control of the property after its September absorption of Dubai-based Neo Capital \u2014 now face the risk of foreclosure on the loan, according to Morningstar.\nThe ownership structure has shifted over time. Golub and\nLos Angeles-based CIM Group\npreviously co-owned the building before CIM sold it to Neo for $72 million in 2019. Golub still holds a stake in the property, marking at least its second Mag Mile distress saga this year following an episode at the tower at\n444 North Michigan\n.\nThat 36-story building was seized by\nBlackstone\nearlier this year via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. CIM was also a part-owner in that deal.\nAt the building at 625 North Michigan, the situation deteriorated after SS Research \u2014 formerly the largest tenant, occupying 6 percent of the gross leasable area \u2014 vacated in May. Despite the tower\u2019s average condition with no major maintenance flagged, its revenue has been too weak to keep up with loan obligations, lender commentary shows.\nThe building\u2019s lower four floors \u2014 which house the retail portion \u2014 are owned separately and have had their own issues. In 2024, investor Ben Ashkenazy surrendered that piece of the building to its lender to resolve a $61 million debt, as\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. The deed-in-lieu of foreclosure wiped Ashkenazy\u2019s equity and further fragmented the property\u2019s ownership structure.\nThe problems at the tower at 625 North Michigan add to a growing list of distress cases on the once-vaunted Mag Mile shopping corridor. Nearby, the office tower at 500 North Michigan recently sold for only\n$5.1 million to Greenwich,\u00a0Connecticut-based Commonwealth Development Partners\n, which plans a residential conversion. The fire sale price was a fraction of its pre-pandemic value, which once supported a $94 million loan against the property taken out by its previous ownership.\nJust to the south on the Mag Mile, Louisville, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions is in talks to buy the frazzled office building at\n401 North Michigan Avenue\n. It fell into trouble after its owner, Walton Street Capital, took on a $160 million debt from lender ING, and the property\u2019s value has since dropped, potentially below that figure.\nReal Capital is reportedly eyeing an offer of more than $130 million for the 748,000-square-foot building, but well less than the ING loan balance. The would-be buyer is a backup for Walton after the\nOlayan Group\n, a Saudi Arabian enterprise, expressed interest in the building at 401 North Michigan before backing out of a purchase.\nWhile BlueFive touted its September acquisition of Neo Capital as a strategic foothold in North American real estate, the distressed status of the tower at 625 North Michigan suggests a rough patch within its portfolio. The firm, which announced the integration of $650 million in Neo properties, did not respond to a request for comment. Golub declined to comment, and LNR Partners, the special servicer for the building at 625 North Michigan, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nPresident\nDonald Trump appeared to criticize\nthe state of the Mag Mile real estate market this fall with a cryptic post to social media, though local real estate professionals pushed back against his narrative of bleak prospects. Retail tenants have begun expressing more interest and making moves into storefronts on Michigan Avenue over the past two years, bringing vacancy down from post-pandemic peaks.\nBut the office market remains a challenge in Chicago and across the U.S., as remote and hybrid work, along with elevated interest rates compared to pre-pandemic keep flummoxing landlords who face upcoming loan maturities.\nWhether the tower at 625 North Michigan becomes the next to trade at a deep discount \u2014 or heads into foreclosure \u2014 now rests with special servicers and an ownership group struggling to stop the bleeding.\n",

The six-building Tech Corners office complex in Sunnyvale is reportedly a top choice for the car manufacturer, which welcomed Walmart\u2019s e-commerce division as a tenant earlier this year.\nCurrently, GM has Bay Area offices in cities like San Francisco,\nMountain View\nand Palo Alto. With an approximately 400,000-square-foot wishlist, GM could move several thousand existing workers into its future singular office. The automaker has purportedly struggled to find subtenants for portions of its San Francisco offices.\nGM will have to act fast, as the office market in Silicon Valley has gotten tighter as more AI companies set up shop and workers migrate to the region for jobs. Office vacancy has fallen for four consecutive quarters while demand for high-quality office space has picked up. At the same time, no new buildings are under construction.\nSunnyvale\nin particular has become a hotspot for tech operations as AI, software and hardware companies snap up office and research and development spaces in the city, such as\nDatabricks\u2019 305,000-square-foot lease\nin downtown Sunnyvale in July. In Silicon Valley at large, AI companies now occupy more than 6 million square feet, per\nCBRE\ndata\ncited\nby the Business Times. GM has seemingly been looking to beef up its AI and advanced software work beyond its AI research team in Mountain View, recently hiring AI leaders from giants like Alphabet,\nMeta\nand Amazon.\nGM could sign a lease for a new space in the next two months, the Business Times reported. Several of its office leases expire between 2026 and 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Affordable housing\ndevelopers no longer have to worry about\nMayor Karen Bass\n\u2019 temporary Executive Directive 1 expiring.\nOn Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to adopt the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance, permanently incorporating ED1\u2019s benefits into the L.A. Municipal Code, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Bass issued the directive in her first week in office in 2022, with the temporary order implemented immediately as part of an effort to speed up affordable housing construction projects.\nThe ordinance fast-tracks approval for projects comprising 100 percent affordable housing, requiring approval within 60 days, significantly shorter than the typical six to nine months for most multifamily projects.\nIn order to get the paperwork processed quickly, the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance removes many discretionary review processes that often slow down the approval process for developments, including City Council hearings, environmental reports and neighborhood outreach meetings. Developers must adhere to zoning laws and design review standards in order to qualify for streamlined approval.\nED1 brought in hundreds\nof applications to build affordable housing in the years since its implementation. As of last month, 490 projects have been streamlined under the directive, representing more than 40,000 affordable housing units, per Planning Department data cited by the Times. Of those 490 developments, 437 have been approved. Applications made their way through the approval process in 22 days on average.\nStill, the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance could see some changes in the coming months. ED1 saw various carveouts to prevent overreach in many neighborhoods, including Bass\u2019 2023 exemption of single-family zones, which make up 72 percent of city land. Last year, she exempted historic districts such as parts of Highland Park and Lincoln Heights, as well as \u201cvery high fire hazard severity zones\u201d including portions of Silver Lake and the Hollywood Hills. Bass also sought to avoid displacing renters by sparing projects that would replace rent-controlled apartment buildings with 12 units or more.\nIn a Dec. 2 City Council meeting,\nCouncil member Ysabel Jurado\nsaid that the exemption to preserve rent-controlled buildings should be changed to five units from 12 to avoid displacing tenants in neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights. Jurado argued that the current ordinance exempts 19 percent of rent-controlled buildings, but if the minimum threshold were set at five units, it would exempt 36 percent.\nLos Angeles must plan to build 456,643 units of housing by 2029\nunder\nits state-mandated housing goals, with 184,721 units set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Social:\nA judge tossed the lawsuit filed by residents of the Pierre Hotel against the board.\nThe lawsuit over the future of the Pierre Hotel is no more, but neither side is willing to admit defeat.\nA judge dismissed the lawsuit brought by residents of the building last month, Page Six\nreported\n. The New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the lawsuit was no longer relevant because one of the biggest claims \u2014 a lack of transparency from the building\u2019s board \u2014 had been alleviated.\nThe board has turned over a non-binding term sheet to the tenants, along with three years of the board\u2019s minutes.\nThe board is claiming victory since the lawsuit was dismissed. But the residents are claiming victory too, arguing the case wasn\u2019t dismissed on merit and that the result was a win \u201cfor transparency, for the shareholders, and for the Pierre.\u201d\nFashion designer Tory Burch and fellow residents\nfiled suit\nto halt what they claimed was a secretive and coercive $2 billion sale of the Fifth Avenue property that could result in their eviction.\nThe complaint accused the co-op board of striking an agreement in September with an unidentified LLC allegedly tied to the Khashoggi family, which would fold the building into the Brunei-owned Dorchester Collection.\nThe residents claimed the board refused to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity, financing capacity or exclusivity terms, and that it rejected a rival offer from longtime operator Taj Hotels that would allow the residents to stay.\nWhile the $2 billion sale is still on the table, the board is also considering \u201ca potential sale of the Corporation\u2019s hotel to Taj\u201d and \u201can amendment to the Taj lease agreement that would provide, among other things, a capital investment by Taj in The Pierre.\u201d\nThe Pierre, which just celebrated its 95th anniversary, is struggling to adapt to modern times. Maintenance and service are deteriorating, resulting in fraying carpets and spotty staffing.\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the then-Cantor Fitzgerald CEO who owns the co-op\u2019s penthouse, allegedly helped steer the board toward hiring Newmark Group, the brokerage he ran, to advise on improving the property before pivoting to a sale.\nLutnick, who has never lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, previously distanced himself from the controversy. A spokesperson for his government department said he hadn\u2019t been involved in discussions and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away from his businesses when Trump tapped him for his Commerce Secretary post.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Kolter Group and Perko Development Partners closed on the majority of condos at a\nTequesta\nbuilding where they plan to develop a taller project.\nDelray Beach-based Kolter and\nJupiter\n-based Perko acquired 11 of 12 units at Beach Sound, at 19930 Beach Sound Road, according to property records and information from the real estate database Vizzda. The developers paid $25 million for the units, or about $2.3 million per condo.\nOne remaining unit, owned by Edward and Karen Rado, is tied up in litigation. The Rados sued the condo association and the developers a year ago over the proposed buyout and termination of the association. The total expected purchase, including the Rados\u2019 unit, is $27.3 million, according to Vizzda.\nThe four-story building went up on a 1.5-acre property in 1984. The developers plan to knock the building down and construct an eight-story, 12-unit condo project.\nThe plan also drew a legal challenge from neighbors.\nEarlier this year, the adjacent Claridge Jupiter Island Condominium Association\nfiled a petition\nfor writ of certiorari against the developers and Palm Beach County over the proposed project. The suit, filed Aug. 22,\u00a0 alleges the county improperly approved a waiver requested for the project, and seeks to nullify\nthe decision\n.\nNeighbors who oppose Kolter and Perko\u2019s project refer to it as \u201cthe Beast of Beach Sound\u201d and claim it would \u201ccast shadows on the Claridge pool, spa, fountains, sunbathing areas,\u201d and lists the Claridge, Carlyle, Ocean Sound, Passages, Landfall and Sea Watch as opposed to the development.\nPerko\n, led by Phil Perko, and\nKolter\n, led by CEO Robert Julien, are working on another planned condo project. This summer, the partners\npaid $37.6 million\nto complete a condo buyout in West Palm Beach, where they\u2019re planning Flagler House, a waterfront 18-story, 39-unit condo tower.\nCondo buyouts can often take years, and they are\nnotoriously tricky\nto complete. But in the wake of the deadly Surfside condo collapse and condo safety legislation requiring significant investment in aging buildings, some condo associations have opted to hire brokers to market their buildings for sale to a developer or bulk buyer.\n",

        "content": "A mid-century modern-designed waterfront home at 303 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth changed hands on Wednesday for just under $6.4 million, marking the latest high-dollar sale \u2014 and another potential demolition \u2014 in the North Shore\u2019s robust luxury market.\nThe deal is notable not only for its price tag but for the buyers\u2019 intent: it is being eyed as a potential teardown, which would pave the way for a new, custom-designed mansion on the prime lakefront lot.\nWhile some local fans of the architecture may wish to preserve the\n1959-built home\n, designed by noted mid-century architectural firm Keck &amp; Keck, the buyer\u2019s agent, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, said concerns exist about its structural integrity.\n\u201cWhat makes this house still so valuable is its location is premier,\u201d Radnay said, noting that the nearby\nPlaza del Lago\nshopping center in Wilmette has been improved and added luxury retail tenants like\nHerm\u00e8s\nsince it was purchased by WS Development for $59 million in 2022.\n\u201cThis property has a beautiful street curb appeal. You can see right to the lake, from Sheridan to the shore,\u201d Radnay said, declining to identify the buyer. Public records of the sale aren\u2019t yet available in Cook County databases.\nCarol Hunt of Baird &amp; Warner represented the estate of Nydia Hohf, the home\u2019s former owner who died in September at 105 after living in Kenilworth for 67 years. Hohf and her late husband, Robert Hohf, commissioned the construction of the home. Nydia Hohf was also a daughter of the Wieboldt family, which ran an eponymous Chicago-area department store, Wieboldt\u2019s, for over a century until closing in 1987.\nHunt said the house received huge interest for its unique architecture. She worked with the Kenilworth Historical Society to organize an open house, which drew 200 people to tour the home in two hours.\n\u201cIn the mid-century modern community, people really wanted to see it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique property.\u201d\nHunt said people were interested in preserving the property, but she noted the condition is in bad shape and it wasn\u2019t clear how the house could be saved.\nRadnay\u2019s buyers came out on top after the offering drew multiple bids. The property was listed for $7 million in October.\nThe sale underscores the prevailing trend in the area, where buyers are prioritizing land value and location over existing structures. Another example is down the street, where a\n$6.8 million sale at 501 Sheridan Road\nis also a planned teardown, slated to be replaced by two new luxury homes by developers Leo and Milena Birov. The bigger property, which is on the lakefront, is a planned 17,000-square-foot mansion listed for $16.75 million. Next to it, on a lot facing Sheridan Road with no lakefront access, the Birovs are advertising a nearly $6 million, 11,000-square-foot mansion.\nThis year\u2019s\n$14.5 million record sale\nfor Kenilworth, at 219 Sheridan Road, further illustrates intense demand for North Shore lakefront property. To the north in Winnetka, Radnay also represented the buyers and sellers in last month\u2019s\n$33 million sale of a Sheridan Road mansion\nthat set the record for the priciest Illinois home resale in history.\nWith the luxury market continuing its high-dollar streak, developers and wealthy buyers are often willing to pay a premium to execute their vision for a new estate on irreplaceable land. The potential demolition of the 303 Sheridan home reflects the financial calculation that often prevails in the heated lakefront market. Adding the latest sale, six Kenilworth houses have brought in sale prices of more than $5 million this year, including two off the lakefront.\nA gutted and rehabbed historic home on\nKenilworth Avenue\nbrought in a likely record sale for a non-lakefront in Kenilworth when it sold for $6.1 million in October. The 129-year-old home retained its neoclassical facade, but the inside had been transformed in 2022 with an open floor plan and modern finishes.\n",

        "content": "A federal judge ruled that Cook County\u2019s system for handling unpaid property taxes violates the Constitution, delivering a major victory for homeowners who lost their properties and accumulated equity through tax sales.\nJudge Matthew Kennelly found that the process infringes on the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against unfair \u201ctakings\u201d and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on excessive fines, according to reports from the\nChicago Tribune\nand the\nChicago Sun Times\n. The ruling stems from the class action lawsuit Bell v. Pappas,\nfiled in 2022\n, which challenges how the county manages delinquent taxes.\n\u201cCook County arguably had every piece of information needed to know that its failure to compensate property owners created a high risk of constitutional violations,\u201d Kennelly said in his decision, noting the system was an \u201cobvious\u201d violation.\nUnder current law, property tax debt can be sold after 13 months of nonpayment. If the debt is not repaid within 30 months, tax buyers can claim ownership of the property and keep any profits beyond the debt owed. For example, a homeowner with $10,000 in tax debt on a $100,000 property could lose the entire home, forfeiting $90,000 in equity, while the tax buyer gains a windfall.\nThe lead plaintiff, Michael Bell, inherited a $115,000 home in 2017, but lost it after failing to pay $11,000 in taxes. Bell sought compensation for the lost equity rather than reclaiming the property. Other plaintiffs included another homeowner and community groups such as the Southwest Organizing Project and Palenque LSNA, which Kennelly ruled had standing. Since filing, the lawsuit has grown into a\nclass action\nwith roughly 2,500 homeowners, with estimated claims averaging $60,000 each.\nThe ruling does not determine how plaintiffs should be compensated or whether Cook County and Treasurer Maria Pappas are liable. Pappas and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle declined to comment due to ongoing litigation.\nIllinois remains the only state not to reform its tax sale system following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision\nin Tyler v. Hennepin County, which struck down a similar system in Minnesota.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorney John Bouman emphasized that legislative reform is inevitable, noting that the Illinois General Assembly must act to align state law with constitutional standards. Pappas\u2019 office has advocated for changes, including auction mechanisms to ensure homeowners receive surplus value, but it hasn\u2019t emerged as a\npriority for state lawmakers\n.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

Projects in\nFort Worth\nand elsewhere in the state have negotiated similar deals.\nThe agreement requires San Antonio-based Ridgemont to invest at least $9 million in planning and construction, and stipulates that one restaurant must be operational by the end of 2027.\nThe site, formerly occupied by Nix Health until 2020, has remained empty for years. Rather than pursue another medical tenant, Ridgemont plans a mixed-use redevelopment.\nRidgemont Vice President Trebes Sasser Jr. outlined a strategy to activate the ground floor with food and beverage tenants, while converting the second floor into smaller office spaces. Another empty Nix site in Houston may convert to\napartments\n.\nThe company is targeting late 2026 for initial move-ins, with Studio8 Architects leading the design of the project.\nSasser emphasized that the Broadway corridor has suffered from limited commercial investment in recent years. He hopes the project will spur broader redevelopment, encouraging other property owners to pursue similar investments.\n\u201cThis project will serve as a catalyst for not just this asset, but also casts a vision for other property owners along the corridor,\u201d he told the Business Journal.\nRidgemont, run by CEO Trebes Sasser Sr., has other properties along\nHouston Street\nin San Antonio purchased last year. Ridgemont\u2019s website describes the company as a family investment firm focused on infill sites in San Antonio submarkets.

        "content": "A small\nMarin County\npost office is at the center of a back-and-forth over housing, but a new development proposal looks to keep the building in the same place.\nPaul Thompson, founder and president of Novato-based\nThompson Builders\n, bought the 34,720-square-foot lot at 15 Calle Del Mar in Stinson Beach for an undisclosed price and filed a preliminary application to build six residences at the site, the Marin Independent Journal\nreported\n.\nThe property is currently home to a 9,000-square-foot parking lot and a 3,392-square-foot commercial building, which houses the Stinson Beach post office, a catering company and a cleaning company. Thompson is looking to demolish the building and replace it with a mixed-use residential and commercial building on one corner of the property and four two-story detached condominiums in another. The post office would move to a new 1,250-square-foot space on the ground floor of the mixed-use building.\nThe four proposed condos would be sold at market-rate prices and range in size from about 1,700 square feet to 2,200 square feet with two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Another two residences would each span about 775 square feet on the second floor of the commercial building for a total of six units on site.\nMarin County might be known as a\nNIMBY stronghold\n, but officials are \u201chappy to see an increase to the housing supply\u201d at the site, Sarah Jones, director of the Marin County Community Development Agency, said.\nThompson\u2019s team is preparing to lean on California\u2019s density bonus law, not in order to build more units than zoning would allow, but to secure setback waivers tied to the surrounding wetlands and Eskoot Creek. Because the parcel sits in a coastal zone, the development would need a coastal permit and sign-off that it complies with Marin\u2019s local coastal program. That includes meeting creek and riparian setbacks that can exceed 100 feet. Septic will be another hurdle, as\nStinson Beach\nisn\u2019t under county authority for wastewater, and its water district requires a 100-foot buffer from waterways unless a variance is granted.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A lender is aiming to deliver a knockout blow against boxing promoter Don King over a distressed 52-acre redevelopment site in Palm Beach County.\nA foreclosure auction for the former jai alai fronton at 1415 45th Street in Mangonia Park is set for May 18 after Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Scott Kerner last month awarded a $42.5 million judgment in favor of an affiliate of\nTaylor Made Lending\n, a Pompano Beach-based hard money lender, court records show.\nKing\nand Taylor Made Lending\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nTwo entities managed by King that own the property listed the site for sale in April without an asking price, but sources said the boxing legend was seeking offers in the\n$100 million\nrange.\nThe same month, Taylor Made Lending sued the entities for allegedly defaulting on three loans totaling\n$38 million\nthat were obtained between 2023 and last year. Taylor Made is the special servicer, representing a consortium of investors that own the mortgages, including Miami-based Winston Capital Management.\nThe lawsuit alleges King is a personal guarantor of the loans, but he is not named as a defendant in the complaint. King has a pending motion to dismiss the foreclosure case.\nThe property includes a shuttered 282,800-square-foot jai alai fronton built in 1973, and a lot that is used for parking for a neighboring Tri-Rail passenger rail station, according to an online offering memorandum. King, who\norganized\nsome of boxing\u2019s greatest all-time matches, bought the site for $6.3 million in 1999, records show.\nKing took out the first loan for $22.3 million at a 13.9 percent annual interest rate in 2023, court records show. A year later, he took out the second loan for $9 million at an 18.5 percent annual interest rate, and the third loan for $800,000 with a 2 percent annual interest rate, according to the two mortgages, which were attached to the foreclosure complaint.\nTaylor Made alleges King stopped making the monthly $138,750 interest-only payments on the $9 million loan in September and failed to repay the $800,000 loan when it matured in December.\nKing last attempted to sell the Mangonia Park site a decade ago, but a deal with West Palm Beach-based FRI Investors fell apart.\nThe property is approved for primarily office, governmental, medical outpatient, educational and manufacturing uses, but 25 percent of the site could be developed into some retail such as pharmacies, gift shops, restaurants and gyms, the offering states.\u00a0In July, King sold another distressed property facing foreclosure. An affiliate of Straticon, a Boca Raton-based construction firm, paid\n$11 million\nfor King\u2019s warehouse in Deerfield Beach that served as the boxing promoter\u2019s headquarters. Proceeds from the sale satisfied an allegedly delinquent $5.1 million mortgage King took out on the property in 2023.",

Of that, $5 million would be pulled from special taxes paid by homeowners in the area. The columbarium proposal arose after veterans failed to get their wish for a service member cemetery in Irvine and took their plans to Anaheim for state backing.\nCity officials are looking to build a transit-oriented development that would link the Great Park and Irvine Spectrum neighborhoods at the Crescent site.\n\u201cThe area is particularly well-suited for higher-density residential and mixed-use formats, sidewalk-activated retail and creative commercial spaces, walkable urban blocks and a lifestyle environment attractive to young professionals and knowledge-sector employees,\u201d according to a city staff report cited by LAist.\nThe City of Irvine is required by the state to plan for 23,610 new residential units by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n. Affordable housing must make up 14,939 of those units.\nGreat Park Neighborhoods spans 2,100 acres and opened its first community in 2013. Since then, it\u2019s become one of the country\u2019s top-selling master-planned projects, with builders reporting more than 7,000 home sales, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. FivePoint has already\nsold more than 9,000 lots\nin Great Park, averaging about $790,000 each.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Z&amp;L previously secured approval from the city of San Jose to\nbuild a 708-unit residential high-rise\n. Prior to the\nforeclosure seizure\n, Z&amp;L sought to stave off losing the property through various legal proceedings, including a bankruptcy filing.\nThe $23 million financing package is below what would typically be required to pay for construction of a major residential development such as the one plotted by Z&amp;L. Still, Xu, who signed the mortgage, is seemingly well-positioned to bring in more financing from other insurance companies, judging by the size of the financing deal, according to the Mercury News. Plans for the site are unclear.\nThe United Construction &amp; Development Group founder has developed several large projects in the New York City area, including\nSkyline Tower\n, the second-tallest skyscraper in Queens, as well as other residential towers in the city.\nThe site\u2019s new owners indicated in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing during proceedings with Z&amp;L that they were prepared to build a large residential project on the bus station site.\n\u201cThe vacant land at issue is a rotting, empty former Greyhound station,\u201d the owner group said. \u201cIf allowed to proceed [with a foreclosure], [we have] the resources to develop this piece of property as originally entitled.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project, referred to as Sharka Data Center \u2013 Building 5, will include the core, shell, interior finishes and site improvements.\nConstruction is scheduled to begin in January and be completed by February 2027, though details remain preliminary.\nMidlothian Mayor Justin Coffman cited Google\u2019s local contributions to water conservation, job creation and economic growth. The Mountain View, California-based company first established a presence in Midlothian in 2019 through its Alamo Mission shell company, purchasing 375 acres in Ellis County, and later acquiring another 165 acres for future development, according to data center research firm Baxtel. In 2023, the company announced plans for another data center in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metro market on 165 acres in nearby Red Oak.\nThe region south of Dallas has\ngained interest\nfrom data center builders because two major power lines run through it.\nCompass Datacenters\nand\nDataBank\nhave both invested in the market, and entrepreneur Ross Perot Jr.\nhas opined\nthat Texas is a good fit for data centers because they consume enormous amounts of energy.\nThe Midlothian expansion is part of Google\u2019s larger strategy in Texas. The company has pledged $40 billion in investments statewide through 2027, including projects in Midlothian, Red Oak and three additional data centers planned for West Texas and the Panhandle.\nThe surge in data center development reflects rising demand driven by artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Cushman &amp; Wakefield reported that in 2025, data centers and related industries accounted for 21 percent of new demand in warehouse and distribution properties in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. CBRE projects that Dallas\u2011Fort Worth\u2019s data center inventory will more than double by the end of 2026, with at least 605 megawatts of projects under construction.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Fort Worth-based Panther FW Investments was PHP\u2019s partner in the purchase. The sale price was not disclosed.\nGateway Business Center, at 6005 Commerce Drive, 6015 Commerce Drive, 6000 Campus Circle Drive and 6012 Campus Circle Drive, was constructed in 1981.

It focuses on acquisitions between $3 million and $30 million in Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, El Paso, Houston and Austin. In addition to Gateway Business Center and Gateway South, PHP also bought a 30,000-square-foot industrial property in San Antonio, and the 50,000-square-foot Marine Creek Business Park at 3521 NW Loop 820 in\nNorthwest Fort Worth\n. All four purchases closed this year.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s\nindustrial market\nremains strong, even though its vacancy rate ticked up in the third quarter. The region logged its 60th consecutive quarter of positive industrial space absorption, according to a recent report from CBRE.\nLess than 3 percent of third-quarter completions were pre-leased, which caused the vacancy rate to rise 20 basis points in the third quarter to 9 percent, CBRE found. But that figure is expected to drop again in the near future, since the percentage of pre-leased\nbuildings in the pipeline\nincreased from 18.4 percent to 40 percent by the end of the third quarter.\nManufacturing drove most of the quarter\u2019s leasing demand, according to CBRE. The most in-demand industrial submarkets in the region are South Dallas and Northwest Fort Worth, which is home to AllianceTexas, Hillwood\u2019s 27,000-acre mixed-use development and logistics hub.\n",

The addresses of those sales \u2014 Vlad Doronin\u2019s 730 Fifth Avenue and Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower \u2014 still landed among the priciest trades, even though no deals there, or anywhere else, cracked the nine-figure mark in 2025.\nTogether, the city\u2019s leading deals totaled $540 million, down significantly from more than $720 million last year.\nDespite the lower total, New York\u2019s luxury market hardly felt sluggish, as both deals and prices\nrose in the first quarter\n. Despite fears over the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies began early in the year, the city\u2019s wealthiest buyers still kept the deals coming and were even undeterred by the November mayoral election, which some had warned could send rich New Yorkers in search of greener pastures.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the deals that powered the city\u2019s luxury market in 2025:\n220 Central Park South | $83 million\nMedia magnate Byron Allen sold his 45th-floor condo at 220 Central Park South for\n$82.5 million\n, securing its No. 1 slot on the list in just the third month of the year. Allen, founder of Allen Media Group, bought the 6,000-square-foot condo for $75 million just two years earlier.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern represented Allen in the off-market deal. A previous listing for the apartment described it as having five bedrooms, six bathrooms and two balconies.\n730 Fifth Avenue | $66 million\nThe second most expensive deal to close last year was the final condo at Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York. Unit 25A traded for\n$66 million\nin January to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an LLC.\nThe final apartment at OKO Group\u2019s hotel-condo conversion spans 5,800 square feet and has four bedrooms and a terrace.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin represented the buyer, while the developer\u2019s in-house team led sales, which launched in 2018.\n150 Charles Street | $60 million\nComing in at No. 3 is the new record holder for the priciest condo deal ever in Downtown Manhattan. Financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold their apartment at 150 Charles in March for a whopping\n$60 million\n\u2014 double what they paid for it in 2016.\nThe duplex, which sold to an anonymous buyer in an off-market deal, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\nCompass\u2019 Jim St. Andr\u00e9 and Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, whose new development dealmaking was featured on the new season of \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d represented the sellers. Compass\u2019 Eric Brown and Zeve Salman brought the buyer.\n960 Fifth Avenue | $54 million\nIn a list typically dominated by condos and townhouse sales, an apartment at one of Manhattan\u2019s esteemed co-ops managed to land in the top five priciest sales.\nThe 12th-floor unit at 960 Fifth Avenue sold in January for\n$53.5 million\n, a far cry from its 2023 listing price of $70 million. The co-op was sold by the estate of the late oil heiress Anne Hendricks Bass, who died in 2020, to a buyer whose identity is shielded by a trust.\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert had the listing.\n217 West 57th Street | $47 million\nUnit 121 at Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower sold last month for\n$47.5 million\n, down from its last asking price of just under $55 million. The buyer\u2019s identity was hidden by an LLC known as The Locker Room 121.\nThe full-floor condo, which spans 7,000 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, traded in an all-cash deal.\nAn in-house team with Extell Development is heading sales at the BIllionaires\u2019 Row tower alongside a team with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo. Compass\u2019 Maurice Mizrahi brought the buyer.\n111 West 57th Street | $47 million\nThis year marked a turnaround for 111 West 57th Street, which was struggling to find buyers before JDS Development and Property Markets Group swapped sales teams. With Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team at the helm, the developers offloaded penthouse No. 72 in April for just under $47 million.\nThe triplex condo traded for significantly less than the initial $66 million price listed in the developers\u2019 offering plan and came in under its\nlast ask of $56 million\n. But a deal is a deal, and the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower is now almost across the finish line with 95 percent of its units sold.\n50 West 66th Street | $47 million\nThe 47th-floor apartment at Extell Development\u2019s Lincoln Square project closed for $46.8 million in October, earning it the title of the most expensive sale on the Upper West Side this year. An anonymous buyer purchased the 6,900-square-foot condo, which features a terrace overlooking Central Park.\nThe developer\u2019s in-house team is heading sales at the 70-story tall project.\n973 Fifth Avenue | $46 million\nGoldman Sachs partner David Leuschen finally traded his Gilded Age mansion on the Upper East Side, though the final sale price was nowhere close to what he once sought for it in 2021.\nAn entity tied to the financier bought the 11-bedroom home at 973 Fifth Avenue in 2012 for $42 million. He listed the property almost a decade later for $80 million, though he didn\u2019t find a buyer until May, when he sold it for\n$46 million\nafter dropping the price under $50 million.\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang, Andres Perea-Garzon and Lesley Schulhof had the listing. Modlin brought the buyer.\n217 West 57th Street | $46 million\nCentral Park Tower continued to log discount after discount in 2025, but this deal still managed to land among the year\u2019s 10 most expensive trades. The supertall\u2019s 116th floor sold for just under\n$46 million\n, down $7 million from its last asking price and $20 million from the price specified in the developer\u2019s offering plan.\nThe condo spans 7,100 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Extell Development\u2019s in-house team and a team with Corcoran Sunshine head sales at the building.\n740 Park Avenue | $45 million\nAnother co-op topped the priciest deals list this year, this one a sprawling Park Avenue pad sold by the late wife of billionaire David Koch, Julia Koch. Billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin bought the 8,500-square-foot apartment in February for\n$45 million\n.\nKoch and her late husband bought the 18-room apartment in 2004 for $17 million. She started attempting to offload the unit, which was recently renovated, in 2022.\nCorcoran\u2019s Leighton Candler had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan rents are higher than ever as the year comes to a close.\nMedian rent in Manhattan reached $4,750 last month, according to the monthly report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel, which is based on new, brokered, market-rate leases. The boost spelled a 13 percent increase in prices year over year and the highest Manhattan rent ever recorded by the report.\nThe numbers bookend a banner year for Manhattan rents, which hit new all-time records five times in 2025. A combination of elevated mortgage rates, affluent new residents and tight supply has bolstered rents in the city\u2019s wealthiest borough, according to Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201cIt has all the makings of a tight market,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of deals to be had.\u201d\nManhattan median rents set their first record of the year in February, when they reached $4,500, and then kept climbing. Even though rents usually decline as both the temperature and demand cools, November came in $50 higher than the previous record, set in July ($4,700).\nThe higher end of the market has seen prices grow even faster than the borough-wide average. The median rent for the top 10 percent of apartments has grown more than 17 percent year over year, compared to the 13 percent city-wide growth rate.\nThat mirrors trends in the Manhattan sales market, Miller said, suggesting that instead of the same wealthy residents moving between renting and buying, the city is seeing an influx of affluent tenants. Meanwhile, Wall Street, responsible for more than 17 percent of the city\u2019s economy, continues to bring in record profits, according to a\nrecent report from the state comptroller\n. That puts money in the pockets of wealthier workers.\nBrooklyn and Northwest Queens have seen robust rent growth, but not to the same extent as Manhattan, consistent with the growing bifurcation of the market.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn came in at $3,804 while Northwest Queens fell just slightly to $3,510. Rent in Brooklyn has increased nearly 9 percent year over year, compared to just 1.5 percent in the Queens neighborhoods of Astoria, Long Island City, Woodside and Sunnyside.\nThe local trend runs in contrast to the national picture, where rents have been mostly flat or slipping.\nThe rent numbers are sourced from residential brokers and don\u2019t include unbrokered apartments, lease renewals, or rent-stabilized apartments.\n",

        "content": "With one week to go, the City Council is considering a number of bills feared by multifamily owners and developers.\nAs of this writing, a newly amended version of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is expected to drop Wednesday. Keep an eye out for our coverage on what that entails.\nA version of the measure\nreleased\nlast week gave nonprofits or private firms that team up with nonprofits first dibs on buying distressed multifamily properties with four or more units. Those changes did not win over the bill\u2019s critics.\nWednesday was the last day for bills to be finalized (the bills need to age before coming to a vote at the final City Council meeting of the year, Dec. 18).\nHousing groups have warned against four bills that would add new restrictions to city-funded housing, including setting a minimum for the percentage of two- to three- units built in these projects, capping the percentage of studio apartments in senior projects and requiring deeper affordability.\nI asked Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani about these bills during a press conference on Tuesday, but he didn\u2019t take a position. But the New York State Tenant Bloc, headed by Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, has come out against the bills.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that the incoming administration has the capacity to write a housing plan that can deliver on the affordability agenda that the Mayor-Elect ran on,\u201d said Ritti Singh, spokesperson for the Tenant Bloc. \u201cWhile these Council term-sheet bills are well-intentioned, they will limit Mamdani\u2019s ability to deliver on the agenda tenants across the city overwhelmingly voted for. In particular, they will slow down the development pipeline significantly and create new delays and new costs to produce the affordable housing New Yorkers desperately need.\u201d\nAnother measure would create a $40 per hour minimum wage and benefit rate for construction workers on projects that receive $1 million or more in city financing. The latest version of the bill excluded projects where 90 percent or more of the units are affordable to those earning at or below 60 percent of the area media income. The laborers\u2019 union, which has been pushing for the bill\u2019s passage, was not happy about the exclusions. I was told just before 5 p.m. that a new version will be released later Wednesday.\nLandlords have also been watching\na bill\nthat would require landlords to maintain a maximum indoor temperature in their buildings, either by providing central air or individual air conditioning units.\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted on where everything lands!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat issues would you like to see\nTRD\ncover in the new year? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA new report by HR&amp;A found that eliminating New York\u2019s Scaffold Law (which holds property owners liable when construction workers are injured in height-related falls) could result in savings that would support 8 to 10 percent more affordable housing units per project in NYC. The report was commissioned by the Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which has long been critical of the law. The report found that insurance costs in New York are two to five times higher than in other states.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Comptroller Brad Lander on Wednesday launched his campaign for New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District seat,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Lander is challenging incumbent Rep. Dan Goldman, with the support of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who was considering a run and secured the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America, also announced Wednesday that she will not throw her hat in the ring. She said she didn\u2019t want to split voters in challenging Goldman.\n\u2014 The New School is trying to close a $48 million budget gap by making steep staffing, faculty and program cuts,\nGothamist reports\n. The university has offered 40 percent, or 169, full-time faculty members voluntary separation or early retirement packages. Some view the cuts as an attack on the school\u2019s liberal arts divisions. \u201cIt does seem to be designed to minimize the power of the divisions that have historically been more politically motivated,\u201d Rachel Sherman, sociology professor at the New School\u2019s Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, told the publication.\n\u2014 ICYMI, Kathryn Garcia is taking over for Rick Cotton at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,\nPolitico New York reports\n. Garcia most recently served as Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s director of state operations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$22.7 million\nfor a 3,409-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at Extell\u2019s 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$273 million\nfor a 629,323-square-foot office building at 147 East 44th Street in Grand Central. Rockwood Capital sold the 43-story property to Sovereign Partners.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,920-square-foot multi-family at 120 East 10th Street in the East Village. Yoav Blat with Compass has the listing. The property last sold for\n$5 million\nin 2018.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 152,860-square-foot, eight-story school at 4261 Broadway in Hudson Heights. Matthew McChesney filed the permit on behalf of Lloyd Goldman of BLDG Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Mila occupies a 13,000-square-foot rooftop space at 1636 Meridian Avenue owned by David Edelstein\u2019s New York-based Tricap.\nThe restaurant, owned by\nGregory Galy\nand Marine Giron-Galy, ranked second last year with $49 million in revenue.

The biggest misconception [that restaurateurs] have is what it takes to hit those numbers, even for the best of the best. When a landlord says. \u2018I need a [tenant] that can do $30 million,\u2019 you can count the number of people who can do it with one hand.\u201d\nThe South Florida restaurants on the Top 100 Independents represent the top 1 percent of the tri-county region\u2019s dining scene, Bendersky added. \u201cMiami has become a place where there is no inbetween,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that made the list are all part of fantastic groups that are the best at what they do.\u201d\nOther restaurants that made this year\u2019s list include Komodo Miami at 26 with $23.1 million in revenue, Gekko Miami at 52 with $17.3 million in revenue and\nPapi Steak Miami\nat 64 with $15 million in revenue.\nDavid Grutman\u2019s\nMiami Beach-based Groot Hospitality owns the three venues. Although Komodo Miami tumbled from sixth place last year, and Papi Steak Miami fell from 27th place in 2024. Gekko Miami was not on last year\u2019s list.\nKomodo Miami occupies a ground-floor space in an office tower at\n801 Brickell Avenue\nowned by Miami-based Gatsby Enterprises. Papi Steak leases a space at 736 First Street in Miami Beach owned by Bernard Klepach, a North Miami business man who owns duty free shops at Miami International Airport. And Gekko Miami is in a ground-floor commercial unit of the SLS Lux Brickell condominium at Eight Southwest Eighth Street owned by a Delaware entity.\nDining out in Miami is more expensive than other U.S. metros such as Dallas, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, according to Chef\u2019s Pencil, which analyzed the cost of a mid-range three-course meal in a city and compared it to the average monthly net wage there.\nA mid-range three-course meal in Miami costs an average of $60. At Mila and Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, an average meal can cost $188 and $120, respectively, according to the Top 100 Independents list.",

        "content": "Dozens of Chicago homeowners attended a meeting hosted by Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s office in West Garfield Park to learn why their property tax assessments skyrocketed.\nAmong them: Tonya Reed of Maywood, who saw her property tax bill more than double this year, rising from about $5,100 to $11,000. The county mailed almost 1.4 million tax bills on Nov. 14, with payment due Dec. 15, the\nChicago Sun Times reported\n.\nFor Reed, the tax increase pushed her monthly mortgage payment from $1,600 to $2,400, leaving her family struggling to balance household expenses. The hikes are concentrated in predominantly Black neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides, according to a Cook County treasurer\u2019s office report cited at the meeting.\nThe\nreport\nattributes the burden shift to reductions granted by the Board of Review to large commercial properties, including retail and data centers. As property values in the Loop have declined since the pandemic, residential values in lower-income neighborhoods have rebounded to pre\u2013Great Recession levels, accelerating tax increases. Other critics have pointed to the assessor\u2019s\nzero-sum tax system\n.\nOverall, Cook County\u2019s tax levy has risen, while businesses in the central district contribute less. The Board of Review recently reopened appeals for 24 townships, with a Friday deadline. Many attendees at the meeting came to seek exemptions and file appeals with the Board of Review.\nWest Garfield Park experienced the steepest increases, with median homeowner bills up nearly $2,000, or 133 percent. Longtime resident Dorothy Rosenthal questioned the accuracy of such assessments, noting her property suffered severe flooding in 2023 and remains partially unusable. Despite neighborhood improvements, she argued values could not have risen so dramatically.\nAt the meeting, residents voiced frustration that sympathy from officials does not offset the financial impact, according to the Sun Times. Kaegi has presented himself as an assessor tough on\ncommercial landlords\n, claiming that the decline in Downtown Chicago\noffice values\nwas exaggerated.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Newport Beach, California-based Irvine Company has owned the property since 2010.\nThe Benesch deal follows a lease Irvine inked with Mayer Brown, an international law firm and the building\u2019s anchor tenant, which secured 272,000 square feet in an extension about a year ago.\nPrior to Benesch\u2019s expansion, the property was already 94 percent leased, according to data from CoStar Group, reflecting strong occupancy levels in a market where many office landlords face challenges. In the post-pandemic market, some law firms have been shrinking their space, while others are growing. For example, ArentFox Schiff recently vacated more than half of its space at\nWillis Tower\nwith a long-term lease extension. But earlier this year, Rope &amp; Gray expanded by 33 percent at a\nWacker Drive skyscraper\n.\nIrvine has positioned the tower at 71 South Wacker as a workplace designed with modern amenities and thoughtful layouts that foster collaboration, a good fit for\nlegal tenants\n.\nCleveland-based Benesch, which planted its flag in Chicago in 2015, is growing its space \u201cto keep pace with our sustained growth in attorney and staff headcount,\u201d managing partner Gregg Eisenberg said in a statement to Crain\u2019s. The firm originally moved into two floors at the 1.7 million-square-foot building, added a third floor during the pandemic, and now has a fourth floor. It had an attorney headcount of 145 in Chicago as of June, or 20 more than a year prior, according to Crain\u2019s data.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Ari Klein, Scott Shelbourne and Jeff Skender represented Benesch in the lease negotiations.

        "content": "When you think Gary Barnett, you think Billionaires\u2019 Row penthouses, not run-down rental buildings.\nBut Barnett\u2019s Fifth Avenue air rights deal offers a solution for rent-stabilized properties\nin crisis\n.\nBarnett\u2019s Extell Development is acquiring 135,000 square feet of air rights from the Metropolitan Club on Fifth Avenue for his mixed-use\nproject\nat 655 Madison Avenue \u2014 a deal made possible by the City of Yes.\nThe club\u2019s 790 Fifth Avenue is a landmark. Before City of Yes, it could sell air rights to a very limited number of properties next to it, but because the market was microscopic, a deal never happened. The club is only using 42 percent of its theoretical square footage, according to PropertyScout.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, passed in 2023, allowed landmarks to\ntransfer air rights\nto sites farther away. Barnett\u2019s development site is a full avenue from the Metropolitan Club, but now it can acquire the club\u2019s rights.\nIf Extell uses the 135,000 extra square feet to build more apartments, it would mean homes for hundreds more people and millions of dollars of additional tax revenue. I think we can all agree those are good things.\nAnother plus: The Metropolitan Club will get money from the sale. Landmarks are expensive to maintain, and the sale proceeds will be used to fund continuing maintenance under a plan filed with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nGiven the extra costs that the commission imposes on buildings when it makes them landmarks, expanding their ability to sell air rights was the least the city could do.\nWhy not help rent-stabilized buildings in the same way?\nThey, too, have been burdened by the government: The state\nstrangled\ntheir revenues by\npassing the HSTPA\nin 2019. It also made the law permanent, removing landlords\u2019 leverage to negotiate changes. Demolition of these buildings is extremely difficult because tenants have a right to perpetual lease renewals.\nEven if an owner can buy out enough tenants to reach 80 or 100 percent vacancy, the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal sometimes\nrefuses\npermission to substantially rehabilitate the building and remove it from rent regulation. HCR has become\nincreasingly stingy\nabout this.\nFor many owners, there is\nno escape\nfrom this\nfinancial vise\n. All they can do is buy time by deferring maintenance.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is looking for ways to help landlords keep up their rent-stabilized buildings\nwithout raising rents\n. Giving them the ability to sell air rights to a broad range of buyers is one way to do that \u2014 and would also allow developers to build more housing, which is also\ndesperately needed\n.\nNIMBY groups such as Village Preservation and people in Queens who voted for Andrew Cuomo would voice hysterical opposition to the prospect of more apartments, but Mamdani doesn\u2019t owe them anything.\nTenant groups, meanwhile, would likely support a measure that raises money from developers and ensures it can only be spent to upgrade rental buildings. YIMBY groups would welcome the creation of housing.\nDevelopers hate Mamdani\u2019s plan to raise taxes, but they willingly pay for air rights. And unlike a tax hike, the city could liberalize air rights transfers without a new state law.\nThe housing shortage is crushing New Yorkers, and rent-stabilized buildings are falling apart. Mamdani and Julie Menin, the next City Council speaker, could get their tenures off to a strong start by creating revenue literally out of thin air for two of the city\u2019s most pressing needs.\n",

The seller, Branford Med Properties, had previously intended to develop the land for doctors before the plan fell through.\nMajestic intends to break ground in early 2026 on a four-story office building spanning 45,000 square feet to 48,000 square feet. Construction is expected to take 12 to 18 months, with Majestic managing the $10 million-plus project entirely in-house, including design and construction.\nThe building will feature a distinctive design inspired by nearby offices and highlighted by a giant \u201cM.\u201d Planned amenities include a gym, full kitchen and bar for events.\nMajestic\u2019s current headquarters spans less than 10,000 square feet at 1650 Highway 6, about two miles away, with its lease expiring at the end of next year. The company currently employs 50 to 60 people, but aims to surpass 100 employees by the end of 2026, primarily expanding its engineering team. The growth stems from plans to break ground on eight projects next year, in addition to contracting to handle projects for other firms.\nFounded in 2021 by CEO Santosh Cividi, Majestic focuses on single-family development and smaller residential projects in the Houston metro market. It recently launched its first major project, Majestic at Harvest Green, a 12-acre commercial center within Johnson Development\u2019s\nHarvest Green\n\u201cagrihood,\u201d offering retail, restaurant, office and event space.

A\ncontracting pool of available new units\n. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to blame muted purchase volume on the Mamdani election, but there\u2019s no evidence for that,\u201d Marketproof Kael Goodman said in a statement. \u201cThe simpler explanation is, inventory is low and new launches are scarce, so fewer buyers are finding what they want.\u201d\nIn the second quarter of this year, Manhattan\u2019s supply of new development condos reached a 10-year low at fewer than 3,600 unsold units, according to data previously shared with\nThe Real Deal\nby Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\nProject launches in Manhattan have been under the 10-year average for the last three years, but 2025 is shaping up to be the year when dwindling supply rears its head as buyers burn through the backlog of projects that built up around Covid.\nIn November, Manhattan saw 88 signed contracts, down from 125 last year. Nearly double the new units hit the market this fall compared to one year ago, but that rush followed few buildings coming to market during the spring \u2014 only 225 units, down from 511 last year, according to Marketproof.\nThe top-selling building in the borough has been Izaki Group\u2019s Village West project at 525 Sixth Avenue, which scored 16 contracts in November and has already put more than half of its 68 units in contract since launching sales in September.\nThe borough has seen a number of notable launches in the fall, including MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residences at 126 East 57th Street, Related Companies\u2019 144-unit Upper East Side project called the Strathmore and the Flatiron Building\u2019s hotly-anticipated conversion into 38 ultra-luxury units. But none of them has yet contributed meaningfully to the contract tally.\nThe metrics also continue to suffer from 80 Clarkson, the largest launch of the year, not reporting any contracts despite\nevidence of off-market sales\n.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d Goodman\ntold The Real Deal last week\n.\nIn Brooklyn, there were 79 new development contracts signed in November, down from 110 last year.\nFall sales launches this year in Brooklyn have accounted for 172 new units entering the market, down 50 percent from last year, according to Marketproof.\nIn 2024, the borough launched a number of large developments, including One Domino Square and Williamsburg Wharf in North Brooklyn, which combined for a collective 249 units. The Bergen in Boerum Hill also launched its 105 units in 2024. Those buildings have often alternated among the top-performing developments in the borough through much of their early sales cycles.\nBy comparison, the top-selling development in November was an eight-unit converted brownstone at 503 Clinton Ave, which signed six contracts last month.\nQueens also slowed in November, with 20 contracts signed compared to 30 last year. The borough had no new development launches through October, when Flushing\u2019s Northern Center Condominium released 11 of its 135 sponsor units. In November, two boutique projects launched 13 combined units.\nLast fall, Queens saw 361 new development units enter the market.\n",

The land is on Biscayne Island, the westernmost island on the Venetians.

In Downtown Brooklyn, his firm could be on the outs with a troubled office property.\nClipper Equity is facing foreclosure on 250 Livingston Street, with the mortgage backing the building will be sent to special servicing next week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nClipper became delinquent on the $125 million mortgage last month. The firm is considering handing the keys to the property back to the lenders, though Bistricer believes he can resolve the issue with the lenders and duck foreclosure proceedings, tapping IronHound Management to assist Clipper through negotiations.\nStill, in a filing, Clipper said it \u201cdoes not plan to continue to support the ongoing operating and debt service shortfall related to\u201d the building, and would look to sell.\nIn March, the lenders notified lawyers for Bistricer that he was in default because Clipper did not deposit all of the requisite rental revenue into a designated account. They threatened to foreclose if Clipper didn\u2019t pay off the mortgage in full, according to filings, but have yet to do so.\nThe building was\ndealt a catastrophic blow\na few months ago when the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration exited 350,000 square feet, decamping for 2440 Fulton Street. Bistricer claims the firm is in negotiations with a tenant for a portion of that space, though he did not identify the tenant or how much they would take.\nThis isn\u2019t the first financial issue Bristricer has braced for in the Brooklyn office market.\nLast year, a Morningstar Credit report identified a delinquent loan behind 141 Livingston Street. Clipper ultimately\ndefaulted\non the $100 million mortgage backing the property after Kings County Civil Court passed on a renewal at the building, leading its lenders to file for foreclosure.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, the two developers involved in the troubled Lincoln Yards megaproject, want the Chicago City Council to approve a slate of high-rise apartments and residential units, according to a new zoning application submitted to the city.\nThe proposal covers roughly 34 acres between Lincoln Park and Bucktown,\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business reported\n. Lincoln Yards is the overall name for a massive 53-acre mixed\u2011use redevelopment along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The\nnorthern section\nof the megaproject is called Foundry Park, with an estimated cost of more than $1 billion.\nThe apartment towers would exceed 450 feet, and in total Foundry Park would feature up to 3,737 housing units. Although less dense than Sterling Bay\u2019s original 14 million\u2011square\u2011foot version of the project, the plan still features large\u2011scale buildings that would significantly reshape the area.\nChicago-based Sterling Bay was the original developer that\nbacked out after the project stalled\n. The joint venture of Chicago-based JDL and Los Angeles-based Kayne Anderson bought most of\nthe site\nfrom\nBank OZK\n, which seized\u00a0 it from Sterling. The land was previously tied to the former Finkl steel mill and General Iron operations.\nJDL, led by CEO Jim Letchinger, is the developer on the project, with Kanye Anderson, led by CEO Albert Rabil as the equity partner.\nThe zoning application outlines a program combining single\u2011family homes, townhomes, condos and rental units, along with 350,000 square feet of office space, 420,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, plus 250,000 square feet of hospitality. The developers intend to build 3,207 units initially \u2014 305 for-sale homes and 2,902 rentals \u2014 including 641 affordable units for households earning an average of 60 percent of area median income.\nThe plan incorporates 12 acres of open space, six parks and a walk spanning most of the site\u2019s 3,000 feet of river frontage. Southport Avenue would serve as the project\u2019s primary corridor, lined with mid\u2011rise and high\u2011rise residential buildings and a hotel.\nThe first phase would rise on a triangular parcel bounded by Southport Avenue, West Cortland Street and North Kingsbury Street.\nA key complication is Sterling Bay\u2019s continued ownership of a northern parcel within the existing planned development. Sterling Bay consented to the rezoning only on the condition that it retains rights to build 400 units on its property.\nCity planning officials have emphasized the need for new infrastructure to manage traffic and improve site access. Negotiations continue over revisions to the existing redevelopment agreement, originally crafted for Lincoln Yards, which envisioned up to $490 million in infrastructure reimbursable with tax increment financing. Foundry Park\u2019s lower density may reduce the need for large infrastructure, though improvements to Dominick Street, Southport and a potential Southport\u2011Throop bridge remain under discussion.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

The deal is expected to close within the next two months. The exact deposit amount has not been disclosed.\nThe Recovery Fund, led by SKS Partners veteran Dan Kingsley and private equity alum Jay Yang, first entered a\ncontract to buy\nthe development site in September. With the deposit handed down, the Fund is nearing official ownership of the site.\nOceanwide Center\u2019s history dates back a decade when Chinese developer Oceanwide Holdings acquired the site in 2015 for nearly $300 million. At the time, the developer plotted to build a 2-million-square-foot mixed-use project with one 605-foot tower with hotel and residences and another 910-foot tower with offices and residential units. Groundbreaking was held the following year.\nIn 2019, Oceanwide Holdings started looking for new capital funding for the project. The firm sought development partners or buyers who would completely take over the project. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based company paused work on its mixed-use\nOceanwide Plaza project in Los Angeles\n, which sits abandoned and\ncovered in graffiti\ntoday.\nOceanwide Holdings stopped construction on Oceanwide Center\u2019s shorter building in 2019 and similarly paused work on the taller tower in the fall of 2020. The project came to a halt as the complex\u2019s ground-floor concrete structure was completed.\nOceanwide subsequently entered various possible deals with development and capital partners, but none of them ever came to fruition.\nCreditors seized the project site\nin 2021 after missed payments on $321.5 million of debt, and stakeholders are still involved in litigation over unpaid bills. Those companies still have about $21 million in liens on the Oceanwide site, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "John Novak is rapidly ascending the ranks of Chicago developers by striking a deal to buy the troubled southern portion of Lincoln Yards from JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling Bay, following the sellers\u2019 failure to bring a massive commercial real estate plan to fruition.\nAn affiliate of Novak\u2019s contracting firm,\nNovak Construction\n, is moving forward with the acquisition of 18.4 acres of vacant riverfront land where Chicago-based Sterling Bay had proposed a huge mixed-use campus. It\u2019s just west of the empty life sciences building Sterling built at 1229 West Concord Place, John Novak and his firm\u2019s executive vice president of development, Jake Paschen, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile they declined to comment on the price of the acquisition, they confirmed it\u2019s well below the roughly $200 million Sterling and JP Morgan spent to assemble the parcels during the 2010s, as well as to prepare the parcels for development and carry them since then, according to people familiar with the project.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is at the bottom of the bottom, but I think there is more room for upside here than downside,\u201d Novak said. \u201cWe just need to figure out what will be the best value and use of the land.\u201d\nNovak expects to close before the end of 2025.\nThe deal brings a new face to a site that has become synonymous with development struggles in Chicago. Real estate insiders frame the acquisition as a distress sale, reflecting the difficulty the current owners have had in moving forward with the large redevelopment plan. The land, part of the larger, ambitious $6 billion mixed-use Lincoln Yards development, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and is changing hands as the original vision dissipated over the last two years.\nThe planned purchase marks the second time this year that a deal for the southern portion of the site has been put together, underscoring the urgency with which JP Morgan and Sterling Bay are now offloading the property. The first attempt to sell the site earlier this year to developers\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n, at a price Chicago real estate sources pegged at about $60 million, ultimately fell apart.\nThat deal disintegrated after\nJP Morgan balked\non completing the transaction, leaving the future of the parcel uncertain until the recent emergence of Novak. Kayne and JDL this year formed a development team to buy the northern 30-plus acres of Lincoln Yards from\nBank OZK, which stripped that assemblage\nfrom Sterling Bay and its other partner, Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. JDL and Kayne have since sought Chicago City Council approval to build\nmore than 3,700 residential units\non that stretch, which sits on the other side of the Chicago River from Novak\u2019s planned purchase.\n\u201cThe Lincoln Yards south property remains a huge opportunity, and we are interested in seeing it succeed,\u201d a spokesperson for Sterling Bay said.\nA spokesperson for JP Morgan declined to comment.\nFor Novak, the acquisition is a calculated risk and a major expansion of his development portfolio. The site along the Chicago River is considered a prime, albeit challenging, development opportunity. He has yet to decide what kind of buildings he will ultimately pursue for the site.\nThe overall Lincoln Yards project has been plagued by a number of issues, including initial political opposition to the massive public subsidies granted for the development, market volatility and a slowdown in commercial real estate demand that has hit large-scale office and retail projects particularly hard. The development was initially pitched as a comprehensive neighborhood with residential, commercial and entertainment components, transforming a former industrial area into a vibrant new section of Chicago.\nThe latest deal, led by an affiliate of Novak\u2019s firm, signals a renewed attempt to capitalize on the riverfront location and unlock the value of the land.\nNovak\u2019s firm was founded in 1980 as a general contractor, which remains its main business. But in the last five years it has accelerated its development efforts, Paschen and Novak said. Its development projects include the Whole Foods on West Belmont and Ashland avenues in Lakeview, as well as a 206-unit multifamily project with a 50,000-square-foot Target store in the Portage Park neighborhood, among other properties.\nNovak said the Lincoln Yards deal will mark the biggest amount of land his firm has purchased for development, but it isn\u2019t the largest in terms of the dollar amount of his other projects. He has also developed a $70 million medical office facility for the\nRush University\nhealth care system at 1630 North Harlem Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Pro-development organization YIMBY Law is taking\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nto court for his executive order banning Senate Bill 9\u2019s application in Los Angeles neighborhoods burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nYIMBY Law\u2019s lawsuit\n, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that Newsom unlawfully restricted homeowners\u2019 ability to rebuild by giving local governments the green light to shelve SB 9, the 2021 state law that permits duplex construction and lot-splitting on parcels zoned for single-family homes, Politico\nreported\n.\nResidents in the Pacific Palisades appealed to Newsom over the summer to stop SB 9\u2019s implementation, fearing that allowing duplexes and split lots would diminish the neighborhood\u2019s character and make evacuation efforts in future fires worse.\nMayor Karen Bass\nand City Council member Traci Park similarly\nexpressed their opposition\nto SB 9\u2019s use in the Palisades.\nNewsom issued his order in July in response to the lobbying, from people including reality TV star and Palisades resident\nSpencer Pratt\n.\n\u201cMy parents survived the Eaton fire, but our home didn\u2019t,\u201d Altadena resident Andrew Post said in a news release from YIMBY Law. \u201cNow, as we want to rebuild and come back to the community we love, we\u2019re staring down costs we can\u2019t meet. SB 9 isn\u2019t a danger, it\u2019s a lifeline. It gives people like us a real chance to rebuild by creating rental income or making space for multiple generations and families to live on the same land. Taking that option away means pushing out the very people who are trying hardest to come back.\u201d\nAfter the governor handed down his order, the city governments of Los Angeles, Malibu and Pasadena, as well as Los Angeles County, put the kibosh on SB 9 rebuilds in areas prone to fires. YIMBY Law\u2019s suit includes each local jurisdiction as a defendant. The nonprofit claims SB 9 provides cash-strapped property owners the opportunity to earn rental income or sell a portion of their lot to pay for their rebuilding efforts.\nThe San Francisco-based group was in talks with Newsom\u2019s team last week about standing down on its lawsuit if the governor agreed to allow duplex construction after a year, YIMBY Law executive director Sonja Trauss told Politico. The Newsom camp didn\u2019t act, prompting the organization to pursue legal action.\nMost homeowners were under-insured, and now rents are spiking, land values are falling, and rebuilding costs are astronomical,\u201d Trauss said in a statement. \u201cMaking it harder for families to use the single most impactful tool they have left \u2014 their land \u2014 doesn\u2019t make recovery safer. It raises the barrier of who gets to come back at all.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s team swiftly rebuked the lawsuit.\n\u201cWe will not allow outside groups \u2014 even longstanding allies \u2014 to attack the Palisades, and communities in the highest fire risk areas throughout L.A. County, or undermine local flexibility to rebuild after the horror of these fires,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cOur obligation is to survivors, full stop. We will not negotiate that away. If defending them requires drawing firm lines, we will draw them.\u201d\nPark, who represents the Palisades, also shared her disappointment with YIMBY Law\u2019s complaint.\n\u201cAfter what this community just lived through, the idea of forcing more density into a high-fire-severity zone demonstrates this isn\u2019t about sound housing policy, but ideological extremism,\u201d Park told Politico.\nWhether the banning of SB 9 in these neighborhoods was legal remains a question to be answered by the court as part of YIMBY Law\u2019s case.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Indicted attorney Mark Nussbaum revealed the list of all his creditors and debtors, providing more clues of where the missing money from his firm\u2019s escrow accounts went.\nThe lion\u2019s share of missing cash appears to stem from funds transferred to the late real estate investor Mendel Steiner, who Nussbaum claims owes over $306 million. Other notable names are: Shaya Prager, Eli Puretz, Boruch Drillman and Yanky Tauber.\nThe new filings provide a window into what went wrong for the once high-flying lawyer, whose law firm has about $400 million in unpaid creditors. Nussbaum provided the list of all the people who allegedly owe him money as part of an alternative to bankruptcy.\nNussbaum, who ran Manhattan-based Nussbaum Lowinger, used his law firm\u2019s escrow fund accounts to make bridge loans to real estate dealmakers, according to sources familiar with the situation. Often, his firm would provide money for one day so that the dealmaker could show a seller they were capitalized.\nBut Nussbaum started running a deficit, and investors and high-interest lenders who provided the funds for Nussbaum\u2019s escrow business started filing lawsuits seeking to recoup their money. Nussbaum\u2019s law firm shut down. In May, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office charged Nussbaum with grand larceny, alleging he stole over $15 million in client escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nCreditors allege in a new lawsuit that much of the funds were diverted to Steiner through phony escrow accounts.\nThe new information comes to light as Nussbaum started an alternative bankruptcy process, known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC), as a way to try to pay back his law firm\u2019s many creditors. As part of that process, Nussbaum had to provide a list of creditors along with the assets of his estate to the assignee of the ABC.\n\u201cAs he has from the outset, Mr. Nussbaum continues to provide exceptional assistance to the assignee. This includes providing information and troves of documents, as well as meeting with the assignee and its representatives on dozens of occasions for countless hours,\u201d said an attorney for Nussbaum in a statement. \u201cMr. Nussbaum fully supports the assignee\u2019s efforts to marshal assets from bona fide sources, including the Steiner estate, and he will continue to assist the assignee to the best of his ability to ensure maximum recovery for the creditors.\u201d\nNussbaum\u2019s assets included jewelry, wine and cryptocurrency, but his largest asset is his accounts receivables. Nussbaum has hundreds of millions of dollars on the street and borrowers who had not paid him back.\nSome of Nussbaum\u2019s notable debtors include participants in mortgage fraud schemes that led to charges by the Department of Justice. Others include nursing home investors and syndicators, according to Nussbaum\u2019s filing.\nBoruch Drillman\n, a co-conspirator who played a minor role in a $165 million mortgage fraud scheme and was not sentenced to any jail time, owes $4.7 million.\nEli Puretz, a co-conspirator in a $54.5 million mortgage fraud scheme involving an office complex in Troy, Michigan, owes $4.1 million.\nOpal Holdings head\nShaya Prager\n, a controversial investor who has come under pressure from lenders over his ground lease-structures within a multi-billion-dollar office portfolio, owes $1.1 million.\nYanky Tauber\n, Nussbaum\u2019s deal partner on Chicago real estate, owes $1.5 million.\nMike Silber, the brother of Moshe Silber, who pleaded guilty in a $119 million mortgage fraud scheme involving an apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, owes $2.25 million.\nSteve Chopp, a nursing home owner tied to Indigo Manner and Opal Healthcare, owes $3 million.\nThe filings also reveal more about the scale of Nussbaum\u2019s real estate operations. In addition to lending to real estate dealmakers, Nussbaum acquired real estate properties. His assets consisted of properties scattered throughout the country, including in Chicago; Brooklyn; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Long Island, according to his filings.\nHe listed a 346,000-square-foot office park in Lake Success, New York as his most valuable real estate asset at $33 million. Other real estate interests include walk-ups at 1596 and 1474 Pacific Street in Brooklyn, as well as 1049 Bergen Street in Brooklyn.\nNussbaum\u2019s assets include: $2 million in crypto; $91,000 in wine and alcohol, including a $1,000 bottle of Glendronach scotch. He also reported that he sold over $200,000 in watches and jewelry.\nNussbaum provided a long list of creditors who he or his firms owe money to, including Jacob Sod \u2014 the nursing home owner who initiated the litigation against Nussbaum\u2019s law firm \u2014 who has a claim of $14.2 million.\nSomeone named S. Zafir is the largest creditor, with a $148 million claim. Miriam Nussbaum, Nussbaum\u2019s mother, is owed over $1 million, according to Nussbaum\u2019s filings.\nWhile some of Nussbaum\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims stretch into the millions, there are dozens for smaller amounts, including over $500,000 owed to Lazer Preizler of the hard money lender Cashable.\nNussbaum\u2019s ability to collect on the many loans he made has proven to be difficult because of the indictment and charges brought by the Manhattan D.A.\nSimilarly, calculating the value of Nussbaum\u2019s existing real estate has been a challenge.\nMark Nussbaum\nand his deal partner, Eli Tauber, have been hit with a combined 29 foreclosure lawsuits for real estate across the South and West sides of Chicago.\nNussbaum does not appear to know the exact state of his properties with Eli\u2019s son Yanky Tauber. In Nussbaum\u2019s filings, he mentioned that some of his real estate with Tauber has been sold or transferred.\n",

        "content": "Despite efforts to stop the sale, Meyer Chetrit\u2019s ownership interests in four property-holding companies have been sold at auction to pay off a lender.\nThe buyers were Meyer\u2019s brother, Juda Chetrit, and an entity associated with lender Maverick Real Estate Partners.\nThe sale, held on Tuesday, was the\nlatest episode\nin the legal saga between Meyer Chetrit and Maverick Real Estate Partners, which is trying to collect on a $132 million judgment from the prominent developer connected to a now-foreclosed Manhattan hotel property. Chetrit served as a guarantor on the loan. Now that he hasn\u2019t paid a judgment ordered in June, his interests have been garnished and are being auctioned off to pay for the judgment.\nThe public sale held on Tuesday didn\u2019t draw any new faces. In a conference room at the offices of law firm Fox Rothschild, Juda Chetrit and Thomas Hooker, a representative for Maverick, traded bids on Meyer\u2019s ownership interests.\nJuda Chetrit was flanked by his son Michael, who now heads the Chetrit Organization. The two sat on the other end of a conference table from Meyer, separated by attorneys. Juda and Michael bid, seemingly reluctantly, on Meyer\u2019s interests in a company that owns several industrial lots in Maspeth, Queens. That includes a warehouse at 57-18 Flushing Avenue.\nBut Maverick\u2019s deeper pockets won out. The firm\u2019s representative agreed to pay $9.8 million for the interest.\nThe Maverick associate also agreed to pay $1 million for a pair of LLCs associated with a largely undeveloped lot in Woodside at 70-50 Queens Boulevard. The lot was previously home to an Entemann\u2019s bakery outlet. According to court documents from Meyer Chetrit, the developer effectively has a 16.5 percent interest in the property, which he says is worth between $12 million and $15 million, but has no income. Chetrit\u2019s lawyers say the value of his interest in the property is negative or negligible, given that the property is encumbered by a $5 million mortgage and owes other funds to a managing member.\nJuda Chetrit won a bidding exchange to pay $750,000 for Meyer\u2019s interests in an LLC tied to two condo units at 49-51 Chambers Street in Manhattan. The units are worth about $6.5 million, according to an affidavit from Meyer. They have been cross-collateralized with other assets for a $9.5 million mortgage. Juda is already a member of the company owning the condos, according to an affidavit he filed in court. The two are unsold sponsor units from an office-to-condo conversion that opened in 2017.\nMeyer and Juda Chetrit head different organizations, the Chetrit Group and Chetrit Organization, respectively, but still conduct some deals together. The two, with their brother Joseph and\nlate brother Jacob\n, together comprised the patriarchs of the influential development family.\nLawyers for Meyer Chetrit, including\nattorney Leo Jacobs\n, attempted to stop the sale. They petitioned the court to pause the auction, arguing that the sale would depress Chetrit\u2019s ability to pay the $132 million judgment and fail to generate maximum value. Chetrit is \u201cwilling to consider\u201d a sale marketed by a broker, according to the petition.\n\u201cChetrit has even been compelled to consider filing for personal bankruptcy,\u201d the petition says. Personal bankruptcy would potentially put a pause on litigation and collection efforts.\nA lower court judge declined to put a temporary restraining order on the sale. Chetrit\u2019s lawyers appealed that decision, but the case is still pending. Jacobs said he objected to how the sale was conducted, saying the terms of sale needed to be distributed prior to the auction and bidders needed to be registered.\n\u201cToday\u2019s auction is a textbook definition of how not to conduct an auction,\u201d Jacobs said in a statement.\nTwo rounds of the auction were conducted before the terms of sale were distributed. Jacobs objected, prompting a do-over of the sales.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Maverick and Chetrit have found themselves in court over the $132 million judgment, which originated from a default on a loan connected to a yet-to-open hotel tower at 255 West 34th Street.\nThe lender previously tried to halt payments between Chetrit and business associates, claiming they were\nfraudulent attempts to shield his assets\n.\nThe courtroom drama is just one of the problems facing Chetrit. The developer and his brother Joseph were\nindicted earlier this year\nfor allegedly harassing septuagenarians in a rent-regulated loft unit. The Chetrits, through attorneys, have denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.\n",

The brokerage previously helped Veris sell six Harborside buildings for a total of $609 million.\nIn 2023, Related\npaid $58 million\nfor Harborside 4, planning an 800,000-square-foot luxury multifamily complex as its first project of that asset type in the Garden State. 601W Companies acquired the office buildings at Harborside 1, 2 and 3 for $420 million\nPanepinto has other major fires in the Jersey City development oven.\nIronstate Development Company and Panepinto recently\nsecured $340 million\nin balance sheet loans for 50 and 70 Columbus, the joint venture\u2019s 938-unit mixed-use complex on the city\u2019s waterfront district.\nThe twin high-rises, built in 2007 and 2015, stand 36 and 48 stories tall over the Grove Street Path station. The properties are more than 98 percent leased as of September and include nearly 28,000 square feet of retail space, which is fully occupied.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Katz\u2019s family run firm is a prolific investor in South Florida shopping centers, buying and selling properties that consistently trade at competitive prices. A former professional basketball player,\nKatz\nis also a minority owner of the Miami Heat.\nRK paid $391 a square foot for the 92,007-square-foot retail facility. That\u2019s about $8.6 million above the previous sale price six years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Toronto-based Northbridge Capital, led by Stuart, Michael and Adam Lazier, paid $27.4 million for the\n10.2-acre site\nin 2019, records show. The property is adjacent to a Walmart Supercenter that was built by the same developer,\nGatlin Development Co\n. The big box store and the shopping center were completed between 2017 and 2019.\nRiverbend Marketplace\u2019s tenants include Marshalls, Planet Fitness, Five Below, Wells Fargo and Chipotle.\nRiverbend is the second Broward shopping center that RK bought this year. In April, an RK affiliate paid\n$16.4 million\nfor Shoppes at Monarch Lakes, a Miramar shopping center anchored by a Publix supermarket. Other tenants include Dunkin\u2019, Subway and Banfield Pet Hospital. Katz\u2019s company also bought a furniture showroom in Pembroke Pines for\n$15.2 million\nin January.\nA flurry of shopping center deals have closed recently in Broward.\nIn Coral Springs, four such properties traded last month. Coral Gables-based Maven Real Estate bought Atlantic Crossings, a shopping center anchored by Whole Foods and Home Depot stores, for\n$40.5 million\n. New York-based financial giant JPMorgan dropped $53.7 million for Shoppes at Heron Lakes, a pair of retail buildings featuring tenants such as Crunch Fitness, the Fish Joint and Aldo Cleaners. Two other shopping centers were sold for\n$26.5 million\nand\n$60.5 million\n.\nIn October, Hollywood-based JBL Asset Management paid\n$25 million\nfor Palm Square, a shopping center in the firm\u2019s home city.\nOverall, Broward\u2019s retail leasing is holding steady. In the third quarter, the county\u2019s retail landlords experienced a vacancy rate of 3.9 percent, relatively unchanged from the same period last year when it was 3.7 percent, according to Colliers. The average asking rent in the third quarter rose to $28.76 a square foot compared to $27.86 a square foot during the same period last year.",

The deal was financed with $113 million in senior secured debt from Northwind Group and $100 million in equity, including $25 million in preferred equity from Atlas Capital Group.\nThe financing covers the acquisition and predevelopment phase of the project, according to the release.\nThe closing comes almost two years after Landau, the former CEO of Fortis Property Group,\nfiled plans\nwith the Department of Buildings for a 47-story tower.\nThe mixed-use project will include 46 condo units, 90 rental apartments and 40,000 square feet of retail space. Construction is expected to begin early next year.\nThe release indicates that the Cayre family\u2019s Midtown Equities, which had bought the site for $33 million in 2010, is staying on as one of the project\u2019s sponsors. The family had put the site up\nfor sale in 2015, seeking $200 million\n.\nThe release does not indicate what plans exist, if any, for the neighboring 195 Montague Street, which had been included as part of the initial building application filed by Landau last year.\nThe site sits at the intersection of Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn. If completed, the 672-foot tower will be one of the neighborhood\u2019s tallest properties, and a marked divergence from the brownstone-lined streets that have drawn\nrecord townhouse deals.\nEstreich\u2019s Raffi Landau represented Northwind and Rosewood Realty Group\u2019s Aaron Jungreis represented Atlas in the deal.\nThe project \u201cis well positioned to benefit from sustained demand in this supply-stricken neighborhood,\u201d Ran Eliasaf, Northwind founder and managing partner, said in a statement.\nLandau is making good on his forecast issued during a panel at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s New York Forum,\nwhen he said\nit\u2019s a \u201cdamn good time to be building in New York City.\u201d\nThe developer\u2019s other projects since leaving Fortis have been in South Florida.

        "content": "Turnbridge Equities closed on a debt-laden piece of land in a desert resort city,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe real estate investment company purchased the SilverRock Resort development in La Quinta out of bankruptcy for $65 million, a steep discount compared to prior debt and value estimates. Turnbridge is planning to develop a luxury hotel, branded condominiums and estates. Phase one of the development is estimated to cost $735 million. Lionheart Strategic Management provided pre-development financing.\nThe unfinished resort\u2019s prior developer, Robert Green, defaulted on debt and later filed for bankruptcy \u2014 $270.5 million in claims, all told, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Robert Green Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPrior estimates put the property\u2019s value at $300 million to $400 million, the Desert Sun\nreported\n.\nThe 130-acre purchase comes after years of delays and about a year in bankruptcy court. The deal works out to $500,000 per acre and was approved by the court in October.\nTurnbridge\nwanted to purchase the development as soon as it entered bankruptcy, founder and managing principal Andrew Joblon said. Turnbridge West Coast managing director Michael Gazzano is on the project.\nGreen, who was sued by the city over delays before declaring bankruptcy, led the project for a decade. He had plans to develop residential, commercial and two hotels on the land. The hotels were supposed to have Montage and Pendry flags.\nTurnbridge plans to develop one five-star hotel, not two \u2014 although it hasn\u2019t struck a deal yet. Estates and branded condominiums are part of the plan as well. The acreage is entitled for hotel rooms, condos and estates, and the company has options to buy another 200 acres. Once the hotel opens, the 165-acre SilverRock Golf Course, owned by the city but set to be transferred, would follow.\nThe property, at 79179 Ahmanson Lane, isn\u2019t far from where the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach Music Festival are held.\nThe site is within the greater Palm Springs\narea\n. It is near the Hideaway and the Madison Club, two ultra-exclusive golf and residential communities. The latter is\nhome\nto some\nA-list celebrities and executives\n.\n",

        "content": "NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust is advancing its $445 million plan to transform Dallas\u2019 Cityplace Tower into a large mixed\u2011use development.\nDuring an investor call on Tuesday, the firm reported significant progress on financing, design and hotel logistics for repositioning the 42\u2011story, 560\u2011foot tower along U.S. 75, the\nDallas Business Journal reported\n. NexPoint,\nbased in Dallas\n, acquired the property in 2018.\nThe redevelopment gained momentum after Neiman Marcus announced\nearlier this year\nthat it would vacate its headquarters in the building after only two years. NexPoint \u2019s plan calls for converting portions of the existing office tower into residential units and hotel rooms, while adding eight six\u2011story apartment buildings across the largely underdeveloped land surrounding 2711 North Haskell Avenue.\nThe redevelopment is structured in four phases, with the first major component \u2014 known as \u201cThe Apron\u201d \u2014 focused on building 465 apartments on 5.6 acres adjacent to the tower.\nNexPoint Executive Vice President Matt McGraner said the company has received \u201caccretive financing proposals\u201d for The Apron and expects to select a lender within 30 to 60 days.\nGroundbreaking is anticipated within six to nine months.\nOn the hospitality side, NexPoint is working with Marriott International, which has proposed two lifestyle hotel brands aimed at complementing the project\u2019s upscale residences. Marriott previously pitched a business\u2011oriented hotel concept, but has since shifted direction to better align with the project. NexPoint also worked with the company on the\nMarriott Dallas Uptown\nproperty.\nMcGraner also discussed broader multifamily market dynamics, noting that the national supply cycle is peaking. CoStar projects annual completions across the U.S. of 695,000 units \u2014 about 3.5 percent of inventory \u2014 over the next year, followed by sharp declines: a 27 percent year\u2011over\u2011year drop in 2026, and a further 20 percent decline in 2027. This slowdown is expected to push the market from today\u2019s\ncompetitive lease\u2011up environment\ninto a supply\u2011constrained period characterized by renewed rent growth.\nNexPoint believes the timing will prove advantageous for Cityplace, positioning the project to have its new units completed as national supply tightens. The building, built in 1988 and originally envisioned as part of a two\u2011tower complex connected by a sky bridge, remains the tallest building in Dallas outside the Downtown core.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "A board election at a Sunny Isles Beach condo tower devolved into chaos, with multiple people arguing and one person grabbing and tearing ballots, leading officials to cancel the election with plans to reschedule it, according to police.\nThe fracas erupted on Wednesday during a meeting tied to the election at the St. Tropez on the Bay II condominium association, a 96-unit building part of the three-tower St. Tropez complex on Northeast 163rd Street/Sunny Isles Boulevard.\nIt marks the latest example of tensions erupting at a South Florida condo association meeting, as condo owners at many properties have for years clashed with board members, sometimes pulling in the\nattorneys and managers\nhired to assist associations.\nPolice arrived at St. Tropez II, 200 Sunny Isles Boulevard, shortly after noon and saw Jacob Gold, the husband of a unit owner, \u201cblocking the doorway and refusing access\u201d to people trying to enter the room where the meeting was held, according to a Sunny Isles police report. A short time later, as arguments continued, Gold \u201creached into the [ballot] box and tore several ballots.\u201d\nA Facebook video gives a glimpse into the situation, showing people yelling and a police officer grabbing a man by his bookbag, escorting him away from the commotion. The man is holding pieces of paper that appear to be ballots. The video was posted by a user with the name St. Tropez on the Bay II on the Sunny Isles Beach Insider Facebook page.\nGary Mars, the association attorney, told officers that the association president was trying to cancel the election, \u201cwhich prompted Mr. Gold to obstruct entry,\u201d the police report says.\nGold, who said he was at the meeting \u201cas the president\u2019s assistant,\u201d didn\u2019t deny he stepped in at the meeting and said he had reason to.\nHe alleges the meeting was the culmination of weeks of infighting between association president Boris Benjaminov and its property management firm, KW Property Management. Gold alleges that KW had \u201chijacked\u201d the election process and organized it as \u201can outsider,\u201d even though the board or the president have to vote on and have final say on election procedures. KW acted without permission from the board, Gold said. He also said some unit owners reported issues with the online voting system.\nBenjaminov couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. KW didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThat basic prerequisite of having a board or the proper officer acting on behalf of the board calling for an annual meeting for the election never happened,\u201d Gold said. \u201cI may not be the most popular guy for stepping in but at least in helping the president, we are going to have a proper election.\u201d\nNow, they will seek a court order to have an independent monitor oversee the election, Gold said. He said that if he hadn\u2019t acted, then St. Tropez residents would today have \u201ctwo boards, two presidents and a referee for the next year.\u201d\nCriminal charges weren\u2019t pressed against Gold, according to the police report.\nMars said the election will be held at a future meeting. He declined to comment further.\nThe St. Tropez on the Bay II Facebook user alleged Gold isn\u2019t a unit owner at the building but a guest of his wife. Gold declined to address whether he owns a St. Tropez condo. He said he won\u2019t be \u201cdiscussing personal issues.\u201d\nGold is not listed in property records as a unit owner.\n\u201cWhether or not I live there is irrelevant,\u201d he added.\nBoard elections are a common source of issues at South Florida condo associations. After months of litigation at the two-tower\n1060 Brickell\ncondo in Miami\u2019s Brickell, a judge sided with unit owners seeking to oust former president Jacob Kessler. In September, the judge\nordered\na new board to replace the former directors and also ordered the former directors to turn over all records and control of the association.\nSouth Florida\u2019s largest homeowners association, The Hammocks, was at the center of the\nbiggest alleged board fraud scheme\nin recent memory in which ex-leaders allegedly siphoned millions of dollars from HOA coffers. The Hammocks also had issues with elections: At the 2022 election, before police arrested four former board members and the husband of one of the ex-board members, voting polls closed early, infuriating homeowners. The former board cited a bomb threat for the early closure, but investigators said the HOA never provided\nproof of this\n.\nThe former Hammocks president, another ex-board member and the third person arrested have pleaded not guilty, and are awaiting trial. Two other board members arrested pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators.\n",

Monument originally purchased the property for $68 million in 2017.\nThe Element is classified as workforce housing, offering rents affordable to tenants who earn too much to qualify for subsidies, but struggle with full market\u2011rate pricing. The complex\u2019s average asking rent is $1,658 per month, or $1.69 per square foot, according to CoStar. By comparison, suburban Chicago\u2019s median net rent reached $2.15 per square foot in the third quarter, a 3.2 percent year\u2011over\u2011year increase, Integra Realty Resources reported.\nThe Bender\u2011Eastham partnership financed the Mount Prospect acquisition with a $60.8 million, seven\u2011year Fannie Mae loan arranged by Northmarq Managing Director Brett Hood. In January, the two companies jointly acquired a Hoffman Estates\napartment complex\nfor $75.8 million.\nBoth Bender and Eastham have experience in the Chicago suburban multifamily market, where projects\ngenerally trade\nat higher valuations as people avoid homebuying due to high interest rates, Crain\u2019s noted, with Mount Prospect a particularly\nactive market\n.\nChicago-based Bender Companies is an owner-operator of multifamily properties in Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, according to its website. Principal Kurt Bender founded the company in 2011. Earlier this year the company sold a suburban\napartment property\nin Carol Stream for $54 million.\nBender told Crain\u2019s in an email that suburban Chicago is the company\u2019s strongest market for occupancy.\nBoca Raton, Florida-based Eastham Capital is a private equity firm specializing in multifamily and working with both market-rate apartments and affordable housing. It usually takes an equity stake in exchange for a $5 million to $25 million investment, according to its website.\nMiami-based Monument Capital did not comment on the sale.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "The San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund scored a major funding injection to help make affordable housing construction more feasible for developers.\nThe Financial District-based nonprofit has raised $50 million for its Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, bringing the total investment to $100 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund launched last year with an\ninitial $50 million investment\nfrom\nApple\n,\nSobrato Philanthropies\nand Destination: Home. The fund was created to provide developers with low-cost financing to aid in paying construction costs for affordable housing projects. The new round of funding includes commitments from Valhalla Impact, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, philanthropists Leah and Ben Spero and congressional candidate Saikat Chakrabarti.\nFlush with $100 million, SFHAF\u2019s Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund will reportedly help to finance and build more than 1,000 affordable homes in the next two years.\nThe Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund offers traditional first mortgage loans as well as second mortgage loans repayable from projects\u2019 residual cash flow. The fund centers around developments that \u201cutilize innovative design, construction and financing approaches to deliver homes faster and at lower cost compared to traditionally financed projects, targeting completion twice as fast and at cost savings of 25 percent or more,\u201d the Housing Accelerator Fund said, per the Chronicle.\nCase in point: SFHAF\u2019s first project, a 145-unit residential property in San Francisco for formerly homeless seniors, cost $525,000 per unit \u2014 a deal considering 17 of the last 23 affordable housing projects in San Francisco that received state tax credit funding in recent years cost more than $900,000 per unit. That development at 1633 Valencia Street is set to complete later this month.\nAnother project, dubbed Harvey West Studios, is underway in Santa Cruz. When completed next year, it will be Santa Cruz County\u2019s largest permanent supportive housing development.\nWith a beefed-up Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, the Housing Accelerator Fund is looking to invest in several new endeavors, already committing to\nAffirmed Housing\u2019s transit-oriented development\nplan next to the Berryessa BART station in north San Jose. That 195-unit project will consist entirely of affordable residences and is expected to cost less than $750,000 per unit.\nOther affordable projects tied to the Housing Innovation Fund are reportedly being considered in Alameda, San Mateo and San Francisco Counties, according to the Chronicle. Those developments are expected to be announced early next year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

With a listing price of $3.5 million, the top contract was for a six-bedroom, six-bathroom spec home about 40 minutes west of Downtown Austin at 16114 Cool Breeze Cove.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but the asking price amounts to about $600 per square foot for 5,700-square-foot home.\nA husband-and-wife team constructed and sold the property. Terra Builders, a local custom homebuilding company owned by Jim and Julie Lavender, completed the house this year. Julie Lavender is the listing agent.\nThe cul-de-sac property sits on 2.6 acres near Little Barton Creek, and the lot has already been pre-approved for a 900-square-foot guest house, according to the listing. Amenities include a pool, an outdoor kitchen and a secret room.\nThe second-most expensive luxury home to go under contract last week was also recently built, in 2024, though not apparently as a spec project. The 4,500-square-foot house, at 4107 North Hills Drive in the Northwest Hills neighborhood, has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It was initially meant to be the sellers\u2019 \u201cforever home,\u201d according to Moreland Properties agent Greg Walling. The sellers, Tamir and Marina Hardof, had priced the home at $3.46 million when the contract was signed, or about $770 per square foot. The tech-packed property is pure Austin with Tesla Poweralls, solar panels and a full smart-home system.\nNotably, the\nspec home held fast to its original $3.5 million listing price\n. The resale home\u00a0 originally listed for $3.75 million in September. Its price was cut in October and November, representing a\ncommon struggle\nfor luxury resale inventory in\nAustin\n, especially for\nsellers who bought their homes during the mid- and post-pandemic boom\n.\n",

        "content": "City Council members have several housing-related bills on their desks, including a new version of the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA, and measures that some groups estimate will drive up the cost of city-funded housing by millions of dollars.\nCouncil members worked to finalize these bills on Wednesday to ensure they could be voted on at their final meeting of the year \u2014 and under the Adams administration \u2014 next week. Bills must age seven days (not including Sundays) before they can be called to a vote.\nAging doesn\u2019t guarantee a bill will be placed on the next agenda, but several measures closely watched, and in many cases feared, by property owners and developers are eligible.\n\u201cIf the most recent legislation aged by the City Council is approved next week, the real-world effect is simple: we will build less housing,\u201d Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan said in a statement.\nCOPA, amended\nIn preparation for next week, the Council released a new version of COPA that applies to a smaller universe of multifamily buildings and would further reduce the time that nonprofits (and, if applicable, their private partners) are given first dibs to buy these properties. The basic principle, however, is the same: When the owner of certain multifamily buildings decides to sell, they have to first allow nonprofits approved by the city (or private companies, also approved by the city, that partner with nonprofits) the first chance to bid on the buildings.\nThe latest version of the measure, sponsored by Council member Sandy Nurse, still applies to multifamily buildings with four or more units that have a certain level of unpaid tax liens, unresolved violations or that have affordability requirements expiring within the next two years.\nThe amended bill tweaked some of these qualifications.\nThe bill would no longer apply to buildings that had affordability requirements expire in the past two years, nor to those with unpaid municipal charges totaling $1,500 or more per unit, as was the case in the bill introduced\nlast week\n.\nBuildings enrolled in the city\u2019s alternative enforcement program would still be subject to COPA, but this requirement would kick in if the building has been part of the program for at least a year. The new version also no longer includes vacant properties zoned for housing.\nThe bill still applies to buildings that were denied a certification of no harassment from the city (a process where owners must demonstrate to the city that they haven\u2019t harassed their tenants) within the past year.\nThe measure further limits the exclusivity window for these deals. After receiving notice of an owner\u2019s intent to sell, nonprofits and qualifying joint ventures (dubbed qualified entities) have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property.\nOnce that time runs out, the qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. The previous version of the bill created a 135-day window, while the latest measure calls for 105 days. As was the case previously, qualified entities have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nThese changes are not likely to assuage the bill\u2019s fiercest critics, who objected to the idea of having HPD act as a middleman in these deals. Landlords and brokers\nargued\nthat the measure will disrupt the residential market and scare away would-be investors, while proponents see COPA as leveling the playing field for nonprofits and community land trusts.\nMore controversial bills\nPro-housing groups are particularly concerned that the Council will pass a package of bills that would add new restrictions to city-funded housing.\nIn a letter sent to the Council last week, the New York Housing Conference and other groups urged against the passage of five measures that, together, they estimated would increase the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budgetary needs by $1.3 billion.\nOne of the\nbills\nrequires that, of the housing units built or preserved using city funding, at least 50 percent must be affordable for extremely and very low-income households, and at least 30 percent for very low-income households (both are\nfederally defined\nterms). The latest iteration limits the universe of buildings that would count toward that overall percentage, excluding buildings with fewer than 75 units.\nAnother would set minimum percentages for the amount of city-funded units that have two- to three-bedrooms. An amended version of the bill adds a number of carveouts to the pool of projects that would count toward those overall percentages, excluding projects where at least 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, that have fewer than 20 units, where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date.\nUnder the bill, starting July 1, 2027, HPD must ensure that, over a five-year period, at least 25 percent of the dwelling units financed by the city are two-bedroom units and at least 15 percent have three bedrooms or more. The amended bill also specifies that HPD can adjust these percentages if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nEmily Eisner, an economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute who is also on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing transition committee, warned in a report released Thursday that applying these rules to city-funded special needs and supportive housing would lead to fewer units being built for these vulnerable populations (larger units are more expensive to build).\nIn an interview, she said that while the changes to limit the scope of these measures were welcome, the newer versions of the bills still don\u2019t address the time and cost of adding new restrictions.\n\u201cLegislating these size requirements puts major new requirements into HPD\u2019s funding pipeline, which will slow the development of affordable housing units,\u201d she said.\nThrough a spokesperson, Council leadership pushed back on this criticism.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s public dollars should be used to support the development of affordable housing that best meets New Yorkers\u2019 affordability needs,\u201d a City Council spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cThese bills prioritize a use of public dollars for maximum affordability and serving the needs of families and residents with the greatest housing needs, rather than to just build a higher number of less affordable apartments that fail to serve them.\u201d\nAnother bill would set a minimum percentage of city-funded homeownership units, but a separate measure that would limit the percentage of city-funded studio apartments in senior housing projects did not make the aging list.\nThe union-backed Construction Justice Act, which would set $40 per hour minimum wages and benefits for construction workers on housing projects that are funded by $1.5 million or more in city financing, also advanced Wednesday. The New York Housing Conference has estimated that the measure would add $750 million to HPD\u2019s production costs, a figure supporters have disputed.\nAfter expressing disappointment about a previous version of the bill that carved out certain affordable housing projects, the Mason Tenders\u2019 District Council said Thursday that it is satisfied with where the measure landed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been proud to champion this effort from the start and believe the CJA will help deliver our city\u2019s construction workforce the standards they deserve,\u201d David Bolger, business manager for the district council, said in a statement. \u201cPassing it would be a monumental achievement for this Council.\u201d\n",

The new version specifies that rent-regulated tenants must consent to improvements to comply with the law and the charges associated with it (as permitted by state law, which only allows the landlord to recoup a portion of the cost of individual apartment improvements through rent increases). This is a win for rent-stabilized owners.\nHPD termsheet bills:\nMinimum percentage of two- and three-unit apartments funded by city\n\u2014\nCarves out projects where 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, those that have fewer than 20 units, projects where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date.\n\u2014 Specifies that HPD can adjust these percentages if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nMinimum affordability for city-funded housing units\n\u2014\u00a0Limits the universe of buildings that would count toward that overall percentage, excluding buildings with fewer than 75 units and those that have secured key approvals by certain dates.\nMinimum homeownership units in city-funded projects:\nNo amended version posted yet.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: If you read the above and thought, \u201cHey, she forgot about this change!\u201d or \u201cActually, I have no fear of that passing because I think this bill won\u2019t pass or even come to a vote because I know something,\u201d please send details to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n. This was my first crack at these bills, some of which weren\u2019t posted until late Thursday.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Newark International Airport was built in 1928 on 68 acres of marshland, which was filled in with things you would expect, like mud dredged from Newark Bay and dry dirt, as well as some more surprising items, like 7,000 discarded Christmas trees and 200 bank safes donated by a junk dealer, according to the 2009 book \u201cNewark Airport,\u201d by Henry Holden. (H/T to my husband, who passed along this tidbit.)\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul has more than 150 bills waiting on her desk,\nGothamist reports\n. One of those bills would increase cameras and oversight at the state\u2019s prisons, and another would add safety requirements to artificial intelligence models. President Donald Trump has pledged to preempt states from passing such measures.\n\u2014 Soon after his win in November, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani tried to pump the brakes on the race for the next City Council speaker by asking unions, party leaders and individual Council members to hold off on endorsing a candidate,\nPolitico New York reports\n. He and his team then tried to figure out how to influence the competition, but Politico reports that these efforts came too late. Council member Julie Menin declared victory in late November.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$12.5 million\nfor a 3,541-square-foot condominium at 11 North Moore Street in Tribeca.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7 million\nfor a\n6,750-square-foot multi-family townhouse at 198 Sixth Avenue in Soho. Paul Murphy and Edward Svec with Compass\nhad the listing\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16 million\nfor a 4,400-square-foot condominium at 92 Laight Street in Tribeca. The Leonard Steinberg Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new project filing for 6 individual new building permits for a total of 360 affordable units in East New York. Permits were filed by Michael Gelfand, AIA, on behalf of Rona Reodica, Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Building and Land Development Services.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission approved a Watson Island land sale that will allow the Motwani family\u2019s Merrimac Ventures and BH3 to develop a plot on the southwest side of the island into a mixed-use project with a condo component.\nThe proposal drew criticism from residents, who called it a \u201cbad deal\u201d and urged commissioners not to rush the vote.\n\u201cResidents have sued the city because of the issue with Watson Island before, and have taken a vote to ensure the sale of Watson Island is of fair market value,\u201d Miami resident Gilbert Palacios said. \u201cWe can use responsible and good development in our city like we have done in the past. \u2026 This is a bad deal for the city, a bad deal for residents, a bad deal for workers.\u201d\nCommissioner Ralph Rosado was the sole no vote. Rosado wanted the city to hire Cushman &amp; Wakefield to complete an independent appraisal of the property.\n\u201cAt this time, I would like to be confident that we\u2019ve negotiated the best possible deal for the city, and I\u2019m not there at the moment,\u201d Rosado said. \u201cI do think that there is room to make this a better deal that\u2019s more responsive to our residents and our taxpayers. \u2026 Not only do I think that there\u2019s room for additional public benefits, but I have concerns about the fact that the purchaser could, in fact \u2026 turn around and flip the property, and that has major consequences.\u201d\nBut Rosado\u2019s motion failed to pass, and instead commissioners approved the sale resolution. The commission had deferred taking action, most recently at a November meeting.\nThe controversy stems from an appraisal that found the land could be worth between $257 million and $342 million, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. But the developers say that the existing long-term lease devalues the land.\nIt\u2019s been\nmore than a year since\n64 percent of Miami voters approved the sale of about 3.2 acres at 888 MacArthur Causeway to IG Luxury, the BH3-Merrimac venture.\nThe price of the land is now pegged at $29 million. As part of the deal, the developers will provide $9 million that\u2019s to be used for affordable housing and infrastructure improvements. The city will also negotiate the release of deed restrictions on the land with the state for $4 million. (Voters also approved a referendum to sell land on the east side of the island\nto Terra and ESJ\nCapital Partners.)\nThe change will allow the developers to build about 100 condos instead of previously approved timeshare units. The developers will continue to lease the remaining 7-plus acres of land that the city is retaining ownership of.\nBH3 and Merrimac formed a joint venture in 2023 to\ntake over the lease\nfrom the former developer, Mehmet Bayraktar\u2019s Flagstone Property Group. Flagstone was tangled in years of delays and litigation with the city of Miami. Voters approved Bayraktar\u2019s deal via a referendum in 2001, but his firm only completed a portion of the then-planned project.\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, commissioners deferred a final vote on\na proposal that would allow\ndevelopers to double their density in specific neighborhoods, starting with Edgewater.\n",

Renderings depict a walkable layout with restaurants, entertainment venues and retail connected by meandering paths with parking integrated close to activity areas.\nThe lawn is designed to host concerts, seasonal markets, games or even ice skating in winter, aiming to capture the nostalgia of the Stratford Square Mall but in a contemporary format.\nCoStar News reported\nthe whole center will have more than 400,000 square feet and will take five to seven years for construction.\nThe Grove at Bloomingdale signed its first tenant.\nHB Investments, led by CEO Bill Gust, will operate a 100,000-square-foot indoor sports complex called Bloomingdale Yard, built on the model of the company\u2019s other operations at Naperville Yard and Milwaukee Yard. The complex, slated to open in 2027 near a free-standing Kohl\u2019s, will offer indoor fields, childcare, youth programs and adult recreation. Gust said he had eyed the location for years.\nThe Daily Herald also reported regional restaurateurs are looking at the venue, and an unnamed developer may build a 280-unit apartment complex as part of the project.\nAs for financing, the village is preparing to sell $52 million in bonds to fund infrastructure improvements, including the lake and public spaces set to break ground next year.\nBloomingdale Village President\nFranco Coladipietro\nsaid the project will try to replace the old mall concept with an \u201cexperience-first\u201d appeal in the context of the\nBloomingdale retail market\n.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "For sellers of condos in downtown Chicago, success may be based on how much of a loss they can stomach.\nLuxury condos have been slow movers over the last few years, as the\nmarket slipped\nand money moved to the suburbs and the North Side neighborhoods. Sellers have had to make deep cuts to find buyers,\nsometimes slashing millions\nfrom their asking price and\nselling for less than they paid\nyears ago.\nMany luxury condos still on the market have made similar price chops: The price for a 63rd floor penthouse at\n800 North Michigan Avenue\nhas dropped by $8 million since it was first shopped around privately in 2022. A\n31st-floor condo\nat the Palmolive building has had its asking price reduced by close to $5 million in the five years that it\u2019s been on the market.\nSome sellers resisted lowering their prices over the last few years, hoping the market would recover, said Compass agent Jeff Lowe. But more sellers are starting to cut their expectations and lower their asking prices, and buyers are starting to come to the table.\n\u201cSellers are definitely taking it on the chin, but at least if they\u2019re willing to take it on the chin there are buyers,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI would say three or four years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nStill, other sellers are often slow to accept the realities of the market and take a loss on their sale.\n\u201cSometimes because the owners paid so much money pre-Covid, they\u2019re having a difficulty taking a loss of a million or two million,\u201d said Chezi Rafaeli, a Coldwell Banker Realty agent who specializes in downtown condos.\nRafaeli has a listing on the 86th floor of Trump Tower at 401 North Wabash Avenue that\u2019s asking $6 million, a $2 million drop from its asking price in 2021. The seller received a recent offer close to the asking price, he said, but they are holding out in the hopes of a market recovery.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the properties that have had the biggest drops in asking price since they were listed.\n800 North Michigan Avenue\nOf the condos currently listed above $4 million downtown, the biggest price drop has been at Bob Levy\u2019s 63rd-floor penthouse at 800 North Michigan Avenue.\nThe former Art Institute of Chicago chair is currently asking nearly $7 million for the Park Tower unit, according to listing services. That\u2019s less than half the original asking price when the condo was first shopped on a private agents\u2019 network for $15 million.\nIt was listed publicly for $13.5 million in July 2022, and by September 2024 the price had been knocked down to $9 million, based on listing data. In January, the asking price dropped to $7.7 million and fell to just under $7 million in July. Levy paid $3.5 million for the penthouse in 2000, according to property records.\nLowe, the listing agent for the condo, said he thinks the current price is attractive. He expects it to sell early next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re priced to sell there as soon as we find somebody that\u2019s ready for a full floor in that building,\u201d Lowe said.\nCitadel founder Ken Griffin\nfound a buyer this month\nfor his penthouse at the building, with a $12.5 million asking price. The final asking price was more than $3 million less than he first asked for the unit, but a good sign for the market that has rarely seen eight-figure deals in the last three years.\nAlso at 800 North Michigan, listing services show unit 3501 has cut its asking price by $1.35 million, from an initial $5.65 million, since it was listed in January 2024. Its most recent asking price, at $4.3 million, was set in September.\n159 East Walton Place\nTwo for-sale units with the biggest price chops are at the Palmolive Building at 159 East Walton Place. A condo owned by Chicago financier David Herro has been on the market since 2020, when it first asked for $10.9 million, based on listing data. The 5,500-square-foot unit now is asking just under $6 million. That would be a loss for Herro, who bought the condo in 2013 for $6.75 million, property records show.\nAnother condo, owned by former Navteq CEO Judson Green, is asking $4.25 million. It\u2019s a nearly 5,000-square-foot unit on the building\u2019s 18th floor. The current price, set in August, is a 42 percent drop from its initial asking price of $7.35 million in February 2020, according to listing services. Green bought the condo for $6.3 million in 2007, property records show.\nAlso at the building, a duplex covering the top two floors \u2014 once owned by Vince Vaughn \u2014 has had $3 million cut off its asking price from 2021. The 7,900-square-foot penthouse was listed for $11.9 million and is now asking $8.9 million, according to listing services.\nThe Palmolive Building, built in 1929, has been particularly hit by dropping values over the last few years, Rafaeli said. The building lacks the new amenities that luxury buyers are after, and it has seen property taxes rise because of recent special assessments.\n\u201cToday it all comes down to amenities,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are more attracted to amenities versus just living in a condo with a doorman.\u201d\n",

The development corporation wants to begin pursuing bigger projects in the next two years, though it will need much more money.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re talking about a generational moment that will require hundreds of millions of dollars to build large-scale public parks [and] mixed-use development[s] \u2014 projects that fuel the economic recovery, deliver additional revenue to the city\u2019s general fund and ultimately make San Francisco, particularly downtown, a place where businesses want to invest, stay and bring their employees,\u201d\nShola Olatoye\n, CEO of the Downtown Development Corporation, said.\nThe $60 million funding commitment, announced on Tuesday, comes from a group of nearly 50 entities, including real estate developers Emerald Fund, Fifth Space,\nPresidio Bay\nand\nTMG Partners\n, as well as high-profile companies operating in the city like OpenAI, Google, Salesforce and Amazon.\nThe money will be used in DDC\u2019s ongoing\nefforts to revitalize downtown\n, funding things like enhanced lighting and security cameras, recruiting efforts to hire more police officers in the city, a new downtown business fund to help fill vacancies along the city\u2019s\nkey retail corridors\n, a new park in Embarcadero Plaza, improvements to the East Cut Crossing and investment in public art.\nBanking giants J.P.

        "content": "In breadth and name, a developer\u2019s early vision for a pair of downtown\nSan Jose\nblocks reflected the ambition and optimism that coursed through the neighborhood just a few years ago.\nProposed in 2021, amid the settling haze of the pandemic,\nUrban Catalyst\u2019s\n\u201cIcon\u201d would feature more than half-a-million square feet of office space, held within a modern-looking 21 stories of glass and steel. Then, in 2023, after the project had already been approved, the developer floated a pivot away from office, suggesting the tower could instead hold 650 housing units.\nDirectly across East Santa Clara Street, the developer\u2019s \u201cEcho\u201d proposal was set to be a multifamily tower of a similar aesthetic, reaching 27 stories with 415 residences.\nDriven in part by a creeping acceptance that not enough workers are returning to the office, that sense of trajectory for Silicon Valley\u2019s central business district has since dwindled. So, too, has the willingness of the capital markets to take ambitious bets on the neighborhood.\nNow, Urban Catalyst\u2019s plans to add to the city skyline have been condensed into a pair of eight-story, mixed-use buildings, according to permit applications filed with the city of San Jose\u2019s planning department last week. The buildings will include 626 units and ground-floor commercial space.\nUrban Catalyst COO Joshua Burroughs blamed the change primarily on macroeconomic factors, from the cost of construction and tariffs, to conservative capital markets. Still, he has maintained a positive tone behind the estimated $300 million housing project, emphasizing that the revamped Icon and Echo will provide downtown San Jose with housing, a crucial element for the resilient, 20-hour neighborhood city leaders are trying to create.\nHowever, some see the contracted vision as a broader recognition of, and perhaps resignation to, the city\u2019s track since the pandemic.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 600 units downtown, but to go from 20 stories to eight is uninspiring,\u201d a local economic development analyst told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe analyst, who was not authorized to speak publicly, has tracked downtown developments for a decade. Although it\u2019s common for ambitious early renderings to materialize into something more mild, Urban Catalyst has been among the rare local developers to get cranes in the sky, which adds to the \u201cdisheartening\u201d signals sent by the project\u2019s downsizing, he said.\nFifty miles to the north, downtown San Francisco has enjoyed a return of office workers and\nincreased demand for space,\nparticularly high-class, quality offices. While commercial leasing has surged in the broader Silicon Valley, workers have not returned to downtown San Jose at the same pace, one city hall staffer told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve peaked in terms of office space,\u201d the staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to get more people downtown is by building housing.\u201d\nSome of downtown San Jose\u2019s office ills can be placed on the nature of Silicon Valley, where startups can quickly grow from a garage into multi-million-dollar valuations. Because of that, Burroughs said \u201cone unique thing about Silicon Valley\u201d is that about 90 percent of the office space here is built speculatively, with no specific tenant in mind.\n\u201cStart-ups get funding, and suddenly they need 500,000 square feet of office space in a month, so you need a certain supply of office space sitting there, given the velocity at which these companies grow,\u201d Burroughs said. \u201cThat means you\u2019re speculatively building and needing to find investors who are comfortable with that approach.\u201d\nOne recent example is\nJay Paul Company\u2019s 200 Park\n. The 19-story, 1 million-square-foot development has sat vacant since its completion in 2023.\u201d.\nThen there is Google\u2019s\nstalled gigaproject, Downtown West\n. Approved in 2021, the tech titan envisioned bringing 4,000 homes, 7.3 million square feet of office space, and an estimated economic impact of $19 billion with its new neighborhood. However, the project hasn\u2019t moved since approval.\nLocals see both projects as tea leaves for when downtown San Jose\u2019s office market rises out of its prolonged distress.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not no hope,\u201d the city hall staffer said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fill 200 Park, and we can\u2019t get the Google project going, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the office market move.\u201d\n",

        "content": "SLS Properties is relaunching the I.M. Pei-designed office building at 2425 West Loop South in Houston, aiming to move past years of turmoil under former owner Ali Choudhri.\nThe vacant 285,00-square-foot 11-story building, formerly home to Stage Stores\u2019 headquarters, became mired in legal and financial distress, including attempted foreclosure and an involuntary bankruptcy tied to Choudhri\u2019s Jetall Companies,\nBisNow reported\n. National Bank of Kuwait, which lent $60.2 million\non the building\nin 2018, remains a creditor in the bankruptcy case, and Choudhri was\nbriefly jailed\nin April for contempt after failing to submit required financial documents.\nAfter acquiring the building through a receivership sale, Houston-based SLS Properties opted to reject all prior leases through bankruptcy proceedings, choosing instead to completely revamp the property.\nSLS Properties founder Danny Sheena said the building was in severe disrepair upon takeover \u2014 only one elevator functioned, the cooling system and roof had failed, garage lighting was outdated and interior floors needed structural attention. SLS has since modernized elevators, replaced mechanical systems and the roof, upgraded lighting and restored interior spaces.\nThe building is now intentionally 100 percent empty and ready for immediate tenant occupancy.\nTranswestern\u2019s Kelli Gault, Jack Scharnberg and Doug Little will handle leasing. Gault emphasized the rarity of such large, contiguous blocks of space in Houston\u2019s Galleria submarket. With expansive floor plates, opportunities for prominent signage and its site directly across from The Galleria Mall, the property could appeal to tenants seeking high visibility.\nIts architectural pedigree also enhances its appeal \u2013 few office buildings can claim the same designer as the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, Gault said.\nSheena said nearby investments could impact the building\u2019s future. It sits next to land purchased by billionaire Tilman Fertitta, who also owns the River Oaks District development across the street and is\nexploring expansion concepts\n. Fertitta recently stepped down as CEO of his holding company to serve as\nU.S. ambassador to Italy\n. The property also neighbors The Greenleigh, a Marriott-affiliated hotel rising from the former Hotel Derek site.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Those owners now either have to find new operators for their properties or sell them off. That\u2019s easier said than done, as they\u2019ll be harder to backfill than they were three to four years ago, when many property owners signed leases with Sonder, as the hotel market in Los Angeles remains depressed.\n\u201cFrom a buyer standpoint, this is going to be a good opportunity,\u201d Alan Reay, president of Los Angeles-based Atlas Hospitality Group, told Bisnow. \u201cFrom an owner-slash-seller standpoint, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult.\u201d\nLos Angeles landlords\nthat were operating Sonder locations this year claim in pending lawsuits that Sonder owes them a sum of more than $18.9 million in unpaid rent and other fees, according to court records cited by Bisnow. Similar suits have been filed in New York after Sonder\u2019s abrupt shutdown and subsequent eviction of tenants from their living quarters.\nSonder\n\u2019s high lease rates will be difficult to match for any potential new operators. \u201cFirst and foremost, they\u2019re not going to find anyone to replicate the income that was promised to them by Sonder, which is why Sonder collapsed, right?\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s WeWork applied to the hotel industry.\u201d\nFor owners thinking of pivoting out of hospitality, multifamily conversions could be possible, though they might only offer theoretical relief. Sonder units typically lack kitchens, and in Los Angeles, building out residential infrastructure is costly and slow.\nSelling also could be an issue thanks to the\noften reviled Measure ULA\ntransfer tax affecting any deals above $5 million.\n\u201cI have a vacant hotel where the only operating history could be years old, from before Sonder,\u201d Rod Apodaca, president of RJA Hotels, said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to rely on that, and they\u2019re going to want some type of discount if they\u2019re going to buy a property based on a future income stream that is untested.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles hotel market is struggling as international travelers \u2014 usually a significant portion of L.A.\u2019s hotel guests \u2014 are visiting in lower numbers, per Bisnow. Still,\u00a0 some hotel management companies have started to swoop in on former Sonder properties and offer their operating experience, Reay said.\nSonder remains in the midst of\nChapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings\n, which has stymied the lawsuits it faces from landlords across the country.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Chelsea Piers, Life Time and Equinox all gobbled up tens of thousands of square feet for Big Apple expansions. They were joined by another wellness player, Neko Health.\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast from last year\u2019s rankings, when not one wellness location cracked the top ten retail leases. But big, luxury health clubs are making a bet that Manhattanites will pay top dollar for resort-like amenities and whole-body services, like massage therapy, nutrition coaching and so-called metabolic assessments.\nThat explosion has been accompanied by other retail wellness booms, like the\nspate of sauna concepts\nopening doors downtown.\n\u201cWe\u2019re much beyond the typical fitness club where you run on a treadmill or lift some weights,\u201d Keith DeCoster, vice president of market data and policy at the Real Estate Board of New York, told\nTRD\nearlier this year.\nHere are Manhattan\u2019s top retail leases of 2025, ranked by square footage. All data is current through November.\nMeow Wolf | South Street Seaport | 75,000 sq feet\nMeow Wolf is an art company focused on interactive and immersive exhibits. Seaport Entertainment Group announced in March that\nMeow Wolf will open\nits seventh permanent exhibition \u2014 first on the East Coast \u2014 on several floors of Pier 17, technically 89 South Street.\nCBRE was the dual leasing agent. Mary Ann Tighe, Gerry Miovski and Evan Haskel represented the landlord, while Cassie Durand, Sacha Zarba and Aylin Gucalp represented the tenant.\nOld Navy | Garment District | 55,000 sq feet\nOld Navy has been on the move. The Gap-owned apparel brand announced its exit from its flagship space at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s 150 West 34th Street last year, leaving the Herald Square lot open for Primark to swoop in on the biggest lease of 2024. This year, however, Old Navy\ninked a 15-year lease\nat JEMB Realty\u2019s Herald Towers, at 50 West 34th Street.\nGap Inc.\u2019s real estate team and Newmark\u2019s Ariel Schuster represented Old Navy in the deal. JEMB subsidiary LMJ Realty represented the landlord in-house.\nLife Time | Grand Central | 52,000 sq feet\nLife Time signed a 20-year lease\nat PBC\u2019s 10 Bryant Park. The space will include \u201cco-ed wet suite, a steam room, a sauna, a cold-plunge pool, fitness studios, training spaces, spas, a coworking space and a library,\u201d\nTRD\nreported earlier this year.\nAtlantic Retail\u2019s Joe Mastromonaco brokered the deal on behalf of the tenant. JLL brokers Patrick Smith and Paul Glickman represented the landlord.\nEquinox | Chelsea | 50,000 sq feet\nKeeping up with the competition, Equinox, an OG luxury New York gym, signed a long-term lease across\nthree floors of Terminal Warehouse\n, at 261 11th Avenue. It was among the first tenants at the redeveloped 19th-century warehouse, which is being converted to office and retail space by L&amp;L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust. L&amp;L purchased the 12-story building with a company since acquired by Columbia in 2018 for $880 million.\nNewmark\u2019s Jeff Roseman represented Equinox. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team including Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran represented the landlord.\nConvene Hospitality | Chelsea | 50,000 sq feet\nAlso in Terminal Warehouse, Convene Hospitality Group\nsigned a deal for 50,000 square feet\nfrom L&amp;L and Columbia. The group is planning to open an event space called The Mallory on the same three floors as Equinox, although in a different section of the historic building.\nCBRE\u2019s Rocco Laginestra represented CHG. The same Cushman &amp; Wakefield team as above,\u00a0 Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran, represented the landlord.\nChelsea Piers | Hudson Square | 48,833 sq feet\nChelsea Piers Management, once a creative re-use of industrial waterfront space, is expanding its profile as a premier fitness location. Expansion is part of this push. In its biggest of two leases signed this year, the company plans to take 48,833 square feet at the base of\nGFP Real Estate\u2019s 200 Varick Street\n. The deal was reported in CBRE\u2019s third-quarter retail report but brokerage details were not disclosed.\nChelsea Piers | Billionaire\u2019s Row | 47,000 sq feet\nChelsea Piers Management\u2019s second-biggest lease of the year was at the ground floor of 135 East 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row. TF Cornerstone, the landlord, is planning to redevelop the 32-story office tower into a 350-unit residential building.\nThe story was\nfirst reported\nby the New York Post and brokerage details were not disclosed.\nOld Navy | Chelsea | 45,000 sq feet\nOld Navy renewed its lease at 610 Sixth Avenue this year, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s first-quarter report. The store there has been open since at least 1997, according to WWD.\nThe building is owned by a trust connected to the family of Sol Goldman, according to city records.\nNeko Health | Upper West Side | 42,151 sq feet\nNeko Health is planning for 42,000 square feet at 15 Central Park West. The lease was disclosed in Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s third-quarter Manhattan retail report. The company, which offers full-body health scans, was started by Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek. 15 Central Park West is a 35-story condo building developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf.\nNeither Neko Health nor the brokerage team at 15 Central Park West immediately responded to a request for comment.\nAritzia | Soho | 30,000 sq feet\nCanadian clothier Aritzia extended its lease at 560 Broadway, with GFP Real Estate, the Commercial Observer reported. The womenswear company signed its original lease in the former Dean &amp; Deluca\u2019s spot in 2020, initially using it as a pop-up.\nNeith Stone, Donna Vogel and Jeffrey Gural represented GFP in-house, the Observer reported. Ariel Schuster and Jason Wecker brokered the deal for Aritzia.\n",

        "content": "During the height of Miami\u2019s high season, between November and January, folks line up around the block outside Zak the Baker to pick up loaves of freshly baked sourdough bread or to sit down for a cup of coffee.\nBut for the seven other months of the year, on any given weekday, \u201cyou can stand outside and not see a single person walk by for 20 minutes,\u201d Zak Stern, owner of the 11-year-old bakery in\nWynwood\n, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cIt can be extremely quiet in the off season,\u201d Stern said. \u201cAnd then we have peaks when we are\u00a0 very busy like during\nArt Basel\nor the holidays. But there\u2019s no consistent, all day flow of people.\u201d\nThe inconsistency in foot traffic fuels Stern\u2019s belief that asking retail rents on Wynwood\u2019s most popular streets, where landlords are seeking $100 or more a square foot, are not justified, and are pricing out homegrown tenants.\n\u201cThe foot traffic needs to be reliable,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThere needs to be morning commuters, lunchtime crowds, afternoon shoppers, early evening diners and weekenders. You can\u2019t [rely on paying] your rent during the peaks. It\u2019s going to take some time, and it\u2019s going to take some work.\u201d\nStern recalled when Wynwood felt like it was on an upward trajectory, with buses of tourists shuttled from Miami Beach and year\u2011over\u2011year momentum for the arts-and-food scene. In his view, that climb stalled because the basics never got built: tree canopy, shade, plazas and calmer streets that make walking appealing in Miami\u2019s heat.\nNewly built mixed-use projects with ground-floor retail spaces sparked a spike in Wynwood\u2019s retail and restaurant rents, but small business owners like Stern say the neighborhood\u2019s uneven, event\u2011driven foot traffic and harsh pedestrian environment make paying triple digits hard to pencil out. Yet, landlords and brokers don\u2019t want to hear it. They argue that surging visitor counts, record condo pricing and limited walkable districts in Miami justify today\u2019s rents.\u200b\nLast year, J. Wakefield Brewing, a craft beer joint that had been in Wynwood for a decade, closed shop. Owner Jonathan Wakefield told\nEater\nat the time that \u201crising rents, coupled with reduced foot traffic and street closures due to construction, made it nearly impossible\u201d to stay in business. Another longtime watering hole casualty of rising rents: Brick, an outdoor venue that opened in 2013, shuttered in November.\nYet, commercial property owners say Wynwood rents are where they\u2019re supposed to be.\n\u201cI think rents are predominantly in line with any other Miami walkable neighborhood,\u201d said\nAlex Karakhanian\n, a landlord for a handful of Wynwood projects. Wynwood gets 6 to 9 million visitors a year, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a ton of people from all over the place coming to Wynwood \u2026 I go to Zak the Baker at least once a week, and I\u2019ve never gotten a table without having to wait on a normal work day.\u201d\nFrom $20 to $100 a foot in a decade\nStern\u2019s bakery is insulated by a legacy lease that\u2019s below the $100 per-square-foot mark, which is the only reason his business can still operate in Wynwood\u2019s current market conditions, he said. Over the past 10 years, pricing for neighboring storefronts shot up from the $20s a square foot to $100\u2011plus per square foot on prime blocks, Stern said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got another seven, eight years left [on the lease],\u201d Stern said. \u201cBut in order for an independent, local craftsman like myself to succeed, [landlords are] going to need to be much more reasonable than $100 a square foot. It\u2019s just that the barrier to entry is too tall.\u201d\nThe\nWynwood\nretail market, including less desirable streets, is more expensive than the overall Miami retail market, data show. Between 2023 and 2025, the average asking rent for retail and restaurants is between the high $60s to low $80s per square foot compared to low-to-mid $50s per square foot citywide, according to CoStar.\nVacancies are rising.\nIn the third quarter, the vacancy rate in the Wynwood/Design District submarket hit 9.7 percent compared to 3.2 percent for Miami-Dade County overall, according to a Colliers report. During the same period last year, Miami-Dade\u2019s vacancy rate was 2.8 percent compared to 6.5 percent for the Wynwood/Design District submarket.\nMetro 1\u2019s Andres Nava agreed that certain Wynwood corridors have blasted past $100 a square foot, but stressed \u201cthat\u2019s not the entire neighborhood.\u201d For instance, a fitness tenant typically tops out at about $70 to $80 per square foot, triple\u2011net, for a roughly 2,000\u2011square\u2011foot space. Food and beverage operators, depending on whether they can serve liquor, tend to land in the $60- to $70\u2011per\u2011square\u2011foot range, Nava said.\n\u201cFoot traffic is obviously mostly on Northwest Second Avenue and Northwest Third Avenue,\u201d Nava said. \u201cThose are the two main pedestrian corridors. When you start going to the residential projects that don\u2019t attract as much foot traffic, you see rents that are more sustainable.\u201d\nSome developers recognize this reality, Nava said. For instance, he recently brokered leases for Hot Body Pilates and coffee bar Chrome Cafe at Amara Wynwood, a mixed-use project at 45 Northeast 27th Street developed by Chicago-based\nFitfield Companies\n.\n\u201cThe rents need to be a lot more palatable and attainable to create a sustainable future for Wynwood,\u201d Nava said. \u201cSome developers like Fitfield will be more lenient on reducing the rent to get the right operators in the neighborhood.\u201d\nThe foot traffic flipside\nWhen Wynwood\u2019s early pioneers were buying warehouses to redevelop a decade ago, the neighborhood was drawing fewer than 50,000 visitors a year, Karakhanian said. In his view, the same way rents were $15 to $20 per square foot back when there was \u201cno foot traffic,\u201d the combination of millions of visitors and a limited supply of walkable streets now supports today\u2019s rent growth.\nKarakhanian noted that some Wynwood retailers, restaurateurs and bar owners are racking up north of $10 million in annual sales.\n\u201cRecently, one of our tenants bought the space they were leasing for $140 a square foot, triple net. They did the math on their expenses and decided to purchase the space for close to $2,800 a square foot,\u201d he said.\nKarakhanian\u2019s Miami-based Lndmrk Development, Scott Sherman\u2019s Miami-based Torose Equities and Michael Simkins\u2019 Miami Beach-based Lion Development Group sold a retail condo at\nSociety Wynwood\nfor $3.7 million to the owners of I Scream Gelato. When the sale closed, he was approached by other tenants throughout Lndmrk\u2019s Wynwood portfolio about possibly buying their spaces, Karakhanian said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a one-off scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a tenant is approaching you to buy their space, it is very hard for me to believe that a tenant is doing poorly.\u201d\nSome leasing brokers say the foot traffic in Wynwood makes it a better value than other walkable commercial districts in Miami. The neighborhood has \u201c10 times\u201d the foot traffic than Brickell, Coconut Grove, the Design District, Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road and Giralda Avenue in Gables, Tony Arellano with Dwntwn Realty Advisors told\nTRD\n.\nAverage asking rents in Coconut Grove are 10 to 15 percent higher, 30 percent higher in Lincoln Road and five times more in the Design District compared to Wynwood, Arellano added.\n\u201cWhoever claims that Wynwood rents don\u2019t match the foot traffic, let\u2019s do the comparison,\u201d Arellano said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find Wynwood is still a very good value.\u201d\nThe view from the ground\nOn the ground, however, even successful operators are hitting a wall. Gramps, one of Wynwood\u2019s early and best\u2011known bars, is closing in January after more than a decade in the neighborhood. Pizza Tropical, an Italian pie joint within Gramps, shut down this week. Owner\nAdam Gersten\ntold\nTRD\n\u201cit\u2019s not just the rent.\u201d But his decision also reflects seven days a week of wear and tear, mounting repair bills and the cost of upgrading a space that has seen heavy use.\n\u201cHaving to pay a little more [rent] is not the end of the world because, thankfully, people still go there,\u201d Gersten said. \u201cWe got all these people moving into the neighborhood. But they\u2019re Ubering to one place, staying there and then leaving. They\u2019re not necessarily bar hopping.\u201d\nGersten traces part of the pressure to landlords who acquired buildings at aggressive prices and now must start rent at $75 a square foot, then layer on passthrough expenses such as maintenance and property taxes.\n\u201cI used to think paying $40 square foot in rent was a good number because you can make money,\u201d Gersten said. \u201cWith triple net, today you\u2019re looking at paying in the $80s, $90s and $100s.\u00a0 When you have a sizable space that needs to make money, you are just churning tenants.\u201d\nFor Stern, developers and brokers who insist Wynwood\u2019s foot traffic is doing well are refusing to see reality.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re dreaming,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re comparing it to some of these peaks that we have, sure. But [to achieve] that every day, all day consistency, we\u2019ve got to remain humble and honest about who we are.\u201d",

        "content": "Blackstone locked in a ten-figure loan to refinance its largest rental property in New York City.\nWells Fargo provided $3.15 billion in debt to refinance Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A $3 billion debt from Fannie Mae backing Manhattan\u2019s largest apartment complex was nearing maturity.\nSince purchasing the complex alongside a Canadian pension fund for $5.5 billion in 2015, Blackstone has invested $460 million into the property. That includes renovations, expansions and the installation of 9,600 solar panels. Blackstone also added a Whole Foods and a restaurant to the retail portfolio.\nNotably, all of the units in Stuy Town are rent-stabilized. At the time of its acquisition, Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s firm planned to lift more than half of the complex\u2019s 11,200 apartments out of stabilization in a deal brokered by the city.\nStuy Town\u2019s apartments were slated to become unstabilized by June 2020, but tenants sued Blackstone under the protections afforded to them by changes made to the rent laws the prior year.\nIn early 2023, a state court judge\nruled in favor of the complex\u2019s tenants\n, saying the changes in the rent law meant Blackstone couldn\u2019t deregulate roughly 6,200 apartments in a decision with major\nimplications\nfor other properties that received J-51 tax benefits.\nBlackstone appealed the ruling, but ultimately\nended its attempts\nto challenge a decision on the status of the portfolio last winter.\nBlackstone has been busy in the Big Apple lately. Last week, a joint venture between TPG and Acadia Realty Trust agreed to purchase The Shops at Skyview in Flushing from Blackstone for\nroughly $425 million\n. The shopping center at 40-24 College Point Boulevard is anchored by a grocery store, spans 550,000 square feet and is almost fully leased.\nOutside of city limits, Blackstone is nearing the acquisition of the 277-room Four Seasons hotel in downtown San Francisco for\napproximately $130 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "The legal battle between the University of California, Los Angeles, the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company continues as the school mulls potentially abandoning its lease to play football at the\nRose Bowl\n. The school is\nreportedly\nlooking to decamp to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood to take advantage of its proximity to the university campus as well as increased revenue generation opportunities with more premium seating and luxury suites.\nNeither the Rose Bowl Operating Company nor the City of Pasadena violated the Rose Bowl\u2019s long-term lease agreement before the university began considering a move to SoFi Stadium earlier this year, Pasadena Now\nreported\n, citing a new document filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\nUCLA\n\u2019s lease states that the school can abandon its agreement early only in the case of a \u201cgame-threatening default,\u201d or an immediate issue that would keep the team from playing at the stadium, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Under its current lease, the UCLA Bruins cannot play its home football games in another stadium in Los Angeles or Orange Counties through June 2044,\naccording\nto the New York Times.\nThe\nCity of Pasadena\nand Rose Bowl Operating Company filed its lawsuit against UCLA in October, adding SoFi Stadium and SoFi site owner\nKroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment\n\u2014 to the lawsuit last month. The plaintiffs sued the Regents of the University of California to compel UCLA to honor its contract.\nA breach notice from UCLA as required under its contract could have given the City of Pasadena a chance to address any alleged deficiencies or operational concerns. The latest legal document filed describes UCLA\u2019s purported intentions dating back to early this year and claims that the university never alleged any contractual default by the City or Rose Bowl.\n\u201cAt no time has UCLA ever asserted that any \u2018game-threatening default\u2019 exists [or any default by the RBOC or the City for that matter] under the agreement or otherwise,\u201d Jens Weiden, general manager of the Rose Bowl, says in the documents, per Pasadena Now.\nThe lack of a breach claim is notable because UCLA representatives were reportedly involved in private discussions in late 2024 and early 2025, Weiden says, claiming that he became aware from multiple credible sources that UCLA was looking into an \u201cimminent relocation\u201d to SoFi Stadium. Soon thereafter, reports from UCLA athletics personnel indicated that the university was in talks with SoFi Stadium executives, including Kevin Demoff, president of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, over revenue-sharing models among other topics.\nAt the same time, the suit says, UCLA continued with business as usual in its planning with the Rose Bowl as if their long-term agreement wasn\u2019t going anywhere. UCLA purportedly led the Rose Bowl on as they discussed field renovations and design work for premium seating, suggesting to the city and the Rose Bowl Operating Company that UCLA would honor its lease and stay in the historic sports venue.\nPart of the lease includes a dispute-resolution clause that allows a judge to pick a neutral third party during the dispute process. UCLA has filed a motion to compel the two sides to enter arbitration, but the city has yet to agree to enter into the dispute-resolution process.\nAs for whether UCLA is actually moving its football games to SoFi Stadium, the university said nothing is set in stone yet.\n\u201cNo decision has been made,\u201d the school said, per the New York Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Archdiocese of New York is cashing in one of its crown-jewel sites as it scrambles to cover mounting payouts to survivors of clergy sexual abuse.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan told parishioners this week that the Church would keep liquidating real estate to fill a widening financial hole tied to settlements, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. The latest move is a big one: selling the ground lease under the Lotte New York Palace for $490 million to the luxury hotel operator.\nLotte already owns the building but has long leased the ground.\nRoughly $200 million of the proceeds will go toward the next disbursement under the Church\u2019s Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, launched in 2016. The remaining $290 million is earmarked to repay loans the Archdiocese took out to fund earlier IRCP agreements and claims filed under the state\u2019s Child Victims Act.\nA spokesperson said the deal is part of a broader global settlement effort brokered with the help of a mediator.\nFor Lotte, the transaction is a chance to lock up full control of one of Manhattan\u2019s highest-profile hospitality assets. The Korean conglomerate\nbought the 55-story Palace\nin 2015.\nA spokesperson called the land buy a \u201cpivotal milestone\u201d for the brand, which still needs sign-off from the New York State Supreme Court before closing.\nThe sale is the latest in a two-year sell-down of the Church\u2019s Manhattan holdings.\nIn July, it unloaded its longtime headquarters at 1011 First Avenue to Vanbarton Group for $103 million; Vanbarton plans to\nconvert\nthe office tower to residential. An Archdiocese spokesperson said the 1011 First Avenue proceeds could also be routed toward the global settlement as the Church continues to mine its portfolio to meet obligations.\nEarlier this year, the Archdiocese sold three buildings on West 25th Street in Chelsea\nfor $48 million\nand in 2024, it shed a vacant East Village lot for up to $68 million to a team planning 570 units of housing.\nThose deals followed a late-2023 air-rights transaction in which Ken Griffin, Vornado and Rudin agreed to pay as much as $164 million for 525,000 square feet above St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Two Chicago\u2011area investment firms with deep ties to Blackstone acquired a major FedEx distribution center in Niles, outside Chicago, for a discounted $72.2 million.\nCentaur Capital Partners and Talos Capital purchased the 314,028\u2011square\u2011foot facility at 5959 West Howard Street, according to property records and brokerage JLL,\nCoStar News reported\n. The price represents a decline from the $84.3 million purchase price seller Sedco Capital, a Saudi Arabia\u2013based investment manager, paid in 2019.\nThe deal adds to a rebound of activity in Chicago\u2019s\nindustrial market\n. Investors have deployed $4 billion into the sector over the past 12 months, a 15 percent increase, year-over-year, based on CoStar data.\nThe facility is a mission\u2011critical hub for FedEx because of its strategic location one mile from I-94 and eight miles from O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nMemphis, Tennessee-based FedEx has occupied the property since its completion in 2015, and JLL noted that more than 11 acres of excess land on the site offer future development potential.\nKurt Sarbaugh, one of the JLL executives who brokered the deal, said \u201cIt is incredibly difficult to assemble a site in North Cook County large enough to accommodate a facility of this size with all of the additional car and trailer parking space required for an operation like this.\u201d\nThe buyers have longstanding Blackstone lineage. Centaur Capital Partners, based in Lake Forest, serves as the family office of John Schreiber, co-founder of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors. Schreiber recently invested roughly $180 million in Chicago multifamily projects, including the Parker Fulton Market\ntower\nand\nCobbler Square Lofts\n, in partnership with JDL Development.\nTalos Capital, based in Westchester, Illinois and led by Brian Townsend, previously served as Blackstone\u2019s industrial investment arm beginning in 2017 and prior to the creation of Link Logistics in 2019.\nThe company served as lender on the failed HFZ\ncondo project\nin Chicago. Townsend also partnered with Centaur in 2018 to assemble a 5 million\u2011square\u2011foot industrial portfolio across Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and El Paso, Texas.\nThe seller of the Niles property, Sedco Capital, traces its origins to the Saudi Economic Development Company, founded in 1976. It evolved into a family office for the Bin Mahfouz family in 1996 and later expanded into a multi\u2011investor firm in 2009.\nJLL\u2019s Sarbaugh, Sean Devaney and John Huguenard represented the seller in the deal.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Embattled Sonoma developer\nKen Mattson\ncontinues to face the prospect of losing his properties as part of his ongoing legal troubles.\nA court hearing on the terms of Mattson\u2019s bail on Wednesday centered around a disputed piece of collateral: a home at 210 La Salle Avenue in\nPiedmont\nowned by his wife Stacy that helped secure his $4 million bail package, the Press Democrat\nreported\n. The magistrate judge, Alex G. Tse, sided with prosecutors and ordered the deed to the house into bond.\nIn July, Mattson\u2019s legal team\nasked the court\nto allow him to sell two of his properties \u2014 including the one in Piedmont \u2014 in order to fund his legal bills. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nikhil Bhagat argued that the home was viable to be included as bail, while Mattson\u2019s criminal defense attorney said it wasn\u2019t because a foreclosure order is set to take effect Dec. 30. Mattson\u2019s lawyers said he should be able to sell the Piedmont home as part of his 6th Amendment rights.\nThe criminal defense attorney, Randy Sue Pollock, asked Tse, the judge overseeing Mattson\u2019s bail agreement, to wait until the trial judge\nruled on related issues as part of the handling of the majority of the government\u2019s case against Mattson. Tse rejected the appeal. Pollock agreed to hand over the deed to the Piedmont house by the end of the day on Friday, placing the estate with equity valued at $2 million into Mattson\u2019s bond package.\nBhagat confirmed the house is to secure Mattson\u2019s appearance at trial, as he was deemed a flight risk earlier this year, and that the money wouldn\u2019t go toward restitution for his victims. If the property ends up being sold out of foreclosure, the home\u2019s equity will go to the court clerk. Creditors for the home, valued at more than $6 million, sought to wrest control of the property by any means necessary, including eviction, the Press Democrat previously\nreported\n.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we finally have that lien,\u201d Risa Meyer, who invested her money with Mattson, told the Press Democrat after the hearing. \u201cIt has been a bone of contention, and a point of fear. People have been afraid that [Mattson] would be able to remain free without ever posting bail.\u201d\nMattson was\narrested and indicted in May\non nine felony counts including wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice. The Sonoma developer, who currently lives in San Francisco, stands accused by prosecutors of running a Ponzi scheme that took at least $46 million from potentially hundreds of investor clients over a period of at least 15 years.\nMattson allegedly offered and sold fake ownership interests to investors, promising legitimate investments in commercial and residential real estate. As he amassed his fortune throughout that time, he purchased more than two dozen properties in the Sonoma region worth $80 million, the Press Democrat\nreported\n. He was released on $4 million bond in late May.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

St. Regis Residences Houston is scheduled to break ground in February and be completed by June 2028 at 102 Asbury Street.\nThe filings outline plans for a 38-story, 596,012-square-foot tower with unit prices starting at $3 million. Condos will range from 2,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet, with penthouses stretching to 6,000 square feet.\nThe project aims for its defining feature to be its amenity package, designed to mirror Marriott International\u2019s St.\u202fRegis Hotels brand. It represents the first St. Regis Residences\nin Texas\n, where branded condos\nfare better\nthan the overall market.\nResidents will receive full concierge services, including valet assistance and doorstep package delivery. Recreation features will include a resort\u2011style lap pool, hot and cold plunge pools, private cabanas, steam rooms, saunas, locker rooms, a full spa, a fitness studio, yoga and movement studios, a meditation garden and a yoga lawn. Outdoors will be grilling stations, a catering kitchen and a bar.\nAdditional lifestyle amenities will include a pet spa, a dog run and park, a card room, a children\u2019s activity center, a gaming lounge, a media room, a theater and an event space. Higher in the tower, the 26th\u2011floor sky terrace aims to serve as a signature gathering area, offering a private dining room, a cognac bar, coworking spaces and the Astor boardroom \u2014 named in honor of the family that founded the St.\u202fRegis brand.\nTo accommodate visitors, the building will feature two bookable guest suites.

        "content": "Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Texas State Securities Board are at odds over a lawsuit Paxton filed targeting a large Muslim\u2011centric residential development in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market, formerly known as Epic City and\nnow called\nThe Meadow.\nThe project, led by the East Plano Islamic Center and Community Capital Partners, would build more than 1,000 homes, a mosque, a K\u201112 faith\u2011based school, senior living facilities, apartments, clinics, retail, a community college and sports fields across 402 acres in Collin and Hunt counties,\nThe Dallas Morning News\nreported.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Community Capital Partners, led by\nImran Chaudhary\n, and affiliated entities engaged in an illegal development scheme by selling unregistered securities in violation of the Texas Securities Act.\nAccording to the attorney general, investors were required to purchase an $80,000 limited partnership share in CCP to reserve a lot, and the group failed to properly register these offerings or verify that buyers qualified as accredited investors under SEC Regulation D. Paxton argues that CCP should not qualify for exemptions typically available for private offerings.\nHowever, the Texas State Securities Board publicly contradicted Paxton\u2019s claims. After conducting a months\u2011long investigation, the agency concluded that the limited partnership interests did not constitute securities under Texas law, even though they were marketed to investors in a manner resembling investment contracts.\nThe agency did not explain its reasoning, but stated that it had informed Paxton\u2019s office of its findings before the lawsuit was filed. It also advised that any potential claims might be more viable under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act rather than securities law.\nCommunity Capital Partners said in a statement that \u201cThe fact that multiple reviews were completed, and that these findings were known before litigation was filed, raises serious and unavoidable questions about why this matter is now being framed as a securities case, and why this project continues to be targeted despite repeated reviews finding no securities violations.\u201d\nSam Edwards, a Texas-based fraud and securities attorney, said he\u2019s not sure how the state board determined the investments didn\u2019t qualify as securities because \u201cthe Texas Securities Act specifically lists certain investments that are considered a security, and the first one listed is a limited partner interest.\u201d On the other hand, the agency \u201cis the authority on securities in this state,\u201d he added.\nGov. Greg Abbott has separately directed state agencies to investigate The Meadow and signed a transparency law\nrelated to the project\n. Some inquiries have already been resolved, including a Fair Housing Act\ncomplaint\nand a federal civil rights probe, while others remain ongoing.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Hochman asserted that unlicensed contractors might promise to rebuild burned homes faster and cheaper, but in hiring them, homeowners could face faulty workmanship, liability for worker injuries and sometimes even theft.\n\u201cThis increases the likelihood of fraud,\u201d Hochman said in a news conference after the charges were filed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give them a whole bunch of money upfront, and you may never see them again.\u201d\nFour separate complaints from the district attorney allege that Daniel Escarzaga, Andrew Escarzaga, Edgar Geovanni Lopez Revolorio, Melvin Hairon Mejia Ordonez and Guillermo Ramirez were contracting without licenses during a natural disaster \u2014 a felony violation of California\u2019s business and professions code. Hochman said an investigation found that the men knew they were operating without a license but offered their services to fire victims anyway.\n\u201cGet the heck out of our community, unlicensed contractors,\u201d Hochman said,\nper\nNBC Los Angeles. \u201cThese folks are not insured\u2026 If something goes wrong during this construction process and you want to go after their insurance, they have no insurance to go after.\u201d\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents Altadena, urged homeowners to use vetted lists of licensed contractors as they plan their\nrebuilding efforts\n. \u201cHiring unlicensed contractors often ends up costing more in the long run,\u201d she said.\nDuring a wildfire state of emergency, unlicensed contractors and contractor fraud could result in three years in prison or a $10,000 fine, according to Hochman. The five men are expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Jan. 8.\nJan. 7 marks one year since the deadly Eaton and Palisades fires ripped across both eastern and western portions of Los Angeles County. Unincorporated portions of the county, which include Altadena, have had 990 building permits issued,\naccording\nto the state\u2019s permitting progress dashboard, while the City of Pasadena has issued 15 so far. The City of Los Angeles, which includes the Pacific Palisades, has handed out 1,222 rebuild permits, and the neighboring\nCity of Malibu has issued\n20.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The study concluded that the system has become opaque, fragmented and overly reliant on specialized attorneys, with a cumbersome approval process involving multiple public bodies, high fees and timelines that can stretch up to three years.\nIn 2022, more than 90 municipalities in the county granted business tax breaks that removed $7.58 billion in assessed value from the tax rolls, shifting $343 million in tax burden onto\nother property owners\n. Local officials defend the incentives as essential to retain employers, attract industrial investment and compete with lower\u2011tax jurisdictions such as adjacent Will County and Indiana, according to the report.\nThe report highlights structural weaknesses such as incomplete records, inconsistent municipal reporting and the suspension of triennial affidavits during the pandemic. Incentives cover new industrial development, commercial projects, grocery stores in food deserts, brownfield redevelopment and Class 8 incentives in designated townships, but are granted largely by right, with little scrutiny of whether businesses truly need them, according to the study.\nFor example, industrial areas near the county\u2019s borders rely heavily on incentives to prevent tenant flight, yet without better data, it remains unclear whether these incentives change business behavior or simply shift or\nreduce tax revenue\n.\nThe report recommends 30 reforms, including negotiated incentive agreements, performance\u2011based standards, streamlined applications and improved data collection. A similar\nstudy in 2024\nalso suggested systemic reforms.\nPreckwinkle aims to use these changes to create a more equitable, targeted system that\nsupports disinvested suburbs\nwhile reducing unnecessary giveaways.\nBecause Cook County can reform incentives without state approval, officials see this as a rare opportunity to modernize economic development policy and strengthen commercial investment, according to the Tribune.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Of the 145 homes, 19 of them will be for households making 60 percent of the area median income. In Santa Clara County, that\namounts\nto $81,960 for one person or $117,120 for a household of four.\nThe site is owned by ARE San Francisco No. 69 LLC, an entity managed by Pasadena-based\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\n. Alexandria bought the Geng Road property, located between Highway 101 and the Baylands Athletic Center, from Hudson Pacific Properties in 2018 for $136 million.\nFlexible office provider Regus occupies one of the buildings at 2100-2400 Geng Road. Other tenants include Workday Adaptive Planning, Contemporary Technology University and software company Actian Corporation.\nThe project is the latest case of Strada betting on residential instead of offices amid a slumping office market across the Bay Area.\nAt\nanother Alexandria-owned site\n, Strada has proposed building 1,500 units across two towers at 88 Bluxome Street in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market district, becoming the first firm to take advantage of new regulations allowing large-scale development projects in Central SoMa to shift from commercial to residential use. Alexandria Real Estate and\nTMG Partners\nwere previously entitled to deliver a 1.1-million-square-foot mixed-use development including 775,000 square feet of offices. Strada\u2019s plans for the 2.6-acre site call for 785 units in one 599-foot tower and 715 units in a smaller 528-foot building.\nIn July, the company received approval from the San Francisco Port Commission to modify its proposal to build housing and office space on the Embarcadero. The developer will be allowed to build 618 units of\nhousing at Seawall Lot 330\n, currently a parking lot, while pausing to reevaluate the construction of a 375,000-square-foot office building on a 13-acre site at Piers 30 through 32 across the street.

The project will have some workforce townhomes for city employees, though the exact number is yet to be determined, Salim and Kamil Chraibi said.\nBluenest generally caps prices for its workforce homes at $451,000.\nDesigned by Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates, the complex will consist of primarily three-bedroom townhomes averaging at about 1,900 square feet, though Bluenest is considering including some four-bedroom homes spanning from 2,000 square feet to 2,200 square feet, according to the Chraibis.\nThe complex would have six buildings with three townhomes, 13 buildings with four townhomes, 20 buildings with five townhomes and nine buildings with six townhomes.\nThe project still needs site plan approval, which will be done administratively, Kamil Chraibi said.\nConstruction is expected to start in the summer or fall of next year and be completed by the end of 2028, the brothers said.\nSalim founded Bluenest in 2018, and younger brother Kamil joined about a year later. The firm has become a powerhouse in workforce housing development in\nsouth Miami-Dade\n.\nThe brothers started out building individual homes across the county and carved out their niche by seizing on South Florida\u2019s\naffordability crisi\ns and plentiful land supply in the\nsouth county area\n, the last frontier for housing construction in otherwise land-constrained Miami-Dade.\nBluenest\nhas completed 1,000 homes and has roughly 3,000 in various stages of approval and development, the Chraibis have said. The majority of homes are in South Dade, where Bluenest is one of the largest non-institutional workforce housing developers.\nIts planned projects include the 90-acre Krome, with roughly 500 townhomes and 76 large single-family homes lining the perimeter of the property and about 10 acres of commercial space, including a grocery store, in south Miami-Dade. Also in south Dade, Bluenest plans K Legacy with 57 townhomes on a 4-acre lot in Princeton.\nMiami Gardens, a city in northwest Miami-Dade, has caught developers\u2019 eyes in recent years. Cymbal DLT, led by Asi Cymbal and Hector Torres, completed the 341-unit\nLaguna Gardens\napartment complex last year at 20775 Northwest 17th Avenue. It retroactively converted it to workforce rentals, allowing it to tap into the\nLive Local Act\u2019s tax breaks\nfor below-market rentals.\nFlorida Memorial University, a historically Black university, and Redwood Dev Co have partnered on a 52.6-acre project in Miami Gardens, with the\n$500 million-plus\nfirst phase consisting of a pair of eight-story buildings with 500 student beds, 500 workforce units, and basketball courts, a turf field and academic facilities.\n",

        "content": "Miami commissioners granted two developers free land and up to $8 million in forgivable city loans for the construction of affordable and workforce housing rental projects in\nLittle Havana\n.\nThe vote in favor of the sweeteners came amid rising criticism against the city and other South Florida governments for catering to developers by awarding them perks, including land for allegedly below-market rate prices.\nPublic officials have countered that some of these carrots are a way to incentivize the construction of affordable and workforce rentals, a housing type that\u2019s acutely needed in South Florida, where many residents are\ncost burdened\n.\nIn the Little Havana deals, Miami will transfer the half-acre-plus site at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street and 825 Southwest 13th Court to N.R. Investments, which plans an 11-story mixed-income building with about 114 apartments under the\nLive Local Act\n.\nThe city also will transfer a 0.6-acre site at 1251 Southwest Seventh Street to Mabruk USA, which wants to build a 12-story building with 105 units, according to documents attached to the commission agenda. Miami will grant up to $4 million in loans to each developer.\nCity commissioners approved the land transfers and loans at their meeting on Thursday without discussion.\nThe loan to N.R. Investments will come from the city\u2019s District 3 capital reserve and affordable housing public benefits fund, and affordable housing and/or rental assistance program funds tapped from the city\u2019s MiamiCoin cryptocurrency\u200b, the agenda documents say. (Miami\u2019s District 3 includes Little Havana.)\nMabruk USA\u2019s loan will come from the HOME Investment Partnership Funds, which are allocated from the federal government.\nFor N.R. Investments\u2019 project, the city will purchase the development site for $5.9 million and transfer it to the developer, according to the South Florida Business Journal.\nThe lot at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street, home to a retail plaza, is owned by Lopez Optical; and the one at 825 Southwest 13th Court, home to a two-story office building, is owned by Ray Optical, records show.\nMiami-based\nN.R. Investments\n\u2013\u2013 led by Ron Gottesmann and\nNir Shoshani\n\u2013\u2013 proposes about 41 studios, 52 one-bedroom apartments and 21 two-bedroom apartments, about 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a three-story, 90-space garage, the firm told the city in an October letter.\nAbout 80 of the apartments will be at below-market rents, designated for households earning 60, 100 and 120 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though it\u2019s expected to be updated in the spring.\nMiami owns the vacant development site it plans to transfer to Mabruk USA. The firm, led by Nuri Dorra and Dr. Ingrid E. Dorra of North Miami Beach, proposes a project with 30 one-bedroom apartments and 75 two-bedroom apartments, ground-floor retail and a four-story garage, agenda documents show.\nAll units in the building will be at below-market rents, targeting households earning up to 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe city\u2019s approval comes with a caveat that if the developers fail to build, the properties will revert back to the city.\nThose items sailed through at the Thursday commission meeting, but a Watson Island deal was the subject of criticism.\nThe city\napproved the sale\nof 3.2 acres on Watson Island to BH3 and Merrimac Ventures for $29 million. At issue: An appraisal determined the land could be worth between $257 million and $342 million, according to the Miami Herald.\nMiami-Dade County has a\nrecord\nof giving away land it deems as \u201csurplus\u201d for below-market value in no-bid sales or leases to developers. The deals are sanctioned under a county rule that allows a commissioner to back a developer\u2019s proposal as long as the project is planned for a site the county has deemed as underutilized.\n",

Prudential Financial issued a $42.9 million acquisition loan to Space Investment for the purchase, and Eastdil Secured brokered the transaction on behalf of both parties.\nTopanga Gateway\u2019s location, high occupancy rate and tenant sales performance at the shopping center were factors in Space Investment\u2019s move to buy the development, firm co-founder Ryan Gallagher told Commercial Property Executive. It was 97 percent occupied at the time of sale with occupants like Ralphs, The Container Store and Petco as well as anchor tenant Sprouts Farmers Market. The mall, consisting of four single-story buildings on an 8-acre site, completed a renovation last year.\nIn July, Space Investment\nbought the Fullerton Metrocenter\nmall in Fullerton for $118.5 million. Seller Kite Realty Group bought the 395,703-square-foot retail property in 2021 for $103 million. A month prior, Space Investment trimmed its Orange County portfolio with the sale of the 39,300-square-foot Westport Plaza &amp; Square in Costa Mesa to Asana Partners for $25.7 million, up from the\n$18.4 million\nSpace Investment acquired it for in 2019.\nInvestor confidence in local retail\nis growing.\nIn the first 11 months of the year, the Los Angeles regional retail market saw nearly $1.5 billion in investment sales of 52 assets.

        "content": "A deal between two Chicago-based firms likely marks the first large-scale multifamily sale under the city\u2019s new\ncontroversial right of first refusal ordinance\n.\nCRG sold the 134-unit AM1980 Apartments in Logan Square to CedarSt this week in a transaction that CRG\u2019s Tom Shanabruch called a \u201cfrustrating process,\u201d due to Chicago\u2019s new set of constraints on sales under the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance.\n\u201cBeing the guinea pig in the process for this large-scale sale was interesting and sometimes a frustrating process, but we got through it,\u201d said Shanabruch, CRG\u2019s vice president of investments and capital markets.\nThough he declined to disclose a sale price, it likely fell between $30 million to $40 million because a prior sale of the property that ultimately fell through was set to close at $38 million.\nThe purchase was an opportunity to \u201cacquire one of Chicago\u2019s top multifamily assets in a supply-constrained market,\u201d CedarSt CEO Will Murphy said in a press statement.\nCedarSt is rebranding the property as The Weyland.\nThe Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, passed by the city council in late 2024, created a pilot area in parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, West Town and Pilsen. In it, tenants are given the right of first refusal if a landlord sells a building, and existing demolition fees are increased for developers seeking to replace multiunit buildings with single-family homes.\nThe program was designed to protect tenants in gentrifying areas, especially neighborhoods like Bucktown or Logan Square. The area lost 6 percent of its two-flat to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nBut after an\noutcry from longtime property owners\n, the city council later\nvoted to remove\nparts of the 31st and 36th wards from the pilot area.\nThe AM1980 Apartments, at 1980 North Milwaukee Avenue, were still subject to the new regulations.\nCRG developed the 7-story building with ground floor retail with the help of a construction loan of more than $23 million from Iowa-based Principal Life Insurance, originated in 2017, public records show. CRG retired the construction debt in 2021, replacing it with a new $24 million mortgage loan, also from Principal.\nThe firm signed off on maturity date extensions with the lender twice in the years since then, first to buy another year until April 2025, and again a few months ago to push the due date to April 2026, public records show.\nBut offloading the property was not a simple process. CRG listed it before the right of first refusal ordinance passed, but did not close a deal before it took effect.\nTo get the deal with CedarSt across the finish line, Shanabruch said CRG worked with attorney Kate Duncan at Quarles &amp; Brady to ensure the sale process complied with city regulations. Proving that tenants had been notified of the sale and given the opportunity to form a tenant\u2019s union was no simple task, he said.\nCRG sent certified mail to tenants of all 134 apartments notifying them that the building was being sold, which was an expensive process, he said. But getting a response proved even more difficult.\n\u201cWe had to get a certain percentage of them to agree that they weren\u2019t going to form a tenant union, and they did not want to purchase the building,\u201d Shanabruch said. \u201cBut we did not get enough written responses from them. So we ended up sending it via Docusign, and it really took a persistent DocuSign effort to get the signatures we needed.\u201d\nShanabruch credits CedarSt\u2019s understanding of the local market for the ultimate success of the sale.\n\u201cThey were fully understanding of the ordinance because they\u2019re in the neighborhood already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is patience is required.\u201d\nInitially another Chicago-based firm, Bradford Allen, put in a $38 million offer on the property in November 2024. But\nthat deal fell through and wound up in court.\nRepresentatives of Bradford filed a lawsuit against CRG in July, after Bradford pulled out of the deal in March. Bradford claimed that the CRG affiliate that owned the property misrepresented its operating expenses, as well as lease terms. After the deal fell through, Bradford sued to retrieve $1.9 million it deposited into escrow.\nBut CRG so far has stood firm that it has the right to keep the money, alleging Bradford Allen didn\u2019t live up to its contractual obligations as part of the sale of the property, court filings show.\nBradford also noted in court filings that the right of first refusal ordinance played a role in the deal going south because it added another complicating factor to the process, legal records show. The case is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nShanabruch declined to comment on the litigation.",

The development, dubbed Platform Moffett Park, will have 294,000 square feet of office and research space, 800 parking stalls, a shuttle bus stop and 43,000 square feet of private open space.\nThe developer said it expects to spend six to 12 months securing building permits and another two years on construction.\nThe firm furthered its push into Sunnyvale earlier this year with the purchase of Mathilda Tech Park. It acquired two buildings at 755 North Mathilda Avenue and 680 Vaqueros Avenue spanning 105,000 square feet across 5 acres. Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System sold the property for an undisclosed amount, but the Santa Clara County Clerk Recorder registered the sale at $15.5 million, the outlet\nreported\n.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, in August, Ellis Partners bought the three-building\nCampus at Scott office park\nin Santa Clara. In that deal, Ellis teamed up with Boston-based Baupost Group to buy the offices, which are largely occupied by\nApplied Materials\n, for an undisclosed price.\nSunnyvale\u2019s office market has a higher occupancy rate than other Silicon Valley cities, though its vacancy rate is still up from its pre-pandemic single-digit vacancy rate.\nSunnyvale\u2019s vacancy rate was 14.9 percent in the third quarter, below the wider Silicon Valley figure of 16.6 percent,\nper\nCBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "When Mark Nussbaum\u2019s law firm collapsed last year, it left clients scrambling to recoup missing escrow funds \u2013 and wondering where their money had gone.\nA newly filed lawsuit now points to a dead Brooklyn real estate investor as the alleged linchpin of a sprawling scheme in which hundreds of millions of dollars were siphoned from client escrow accounts.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the lawyer handling the liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, seeks to recover about $330 million from two entities formerly tied to the late Borough Park-based real estate investor Mendel Steiner. It alleges that Steiner ran a \u201cponzi scheme\u201d through Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow accounts to funnel client funds \u2013 a practice that the filings suggest led to the firm\u2019s demise.\nNussbaum Lowinger abruptly shuttered in January. Months later, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Mark Nussbaum with grand larceny for stealing $15 million from client escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Steiner lured Nussbaum Lowinger clients and prospective clients into two investment schemes which escrow funds were supposedly used to \u201cshow capital\u201d for real estate deals, and another involving fabricated joint ventures tied to property acquisitions.\nSteiner\u2019s estate has not responded to the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment.\nIn a statement, Nussbaum\u2019s attorney said \u201cMr. Nussbaum fully supports the assignee\u2019s efforts to marshal assets from bona fide sources, including the Steiner estate, and he will continue to assist the assignee to the best of his ability to ensure maximum recovery for the creditors.\u201d\nScheme 1: \u201cShow capital\u201d\nUnder the first alleged scheme, Steiner pitched Nussbaum Lowinger clients on what he described as a risk-free way to earn higher monthly returns.\nClients were told to deposit millions of dollars into the firm\u2019s escrow accounts, where the money would remain untouched and be used only to \u201cshow capital\u201d to potential property sellers as proof Steiner could close a deal.\nBut the lawsuit alleges that those promises were false.\nInstead of sitting safely in escrow, the funds were transferred to Steiner-controlled entities, including Real Green Management or Aven Realty.\nTo obscure Steiner\u2019s role, Nussbaum also allegedly replaced Steiner\u2019s name in transaction documents with a purported \u201claw firm client\u201d for whom Steiner supposedly acted as an intermediary. In some cases, the lawsuit claims, that client didn\u2019t exist, or the individual was not involved in the transaction.\nSteiner would pay some of the higher returns early on to build investor confidence, the lawsuit alleges.\nScheme 2: Phantom joint ventures\nIn a second scheme, Steiner allegedly convinced clients to invest in joint ventures on property acquisitions.\nSteiner provided Nussbaum Lowinger clients a description of the property he claimed to be buying and the name of the seller. Client money was supposed to fund deposits or acquisitions and remain in escrow until closing. Steiner allegedly promised investors a fixed return plus equity in the deal. He also allegedly told clients that he had an arrangement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allowing him to purchase multifamily projects at auction.\nThe lawsuit alleges the deals were fabricated.\nIn some instances, the sellers did not own the properties. In others, no sales agreement existed at all. And Steiner never had an arrangement with HUD.\nInstead, Steiner allegedly used the fake transactions as another way to convince clients to put money in the Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts, ultimately to be transferred to Steiner\u2019s accounts, Real Green or Aven Realty.\n\u201cIn order to induce the clients to make the investments, Mendel Steiner and MJN [Mark J. Nussbaum] prepared fraudulent contracts, emails and other documents containing fictitious names and other false information,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nMoney transfers\nThe lawsuit sheds light on how much money was moving into Nussbaum\u2019s accounts. Eight Nussbaum Lowinger clients wired a combined $380 million to the escrow account between 2022 and 2025.\nBut Steiner\u2019s companies returned only $51.6 million to clients.\nThe lawsuit was filed as part of an alternative to bankruptcy process known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The lawyer handling the process, known as an assignee, is seeking to recover money to pay back creditors of Nussbaum Lowinger.\nSteiner, who died by suicide in January in a Manhattan hotel, is the largest debtor to Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nNussbaum used his law firm as a pass-through to make bridge loans to real estate dealmakers, but many of those loans have not been paid back.\nThe lawsuit also does not provide any details about where Steiner transferred the funds after it went into his accounts. Steiner\u2019s properties have faced foreclosures and requests for receivers to be appointed, further raising questions about the value of his estate.\n",

        "content": "The MTA is taking offers for more than 300,000 square feet of development rights in Lower Manhattan.\nThe agency released a request for proposals Friday, seeking a buyer of up to 350,000 square feet of landmarked air rights tied to the Fulton Center.\nThe transit center shares a zoning lot with the Corbin Building, a terra cotta-clad office building built in 1889, which was\nlandmarked\nin 2015. Together, the two buildings are underbuilt on the lot by 358,000 square feet, of which the agency is keeping 8,000 for \u201cfuture flexibility,\u201d according to the RFP.\nThe potential pool of buyers will be limited to those who can acquire the rights through a City Planning Commission certification or through a zoning lot merger with an adjacent site. The RFP specifies that it will not accept offers from buyers whose plans would require a special permit or other land-use approval.\nMore potential buyers, however, are eligible thanks to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The text amendment eased the rules around where landmarked air rights can be transferred and freed many of these deals from the special permit process. Because of those changes, the square footage can be applied to sites across the street and within the same block of the Fulton Center, without triggering the need for a special permit, as long as such a deal doesn\u2019t increase the allowable square footage of the receiving site by more than 30 percent.\nTransfers resulting in larger projects still require a special permit and, therefore, must go through the city\u2019s land-use review process.\nAir rights transfers have been on the rise since the passage of City of Yes.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthat landmarked development rights have been trading for between $180 and 400 per square foot.\nBidders on the Fulton air rights must offer at least fair market value (as determined by the MTA\u2019s independent appraiser) to be considered. The RFP is due March 16, 2026.\n",

The seller was a trust tied to\nDaniel Grollo\n, an Australian real estate developer, that had upped the mortgage on the units to $18.9 million in 2016. The trust purchased two units in 2013 for $14.3 million, then purchased the remaining three over the next several years.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Brooklyn Heights, a trust sold a townhouse at\n19 Cranberry Street\nfor $11 million. The buyer was an LLC managed by\nMichael Saltzman.\nThe trust had owned the home since 2022, purchasing it for $12.3 million. The five-bedroom home spans roughly 5,600 square feet and dates to 1829.\nAdam Modlin\nwith the Modlin Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKaren Talbott, Kyle Talbott\nand\nScott Sternberg\nhad the listing.

The 5,700-square-foot home, which has 1,300 square feet of exterior space, is part of a two-townhouse and a condo complex developed by\nSterling Town Equities.\nThe five-bedroom residence first hit the market in 2023 with an asking price of just under $11 million.

        "content": "Access agreements are the bane of many New Yorkers trying to renovate a home.\nThese sign-offs are almost unavoidable in a city where buildings sit shoulder-to-shoulder and most apartments share walls, floors and ceilings. Both routine upgrades and ground-up construction often require workers to temporarily intrude on a neighbor\u2019s property.\nBut getting permission can be a tall order. A reluctant neighbor can send owners into months of back-and-forth. If the dispute lands in court, and many of them do, coming to a resolution can delay projects even further.\nJust last month, a trust tied to comedy writer Jill Davis and former Bain Capital managing partner Edward Conrad\nsued their neighbors\n, Sotheby\u2019s CEO Charles Stewart and his wife Catarina, over the couple\u2019s renovation of their Upper East Side townhouse. The lawsuit alleges that the parties spent years negotiating an access agreement, and that even once one was in place, the couple didn\u2019t comply with the terms.\nTo cut down on the headaches, lawmakers in Albany\nproposed legislation\naimed at establishing guidelines for the agreements and streamlining the process. Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the bill into law last week.\nThe new law only kicks in when the quest for an access agreement ends up in court. Instead of allowing judges full discretion over the terms, it outlines some standards, including requiring those seeking the agreement to ensure their neighbors have access to their insurance policies if their properties sustain any damages.\nThe statute also establishes some guardrails around the amount of compensation adjoining property owners can demand \u2014 a piece of the puzzle that often becomes contentious. The law states that while neighbors are entitled to compensation, it should be reasonable.\nStill, the law isn\u2019t exactly a catch-all fix for the strife created by obtaining these agreements, though supporters say the existence of a standard at all could encourage some parties to settle disputes out of court.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The Durst Organization is\nlooking for a buyer\nfor two of its Theater District buildings, one of which houses Jimmy\u2019s Corner, a beloved dive bar founded by the late boxer, Jimmy Glenn. A listing for the properties at 136-140 West 44th Street bills the site as a \u201cprime development\u201d opportunity \u2014 what could replace the Midtown institution? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMoMA PS1, the Long Island City-based affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, will be free for the public starting in January. The museum\u2019s latest admission numbers estimate about 200,000 people visit each year.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new study from Cornell University researchers found that air pollution has decreased in Manhattan since congestion pricing took effect in January,\nGothamist\nreported. Before the implementation of the controversial policy, the borough\u2019s air contained about 14 micrograms of fine particulate matter. That measure has fallen to 11.\n\u2014 The Department of Transportation threatened to cancel $73 million in federal funding for highways in New York if the state continued to allow international drivers to obtain trucking licenses,\nABC News 10\nreported. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency\u2019s warning came after a review found a large number of licenses issued illegally.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10.4 million\nfor 200 Amsterdam Avenue, 32B. The Upper West Side condo is 2,700 square feet and last sold in 2021 for $9.2 million.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nLisa Lippman has the transaction.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.37 million\nfor an apartment building at 1643 Popham Avenue. The Morris Heights building has nine units, is four stories and 7,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $23.5 million for 432 Park Avenue, Unit 69B. The Midtown East condo is 4,000 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 276,985-square-foot, 21-story building with 350 units at 743 East 12th Street in the East Village.

Other notable debtors include Boruch Drillman ($4.7 million), Eli Puretz ($4.1 million) and Shaya Prager ($1.1 million).\nNussbaum\u2019s assets primarily consist of his accounts receivable, real estate interests, $2 million in cryptocurrency and $91,000 in wine/alcohol, which someone in his situation could understandably need these days.\nIn another case, Mendel Deutsch of Toms River, New Jersey,\npleaded guilty\nto one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for his role in a brazen commercial mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn.\nDeutsch pleaded guilty last month, a few weeks after one of his co-conspirators, Joshua Feldberger of the title insurer Universal Abstract, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.\nDeutsche faces a maximum sentence of up to 50 years and a maximum fine of $1.25 million, although he will likely be sentenced to a less harsh punishment.\nIn politics, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nmet with real estate developers\n, lenders and investors to discuss the housing crisis, reassuring them he is open to their feedback and collaboration after big names in the industry fought against his campaign.\nMamdani acknowledged the \u201cvery important\u201d role the private market plays in housing construction, but still reaffirmed his commitment to freezing rents for stabilized tenants and support for an overhaul of the city\u2019s property tax system.\nOther key topics on the agenda included the importance of slashing the time it takes to lease up affordable housing units and the need to fund renovations for rent-stabilized apartments that are being kept off the market.\nIn commercial real estate news, David Werner is buying another property at a bargain basement price.\nThe investor is\nin contract\nto purchase the 50-story One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza tower for $270 million, a deal expected to close early next year.

It turns out that figure is more than half a billion dollars higher than the cost of a typical retrofit for a building of that size, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nA recent analysis by experts cited by the Times estimates that the Hahn building could be brought up to code for less than $150 million using common techniques applied in retrofitting other historic Los Angeles structures. Dan Rosenfeld, a developer and preservationist who is leading a campaign to halt what some see as a quiet setup for the Hahn Hall\u2019s eventual demolition, told the Times that the $700 million estimate relied on one of the most expensive methods of earthquake retrofitting.\nOfficials \u201cdidn\u2019t just put their thumb on the scale\u201d to show retrofitting was too costly and that buying the\nGas Company Tower\nwas the best option, Rosenfeld said. \u201cThey jumped on it with both feet.\u201d\nIn response, Joseph Nicchitta, acting chief executive of Los Angeles County, said \u201cthe county considered a comprehensive range of seismic options\u201d besides the most expensive ones, claiming the $700 million estimate was \u201cthe result of a competitively procured process.\u201d County officials \u201cconferred with the Department of Public Works on the various approaches [for retrofitting]\u201d that critics like Rosenfeld suggested, but the department \u201cmaintains its assessments regarding the cost, scope and budget of the retrofit project.\u201d\nLos Angeles County says there are no current plans to demolish the Hahn Hall, though L.A. County supervisor Janice Hahn \u2014 the daughter of the building\u2019s namesake \u2014 confirmed that razing much of the structure has been suggested in multiple staff meetings.\n\u201cWe are convinced that any outside, independent review would arrive at the same conclusions that we did: The building can and should be saved,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to move from the third floor to the 50th floor of the best building in town? But who benefits? Not the public.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Ed Okpa, head of real estate consultancy Okpa Company, is challenging the Dallas City Planning Commission\u2019s rejection of his rezoning request for Winners Tower, a proposed high\u2011rise in South Dallas.\nThe commission\nvoted against the proposal\nin October, citing concerns about potential displacement, the\nDallas Business Journal\nreported. Okpa has since filed an appeal that will send the project directly to the Dallas City Council, which could vote on it as early as January and has the authority to override the commission with a simple majority.\nThe current project plan includes a 150 to 160\u2011room hotel and 60 to 65 condos on a site that now houses a pharmacy, event center, offices and the Winners Assembly Christian Church.\nThe church is the property owner, with Okpa functioning as development adviser.\nCity staff previously recommended rezoning the site for buildings up to five stories, far below Okpa\u2019s original 25\u2011story vision. He argued that South Dallas has long been overlooked and that a signature tower could help the area compete with more affluent parts of the city.\nWhile Okpa, who ran unsuccessfully for Dallas mayor in 2003, disputes claims of displacement of residents \u2014 emphasizing that no additional land acquisition is planned \u2014 he has indicated a willingness to scale the project down to roughly 20 stories.\nEconomic impact studies commissioned by the developer estimate the project would cost $240 million, create about 200 jobs, and generate roughly $9 million in annual tax revenue. Okpa has pledged to allocate $90 million in construction spending to minority\u2011owned firms. He also told commissioners that C\u2011PACE financing could cover about $70 million of the cost, supported by the tower\u2019s planned solar\u2011energy components.\nOkpa insists on condos rather than rental housing to promote long\u2011term ownership and stability. He also argued that South Dallas lacks quality hotels, despite its proximity to Fair Park, a major regional events hub, he told the Business Journal.\nHe believes skepticism from commissioners stems partly from doubts about financing, and partly from bias related to his Nigerian background and\nimmigrant business partners\n, according to the Business Journal. Other minority entrepreneurs who have projects in the South Dallas market include Terrence Maiden\u2019s\nRussell Glen Company\nand Rev. T.D. Jakes\u2019\nnamesake firm,\nReverend T.D. Jakes Real Estate Ventures.\nMeanwhile, alternative visions for the site exist: Pastor Austin Anetekhai of Winners Assembly has floated an affordable housing tower with five to 13 stories.\nSouth Dallas has seen limited high\u2011rise development. The only comparable tower to Okpa\u2019s project is the 13\u2011story Park Manor, built in 1970, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "As the Alexander brothers\u2019\nsex trafficking trial\napproaches next month, details about the proceedings are beginning to take shape.\nSeveral of the alleged victims will be allowed to testify under pseudonyms at trial, Judge Valerie Caproni of the Southern District of New York ruled at a Thursday hearing.\nThe women are among other accusers tapped by prosecutors to share their experiences with one or more of the brothers, who are facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, among other crimes. Former top brokers Tal and Oren Alexander, along with their brother Alon, were arrested in Miami last December.\nDuring the hearing, Caproni sided with prosecutors, who requested the court protect the identities of 17 alleged victims whose names have not yet been made public through litigation filed against one or more of the brothers.\nOren\u2019s attorney, Marc Agnifilo\n, pushed back against the use of pseudonyms, arguing that introducing too many fake names would confuse jurors and other witnesses, and block those outside of the courtroom from coming forward with potentially significant information about the alleged victims that could aid the defense.\n\u201cWhat the government is asking here is truly unprecedented,\u201d Agnifilo said.\nAgnifilo referred to a saying among toxicologists, \u201cthe dose makes the poison.\u201d He added, \u201cThe dose here is tremendous.\u201d\nThough Caproni largely agreed with the government\u2019s position, her decision came with a few caveats. Women with common names will take the stand using their real first names and a pseudonymous last name, while women who were minors at the time of the alleged attacks and those with easily recognizable first names will be allowed to use a pseudonym for both their first and last names.\nThough their identities will be shielded from the public, defense attorneys for the brothers know the real names of the alleged victims. The court will also inform the jury and any attendees of the trial that the alleged victims called to the stand are testifying under fake names.\nAgnifilo said that the defense would prefer the victims use their real first names only if the court was inclined to grant prosecutors\u2019 request. But Caproni shot down his appeal, arguing that it would be \u201cdemeaning and infantilizing\u201d to refer to alleged rape victims by their first name while other witnesses are called by their last name.\nAll three of the Alexanders have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\u201cThis case is being framed by the government as a sex-trafficking prosecution despite the absence of evidence of force or coercion, and the defense maintains that the government\u2019s theory relies on recharacterizing consensual conduct as criminal activity,\u201d a spokesperson for the brothers wrote in a statement. \u201cThose issues, the defense expects, will be tested at trial.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many alleged victims prosecutors plan to introduce during the trial, though based on discussions in court, it appears they\u2019re working with more than 20. The latest version of the indictment, which was\nfiled last month\n, noted seven victims associated with substantive counts, while in a hearing shortly after, prosecutors mentioned another 17 alleged victims associated with the conspiracy charge.\nCaproni previously said that while she won\u2019t limit the number of victims prosecutors can call to the stand ahead of trial, she will not allow the entirety of its roster to testify in support of the conspiracy.\nAt another hearing last week, Caproni\nagreed to delay\nthe trial from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26. By the time proceedings begin next year, the Alexander brothers, who are being held at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, will have been in custody for more than a year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nCould 2026 be the year interest rates lose their rep as residential real estate\u2019s boogeyman?\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve\nvoted to cut\ninterest rates by a quarter of a point, marking the third such move this year. While not directly tied to the federal funds rate, the central bank\u2019s decision often influences fluctuations in mortgage rates, which have remained elevated over the past few years.\nThough mortgage rates dropped in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcement, they\u2019re still above 6 percent, significantly higher than the historically low rates many homeowners secured during the pandemic. That discrepancy created a \u201clock-in\u201d effect, where owners who may have already sold their homes by now are staying put to hold on to their mortgages.\nIf the last year is any indication, it appears mortgage rates will hover around 6 percent for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s likely that for many sellers, time will start to outweigh a favorable rate, so in the absence of any drastic macroeconomic changes, we can finally put the hand-wringing over rates to bed.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street. The apartment traded for $22.7 million, or $6,700 per square foot, to an anonymous entity known as Little Tiger Love. Unit 43N spans 3,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Ever wonder why city workers are not answering your calls, returning your emails or processing your applications?\nThey might be working on one of the hundreds of meaningless reports required by city laws. There\u2019s even a law requiring the city to report how many reports are required. As of 2019, according to a 57-page analysis,\nthere were 842\n.\nThe City Council is trying hard to get to 1,000. Last week, by overriding Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, it added another, and compounded the error by forcing businesses as well to file annual reports that will accomplish absolutely nothing.\nUnder Intro\n982-A\n, employers with more than 200 employees in the city must now submit annual pay data reports broken down by race or ethnicity and also by sex.\nA second law,\n984-A\n, requires the city to turn these reports into an analysis to identify disparities by industry. This must be done every single year, even though the numbers barely change from one year to the next.\nMike Bloomberg liked to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure.\u201d But wage disparities have been measured a thousand times. All the studies show that men make more than women and white people make more than people of color.\nBut few show why. And these two new laws are no different.\nLike most of the others, the city study required by 984-A will not show how much of the disparities stems from racism or sexism and how much is attributable to other factors, including employees\u2019 job responsibilities, hours, experience, seniority, commissions, etc.\nAs a result, it will be totally useless, except for grandstanding purposes.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the statistic that\nwomen earn 82 cents\nfor every dollar that men make. Twenty years earlier, in 2002, it was 80 cents. It barely changed because the discrepancy is caused by factors that are not affected by publicizing it.\nPoliticians like to chalk up the male-female pay gap to sexism, but economists have figured out that\nchoices by women\n\u2014 usually related to child care and working in lower-paying fields, such as teaching \u2014 are the primary reason. Discrimination is a factor, but it\u2019s small.\nReality check: If you work more hours, generally you make more money. Become a journalist and interrupt your career to raise kids, as I did, and you make less.\nIn 1982, women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by men. The big jump to 80 cents in 2002 was largely because women began going to college in greater numbers, giving birth later and spending less time at home with children.\nNo single factor explains pay gaps. But the reports newly required by the Council won\u2019t identify any factors. They will just create work for employers and agencies, making them tally numbers that have no practical value and will not change anything.\nActually, Intro 982-A could change one thing \u2014 it could deter businesses from hiring a 201st employee and subjecting themselves to this madness.\n",

        "content": "Lincoln Yards finally has a full slate of new players, and that alone marks the end of what Sterling Bay once promised would be Chicago\u2019s next great mega-development, nestled between wealthy Lincoln Park and gentrifying Bucktown.\nWith\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\nnow controlling the land north of the Chicago River and\nThe Real Deal\nbreaking the news this week that\nJohn Novak is buying the similarly stalled\nsouthern portion, the project has been rebooted. Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion, 14.5 million-square-foot vision isn\u2019t just being revised \u2014 it\u2019s being replaced.\nThe shift didn\u2019t happen overnight.\nSterling spent years pushing\nan audacious plan to turn former industrial land along the North Branch into a dense hub of offices, apartments, labs and entertainment. The firm deserves real credit for taking on a wildly ambitious assignment and getting as far as it did. It secured the zoning, convinced City Hall to create a tax increment finance plan and lined up heavyweight financial partners.\nBut Sterling made\nsome crucial errors\nas well. Its bet got too big, and the commercial real estate market dropped too much, for the firm to cash in. Infrastructure demands of the project multiplied, as the requirements the city thrust onto the development team\nproved too heavy to lift\n. Public support for footing a large share of those costs never fully materialized. At a certain point, the capital stack couldn\u2019t carry the vision anymore.\nNow the baton has been passed. On the north side of the Chicago River,\nJim Letchinger\u2019s JDL\nand Kayne Anderson stepped in this fall to buy former Lincoln Yards land after\nBank OZK seized the parcels\nfrom Sterling and Dallas-based Lone Star funds, setting the table for a more residential-driven plan than previously contemplated. On the south, Novak is taking control of the parcel\nJP Morgan Asset Management had been reluctant\nto take away from Sterling for over a year. Between the new owners, Lincoln Yards is no longer one coordinated megaproject but two distinct sides of the river run by unrelated teams.\nFragmentation was part of Sterling Bay\u2019s original challenge. It controlled both sides only through separate partnerships \u2014 Lone Star Funds and Bank OZK to the north, JP Morgan to the south \u2014 each with its own priorities and tolerance for risk.\nJDL and Kayne\u2019s failed effort to also buy the southern block showed the issue hasn\u2019t gone away. Chicago real estate insiders have said JP Morgan\u2019s refusal to indemnify the\nJDL-led team\nfrom loss tied to litigation that Sterling had flirted with bringing in the event the southern parcels were sold killed that transaction, though the firm hasn\u2019t commented on the matter.\nSo\nNovak\u2019s arrival\nsolves ownership on the south but introduces yet another independent operator. Whether this constellation works better the second time will depend on how closely the city corrals the groups.\nWhich brings the whole effort back to City Hall. The\nagreement Sterling Bay struck\nwith the Department of Planning and Development will almost certainly be rewritten. The previous infrastructure obligations were massive and, in hindsight, financially unrealistic without deeper public participation. Because the new developers are planning far less density, the need \u2014 and cost \u2014 for bridges, roads, utilities and transit upgrades should shrink. But the city will still have to define how much each developer pays and how much, if any, taxpayers should cover.\nThat makes the next phase simpler in some ways and more complicated in others. Easier because the ambitions are scaled back, more complex because the coordination burden shifts to the city, which must referee three owners with different business plans.\nThe Planning and Development Department declined to comment for now, other than to say that any proposed changes to past approvals and agreements would get reviewed as they\u2019re shared with city officials.\nFor Chicago residents, the hope is that any renegotiated deal improves transparency, right-sizes public exposure and finally unlocks development on one of the most valuable stretches of the river.\nLincoln Yards isn\u2019t dead but instead reincarnated. The question now is whether this new cast can do what Sterling Bay couldn\u2019t: turn land into progress rather than promise.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Los Angeles isn\u2019t what it used to be \u2014 and it seems no one knows that better than Brookfield, which now is looking to dispose of four distressed office buildings that account for nearly one-fifth of the Class A space in the Financial District.\nThe commercial giant has ceded control of some ailing offices to a court-appointed receiver, sold some at steep discounts \u2014 and it still has plenty in play. Brookfield and its lenders (and receivers and special servicers) are peddling four active offerings that totals about 4.9 million square feet of Class A office space in the submarket, roughly 18 percent of the total inventory.\nThe Financial District has a total of around 26.5 million square feet of Class A space, according to the most recent data from brokerage Avison Young (Bunker Hill is commonly considered part of the Financial District, although Avison Young breaks out the data).\nInvestors with deep pockets and hearty appetites for risk can consider:\nEY Plaza: Colliers is\nmarketing\nthe $275 million, non-preforming note tied to the property at 725 South Figueroa Street, in receivership. That note is expected to trade at a massive discount. Last the publication heard, Colliers was calling for offers. It is unclear whether it found a lucky buyer. If the brokerage did, who knows if the deal would hold \u2014 Carolwood\u2019s prior $130 million deal collapsed.\nBank of America Plaza: Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the skyscraper at 333 South Hope Street, in receivership. The debt balance is $400 million, and the brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower: Eastdil Secured is\nmarketing\nthe mortgage loan on 333 South Grand Avenue, which includes an office tower and a retail asset. The roughly $506 million debt on the property is in default, though it is not in the hands of a receiver. Bids are anticipated around $196 million, according to data and analytics provider Green Street.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s South Tower: Newmark is\nshopping\nthe skyscraper \u2014 a sister to its sibling to the north \u2014 at 355 South Grand Avenue. Bids are anticipated to come in around $157 million, per Green Street, not enough to cover the $263 million debt balance that came due.\nWhat happens now?\nA truism seems to be in the works, according to an informed industry source who said the buildings will find buyers, it\u2019s just a matter of pricing.\nSounds as though downtown\u2019s office market is still bouncing along a soft bottom. Now to see if Brookfield\u2019s latest offerings set a firm floor.\nTurnbridge turns up in desert\nTurnbridge Equities\nclosed\non a long-delayed, debt-laden development in a Palm Springs-area resort city, getting the SilverRock Resort project in La Quinta out of bankruptcy for a haircut price of $65 million, or $500,000 an acre.\nThe unfinished resort\u2019s prior developer, Robert Green, defaulted on debt and later filed for bankruptcy \u2014 $270.5 million in claims. Prior estimates put the property\u2019s value at $300 million to $400 million.\nTurnbridge has a single luxe hotel with branded condominiums and estate-sized single-family homes on its mind for the 130 acres it got. The new owner anticipates that as an initial phase that will cost $735 million to build out.\nThe SilverRock Golf Course, owned and operated by the city, is set to be transferred to Turnbridge once the hotel is completed.\nThe property, at 79179 Ahmanson Lane, isn\u2019t far from where the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals are held, ultra-exclusive Madison Club, where Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Grammy-winning singer Adele are among the list of bold-faced names who own vacation homes there.\nUnmatch\nTinder and Hinge parent company Match Group\ndumped\na West Hollywood office building. The property at 8800 West Sunset Boulevard traded hands for $35.5 million, or around $480 per square foot.\nThe buyers appear to be Omega Law Group founding partners Edwin Saghian, Robin Saghian and Shahab Mossavar-Rahmani, who signed a loan document and are members of the limited liability company named as grantee. It could be the partners were representing a client, but their accident and injury firm is located at the purchased property, so it seems more likely they are the buyers.\n",

        "content": "The story of San Francisco has largely been one of return. The artificial intelligence industry has\nprovided the latest lick\nfor the boom or bust town, and Mayor Daniel Lurie has been hailed in his first year as the right person to steer a city now bursting with cash, investment and optimism. San Francisco, as they say, is back.\nWhat could possibly slow this fiery momentum? Well, bad press seems to be a headwind everyone wants to avoid. Remember\nthe so-called Doom Loop?\nIn human nature, persistently negative narratives have a way of becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. This fact is apparently top of mind for the powers that be in San Francisco.\nLaurie Thomas, executive director of Golden Gate Restaurant Association, said as much during a Thursday panel focused on the state of retail in San Francisco. She urged the business community to refrain from the temptation to talk to news reporters \u201cwho want the gotcha story.\u201d\n\u201cYou just have to consciously remember that we kind of build our own future,\u201d Thomas said during the event, hosted by BisNow. She encouraged those speaking with reporters to remain factual, but positive, so that \u201cthe ball rolls down the hill in the right direction. \u2026 One of the things that\u2019s been helpful is working closely with [Mayor Lurie\u2019s] administration and their comms so that we all understand everything and can reposition it. The message has to stay positive.\u201d\nJoshua Callahan, managing director at private equity firm Roxborough Group, pushed back, saying that narrative and reality in San Francisco have recently diverged. Callahan acknowledged that the city enjoyed more investment than just a couple years ago, and debt was increasingly available for new projects, but the reality for business and owners and developers remains more challenging than the \u201cSan Francisco is back\u201d narrative portrays. The costs are high and margins are thin, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not obvious that good ideas are easy projects to do,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s still really tough to believe in that growth story. It\u2019s tougher than some of the narratives are starting to make it seem.\u201d\nFifty miles to the south,\ndowntown San Jose is dealing with its own narrative vs reality.\nThe Silicon Valley office market has long subsisted on hype. According to Joshua Burroughs, COO of local developer Urban Catalyst, 90 percent of office space is built on speculation. In a region where startups can quickly grow from a garage into a Unicorn that soaks up hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space, it\u2019s critical for cities to have a healthy stock of ready-to-go offices.\nYet, for downtown San Jose, much of the office space is now empty, and developers like Urban Catalyst are scaling back their ambitious visions for the skyline. Building permits submitted to the city\u2019s planning department last week showed Urban Catalyst had revised its proposal for a 21-story office tower and a 27-story mixed-use tower into a pair of eight-story apartment buildings with 626 total new housing units.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 600 units downtown, but to go from 20 stories to eight is uninspiring,\u201d a local economic development analyst told The Real Deal.\nThis comes as the Jay Paul Company is still searching for a tenant for its 19-story, million-square-foot\n200 Park project,\ncompleted in 2023. And Google\u2019s ambitious vision for its Downtown West neighborhood\u00a0 with 4,000 homes, 7.3 million square feet of office space, and an estimated economic impact of $19 billion, has been on hold for years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not no hope,\u201d one city hall staffer told The Real Deal. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fill 200 Park, and we can\u2019t get the Google project going, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the office market move.\u201d\n",
