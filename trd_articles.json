        "content": "Hugh Scott has followed San Francisco\u2019s real estate markets since the turn of the century. Walking down Market Street on Thursday afternoon, he considered the recent cycles of high and lows that give the city its Gold Rush ethos.\n\u201cThis is the biggest wave this city will see in terms of investment and growth in tech\nby a multiple of 3x\n,\u201d Scott said over the phone.\nHe is one of a handful of vice chairs for JLL, and represents tenants ranging from venture capital firms to tech startups. And while it might seem obvious that no two San Francisco booms are alike, Scott said one of the sharper distinctions between the current cycle and mid-aughts or pre-pandemic peak goes back to an industry fundamental: Location. He notes that many of the major companies headlining this next evolution, such as\nOpenAI\n,\nAnthropic\nand Perplexity, are headquartered in San Francisco, no longer confined to Silicon Valley.\nThat kind of presence has a gravitational pull on startups.\nTo-date in 2025, 83 artificial intelligence companies have leased nearly 1 million square feet of office space, according to JLL\u2019s Q3 reporting. Across all industries year-over-year, the brokerage reported 9.3 million square feet of office leasing activity in San Francisco, nearing pre-pandemic levels..\nYet, the city\u2019s office vacancy rate still hovers above 35%, and Scott said many of the negotiated leases with AI startups are short-term commitments of 30-36 months. A three-year lease doesn\u2019t bring the kind of stability as a decade, but the flexibility is critical to ensuring San Francisco remains a tech incubator, in Scott\u2019s telling.\n\u201cI think we shoot ourselves in the foot when we ask tech startups to sign a seven-to-10-year lease,\u201d Scott said. However, he acknowledged that the market could eventually swing back toward favoring the landlords. As the market gets tighter, he said, \u201cthe terms will get longer, rents get higher. But the landlords who draw a hard line now are those who won\u2019t get good activity.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s troubles cross the Bay Bridge\nNot all Bay Area office landlords are reaping the rewards of the latest boom, as more trouble appears to be afoot for San Francisco-based Swift Real Estate Partners.\nEarlier this month, Wells Fargo Bank began shopping around a distressed $102 million loan tied to a three-property portfolio owned by affiliates of Swift. The portfolio\nincluded a sprawling office plaza in Walnut Creek\n. Then news broke that Swift had stopped making payments on a 2015 loan for the Newhall Building at 260 California St, which housed the firm\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. The building had recently lost major tenants,\nand decreased in value by 60% since Swift purchased it in 2015\nfor $32.2 million.\nSwift was in the news again this week, after the San Francisco Business Times reported that China Construction Bank\nwas shopping around a $59 million loan taken out by Swift\nin 2019 to purchase a 10-story office building at 1333 Broadway St., in Oakland. The buyer who purchases the debt could also take ownership of the building, which is more than 74 percent leased and hosts a Walgreens and a Delta Dental.\nRepresentatives of Swift Real Estate Partners did not return The Real Deal\u2019s request for comment.\nGone Fishering\nAnd while San Francisco\u2019s office market ascends, Atherton\u2019s ritzy housing market has dropped. Well, relatively speaking in the national context of the wealthy enclave club. With a median home sale price of $8.3 million in 2025, the Silicon Valley enclave\u2019s 94027 zip code\nis no longer the nation\u2019s most expensive\n. The crown now rests on Fisher Island, in Miami-Dade County, where the median home sold for $9.5\nDespite a drop in the rankings, Atherton\u2019s housing market has continued to grow, notching a 5 percent increase in year-over-year home sale value. Just last week, tech venture capitalist John Jarve, of Menlo Ventures, listed his family\u2019s Atherton home for sale. The five-bedroom colonial-style house sits on 2.5 acres in the Lindenwood neighborhood. The listing agent, Charlene Cogan of Christie\u2019s, said the asking price \u201cwas outside the box for Lindenwood,\u201d an area in east Atherton where the most expensive homes often fetch below $20 million.\n",

        "content": "Earnings season comes with earnings calls, and one Los Angeles commercial real estate CEO this week showed how to work both ends of the expectations game that comes with publicly traded outfits.\nLos Angeles-based real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\nreported\nnet income of $156.2 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared to $52.4 million a year earlier. Revenue declined but not by much, with $279.7 million compared to $289.9 million a year ago.\nChief executive Angela Aman touted the firm\u2019s $205 million\npurchase\nof Maple Plaza, an office campus located in Beverly Hills. The three-story, 300,000 square-foot office space marked the company\u2019s entry to the wealthy Westside, and it might have given Aman one of the best earnings-call talking points since she took the CEO\u2019s job nearly two years ago.\nMaple Plaza was 75 percent leased at the time of purchase, and has since \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio,\u201d Aman said on the call.\nAnd that\u2019s saying a lot given Kilroy\u2019s Los Angeles portfolio encompasses 53 properties, more than 4.5 million square feet of rentable space, and is 74 percent occupied overall.\nAman and her crew told analysts and others on the call that the $5 billion company has inked more than 550,000 square feet of leases, new and renewals. Then she showed the other side of her CEO chops \u2014 managing expectations for next year, when 970,000 square feet of leases are set to expire. The company was staring at 1.9 million square feet before it locked down occupancy for about half the space with renewals. Aman said the company now anticipates \u201cmove-outs in 2026 for the majority of what\u2019s left in the expiration pool.\u201d\nThat\u2019s about 500,000 square feet, if you apply mathematics to the earnings-call narrative. Aman said the hope is to chip away at the pending expirations via new leasing.\nThe market seemed to like the overall story, in any case, sending Kilroy shares trading higher on earnings in the wake of the earnings report.\nHudson Pacific pending\nSpooky season is over but earnings season isn\u2019t. Victor Coleman\u2019s Hudson Pacific Properties reports earnings next Wednesday, and that is one we\u2019re paying particular attention to after the company posted hundreds of millions in financial\nlosses\n.\nBren ditches downtown SD\nThe country\u2019s richest developer, Donald Bren, is all out of offices in downtown San Diego. The billionaire\u2019s Irvine Company ended its reign as the largest office landlord in downtown \u2014 and its presence.\nThe company\ndumped\nits last office tower: One American Plaza, a 34-story, 650,000-square-foot property.\nJohn Saca and daughter Payton Saca purchased the real estate for $120 million \u2014 Bren\u2019s company paid about $300 million for it in 2006.\nHe appeared to have wanted out of the area, and the deal marked the end of his discount selling spree that began with the Symphony Towers in 2024.\nThis happens to be the second occasion the Sacas and Bren were in business. In November last year, John Saca\u2019s Saca Development purchased another Irvine Company-owned office building in downtown San Diego for about $44 million, or less than a third of what Bren\u2019s company paid for the tower in 2005.\nIt\u2019s uncharacteristic for Bren to sell, especially at such discounts, which makes the recent deals something more akin to tea leaves than standard comps.\nArt Deco gem in receivership\nA couple months ago, we posed a question: Does Rockwood have time to save Santa Monica Clock Tower?\nThe clock has struck midnight, it seems and the office tower is in the receiver\u2019s hands now.\nThe court\nappointed\na receiver to take control of the property that was once the tallest in the city after special servicer Rialto Capital\nsued\nRockwood Capital, alleging that the Santa Monica Clock tower owner defaulted on commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the property, and owed about $25 million. \u200b\u200b\nRockwood, according to court documents, consented to a receiver in hopes of a sale. Earlier, servicer commentary noted Rockwood expressed interest in transferring the title back to the lender \u2014 after the loan landed in special servicing and the property that is only 43 percent occupied received a value haircut.\nHonoring the late Nelson Rising\nEarlier in October, the Rose Bowl Legacy Foundation dedicated the Nelson C. Rising Legacy Bridge at the Rose Bowl Stadium. The late Nelson Rising was known for the part he played in developing Los Angeles\u2019 skyline. His son Christopher Rising, who now helms Rising Realty Partners, was there to honor his father.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s official: the mantra \u201csurvive \u2018til \u201825\u201d turned out to be too soon.\nIt\u2019s almost 2026, and most of Texas real estate is still struggling to hold on.\nEven with another dip this week, mortgage rates continue to scare off would-be homebuyers. And every time the office market seems to hit rock bottom it turns out to be a landing that leads to another downward flight of stairs.\nThroughout commercial real estate, it seems, most assets are worse off today than they were in 2020 \u2014 except in one case:\ncountry clubs\n.\nResidential markets generally remain ahead of their 2020 benchmarks, thanks the pandemic runup, but have more recently been edging downward.\nMultifamily and office developers have been gritting their teeth through the last few years.\nNo such problems for member-owned country clubs, which saw a 27 percent average jump in values nationwide from 2020 and 2023, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, after reviewing IRS filings from thousands of clubs.\nMember-owned country clubs often claim tax-exempt status by meeting certain IRS requirements for \u201csocial clubs.\u201d The exemption comes with a requirement for some public filings that provide insights on their financials.\nHouston Country Club topped the list of most valuable member-owned clubs in Texas, with its value swelling 35 percent, from $109.6 million to $147.9 million over the three-year- period. Dallas Country Club finished with a slightly lower value but a bigger increase over the period, making a 44 percent jump from $89.6 million to $128.4 million.\nThe hot streak tracks to clubs making moves to not only capitalize on the pandemic-fueled golf craze\u2013ovbiously right in their wheelhouses\u2013 but also double down by adding top-of-the-line amenities to match the latest fads, with cold plunges and infrared saunas a\u00a0 couple of examples.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the top Austin home sale last week was\na new build with access to Barton Springs Country Club\n.\nThe spec mansion at 4312 Amarra Drive was listed at $3.5 million and sold without a price cut \u2014 a rarity in\ntoday\u2019s luxury market\n. Heyl Homes built the 3,300-square-foot home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\nThe selling point isn\u2019t the open floorplan or the vaulted ceiling beams of exposed wood; it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s an 8-minute walk to a golf course designed by legendary golf course designer Tom Fazio.\nMembership to the elite Hill Country club, meanwhile,\u00a0 confers access to the Omni Barton Creek Resort &amp; Spa as well as the club\u2019s four golf courses, fitness center and tennis club, but it comes at a hefty price: the initiation fee reportedly tops $100,000, plus there\u2019s a monthly fee of about $1,000.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week:\nNitya Capital\u2019s Swapnil Agarwal says the loan backed by two of his apartment complexes\nwent to special servicing\nfor \u201ccode violations.\u201d But Morningstar Credit data shows the Houston-based syndicator hasn\u2019t made its most recent payment for the $66 million loan.\nOn the bright side, the\nauction of this Far North Dallas office building\ncould be a great redevelopment opportunity! On the not-so-bright-side, bids start at a mere $2.25 million or $8.65 per square foot for the 10-story, 260,000-square-foot property, giving the Dallas office market an opportunity to log a new bottom.\nD.R. Horton is trying to lure homebuyers back to the market with\nincentives\nlike rate buydowns and closing-cost assistance. Word came in an earnings call where the Arlington-based company reported that profits sank 25 percent to $3.62 billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.\nMeanwhile,\nstatewide housing supply\nis the highest it\u2019s been since 2012. Texas had 5.5 months of inventory last month \u2014 the highest it\u2019s been since surpassing six months in 2012. Supply in major metros has surpassed the post-recession waterline. Dallas had 4.8 months of inventory in September. Both Austin and Houston had 5.4 months. In September 2012, when the housing market had finally stabilized from the Great Financial Crisis, Dallas had 4.2 months of inventory; Austin had 3.6 and Houston had 4.8.\nThe Salty Donut isn\u2019t worth its salt, if you ask its lender, City National Bank of Florida. The\nbank sued the confectionery\nin August, claiming it defaulted on a $4.8 million loan the bank provided so The Salty could develop a new store in Houston. The store never materialized. It did open a Katy location in 2024, but the donut maker\u2019s first Houston outpost doesn\u2019t appear on its website.\n",

        "content": "The Pastorelli family\u2019s Fulton Market property has become a case study in what happens when sellers fall in love with their own price tag.\nThe longtime home of\nPastorelli Food Products at 901 West Lake Street\nis the subject of a foreclosure lawsuit filed Wednesday by Old Second National Bank \u2014 a $3 million reckoning that caps nearly a decade of missed opportunities in Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhood.\nRichard Pastorelli and entities tied to his company defaulted on a $3.4 million loan that matured in May, leaving more than $3 million unpaid plus interest piling up at over $1,000 a day. That\u2019s according to Old Second\u2019s legal complaint filed Wednesday, which shows the mortgage traces back to 2020.\nNeither Pastorelli nor\nOld Second\u2019s\nattorney returned requests for comment.\nIn any case, the 12,500-square-foot site\u2019s best chance appears to have come in 2016, when Pastorelli \u2014 a fifth-generation operator of the family foodstuffs business \u2014 first floated it for sale.\nMultiple developers made offers, but Pastorelli soon gained a reputation for pushing his luck on a quest for eight figures. Several developers have said his expectation was clearly out of step with the market for teardown industrial sites poised for residential or mixed-use plays.\nPastorelli might have gotten a reality check from recent turns in the market, but he still seems out of step. Multiple developers told me the property owner called seeking a deal at $12 million, only to be shrugged off. Another neighborhood real estate pro said the market is no longer anywhere near such a price.\nEven Sterling Bay \u2014 builder of Google\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s corporate offices in Fulton Market \u2014 has\ntaken a loss\non land in the area recently.\nRelated Midwest\u2019s plan to build a\n43-story apartment tower next door\nto Pastorelli\u2019s property, which it completed in 2023, probably offered Pastorelli his widest offramp.\nEven if Related didn\u2019t offer to buy it (a source told me the firm did), the fact of its project going forward would likely have drawn other interest in the Pastorelli property \u2014 if the owner had been reasonable on price.\nPastorelli\u2019s price wasn\u2019t a complete pipe dream. Land values in Fulton Market were skyrocketing before the pandemic.\nBut there\u2019s some difficulty on the Pastorelli site to contend with: it already holds a 25,000-square-foot building, and even with zoning that brokers over the years have said would allow a 12- to 14-story building, there are \u201cL\u201d tracks running along Lake Street next door. Some developers question whether they could build that big due to the site\u2019s size and location inside a historic district. That all makes redevelopment a little more tricky and costly.\nStill, by 2024, with Related having recently completed the 300-unit development project next door, the Pastorelli plant again hit the market, this time under a more formal listing with\nJLL\n. The site, zoned for dense development, drew curiosity but no buyers willing to meet ownership\u2019s number.\nThat\u2019s the rub in this story: a hot neighborhood doesn\u2019t mitigate the gamble that comes with holding out for an ambitious price. Pastorelli bet that Fulton Market\u2019s land values would keep rising faster than developers\u2019 pro formas. Instead, the market moved on, interest rates spiked, and lenders grew less patient. Now, Old Second is asking a judge to foreclose, name a receiver and auction off the property to cover the debt.\nIt\u2019s a cautionary tale for every owner convinced their dirt is worth more than the last guy\u2019s \u2014 especially in a submarket that rewards velocity over nostalgia. Fulton Market has minted fortunes for those who sold or built at the right time. But wait too long, and even\na prime corner\ncan turn from opportunity to liability.\nRelated\u2019s tower has already risen next door, reshaping the skyline. The Pastorelli site, meanwhile, could end up a footnote in the very boom that transformed the longtime home of food businesses in Fulton Market.",

        "content": "Median\ncondo\nprices were caught slipping the past couple of quarters but the Los Angeles luxury market is\u00a0 bucking that trend.\nA deal reported this week at the\nMaybourne Beverly Hills\nillustrates the point.\nUnit 8E at 225 North Canon Drive traded in early October for $27 million, or $4,762 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s a big price tag even given the property\u2019s provenance\u2013it sits squarely in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills\u2013draws buyers with bold-face, and was known as the Montage until Qatar-backed Maybourne Hotel Group paid $415 million for it in 2019.\nThe four-bed, six-bath condo that recently sold went from one trust tied to philanthropists Paul and Hisako Terasaki to another linked to Gustavo\u00a0 and Maria Esther Marquez, owners of Hispanic food maker and distributor Marquez Brothers International.\nThe deal is notable not only for being one of the property\u2019s priciest, but it beats a previous record reported in 2021. That involved Los Angeles Rams owner\nStan Kroenke\n, who paid $23.8 million for his condo. It\u2019s also Beverly Hills\u2019s priciest on-market condo trade over the past year.\nThere\u2019s more.\nOctober\u2019s deal is now Los Angeles County\u2019s second priciest condo sale in the past 12 months. No. 1 is a penthouse unit at\nThe Century\nin Century City, after it sold for $39.1 million in January.\nLuxury insulation\nDeals like the one at the Maybourne weren\u2019t enough to help pull up the overall condo market. Across Los Angeles County, median condo closing prices fell the past two quarters, according to the most recent Douglas Elliman report.\nLuxury tells a different story, with a rising median\nprice\n, according to the Elliman report which counts luxury as the top 10 percent of sales.\nThe broad comparison is stark\u2013the median price of a sold luxury condo spiked 69 percent from the year-ago period to $4.7 million in the third quarter, according to Elliman. That compares with the broader condo market\u2019s median sales price decline of 3.8 percent year over year to $1.1 million.\nTops this year\nWhat L.A.-area markets are winning this year? So far,\u00a0 the usual suspects are driving the upper end of the condo market. Here\u2019s a look at the top deals in some of the county\u2019s high-end residential markets this year, based on Zillow records of on-market sales:\nCentury City\n1 West Century Drive #Penthouse 39\nSold in January for $39.1 million or $4,153 per square foot\nBeverly Hills\n225 North Canon Drive #8E\nSold in October for $27M or $4,762 per square foot\nWest Hollywood\n8899 Beverly Boulevard Unit 7B/E\nSold in March for $15.5M or $2,886 per square foot\nBrentwood\n505 Barrington Avenue #100\nSold in September for $7.8M or $1,400 per square foot\nSanta Monica\n951 Ocean Avenue #404\nSold in March for $7.3M or $2,330 per square foot\nHollywood Hills\n8420 Sunset Boulevard #803\nSold in July for $7.2M or $2,647 per square foot\nMarina del Rey\n5205 Ocean Front Walk #301\nSold in January for $4.9M or $1,789 per square foot\nThe Westside spread makes Downtown Los Angeles look quite middle market. The\u00a0 top deal in the city\u2019s center comes in at $1.8 million, or $766 per square foot, for a unit at 1155 South Grand Avenue.\nCrescent Heights conversion\nSouth of L.A., in Orange County, Crescent Heights clearly sees opportunity in for-sale units.\nThe Miami company hung up the for-sale sign on the towers\u2019 units after snapping up\n9 MacArthur Place\nin April for $240 million, per the\nOrange County Business Journal\n.\nA full price range isn\u2019t known for the two towers, but units currently listed go from $851,825 to $1.1 million.\nLori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli find buyer\nIn single-family homes news,\nLori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli\nmay finally be able to part ways with their Hidden Hills home.\nThe property at 25210 Jim Bridger Road, listed for just under $15 million, is in contract. It topped the week ended Oct. 26 for signed contracts in L.A. County.\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming for the now separated couple, who reportedly first placed the home on the market last spring for $17.5 million. It was re-listed in February for $16.5 million and then repriced again in July at the current ask.\n",

        "content": "The Real Deal\n\u2018s Miami Forum is this week. Don\u2019t go unprepared: Here\u2019s a primer on the South Florida real estate market.\nMacro issues are affecting the tri-county region. President Trump\u2019s immigration policies threaten population growth in South Florida, which trickles down to fewer renters signing leases and an overall drop in consumer spending that affects other sectors of the real estate market. Developers have learned how to navigate the tariff landmines. It\u2019s the thinning profit margins, driven by the high cost of land, construction and insurance, that are having a bigger impact. More projects\nwill be canceled\nor sold to new partnerships that plan to revive them.\nBefore we get too into it, the event will be held at Mana Wynwood in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday (Nov. 5 and 6). If you haven\u2019t purchased your ticket yet, use the code WEEKLYDIRT and\nthis link\nfor 20 percent off general admission. Here\u2019s a link to\nthe schedule\n.\nMy colleagues and I will be moderating key conversations about market headwinds and opportunities, what resi brokerages owe their agents (and what they don\u2019t), the next generation of office space, how developers and brokers are recapturing the international investor, the keys to leveraging social media, the growing role that architecture and interior design play in high-end sales, and more.\nOur Publisher, Amir Korangy, will also lead separate, one-on-one conversations with controversial investors Grant Cardone and Patrick Carroll.\nHere are dispatches from our South Florida team, based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from sources and speakers ahead of the event:\nResidential boom is uneven\nDemand for luxury waterfront homes continues, but the condo market is a bit more irregular. Agents are also banking on another wave of New Yorkers migrating to South Florida, in this case driven by the mayoral election in New York. Corcoran Group agent Mick Duchon said that these deals don\u2019t happen overnight. State Rep. Zohran Mamdani\u2019s expected win will just propel New Yorkers who have been thinking about or planning a move already.\n\u201cThese transactions are weeks, months and sometimes years in the marking,\u201d Duchon said.\nCondo developers are coming out of a tough summer. Some have found their sweet spot with\u00a0 more affordable projects geared toward short-term rental investors, while others are seeing success in ultra-luxury boutique properties. But the oversaturation of branded projects (or just using the wrong brand) has made it increasingly difficult to sell condos.\nThe general resale market, which has seen months\u2019 worth of year-over-year declines, rallied in\nSeptember\n. Dollar volume in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties surged 13 percent to $4.3 billion, up from $3.8 billion last September, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. But while sales were up, condo prices were either flat or down across the tri-county region. Single-family prices were either flat or showed moderate growth. The level of price growth we saw post-pandemic is gone.\nForeclosures ahead\nSouth Florida has seen an uptick in lenders foreclosing on development sites where projects have not broken ground, and one case where a builder lost the property. Rok Lending, the mortgage arm of the Rok family, acquired an Aventura development site owned by an affiliate of Miami-based developer Marlon Gomez. The developer, who filed a notice of appeal, had planned a medical office project.\nBrian Tuttle, the owner of the mixed-use Mainstreet at Tuttle development site in Royal Palm Beach narrowly avoided a foreclosure auction by filing for bankruptcy on the same day the property was set to be sold at a foreclosure auction. And in recent months, lenders have filed foreclosure lawsuits against an entity managed by developer\nHarvey Hernandez\n, which owns a Fort Lauderdale condo development site; as well as an entity previously managed by developer Dan Kodsi, which owns a condo-hotel development site in Miami\u2019s Art &amp; Entertainment District. Kodsi told\nThe Real Deal\nthat he is no longer involved.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado\nSouth Florida\u2019s apartment construction boom carries on\nThis is despite a current supply overhang and a slowdown in leasing and rent growth compared to the pandemic-era peak. Last year, a record 18,600 units were completed in the tri-county region, which outpaced new leases by more than 3,000 units. Median asking rents are also decreasing on a year-over-year basis. Some developers and landlords have been offering concessions. But apartment developers overall\nremain optimistic\nand believe demand will return by the time new projects are completed.\nOffice market leveling out\nSouth Florida\u2019s office investment sales market showed a slight pickup over the past year. But it\u2019s not all great news, as leasing by new-to-market firms has slowed compared to the pandemic boom. While institutional investors are coming back to the market to purchase office buildings, they\u2019re carefully picking trophy properties in deals that are few and far between.\nCase in point: In the fourth quarter of last year, Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management paid $443 million for the 701 Brickell Avenue tower in Miami\u2019s financial district. By comparison, the top office deal so far this calendar year was done by a family office. Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s Ponte Gadea, an investment vehicle for Ortega\u2019s dividends from his retail empire, paid $274 million for the Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell.\nEven for those deals, cap rates were higher amid the higher interest rate environment and harder financing climate for offices, experts said. Also, many lenders have redlined offices and are making no exceptions for South Florida.\nAnd many of the planned office projects announced during the recent market bonanza are on hold or have been canceled.\n\u2014 Lidia Dinkova\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nTuesday\u2019s election. Go vote!\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nPinchas and Lindsay Goldshtein sold the waterfront, single-family home at 10241 East Broadview Drive in Bay Harbor Islands to Garfield RE LLC for $12.8 million.\nCommercial:\nBoca Raton-based Penn-Florida Companies sold the development site at 375 East Royal Palm Road in Boca Raton for $27 million. SobelCo, also based in Boca Raton, purchased the property, as well as the adjacent 0.2-acre site at 343 East Royal Palm Road for $3.1 million.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach hit the market for $89 million. The six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom, 8,259-square-foot home at\n102 Reef Road\nsits on a 0.8-acre lot. It\u2019s listed with Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate. Property records show C. Steven Duncker, a retired partner at Goldman Sachs and a thoroughbred horse racing figure, and his wife, Melinda, own the home, which was built in 2014. They paid $6.3 million for the property in 2011.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nGive Miami Day is Nov. 20. The 24-hour fundraising event collects and distributes contributions to more than 1,300 nonprofits, including\nthese\nhousing-related organizations.\nElsewhere in Florida\nGov. Ron DeSantis directed Florida\u2019s Board of Governors to \u201ccrack down\u201d on the use of H-1B visas at state colleges and universities, the\nTallahassee Democrat\nreports. DeSantis accused the schools of hiring foreign workers over qualified Americans.\nThe last remaining Royal Castle in Miami closed its doors. The decades-old location of the burger chain on Northwest 79th Street and 27th Avenue is now vacant and available for lease, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nElected officials and food banks in South Florida are warning of a crisis if the government shutdown halts food assistance programs like SNAP, which one in four Miami-Dade households rely on,\nNBC Miami\nreports. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said local agencies are preparing for a surge in need.\nMiami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier and franchise owner Steve Ross parted ways following the team\u2019s disappointing 2-6 start to the 2025 season, according to the\nHerald\n. Ross said the move marks the beginning of needed changes.",

        "content": "This election season, the left is at war. With itself.\nIt\u2019s not the mayoral race that has divided ultra-progressives, but real estate. Specifically, four land-use reforms on the ballot.\nThe far left\u2019s split on proposed City Charter revisions is a major reason that their candidate for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, has been so hesitant to take a position, unlike on all other issues.\nLeft-wing writer Michael Kinnucan\nexplained\nthe socialists\u2019 split in the publication Jacobin, a bible of the far left: Some tenant organizations oppose the reforms because they would reduce individual City Council members\u2019 leverage to demand more affordability.\nThe problem with that argument is that some use their leverage to stop projects entirely, for NIMBY reasons by demanding too much affordability.\nThat\u2019s one reason Kinnucan did the right thing and endorsed a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the ballot questions, which will tweak the rezoning process to modestly increase housing production, including affordable projects in the neighborhoods most resistant to them.\nThe headline: \u201cYou can\u2019t have social housing without building housing.\u201d\nSeems obvious, no? But even obvious facts about real estate are hard to see for people wearing ideological blinders.\n\u201cLoosening the city\u2019s anti-housing regime is essential if we ever want to build social housing at scale,\u201d he wrote, wisely focusing on subsidized housing to appeal to his readers, even though privately funded housing is at least as important to solving today\u2019s supply crisis and preventing future ones. (See the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s study on\nfiltering\n.)\nLongtime advocacy group Tenants PAC outright lied to its followers about the charter proposals, telling them \u201cthere is no affordability mandate whatsoever.\u201d Reality check: With rare exception, the proposals only work with Mandatory Inclusionary Housing or the even deeper affordability required by Department of Housing Preservation and Development or housing finance agency term sheets.\n\nThe rare exception is in the R1 to R5 \u201cElurp\u201d action because those zoning designations don\u2019t include affordability. The charter cannot magically add it any more than a frog can grow wings.\nTenants PAC also claimed that Proposal 3 lets some projects grow in size by 30 percent \u201con top of the 40 percent granted by City of Yes earlier this year.\u201d City of Yes (which passed last year) allows those projects a 20 percent increase, not 40 percent, and only if they have enough affordable units.\nThe Jacobin article called the opposition \u201can odd coalition, uniting conservatives who systematically oppose virtually all construction, including affordable construction, with tenant activists who support massive city investment in social housing.\u201d\nKinnucan added that Mamdani\u2019s social housing plan would be \u201cnear impossible\u201d without the charter revisions.\n\u201cIf the city\u2019s social housing program is subject to the unappealable veto of every individual city council member, every development will require months of negotiation over building heights and parking minimums, and much of the city\u2019s land area will be quite simply off limits,\u201d he wrote.\nWhy is rezoning even necessary? Because we can\u2019t build our way out of the crisis without it when 40 percent of the city is zoned for single- or two-family housing and 30 percent is low-density multifamily.\nThe\nmember-deference\nsystem, Kinnucan told his fellow lefties, has produced \u201ca crippling housing shortage that gives landlords the upper hand against tenants.\u201d\nWhy Tenants PAC wants to preserve it is baffling indeed.",

        "content": "At 32 years old, Moshe Silber had it all.\nSilber owned two Gulfstream jets, a pad in London, three multimillion-dollar homes and millions worth of luxury cars and jewelry.\nSilber, a lanky and youthful-looking native of an Orthodox enclave in Rockland County, was on his way to becoming extremely wealthy in 2022, at least on paper. He claimed to have $1.3 billion in total assets with his equity position at over $600 million.\nSilber\u2019s quick rise and growing real estate portfolio of 10,000 units impressed the bankers at Piper Sandler, and the investment bank offered its clients and employees a chance to get in on Silber\u2019s real estate play.\nPiper Sandler worked with\nSilber\nto issue $200 million of unsecured bonds in one of Silber\u2019s companies, Crown Capital Holdings, through a private placement. The money would be used to fund and purchase real estate, mainly consisting of Section 8 housing. Large and small life insurers, community banks and some high-level Piper Sandler employees bought the notes offering rates between 6.75 percent and 12.5 percent.\nSince the bonds were unsecured with no properties pledged as collateral, the investment relied on Silber, the whiz-kid from Monsey, who survived a difficult childhood and amassed a real estate empire out of an office on the 85th floor of One World Trade Center.\nIn the best-case scenario, the $200 million would go into Crown Capital to buy real estate at a lower interest rate, allowing Silber to flip the properties at a higher price, and increase cash flow to investors.\nBut, according to the bondholders and a fiduciary appointed to oversee Silber\u2019s former companies, that is not what happened. Instead, Silber was charged and\nsentenced\nin\na mortgage fraud scheme\n. No one is quite sure where all the money went.\nB\nirth of an entrepreneur\nMoshe Silber was born in Brooklyn and moved to Monsey when he was 12.\nHis father, Zalman Silber, was an entrepreneur best known for Skyline Entertainment, a company that offered virtual helicopter rides inside the Empire State Building in the late \u201990s and early 2000s.\nIn about 2008, Zalman faced serious allegations as he underwent a divorce. Silber\u2019s mother accused Zalman of performing fake \u201cgynecological exams\u201d on her, according to news articles from the time. The accusations led to Zalman\u2019s arrest and charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and Rockland County and some crude headlines in the press. Moshe was also questioned by law enforcement.\nThe charges against Zalman were dropped when Silber\u2019s mother lied under oath on an unrelated matter, according to press reports.\nMoshe\u2019s parents divorced. Meanwhile, Zalman ventured overseas on business to Australia.\n\u201cHe [Moshe] was completely unloved. And he had, you know, a terrible time as a young man. He was terribly scarred,\u201d Jerome Ballarotto, an attorney for Moshe Silber, said years later, during Silber\u2019s fraud-sentencing hearing.\nBallarotto said Moshe experienced his mother\u2019s wrath, but also \u201cspent a lifetime chasing the shadow of his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\u201cConfounding.\u201d\nU.S. JUDGE ROBERT KIRSCH ON MOSHE SILBER\u2019S FINANCIAL SITUATION\nAfter graduating from a yeshiva in Brooklyn, Moshe Silber went into real estate in 2010. He worked with a large operator controlling 5,000 units in New York City where he claimed to be in charge of all \u201coperations, including rent collections, maintenance and repairs, lease negotiations, tenant buy-outs and building refinancings,\u201d according to an SEC filing.\nOutside of work, he became a volunteer EMT in Rockland County, going out days and nights and once reportedly saving a child\u2019s life by performing CPR. He got married, had six kids and moved into a house in Suffern with eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms. People have described him as a nice, unassuming young man and devoted father who happened to have expensive tastes. His attorney, noting Moshe\u2019s work as an EMT, referred to his client as a \u201ccaped crusader.\u201d\nAt a certain point, Silber became connected with Fred Schulman, a lawyer with a degree from Boston College, three decades older than Silber.\nWhile Schulman saw himself as a father figure to the younger Silber, it appears that Silber was the brains of the real estate operation. In 2012, Silber, then in his early 20s, created Rhodium Capital, which he described as a \u201creal estate syndicator.\u201d He also founded a real estate holding company, CBRM.\nSilber\u2019s companies bought mostly low-income real estate across the U.S., including in New York City, where Rhodium paid $98 million, or $394 per square foot, for 361 rental apartments in Harlem and Washington Heights in 2016. Other acquisitions included a 462-unit portfolio in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and office buildings in Jersey City and Somerset, New Jersey.\nHis wealth grew rapidly in the Covid years when cheap interest rates created a bonanza for investors like Silber who started buying real estate.\nBy early 2022, Silber had surpassed his industry contemporaries with master\u2019s degrees from Columbia University or internships at Blackstone or KKR. He owned multiple real estate companies, a private jet business with planes valued at $60 million, and a bank in Westchester County. His real estate holdings totaled nearly $1 billion. Silber did not return a request for comment and an attorney representing Silber in bankruptcy proceedings declined to comment.\nAnd he had discovered a shortcut to the traditional real estate financing model.\nU\nnderwriting Silber\nIn a normal real estate deal, a sponsor raises equity from investors for a property. The remainder is financed with debt from lenders. The sponsor makes money from rent, but the real returns come years later when the owner refinances or sells.\nSilber removed the property from the equation.\nIn 2020, Silber appears to have gotten a line of credit somewhere between $75 million and $100 million from an affiliate of UBS\u2019s hedge fund O\u2019Connor for Silber\u2019s companies, Crown Capital and CBRM. Filings with the state of New York show Silber pledged collateral for the loan in 2020. A source familiar with the situation said Silber repaid the loan from UBS in 2022.\nThe line seemed to establish that Crown was creditworthy.\nBy the first quarter of 2022, Minneapolis-based\u00a0 Piper Sandler was underwriting a new private debt issuance \u2014 this time, bonds. Crown Capital, which indirectly owned real estate through various LLCs, would issue the debt as a private placement. While it is not unusual for large companies or REITS to issue bonds to finance their real estate operations, it is uncommon for a company of Silber\u2019s size and obscurity to do so. REITS are publicly traded and are required to disclose financials to their public investors. Private companies do not have the same obligations.\nIt is unclear how Silber became connected with Piper Sandler in the first place.\nPiper Sandler is a six-year-old investment bank formed from the merger of two older companies, Piper Jaffray, a 130-year-old Minneapolis investment bank that specialized in servicing mid-market companies, and Sandler O\u2019Neill, started by former Bear Stearns executives in New York City in 1988. Sandler\u2019s idea was to work with small firms whose value its founders thought went underappreciated on Wall Street, and it built an early fixed-income desk, which it rebuilt after 40 percent of its employees were killed on Sept. 11, 2001. When Piper Jaffray bought Sandler O\u2019Neill in 2019, it was hoping to double its fixed-income revenue, the firms told the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cMoney and material wealth do not define who we are. True fulfillment comes from serving others. Somewhere along the way, I lost sight of what truly mattered. I let money and a deal take priority over everything.\u201d\nMoshe Silber at his sentencing for mortgage fraud\nOver the course of 2022, Piper Sandler privately underwrote three rounds of bonds on Crown. It was part of a wave of interest in private placements, where companies can issue debt in the private market to accredited investors. This type of debt has become increasingly common with life insurers as they search for higher returns for cash. Privately placed debt accounts for 20 percent of life insurers\u2019 bond investments in 2022, compared to 13 percent in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nBuyers of the Silber bonds included Customers Bank, Federated Mutual Insurance, Cincinnati Life Insurance Co and a list of midsize insurance firms and banks, including First Catholic Slovak Union, Western Catholic Union, First Dakota National Bank, Bar Harbor Bank &amp; Trust and Ukrainian National Association.\nIts own employees also bought in, including senior managers from the Sandler side: Edward Stein, Jacques de Saint Phalle and John Beckelman. Beckelman is head of Piper Sandler\u2019s fixed-income division and on the firm\u2019s leadership team. In total, the three Piper employees purchased $2.3 million of Crown\u2019s paper.\nThe Real Deal was unable to review the bond offering, but sources indicate that it was persuasive. The fundamentals of the firm seemed strong. Silber and his real estate holding company, CBRM, had $66 million sitting in various checking accounts as of March 2022, Silber\u2019s financial statements show. Silber had $219 million in equity interests in properties held by CBRM, he claimed, giving him skin in the game. His dozens of multifamily rental properties had solid cash flow, with predictable revenue from tenants in subsidized federal housing programs. At the time of the appraisals in 2021 and 2022, multifamily valuations were at an all-time high.\nAs part of the private offering, Silber offered a guarantee in Crown\u2019s parent company, CBRM, of which Silber was the sole shareholder. If Silber defaulted, bondholders could pursue Silber or his company, but they could not immediately seize Crown\u2019s properties.\nBy December, clients had picked up $200 million in Silber bonds.\nD\nouble dipping\nIn practice, the bonds were an ingenious way to finance real estate, but in actuality, the money was like a blank check.\nBondholders did not have a lien or a secured interest in the properties that had made the firm look so creditworthy.\nSilber controlled Crown\u2019s books, records and the financials that were ultimately presented to them.\nAnd so, at least some of the bondholders did not appear to know about the extent of Silber\u2019s leverage, which saddled the properties with a total of $450 million in property-level mortgages.\nLenders on Silber\u2019s properties were also in the dark. They were not aware there was such a vast sum in bond financing for the same buildings, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Silber took a distribution not long after the bond issuance. The amount: $90 million.\nAn independent fiduciary and financial advisors are investigating the exact whereabouts of the rest. The fiduciary who took over Silber\u2019s firm alleges that he extracted at least tens of millions and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars for his own benefit, according to the fiduciary\u2019s attorney.\nD\nefault and disarray\nAfter the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2022, Silber\u2019s financing costs increased and values of his multifamily holdings declined.\nThe portfolio started to collapse. By 2023, the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing and Finance Agency were looking into Schulman and Silber for their involvement in a mortgage fraud scheme.\nThe scheme, one of many being investigated by the DOJ, involved investors flipping properties to affiliates at higher prices than they\u2019d just paid in order to secure inflated loans. (Silber\u2019s scheme was particularly bold because he used a stolen identity instead of an actual associate to facilitate the flip, resulting in a $74 million inflated loan from Fannie Mae and JLL.)\nSilber and Schulman prioritized defending possible criminal charges, which stole focus from their real estate operations, according to court filings.\nProperties fell into disarray and Silber lost eligibility for affordable housing programs, which had sustained his rent rolls. Without revenue, he defaulted on loan obligations, according to a report from a financial advisor to the debtor in bankruptcy court.\nIn 2024, Silber pleaded guilty to the mortgage fraud scheme, and Silber and his partner Schulman effectively became unbankable.\nSilber agreed to appoint an independent fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, and management company, Lynd, to oversee his properties. Silber still remained the sole shareholder.\nHe also looked to obtain financing from high-interest lenders of last resort to ensure he did not default on bond payments by providing personal guarantees and a pledge of assets.\nOther lenders started going after Silber personally on guarantees.\nT\nwice pledged\nBoth UBS O\u2019Connor and the bondholders had a claim on CBRM, they soon discovered.\nIn mid-2024, a New York state judge issued UBS O\u2019Connor a default judgment. A company called Spano Investor acquired the judgment and then put CBRM, which controlled Crown Capital\u2019s real estate, u\np for auction\n.\nDays before the auction, the fiduciary of Crown Capital and CBRM put the entities into bankruptcy protection, to stop the sale, listing the bondholders as unsecured creditors with a $200 million claim.\nAmong the bondholders, the largest claims came from Customers Bank and Federated Life Insurance with unsecured claims of $41.5 million and $32 million. A total of 69 insurance companies, banks and Piper Sandler employees have claims on Crown Capital.\nThe debtors set up a litigation trust to pursue possible claims against Silber, Schulman and even Piper Sandler.\n\u201cWe are aware of the bankruptcy of Crown Capital Holdings and have monitored the events concerning Moshe Silber that preceded it,\u201d a spokesperson for Piper Sandler said. \u201cThe situation is deeply disappointing and is likely to have a negative impact on our clients and our own employees.\u201d\nW\nhat truly matters\nIn March 2025, a judge sentenced Silber to 30 months in prison for participating in the mortgage fraud scheme.\nSix months later, while in prison, Silber filed for bankruptcy. Not only was the $200 million gone, his filing showed, but so was everything else \u2014 the jewelry, jets and London flat.\nHe listed zeros for his assets and income and claimed his father Zalman paid his legal fees.\nAt his recent deposition taken in prison, Silber pleaded the Fifth. In a typewritten letter from prison, Silber attributed the properties\u2019 poor state to the management company and the independent restructuring officer.\nYet Silber\u2019s father was giving him about $300,000 a month, or over $3 million a year, U.S. Judge Robert Kirsch noted. Silber\u2019s attorneys said this money went to keep his real estate operations afloat.\nSilber\u2019s financial situation overall was \u201cconfounding,\u201d Kirsch said: Silber was affiliated with over 184 LLCs and had 300 bank accounts. His house was valued at $1.7 million; he had BMWs and Mercedes and possibly a boat. Yet he claimed to have nothing.\nBondholders are calculating their losses. They could get repaid for a piece of their investment through bankruptcy; for example, if four of Crown\u2019s New Orleans properties sell at a profit, bondholders would get up to 30 percent of the proceeds.\nBut some aren\u2019t counting on anything. One bondholder, Thompson IM Funds, marked the value of its $7 million investment to $4.2 million in May.\nTo hear Silber tell it, it was all just paper \u2014 the wealth and the debt.\n\u201cMoney and material wealth do not define who we are,\u201d Silber told the court before his sentencing, arguing he was a changed man. \u201cTrue fulfillment comes from serving others. Somewhere along the way,\u201d he added, \u201cI lost sight of what truly mattered. I let money and a deal take priority over everything.\u201d",

        "content": "There are yellow cabs honking and ambulances wailing, but the streets of Midtown East still feel quiet on a Friday evening, just a few minutes before 6 p.m.\nNear Grand Central Terminal, a chaos of commuters descends to the subway and train, skirting the tourists. But within a few blocks, the sidewalks begin to thin out, until it\u2019s just office workers in their khakis, button-downs and puffer jackets, briefcases in hand or backpacks slung over their shoulders.\nMore workers emerge from the new\nJPMorgan headquarters\non Park Avenue. A man in a suit (without a tie) and a woman in gray exit through the revolving door, the first steps of their commutes scored by the rattling of a construction elevator on the side of the tower.\nA few blocks away, on Third Avenue, the mix shifts to show signs of residential life. A woman jogs down the sidewalk. A couple is out for an evening walk, their baby in a stroller. A little girl in light-up sneakers rides her pink and purple scooter. But their leisurely start to the weekend is at odds with the less-homey ground-floor spots that populate the nearby blocks: a CVS Pharmacy, FedEx and Starbucks. A man dines alone in a Just Salad, while another has a solo glass of wine in a window seat at La Botaniste.\nOn Second Avenue, walking uptown from the former Pfizer headquarters on East 42nd Street, it\u2019s harder to classify the crowd. A woman pushes her small dog in a stroller. A young couple wearing sweats carries a box of pizza home. A man, seemingly fresh from the gym in basketball shorts and a sweatshirt and toting two Trader Joe\u2019s bags, walks past the Westside Market. A group of teenagers in leather jackets pass around a vape.\nThe blend of Friday evening ramblers signals a neighborhood in transition. Once an aging\noffice district\n, Midtown East is on its way to becoming what one business development organization leader in the area dubbed a 24/7 live-work-play community, where employees walk between their offices and apartments, pausing for sit-down dinners or popping into ground-floor retail spots along the way.\nIt\u2019s a vision of ideal Manhattan living that hasn\u2019t historically been synonymous with Midtown, an area long associated with tourist-filled crowds and one that many New Yorkers joke about avoiding at all costs.\nBut that reputation is one developers are betting won\u2019t hold. Some of the city\u2019s biggest names in\nconversions\n, like Nathan Berman\u2019s MetroLoft and the\nVanbarton Group\n, are turning their attention to the area, planning thousands of new apartments as new office towers boost foot traffic. Multifamily developers bill the added commercial development as a boon for their prospects, raising some brokers\u2019 hopes for prices per square foot reached by the projects.\n\u201cWhen you think of everything that\u2019s been happening along Park Avenue and near Grand Central, this is going to feed right off of that,\u201d said Joey Chilelli, a principal at Vanbarton, which is converting an office building on East 43rd Street into 400 apartments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these new corporate headquarters going on, major employers and major investment. What better opportunity to deliver high-quality product and tap into those residents who work in those corporate offices.\u201d\nA\nneighborhood evolves\nRob Byrnes has worked with the East Midtown Partnership for more than 20 years.\nIn his time with the nonprofit, which is geared toward improving the district stretching from Second Avenue to Madison Avenue between East 48th and East 63rd streets, he estimates that he\u2019s seen the population of the corridor increase fourfold.\nOn top of that growth, the population is set for a likely influx of new residents once a wave of new development projects across\u00a0 the neighborhood \u2014 and dotted along its periphery \u2014 is completed. Among them is MetroLoft\u2019s massive conversion of the former Pfizer Building, which itself is expected to deliver roughly 1,500 units.\nThe neighborhood is also undergoing an infusion of commercial development, thanks to a re-zoning in 2017 aimed at replacing crumbling office buildings with shiny skyscrapers. JP Morgan plans to house 10,000 of its employees in its brand new tower, which opened last month. Earlier this year, CBRE inked a lease for 64,000 square feet at the all-glass Lever House after its $100 million renovation.\nAs Midtown East builds its residential contingent, it could extend the boundaries of such adjacent neighborhoods as the Upper East Side, blurring the lines between where one ends and the other begins. It\u2019s a shift that\u2019s already happening across the borough, which some say has increasingly become more homogenous, shedding the defining character and stereotypes that once ruled its neighborhoods.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not as differentiated as they used to feel when I moved here in the late \u201980s,\u201d fashion designer Thom Browne told the Wall Street Journal, referring to a migration of downtown businesses, including his own brand, to uptown neighborhoods like the Upper East Side.\nMidtown East hasn\u2019t quite reached its final form yet. It\u2019s still largely a commercial district catering to office workers, building staff and commuters coming and going from Grand Central. Fast casual restaurants serving office workers still dominate the food scene, although it\u2019s gradually attracting a more trendy crop of after-hours dining options, including such spots as the downtown Italian restaurant Rosemary\u2019s, which opened on Third Avenue and East 50th Street last year.\nWhat plays out in Midtown East \u2014 from apartment rental rates to new business investment \u2014 could also serve as a testing ground for Midtown South, which just had its own rezoning approved earlier this year and already has its first conversion project on deck. The blocks surrounding the Garment District aren\u2019t slated for the type of office developments going up in the nearby area, but the emerging residential district will likely benefit from New Yorkers warming up to Midtown as a desirable place to live.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the big sell\u201d for the Garment District, said Robert Rahmanian, co-CEO of Real NY, the firm heading leasing at CSC Real Estate\u2019s conversion on 300 East 42nd Street.\nRahmanian added that most of the projects the team is working on are in largely commercial areas, which he described as \u201cnot at the moment places where people want to live.\u201d\nBut what those conversions may lack in trendy locations, they gain in square footage. Carving up office floor plates into apartments that meet the city\u2019s code requirements is like solving a \u201cRubix Cube,\u201d Rahmanian said, which means units are often larger than others in equivalent new development buildings, A unit listed as a studio at a conversion may have interior rooms that make it feel more like a one- or two-bedroom.\nL\nife after rezoning\nMidtown East got the green light for a makeover in 2017.\nThat August, the City Council approved a rezoning of 78 blocks in the neighborhood, a move that paved the way for developers to replace old office buildings with newer, taller towers in exchange for contributing to public infrastructure funds.\nThe measure was a hard-fought one, arising from concerns that the eastern edge of Manhattan\u2019s leading business district would fall behind other areas such as Hudson Yards, which had been injected with shiny corporate headquarters and high-end retail in the years prior.\nAt the time of the rezoning, the city identified 16 sites ripe for a turnaround. Since then, seven of them have undergone or are in line for major alterations, The Real Deal\u2019s analysis shows. Three of those buildings will yield a combined 1,700 residential units.\nBut the rezoning came at a tricky time for the office market \u2014 not just in Manhattan, but across the world. Just three years after the rezoning approval, the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered offices, and in the years immediately after, a new attitude toward in-person working threatened to keep office workers at home more often, if not permanently.\nYet the move to revamp the office stock in Midtown East still appears to be paying off, if JPMorgan\u2019s massive new headquarters \u2014 and elimination of most work-from-home options \u2014 is any indication.\nThe pandemic \u201ccertainly presented a moment of uncertainty, but what we have seen is a strong rebound that has continued unabated,\u201d said Dan Garodnick, City Planning Commission chair and the Council member who spearheaded the 2017 rezoning effort. \u201cIt is proving to be the plan we\u2019d hoped it would be.\u201d\nAlthough the events of 2020 may not have deterred office development in the district, it did put the idea of more residential development on the minds of some of those in charge. Byrnes of the East Midtown Partnership, who was on the steering committee for the 2017 rezoning, said it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that he seriously considered trying to incentivize more residential development in the area.\n\u201cIt was clear in the first years of the pandemic that we needed a residential population to sustain ground-floor businesses,\u201d Byrnes said.\nByrnes wasn\u2019t alone in drawing that conclusion. Developers also caught on, jumping on opportunities to convert aging office buildings into residential apartments, aided in the following years by a series of tax abatements under 467m that made conversions especially attractive.\nIn a report published in July, City Comptroller Brad Lander estimated that more than 4,000 residential units have been created from conversions in Midtown East since 2020.\nSome of this development occurred within the bounds of the area selected for the Midtown East commercial rezoning. Since 2017, more than 3,500 residential units have been added in the zone or are in the pipeline, according to an analysis by TRD.\nThen at the end of last year, the City Council passed the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a city-wide zoning amendment that eased restrictions on conversions, moving the year of office eligibility from 1961 to 1990. Since then, developers have been snapping up buildings in the area, with more plans to convert on the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Platinum Properties Co-Founder, Khashy Eyn, referring to the Pfizer building conversion. \u201cIf Nathan Berman is going somewhere, a lot more people will follow.\u201d\nSome liken the budding transformation to the Financial District, where thousands of apartments have been converted from office buildings. Indeed, developers have taken cues from the neighborhood that was a testing ground for the conversion math and Jenga-like division required to make a project pencil out. Major conversions such as 25 Water Street proved that office-to-residential projects could be lucrative.\nMidtown East is, in many respects, an entirely different story. First, the wave of residential development is coinciding with an influx of office development, while the Financial District focused on residential only. Plus, Midtown East is a more established neighborhood than the Financial District, which is only just now seeing an uptick in the kind of retail and restaurant space necessary to sustain a neighborhood.\n\u201cMidtown is ahead of where FiDi was,\u201d Eyn said.\nEyn pushed back against the idea that people would shy away from living in Midtown East because of the hustle and bustle associated with the corridor.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get very healthy, high rents in these Midtown East buildings,\u201d Eyn said. \u201cManhattan is Manhattan. If you want to live in a residential neighborhood, I get it if you go to the West Village or Greenwich Village, but everywhere else you have a mix.\u201d",

        "content": "For New York\u2019s real estate players, the financing drought may finally be ending.\nAfter two years of sharp contraction, real estate lending is showing\nsigns of life.\nThe top 20 lenders doled out a combined $23 billion in loans over the past 12 months, up 60 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. Credit started to flow again as property markets stabilized and new state tax incentives went into effect.\nJPMorgan Chase retained its place at the top of the rankings, with almost $4 billion in loans, up from $2.1 billion a year ago and well ahead of the competition. Wells Fargo held onto second place with about $2.7 billion in new lending, up from $1.4 billion. Citibank climbed to third, more than doubling its total to nearly $2.7 billion.\nTraditional banks continued to dominate, but a handful of alternative and nonbank lenders surged into the ranks. Bank of Montreal leapt onto the list with more than $1 billion, up over 540 percent from the prior year, while Madison Realty Capital cracked the top 10, with nearly $1 billion in loans. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Financial Corporation, which did not appear on last year\u2019s list, recorded a 17-fold increase in loan volume.\n\u201cOverall, the real estate sector has had a tough three or four years, so I think there\u2019s finally a perception that we\u2019re closer to the bottom than not.\u201d\nJosh Zegen, Madison Realty Capital\n\u201cThere were a few unique opportunities this year, and in general there was a little more clarity, which led to more activity in New York City,\u201d said Josh Zegen of Madison Realty Capital, citing the extension of the construction completion deadline for 421a projects and the adoption of the 467m tax abatement on office-to-residential conversions as a key driver in the firm\u2019s $720 million loan for the former Pfizer headquarters building in Midtown East. \u201cOverall, the real estate sector has had a tough three or four years, so I think there\u2019s finally a perception that we\u2019re closer to the bottom than not.\u201d\nTo assess the industry\u2019s biggest lenders in New York City real estate,\nTRD\nexamined mortgages recorded in city records from August 2024 through July 2025 compared with the year before.\nThe rankings only include documents classified as mortgages \u2014 not those recorded as \u201cagreements\u201d \u2014 in city property records. The total number of loans issued by the top 20 lenders was up 11 percent from a year earlier, according to the data. (The ranking does not include some of the year\u2019s blockbuster refinancings, including the $2.85 billion\nCMBS loan\nfor Tishman Speyer and Henry Crown\u2019s Hudson Yards\noffice\ntower, The Spiral.)\nDespite the strong year, not all lenders are rushing back into the market. Valley National Bank, last year\u2019s third-place lender, saw its total plunge nearly 40 percent to about $750 million. Deutsche Bank\u2019s lending dropped by a similar margin, to just over $530 million.\nThe largest lending deal during the time period tracked by\nTRD\nwas the $1.15 billion refi of Steve Witkoff and Len Blavatnik\u2019s\nOne High Line\ncondo project, provided by JPMorgan and Tyko Capital. Corebridge Institutional Investments provided the second-largest loan, $561 million, to Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green and Marc Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management for the office-to-residential conversion of\n5 Times Square\n.\nTriple-digit deals doubled, from 60 to 129, year-over-year. The multifamily sector accounted for the largest share of new financing deals citywide, while office lending remained muted, except for Class A trophy towers, as landlords and lenders continued to navigate refinancing challenges.\nA year ago, dealmaking was stymied by steep borrowing costs. But landlords who were trying to tread water finally caught a break in September, when the Fed announced its 25-point rate cut.\nA surge in mixed-use and residential projects fueled lending for such multifamily lenders as S3 Capital Partners, which almost doubled its lending dollars year-over-year.\n\u201cThere are brisk sales in the boroughs, rents have been strong in most core areas, [and] everyone\u2019s whispering about the rates,\u201d said S3 Capital\u2019s Shawn Safdie. \u201cI think when you put that all in a blender, developers are optimistic by trade; otherwise, take your ball and go home. And so they\u2019re really playing it, and we\u2019re happy to finance it.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "November brings big changes for some of\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s markets.\nNew York City begins\nsaying goodbye to Mayor Eric Adams\n, who dropped his reelection bid in September after months of trailing in the polls.\nIn the final stretch of the mayoral election, Democratic nominee and frontrunner Zohran Mamdani made his case to business crowds, assuring that alongside his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants, he\u2019s also looking to fix the city\u2019s property tax system and help landlords reduce costs.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who\u2019s running as an independent, has promised to build 500,000 units, in part by overhauling the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. He has repeatedly said he would initiate construction of these \u201csimultaneously,\u201d raising questions about capacity and available subsidies.\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, resisted increasing calls for him to drop out of the race to give Cuomo a better chance of beating Mamdani. Sliwa has touted his opposition to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the centerpiece of the Adams\u2019 administration\u2019s housing agenda, which included several zoning changes aimed at making housing construction easier in the city.\nFour of the six\nballot measures\nin New York also focus on streamlining housing and other land use-related approval processes. Three of those questions have proven highly controversial and are seen by the City Council as a threat to members\u2019 authority over development in their districts. Some of the questions would remove the City Council\u2019s vote on certain projects that go through the city\u2019s land use review process, and one of the measures would create an appeals board that could override the Council\u2019s rejections of housing projects.\nA whopping 13 candidates are vying for [mayor of Miami], with six political veterans who seemingly have the upper hand\nover the seven newcomers. As of print time, there isn\u2019t a clear frontrunner.\nOne of the questions asks voters if local elections should be moved to even years, coinciding with presidential elections. Another proposal, if approved, would change the state constitution to retroactively allow ski trails in the Olympic Sports Complex in Essex County. As a condition of approval, the state must add 2,500 acres of protected forest land to Adirondack Park.\nMiami is also getting a new mayor, after a state court\nruled\nin July that the city cannot delay its elections by one year. The City Commission had voted to move elections to even years, which would have meant one more year in office for Mayor Francis Suarez, who is term-limited out of office.\nA whopping 13 candidates are\nvying\nfor Suarez\u2019s job, with six political veterans who seemingly have the upper hand over the seven newcomers. As of print time, there isn\u2019t a clear frontrunner.\nReal estate donors\nhave thrown support behind Miami City Commissioner Joe Carollo and Miami-Dade County Commissioner Eileen Higgins. Some prominent developers have also contributed to the campaigns of ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and former city commissioners Ken Russell and Alex Diaz de la Portilla.\nMeanwhile, in Miami Beach, Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez is challenging Mayor Steven Meiner. Airbnb investor Brian Ehrlich is competing for Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s commissioner seat, as is Daniel Ciraldo, former executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League. Attorney Monique Pardo-Pope and realtor Ava Frankel are also running.\nAnother real estate investor, Fred Karlton, is challenging Commissioner Laura Dominguez for her seat.\nIn Bexar County, Texas, the November ballot will determine whether the county should increase its hotel occupancy tax to help fund a new arena for the San Antonio Spurs and to redevelop the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo grounds. Two proposals seek to use that increase, as well as revenue from an extended rental car tax, to provide $311 million toward the arena and $197 million toward the grounds.\nConsequential races are on the horizon next year for some of\nTRD\n\u2019s other markets as well, and lines are being drawn. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is up for reelection, and some challengers are already getting in the race. Developer Rick Caruso, a persistent critic of Bass, has left the door open to challenging the mayor next year or running for governor. Real estate players have also donated to Antonio Villaraigosa\u2019s bid to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker launched his reelection bid in June, although he has not ruled out a run for president in 2028.\n\u2014\nFrancisco Alvarado,\u00a0Lauren Elkies Schram and Isaiah Mitchell contributed reporting",

        "content": "Over the last year, as the New York City office market saw a resurgence, the big players made a flurry of deals. One was 2 Park Avenue, which\ntraded\nto Haddad Brands for $357 million. A few blocks away, 250 Park\ntraded\nfor $320 million. Office-to-residential conversions, meanwhile, spurred transactions in quieter commercial centers, like at 77 Water Street,\nwhich was sold\nto Vanbarton for about $95 million.\nLawyers played a crucial role in getting those deals across the finish line for the marquee names who made them, doing a lot more than handling the paperwork.\nThe Real Deal ranked law firms by dollar volume of closed sales in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, between Aug. 1, 2024, of last year and July 31, 2025. In total,\nTRD\nanalyzed nearly 41,000 commercial and residential sales in New York, totaling more than $80.2 billion.\nFried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson took the top spot at $3.2 billion in just 42 deals. The firm nearly tripled its volume, as measured by\nTRD\n, from last year to this year.\nA reenergized real estate climate certainly had a hand in that. But the firm instead touted its long-running relationships in the industry as the key to growth.\n\u201cEven though New York is a big city, in terms of complex, big transactions, you tend to see the same people over and over again,\u201d Jonathan Mechanic, co-chairman of Fried Frank\u2019s real estate department, said. The firm frequently represents JP Morgan, Blackstone and RXR, among others.\nFor example, the morning before an interview with TRD, Mechanic had a meeting with a lender and a borrower. Although he was representing the borrower that day, he had previously represented the lender. That gave the whole interaction an additional level of trust.\n\u201cThere are a lot of lawyers who may be good technical lawyers out there,\u201d said Michael Werner, Fried Frank\u2019s other co-chair. \u201cBut it\u2019s the relationships that you have with folks around the table that really facilitate getting a complicated deal done quickly, efficiently and fairly.\u201d\nA rising market\nThe rise in office sales benefited other big commercial firms as well. Greenberg Traurig nearly doubled its deal count, from 10 to 18, and tripled its volume, surging 32 spots from last year\u2019s ranking to this year\u2019s list.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing competitive bidding on assets that are for sale, which we hadn\u2019t seen since pre-Covid,\u201d Stephen Rabinowitz, co-chair of the firm\u2019s real estate practice at Greenberg Traurig, said.\nBeyond the sales volume, commercial lawyers often spend a good deal of time on loan workouts, negotiating new terms for a borrower when things haven\u2019t gone according to plan. Although interest rate declines have helped, they haven\u2019t solved borrowers\u2019 problems.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of distressed debt working its way through the system,\u201d Rabinowitz said.\nIn the residential world, interest rate declines have also been meaningful.\n\u201cThe sheer news of the interest rate [decline] or the feeling that it\u2019s going to go down or keep further going down has already spurred a huge significant uptick in my recent volume,\u201d Jeremy Wang, principal at Yeung &amp; Wang, said. The firm completed 599 deals during the year.\nChanges to the financing landscape also resulted in more lending on the residential side. Not long ago, about 70 percent of the residential deals Romer Debbas worked on were cash deals \u2014 now that number has come down to about 50 percent, said Michael Romer, the firm\u2019s managing partner.\n\u201cWe closed more large residential transactions this year than we have in past years and that\u2019s a positive sign showing that there\u2019s movement, showing that investors are comfortable investing in our market,\u201d Romer said. The firm took the second spot in the overall rankings with 482 deals.\nThose economic and cultural conditions have also changed how residential buyers approach sales. Beyond paperwork, a resi attorney\u2019s job can involve a fair amount of emotional management.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more, in my experience, hand-holding,\u201d said Sharon Darouvar, of Konner Gershburg Melnick Darouvar, which sits third on the list. \u201cBuyers are more cautious about making a purchase, but it\u2019s a lot more: How do you feel about this? Are you confident in the diligence? Are you comfortable with the terms and representations of the contract?\u201d\nA changing landscape\nLaw may be one of the more traditional professions, but it\u2019s already being upended by new technologies.\nFor some, AI is the driving force. The attorneys at Greenberg Traurig do work for major non-real estate companies. Those firms are already using artificial intelligence in some of their work and have begun asking for AI solutions from their legal teams. Greenberg Traurig is now beginning to use an in-house AI system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an additional person there to check your writing, check for internal inconsistencies,\u201d Rabinowitz said. \u201cEven that has already started to have an impact. It gives us an opportunity to feel a lot more confident in the precision of the work we\u2019re producing.\u201d\nTechnology is also affecting lawyers\u2019 work in more subtle ways. Just the process of getting documents signed is now seeing less friction.\n\u201cI would say the norm in Manhattan now is not to have a live closing,\u201d said Wang.\nBut these developments are unlikely to change some things. New York still mandates legal representation for buyers and sellers in every real estate transfer.\nWhen the next big deal comes down the pike, New York\u2019s attorneys will be there to grab it.\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "How big is too big?\nProperty managers ranked below FirstService Residential have eagerly been asking that question, as the city\u2019s top firm by size has gobbled up the competition in recent years. In 2023, it acquired Charles H. Greenthal &amp; Co. and Tudor Realty Services Corp. and in 2021, FirstService added Midboro Management and its roughly 15,000 units.\nThis year, FirstService retained its top spot on\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s property management rankings for a fourth\nstraight year\n, but the vultures have been circling. FirstService saw its unit count fall by over 20,000 from last year to this year, according to the rankings.\nTRD\nanalyzed the number of units under management as of Sept. 30, 2025, using building data from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development from all five boroughs.\nIn some ways, FirstService\u2019s position is more a paper crown after long-time silver medalist AKAM acquired Metro Management Development and its more than 40,000 units in February. The two firms will maintain distinct brand identities and continue to report totals separately, but the combined entity would surpass FirstService.\nAKAM CEO Ken Greene said that the deal for Metro, which specializes in Mitchell-Lama properties, made sense as a complement to AKAM\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to cut costs by consolidating,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking to do is to add \u2014 to invest money in programs that add value to a board and property that will lead to economic benefit.\u201d\nThough FirstService maintained its top rank, a number of new issues confronted the industry, including new rental laws, an increase in competition for units and soaring costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be hard for the smaller players to really compete.\u201d\nKen Greene, AKAM\nFirstService\u2019s newly named president Marc Kotler attributed the drop in his company\u2019s unit count to normal market adjustments and some asset sales in the rental world, but he declined to provide specific numbers on how those factors played into the company\u2019s results this year.\nFor others, the\noffice-to-residential conversion boom\nhas been a boon for growth. A report from the city found that there have been 44 conversion projects started since 2020 that, once completed, are expected to deliver over 17,000 new units to the city \u2014 and to property managers that know how to handle them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been advising, supporting, helping [and] in some cases, walking buildings with other owners or developers,\u201d Rose Associates\u2019 Scott Marino said. His firm helped bring Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft\u2019s 571-unit conversion of Goldman Sachs\u2019 former office at 55 Broad to market.\nDevelopers or landowners eyeing conversions often enlist property managers to help understand the minutiae, from how to convert HVAC or electrical systems to rejiggering trash-collection systems originally geared around reams of office paper, according to Marino.\nCarving out a niche like conversions may prove to be the way forward for the boutique firms remaining in the city, as the large players continue to take advantage of their economies of scale and resources.\nJust weeks ago, Douglas Elliman Property Management, which placed third in this year\u2019s rankings,\nwas sold\nto Associa, one of the largest property managers in the country.\nGreene, who last year boasted about AKAM\u2019s ability to take advantage of M&amp;A turmoil by offering superior service, slightly changed his tune this year about what AKAM can offer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be hard for the smaller players to really compete,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some of those companies that are really well run, that have built up great reputations and have great founders, and we\u2019d love them to become part of AKAM.\u201d\nCost problems\nThe biggest shakeup for landlords, large and small, came from the FARE Act passage this year, which required building owners, rather than would-be renters, to pay broker fees.\nBut the top property managers downplayed the impact of the new law on their management operations, noting that it was just another piece of the compliance puzzle.\nKotler said most owners working with FirstService were already paying the brokerage fees, and for those that weren\u2019t, it was just a matter of updating budgets.\n\u201cWe completed a digital audit of all of our websites,\u201d Rose Associates\u2019 Marino said, adding that the focus was just on ensuring fees, like a $20 application charge, were listed on all of the company\u2019s websites.\nThe bigger issue, as it has been in years past, has been navigating the interminable runup in costs, driven by regulations, utilities and insurance.\n\u201cCosts on insurance are just simply out of line, and we need to figure it out,\u201d Marino said.\nWhile insurance costs have risen across the country, the number one culprit in the city is umbrella insurance policies for co-ops and condos that have ballooned by as much as 50 percent, driven by New York\u2019s strict liability laws, according to FirstService Residential\u2019s annual high-rise report.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reevaluated the need for some of those huge umbrella numbers that you\u00a0 had historically when you basically were given it for free, and a real discussion of what is really an appropriate amount of umbrella,\u201d said Orsid New York president Neil Davidowitz.\nThis year also marked the first time fines could be levied under Local Law 97, which requires buildings to hit certain carbon emission thresholds. While some buildings managed to stay below the mandated thresholds for 2025, property managers are already looking ahead to subsequent years, when more stringent requirements will be in place.\n\u201cThe vast, vast, vast majority of our 265 buildings were not exposed to fines for this year,\u201d Davidowitz said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t make changes, there is a potential exposure for fines in 2030.\u201d\nThe number of cost drivers has only grown in recent years, forcing property managers and boards to take a more hands-on approach than they have in the past.\n\u201cI think boards are very quickly realizing you need to cut that long-term plan,\u201d Century Management CEO A.J. Rexhepi said. \u201cYou need to put together funds on an annual basis for long-term capital planning.\u201d\nFor the industry\u2019s heavyweights, cost-saving solutions have come from economies of scale, something they hope can be a competitive advantage.\n\u201cWe have an insurance expert and we have an energy expert on staff,\u201d AKAM\u2019s Greene said. \u201c\u2019We\u2019re able to get certain expense items lower than most management companies because we\u2019re using our scale.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Gov. Ron DeSantis asked Floridians a big question earlier this year.\n\u201cYou buy a home, pay off a mortgage\u2014and yet you still have to write a check to the government every year just to live on your own property?\u201d he said in his State of the State speech. \u201cIs the property yours or are you just renting from the government?\u201d\nThe line of questioning resonated with the state\u2019s homeowners, who have watched their carrying costs rise as higher property assessments have added to their tax burden at the same time that\ninsurance premiums\nhave risen and \u2014 for\ncondo\nunit owners especially \u2014 fees have piled on.\nBrokers likewise began to imagine a world where their clients didn\u2019t balk after a preview of their tax bill. Would-be buyers are often surprised when the value of a property has gone up substantially since its last sale, triggering a big levy. The state already limits annual tax increases for owners.\nIn any event, the tax bills from higher valuations hadn\u2019t just put pressure on residents, the governor said. They had also created \u201ca gusher of revenue for local governments,\u201d some of whose budgets had increased \u201cfar beyond the growth in population.\u201d\nDuring the ensuing months, state house representatives and senators looked to see if the\npush could become a reality\n. House Speaker Daniel Perez created the Select Committee on Property Taxes, whose efforts yielded seven joint resolutions and a bill; if passed by House, Senate and voters, they could add several new exemptions to an existing list of property tax relief, much of which is focused on homesteaded properties, or primary residences.\nBut so far, Gov. DeSantis isn\u2019t going for the half steps, no matter how researched. \u201cPlacing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,\u201d he said on X.\nAs local representatives duke out with the governor,\nThe Real Deal\nasked industry and political insiders to get into the philosophical and practical details in The Debate. State Rep. Vicki Lopez, co-chair of the House Select Committee on Property Taxes, believes voters should decide the issue, while Dora Puig, broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, wants to preserve features that make communities attractive to residents and buyers before changing the tax structure.\nState Rep. Vicki Lopez\nSince May, when the Florida House Speaker created our property tax committee, we\u2019ve been meeting and gathering information from all 37 representatives across both parties, rural communities and big urban areas.\nWhat we\u2019ve learned has been eye-opening. We say \u201ctaxes,\u201d but what homeowners pay is truly a fee for services. Right now, all three types of property owners \u2014 non-homestead residential, homestead residential and commercial \u2014 pay for police, fire, solid waste, water and sewer, infrastructure and other services.\nThe governor has told voters that anyone who owns a homestead property should have their property taxes totally eliminated. But this raises an interesting philosophical question: Why should commercial properties and non-homestead residential properties have to pay for those services but not those who own homestead properties?\nThere is already a fear that commercial property owners would be hit with new fees by local governments, and that this could put a burden on businesses, especially owners with rental properties.\nIn Key Biscayne, which runs a very lean budget, homestead property taxes total $11 million, and half goes to public safety. If you eliminate these particular property taxes, then who will pick up the costs? It is estimated that half of the 411 municipalities in the state might have to fold back into counties. Can counties absorb all the new residents and the corresponding services?\nThe House decided: Why don\u2019t we trust the voters to decide how to tax themselves?\u00a0 All our proposals require no decrease in funding for police and exclude school taxes. One proposal eliminates homestead property taxes while another one does so over a 10-year period of time, which gives a longer runway to make budget adjustments. The third would completely eliminate non-school taxes for anyone 65 and over who resides in a homestead property.\nWe\u2019re also proposing new exemptions that would benefit new homeowners and help people downsize. One would eliminate the $500,000 cap on portability, so you could transfer the entire exemption even if the home has a lesser value, and we\u2019ll let married couples combine their Save Our Home benefits. Another limits the growth in assessed value to 3 percent over three years for homestead properties, and 5 percent per year for non-homestead properties instead of the current 10 percent.\nWe also have a legislative bill that requires local governments to pass any increase in millage rates \u2014 the amount of tax per $1,000 of assessed property value \u2014 by a two-thirds vote.\nThere was talk from DOGE efforts that there\u2019s lots of waste in government and we can eliminate property tax with no effect. But of our 67 counties, 29 are fiscally constrained, and we already subsidize them because of the lack of a tax base.\nOnce the proposals are passed in the House they will be sent to the Senate for their review.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know yet where the Senate is on this. Whatever both decide will go to the voters as constitutional amendments in the November 2026 general election. We don\u2019t know what those amendments will be, but property tax reform is coming, along with intended and unintended consequences.\n\u2014\nAs told to TRD\nDora Puig\nBroker and owner of Luxe Living Realty\nAs a luxury real estate professional in South Florida, I meet or speak with multiple clients daily, and lately many conversations circle back to the same concern: property taxes. For most international buyers who don\u2019t have such high property taxes, it is an issue for them to wrap their heads around it.\nA state push to eliminate property taxes for Floridians sounds appealing, but we must ensure Floridians aren\u2019t left with dangerous funding gaps.\nNew Yorkers and Californians flee to Florida, Texas and Tennessee specifically because we don\u2019t have state income tax. When you\u2019re already paying 40 percent federally, adding California\u2019s 13.3 percent state tax becomes unbearable. It\u2019s one of the reasons our real estate market is booming.\nI\u2019ve lost sales to clients on account of high property taxes, so in theory, I see how this is a good idea. But there has to be a real plan to pay the bills of the state of Florida. I want to make sure we have police, schools that are good, firefighters, and streets that are clean first.\nTo my recollection, the property tax conversation started when the Champlain Towers South condo tower collapsed, exposing a crisis in aging condominium buildings. The reserve requirements in some condominiums have increased by up to 50 percent, insurance costs have exploded and, suddenly, older residents on fixed incomes couldn\u2019t afford their homes. For example, I know of condominium buildings that have needed to syndicate with up to five insurance companies just to obtain insurance. The elderly tend to move out of their houses because they are too tedious to maintain, and move into condominiums because the lifestyle is easier. Now they are finding themselves with very high condominium maintenance fees and special assessments that are difficult to keep up with.\nThere\u2019s genuine appeal to rewarding primary residents who live here 12 months a year, maintain our communities, and contribute year-round. Eliminating property tax for these homesteaded properties while maintaining it for investment properties could create a powerful incentive for permanent residency and convert renters and young people into first-time home buyers.\nThis wouldn\u2019t solve everything. I\u2019ve personally lost sales to European clients who balk at our property taxes when they\u2019re accustomed to paying very little annually back home.\nFlorida is typically run with a surplus, but we still have hurricanes we cannot control, aging infrastructure requiring billions in upgrades and insurance companies threatening to abandon the state entirely. We cannot cut property taxes at the expense of essential services or disaster preparedness.\nThe question isn\u2019t whether eliminating homestead property taxes is desirable\u2026 Obviously, it is. The big thing is, can we make the numbers work? Can we cover our bills throughout the state of Florida? Can we maintain the quality of life that attracts people here in the first place?\nI think we should see the complete financial picture first. Show us how we continue to fund schools, maintain emergency services and handle storms without collateral damage to the things that make Florida exceptional. Get the math right, and this bold reform could cement Florida\u2019s competitive advantage for generations.\n\u2014\nAs told to TRD",

        "content": "In the gold rush that is real estate development in West Palm Beach, nothing is more valuable than the dirt on waterfront Flagler Drive.\nBut there is no vacant land left for sale. Aging condos inhabit the remaining development sites, their boards controlled by unit owners with differing opinions on the fate of their tropical escapes. As they try to woo these often mercurial sellers, South Florida\u2019s richest developers are also fighting each other for the last pieces of West Palm Beach\u2019s rich waterfront and the chance to leave their mark on the future skyline of \u201cWall Street South.\u201d\nBillionaires have been snapping up sites along the road for years, among them Jorge P\u00e9rez, Jeff Greene and Wayne Huizenga Jr. (of the Blockbuster and Waste Management fortune).\nNamed for the Standard Oil magnate credited as the grandfather of modern Florida, Flagler Drive starts at the South End and stretches the length of the city\u2019s Intracoastal Waterway frontage to a dead end at the border with Riviera Beach. The street and its city emerged from the pandemic triumphant, with a new flock of wealthy residents and finance sector office tenants.\nDevelopers responded in kind,\nplanning thousands of condo units,\nprimarily along the Flagler Drive corridor.\nAfter devouring the few vacant patches of land, they turned their attention to the aging condo buildings on the waterfront. In the aftermath of the Champlain Towers collapse, the state passed condo safety laws that trapped many older condos in financial binds. It was open season. Sources say nearly every building along Flagler Drive\u2019s waterfront has fielded offers from developers. Every firm has their own courtship style in these deals \u2014 some forward, some coy \u2014 but they all want the same thing. The land.\nQ\nuiet luxury\nAmong the firms that take a more covert approach is Perko Development, a Jupiter-based team led by Phil Perko. Perko prefers to enter a building quietly, cordially, so as not to spook the sellers or alert the competition to his whereabouts. After orchestrating buyouts, he partners with a more high-profile developer to plan a new condominium.\nHe followed this method on Jupiter Island in 2017, arranging the acquisition of Bowling Rock Club and partnering with Jeffery Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Development to build the 10-story, 21-unit SeaGlass. It sold out\nfor $168.8 million\nin 2023, with buyers who had C-suite titles from companies like Krispy Kreme, Major League Baseball and the crypto platform BitPay.\nAfter that success, Perko turned his attention to the West Palm Beach waterfront, this time in partnership with Kolter Group.\nThe pair honed in on Flagler House, a 38-unit waterfront condominium at 3705 South Flagler Drive. Built in 1985 on 1.4 acres, the majority of units have an estimated market value below $200,000, according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser\u2019s Office. When Perko and Kolter closed on their\n$37.6 million buyout\nof the building in May, prices for units ranged from $850,000 to $1.8 million, property records show. In its place, the developers plan an 18-story, 39-unit luxury condo of the same name. Sales have yet to launch and the developers declined to comment on pricing.\nIt was a deal done with little fanfare or public angst. Some sellers walked away having made their money back tenfold, illustrating the profit potential for condo owners along West Palm Beach\u2019s waterfront \u2014 that is, if they can reach the critical mass for voting consensus. This gets more challenging in larger buildings with a greater range of personalities and financial motives.\nT\nhe poison pill\n\u201cMost condo boards have what they call a \u2018poison pill,\u2019\u201d Serhant agent Christian Prakas said. He\u2019s referring to the Florida law that allows for 5 percent of a condo\u2019s total voting interest to block a condo termination, even if the remaining 95 percent are in support.\nThe poison pill has proven an effective defense against developers hoping to build anew on Flagler, including Al Adelson.\nAdelson completed The Bristol at 1100 South Flagler Drive in 2019. It is widely considered the premier condo tower in West Palm Beach, and sales frequently top $3,000 per square foot, a once unheard-of number in the city. Adelson is planning a second non-waterfront condo dubbed The Berkeley, but last year he was quietly shopping for a waterfront site.\nHe approached two adjacent buildings spanning 5.5 waterfront acres, La Fontana at 2800 North Flagler Drive and Portofino at 2600 North Flagler Drive, with an offer: $300 million for the pair. For the 140-unit La Fontanta, that averages to $1.1 million per unit, and it\u2019s $1.2 million per door for the 125-unit Portofino \u2014 far exceeding market value.\nBut the deal choked on the poison pill. La Fontana, a co-op with a lower termination threshold, was game, but Portofino\u2019s owners couldn\u2019t reach consensus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear the value of land continues to go up and up, but there comes a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth more than I offer.\u201d\nAl Adelson\n\u201cWhen you have more units, the more difficult it is to agree,\u201d Adelson said. In larger buildings, where there are 100 to 200 unit owners, \u201ceach of them has a vote, and [they can] range from very successful people financially to people who are living on their savings and Social Security. They have different financial needs.\u201d\nIn the case of La Fontana and Portofino, Adelson hit the upper limit on how much he was willing to sweeten the pot for opposing unit owners.\n\u201cThe sellers have not agreed to sell, which means there are other people they feel will pay more money,\u201d Adelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear the value of land continues to go up and up, but there comes a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth more than I offer.\u201d\nAfter the failed buyout, La Fontana\u2019s owners were still seeing dollar signs. The co-op tapped Serhant to market the building as a development site asking $200 million. Prakas confirmed the 10-story building is under contract to a developer for near the asking price, which would average out to $1.4 million per unit. He declined to confirm who\u2019s buying but said La Fontana received multiple offers from developers.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the highest, but it was the strongest,\u201d he said, adding that some of the offers were, like Adelson\u2019s, contingent upon the building to the south, Portofino at 2600 North Flagler Drive, also selling. \u201cWe\u2019re not confident in that happening.\u201d\nTo Prakas, the La Fontana sale holds lessons in an era of buyouts, terminations and rebirth.\n\u201cA co-op buyout is so much easier than a condo buyout,\u201d he said. Voting power is structured differently, and they are not as susceptible to the 5 percent poison pill, Prakas said.\nWhile the deal is still months from closing, La Fontana\u2019s buyout is a fairytale compared to the brutal battles playing out in neighboring buildings, where owners who bought $200,000 units decades ago find themselves in a legal tug-of-war between industry titans.\nT\nhe big boys in the sandbox\nHarbor Towers is a two-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive. It\u2019s one in a trio of waterfront sites on a prime 4.3-acre stretch of South Flagler Drive opposite the Intracoastal Waterway from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club. It\u2019s also close to the desirable El Cid and SoSo neighborhoods.\nAnd Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners and Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross have been dueling over it for the better part of a year.\nBy November of last year, Ashi had already secured the middle parcel, an apartment complex at 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive\nfor $20 million\n. Both developers had made offers on the third site, 60-unit Southbridge at 3915 South Flagler Drive, where Ross won out with a bid of $42 million, or $700,000 per unit. He started closing on units in December, although he hasn\u2019t completed the full buyout yet.\nWith flags planted in the other two sites, it came down to Harbor Towers. By April, sources say it was apparent that Ashi had secured the majority of units in Harbor Tower and was on the path to termination. In a last-ditch effort, Ross filed suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, accusing Ashi of playing dirty and demanding an injunction that would prevent termination. The suit also targeted Jessica Julian, the Douglas Elliman agent who helped Fort secure its majority of contracts. Representatives for Ross declined to comment on the litigation for this story.\n\u201cIt was a pretty normal block play,\u201d Glen Waldman, an attorney for Ashi, said. \u201cEvery time you have big boys playing in the sandbox, \u2026they fight, and that\u2019s what they do. They\u2019re not scared to fight.\u201d\nBy September, blades were drawn.\n\u201cThe only games being played here are by [Related] and its billionaire principal Stephen Ross,\u201d read a legal filing from the attorneys for Fort Partners, who in the same document called Ross\u2019 suit \u201cmeritless\u201d and his lawyers\u2019 latest tactics \u201ccomical.\u201d\nAshi\u2019s attorneys insisted Ross was stalling under the guise of nonexistent settlement talks, trying to block their efforts to depose him, a predictable move. Most billionaires try to avoid deposition.\n\u201cThere is no settlement,\u201d Ashi\u2019s attorneys declared in the filing. Waldman said the case was fairly straightforward and that Ashi had the numbers on his side.\n\u201cYou either have to bulldoze them, or settle with them,\u201d Waldman said, summarizing the strategy.\nAs of September, they both seemed poised to plow ahead. But why? Did Ross really want this site that much, or did he simply want to keep a rival off his turf?\nRepresentatives for Ross declined to comment on the suit. Whatever the reason, Adelson said, \u201cIt tells you how aggressive they feel they need to be to keep building in this market.\u201d\nK\nnock-out\nIn the end, they did settle. Terms of the deal are unclear, but Ashi is now in control of a slice of the city\u2019s precious waterfront. He\u2019ll be completing the termination of Harbor Towers.\nThe buyouts at Flagler House, La Fontana and Harbor Towers are merely the first few rounds in a years-long match-up between real estate\u2019s champion fighters, and between developers and unit owners.\n\u201cEventually, the economics are such that [developers] will be able to come to an agreement with most of the buildings on the water,\u201d Adelson said. \u201cIt may take a little while.\u201d\nSellers may also have to lower expectations, Prakas said. Other buildings have reached out to him and the Serhant team about buyout marketing, but they haven\u2019t pursued any deals yet.\n\u201cWhen we told them what we thought it was worth, they weren\u2019t as interested,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these buildings thought they were going to get twice the market value.\u201d\nAt the right price, there\u2019s money for all parties.\n\u201cThese owners were making so much money,\u201d Ashi\u2019s attorney Waldman said of the Harbor Towers deal. \u201cThere are no losers here.\u201d",

        "content": "Scott Sherman still remembers when landlords could get top dollar asking rents for retail and restaurant spaces on Lincoln Road, the outdoor pedestrian mall in Miami Beach.\n\u201cEight years ago, rents got ridiculous,\u201d Sherman, who leads Miami-based Torose Equities, told The Real Deal. \u201cThey went from $150 to $300-plus a foot. Restaurants fled, national brands downsized and the street lost its energy.\u201d\nSherman, who was among the landlords steering the Lincoln Road Business Improvement District in the 2010s, returned to the street last year after nearly a decade, paying $10.4 million for a two-story building at 910 Lincoln Road that\u2019s leased to AllSaints, a clothing store.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic and inflated rents reset everything. For the first time in years, the street\u2019s affordable enough for creative operators to come back.\u201d\nOnce Miami Beach\u2019s most famous pedestrian strip, Lincoln Road has spent the better part of the early 2020s trying to recover its footing. High rents, changing consumer tastes and the pandemic all gutted a corridor once teeming with national retailers and high-end restaurants. Now, some investors and commercial brokers are banking on the idea that a refreshed mix of restaurants, experiential tenants and lower rent expectations can again raise Lincoln Road\u2019s profile.\nSherman and other Lincoln Road experts see recent trades, such as retail and hospitality investor\nRobert Rivani\nbuying a building on the street (the former The Lincoln Theatre) that\u2019s leased to H&amp;M and other tenants, as the beginning of a long-overdue rebound.\n\u201cI think now is a good time to be getting in,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re gonna see it turn the corner and continue to get better over the next couple of years.\u201d\nR\netailers run\nLincoln Road\u2019s tumble as one of South Florida\u2019s prime retail streets began in 2016, when asking rental rates peaked at around $325 a square foot, according to David Abrams of the commercial brokerage Masonre.\n\u201cIt took a hard nosedive right before Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, Brickell, Design District, Wynwood \u2014 places where retail didn\u2019t really exist \u2014 started popping up. Tenants looking at the beach decided to go to these other neighborhoods.\u201d\nBrickell, Wynwood and the Design District are areas that have more people, more traffic, more density and more opportunities for top brands, noted Lyle Stern, CEO of Miami Beach-based Vertical Real Estate and president of the Lincoln Road Business Improvement District.\n\u201cLincoln Road certainly had its fair share of national tenants, and still has some,\u201d Stern said. \u201cBut one of the biggest issues is the perception of what Lincoln Road was. While some lament the Lincoln Road of yesteryear, the street is actually doing well.\u201d\nFor instance, the\noccupancy rate\non Lincoln Road is averaging 77 percent, and asking rents are around $150 to $225 a square foot, making the outdoor pedestrian mall competitive with such indoor malls as Brickell City Centre, Aventura Mall and Dadeland Mall, according to Stern.\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t vacancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe universe of tenants that want to be on Lincoln Road is pretty significant. Some are national. Some are international. Some are regional and some have anywhere from one to three stores in Miami-Dade, Broward or Palm Beach counties.\u201d\nStern said that Miami Beach\u2019s own transformation is helping drive the rebound. \u201cThe wealth in this community has grown massively,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween Lincoln Road and Faena, there\u2019s $4 billion worth of development underway \u2014 the Shore Club, the Raleigh, the Aman, the Ritz expansion. And the Grand Hyatt convention hotel [currently under construction] will change everything. It will bring year-round customers to restaurants and shops.\u201d\nL\nower rents, new reality\nSherman, Abrams, and Stern all agree that the key is balancing a good mix of local and national retailers and restaurants. \u201cThe old model \u2014 national tenants overpaying for exposure \u2014 doesn\u2019t work here anymore,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe real story is smaller, independent operators coming back in at rents they can handle.\u201d\nStern calls the current asking rent range \u201chealthy\u201d compared to the frothy pre-Covid years. \u201cWe\u2019re competitive again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unlike Brickell or Aventura, Lincoln Road is still the only true pedestrian high street in South Florida. People want to walk, dine and linger. That\u2019s the advantage.\u201d\nLessons from the boom-and-bust cycle are fueling smarter deals this time around, according to Abrams. \u201cWhen you remove the greed and reset expectations, you can plan for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about flipping a building \u2014 it\u2019s about curating the right mix.\u201d\nIn some cases, he added, retailers are opting to buy spaces on Lincoln Road because of the value. Abrams represented Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, the founders of Beverly Hills-based Alo Yoga, in their $17 million purchase of the former Walgreens at\n100 Lincoln Road\n. Harris and DeGeorge are converting the space into a flagship store and private wellness club.\nRobert Rivani\u2019s investment is also a boost. In addition to buying 551 Lincoln Road, the building housing H&amp;M, Rivani is in the middle of a $40 million renovation of a mixed-use office building at\n1691 Michigan Avenue\n, which is just off Lincoln Road. Over the summer, Rivani landed\nPlayboy\nas a penthouse tenant under a 10-year lease. The iconic brand plans to relocate from Beverly Hills contingent on the city of Miami Beach providing $800,000 in incentives.\nNew tenants signal confidence in Lincoln Road\u2019s recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see real movement,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cPlayboy moving its headquarters off Lincoln Road, Alo buying on the east end \u2014 those are dominoes falling in the right direction. The daytime population is coming back.\u201d\nFor Stephen DeMeo, a broker with Lee &amp; Associates, the fix isn\u2019t just about cheaper leases \u2014 it\u2019s about creativity. \u201cLincoln Road\u2019s lost its rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fill it with stale apparel retailers and expect excitement. It needs activation \u2014 pop-up stores, rooftop events, wellness studios [and] cultural tie-ins.\u201d\nThe future is experiential, not transactional, DeMeo argues. \u201cPeople want something to do, not just something to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a rooftop pickleball club, daily markets or a music series. Landlords should get flexible \u2014short-term deals, percentage rents, anything that keeps the block alive.\u201d\nDeMeo points to Rivani\u2019s building, where Playboy is planning a club and lounge, as examples of the vibe shift. \u201cThat kind of tenant brings cachet and curiosity, which Lincoln Road needs,\u201d DeMeo said. \u201cThe street has to feel like a scene again.\u201d",

        "content": "South Florida developers are increasingly looking to EB-5 funding to fill gaps in their capital stacks, as\nforeign investors\nrush to participate before the program expires.\nThe visa program, which provides green cards to investors and their immediate families whose funds lead to the creation of 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers, has a minimum threshold of $800,000 for investment in rural areas or areas with high unemployment. That goes up to $1.05 million for projects outside of Targeted Employment Areas.\nEB-5 financing typically accounts for between 20 and 30 percent of a project\u2019s capital stack, replacing preferred equity. The funds are a loan, so if it all goes according to plan and the project is completed, it\u2019s a win-win for investors and developers.\n\u201cWhen we look at the people from Latin America coming in [to the U.S.], most of them are coming to get an education for their children, and sometimes the parents don\u2019t even come over,\u201d attorney Jill Jones, who has been involved in more than 600 EB-5 projects, said. \u201cThe parents will apply for the green card for the family. They\u2019ll send over their college-age children and purchase a condo for them to live in.\u201d\nThe program has been around since 1990 \u2014 yet experts predict a last-minute scramble driven by the demand for legal immigration. It\u2019s unknown if it will be renewed, especially as the Trump administration pushes its\ngolden visa program\nthrough. The golden visa, with a starting price tag of $1 million, is more expensive and the visa-seeker does not get any of that money back.\n\u201cA lot of foreigners want to get in before it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s a premium on legal immigration.\u201d\nAttorney Ronnie Fieldstone\nDevelopers and investors are keeping a close eye on two deadlines: grandfathered provisions expiring at the end of September 2026 and the expiration of the regional center program a year later in 2027.\nDespite the Trump administration\u2019s\ncrackdown\non immigration through mass deportations and aggressive ICE raids, the U.S. is \u201cstill the country of choice\u201d for immigrants, said attorney Ronnie Fieldstone, a partner at Saul Ewing.\nFieldstone, who has represented developers and regional centers involved in more than 450 EB-5 projects that have raised more than $8 billion, said that after September 30, 2027, the investment amount will increase based on cost of living.\n\u201cA lot of foreigners want to get in before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Fieldstone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a premium on legal immigration.\u201d\nT\nhe payoff\nDevelopers like EB-5 because it\u2019s a cheaper-alternative financing, Fieldstone said. And many have been tapping into the program for years without disclosing it to the public, including the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club, a\nFort Partners\ndevelopment in Surfside that was completed in 2017.\n\u201cThe fact is most [developers] keep it under the radar,\u201d Fieldstone said.\nOther projects that recently raised funds or are currently doing so via EB-5 include Fortune International Group\u2019s Ora by Casa Tua condo-hotel tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell, Fortune and Blue Road\u2019s Nexo Residences in North Miami Beach, SB Development Group and Hazelton Capital Group\u2019s Edgewater condo tower called Cove Miami and Okan Group\u2019s Okan Tower in downtown Miami. In Broward, the Related Group and Dezer Development\u2019s Armani/Casa Residences Pompano Beach, and Related, Tate Capital and Rok Enterprises\u2019s Bahia Mar are also tapping the EB-5 spigot.\nMost, if not all, of these developments have hospitality components, which makes it easier to fulfill EB-5\u2019s job-creation requirements.\n\u201cEventually [the program] will go away. There seems to be this urgency, especially with what\u2019s happening in the world with immigration.\u201d\nMichael Sadov\nMichael Sadov, sales director at the 70-story Okan Tower condo and hotel project under construction, agreed, calling it \u201cfree money for the developers.\u201d Okan\nannounced in August\nthat it was eligible to receive EB-5 funds and plans to release 30 investor slots at a time.\n\u201cEventually [the program] will go away,\u201d Sadov said. \u201cThere seems to be this urgency, especially with what\u2019s happening in the world with immigration.\u201d\nSadov said the developer, who is Turkish, is working with a dozen potential investors from Colombia, Mexico and Turkey. (The developer is Turkish.) Colombians have been the biggest buyer pool among\nforeign buyers\nin South Florida in recent years, but it\u2019s become harder for them to come. Trump, who has been feuding with Colombian president Gustavo Petro, recently threatened to raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the country.\nCompass agent Mike Martirena expects to see more foreign buyers from countries like Colombia invest in EB-5 projects. His team has brokered deals to Colombian and Brazilian investors at Alta Development\u2019s River District 14, a condo development in the Miami River neighborhood.\n\u201cThis is a smart way to get money out of the country,\u201d Martirena said.\nF\nlip side\nEB-5 isn\u2019t for everyone.\nOnly 10,000 visas are available per year. The upfront cost of becoming an EB-5 designated project can deter investors, according to Fieldstone.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll raise the money,\u201d he said.\nJones also explained that it\u2019s more complicated than traditional bank lending.\n\u201cWith that comes a lot of reporting and assurances that a developer not using EB-5 wouldn\u2019t have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would need to have someone on their team that could track how many investors came in, how many jobs were created that can be allocated to each investor and making sure that the EB-5 money is never commingled with other operating funds. These are things that they wouldn\u2019t face in other types of finance. They have to be very patient.\u201d\nWhether a developer raises EB-5 funds directly or uses a regional center will affect the timeline.\nInvestors are also vulnerable to their own set of issues. How long it takes investors to receive their green cards depends on where they hail from. Mainland China and India have waiting lists that are years long, but the processing time for investors from other countries can be as quick as a few months to secure conditional residency, and two years before it becomes permanent, Jones said.\nInvestors have also fallen victim to fraud and stalled projects.\nDeveloper Dan Kodsi\u2019s Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter has been on hold for well over a year. Kodsi raised money via EB-5 for the planned 50-story condo-hotel tower, just as he did with Paramount Miami Worldcenter. But Legacy is tied up in a messy foreclosure lawsuit, and construction stalled last year \u2014 exactly when the project was supposed to be completed.\nUp and down South Florida\u2019s coastline, investors have also sued the developers of a handful of projects over alleged mismanagement or misappropriation of funds. In 2023, Chinese nationals sued the ex-developer of the former U.S. immigration building site in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside, alleging the misappropriation of more than $50 million in investor funds.\nMuch of the opportunity for fraud was eliminated with the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, experts say.\n\u201cThe worst thing [that can happen],\u201d Fieldstone said, \u201cis they lose their money and don\u2019t get a green card.\u201d",

        "content": "The week restaurateur Tyler Wells reopened his Altadena restaurant after the Eaton fire, Compass agent Teresa Fuller snapped up a reservation.\nThe scene was both joyous and painful. The restaurant, formerly Bernee and now called Betsy, had great food \u2014 a farm-to-table concept whose white anchovy-topped Caesar salad and wood-oven cheesecake were renowned within weeks. But steps away, diners could see the hollowed-out Woodbury Building, a reminder of the destruction caused by January\u2019s fire.\n\u201cI knew every single person\nin the restaurant\n,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cI got emotional. It was overwhelming.\u201d She lives and works in nearby Pasadena, while her home gets remediated. She lost her storage space for staging supplies and business records while her office got tested for heavy metals.\nOn Saturday nights since, it\u2019s become normal again to see Betsy patrons sitting outside on Altadena\u2019s Mariposa Street, an ordinariness many have craved since Jan. 7 when the Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through, destroying more than 18,000 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Fuller also frequents the Good Neighbor Bar and West Altadena Wine and Spirits, all in a bid to bring life back.\nThe fires were devastating, but it was\nafter the flames were tamed\nthat all hell broke loose. Government leaders scrambled for a game plan, inflamed residents pointed fingers, onlookers added their two cents, insurance was a terror, tariffs took on a new toll and opportunists entered the picture.\nBetween the recovery, the outrage and the concern, the real estate industry in the region has settled into a new role. They\u2019re not just brokers or builders behind the rush to rebuild; they\u2019re also sounding boards, community leaders, experts in how to price homes when there are no comps and even economic development players who now understand the importance of normal routines \u2014 like Saturday nights out at an up-and-coming spot \u2014 returning in Altadena and the Palisades.\n\u201cWe need to eliminate this fear of being a dead town,\u201d Carolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld said.\nI\nt\u2019s all personal\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s JJ Meyers was grabbing coffee and walking his dog when the Palisades Fire broke out.\nHe watched in real time as local news filmed the burning home of a friend\u2019s parents, their family clock being carried out.\nWhen the fires were controlled and the city began its recovery, the real estate industry picked up early on residents\u2019 concerns and misgivings.\n\u201cImmediately, the [client] inquiries were, \u2018What do you know that I don\u2019t know?\u2019 There was such a general distrust immediately,\u201d Meyers recalled. \u201cIt was like they were coming to us because they didn\u2019t believe the information they were getting. It was helping give people a general level of respect they didn\u2019t feel they were getting.\u201d\nThe bottom line: Brokers were living the disaster along with their clients.\n\u201cOn a personal level, I love Kagawa. Every year, there were Halloween parties, Super Bowl parties, USC events, BBQs, you name it.\u201d\nJeffrey Sandorf, vice president of Southern California division sales at Thomas James Homes on the mostly destroyed street where his firm will soon finish the area\u2019s first rebuilt house\nJacqueline Chernov, who joined the Beverly Hills Estates earlier this year from Compass, had her Palisades homes \u2014 a Spanish-style residence in the Huntington and the family property of 22 years in the Alphabet Streets \u2014 destroyed by the fire.\nThe number of temporary homes she\u2019s lived in has now crept into the double digits; Chernov\u2019s currently in a Malibu rental and hopes it can be home until her actual home is rebuilt. She does have a permit pulled for the Huntington home. At the Alphabet Streets property, she\u2019s changed the plans and is not in a rush to rebuild.\nChernov was underinsured on both properties and is still awaiting money from State Farm. She described the insurance company \u2014 the largest home and auto insurer in the state \u2014 as difficult and chalks that up to a business model that holds the purse strings closed long enough for some people to give up on their claims. Hiring an adjuster to see the claims through to resolution and giving up 25 percent wasn\u2019t an option.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this as another full-time job,\u201d Chernov said of the insurance.\nHer only break was a trip this summer to Amsterdam, for her daughter\u2019s wedding. It was good to be out of town for a while, she said.\nT\nhis is client service\nOn Jan. 22, a group of agents sat huddled in the living room of a Hollywood Hills home unsure of what was next and what they could do.\nThey discussed navigating new price-gouging rules, insurance, what the burned communities would be rebuilt into and, of course, Measure ULA.\nThe city of Los Angeles\u2019 two-tier tax, also referred to as the mansion tax, has been a thorn in real estate\u2019s side since it went into effect in April 2023. Charging a blanket 4 percent tax on properties starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more is absurd, the industry has repeatedly cried.\nIn the Palisades, which is within the city of Los Angeles, paying a tax on a sale that\u2019s resulted from a natural disaster makes even less sense, some argue.\nIn early October, Mayor Karen Bass asked the city council to pass a temporary pause on the measure, offering a glimmer of hope.\n\u201cIt should 100 percent be passed. It should have been passed at the beginning of any sales,\u201d Shanfeld said. \u201cIn the Palisades, these poor people having to pay the city on land that they lost, nothing infuriates me more.\u201d\nFor a while, in January and February, the workload was all fire-impacted clients, all the time. That included advocacy work, like the ULA fight.\nThe workload has shifted since then.\nSome, like Chernov, split time between fire clients and regular listings in other parts of L.A. County. Others, like Shanfeld, focus on clients who sought whatever temporary housing they could get immediately after the fires now looking for better digs elsewhere. Still others have clients who are simply holding their lots and staying put completely outside of the burned areas in places such as Brentwood, Ojai, Santa Barbara or even as far as Tennessee.\nBrokers who are still working with the fire-affected often hold their hands through challenges like dealing with insurance, which they are gaining first-hand experience in themselves.\nLike Chernov, many clients have chosen to handle insurance on their own, rather than tap an adjuster for an additional fee, according to architecture firm Archicraft.\n\u201cFrom an insurance perspective, they want to pay as little as possible and, as a homeowner, you want to get as much as possible,\u201d Archicraft U.S. Partner Tyler Vaughn said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a game of chess, and they don\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\nThe firm has one client in Altadena and six in the Palisades \u2014 five homeowners and a recreation center project in the Highlands under the Palisades Hills HOA. The firm and others like it have been the first line of assistance for some clients navigating insurance on top of the actual design process.\nRising construction costs of anywhere from $650 to $1,100 per square foot have exacerbated challenges. Meanwhile, insurance companies are coming back with quotes of $350 a foot.\n\u201cThe insurance has been the most frustrating,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cI just got off the phone with one of the builders and they were saying clients needed to pick all their finishes, plumbing and appliances because they got notice everyone was raising prices by 9 percent.\u201d\nP\nolitical games\nIt was July 7, when a group of five protestors stood outside Pasadena City College\u2019s Westerbeck Recital Hall holding up posters declaring \u201cHome Sweet Hazmat\u201d and \u201cStep Up! Clean It Up!\u201d\n\u201cThere is no recovery without remediation,\u201d shouted Grace Regullano, whose Pasadena home sits about 400 yards from the Eaton Fire\u2019s southern edge. \u201cWe have been left alone. We are breathing the toxins in our walls. There is asbestos in my office. There is lead in my soil. My children cannot go home. All we are asking for is for Newsom to speak with us and explain why we are not getting support to clean up the toxins.\u201d\nThere was no better way to grab the attention of problems fire survivors didn\u2019t feel were being addressed than to gather where news outlets would be, waiting bored in the hot sun for security clearance to enter the auditorium and hear local and state officials discuss the state of rebuilding at the fires\u2019 six-month mark.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was among the speakers to tout what has now been repeatedly cast across press conferences and press releases as the \u201cfastest recovery in modern history\u201d when it comes to debris removal.\nChest pumping\u2019s left a bad taste for some, especially with Newsom sitting for a cover story in October\u2019s Bloomberg Businessweek, a splashy headline casting him as the leader of the Trump resistance. The article\u2019s opening scene setter suggested January\u2019s wildfires could have been the collapse of his political career.\nInstead, he\u2019s rebuilt his profile with vehicles such as Prop 50 \u2014 the ballot measure that would redraw Congressional district maps as pushback to Texas\u2019 redistricting \u2014 and made housing advocates happy by aggressively going after non-compliant cities when it comes to residential development. Most recently, he signed off on Senate Bill 79 aimed at adding density close to transit stops.\nThat the National Guard and federal officers were deployed to MacArthur Park in Los Angeles\u2019 Westlake neighborhood the same day as the six-month anniversary briefing in Pasadena may have helped further swing the trajectory for Newsom. The governor seized on the timing in a briefing with the media immediately following the presentations.\n\u201cWhat a disgrace that\u2019s happening at MacArthur Park. What theater on the six-month anniversary of these fires,\u201d Newsom spit out as the cameras rolled and pens flew across paper.\nThe politically charged atmosphere tied to the fires hasn\u2019t been limited to Sacramento.\nSome homes in the Palisades have signs calling for Bass\u2019 resignation. In Altadena, it\u2019s become an urban planning fight against gentrification and speculative development that\u2019s led to the Altadena Not for Sale movement\u2019s rise. Signs for the group stick out from the dirt or remaining lawns outside many homes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation,\u201d Anthony Marguleas, a longtime Palisades broker and owner of Amalfi Estates,\nsaid\nin September, sitting in the kitchen of his Corsica Drive listing, in the Riviera neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple people online that are so politically charged, who are so anti-Mayor Bass and so anti-Newsom and so conspiracy theorist. I\u2019m not going to talk about the whole political conversation. All I care about is our town being rebuilt.\u201d\nMany agents have taken the same route: heads down, focused on their jobs.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t paid attention to the [media] coverage,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cMy main focus has been the people that I can help.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t listen to that noise,\u201d Chernov said.\nThe only political gambit they\u2019re happy to broach: ULA. \u201cI mean, the only noise that could be positive is if the mayor really does take away ULA for fire victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a gamechanger.\u201d\nV\nillains and bad guys\nIt was early August when news came out that Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California agents Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe represented an overseas buyer on\nthe purchase of nine burned lots\nin Malibu totaling more than $65 million. That number\u2019s since climbed to 15 lots.\nSome on social media went berserk.\nThere were calls for Malibu City Council intervention. Others blasted the idea of \u201cforeigners\u201d buying U.S. land and shook their fists at the agents facilitating the deals.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a general misconception sometimes when a foreign investor quote-unquote makes a large investment into a city,\u201d Howe said in August, at the time the deals were uncovered. \u201cIt can be perceived the wrong way.\u201d\nThe buyer is a company called Zuru Tech US, an El Segundo-based subsidiary of Zuru Group in Hong Kong. The business was started by New Zealand toymaker brothers Nick and Mat Mowbray. Zuru Tech US is the company\u2019s prefab housing arm.\nZuru Tech US Director of Operations Marcel Fontijn was shocked by the reactions to the lot purchases.\n\u201cThey made us look like a villain, but we did not end up with 15 lots by putting guns to people\u2019s heads,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll of these people were ready or desperate to sell. It\u2019s just like the guy that won the lottery [who\u2019s] buying in the Altadena area. He\u2019s not taking advantage of people. He\u2019s not abusing people. People want to sell.\u201d\n\u201cThe only noise that could be positive is if the mayor really does take away ULA for fire victims.\u201d\nJacqueline Chernov, broker at Beverly Hills Estates\nThe Powerball winner is Edwin Castro, who is using the prize money to fund a real estate investment vehicle called Black Lion Properties. The company had acquired 13 lots as of Sept. 28, according to the Altadena Not for Sale group, with the total investment over $8 million.\nZuru Tech contemplated purchases in the Palisades but decided working with one municipality would be easiest. So far, there have been initial conversations with the city of Malibu; Fontijn estimated the first of the houses using the company\u2019s factory-built homes could be installed starting in late 2026 in a process that takes roughly two to three months.\nFontijn said he still fields inquiries from sellers, although the company\u2019s running close to the end of its spending spree. Still, the executive can\u2019t shake how some spun the purchases into a narrative of another kind.\n\u201cI really felt we were doing something good and then some of the comments, they were nasty,\u201d Fontijn said. \u201cSome said that we were using Chinese money to kick people out of Malibu. Nobody kicked anybody out of Malibu, and it\u2019s not Chinese money either. It\u2019s U.S. money that we\u2019re investing back into the U.S. economy. Yes, obviously, at the end of the day, we\u2019re a business. We\u2019ve all got to make some money, but it\u2019s not about taking advantage of people that lost their homes, not at all.\u201d\nFor agents, the nasty comments aren\u2019t new, especially for communities that see themselves as unique and want to protect that from change.\n\u201cI understand the mindset of wanting to guard that character,\u201d Fuller in Altadena said. \u201cI also think that we have to trust our neighbors. They need to do what they need to do, and we can\u2019t understand everyone\u2019s circumstances. There has been a fear that developers would come in from the outside and build homes that might change the character of what was.\u201d But, she added, many of the developer-built homes \u201care quite thoughtful.\u201d\nSomehow, the good guys are getting mixed in with the bad guys who have lowballed offers or are mounting what some would say are cheap-looking spec homes. Agents say inquiries from vulture investors have subsided since the fire\u2019s early days. Many of the out-of-town buyers are not factoring in a parcel\u2019s lineage or an entire community when running the numbers. A family or another buyer who does will beat the misinformed offers on any day, agents said.\n\u201cI understand this is a business, but we need to respect the process,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the receiving end of disrespectful offers from people out of town: here\u2019s an offer at one-tenth of your asking price with a very generic letter, not taking into account the pain these people might be going through, pouring salt in the wound.\u201d\nH\nome sweet home\nCommercial tenants have generally come back first. The Palisades is expected to see the reopening of Rick Caruso\u2019s upscale retail center Palisades Village next year, and a plan to redevelop the Gladstones site on Will Rogers State Beach into a Frank Gehry-designed two-story restaurant operated by Wolfgang Puck received a California Coastal Commission development permit last month.\nResidential neighborhoods, by contrast, are in the very early stages of construction or environmental remediation.\nAsilomar Boulevard, in the Palisades\u2019 El Medio Bluffs neighborhood, counted 16 residences with views of the Pacific Ocean. Since January, it also overlooks the ruins of the community\u2019s burned beachfront homes. It\u2019s a sobering reminder of just how much more work is ahead of communities and the industry.\nBut slowly, frames of new homes have begun to go up.\nThomas James Homes will complete its roughly 6,500-square-foot lot in the Alphabet Streets later this month. It will be the first home rebuilt in the neighborhood.\nJeffrey Sandorf, vice president of Southern California division sales at Thomas James Homes, is a fourth-generation Palisadian, with kids who are the fifth. His family goes back 70 years, so rebuilding hits close to home for the Sandorfs.\nPre-fire Thomas James Homes completed more than 60 projects in the community and is now working with more than 30 families on their rebuilds. So far, the company has pulled seven permits and has 10 in plan check with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety.\nThe home, at 915 Kagawa Street, is meant to be a showcase for the community, an example of what the next phase here will look like, as well as a venue for workshops and education.\nRight now, the company is guaranteeing a starting price of $650 per square foot and completion in one year or less. Services are in house, and Thomas James has a pre-curated set of plans for homeowners to choose from, which can shave weeks or even months off the design phase.\nSandorf was so busy with the workload he couldn\u2019t take a call from Amalfi Estates\u2019 Marguleas back in September when the broker phoned to say he was on his way to the Kagawa Street property to walk a reporter through the construction site.\n\u201cThis is such a passion for me personally and I\u2019m so proud that Thomas James Homes is going to be able to complete a house, furnish it and open it up to the public to give a sense of hope of what\u2019s to come and give some tangibility to the rebuild,\u201d Sandorf said.\nIt gives him chills to think about that milestone.\n\u201cOn a personal level, I love Kagawa,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of my friends lived on Kagawa; they still own their properties. Every year, there were Halloween parties, Super Bowl parties, USC events, BBQs, you name it. I was on Kagawa a lot. When I drive up and down, it\u2019s a much different landscape.\u201d\nThat\u2019s slowly changing. The agents, brokers, developers, architects and construction crews on the ground will tell you they\u2019ve already turned the page on the jarring images of burned lots piled with debris that caught the nation\u2019s attention and are living the next chapter.\n\u201cThat was the story before,\u201d Carolwood\u2019s Shanfeld said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re in a different part of the story and it\u2019s important that it be reflected because that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d",

        "content": "At the age of 13, an awkward time to change schools, Corinne Verdery moved from Oahu, Hawaii, to Mission Viejo in Orange County with her parents and younger sister.\nIt was a different world.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a classroom and everybody\u2019s got blonde hair,\u201d Verdery, now CEO of Caruso, said. \u201cI think it shaped me back then to know how to pivot and adapt and embrace the uncomfortable.\u201d As a result, she added, \u201cI love to work on anything new and different that I\u2019ve never done before.\u201d\nVerdery\u2019s\ncareer\nhas been eclectic. She worked in the theme park division of NBC Universal and at Alagem Capital Group, where she was instrumental in bringing the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills to life, steering the project through 19 public hearings and a citywide ballot measure.\nShe started at billionaire\nRick Caruso\n\u2019s real estate development and management firm as executive vice president of development in September 2016, then shifted to chief development officer before being tapped as CEO in September 2022. She has overseen the development of the Rosewood Miramar Beach resort and Palisades Village for Caruso, who ran for mayor in 2022 and may mount another bid or aim for governor. The developer has also been front and center in the wildfire recovery, starting the nonprofit Steadfast LA in February to speed rebuilding.\nCaruso founded his Los Angeles-based firm in 1987. Its portfolio is predominantly\nretail\nand restaurants and includes The Grove in Fairfax (where the firm is based), Palisades Village in the Pacific Palisades (slated to reopen in August), The Americana at Brand in Glendale, Village at Moorpark and The Lakes at Thousand Oaks. More residences are on the way and the firm is also eyeing assets beyond California.\nWith Verdery at the helm of the 130-employee company, Caruso recorded its best financial results in 2024, with about 7 percent net operating income growth year over year across all asset classes, with the number on pace to tick up this year.\nOn an overcast day in Los Angeles,\nThe Real Deal\nchatted with Verdery over tea on the second floor of La Piazza restaurant at The Grove.\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: February 23, 1970\nHometown\n: Oahu, Hawaii\nLives\n: Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles\nFamily\n: Husband Tyler and twin 20-year-old daughters\nIn February 2022, Rick Caruso announced a succession plan with you elevated to CEO should he be elected as mayor of Los Angeles. But he wasn\u2019t, and you were still appointed CEO that September. What led to you actually being brought on as CEO?\nWe have basically organized into two businesses: development, which buys the properties, entitles and builds; and operations. I came on as the head of development. I think a year before he announced he was running, we started talking about me stepping into the CEO role. I really love development and growing the business, but he needed me and I wanted him to become our\nmayor\n, both as a resident and as an employee of the company. We were coming out of Covid, we were coming out of riots and a lot of disruption in the city, and I really felt like, as an employee, we needed that kind of leadership to protect our investment and our business in Los Angeles. We agreed that I would step into the CEO role if he became mayor. But during the primary, it was clear that the company needed my leadership on a daily basis, because he was spending so much time on the campaign. I had already started doing the job once he announced, to be honest.\nDid you think that role would continue after he lost?\nHe really wanted me to be in the CEO role. I had already promoted someone to succeed me, and he was doing great.\nWhat\u2019s the greatest challenge in replacing a \u201cpersonality-driven\u201d founder?\nI respect and admire his ability to trust me in my day-to-day decision making. That has to be hard. But we are good partners. I know what he\u2019s brilliant at. He knows where my strengths are. And so three years later, I think we have a great rhythm. It\u2019s been bumpy at times, but overall I think we\u2019ve landed in a great place.\nWhat\u2019s an example of a bumpy time?\nWe had talked about me being the CEO and what my job was going to be, but we didn\u2019t talk about what it was going to be like with him still in the company. And so we had situations in meetings where the teams would present to us, and they would be looking at both of us, like, who\u2019s going to make this decision?\n\u201c[In 2017,] we figured out there are these private firefighting companies that most companies that own real estate have. We\u2019ve had to call upon them almost every year. That day of the Palisades fire, the teams were in place.\u201d\nWhen I interview a woman or someone of color for The Closing, I like to ask what it\u2019s like working in a field dominated by white men. Do you encounter discrimination in the boardroom?\nI\u2019ve always been in a male-dominated industry. I guess I\u2019ve never tried to change it. I\u2019ve always just embraced it as \u201cthis is what it is. I\u2019m going to focus on my strengths and my contributions, and focus on the work.\u201d I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve been in situations and places where there\u2019s discrimination going on in the boardroom or in the company. It\u2019s like, \u201cIf you guys are going to go golfing and smoke cigars, just call me when you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll be here doing my work.\u201d I\u2019ve never tried to be part of that boys\u2019 club.\nHow about a girls\u2019 club?\nI realized when I became CEO there were a lot of expectations about how I was going to lead. I didn\u2019t focus on changing the company, but I did recognize that there was this need to figure out within this company and within this industry, how do women rise to the top? So I formed a women\u2019s resource group within Caruso. We have outside speakers and programs to give this group of women in the company the support and the encouragement and the coaching that they need. This wasn\u2019t intentional, but since I\u2019ve been CEO, the mix of the company now is 50-50 men and women, from 60-40 before. Women in leadership roles is now over 50 percent.\nYou\u2019re from Hawaii, right?\nI\u2019m from the North Shore of Oahu, born and raised.\nHow\u2019d you get here?\nMy parents were high school sweethearts. They got married and had me when they were 18, and I was born and raised on the North Shore, fourth generation on both sides, born on the islands, and they just wanted our lives to be more. They didn\u2019t go to college. My dad went to two-year business school and then took a job in California to get us off the island and hopefully give us a different and brighter future. When we left the North Shore, our names were in the paper.\nWhy the paper?\nPeople didn\u2019t get up and move to the mainland.\nLet\u2019s shift gears to the Palisades. What was the experience like having your complex survive when everything around it was decimated?\nIt was a devastating time. I still get choked up about it. In our company, we build these centers of town, and in order to get that right, you spend a lot of time, many years and months developing relationships with community members. By the time you open and are operating, you know people by name that come and visit your property and frequent the restaurants and the shops and it was hard to see their homes devastated. I feel like we\u2019re turning a corner now, and everyone is focused on, let\u2019s get Palisades Village reopened. There will be new elements of the design and the property and some new tenants, so that when we reopen in August, it\u2019s fresh.\nWhat work are you doing at Palisades Village?\nThere was smoke damage and water damage. So we\u2019re gutting a lot of the spaces and the apartments down to the studs because the smoke is in the studs and installation. The park in the center of the property sits on the parking structure. We removed all the dirt and we\u2019re going to put all new grass and landscaping in.\nHow much will that project cost?\nI don\u2019t have a recent estimate, but it\u2019s at least $50 million.\nCaruso got criticized for employing private firefighters to save the shopping center while most of the community burned to the ground. How did you deal with that criticism?\nWe learned about fires in 2017 when there were deadly fires and floods in Montecito. We were under construction in both the Palisades Village and the Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Montecito. The Montecito Fire Department said if the fire jumps the freeway, we\u2019re not going to be able to help you. That\u2019s when we figured out there are these private firefighting companies that most companies that own real estate have. Since that Montecito fire, we\u2019ve had to call upon them almost every year. And so that day of the Palisades fire, the teams were in place. They come with their own crew and water trucks filled with water. We fought shoulder to shoulder with the fire department and we saved several of the buildings around Palisades Village that weren\u2019t our buildings. That doesn\u2019t get reported on. The fire department hooked up to our water trucks when they needed water.\nDid any employees lose their home in the fires?\nRick\u2019s children lost their homes in the Palisades. I think some employees received smoke damage, but nobody [else] lost their homes.\nThe kids aren\u2019t employees, though, right?\nOne of them is. Justin Caruso works for the company. He is in our real estate development group. And the children are board members. We formed the board during Rick\u2019s mayoral campaign. We were getting ready if he was to be mayor, we wanted a board in place. It\u2019s myself and two other executives, as well as his four kids, that sit on the board. Rick\u2019s on it now because he didn\u2019t win. He\u2019s our board chair.\nWhat is your career \u201cSliding Doors\u201d moment?\nOnce I knew I was going to start a family, and I was pregnant with my twin girls, I knew that I had to change my career trajectory because if I wanted to be happy in my marriage and be a good mom, then I couldn\u2019t get on a plane anymore. I was doing global real estate around the world for Universal. I was gone two weeks out of every month. I decided that I was going to quit Universal and take a more local job. That\u2019s when I went to work for Alagem Capital and did the Waldorf Astoria. And so as I look back on my career, it bums me out sometimes that I turned down a lot of global work. But it\u2019s not a regret. I\u2019m happily married. My girls are awesome. I got to spend so much time with them. I never missed anything that they did, and I volunteered just like the other moms that don\u2019t work.\nWhat was your last vacation destination?\nJapan in early June. This was the first time in a year that we had been on vacation together because the two girls have different schedules.\nLet\u2019s do an Oahu, Hawaii, versus California lightning round. Poke bowl or fish taco?\nFish taco.\nFor breakfast, Spam or avocado toast?\nAvocado toast. [Later, Verdery admitted that her answer is really Spam but she was embarrassed to admit it!]\nShave ice or frozen lemonade?\nShaved ice.\nThey have it in California.\nIt\u2019s not the same here. There the syrups I feel like are different. In Hawaii they have more tropical flavors, and they put different things in the shaved ice. So you can have adzuki beans, you can have ice cream, you can have condensed milk on the top. Also they perfected the machine that shaves the ice; it\u2019s much more fine. Here it\u2019s like chunks of ice. There, it\u2019s like powder.\nAnd you said \u201cshaved,\u201d but isn\u2019t it actually \u201cshave ice\u201d?\nI call it shaved ice.\nWaikiki Beach or Malibu Surfrider Beach?\nI don\u2019t like Waikiki Beach because there are a lot of tourists, so can I say North Shore beaches?\nHiking Diamond Head or Runyon Canyon?\nDiamond Head.\nHot, humid Oahu summer or dry, sunny SoCal summer?\nOahu summer.\nLush rainforest trails or desert hikes in Joshua Tree?\nRainforest trails.\nA luau or a beach bonfire?\nLuau.\nUkulele jams or guitar sessions?\nUkulele jams. I just like the sound of the ukulele better.\nWeekend trip to the North Shore or Big Sur road trip?\nNorth Shore weekend.\nHawaii sunset or California sunset?\nHawaii sunset.",

        "content": "On a Monday afternoon in February 2019, Chicago developer James Letchinger was staring expressionless at his wall, trying to process the most crucial moment of his career.\nLetchinger, whose JDL Development is arguably the biggest developer in the city, had just gotten word from his investment partner, prolific real estate fundraiser Larry Krueger, about the land in River North they were trying to buy from the Catholic church.\nThey had just closed on a deal to fund its massive development. The title company called to confirm.\n\u201cI was literally in shock,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cI was desperate. I had a lot of money at risk.\u201d\nHe\u2019d learned from Krueger that they were set to buy the property for upwards of $100 million. From his desk at the office, then in Goose Island, he could see their plans for the property at 14 West Superior Street: a two-tower, mixed-use building, 77 floors at the tallest point. It would be called One Chicago.\nSix years later, on the last day of September 2025, Letchinger was staring at a wall in his new office in that very building, now the eighth-tallest skyscraper in the city. He was having another solitary, somewhat stoic celebration. Within his sightline this time were the plans for\nFoundry Park\n, a $1 billion-plus development on 28 acres of the former Lincoln Yards site, which he had just closed on with Los Angeles-based Kayne Anderson\nfor $84 million\n.\nThe project, as famous for being huge as for being stalled, has been a political and financial disaster. Previous developer Sterling Bay was going to turn it into a $6 billion behemoth spanning the Chicago River along 53 acres of waterfront land beside wealthy\nLincoln Park\nand gentrified Bucktown.\nBut its lender, Bank OZK, ran out of patience with delinquent debt owed by\nSterling\nand its previous investment partner Lone Star Funds, and seized the property. Letchinger\nbought his parcel\non the north side of the river from Bank OZK in a deal that took a lot of energy, knowledge and relationships, but getting the project done won\u2019t be just another feather in his cap.\nFoundry Park\u2019s momentum also underscores the revival of Chicago\u2019s megadevelopment market on several sprawling sites that have sat fallow for years. In September, The 78 \u2014 an $8 billion development \u2014 got an important approval, and a separate South Side project secured land for its multibillion-dollar quantum computing facility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy when you have the money. Things can go fast.\u201d\njames Letchinger\nCorporate commitments to Chicago had become harder to land after former mayor Rahm Emannuel, perceived as business friendly, was replaced by a reformist candidate in Lori Lightfoot. The city\u2019s reputation suffered under barrages of attacks from the first Trump administration and amid viral images of destructive racial justice protests in 2020, when Lightfoot ordered river bridges raised to keep disorder out of the Loop. Lightfoot\u2019s succession by an even more unabashedly progressive mayor, Brandon Johnson, exacerbated concerns of investors.\nAdd in the national drop in commercial property values, and the overriding force for development in the city was inertia. Sure, Letchinger and Krueger got One Chicago done, but it wasn\u2019t a magic button for the even bigger swings.\nNow, with a few megaprojects set to move forward, every Chicago real estate owner has a stake in the outcome. Shepherding them to completion isn\u2019t just good for morale, it\u2019s crucial for the city to dodge more dreaded property tax hikes \u2014 Johnson is already wrestling with how to plug a $1.2 billion budget hole for 2026. And officials throughout all reaches of government \u2014 the statehouse, Cook County offices and ward and precinct-level leaders \u2014 are scrambling for legislative solutions that could spare homeowners from facing foreclosures over unpaid bills as their property taxes skyrocket.\nBut maybe all they needed was Letchinger and Foundry Park.\n\u201cJim is a problem solver. He takes projects others find difficult or uneconomic and he finds a way to make them work,\u201d said Krueger, who runs the commercial property investment firm\nWanxiang America Real Estate Group\non behalf of a Chinese family with an auto parts fortune.\nS\nmall firm, big backers\nWhen it kicked off in 2016, Lincoln Yards was supposed to be Chicago\u2019s biggest project in decades. Proposals started grand, with soccer stadiums and skyscrapers, but ultimately shrunk for zoning approval.\nThe Foundry Park Letchinger\u2019s building could create nearly 3,300 homes, mostly rentals with some for-sale options, as well as 350,000 square feet of office space, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hospitality and 12 acres of open space, according to city records. It\u2019s far less commercial workspace than Sterling Bay had planned, but it will be the biggest project of Letchinger\u2019s career.\nLetchinger, son of a salesman, was born and raised in Chicago. He went to the Latin School of Chicago and graduated from the University of Michigan. He learned \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d in college, he said.\nHe got into business, with a lighting showroom in River North that targeted architects and designers as clientele, which served as his introduction to real estate. Development fit his maverick nature. His first project, in 1993, was a building on Walton Street that he purchased from the co-op of an adjacent luxury building whose residents included Chicago business heavyweights, including the late Jay Pritzker. The co-op board insisted he had to buy without a financing contingency.\n\u201cI knew nothing. I walked out of the meeting and called my banker and asked, \u2018What\u2019s a financing contingency?\u2019\u201d Letchinger said.\nHe did the deal and converted the property into condos.\nFor the next decade, he worked on midscale, for-sale residential properties. The Great Financial Crisis almost ruined him, but he got through and became a big-time rental and condo highrise developer backed by institutional capital. His firm consists of just a handful of people, including his son, Joey, who skipped college (with dad\u2019s blessing) to become a sommelier and wine broker in New York before returning to Chicago and JDL.\n\u201cGrowing up, it wasn\u2019t like he went to work, he came home and there was separation,\u201d Joey said. \u201cHis work has always been a very important part of our family. Every single night of the week, having dinner and talking, it was mostly about what JDL is doing.\u201d\nThough Letchinger happily remains the face of his projects, he has partnered with a Who\u2019s Who of high finance and CRE titans to raise money when he needs it. That list includes Square Mile Capital, now Affinius, Prudential and Wanxiang.\nIn 2011, he teamed with Hines to break ground in Old Town on Chicago\u2019s first major multifamily project post-2008 recession. They sold the resulting property for $163 million, a record price per unit at the time.\nFrom there, Letchinger took on several large projects, ranging from the South Loop to Wrigleyville. He has a role in the office development underway at 919 West Fulton Street, as well as a slice of The Parker Fulton Market apartment building. He built the luxury condos No. 9 Walton at 9 West Walton Street, where Governor J.B. Pritzker just bought a multi-floor spread from fellow billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\u201cIt almost killed me,\u201d Letchinger said. JDL had been involved in building out each fully customized unit for a discerning crowd.\nWith the deal for The Parker earlier this year, Letchinger became a buyer rather than builder. JDL partnered with the family office of John Schreiber, the Lake Forest resident who co-founded Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, to purchase that property for $93 million. They teamed up again when Schreiber bought the Cobbler Square Lofts in Old Town for about $90 million.\nJDL is also making progress on the $1.3 billion North Union, its transformation of the former Moody Bible Institute into more than 2,600 dwellings.\n\u201cWhen I closed on Foundry, my wife looked at me and said, \u2018So you\u2019re not retiring?\u2019 No. I\u2019ve got a good 20 years left,\u201d Letchinger, 62, said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never retire.\u201d\nR\nelationship business\nDuring his 15-year building spree, Letchinger didn\u2019t just mind his own projects. In 2019, about the time Letchinger was closing on the property that would become One Chicago, he hosted a meeting about Lincoln Yards at his old office.\nHe sat at the table with a group that included Chicago Alderman Brian Hopkins and Sterling Bay\u2019s CEO Andy Gloor.\nLetchinger was there to boost the $6 billion Lincoln Yards campus \u2014 his competitor\u2019s project.\n\u201cIt was compelling, exciting. As a developer you\u2019re envious of someone who can do something so massive in my city,\u201d Letchinger said.\nLetchinger is the kind of businessperson who says yes when he means yes and no when he means no. If he doesn\u2019t want to get drinks with you, he won\u2019t. He golfs with friends, not to network. Though Letchinger can be a lone wolf, he knows the pack \u2014 the institutional players he needs to partner with to get his projects built.\nThis straightforward attitude helps explain the unusual 2019 meeting. At that time, Letchinger was still working to line up the $100 million land purchase for what would become One Chicago. Sterling Bay was going to be a primary fundraiser.\nBoth One Chicago and Lincoln Yards were under the governance of Hopkins, the alderman, and Letchinger thought he could help move along Sterling Bay\u2019s vision for its riverfront land as he pushed forward on One Chicago.\nAdvice often goes ignored, and Letchinger claims he told Sterling Bay to not get into expensive infrastructure commitments that would nail down city subsidies for Lincoln Yards. Sterling did anyway, and the deals proved fatal for its plans.\nIn the process of going to bat for Lincoln Yards, Letchinger also solidified his relationship with Krueger, who had been working extensively with Sterling Bay on successful Chicago developments, notably Google\u2019s Fulton Market headquarters, in the previous few years.\nWanxiang America is an auto parts manufacturer that has brought hundreds of millions in capital to high-profile Chicago real estate projects over the last decade and a half.\nWhen Gloor decided to focus on Lincoln Yards instead of investing in One Chicago, Krueger stepped up for Letchinger. Wanxiang itself would fund JDL\u2019s land purchase, Krueger said, in the call that left Letchinger staring stunned at his wall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate partner,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cLarry Krueger has a special place in my business life.\u201d\nLetchinger paid dearly to maintain the relationship.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got other partners that are not as willing as Jim has been to really kind of do whatever it takes to help his partner get through a difficult time,\u201d Krueger said.\nOne Chicago ended up being completed at the worst possible time for a developer needing to refinance a massive construction loan. The commercial property market had nosedived, and Letchinger had to subordinate his interest in more than $260 million of developer equity to Wanxiang in order to pull off a $415 million refinancing last year. He did so with little hesitation. The refinancing took construction lenders, including Affinius, out of the building\u2019s financial stack.\n\u201cIt was a lot of money, and it was a big bet, but it was a leap of faith,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cThis was a risky construction project.\u201d\nPerhaps as a result, Wanxiang is still taking swings with JDL. Last year they scored a $160 million construction loan for a 95-unit condo project in Juno Beach, Florida, which is close to wrapping up.\nLetchinger\u2019s relationships aren\u2019t just with the industry. In March, he donated $1,000 to a political organization for Alderman Scott Waguespack, whose district now includes the Foundry Park site.\nOf his political donations, Letchinger said, \u201cI am an equal opportunity check writer, give to everybody,\u201d while noting he had supported Waguespack with another $1,000 back in 2022, \u201clong before I moved on Lincoln Yards.\u201d Illinois records show he has personally contributed over $90,000 to political candidates since 2005, with the biggest amounts going to Hopkins and fellow North Side Alderman Brendan Reilly. Reilly\u2019s campaigns recently collected over $12,000 from Letchinger and another $25,000 from a One Chicago ownership entity while gearing up for a run at longtime Cook County board president incumbent Toni Preckwinkle.\nP\nressing go\nChicago\u2019s megadevelopments don\u2019t have to be stuck in the mud. What rebirthed Lincoln Yards as Foundry Park was a simple decision by Lone Star to move on from Sterling Bay\u2019s vision, and find an exit, even at a painful loss. When there\u2019s a drought of development capital, a moment of repricing can bring opportunity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy when you have the money,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cThings can go fast.\u201d\nOn Oct. 24, he purchased an additional 2 acres of vacant land next to Foundry Park from General Iron, which is still looking for a buyer for another 18 adjacent acres \u2014 as it has been since 2022.\nAfter so many years of Sterling Bay planning and negotiating Lincoln Yards, the larger change of ownership happened swiftly \u2014 Letchinger first met with Kayne Anderson in South Florida to propose partnering on the purchase in May of 2025.\nAs summer 2025 gave way to fall, Letchinger found he wasn\u2019t alone. Chicago\u2019s megaproject engine really started revving again.\nWith publicly traded lending partner Blue Owl, developers Related Midwest and CRG\nclosed\non a $75 million land purchase from U.S. Steel for a former South Side metal mill now set to be turned into the multibillion-dollar computing facility. Related, in tandem with a controversial Iraqi-British billionaire and local billionaire Joe Mansueto, also scored a key approval, which will let them build a $650 million soccer stadium for Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC team at The 78, another long-anticipated site. The 78 is located between the South Loop and Chinatown.\nThe megaprojects could literally reinvent the old Chicago.\nLike the quantum computing site, Letchinger\u2019s Foundry Park is built on a defunct past. Its land once housed the city\u2019s oldest steel factory, which was demolished in 2012. The 78\u2019s development canvas is, similarly, an old railyard property.\nTheir development would chart the next phase of Chicago\u2019s evolution from industrial powerhouse into technological hub, but they\u2019ll have to build quickly for the city to maintain its status as one of the world\u2019s great financial centers.\nP\nicking teams\nAt first, Letchinger\u2019s Foundry Park looked like it would be closer in scale to the planned Lincoln Yards; Letchinger and Kayne made a $60 million offer to buy the southern parcel of the megadevelopment, which Sterling Bay has hung onto with its partner JP Morgan Investment Management.\nBut Sterling Bay wouldn\u2019t budge, even raising the prospect of litigation during JDL\u2019s negotiations for the rest of the site.\n\u201cI told Kayne, \u2018We\u2019re done, let it go,\u2019\u201d Letchinger said. \u201c\u2018I can promise you that the city is going to do what we need to do if we just have the north side. We do not need the south side.\u2019\u201d\nBut Letchinger isn\u2019t afraid of a fight or of being the small guy in a lopsided contest. He played rec basketball well into adulthood, despite a frame safely below six feet \u2014 he says it\u2019s the one thing he misses from being younger.\n\u201cEspecially at my size, it takes a toll on your body. Because I had to play hard. But I loved playing down low,\u201d he said.\nHe still loves the game. But even as a spectator, he can spot an all-star.\nIn April, he was courtside at the United Center for a Bulls post-season game. JDL was already gearing up to make a run at Lincoln Yards; the next month, Letchinger would meet with Kayne to hash out the financing.\nBut that day, just a few seats away, he spotted Keating Crown, Sterling Bay\u2019s managing principal and main financial backer, and great-grandson of one of the city\u2019s core industrialists, Henry Crown.\nThe Bulls lost the play-in that day, and Letchinger didn\u2019t approach Crown; although they\u2019ve had a congratulatory phone call since JDL and Kayne took over the north side of Lincoln Yards. Letchinger said Gloor has been less friendly.\nBut victory isn\u2019t unimaginable.\nWhile Letchinger isn\u2019t set on acquiring the southern side of the project anymore, he\u2019s open to considering another offer if it comes back to the market.\nHe envisions building a school on part of that land as an enhancement for Foundry Park. Perhaps he\u2019d develop some more housing, he thinks, though less dense than the plans for across the river.\nFor now, Sterling Bay is the southern parcel\u2019s steward.\n\u201cIf we do something on the south side, at this point it\u2019s going to be, candidly, with their blessing and knowledge,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cNot because I\u2019m worried about litigation. There is none. It\u2019s just not necessary. I never intended to have an issue with them.\u201d",

        "content": "By September, it seemed like things couldn\u2019t possibly get worse at 7500 South South Drive.\nA little-known real estate investor from Wisconsin named\nTrinity Flood\nbought the Chicago apartment building in 2020. As an out-of-state-investor, it\u2019s not clear how much she knew about South Shore, the building\u2019s neighborhood, which skirts Lake Michigan and extends west to I-90. Transportation access, unique 1920s apartment buildings, side streets lined with single-family homes and the forthcoming Obama Presidential Library all\nlend\nto South Shore\u2019s\nappeal\n.\nBut it\u2019s farther south than buzzier South Side neighborhoods like Bronzeville and Hyde Park and the neighborhood still struggles with the remnants of decades of redlining and disinvestment. As of October, South Shore had the highest number of homicides in the city over the past 12 months, according to neighborhood-level data compiled by a local ABC affiliate. Both Hyde Park and Kenwood, immediately north of the neighborhood, have had zero homicides in the past year. To successfully invest in Chicago, in other words,\nlandlords\nneed to know neighborhood and even block-level nuances.\nAt 7500 South Shore, it soon became apparent that Flood was not prepared.\nSince 2020, the property\u2019s conditions have deteriorated significantly. Elevators are broken, sewage gases are leaking through the building and the city\u2019s legal department recently documented \u201carmed occupants along with alleged criminal activity and shootings at the property.\u201d\nWells Fargo, on behalf of CMBS bond holders, filed a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit in April for delinquent payments on a loan backed by the South Side property as well as several others in Chicago, Georgia and Arizona.\nRather than quietly admitting defeat and handing her keys back to the lender, Flood responded by clinging to the properties via extensive litigation. Recent filings hone in on Flood\u2019s inability to find an insurer for the building and struggling with the costs of a lender-placed policy.\nNow, her attempts to hang onto control of the apartments as long as possible have snowballed into a worst-case scenario few could have imagined five years ago.\nOn the night of Sept. 30, hundreds of federal agents raided Flood\u2019s South Shore Drive building in an event that yielded national attention.\nVideos taken by neighbors show agents descending on the five-story brick building in helicopters, while trucks and the inconspicuous vehicles favored by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ferry in hundreds of others. ICE Chief Gregory Bovino charged in, tailed by a News Nation camera crew invited to follow the operation. Many tenants were reportedly detained outside for hours, before being released back into the building.\nThe operation, a combined undertaking of the FBI, ATF and Customs and Border Protection, yielded 37 arrests. Some arrested were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators,\u201d according to The Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cThis raid was really unlike anything that I have witnessed, either as a lawyer or as a law professor,\u201d Hugh Mundy, a law professor at The University of Illinois Chicago who specializes in criminal procedure, said.\nMaking the building\u2019s downfall even more stunning, 7500 South Shore had undergone a multimillion-dollar renovation shortly before Flood purchased it and was, according to brokers, nearly 100 percent occupied at the time.\nThough most multifamily purchases won\u2019t end up this poorly maintained or the\ntarget of a federal raid\n, 7500 South Shore\u2019s undoing still serves as a cautionary tale of how neglect can lead to financial distress, especially when a property ends up in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s ramp-up of federal policing powers.\nIn that sense, Flood\u2019s property is far from the only one facing precarious circumstances. As of October, lenders in the U.S. have already 50 percent more multifamily foreclosures than they did in all of 2020, according to data from ATTOM Real Estate Solutions.\nB\nuyer beware\nIn January 2018, New York-based Dax Real estate paid just under $11.5 million for three complexes with 208 combined units at 7500 South South Shore Drive, 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, according to Cook County property records.\nThe South Shore Drive property was \u201cvery rundown and substantially vacant,\u201d managing partner Daniel Hedaya told The Real Deal in 2019. DAX spent several million dollars on renovations to the building, he said.\nIn the spring of 2019, DAX went to sell the properties for $20 million, marketing the area as \u201cone of the most appreciating pockets of the South Side,\u201d according to Aaron Sklar, one of the Kiser Group brokers who had the listing. Flood closed in early 2020, paying 60 percent more than DAX had spent two years earlier.\nBut she was unsatisfied with her purchase.\nShortly after buying the apartments, Flood filed a lawsuit alleging Hedaya and his brokers, Sklar and Noah Birk of Kiser, had improperly inflated the properties\u2019 values.\nSquatters began to take up residence in the building, and city inspectors reported that the property manager was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nThe building needed around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly, she said. The seller had not made her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nBut in a legal response, Hedaya\u2019s attorney noted that Flood had assigned an intermediary to review details of the purchase and wanted to close quickly because she was trying to execute a 1031 exchange.\n\u201c[Flood] seek[s] only to complain about the outcome of [her] own actions \u2014 committing to a deal before undertaking the expansive due diligence to which they were entitled,\u201d the response reads.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023, but by then Flood was racking up significant city code violations on at least two of her three Chicago buildings. Sklar and Birk declined to comment.\nIn August 2021, about a year and a half after Flood purchased the portfolio, a fire broke out at her Clyde Avenue property, one of the other South Side buildings in her portfolio. The blaze injured four tenants and a firefighter. The city began monitoring it for code violations, and inspectors also tracked similar problems at 7500 South Shore.\nSince then, the buildings racked up dozens of code violations, most associated with the South Shore Drive building.\nThe slow deterioration soon accelerated.\nIn 2022, under a rental assistance program established by the state of Illinois, some migrants moved into the property, though it\u2019s unclear how many. Tenants generally didn\u2019t report concerns with them besides an increase in trash in the hallways, according to Jordan Karsh, an organizer with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization who had helped form a tenants union at the building in 2024.\nThe turning point, Karsh said, was when a new property manager, Strength in Management, took over in early 2024. Soon after, Flood stopped providing security services, and maintenance issues went unaddressed.\nFlood and Strength in Management did not respond to requests for comment.\nSquatters began to take up residence in the building, and city inspectors reported that the property manager was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nFlood attempted to sell the portfolio around the same time but never closed a deal.\nIn a code violation case still pending in court, city officials this summer requested that a judge appoint a limited receiver to the property. Wells Fargo also requested that a judge issue a receiver to the property as part of its foreclosure proceedings which kicked off in April.\nOn Sept. 30, just one day before a judge was scheduled to hear Wells Fargo\u2019s argument for receivership, federal agents swarmed in for the raid.\nThere is some speculation that Flood or Corey Oliver, who owns Strength in Management, tipped off federal agents about the presence of migrants and illegal activity in the building. Agents carried out the raid with the consent of the owner, according to the New York Times.\nA map found at the property shortly after the raid and photographed by a Chicago Sun Times reporter included labels for units with migrants and squatters.\n\u201cWhoever tipped off ICE about that level of detail about who\u2019s in what unit in the building has to have had knowledge of that,\u201d Karsh said. \u201cThe most obvious answer to that would be Strength in Management or Trinity Flood.\u201d\nCity officials, who were also familiar with conditions at the property, denied any collaboration with federal authorities ahead of the raid.\nFor Flood, the aftermath of the raid plunged the reputation of her South Shore Drive property to a new low \u2014 but it also meant she had evaded receivership for just a bit longer.\nE\nxpect the unexpected\nNot long after Flood bought the South Shore Drive building in early 2020, interest rates took a historic plunge, spurring a boom of investment and new development in many U.S. cities.\nBut when rates rose again soon after, buyers who made risky purchases in 2020 and 2022 found themselves in a losing battle. Inexperienced investors and syndicators have gotten hit with foreclosure filings, and mortgage fraud that took place during the frothy period has begun to threaten the stability of some regional banks.\nSince the beginning of the year, lenders have filed 11,300 multifamily foreclosure complaints, compared to 7,500 in all of 2020, ATTOM found.\nWhether problems at other struggling properties across the U.S. would make federal raids a serious risk is unclear, especially since the massive operation on South Shore Drive defied long-established norms of search and seizure, legal experts said.\nLenders in the U.S. had 50 percent more multifamily foreclosures in the first nine months of 2025 as they did in all of 2020.\nSource: ATTOM Real Estate Solutions\n\u201cYou would normally expect that kind of force to result in more arrests for more serious crimes,\u201d Mundy, the law professor, said, calling the scale of the raid more fitting for a racketeering investigation.\nHe added that a warrant typically targets specific units rather than an entire building. TRD requested copies of warrants and arrest records from the federal agencies involved in the raid but has not gotten a response.\nEven before the raid, federal agents were challenging conventions of immigration enforcement across the city.\nA U.S. district judge in Chicago recently ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people in Chicago without warrants in January, violating a consent decree that dictates how such arrests can be carried out.\nLandlord groups like the National Apartment Association have put together guidance on how to respond to subpoenas and raids. Property managers are not required to allow ICE agents to enter a building, they advise, unless they have a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Owners can consult with attorneys before responding to a subpoena for information about tenants.\nOnce law enforcement agencies enter a property, however, landlords have little influence over how a raid is conducted.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, there is not much a landlord can do as it relates to police conduct within their building, whether in a common area or a tenant\u2019s apartment,\u201d Monu Bedi, a DePaul University College of Law Professor who specializes in criminal procedure and military law, said. \u201cIf there is damage to the building, landlords are able to recover money for the property but that is different than their rights to prevent officers from entering.\u201d\nT\nhe fallout\nWhen the dust settled in the weeks after the raid, just 35 paying tenants were left living in the 130-unit building, along with about 10 squatters, Oliver, the property manager, told Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton Oct. 17.\nKarsh estimates that a majority would like to move out if given financial assistance.\nThe building remains on insecure footing, both in terms of safety and finances.\nInspectors tasked with evaluating electrical systems at the building were alarmed by faulty wiring leading out to the city\u2019s utility poles, noting that lines hang low enough for a live wire to hit the top of a garbage truck, they said at a recent hearing.\nThey also pointed to fire hazards caused by extension cords and hijacked meters in the building, likely used to provide power to squatters\u2019 units. Only one of the building\u2019s elevators is operating \u2014 still. A plumbing inspector noted that the boiler room had a strong odor that could be attributed to a gas leak and stated that raw sewage and sewer gases were leaking into the building.\nBut Oliver said that since the raid, Flood had invested $100,000 into repairs to the building, including plumbing and electrical repairs. He also said he was told he needed to re-submit a permit for some of the electrical work that needed to be done at the property.\nThree armed security guards are another new addition. They now patrol the building from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night.\nOliver asked Judge Debra Seaton what he should tell Flood if the recommended repairs are more costly than she expects. Flood never appeared at the hearing, her attorney attending on her behalf.\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be an issue if she wants to keep this out of a receivership,\u201d Seaton said. \u201cYour owner could have been present for his hearing today and she is represented by legal counsel.\u201d\nSeaton said she will not appoint a receiver until she can evaluate the progress of the work at the property. If the immediate dangers are not resolved quickly, she said she will not only consider appointing a receiver but will also weigh issuing a court order for all the remaining tenants to relocate, likely with relocation assistance.\nThings might not turn around so easily, Alderman Greg Mitchell, who represents the area, believes. That worries him.\n\u201cMy current concern is that I still don\u2019t feel the building is safe,\u201d he said.",

July Residential bought the properties in 2021.\nThis month will bring $590 million in loans to the auction block across the Texas Triangle, up from\n$575 million in October\n, but down from\n$710 million in September\nand\n$670 million in August\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with five loans topping $200 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nJuly Residential allegedly defaulted on an $81.5 million mortgage from Voya backed by five properties:\nCasa Grande Apartments, a 268-unit complex at 9445 Concourse Drive;\nShadowtree Apartments, a 428-unit complex at 9475 West Sam Houston Parkway;\nAirport Crossing Apartments, a 178-unit complex at 8300 West Airport Boulevard;\nTownhome Apartments, a 73-unit complex at 8030 West Airport Boulevard; and\nPlaza at Hobby Airport Apartments, a 328-unit complex at 8501 Broadway Street.\nThe properties were constructed between 1976 and 1983. The loan works out to $63,921 per unit.\nAustin\nLangdon Street Capital is facing foreclosure on Langdon at Walnut Park after the loan tied to the property\nheaded to special servicing in September\n. The foreclosure appears to be fallout from the recent passage of House Bill 21, which requires operators that used a property tax credit loophole to come into compliance with new requirements in order to maintain their exemptions. Langdon Street Capital borrowed $60 million from Argentic for the property at 12101 North Lamar last year. Debt on the 277-unit property, built in 2018, works out to $216,606 per unit.\nSan Antonio\nLakewood, New Jersey-based Raven Capital Group could lose Vive Apartments in San Antonio. The owner took out a $23.8 million mortgage on the 280-unit apartment complex at 9400 Fredericksburg Road in 2021.

Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm took out a $37.4 million mortgage from First United to refinance the 105,550-square-foot property at 2651 North Harwood Street in 2020. It works out to $354 per square foot for the office building built in 1984.\nFort Worth\nThe biggest new loan headed to auction in Tarrant County this month is a $6.8 million mortgage tied to Regency Apartments. Utah-based Harris Investment Group took out the loan in 2022. The 72-unit property at 2507 Airport Circle was built in 1967. The debt works out to $93,750 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the nine properties facing foreclosure in Houston\u2019s Harris County, two are regulars. Both properties owned by Rao Polavarapu\u2019s Falls Apartment, which had a loan head to special servicing in August, received multiple foreclosure notices but haven\u2019t been sold yet.\nFalls of Braeburn, a 191-unit complex at 9707 Braeburn Glen ($64.5 million); and\nFalls of Westpark, a 356-unit complex at 6130 Southwest ($29 million).\nTwo properties in Bexar County are headed to the block again:\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central ($10.5 million); and\nA retail building at 22615 North U.S. Highway 281 home to Dutch Bros.

        "content": "How else could these three characters have ended up in one room except as part of a social media stunt to sell a hacienda in the Texas Hill Country? There was Kai Cenat, the most popular entertainer on streaming platform Twitch; Tony Parker, French-American MVP of the legendary 2000s-era\nSan Antonio Spurs\nlineup; and Erwin Nicholas II, better known as Mr. Real Estate.\nParker owned the location, an estate at\n9 Rue Parker in Boerne\nwhich he wanted to offload. A Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent tried unsuccessfully to move the home the traditional way, but Parker took it off the market after failing to get a $19.5 million ask. Parker then hired Nicholas, a Houston real estate player who works with sports stars and celebrities, to market the 53-acre property, set amid Boerne\u2019s coveted scenery and access to dark skies, wineries and biergartens, German architecture and exotic hunting ranches. Nicholas heard that Cenat, who\u2019s in a collective of streamers and influencers called AMP Squad, was looking for a place to host a \u201csubathon\u201d \u2014 a livestream that would go 12 hours a day, 30 days in a row. Feeling that Parker had exhausted his options on the local Multiple Listing Service, Nicholas thought Cenat could market the home and its amenities to AMP Squad\u2019s 19 million followers.\n\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a really big open house,\u201d Nicholas said.\nHeralded by a teaser video featuring T-Pain, Cenat and his gang moved in. The performers racked up tens of millions of views. On a July day near the end of the subathon, they held a pool party. Hip-hop throbbed from the subwoofers as Cenat strode out of the mansion, weaving through hundreds of friends, fellow internet celebrities, fans on pilgrimage and locals who mobbed the Romanesque courtyard, their liquor bottles scattered on benches, plinths and flowerbeds.\nThe camera caught aspects of the property consistent with the \u201cunparalleled privacy, uncompromising security and refined luxury\u201d in the listing, like the lagoon, the waterpark (the largest residential one in the U.S.) and the Spanish architecture. It captured others that probably wouldn\u2019t have been publicized: the livestreamers\u2019 portable toilets, food trucks, dunking booth, buffet line, impromptu boxing ring and chatter.\n\u201cThis is hot and boring. This is the boonies. You gotta come to the city,\u201d a woman in a bikini yelled. Kai nodded, and the woman\u2019s friend tried to pull her away: \u201cYou heard of the Alamo and shit like that?\u201d\nNicholas was an unlikely producer for this scene. Unlike Cenat, Mr. Real Estate is \u2014 was \u2014 largely unknown. As a Houston investor and broker specializing in working with athletes and entertainers on their real estate purchases, he\u2019s operated until now with no advertising, no team and often no MLS, focusing mostly on off-market trades.\n\u201cMost athletes have an assistant, obviously an agent, or a financial adviser. These are the people that actually make the decisions.\u201d\nErwin Nicholas II\nHis lone-wolf approach cost him access to the broader market, but he says it\u2019s gained him entry into the opaque world of selling homes for the suddenly super-rich, often in private. It\u2019s not clear how many luxury homes are sold off-market, but non-disclosure laws and high property taxes make Central Texas a national\nhotspot\nfor such trades, according to local agents. The story of Nicholas\u2019 rise sheds light on this world, especially the ultra-private transactions of celebrity athletes, where real-life connections to the \u00e9minences grises behind them are the highest form of currency.\nWhile some agents make a business out of Instagram, Nicholas has publicized almost none of his deals. It\u2019s not that secrecy is key, in his opinion; it\u2019s that publicity isn\u2019t profitable. Clicks and SEO are only currency to agents who find clients online.\nBut it\u2019s hard to avoid the public square. As the Sun Belt residential market flags, even at the luxury end, Mr. Real Estate is making use of his clients\u2019 fame for the first time to source and close deals. Still, Twitch streaming could be a long shot as a strategy for selling a mansion in Boerne, and he\u2019s still waiting to see if he\u2019ll sink it. If he can sell Parker\u2019s home after Cenat\u2019s residency, that could settle the score \u2014 and maybe help the chances of one of America\u2019s most expensive listings,\na $195 million Beverly Hills\nestate that he recently signed on to sell.\nT\nhe draft\nAs a college student studying biology on a merit scholarship in the 2000s, Nicholas nursed an entrepreneurial ambition. Nicholas was drawn to star athletes and celebrities from the start; he recognized a gap in the market in Houston for agents that served celebrities, as compared to glamour-saturated California and New York. He trawled nightclubs after class as a junior, hoping to gin up real estate business and get mentioned in the society blogs to build some name recognition. This didn\u2019t work out exactly how he had hoped: An NBA player he\u2019d been scouting forgot his name and addressed him as Mr. Real Estate. The name stuck.\nHe mapped out players\u2019 favorite haunts. Over cocktails and under strobe lights, Nicholas slipped his business card to Astros, Rockets and Texans.\nHis connections eventually brought him his first marquee deal: a leasing gig for Adrian Peterson, the East Texas native and record-setting NFL running back. As fate, or style, would have it, Nicholas called around and found Peterson a house that once belonged to fellow Houston football legend Warren Moon.\n\u201cI was able to secure his house, and that established my credibility in the athlete world,\u201d Nicholas said.\nMultiple high-profile Houston athletes followed: NFL cornerback Xavien Howard, Astros fielder Michael Bourn, NBA star DeAndre Jordan and No. 1 shooting guard Jalen Green among them. He took Drake around town and showed homes to comedian Gary Owens.\nThe initiation was twofold. As Houston\u2019s glitterati recognized Nicholas as a member of the court, their managers, agents and advisers recognized the young entrepreneur offered more than just flash.\nT\nhe drive\nIn the high-touch Texas luxury sphere, it\u2019s almost more important to connect with the entourage than with potential clients themselves. Millionaires in their twenties tend to delegate real estate decisions to risk-averse gatekeepers who prefer to work with people they already trust.\n\u201cMost athletes have an assistant, obviously an agent, or a financial adviser. These are the people that actually make the decisions,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI ended up just networking with advisers, seeing who\u2019s working with who.\u201d\nNicholas shares a client with Jacob Wilson, a former Wells Fargo executive who\u2019s now a financial adviser to some members of the Dallas Cowboys and a few entertainment celebrities. The two are cut from similar cloth. Wilson\u2019s firm, Riley, Darby and Wilson Private Wealth Management, doesn\u2019t even have a website. Like Nicholas, Wilson gets clients almost solely through referrals. He won\u2019t say which of them works with Nicholas, nor does he elaborate much on how they got to know each other, except to cite \u201ca mutual friend.\u201d\nWilson does say he vetted Nicholas thoroughly before he referred him.\nThe peculiar challenge of representing athletes, Wilson notes, is that they frequently move. Additionally, they can\u2019t be sure of how long they\u2019ll stay in the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find a professional athlete that\u2019s, for example, like Dak [Prescott], that\u2019s stayed here for, what, 10 years? Awesome for him, that\u2019s fantastic. But that\u2019s not all athletes,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHow much home can they afford? They see all this new money; is the money going to be there forever? What\u2019s prudent?\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to find examples of carelessness: Vin Baker, the former NBA All-Star who ended up managing a Starbucks, or Randy Brown, who had to auction off the championship rings he earned alongside Michael Jordan after declaring bankruptcy.\n\u201cWith the athletes and entertainers, specifically athletes, a lot of their money is made on the front end,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe first thing that you have to think through with somebody that suddenly comes into money is, you just want to protect it, because it may not happen again. This could be a one-time thing.\u201d\nBy 2010, one of Nicholas\u2019 networking leads brought him to a bowling alley where Texans tackle Frank Okam liked to play on Wednesdays. Team members and other athletes often joined him, including an NBA rookie named Patrick Patterson, freshly drafted by the Rockets. Up to that point in his life, the young Patterson had relied on a savvy school friend to essentially serve as his manager, handling some fiscal decisions and helping Patterson stay organized. After the friend moved back home to pursue a career as a wealth adviser, Nicholas filled in.\n\u201c[Patterson] basically asked me to be a part of his team. He kept calling me \u2014 \u2018What is this?\u2019 \u2018Where is that?\u2019 I was like, \u2018You need help?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI was damn near his roommate.\u201d\nHe managed Patterson\u2019s affairs for several years while also networking with other gatekeepers and learning concretely what athletes and their advisers need. Once Patterson moved on to a new team, Nicholas was ready to pivot to real estate full time.\nT\nhe deep three\nTo hear Nicholas describe it, joining a brokerage or team is a sort of Faustian bargain, a trade of long-term freedom for immediate gain. He\u2019s never split a commission.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no clients there,\u201d he says simply. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not productive for me if I\u2019m out here really networking and building relationships. \u2026 I\u2019m not trying to be the president of nobody.\u201d\nHolding things close to one\u2019s chest has its benefits. To clients like Will and LeBrina Jackson \u2014 a retired NFL cornerback and reality television star, respectively \u2014 Nicholas\u2019 straightforwardness, privacy and hyper-local experience made him the best choice. Will\u2019s agent referred the couple to Nicholas, and he sold them their current home, an equestrian estate just west of Houston.\n\u201cHonesty and the ability to educate a client without all the fluff, without all the BS\u201d \u2014 those were Nicholas\u2019 winning traits, LeBrina said.\nA sports agent\u2019s trust is hard-won, and it lasts, according to Wilson. The task of guarding a twenty-something athlete\u2019s volatile wealth requires gatekeepers to consider a lifetime of home purchases, not just the next one.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good real estate professional, you\u2019re talking to this person all the time. They shouldn\u2019t be just advising on this specific transaction. They should be a consultant to your real estate portfolio or needs for many, many years,\u201d Wilson said.\nBut while Nicholas has found a deeply loyal clientele in a wealthy niche, he\u2019s also forsworn the resources and branding of firms like Compass and Sotheby\u2019s, not to mention the exposure of the internet. Over his 20-year career, Nicholas has completed $375 million in sales volume. The top luxury agent in Houston, Compass\u2019 Laura Sweeney \u2014 who, it should be noted, has had a longer career \u2014 completes about $150 million each year.\nThen again, Wilson says, if you\u2019re not one of the few real estate agents a financial adviser has learned to personally trust, you\u2019re not going to get his client\u2019s listing \u2014 no matter what logo might be on your business card.\nStill, Nicholas is continuing his adventure in publicity. When the Jacksons listed the farm at 20431 Old Windmill Trail in August, hoping to move to a farm with more space for their horses, it became Nicholas\u2019 second publicized listing, appearing in Jennifer Gould\u2019s Gimme Shelter column at the New York Post.\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the modern online leads will move the homes. Whatever a broker\u2019s strategy, homes are selling more slowly, and the general market has flipped to buyers in many metros, including Austin, once the trendiest city in the Lone Star State, and Houston, one of the top five biggest metros in America to see annual price depreciation.\nAt the moment, Parker\u2019s hacienda in Boerne is still on the market, though some buyers have expressed interest.\nCenat, meanwhile, has been hard at work in Beverly Hills. AMP Squad just finished another subathon at the Palazzo di Amore, the Beverly Hills compound owned by tycoon Jeff Greene, another seller dissatisfied with the uncreative efforts of previous agents, who enlisted Nicholas to sell his $195 million property. At one time, it was the most expensive public listing in the country.\nAttention isn\u2019t the only new thing for Nicholas, who plans to keep the same asking price when it hits the market. He is also co-listing with another agent, Patrick Michael of LA Estate Brokerage. During the subathon, Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus swung by. LeBron James gave Cenat a haircut on camera. And Nicholas\u2019 long shot is hanging in midair.\n\u201cIf you have the best house that offers something that you want the world to see, why not?\u201d Nicholas said.",

        "content": "If reality is usually worse than the fantasy, in downtown Dallas, the real thing is actually better. Up in the suburbs, they are sure downtown\u2019s streets are dangerous and dirty, yet when developer Tanya Ragan tours out-of-state investors around, they sing a different song: it\u2019s much cleaner than their central business districts back home, they tell her.\n\u201cI live in two worlds,\u201d said Ragan, one of downtown\u2019s loudest cheerleaders.\nBut as\ntenants like AT&amp;T\nlook to relocate to the white-hot DFW suburbs, the potential of downtown\u2019s downfall stands to block a revival \u2014 whatever the truth.\nThe telecoms giant has been scouting a new office in Plano or Richardson since the summer, threatening to vacate its 1 million-square-foot downtown footprint, which represents 4 percent of all office space in the submarket.\nOf course, AT&amp;T isn\u2019t the first to eye a switch. Tenants have been leaving for\nUptown and the suburbs\nfor the better part of two decades. AT&amp;T\u2019s potential departure comes as Dallas\u2019 NBA and NHL teams run up against their leases at American Airlines Center. (The arena isn\u2019t technically downtown; it\u2019s across Woodall Rodgers Freeway in Victory Park, but it\u2019s a lot closer than rumored new destinations like Plano, Irving and Arlington.)\nDowntown has plenty of local boosters pushing to renovate office buildings or convert them to residential, and the revamped convention center set to debut in 2029 is already booked. There\u2019s funding. Still, momentum is lacking. In the story of flight-to-quality in the office market, downtown Dallas is the origin city, not the destination.\nTo be sure, maintaining the perception that downtown is undesirable may benefit suburban office owners and tenant rep brokers, who stand to gain when downtown tenants head elsewhere, according to Pacific Elm Properties\u2019 Jonas Woods and Billy Prewitt.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious financial incentive to push tenants to more expensive buildings,\u201d Woods said.\nSomewhere between the vocal critics and cheerleaders lies the real story of the urban core, where political leadership tends to get in its own way and investors waiver on the material odds for a comeback built from the rubble of its office market collapse.\n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n  \n\n  \nLeaflet map created by Adam Farence\n\nD\nowntown\u2019s problem\nEveryone\u2019s in at least one Facebook group that traffics in nostalgia with grainy, washed-out photos of a city\u2019s downtown in a heyday that didn\u2019t last that long.\nOld photos of Dallas show a town on the come-up in the mid-1970s: busy downtown streets, now-vintage neon lights advertising iconic spots like The Adolphus Hotel. Reunion Tower \u2014 the landmark topped with a three-story observation ball \u2014 was completed in 1978, the same year the I. M. Pei-designed City Hall would open. The skyscrapers that define the city\u2019s skyline went up to house the burgeoning financial services industry.\nThe savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s hit the rising financial center hard. By the late \u201990s, downtown Dallas was famously home to fewer than 500 people. The pandemic also ravaged the city center, emptying office buildings and driving up violent crime.\nThe perception of downtown as unsafe belies the fact that violent crime is on a downward swing; it dropped nearly 20 percent between 2024 and 2025. Violations related to homelessness, like sleeping in public and solicitation have decreased almost 35 percent in the same time frame, data from the Dallas Police Department shows.\nStill, there has been violence. Two shooting deaths on Dallas Area Rapid Transit trains within six days of each other this fall renewed pressure for public safety measures. Longtime downtown tenants cite security as the primary reason to relocate.\nT\nhe relocation game\nIn 2012, Klyde Warren Park paved the way for an office exodus. The 5-acre deck park covers Woodall Rogers Freeway, connecting downtown to Uptown.\nKelcy Warren, the son of the park\u2019s billionaire namesake, donated $10 million to the development project. In addition to private donations, the project was funded with $20 million in bond proceeds, $20 million from the federal government through TxDOT and $16.7 million in federal stimulus funds.\nIn a city short on natural resources, the park is an active outdoor space with community events almost daily. At lunchtime on weekdays, suits pour out of office buildings on Woodall Rodgers Freeway to grab lunch at the food trucks lining the edges of the park.\nAccounting firm Pricewaterhouse-Coopers ditched its 144,000-square-foot downtown footprint at Trammell Crow Center in 2017 for Park District. Invesco and a brigade of law firms followed suit, landing in flashy trophy office buildings on Field Street and McKinney Avenue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018revitalization\u2019 because I feel like we\u2019re past that.\u201d\nTanya Ragan\nThe exodus to Uptown will reach a fever pitch when Goldman Sachs and Bank of America depart for their built-to-suit trophy towers on\nY\u2019all Street\n.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 move to the 800,000-square-foot campus at Hunt Realty\u2019s upcoming development NorthEnd will leave a 175,000-square-foot swath of empty office space at Trammell Crow Center. The 1.2 million-square-foot skyscraper at 2001 Ross Avenue will be half-empty before 2030.\nBank of America is ditching its namesake downtown tower for Parkside Uptown, the 500,000-square-foot project being developed by Pacific Elm and KDC.\nThat\u2019s without adding in the firms heading to a different municipality, like Plano, Frisco or Richardson. It can be lucrative to play the corporate relocation game outside the city, Partners Real Estate\u2019s Steve Triolet said, as the popular northern suburbs are known to lavish incentives on companies that sign leases in their domains.\nThe trend has saddled downtown with a mountain of empty office space. Of Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s approximate 172 million square feet of office space, downtown Dallas accounts for almost 7 percent, according to data from Partners. The overall market has a vacancy rate of 25 percent; in the central business district, it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\u201cThose downtown buildings are kind of Swiss cheese,\u201d Triolet said, rattling off a list of the imperiled properties: Harwood Center, Bank of America Plaza, Fountain Place, Trammell Crow Center, Chase Tower, Ross Tower and St. Paul Place.\nT\nhe conversion conversation\nWhat to do with downtown\u2019s core glut of outdated office space? Downtown\u2019s most ardent champions swear by adaptive reuse.\nShawn Todd\u2019s Todd Interests turned the 50-story First National Bank Tower built in 1965 at 1401 Elm Street into The National, a mixed-use tower with a luxury hotel, 324 multifamily units, 37,000 square feet of office space and 43,000 square feet of retail. The firm also revamped Energy Plaza, at 405 North Ervay Street, into The Sinclair.\nPacific Elm\u2019s Woods and Prewitt bought Thanksgiving Tower in 2013 and have been fixing it up ever since. Now known as Santander Tower, the 50-story former office building at 1601 Elm Street is home to a hotel, 228 multifamily units and 756,000 square feet of office space. The office space is currently 85 percent leased, Woods said. Pacific Elm is about to start construction on the conversion of Bryan Tower.\nThe redevelopment of The National and Santander Tower, which are about a block from each other, has activated a stretch of Elm Street with ground-floor food and beverage concepts.\nWoods believes adaptive reuse is the key, \u201cthe most productive thing we could do to dramatically change the existing dynamics\u201d of downtown Dallas, he said.\nDevelopers have been revamping office buildings in the urban core for decades, Prewitt said. But the current stock \u2014 albatrosses constructed in the \u201980s \u2014 makes this cycle particularly challenging.\nThe government could help ease the process, Triolet said. The Texas Legislature, in its most recent session, passed Senate Bills 2477 and 840; both aim to streamline the conversion process.\nStill, the cost-intensive nature of a residential conversion makes these deals hard to pencil, even with incentives from the city.\nAt the moment, all eyes are on Mike Hoque and Mike Ablon. The heads of Hoque Global and Pegasus Ablon have teamed up to take a $409 million swing at rehabbing Dallas\u2019 tallest building, Bank of America Tower. The pair secured a $103 million incentives package to convert part of the 72-story skyscraper at 901 Main Street into a hotel.\nDowntown stakeholders are eager to see the project succeed, but Hoque\u2019s redevelopment dreams are still mostly unproven. Project delays have led to skirmishes between his firm and the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Mansfield.\nS\necond-wave revitalization\nTanya Ragan earned the title of Downtown Dallas champion when she spruced up the Dallas Farmers Market a decade ago, breathing new life into the eastern edge of downtown. Her coalition, which included Dallas-based Spectrum Properties, turned four neglected sheds sitting on 17 underused acres into an open-air pavilion, a food hall, retail and multifamily.\nToday, a couple thousand people, including Ragan, call the neighborhood home. It\u2019s vibrant and walkable, with a slate of neighborhood restaurants. It also serves to connect downtown to nearby Deep Ellum.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018revitalization\u2019 because I feel like we\u2019re past that,\u201d she said.\nAnother wave of investment is on the way, this time on the southern and western edges of downtown. Stakeholders believe it\u2019ll be game-changing for the urban core as well as under-developed southern Dallas.\nThe city of Dallas, whose city manager didn\u2019t respond to requests for an interview, has 75 conventions already booked for its new convention center set to be delivered in 2029. The $3.7 billion project will overhaul Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center so that it features 750,000 square feet of exhibit space, 180,000 square feet of meeting rooms and a 105,000-square-foot ballroom. Dallas-based developer Matthews is doing the project.\nThe project is breeding optimism.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that people hang on and weather the storm,\u201d Craig Davis, president and CEO of VisitDallas, said.\nJust a few blocks north, Hunt Realty is pursuing a $5 billion project to redevelop downtown\u2019s quintessential Reunion Tower. The project could include up to 3,000 multifamily units, a 600- to 1,000-key hotel, 150,000 square feet of retail and up to 2 million square feet of office.\nBehind City Hall, Mike Hoque has also been assembling a 20-acre swath of land for a development he\u2019s calling Newpark, a mixed-use hub with an education and technology focus, according to plans.\nBut the ghosts of aborted and stalled projects haunt the road to downtown Dallas, and attempts to revitalize haven\u2019t always turned out. The Spire, a mixed-use district, was supposed to bloom on 11 acres at the corner of Ross Avenue and Routh Street but never did. Field Street District, another development planned for south of Woodall Rodgers Freeway, didn\u2019t get built\u00a0 yet either.\nW\nhere\u2019s Waldo?\nIn the story of downtown\u2019s troubles, the city\u2019s political leadership usually gets cast as villains.\nSome of it is earned. The closure announcement of the flagship Neiman Marcus store, like the threat of AT&amp;T leaving, seemed to have Dallas political leadership making decisions out of desperation. The city can mobilize, as it did with a series of press conferences putting pressure on Neiman Marcus\u2019 New York-based owner Saks Global, but it\u2019s been caught playing defense with both of these announcements.\nMeanwhile, Mayor Eric Johnson gets flak for his absence. The city\u2019s formerly Democratic leader (he switched parties mid-term) has missed so many city council meetings that it\u2019s prompted local news coverage. This combined with behavior like declaring Dallas a \u201cSanctuary City from Socialism\u201d has the editorial team at the Dallas Morning News concluding that he \u201cseems like the mayor of Somewhere Else.\u201d\nPrewitt said downtown dysfunction has more to do with the structure of city governance than leadership itself. The city has a \u201cweak mayor\u201d structure, which tips the balance of power to City Council, where Downtown is just a district with one vote, represented like any other slice of Dallas, despite its economic centrality.\nAs a result, the non-elected position of city manager gets elevated. Kimberly Bizor Tolbert was appointed to the role this year after serving as interim city manager since 2024. Developers and downtown stakeholders like her, praising her success in cutting the permit backlog and noting that she actually lives downtown.\nT\nhe balance\nRagan, Woods and Prewitt suspect that AT&amp;T\u2019s possible departure is more public relations spin than done deal.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the head of real estate, the smartest thing for you to do would be to put as much leverage on the city as possible to make the city that you\u2019re going to be staying in as good as possible,\u201d Prewitt said. \u201cThe best way to do that is to convince them you\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nWoods and Prewitt have quite a bit of skin in the game; they own the 1-million-square-foot building AT&amp;T fully occupies.\nPicking on the city\u2019s problem child gets results. Ray Washburne, the developer who owns Highland Park Village, threatened to plop a data center in the middle of downtown in February to get the city to pay a premium on the old Dallas Morning News building, which is adjacent to its convention center project.\nThe city caved, agreeing to buy the property in April for $45.1 million, a 61 percent premium on the $28 million Washburne paid in 2019.\nTriolet thinks downtown champions will be correct, at least in part. He predicts AT&amp;T will nab some space in the suburbs (it already has 186,000 square feet in Richardson) but will also keep a big chunk of office space downtown.\nRagan gets teased by her developer peers who claim her cheerleading for downtown is just a ploy to sell the Purse Building, an adaptive reuse project she listed recently\u00a0 for $12.5 million after priming it for eight years.\nIf Ragan\u2019s boosterism has the sheen of a sales pitch, it\u2019s for a product she\u2019s bought. After redeveloping the Farmers Market, Ragan bought a condo in the area, and her office is downtown across from Dealey Plaza.\nShe has words for the haters: \u201cI would say a lot of those people don\u2019t spend a lot of time down here anyway,\u201d she said.",

But another home trounced it on a per-square-foot basis.\nA trust affiliated with Matt Cwiertnia, partner at Ares Management, acquired actress Betty White\u2019s old house at 506 North Carmelina Avenue in an off-market deal for roughly $30.9 million on Feb. 11, or $10,203 per square foot. The home is not a personal purchase for Cwiertnia.\nBeyer\u2019s home, at 11740 Crescenda Street, sold for $2,200 per square foot.\nThe acquisition of 506 North Carmelina Avenue marks the priciest sale in Brentwood through Aug. 25, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data recently made available.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. You can see the top 10 single-family sales in Brentwood through Aug. 25 by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller of 506 North Carmelina Avenue, which clocks in at 3,029 square feet, was an entity linked to Soheil Moeini, president of Greystone Engineering Group.\nBuyer and seller agent information wasn\u2019t immediately available.\nLocated in Brentwood Park, 506 North Carmelina Avenue is gated and set back from the street on over three quarters of an acre with parklike grounds.\nThe \u201cGolden Girls\u201d star lived in the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home for\nmore than 50 years\nand died there on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2021 just shy of her 100th birthday.

        "content": "For months, real estate executives have poured millions of dollars into efforts to prevent Zohran Mamdani from becoming New York City\u2019s next mayor.\nIndustry players donated at least $13 million to political action committees backing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo or those simply opposing Mamdani, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThis money flowed as some in the industry warmed up to the idea of Mamdani becoming mayor, acknowledging that they supported elements of his housing plan and would\nwork closely\nwith him if he wins.\nTuesday will be the culmination of months of twists and turns in a race to replace Mayor Eric Adams at Gracie Mansion.\nMuch is at stake for real estate\n, which is losing a former\nally\nin City Hall and facing the prospect of a Democratic Socialist taking office. Some of the biggest policy fights over the last six years have played out between real estate groups and the Democratic Socialists of New York, and if Mamdani wins, the tension between the priorities of these frequent adversaries will be put to the test.\nStill, after winning the June primary, Mamdani\nmet with business leaders\nand emphasized points of common ground. He told The New Yorker that he is \u201cnot running to punish landlords.\u201d\nMamdani, the Democratic nominee, is considered the frontrunner, though\nsome recent polls\nshowed his lead over Cuomo shrinking.\nMost polls this month\nshow Mamdani with a 10-plus point lead. Republican Curtis Sliwa has polled at third place and has resisted calls to drop out of the race to give Cuomo a boost.\nHousing was a\nmajor issue\nin this election. Mamdani pledged to freeze rents for the city\u2019s one million stabilized apartments, a promise that is potentially threatened by the current mayor, who may appoint new members to the Rent Guidelines Board before he leaves office.\nLandlord groups argue that freezing rents cuts off one of the few remaining avenues that owners have to raise rents on stabilized housing, and will lead to further deterioration of this housing stock. In response to such concerns, Mamdani has said that he is committed to reforming the city\u2019s property tax system and exploring other forms of relief for landlords, including alternative forms of insurance. During the\nfinal mayoral debate\n, he said he wants to extend the property tax break J-51 to help owners with building renovations.\nHe also wants to build 200,000 new housing units over the next 10 years, funded by $70 billion in debt. To cover the debt service, he hopes to raise the corporate tax rate and add a 2 percent income tax on those making more than $1 million a year, changes that would require state action. Mamdani has also said he wants to make it easier for the private sector to build housing.\nCuomo\u2019s housing plan calls for building or preserving 500,000 homes over the next decade, funded in part by city pension funds. He has said he wants to initiate construction of such housing simultaneously across hundreds of sites, though\nit is not clear how this would be accomplished\n. He also wants to overhaul the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, pointing to the agency\u2019s backlog of housing projects.\nSliwa\u2019s housing plan focuses on converting empty office buildings into housing and filling up vacant stabilized units, rather than incentivizing the construction of new housing. He has repeatedly said he opposes the zoning changes under the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the centerpiece of the Adams administration\u2019s housing agenda, as well as the housing-related ballot measures.\nOn Tuesday, voters will also weigh in on several ballot questions to decide if the city\u2019s land use review process should be overhauled for certain housing projects. City Council leadership adamantly\nopposes\nthree of the questions, which in some cases remove the body\u2019s ability to review housing projects or allows an appeals board to override its rejection of a development.\nThe fate of these questions will likely determine how the next mayor approaches his housing agenda. Cuomo supports the measures, while Sliwa opposes them. Mamdani has not publicly\nrevealed\nwhere he stands on the measures.\nThese are the most contentious of the housing questions:\nShould the city create two \u201cfast track\u201d options for affordable housing projects?\nIf approved, this measure would allow the Board of Standards and Appeals to sign off on zoning changes for publicly-funded affordable housing. Such projects would not have to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nThe other fast-track option would apply to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Starting in October 2026, the city would release a report identifying which districts have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Such projects will go through a condensed Ulurp: Community Boards will have the same amount of time to review these proposals (60 days), but the applicable borough president will review the proposal at the same time, rather than for 30 days after the community board\u2019s review. The City Planning Commission, which will then have 30 days to review instead of 60, will have the final vote on these proposals, rather than the City Council.\nShould the city create a new land use review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing and infrastructure projects?\nThis new review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure or Elurp, would apply to housing projects in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent or to housing projects in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two. Proposals to put solar panels on public buildings or other land would also qualify.\nElurp would follow the same timeline outlined in the previous question, but depending on the project type, either the City Planning Commission or the City Council\u2019s review is skipped. (Some projects require review by the City Council under state law.)\nShould the city replace the mayoral veto with an appeals board?\nUlurp currently ends with the mayor, who usually goes along with whatever action the City Council takes (with a\nfew exceptions\n). This proposal would replace the mayor\u2019s power to veto land use decisions with a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and the applicable borough president. The appeals board could reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of projects that would create affordable housing. Such projects can only affect one borough. The appeals board can also restore such project proposals to the version approved by the City Planning Commission, undoing modifications approved by the City Council.\nA fourth housing proposal is decidedly less controversial:\nShould the city create a consolidated, digitized City Map?\nThe City Map is the official street map of the city and consists of more than 8,000 pieces of paper, administered across five borough presidents\u2019 offices. This proposal would create a single, digital map overseen by the Department of City Planning. The fragmented nature of the map has made city map changes \u201cperhaps the most feared ULURP actions among private applicants,\u201d according to the City Charter Revision Commission.\nThe final two questions are unrelated to housing:\nShould local elections take place the same year as presidential elections?\nThis would move elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and City Council to even years to coincide with presidential elections, in a bid to increase voter turnout.\nShould a constitutional amendment\nretroactively\napprove the use of 323 acres of parkland for winter sports?\nThis land in Adirondack Park was developed for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. The state\u2019s Olympic Regional Development Association developed the public land without a constitutional amendment, as required by law. So, the ballot proposal, if approved, would bring the area into compliance, allow improvements and approve the state\u2019s purchase of 2,500 acres of forest land to make up for the lost parkland.\n",

The solar energy will be used to partially power the amenities.\nLast year, Ytech\nsecured $104 million\nin financing for multiple Brickell properties, which included a $78 million refinancing from Linkvest Capital of the acquisition loan for the development site at 1428 Brickell Avenue.\nYtech\npaid $26.5 million\nfor the 1.1-acre property in early 2017, plus tens of millions of dollars more to settle claims and other issues, the developer said at the time.\nThe latest financing package marks the biggest Brickell condo construction loan this year. Even though condo presales have slowed across South Florida, and developers are dealing with a myriad of cost increases, a handful of developers have been able to secure large loans to move their projects forward.\nIn September, Newgard Group and Two Roads Development\nsecured a $513 million financing\npackage for their One Brickell Riverfront luxury condo complex that\u2019s under construction. The project includes the 44-story, 362-unit Lofty Brickell tower and the 46-story, 422-unit Standard Residences tower. They\u2019ll share a podium.\nAnd in April, PMG scored\na $413 million construction loan\nfor its planned two-tower One Twenty Brickell Residences at 120 Southwest Eighth Street. Ares Management and Monarch Alternative Capital are the lenders.\n",

        "content": "The longtime mayor of Coachella has been indicted in a conflict\nof interest case\nthat revolves around real estate developments and comes with charges of perjury.\nCoachella Mayor Steven Hernandez was\nindicted\non nine counts, including five felony charges, involving votes for projects in which he allegedly held financial interests, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Hernandez, who has served on the Coachella City Council for nearly two decades, faces more than seven years in state prison and a lifetime ban from public office if convicted as charged.\nThe indictment from a Riverside County criminal grand jury accuses Hernandez of several misdemeanors for leveraging his job as a public official to influence governmental decisions where he could receive financial gain. Some of those instances include votes cast between 2021 and 2023 to use funds from the pandemic-related\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act\nto renovate Coachella\u2019s downtown fire station. Hernandez is additionally accused of pushing votes on a commercial project known as Fountainhead Plaza, an\naffordable apartment community\ncalled the Tripoli Mixed-Use project and a transit hub near downtown.\nThe mayor has also been charged with a felony for \u201cwillfully and unlawfully\u201d approving a contract in which he had a financial interest. The charge stems from when he voted for an agreement between the City of Coachella and the\nCoachella Valley\nAssociation of Governments\u2019 Housing First program aimed to serve homeless people.\nHe also faces four felony counts of perjury related to claims he made on his Statement of Economic Interests public disclosure forms, also known as Form 700, which makes public any potential financial interests in projects. In total, the indictment named 13 witnesses who testified in front of the grand jury, including a sitting City Council member, the city\u2019s economic development director, a former council member and a former city manager.\nThe Coachella Valley Association of Governments is fully cooperating with the district attorney\u2019s office and grand jury. \u201cThere has never been an implication from investigators that the investigation had anything to do with actions by elected officials serving in their [Coachella Valley Association of Governments] capacity,\u201d a spokesperson told the Times.\nHernandez\u2019s attorney, A. Alexander Lowder of the law firm Larson, confirmed that he and his client are seeking to remedy the issue. \u201cWe recognize the serious nature of these charges and will be working with our client to resolve the matter,\u201d Lowder said following the indictment coming down.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Marc Calabria is scooping up another piece of Chicago\u2019s architectural history, marking his second major downtown purchase in the past month.\nThe 18-story Railway Exchange Building at 224 South Michigan Avenue \u2014 once home to seminal architect Daniel Burnham \u2014 is under contract to sell to a venture led by Calabria, according to people familiar with the deal, Costar\nreported\n.\nHe recently paid $4.2 million for the vacant, William Le Baron Jenney\u2013designed building at 401 South State Street, about two blocks away. Burnham and Jenney were pivotal in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871 and helped lay the foundation for the modern skyscraper.\nIt\u2019s unclear what\nCalabria\n\u2014 who leads Bloomingdale-based IMC Accounting &amp; Tax \u2014 plans for either property, or how much he\u2019s paying for the Burnham-designed landmark. He did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet.\nCalabria is no stranger to adaptive reuse. He\u2019s a partner in the planned conversion of part of the 41-story Clark Adams Building at\n105 West Adams Street\ninto 400 apartments.\nThe off-market deal continues the turbulent recent history of the\nRailway Exchange Building\n, a 1904 Burnham design known for its white terra cotta fa\u00e7ade and glass atrium. The University of Notre Dame handed the property back to its lender, a New York Life Insurance subsidiary, in January through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The university had owned the property for nearly 20 years and refinanced it with a $47.5 million loan in 2015, according to Cook County records.\nNew York Life declined to comment on the transaction. The building, across from Grant Park, is about 37 percent vacant, according to CoStar. It still houses marquee architecture firms\nSkidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill\nand Goettsch Partners, both spiritual descendants of Burnham\u2019s visionary urbanism.\nBurnham himself worked from an upper floor overlooking Lake Michigan until his death in 1912. The building was commissioned by the Santa Fe Railroad to host multiple rail companies \u2014 a logical assignment for Burnham, fresh off designing the \u201cWhite City\u201d for the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The company has been purportedly touring offices in Mountain View, but hasn\u2019t yet settled on a place to call home.\nOpenAI has\ngrown its campus\nin San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay quite a bit in recent years. In 2023, the Sam Altman-led firm subleased nearly half a million square feet of offices from Uber at 1455 and 1515 3rd Street in Mission Bay. The following year, OpenAI grabbed all 315,000 square feet of space next door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard.\nIn planting a flag in Silicon Valley, the company would be closer to top engineering talent, allowing it to grow its head count. In March, company executives\ncommitted\nto doubling its current San Francisco-based workforce of 2,000 people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always exploring how to grow our presence in a way that works best for our people and our mission,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told the Business Times of the Silicon Valley office search.\nWhile\nartificial intelligence companies have been growing in San Francisco\nin recent years, more have been expanding in Silicon Valley. Companies like Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic and Scale AI have ramped up their search for employees in Santa Clara County, with the county\u2019s share of AI job postings in the region jumping to 8.3 percent from 3.4 percent over the past three years, per Lightcast data cited by the Business Times. San Francisco retains the lion\u2019s share, but that\u2019s fallen from 96 percent to 91 percent over the same period.\nThe trend has seen the office markets in various cities and submarkets around the Bay Area humming back to life as\ntenant demand\nreaches its highest level in more than three years. Of those searching for new offices, more than half of demand is from tech and AI companies.\nElon Musk\u2019s xAI, for example,\njust expanded in Palo Alto\nnear Tesla\u2019s engineering hub and is looking to grow more in the Silicon Valley city. AI startup\nDatabricks similarly grabbed 305,000 square feet\nof offices in Sunnyvale earlier this year while expanding its San Francisco headquarters.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The bank has opened roughly 70 branches since 2018 and marked its 200th earlier this year in Pflugerville, north of Austin.\nGreen said the September rate cut \u2014 made independently of the\nFederal Reserve\n\u2014 has spurred home mortgage and refinancing lending, a rare boost in a market slowed by high borrowing costs.\n\u201cWe struck a nerve on the refinance point,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing refinance activity in addition to purchase money activity.\u201d He added that many customers with adjustable-rate mortgages are shifting to fixed-rate loans before resets hit.\nWhile mergers have reshaped Texas\u2019 banking landscape, Green said Frost isn\u2019t looking to buy rivals.\n\u201cWe believe our organic growth success is at the top end of the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can do it yourself, you spend a third to half less than what you\u2019d pay in an acquisition.\u201d\nThe 155-year-old lender is leaning on a combination of technology upgrades, high-touch service and selective new branches \u2014 a formula Green said has proven scalable and cost-effective.\nThat strategy is reflected in Frost\u2019s strong third-quarter results, released last week.\nThe bank\u2019s net income rose 19 percent year-over-year to $172.7 million, or $2.67 per share, beating Wall Street forecasts by 29 cents.\nNet interest income climbed 9 percent to $463.7 million as the bank\u2019s margin widened to 3.69 percent. Average loans grew 6.8 percent to $21.5 billion, deposits rose 3.3 percent to $42.1 billion, and credit quality improved sharply with nonperforming loans dropping 57 percent to $44.8 million \u2014 the lowest level since before the pandemic.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That pushed year-to-date demand to 33.7 million square feet, already eclipsing last year\u2019s total. If the pace holds, 2025 could mark the first time since 2019 that annual leasing activity tops 40 million square feet.\nThe month\u2019s largest lease was a 377,000-square-foot short-term extension by Ropes &amp; Gray at Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge and RXR\u2019s\n1211 Sixth Avenue\n, per Colliers. The law firm has plans to relocate to RXR\u2019s 1285 Sixth Avenue.\nFintech firm Stripe inked the second-largest lease at Fosun International\u2019s\n28 Liberty Street\n, a 139,000-square-foot expansion. Brokerage BGC Group inked a 129,000-square-foot renewal and expansion at\n55 Water Street\n, owned by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, marking the month\u2019s third-largest lease.\nOther large leases include law firm BakerHostetler\u2019s 115,000 renewal and relocation at Tishman Speyer\u2019s 45 Rockefeller Plaza, and a new 103,000-square-foot sublease by investment firm Sixth Street at Tishman\u2019s Spiral building in Hudson Yards, according to Colliers.\nAs tenants gobbled up space, availability fell to 14.3 percent, the lowest since late 2020. Sublet space dropped for the 13th consecutive month, down 730,000 square feet to 11.8 million, dipping to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since March 2020.\nMidtown held steady with 1.5 million square feet leased. Availability there tightened to 13 percent as large blocks of space came off the market. The average asking rents rose to about $81 per foot, the highest in nearly five years. Midtown South saw the biggest surge. Leasing there jumped 78 percent from September to 1.4 million square feet.\n",

Nussbaum and Associates revealed creditors were seeking to collect more than $400 million from Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, according to new court filings.\nThe amount of creditors\u2019 claims had not been previously known. Nussbaum\u2019s firms are undergoing an alternative to bankruptcy, known as\nassignment for the benefit of creditors\n, to liquidate assets and repay creditors.\nThe fiduciary is now seeking to obtain a judge\u2019s approval to hire new forensic accountants, citing \u201climited formalized records, books and ledgers\u201d of Nussbaum\u2019s law firms.\n\u201cThe lion\u2019s share of the assets and the (Nussbaum) estate\u2019s value likely must be derived through the tracing of banking records and contemporaneous communications,\u201d said Sheldon Eisenberger in a recent filing in New York State Supreme Court.\nThe creditors are seeking repayment on funds they advanced to Nussbaum\u2019s law firms. Nussbaum is hoping to resolve these claims in civil court, while also facing criminal charges of grand larceny from the\nManhattan District Attorney\u2019s office\nover missing escrow funds. (Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty).\nNussbaum was a real estate transactional attorney with an office in Manhattan. He began using his law firm\u2019s escrow accounts into a conduit for bridge loans. and used investor money to lend to real estate dealmakers. In turn, the investors would make a return and Nussbaum would collect a fee for facilitating the transaction, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nBut in January, Nussbaum started running a deficit and stopped paying investors.\nNursing home executive Jacob Sod filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, alleging Nussbaum had failed to return $15 million. Lawsuits started piling up as Nussbaum\u2019s clients sought to recoup their money.\nIn a short time, Nussbaum closed his law firm, Nussbaum Lowinger. Instead of resolving the dispute through bankruptcy, he opted to go through an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, or an ABC.\nAs part of the ABC process, Nussbaum appointed attorney Sheldon Eisenberger to act as a fiduciary to liquidate Nussbaum\u2019s assets to pay back creditors. The process is still ongoing.\nNussbaum\u2019s largest asset is reportedly his accounts receivable, which is related to outstanding debts or loans he provided to real estate dealmakers. Nussbaum is accused of using a tactic referred to as \u201cshow capital,\u201d in which he would temporarily deposit money into a real estate dealmaker\u2019s account to make it appear as if the dealmaker was capitalized.\nNussbaum also owned\nreal estate in Chicago\n. But many of those assets, consisting of small multifamily residential properties in Chicago\u2019s South and West Side, have fallen into foreclosure.\nUntangling the web of entities and transactions connected to Nussbaum has proven to be a challenge.\nEisenberger is seeking to appoint Patrick A. Chylinski and David Harkavy of Armanino Advisory as forensic accountants to help trace Nussbaum\u2019s assets and transactions.\nArmanino Advisory\u2019s responsibilities include: conducting a forensic analysis of Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s books and records, preparing a fraudulent conveyance analysis, and possibly filing tax returns, according to Eisenberger\u2019s filing.\nNussbaum\u2019s attorney did not return a request for comment. Eisenberger also did not return a request for comment.\n",

It started construction of the second tower in September and expects to complete it in 2028, according to the release.\nThe loans replace\n$195 million\nin financing that Scale provided for the project in 2022.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the towers will be connected up to the eighth floor and have a shared 269-space garage. The project also will have 7,100 square feet of ground-floor retail and 62,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities on the seventh and eighth floors.\nThe towers will consist of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, according to the release.\nNamdar is led by Ephraim and Joel Namdar, according to state corporate records.\nIn August, the firm also scored a\n$358 million\nfinancing package for its project with more than 1,100 units at 29 Van Reipen Avenue and 612 Pavonia Avenue in Jersey City\u2019s Journal Square neighborhood in New Jersey.\nNew York-based Slate Property is a multifamily investment, development and management firm led by\nMartin Nussbaum\nand David Schwartz, according to its website. Since it was founded in 2013, it has developed and invested in more than 17,000 units and completed $8.8 billion in deals.\nScale has financed a few South Florida projects.

        "content": "Real estate executives poured millions of dollars into PACs opposing Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor. Tuesday will determine if these efforts paid off.\nIndustry professionals donated at least $13 million to political action committees either backing Andrew Cuomo or more generally opposing Mamdani, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis of filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board through Oct. 28.\nRoughly half of that went to the pro-Cuomo PAC, Fix the City, but a majority of donations from the industry to that PAC came in before the June primary. As I\u2019ve\npreviously reported\n, the industry backed away from Cuomo after the primary and some opened their checkbooks for Mayor Eric Adams. When it\nbecame clear\nthat Adams\u2019 campaign could not gain enough momentum, some turned back to Cuomo.\nFor example, Extell Development\u2019s Gary Barnett gave Fix the City $260,000 before the primary. He contributed $250,000 to a pro-Eric Adams PAC in July. Then, last month, he gave Fix the City $100,000 and another $180,000 to Defend NYC, an anti-Mamdani PAC.\nPost-primary, donations have flowed to PACs opposing Mamdani. Kamson Corporation\u2019s Richard Kurtz gave $100,000 to the Anyone But Mamdani PAC, and Himmel and Meringoff Properties\u2019 Stephen Meringoff contributed $10,000. Lightstone Real Estate Partners and Midtown Equities\u2019 Joseph Cayre were the top real estate donors to another anti-Mamdani PAC, New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25, respectively contributing $150,000 and $100,000.\nAdditionally, industry executives have contributed to Put NYC First, a group that has given anti-Mamdani and pro-Cuomo PACs upwards of\n$7.6 million\n. For example, the group gave Stop the Socialists, a pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani and anti-Curtis Sliwa PAC, $1 million.\nThe city\u2019s Campaign Finance website lists Infinite Global Real Estate Partners\u2019 Marty Burger and Mack Real Estate Group\u2019s Richard Mack among Put NYC First\u2019s leaders.\nMack, Island Capital\u2019s Andrew Farkas and RFR Holding\u2019s Aby Rosen each gave the group $250,000. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia donated $1 million.\nAirbnb gave $10 million to Affordable New York, a PAC that spent $440,533 on ads opposing Mamdani ahead of the June primary.\nPro-Mamdani PACs received about $82,000 from real estate professionals. Most of that came from Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman, who gave\n$50,000\nto New Yorkers for Lower Costs in June.\nVoters will decide Tuesday who will\nsucceed\nMayor Eric Adams. Campaign and PAC donations can only tell us so much about the race, though they show that some in the real estate industry hoped that ramping up spending could help whittle down Mamdani\u2019s significant lead over Cuomo. Donations also reflect that the industry\nisn\u2019t a monolith\n\u2014 some, including affordable housing developers, have donated to Mamdani\u2019s campaign and have spoken favorably about his housing plans.\nWe\u2019ll see where things land Tuesday!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I\u2019ll be covering the election results. If you\u2019d like to share your reaction to the race, please send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: There are\neight different cuts\nof the 1982 film \u201cBladerunner.\u201d The one originally released in theaters included a voiceover, mandated by studio executives before its release.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Police say a Brooklyn man parachuted off the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on Sunday as the bridge was reopened to traffic after the New York City marathon,\nGothamist reports\n. Jonathan Warren, 40, parachuted to Calvert Vaux Park in Bath Beach, about two miles away from the bridge, according to police. He faces a reckless endangerment charge.\n\u2014 President Donald Trump\ntold CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\nthat, between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, who he respectively referred to as a \u201cbad Democrat\u201d and \u201ca communist,\u201d his pick for mayor is the former governor. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\u201d he said. On Monday, Cuomo rejected the idea that Trump\u2019s comments amounted to an endorsement,\namNY reports\n.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday canvassed in support of the housing ballot measures, which would overhaul the city\u2019s land use review process for some housing projects.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$8.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 11 Beach Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,200 square feet and new construction.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nJohn Gomes, Fredrik Eklund and Terry Martinolle have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$29 million\nfor 6-8 East 82nd Street. The Metropolitan Museum of Art sold the two townhouse buildings, which are 13,000 square feet combined.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nCarrie Chiang and Andres Perea-Garzon have the listing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $34 million for 121 East 65th Street. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 9,400 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 49,070-square-foot, 15-story, 65-unit, mixed-use building at 2730 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Architect Nikolai Katz is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "Toby Moskovits\nand Michael Lichtenstein, once-prolific Brooklyn developers whose partnership came unraveled under the\nweight of debts\nthey couldn\u2019t pay, have been charged with fraudulently trying to obtain $5 million in Covid-era government loans.\nThey\u2019re accused of using forgiven payroll loans to pay their lawyers, architects and even a hat shop.\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York charged the developers on October 27 with three counts of fraud related to the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.\n\u201cAfter obtaining funds from these programs, Lichtenstein and Moskovits used most of the funds for purposes that were not permitted by the programs and lied about doing so,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their indictment.\nInstead of using the monies to pay employees and for working capital, prosecutors allege Moskovits and Lichtenstein used the funds \u201cto pay lawyers, architecture firms, a real estate lender, a real estate and titles services company, and for expenses\u201d related to a residential development in the Bronx.\nProsecutors said the duo fraudulently obtained $1.9 million in loans and tried to get another $3.1 million between March 2020 and April 2022.\nIn 2020, the developers got a $1.4 million PPP loan through their hotel management company from a bank and used the money to pay $15,000 to a real estate attorney and another $10,000 to an architecture firm, according to prosecutors. Then they submitted a forgiveness application saying the money was used for eligible payroll costs, which was approved by the Small Business Administration.\nIn 2021, they applied for another $2 million loan, with Moskovits explaining, \u201cWe need the PPP funds in order to get through this difficult period and pay the salaries of the 90 people that rely on us for their living wages.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the first PPP loan that [the Hotel Management Company] received, all of it went to pay people\u2019s salaries and to cover payroll. None of it went for other purposes,\u201d she told her bank.\nBut prosecutors say that just wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cIn fact, Lichtenstein and Moskovits had used less than half of the 2020 PPP loan to \u2018to pay people\u2019s salaries and to cover payroll,\u2019\u201d they allege.\nThe bank ultimately denied the loan on the grounds that Moskovits and Lichtenstein had not disclosed their interest in the hotel company in connection with the previous loan.\nRepresentatives for Moskovits and Lichtenstein could not be immediately reached for comment.\nMoskovits, an Orthodox Jewish single mother of three, worked in Israel\u2019s tech venture capital industry and then turned to real estate during the Great Recession, emerging as one of Brooklyn\u2019s\nbiggest builders\n.\nShe built a reputation by developing ambitious projects in relatively untested neighborhoods, including the\n147-key Williamsburg Hotel\nand\n25 Kent\n\u2014 a 500,000-square-foot office complex that was the first ground-up commercial development in Williamsburg in more than 40 years.\nBut Heritage Equity has come under duress in recent years.\nThey\nlost their Williamsburg Hotel\nin 2023 in bankruptcy.\n",

        "content": "A 1920s duplex in Arlington Heights is poised to become a fully affordable housing development.\nGrace Kwok of Crane Canyon filed an application to build a five-story, 52-unit residential building on the site, at 2100 South Crenshaw Boulevard in Arlington Heights, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe latest proposal builds on a\n2022 application from Kwok\nseeking to redevelop the parcel into a five-story building with 17 units. The project aimed to tap\nTransit Oriented Communities\ndevelopment incentives to build a larger structure than what zoning allows. In exchange, the development would\u2019ve designated three apartments for affordable housing.\nNow the developer is going all in on affordable housing by using\nMayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1\n, which streamlines and expedites applications for multifamily proposals that seek to build 100 percent affordable housing projects.\nThe Crenshaw Boulevard building is being designed by PDS Studio. It\u2019s near a construction site for a four-story, 31-unit apartment building with ground-floor retail at the northeast corner of Washington Boulevard and Norton Avenue.\nED1 has increasingly become the go-to conduit for multifamily construction in Los Angeles as\ndevelopers lean away from market-rate housing construction\n.\nThe ordinance was enacted in late 2022, and as of this August, developers had submitted proposals for 35,000 ED1-backed units and secured approvals for about 29,000. That dwarfs the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\nMarket-rate housing construction \u201chas been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak Capital,\ntold\nCoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nWhile developers might be doubling down on fully affordable projects, Los Angeles is still behind on its\nhousing element\n. The city must permit 456,643 new units by 2029; of those, 184,721 must be set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But the dispute adds another layer to Zillow\u2019s rules that were largely brought as a reaction to\noffice-exclusive listings by brokerages like Compass\n.\n\u201cMRED issued a notice to our managing brokers after receiving reports that some had been informed their active listings may not appear on Zillow if they had previously been in MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network,\u201d MRED CEO Rebecca Jensen said in a statement.\nZillow has been working with MRED for months to address the dispute, a Zillow spokesperson said. The company has not sent any warnings to agents about their listings and has only reached out to managing brokers. Elsewhere, Zillow began enforcing the rules in June.\n\u201cWe have been attempting to work with them since the spring and have not yet sent listing access violations in MRED,\u201d a Zillow spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis is a play for MRED to protect its own private listing network. Hidden listing schemes disadvantage sellers and buyers, and that\u2019s what this is.\u201d\nThe Zillow spokesperson also said 30 percent of buyers searching in Chicago are searching from outside the area, meaning they may not have a local broker and won\u2019t see listings on the private network.\nIn its internal message, MRED defended the PLN and warned Zillow may violate its licensing agreement with MRED if it withholds certain listings from its website. The agreement \u201crequires Zillow to access and display all licensed listings without bias or restriction,\u201d MRED said.\n\u201cMRED takes seriously our responsibility to license your data and to ensure that every company receiving that data complies fully with its license obligations,\u201d the message said.\nMRED has held up the PLN, launched in 2016, as a fairer alternative to office exclusive listings that are fully off the MLS. It is also largely backed by supporters and opponents of Clear Cooperation Policy alike as a way to keep listings out of public channels but ensure they are seen by all the brokers in the market. Buyers working with a Chicago broker can also use an app called Zenlist to see PLN listings.\nCompass\nfiled a lawsuit\nagainst Zillow over the new standards in June, which hinted at the dispute playing out now. Compass\u2019 initial complaint recounted a meeting between Compass CEO Robert Reffkin and Zillow executives. In the meeting, Reffkin brought up MRED\u2019s private listing network while defending Compass\u2019 network. Zillow Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Hofmann said Zillow \u201cwill no longer allow that to happen,\u201d according to the complaint.\nZillow\u2019s rules state that a listing must be entered into the MLS and available to be published on Zillow within one business day of being publicly marketed, closely mirroring the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy. However, Clear Cooperation Policy allows MLS-wide private listing services like MRED\u2019s.\nZillow considers public marketing to include \u201cmulti-brokerage private listing networks\u201d and \u201cmarketing or sharing listings through any network that involves multiple brokerages,\u201d which appears to be where the policy conflicts with the PLN.\nListings that are made only on the private listing network and not marketed elsewhere or later shared online in line with Zillow\u2019s standards, according to the Frequently Asked Questions section on Zillow\u2019s website. So only listings that move from private to public, or are private but advertised through social media or a brokerage\u2019s website, would violate the rules.\nZillow\u2019s standards say that it will give brokers warnings for their first and second listing that violate the rules without taking them down. The third non-compliant listing will be blocked from Zillow, along with any further non-compliant listings. Any future listings from the same broker that don\u2019t violate the rules won\u2019t be blocked.\nNeither company said definitively what its next move is. Zillow did not say when it will begin enforcing its listing standards in Chicago, and MRED offered no specific details on its plans for the PLN.\nThad Wong, the co-founder of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, said MRED is \u201cstanding up for its professionals\u201d by defending the PLN. Wong, whose firm was bought by Compass in 2024, has\nopposed Clear Cooperation Policy\nand argued private listings give sellers more choice in how they sell their home.\n\u201cWhile some MLSs have chosen to align with portals that promote a one-size-fits-all model, MRED is championing innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition,\u201d Wong said in a statement provided by a spokesperson.\n",

        "content": "Embattled New York-based attorney\nMark Nussbaum\nand his deal partner, Eli Tauber, are now the subject of a combined 29 foreclosure lawsuits for real estate across the South and West sides of Chicago all filed within the last five months.\nLenders allege that Nussbaum \u2014 who\u2019s under indictment by the Manhattan District Attorney for alleged grand larceny tied to missing escrow funds\u00a0 \u2014 and Tauber are behind on payments toward a cumulative $24 million of mortgages backed by Chicago multifamily properties.\nBased on the court flings, Tauber and Nussbaum\u2019s dealings appear to show a larger trend in the South and West sides of Chicago. Properties were purchased multiple times among a circle of investors based in New York and New Jersey and in many cases, sales of the same properties made in quick succession have dramatically increased their values. In some cases, Tauber and Nussbaum took out debt together and in other cases they did so independently, legal filings show. Even when Nussbaum\u2019s name doesn\u2019t appear on a mortgage it sometimes shows up in other documents related to the same property.\nAs Nussbaum\u2019s multifamily portfolio begins to crumble, legal filings show how a group of run-down apartment buildings in some of Chicago\u2019s poorest neighborhoods can become ensnared in an ever-expanding web of New York real estate drama.\nThe Department of Justice and the overseer of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have been zeroing in on flips or sales between related parties and have already taken down some East Coast real estate players. Many of those at the center of the DOJ\u2019s investigation have ties to\nLakewood, New Jersey\n.\nSome conspirators, including Eli and Aron Puretz,\nMoshe Silber\n, Fred Schulman and Boruch Drillman, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nThe DOJ has not brought any criminal charges or allegations of wrongdoing against Nussbaum and there is no known investigation into Nussbaum\u2019s transactions in Chicago.\nBut he is dealing with his own slate of legal troubles.\nNussbaum\u2019s financial woes started earlier this year. He used his law firm\u2019s escrow services as a pass-through to provide bridge loans to real estate dealmakers. By doing so, he raked in a fee, his clients made money and real estate owners scored quick loans to close deals.\nAt some point, however, Nussbaum started running a deficit. A nursing home executive named Jacob Sod filed a lawsuit demanding Nussbaum return $15 million in escrow money. Others followed suit and Nussbaum shut down his law firm in January.\nIn May, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office charged Nussbaum with grand larceny, alleging he took over $15 million in client escrow money. And there may be additional victims, the D.A.\u2019s office said at the time. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $500,000 bond.\nThe latest foreclosures\nThe latest batch of 12 Chicago foreclosure lawsuits to hit Nussbaum and Tauber were filed within the last few weeks. Wilmington Trust, acting as a trustee for creditors, filed all but one of the most recent foreclosure complaints against the duo. All of them allege that either Nussbaum, Tauber or both have been in default on loans tied to the properties since February or March of this year.\nThe city of Chicago issued an additional complaint in July against Tauber regarding a series of unaddressed code violations at 2814 East 78th Street in the South Shore neighborhood. The complaint alleges that the building, which Tauber bought for $1 million in 2024, is currently vacant and \u201crapidly becoming dangerous.\u201d\nAnother property facing foreclosure, 1135 West Garfield Boulevard, had been subject to a particularly extreme flip. In just one year, the sale price of the 9,000-square-foot West Garfield building more than tripled from $245,000 to $875,000.\nA Lakewood-based company called CMP Trading initially bought the building in March 2022. A week later, CMP flipped the property to Myer Kahan of Lakewood for $420,000, a 71 percent increase. The same day Kahan scored a $315,000 loan \u2014 more than CMP Trading had laid down.\nThe property had code violations including a bathroom floor collapsing, fractures on the building\u2019s exterior and cracks on the staircase.\nA year after the flip, Nussbaum\u2019s name started to appear on documents related to 1135 West Garfield. An LLC controlled by Nussbaum then took control of the property for $875,000 through a special warranty deed, and secured a loan from Roc Capital, a lender specializing in fix-and-flip loans, for $770,000.\nThe new sale price was more than double the property\u2019s value a year earlier. Chicago records do not list any building permits, suggesting there were no substantial repairs or improvements.\nLast summer, Nussbaum\u2019s LLC cleared the violations with the city, then secured a $1.1 million loan from Cliffco Mortgage Lenders, an amount 25 percent larger than the last sale price. This time, Eliazer Tauber signed for the loan to the LLC, instead of Nussbaum.\nNow, the building is facing a foreclosure lawsuit from Wilmington, which claims Nussbaum hasn\u2019t made payments toward the building\u2019s mortgage since February.\nNussbaum\u2019s other transactions in Chicago follow a similar pattern, showing sudden increases in sales prices in an otherwise difficult market.\nRepresentatives for Wilmington declined to comment and Nussbaum, Tauber and the other building\u2019s lenders did not respond to requests for comment.\nAn ever expanding web\nAs more foreclosures come in, Nussbaum\u2019s efforts to address his financial problems highlight his connection to other high profile real estate players who are also facing trouble.\nIn June, a month after Nussbaum was charged with grand larceny, his law firms, Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum Associates, filed a petition in New York Supreme Court to start a process known as an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (ABC). The process is an alternative to bankruptcy, considered a faster and less bureaucratic process than Chapter 7 or 11.\nDetails about Nussbaum\u2019s total debts and assets remain a mystery. An ABC is not overseen by a bankruptcy judge, but rather an \u201cassignee\u201d who acts as a liquidator and is appointed by Nussbaum.\nThrough the process,\ncreditors are seeking to collect $400 million\nfrom Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms. Nussbaum reportedly still has tens of millions of dollars owed to him on loans he made. If he can collect on those, he could repay at least some of his creditors.\nNussbaum worked with some of the New York tri-state area\u2019s largest dealmakers, including Shaya Prager and Joel Schreiber, and he\u2019s seeking to resolve some of his issues with former clients via the ABC process.\nPrager is facing financial distress in\nTexas and across the Midwest\n, after\nspending billions buying up suburban office properties\n.\nNussbaum\u2019s ABC process could also include going after any debts owed by the estate of the late Mendel Steiner, with whom Nussbaum once allegedly worked closely. Steiner died by suicide in January as lawsuits started piling up. Nussbaum\u2019s attorney has alleged the $15 million that nursing home executive Sod sued him over went to a company affiliated with Steiner.\n",

        "content": "Cook County leaders clinched a rare win on property taxes in Springfield, as lawmakers approved a measure expanding tax relief for\nlow-income seniors\n\u2014 a move that could shift costs elsewhere and add fuel to the county\u2019s political battles ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\nThe bill, passed in the closing hours of the fall legislative session, raised the income threshold for the state\u2019s \u201csenior freeze\u201d program to $75,000 starting with 2027 tax bills, up from $65,000 in Cook County and $55,000 elsewhere, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe break, which freezes the taxable value of a home for qualifying seniors, was designed to shield those on fixed incomes from rising assessments and property taxes. Lawmakers also linked the same income limit to the state\u2019s senior deferral loan program, which allows participants to borrow against future home sales to pay their bills.\nThe measure is a major win for Cook County Board President\nToni Preckwinkle\nand Assessor\nFritz Kaegi\n, both of whom face primary challengers next March. Kaegi framed the change as protection against seniors \u201closing their homes because of unmanageable property tax increases.\u201d But his bid to make the tax freeze automatic failed.\nThe legislation also gives\nCounty Clerk Monica Gordon\nauthority to create payment plans for owners trying to redeem delinquent taxes sold at auction \u2014 a tool aimed at keeping low-income homeowners from losing their properties.\nOpposition came from the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association, which warned the expanded freeze would push more of the burden onto homeowners already hit hard by double-digit increases this year.\nMedian residential bills in some south suburbs jumped nearly 20 percent last year, with spikes surpassing that in towns such as Markham, Hazel Crest and Calumet Park. The association\u2019s executive director, Kristi DeLaurentiis, argued that Cook County is underestimating how many will qualify under the new limits and that even small increases in property value will drive up tax bills.\nCounty officials countered that the impact will be modest, citing University of Illinois at Chicago data suggesting any uptick in rates would be gradual and minimal. The bill also pushes the due date for the county\u2019s spring installment bills from March 1 to April 1, giving taxpayers an extra month between\npayments\n.\nThat scheduling change caps a chaotic property tax season marked by delays, a budget hearing blowup, and public feuding among county officials.\nTreasurer Maria Pappas, up for reelection alongside Kaegi and Preckwinkle, threatened to hold back first installment bills \u201cno matter what anyone tells me\u201d as tensions flared over delays tied to a long-troubled billing system overhaul by Tyler Technologies.\nFor now, only 11,000 parcels still show calculation errors, and officials say tax data should be ready for printing this week.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

As a result, most development proposals would be automatically greenlit, including those that break local height limits or threaten rent-controlled units.\nThe California Housing Defense Fund, which sues municipalities over noncompliant zoning, has already threatened legal action against the City of San Francisco. Pro-housing advocacy group YIMBY Action is urging the state\u2019s Housing and Community Development Department to spell out what San Francisco must do to fix its plan to meet the\nstate mandate\n, currently set at 82,000 new units by 2031.\nIf California\u2019s Housing and Community Development Department mandates changes, it could help local elected officials look better to residents as the order comes down from the Capitol.\n\u201cIt makes it a lot easier, if you\u2019re a politician, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t love this, but Sacramento is making me do it,\u2019\u201d Natoli said.\nThat could help groups such as YIMBY Action as they push for revisions to San Francisco\u2019s latest rezoning plan.\n\u201cIt gives us cover to do more,\u201d\nYIMBY Action organizing director Jane Natoli\nsaid. \u201c[Egan\u2019s] report, when you dig into it, says, \u2018This is necessary but not sufficient.\u2019\u201d\nSan Francisco Planning Director Sarah Dennis Phillips\nnoted that while Egan\u2019s report claims the city risks state intervention and builder\u2019s remedy, the Family Zoning Plan would bring rents down.\nStill, the City has opened itself up to legal action that could force builder\u2019s remedy down locals\u2019 throats.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d Natoli said of a possible lawsuit. \u201cAt a certain point, this issue is going to need to be litigated.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "What started as a routine contest to replace a retiring state senator for part of\nTarrant County\nhas erupted into one of Texas\u2019 most expensive and divisive races this year, and it comes down to the battle for legal gambling in the state.\nSenate District 9, which voters will decide Tuesday, has become a proxy war between Sands Casino\u2019s eagerness to legalize gambling and conservative power brokers determined to stop them, KXAS\nreported\n.\nThe northern Tarrant County district \u2014 mapped to favor Republicans \u2014 has turned into a high-dollar brawl between conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss and former Southlake Mayor John Huffman, who diverge on a major issue: whether Texans should vote on casino expansion.\nWambsganss \u2014 a Patriot Mobile executive with backing from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and President Donald Trump \u2014 argues that gambling giants are trying to \u201cbuy Texas politics.\u201d Her campaign has labeled Huffman a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of the\nLas Vegas Sands\n, whose billionaire Adelson family, owner of the\nDallas Mavericks\n, has poured more than $1.2 million directly into his campaign and paid for another $2 million in ads.\nHuffman, a real estate developer endorsed by\nFort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker\nand State Rep. Charlie Geren, calls it a matter of voter choice.\n\u201cTexans can decide for themselves whether they want destination resorts,\u201d he said, noting that the\nAdelsons\nare longtime donors to top Republican leaders, including Trump and Cruz.\nHe fired back at Wambsganss over her husband\u2019s past involvement in charitable gaming, calling her attacks hypocritical.\nThe mudslinging has turned personal. A doctored image depicting Wambsganss with a satanic symbol circulated late in the race, prompting her to call it \u201cdemonic.\u201d Patrick defended her and blamed Huffman, whose campaign denied involvement.\nBehind the theatrics lies a larger fight looming over Austin next session. Casino operators, led by Sands, plan to push for a constitutional amendment allowing resort-style casinos \u2014 a move that requires two-thirds support in both chambers and voter approval statewide.\nPatrick, who controls the Senate agenda, has said it lacks the votes.\nA third candidate, Democrat Taylor Rehmet, a machinist and former union leader, hopes to capitalize on the GOP infighting. He supports casino expansion if it brings \u201cgood union-paying jobs\u201d and pledges to focus on workers\u2019 rights and higher wages.\nEarly voting has ended, and with millions already spent, the outcome could determine not only who represents Tarrant County but also whether Texas ever rolls the dice on casinos.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Canadian buyers are retreating from high-end South Florida markets, driven by the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies and a softer exchange rate, even as Latin American demand remains strong.\nCanada\u2019s share of foreign buyers shopping for U.S. homes online has dropped to 32.1 percent in the third quarter, from 36.6 percent in the same period of last year, according to a new report from Realtor.com. Still, Canada remains the top source of international buyers in the U.S.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Senada Ad\u017eem, who handles luxury listings and sales in Palm Beach County, said that currency fluctuations and trade war volatility are factors. She called it \u201cunusual\u201d that she is seeing an uptick in Canadian sellers and a decline in Canadian buyers, referring to the $10 million-plus market.\n\u201cWe all love our Canadian clients and friends. There is this perception that generally because of the trade negotiations that they\u2019re not as welcome in the U.S. There is this feeling on top of the actual financial and logical reasoning that they may decide to sell or not buy immediately,\u201d Ad\u017eem said. \u201cIt\u2019s also more difficult to get visas, and the cost of carrying properties in the U.S.\u00a0 has increased significantly.\u201d\nA high net worth client from Canada is in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d because of the Canadian dollar weakening, said Corcoran Group agent Mick Duchon. The Canadian dollar was worth 71 cents in U.S. currency on Monday afternoon.\n\u201c[Canadians] love being here. They love America, they are still interested in being here,\u201d Duchon said. \u201cThings very quickly got much higher priced for them. It\u2019s more of an economic concern.\u201d\nForeign flow\nAs Canadians pull back in South Florida, brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nthey\u2019re still seeing demand from other countries, like Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and buyers from European countries. Miami is still the top city with the most international views among top U.S. metros with 8.4 percent market share, according to the Realtor.com report. New York and Los Angeles followed.\nAs they have for years, condo developers in Miami\nare closely following relations\nbetween the U.S., Mexico and countries in Latin America. Michael Sadov, sales director at Okan Group\u2019s\nOkan Tower\n, which is under construction in downtown Miami, said about half of the project\u2019s buyers so far are foreign.\nColombian buyers make up a quarter of those deals. Mexican buyers are second in line. Sadov said he wrote a contract last weekend for a Venezuelan buyer \u2014 someone living in the U.S. with a business in Venezuela. Brazilian interest has also increased.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s positive relationships with foreign leaders are not translating to real estate purchases in Miami. The Trump administration\u2019s backing of Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei and his party\u2019s victory in the recent midterm elections are encouraging Argentinians in Miami to take their money back to their home country, Sadov said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great the U.S. is making these alliances, but it\u2019s not translating to any kind of shift [to Miami],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually having an adverse effect for our real estate market.\u201d\nContinued demand from buyers in the Northeast, California and the Midwest has\nhelped offset\nfluctuations in the foreign buyer pool, brokers said.\nDuchon said the buyer pool for high-end waterfront homes is still primarily American, and he is part of the majority who believe that will intensify if New York Rep. Zohran Mamdani\nwins the mayoral race\non Tuesday, which is expected.\n\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating a wave of new buyers to come into the market,\u201d Duchon said.\n",

The Weingart board appointed chief operating officer Tonja Boykin to lead the firm in the interim.\nThe inquiry comes after the outlet reported that Weingart\npaid $27.3 million for a Cheviot Hills nursing home last year\njust months after real estate executive Steven Taylor allegedly bought it for $11.2 million using falsified financial records.\nFederal authorities charged Taylor\nlast month with nine felonies in connection to the deal.\nInvestigators are looking into what Weingart and the city knew about the purchase, as the nonprofit had received $47 million in public funds, including $26.6 million from California\u2019s\nHomekey program\n, to convert the nursing home into supportive housing.\nAnother similar project is under the microscope.\nWeingart planned to buy a 122-room Extended Stay America in Torrance for $30 million with the help of state and local funds designated for housing homeless people and convert the property into supportive housing.\nBut the $30 million appraisal was believed to be way off, with experts pinning the value between $21.5 million and $22.7 million. An appraisal commissioned by Torrance officials determined the hotel\u2019s value was $10.2 million.\nFor that project, Weingart had sought $37.7 million in state Homekey+ funds, which helps pay for efforts to quickly house homeless people by converting hotels and motels into housing. Weingart ultimately decided not to move forward with the project following community pushback.\nThe company operates and develops housing sites across Los Angeles County and serves nearly 2,000 people daily.\nSam Josephs, an attorney representing Rosen, said his client welcomes the review.\n\u201cMr. Rosen is a career-long advocate of housing for people experiencing homelessness and is excited about, and welcomes, the opportunity to participate in Weingart\u2019s review to create the most robust internal controls to fulfill the mission of the Weingart Center, where he\u2019s served for more than seven years,\u201d Josephs said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $85.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 76 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 19 contracts totaling $126.4 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 64 new listings, and a total of 1,127 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 10 were single-family homes and four were condos. For condos, the average asking price was $4.6 million, or $1,827 per square foot. They spent an average of 80 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes was $6.7 million. They spent an average of 71 days on the market.\nThe most expensive home to find a buyer last week was the 8,400-square-foot spec mansion at 17113 Northway Circle in Boca Raton, asking $13.2 million. Records show the seller is spec developer David Reich, who bought the 0.3-acre property for $2.6 million in July. The five-bedroom, six-bathroom, two-half bathroom mansion is set to be finished early next year, according to the listing.\nIt hit the market for $13.2 million on Oct. 29 and went pending one day later, Zillow shows.

        "content": "The holiday slowdown has hit Los Angeles\u2019 residential market.\nMega deals have quieted down and signed contract volume overall has slowed countywide, with the latest roundup showing the slump continuing through last week, according to a report compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund Gomes\nteam.\n\u201cWe think this will likely be the trend as we move through the holiday season,\u201d Roth said of the downshift.\nTotal asking volume last week of homes that fell into contract was $121.1 million, off 14.2 percent from the year-ago period, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n. Meanwhile, the number of signed contracts held steady year-over-year at 17.\nThe\nEklund Gomes report\ncounts properties listed at $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nLast week\u2019s signed contracts were not the usual mega deals typical of Los Angeles\u2019 luxury market.\nA Malibu home at 28036 Sea Lane Drive was last week\u2019s top home to go into contract based on listing price. The sellers are asking just under $11 million, or $2,640 per square foot.\nProperty records show the sellers are two trusts. One is tied to Leighton R. Taylor and the other is linked to Taylor\u2019s son, Rob Taylor, and his wife Claudia Taylor. Rob and Claudia Taylor run Sea Lane Studios, a project management and design firm in Malibu.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Sadie Pollock Barish and the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Trevor Wright hold the listing.\nThe over 4,000-square-foot Sea Lane Drive property sits in the ultra-exclusive neighborhood known as Billionaire\u2019s Bluff. It has its own private beach access, gardens, a saltwater pool and outdoor kitchen.\nThe gated property consists of a main house, guest house and separate studio structure.\nLos Angeles County\u2019s next largest home to go into contract, based on asking price, was in the nearby Pacific Palisades.\nThe property, located at 14148 Rustic Lane, is asking $10.4 million, or $2,371 per square foot.\nCompass\u2019 Diana Braun and Frank Langen are listing the property.\nProperty records show the sellers are a trust tied to Charles Corwin, film producer and CEO of content studio SK Global, and Olivia Corwin. The trust paid $9.3 million for the home in 2020.\nKnown as the Newman Residence, the property was designed in 1948 by Lloyd Wright and is the former home of Alfred Newman, an award-winning film composer.\nThe five-bed, four-bath home is 4,386 square feet sitting on nearly 1.5 acres. The property consists of a main house, in addition to two pavilions that could be used as bedrooms among other uses.\n",

        "content": "Stratford Drive in\nAustin\nhad the top luxury deals in the city at the end of October.\nThe two most expensive homes sold last week are both off Stratford, in Westlake Hills\u2019 Bluffington section, according to the Eklund Gomes team.\nTheir sales show differing aspects of the Austin luxury market. The first, offering a potential teardown on a unique lot, sold in less than three weeks with no change to the asking price. The second, a bigger, newer build on a smaller lot, spent over 130 days on market and took a $775,000 price cut before selling.\nThe top deal was a three-bedroom, three-bathroom asking $6.5 million, or about $2,500 per square foot. The home at 2702 Valley Springs Road, a small drive that branches off Stratford, was built in 1964.\nPerched on a bluff, the 2,500-square-foot home commands an unobstructed view of the Austin skyline across the water. The 1.6-acre lot includes 303 feet of waterfront access, as well as a natural cave formation.\nKirk Lewis of Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty marketed the home as a \u201cremodel opportunity.\u201d\nThe property had been in the same family since it was built, according to county records. Bassett Maguire inherited the home from Marjorie Maguire in 2010 and sold it to Rachel Maguire this January. Maguire\u2019s buyer hasn\u2019t been identified yet.\nIt went under contract in just 16 days, lightning fast, especially for this market. Austin luxury homes sell after an average of 90 days on market, making it one of the slowest luxury markets in the country, according to\nRedfin\n.\nThe second most-expensive home sold last week was just half a mile away, at 2505 Stratford Drive. The 5,000-square-foot home last asked $4.25 million, or about $800 per square foot.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home was listed for $5 million in June; the seller dropped the price on Oct. 12, according to Zillow.\nBuilt on half an acre in 2009, the contemporary glass-and-concrete home also boasts a view of downtown. Dave van Heuven, owner and broker of\nvan Heuven Properties\n, shared the listing with Deacon Shields of RA Residential.\nFinal sales prices aren\u2019t available for either deal.\n",

The transfer took place when Feil didn\u2019t pay off the $180 million loan when it came due in September, according to a report from credit-rating agency KBRA.\nThe loan originated 10 years ago. The property generates enough cash to service its debts, Fitch Ratings reported in July, meaning there could be an opportunity to refinance at a higher rate.\nTo that end, a spokesperson for the developer claimed the firm was \u201cnegotiating an extension.\u201d KBRA, meanwhile, claimed a workout strategy by the special servicer had not yet been revealed publicly.\nThe 26-story, 450,000-square-foot building off of East 29th Street is 82 percent leased, according to CoStar. Tenants include textile designer Himatsingka and DKC Public Relations, and asking rents go up to $71 per square foot.\nFeil has been\nfaced with distress\nacross its 26-million-square-foot portfolio.\nPrivate equity giant KKR\u2019s securitized loan servicer, K-Star Asset Management, filed a foreclosure lawsuit in August alleging the landlord defaulted on debt tied to a four-story, 35,000-square-foot loft office building in the West Loop area in Chicago. The lender said Feil owed more than $8.2 million on the loan.\nIn Chicago, Feil already surrendered a similar loft office building in the River North district and is facing a lawsuit brought by special servicer\nRialto Capital for an alleged default on a $105 million CMBS loan\ntied to another office building and seeking either forbearance or another loan modification for a\n$75 million debt tied to the North Riverside Park Mall\nin suburban Chicago.\nBack in New York, Feil and its joint venture partners \u2014 BLDG and the Nakash Family \u2014\nstarted construction\non the conversion of a 14-story, 85,000-square-foot office building at 140 West 57th Street into 47 luxury condos; Deutsche Bank provided a $65 million construction loan for the project.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After repeatedly refusing to reveal his position on the proposals, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani said on Tuesday that he voted in favor of the controversial housing ballot measures.\nMamdani, before voting on Tuesday morning, confirmed that he planned to vote yes on the four housing ballot measures. City Council leaders and some of the city\u2019s most powerful labor unions oppose three of\nthose measures\n, which create faster approval processes for certain housing projects that bypass City Council review and an appeals board that could reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of projects.\nLater in the morning, he told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer that the urgent need for more housing in the city guided his decision. He also, however, said he understood City Council\u2019s opposition to the measures, noting that they were guided by dedication to their communities. City Council leadership has said that the ballot measures would rob members of their ability to demand investments in their communities as a condition of rezonings.\nDuring the\nfinal mayoral debate\n, Mamdani said he had not yet taken a position on the measures, a refrain he repeated in the lead-up to the election.\nWhen asked Tuesday if he held off on announcing how he would vote to avoid alienating voters, Mamdani told Lehrer the timing reflected his desire to be \u201cintentional\u201d in deciding how to vote. He said he wanted to speak to various stakeholders and only announced his position once he made up his mind.\nStill, by holding off on voicing his support, Mamdani delayed drawing the ire of two unions that endorsed him, as well as City Council members he will need to work with if elected mayor.\nTwo unions that endorsed Mamdani, 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, opposed the ballot measures, fearing that they would remove the City Council\u2019s ability to ensure union labor is hired on housing projects. A representative for HTC declined to comment, and a representative for 32BJ did not return a message seeking comment.\nThe City Council sent out ads warning voters that because of the ballot measures, their \u201cneighborhood essentials are at stake.\u201d\nWhile Democratic leaders in the Council presented a united front against the measures in the lead-up to the election, some City Council members have posted on social media that they support the changes.\n\u201cBallot proposals 2-5 are good,\u201d Manhattan Council member Shaun Abreu posted on his Instagram story Tuesday morning, referring to the housing ballot questions. \u201cThey hold more of your representatives accountable and make our growing city less hostile to the concept of more housing. That\u2019s why I voted yes.\u201d\nManhattan Council member Erik Bottcher posted on Instagram that he voted in favor of the measures. Brooklyn Council member Shahana Hanif\nreposted\nabout Mamdani voting yes on the measures, adding a saluting emoji.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, supports the measures. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa opposes the changes and told Lehrer on Tuesday that in supporting the measures, the other candidates are \u201chelping developers and realtors.\u201d\nAmit Singh Bagga, who leads Yes on Affordable Housing, a campaign that has spent more than\n$1 million\nto promote the measures, also voiced support for Mamadani Tuesday morning, saying that a vote for both Mamdani and the ballot measures will \u201cchange the course of our city\u2019s future.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Four years after scoring approval for a 354-unit luxury apartment tower in North Miami Beach, developer Celal Ozkan lost the site to the lender in bankruptcy court.\nAn affiliate of\nCEO Contract\n, led by Ozkan, will turn over the nearly 1-acre site at 16300 Northeast 19th Avenue to Miami Beach-based Safe Harbor Equity, which had provided an $8.5 million loan for the site in 2022, according to court records. CEO Contract has offices in Istanbul and New Castle, Delaware.\nFederal\nbankruptcy\ncourt Judge Laurel M. Isicoff in Miami approved the sale last week to Safe Harbor\u2019s distressed debt fund 3.\nA source familiar with the matter said the bankruptcy auction scheduled for Sept. 26 was canceled, likely due to a lack of qualified bidders. Bidders were supposed to offer at least $4.55 million for the site, according to court filings.\nThis marks the end of a yearslong, bitter feud between CEO Contract and\nSafe Harbor\n.\n\u201cThis is a fantastic property that we are excited to work with a developer to sell this asset,\u201d Chris Spuches, Safe Harbor\u2019s attorney, said, adding the firm won\u2019t be developing the property.\nAttorneys and representatives for CEO Contract didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nCEO Contract, through its affiliate, Sky Gardens Residences, bought the vacant property in 2022 for $5.2 million. It scored\nfinal approval\nfor the 20-story apartment tower, to be called Sky Gardens Residences, with a rooftop garden and amenities in 2021, according to records. Construction never started.\nPlans took a turn beginning in 2022, when CEO Contract borrowed an $8.5 million loan with an 8.75 percent interest rate from Safe Harbor, with a one-year term and two six-month extension options, court records show. CEO Contract, its affiliates, Ozkan and Cagatay Emre Ozkan, COO of CEO Contract, were debt guarantors. Enforcement of their personal guarantees was only triggered in cases of fraud, misappropriation or diversion of the property, or other similar issues, according to CEO Contract\u2019s court filings.\nSafe Harbor alleged CEO Contract defaulted by failing to pay the August 2022 and January 2023 debt obligations by the due dates, according to court records. It also alleged that CEO Contract didn\u2019t timely pay the full taxes for 2022. Under a forbearance agreement in 2023, the pair worked out a deal for CEO Contract to pay down the principal to $7.7 million and extend the loan term.\nCEO Contract\u2019s Sky Gardens affiliate first sued Safe Harbor last year in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accusing it of usury and manufacturing the default claims, according to court filings. It also disputed the amount it owes in property taxes and alleged that Safe Harbor pressured CEO Contract into the forbearance agreement and imposed a 2 percent extension fee on the original loan amount of $8.5 million, not on the lower balance of $7.7 million.\nAt one point, Safe Harbor allegedly tried to impose a retroactive default interest rate, which coupled with other fees amounted to more than the 25 percent maximum annual rate allowed in Florida, CEO Contract alleged in court filings.\nIn the lawsuit, CEO Contract called Safe Harbor a \u201cgreedy lender\u201d running a \u201cvicious campaign\u201d to take over the North Miami Beach site through a \u201c\u2018loan-to-own\u2019 scheme\u201d and \u201cimpairing\u201d the developer\u2019s ability to refinance.\nSafe Harbor responded with a countersuit for foreclosure, bringing up the default allegations and also alleging CEO Contract defaulted on the principal payment last year.\nIn January, CEO Contract filed for\nChapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization\n, which paused the dueling Miami-Dade Circuit Court lawsuits. An order for foreclosure was never issued in that case.\nThe property is appraised at $18 million, and the proposed project at buildout and lease-up is valued at $161 million, court filings say.\nThe property will be transferred free and clear from liens, except for a Miami-Dade tax lien for $114,000 for 2024 and 2025 property taxes, filings show.\n",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence startup Sierra, co-founded by\nOpenAI\nchairman and former\nSalesforce\nco-CEO Bret Taylor, is nearing one of the largest office leases of the year in San Francisco.\nThe enterprise-focused AI company has inked a deal for 300,000 square feet of offices at 185 Berry Street in China Basin, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The building is owned by McCarthy Cook and Company and JPMorgan Chase.\nSierra was founded in 2023 by Taylor and former Google Labs head Clay Bavor; it was recently valued at $10 billion. The firm currently leases about 80,000 square feet at 235 Second Street in South of Market.\nLike other AI companies in the Bay Area and beyond, Sierra is in the midst of a growth spurt. The company currently has hundreds of employees and has plans to triple its head count down the line.\nThe China Basin complex at 185 Berry Street consists of two buildings on the edge of Mission Bay. Rideshare leader Lyft has its headquarters at China Basin, renewing its lease there last year while shaving down its footprint by more than half.\nIf Sierra closes its pending lease deal at the complex, it would be one of the biggest tech tenants in the city, ranking alongside AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic with office leases spanning six figures of square footage. Sierra\u2019s deal would be the biggest new lease in the city since OpenAI\u2019s 315,000-square-foot\nexpansion in Mission Bay\nlast year. At the top of this year, Google renewed its lease for 405,000 square feet at 345 Spear Street.\nLast month, Anthropic agreed to\nexpand its headquarters\nwith an additional 100,000 square feet at 505 Howard Street. OpenAI, meanwhile, is now\nturning its focus to Silicon Valley\nafter growing its headquarters operations in San Francisco; the Sam Altman-led firm is reportedly in the market for up to 500,000 square feet in the region, purportedly touring offices in Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 7,000-square-foot home sold for almost $643 per square foot.\nThey paid $3.65 million in 2012 \u2014 or $521 per square foot for the home. They listed it this spring after buying a 10-bedroom, 11,000-square-foot estate in unincorporated\nWinnetka\nonce owned by the late Chicago businessman\nAndrew McKenna\n.\nThe Cruzes paid $5.7 million, or $513 per square foot, for the McKenna property in June 2023. Their ownership via a land trust hadn\u2019t been previously reported.\nThe brick-and-limestone Lincoln Park house, built in 2010 on a 33-foot-wide lot and located at 2015 North Dayton Street, features seven bathrooms, multiple fireplaces, a four-stop elevator and designer finishes throughout.\nAmenities include a media room, wine cellar, gym and heated three-car garage. Outdoor spaces boast a bluestone patio with a fireplace and a 500-square-foot deck over the garage, with a pergola, pizza oven and retractable TV.\nThe Cruzes put the home on the market for $5 million before trimming the price to $4.85 million in May and finding a buyer three months later. The purchaser was an opaque land trust whose beneficiary hasn\u2019t been identified. Ryan Preuett of Sotheby\u2019s International represented the sellers, and Danny Leung of Baird &amp; Wartner represented the buyers.\nCruz co-founded GoHealth in 2001 to build software for insurance brokers. The company has evolved into a major Medicare-focused digital health marketplace. The federal government recently accused GoHealth and other brokers of receiving illegal kickbacks from insurers for enrolling seniors in their Medicare Advantage plans, allegations GoHealth has denied. Cruz, who led the firm as president until 2020, now serves as co-chairman of its board.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company completed its bulk purchase of a waterfront condo building in North Miami where the firm plans a luxury condo tower.\nThe New York and North Bay Village-based development firm, led by Ian Bruce Eichner, paid $48.5 million for the four-story, 46-unit condo building at 12000 North Bayshore Drive, a spokesperson said. The developer previously secured approval to build a\n22-story, 267-unit condo building\n.\nContinuum plans to reveal project details and launch sales early next year, according to a press release.\nEichner, chairman and CEO of Continuum, said in a statement that the firm \u201cworked closely with the owners at Mariners Bay to consolidate the property through the condominium termination process.\u201d A termination of the association is a required legal step so a developer can eventually knock down the former condo building.\nIn October, CW Investment Advisers\nsued Continuum\nover the financing backing the buyout of Mariners Bay. CW alleges it\u2019s owed more than half a million dollars in fees tied to the sale, which was expected to close earlier this year.\nThe developer began negotiating with unit owners about three years ago and secured a rezoning of the property to allow for a 217-foot residential tower earlier this year. The association was facing \u201cmounting long-term deferred maintenance obligations and substantial special assessments,\u201d according to the release, which totaled $6.5 million in repairs, the South Florida Business Journal previously\nreported\n.\nAbout 1.5 acres of the property are submerged land in Biscayne Bay. The new project will have about 150,000 square feet of amenities, including a marina, water sports, golf and a health, wellness and social club. Kobi Karp Architecture and Interior Design is the project architect, Paul Duesing Partners will handle the interior design, and Martha Schwartz Partners is designing the landscaping.\nContinuum has a $3 billion, 1,000-unit condo portfolio in South Florida that includes planned projects in North Bay Village and Bay Harbor Islands.\nIn August, Continuum secured a\n$67 million construction loan\nfor the second phase of its Bay Harbor Islands condo project. The developer received the financing for La Baia North from S3 Capital Partners, a New York-based alternative lender that provides middle-market construction loans and bridge loans.\nThis summer, the development firm secured unanimous\napproval\nfrom the North Bay Village Commission for a special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the Continuum Waterfront District. The district is planned to have two Continuum condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall. The site includes the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill, now called the Palm Tree Club.\n",

        "content": "A 211-acre master-planned community that could bring a surf park and $1.5 billion in development to Mustang Ridge, about 15 miles southeast of downtown Austin, is moving forward.\nThe Mustang Ridge City Council approved a development agreement with an affiliate of Austin-based SonWest Company last week, allowing the firm to advance infrastructure work on its long-gestating Pura Vida project, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe vote came after years of negotiations over water rights, state approvals and local entitlements in the small but fast-growing city of about 1,000 residents.\nSonWest partners Andy Bilger and Shawn Breedlove said construction could begin by late next year if market conditions hold. Early plans call for a multifamily, retail, restaurants, a hotel and civic space, plus a potential surf park that could span up to 30 acres.\nThe developers said they\u2019ve held talks with several surf park operators, including Surf Lakes Holdings, but have not finalized an agreement.\nSonWest, best known for building the 5,000-acre Sonterra community in Jarrell, has spent the past four years assembling land and negotiating infrastructure terms for the Mustang Ridge site, which sits off U.S. Highway 183 and FM 1327.\nThe property is across from a 1.2 million-square-foot industrial project under construction by Houston-based Clay Development &amp; Construction, including a building leased to a Tesla supplier.\nSonWest is footing the bill for tens of millions of dollars in new utilities for the project. The developer is coordinating with the Creedmoor Maha Water Supply District on a 30,000-foot water line and a new wastewater treatment facility capable of handling 3.3 million gallons per day.\nMustang Ridge\u2019s lack of infrastructure has long deterred large-scale projects, but city officials say Pura Vida could change that. Mayor David Bunn said the city expects \u201csignificant ancillary business\u201d from the development.\nThe agreement authorizes the city to consider financial incentives such as property tax abatements and sales and hotel tax rebates. Developers said they\u2019re already in talks with prospective multifamily and retail partners and are marketing sites to major anchors.\nWater use remains a point of contention. With Central Texas facing persistent drought, some residents have questioned the optics of building a surf park in the region.\nBilger countered that Pura Vida\u2019s system would rely on recycled and reclaimed water, not drinking water, and would use \u201cvery low volumes\u201d through a partnership with Austin-based VVater.\nThe Mustang Ridge project would add to the growing interest in lagoon- and surf-themed developments across Texas, including\niLand Development\u2019s\nproposed $1 billion Leander Springs project in the northwest Austin suburb of Leander; a $400 million lagoon project with a monorail iLand proposed in Marble Falls; and Discovery Land Company and Kelly Slater are already underway redeveloping a wavegarden lagoon near Austin in\nDel Valle\ninto a surf-and-condo community.\nSports Hospitality Ventures canceled plans recently for a Sports Illustrated Resort at the\nLago Mar Crystal Lagoon\nin Texas City outside of Houston. That project was announced in January 2024 and was to include a 200-room hotel, restaurant and beach club.\nAnother Houston-area lagoon-centered residential project launched in 2022, Dallas-based developer Megatel\u2019s $2 billion\nSaint Tropez\nnear Lake Houston, has completed its first phase.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Steven Roth opened Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Election Day third-quarter earnings call with politics.\n\u201cThe election in New York City with the prospect of a Democrat socialist mayor has attracted enormous attention,\u201d Roth said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist and believe that everything will work out for the best. Importantly, with respect to the prospect of a Mamdani mayoralty, we have not seen any pullback or hesitancy in space demand from our customers. In fact, the opposite.\u201d\nThe Vornado chairman and CEO stayed upbeat as he turned to the topic of real estate. Manhattan\u2019s office market has entered what he called \u201cthe third inning\u201d of a new growth cycle, with availability at Class A \u201cbetter buildings\u201d tightening rapidly. Roth said the market has flipped from favoring tenants to landlords.\nRevenue for the third quarter was $453.7 million, a 2.4 percent year-over-year increase. Net income for the first three quarters was $842 million, up from $7.1 million, due largely to the $1.6 billion master lease with NYU at 770 Broadway, which resulted in an $803 million gain.\n\u201cOur business is good \u2014 really good \u2014 and growing stronger,\u201d Roth said.\nVornado leased 3.7 million square feet through the first nine months of 2025, including 2.8 million in Manhattan. The REIT expects Manhattan office leasing volume to notch its highest year in over a decade and its second-highest year on record, Roth said. Excluding NYU\u2019s master lease at 770 Broadway, new Manhattan deals averaged $99 per square foot.\n\u201cTenant demand is robust,\u201d Roth said. \u201cCompanies are expanding, demand is broad-based across all industries and available space in the better buildings continues to evaporate quickly.\u201d\nThe firm\u2019s crown jewel \u2014 the Penn District \u2014 continues to outperform. Penn 2 is 78 percent leased and expected to surpass 80 percent by year-end. At Penn 1, Vornado has leased 1.6 million square feet since the start of its redevelopment in 2021, with average starting rents of $94, Roth said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the tipping point for the Penn District \u2014 our three-block-long city-within-a-city, is now behind us,\u201d Roth said.\nThe firm is in the planning stages for a 475-unit residential building at the northeast corner of\nWest 34th Street and Eighth Avenue\nwith construction slated to begin next year. It\u2019s also moving ahead with an overhaul of the \u201cjunky retail\u201d on both sides of Seventh Avenue and 34th Street into \u201cattractive, modern and exciting retail offerings,\u201d Roth said.\nRoth also said that Vornado is speaking with potential tenants for \u201csubstantial blocks of space\u201d at the old Hotel Pennsylvania site, known as Penn 15, which is expected to be office with some residential space. He didn\u2019t, however, reveal how far along those talks are or who might be interested.\nMeanwhile, Vornado is doubling down on Midtown with its acquisition of\n623 Fifth Avenue\n, a mostly vacant tower above the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store that Roth called a \u201cblank slate\u201d for redevelopment into a \u201cvery best, elite\u201d boutique office building by the end of 2027. And its 1.8 million-square-foot\n350 Park Avenue\ntower with Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel remains on schedule to begin demolition next year, with tenant interest reportedly already emerging.\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing in New York \u2014 and we\u2019re growing smartly,\u201d Roth said.\n",

        "content": "13th Floor and Key International are launching a Nobu-branded condo tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell, the brand\u2019s first residential project in the city.\nThe announcement follows a controversial fight over the development site, which is on the longtime grounds of the historic First Miami Presbyterian Church at 609 Brickell Avenue.\nBrickell residents opposing the development\nlost their fight\nin April, allowing the developers to move forward with the project. The tower is planned for 2.2 acres currently occupied by the church\u2019s school and parking lot. The church will remain intact and is expected to sell the site to the developers for\nabout $240 million\n.\n13th Floor\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, and Key International, led by the Ardid family, are both based in Miami. They tapped Foster + Partners and Sieger Suarez Architects to design the waterfront tower, dubbed 619 Brickell. It will span 74 stories with 300 units, according to the press release. The building will have 90,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, fitness center, spa facilities and a cafe. It will have a Nobu restaurant on the ground floor, making it the Miami area\u2019s second Nobu, after one in Miami Beach, the release shows.\nThe site is adjacent to the office tower at 701 Brickell Avenue, which Elliott Management bought for a near-record\n$443 million\nlast year.\nNobu Hospitality was founded by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa, actor and hotelier Robert De Niro, and producer Meir Teper. It is led by CEO Trevor Horwell and COO Struan McKenzie.\nThe firm has branded condos in Cabo, Mexico, and Toronto, Canada. It also has planned condos in Orlando; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; Tulum, Mexico; Montenegro; Barbuda; Krak\u00f3w, Poland; Manchester, England; Amsterdam; Baku, Azerbaijan; Kuwait, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia; Abu Dhabi and Al Marjan Island, United Arab Emirates; Cairo; Bangkok; and Da Nang, Viet Nam, according to its website.\nKarsenti and the Ardids both have other projects planned in Brickell. Earlier this month, Karsenti partnered with Dubai-based Kerzner International on\nSiro Brickell\n, a planned condo-hotel with 180 keys and 350 branded condos. Last year, the Ardids partnered with Chicago-based Sterling Bay on\na 51-story Brickell office tower\nat 848 Brickell Avenue.",

        "content": "More than three years after filing building permits, the Irgang Group is ready to get going on a multifamily project in Harlem.\nDwight Mortgage Trust originated a $70 million construction loan for the development at 33-35 West 125th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The proceeds of the financing will go towards construction costs and the establishment of an interest reserve.\nA Meridian Capital Group led by Simon Rosenfeld and Ariel Taieb arranged the financing for the joint venture, which includes Pramukh Realty.\nBack in the spring of 2022, Irgang\nfiled plans\nwith the Department of Buildings to build an approximately 144,000-square-foot property. The 195-foot-tall building would feature 21 stories with 162 residential units.\nThe project has since expanded to 180 units, ranging from studios to two-bedroom apartments. The development will also include 17,000 square feet of commercial space and residential amenities such as a fitness center, a rooftop terrace and a library.\nCritically, the development is eligible for a 35-year tax abatement under the lapsed 421a program, according to Dwight Mortgage, because 30 percent of the units will be designated as affordable housing. The completion deadline to qualify for the tax abatement was pushed back to 2031 in last year\u2019s state budget.\nConstruction is expected to begin next year, according to Meridian; Irgang has owned the development site since 1991.\nA few months ago, Dwight Mortgage\nprovided a $155 million bridge loan\nto the Beitel Group to refinance a 405-unit rental complex at 261 and 315 Grand Concourse in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. The refinancing provided a \u201csignificant cash-out\u201d to the developer, according to the Dwight Capital real estate investment trust affiliate.\nElsewhere in Harlem, Slate Property Group and Evenhar Development are\npursuing\na medical office and community facility property at 1578 Lexington Avenue, blocks from Mount Sinai\u2019s main campus. They are eyeing a 13-story, 175,000-square-foot building with 150,000 square feet of medical office space and 19,000 square feet for the East Harlem Center.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Raoul Thomas\u2019 financially floundering CGI Merchant Group sold its Nexus co-working portfolio for $31 million.\nOver the past two years, Miami-based CGI Merchant has faced\ndebt woes\non its properties and parted with most of its portfolio through either foreclosures or sales. Its troubles came amid elevated interest rates that have increased payments for floating-rate loans and made it difficult to refinance, plus skyrocketing insurance.\nIn the most recent deal, CGI Merchant sold five office properties, three of which had a loan in special servicing due to delinquent debt payments, Morningstar Credit data shows.\nTMT Properties, a Coral Springs-based commercial real estate investment firm, bought the Nexus properties in Palm Beach and Martin counties from CGI Merchant, according to TMT Properties COO Joseph Maas. TMT Properties, led by Paul and Susan Burrell, has a licensing agreement to continue operating the buildings under the Nexus name.\nGreg Miller and Miguel Alcivar of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and Christian Arrabal of Advisecre represented CGI Merchant in the sale.\nCGI Merchant representatives, including Thomas, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTMT Properties plans about $6 million in \u201cextensive\u201d capital improvements, including roofs, landscaping and air conditioning, over the next year to year and a half, Maas said. Tenants are renting directly from TMT Properties under short-term leases. Nexus has no lease on the buildings.\n\u201cThese were distressed properties,\u201d Mass said. \u201cWe know we can get them back up to a standard and continue operating them the way they should be operated by adding amenities, a fresher look.\u201d\nThe portfolio consists of the pair of two-story buildings at 8401 and 8461 Lake Worth Road near Wellington, completed in 2006 and 2007 on a 12-acre site; the one-story building at 2101 Vista Parkway near West Palm Beach, completed in 1989 on a 5-acre site; the two-story building at 20283 South State Road 7 near Boca Raton, completed in 1999 on a 2.5-acre site;\u00a0 and the two-story building at 1375 Gateway Boulevard in Boynton Beach, completed in 1991 on a 2.3-acre site, according to property records and TMT Properties. The only property in Martin County is the two-story building at 850 Northwest Federal Highway in Stuart, completed in 2004 on a 4-acre site.\nTMT Properties is a development and investment firm that also provides brokerage, property management and tenant build-out services, according to its website.\nIn past investments, TMT Properties paid\n$10.1 million\nfor a pair of Delray Beach office buildings at 190 and 200 Congress Park Drive in 2019. The deal was part of a 1031 exchange. In 2018, the firm paid\n$18.5 million\nfor the Shoppes At Loggers Run at 11411 West Palmetto Park Road near Boca Raton.\nIn January, CGI Merchant\u2019s loan on the buildings near Wellington and West Palm, and on the Stuart building entered special servicing due to\ndelinquent payments\n, Morningstar Credit shows. CGI Merchant\u2019s affiliates took out a $15.7 million refinancing on the properties in 2018 from Starwood Mortgage Capital, an affiliate of billionaire\nBarry Sternlicht\u2019s\nMiami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group. The loan has a balance of nearly $14 million, according to Morningstar Credit.\nRecords show this isn\u2019t the only financial trouble for the portfolio, with liens from the state and contractors, alleging unpaid bills.\nOn the buildings near Wellington, the Florida Department of Revenue filed four tax liens this year, most recently last month for $25,400, according to records. Separately, the Law Offices of James G. Gravera, a former tenant at the property, sued CGI Merchant\u2019s affiliate last year, alleging it didn\u2019t return the law firm\u2019s deposit for its lease after it left the building, according to the complaint. In January, a Palm Beach Circuit Court judge issued a default final judgment against CGI Merchant\u2019s entity for $8,596, including for the principal, attorney fees and 18 percent interest. Also, Highlight Reel Landscaping filed a lien for $8,100 for allegedly unpaid services at the property.\nAt the property near West Palm Beach, the Florida Department of Revenue filed three tax liens this year, including for $24,550 and $16,700 last month, records show. Highlight Reel Landscaping also filed a lien alleging $6,900 for unpaid work. In August, a Palm Beach Circuit Court judge awarded ProWaste USA a final judgment for nearly $4,600, or the amount CGI Merchant owed to ProWaste after the two reached a settlement on allegedly unpaid bills for waste services, according to records.\nThe Nexus properties near Boca Raton and in Boynton Beach also have state tax liens, records show.\nThe portfolio previously was slated to be sold to Santa Monica, California-based GBT Technologies, according to news releases and media reports. It\u2019s unclear why that deal was foiled. GBT didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nCGI Merchant\u2019s financial woes started early last year, when the firm defaulted on a\n$285 million\nloan on the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC, which the firm had bought from the Trump Organization for\n$375 million\nin 2022. Thomas, who got a 45-day postponement on the auction, tried to recapitalize, but lender BDT &amp; MSD Partners foreclosed last summer and took the property.\nCGI Merchant lost its 129-key Gabriel Downtown Miami hotel at the luxury Marquis condo tower at 1100 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami last year in a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction. Lender Madison Realty Capital, which filed the UCC foreclosure over a\n$60.4 million\nloan, took over the property.\nIn July, Park Central Lender filed a foreclosure suit against CGI Merchant, alleging it defaulted on a\n$69 million\nloan on the 140-key Gabriel South Beach hotel at 620-650 Ocean Drive in Miami Beach. Park Central bought the loan from Deutsche Bank, which had filed a UCC foreclosure on the debt in 2023, postponing the auction several times.\nCGI Merchant\nlos\nt its five-story headquarters building at 3480 Main Highway in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove in February. Torose Equities, a Coconut Grove-based firm led by Scott Sherman, was the winning bidder in a UCC auction for the property.\nIn May, CGI Merchant staved off foreclosure on 65 commercial condo units at the Ten Aragon Condominium at 55 Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, selling the properties for\n$28.5 million\nto Miami Beach-based Elysee Investments, led by CEO Haim Yehezkel.\nThrough it all, Thomas has continued fighting to stop the bleeding, telling\nThe Real Deal\nin past interviews he is working to recapitalize his properties and secure equity partners.\n",

        "content": "Lincoln Property Company\npurchased a five-story Manhattan Beach office building on the Rosecrans Avenue corridor with multifamily redevelopment plans.\nThe Dallas-based firm paid $70 million, or $569 per square foot for the 123,000-square-foot building.\nThe seller is\nContinental Development Corporation\n; the firm\u2019s president of development, Alex Rose, signed the grant deed dated mid-October. The deal involved $45 million in seller financing, according to a deed of trust signed by Southern California Lincoln Property executive Rob Kane.\nBerkadia\u2019s Brett Betzler brokered the deal and said the offices will be demolished and replaced with apartments. Representatives for the buyer and seller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Continental\u2019s Rose declined to comment.\nThe office property at 1500 Rosecrans Avenue is near Manhattan Village, a shopping mall, and many other retail spots and restaurants. It\u2019s part of a commercial center that spans parts of El Segundo and Manhattan Beach.\nThe Beach Cities office submarket, which encompasses Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, has a 15 percent vacancy rate. That is lower than all of South Bay\u2019s 23.5 percent vacancy rate, according to CBRE \u2014 and far lower than downtown Los Angeles\u2019 33.3 percent, which has the lion\u2019s share of office distress.\nBut the average Manhattan Beach home value is $3 million, according to Zillow, and the average rent is $5,500 a month.\nThe deal is pricey: In South Bay, the most expensive office sale recorded in the third quarter was an $18 million trade in Carson, and the next was less than $10 million in El Segundo, per CBRE. Though those sold for $1,021 and $774 per square foot, respectively.\nFor context, Tishman Speyer\u2019s $205 million sale of the Maple Plaza building in Beverly Hills to Kilroy Realty, one of the year\u2019s biggest office deals, amounted to\n$707 per square foot\n.\nIt\u2019s the latest Lincoln Property office deal in Los Angeles. The firm\nsecured\na $197 million acquisition loan from Blackstone Group last year to finance its purchase of the Bluffs at Playa Vista, an office complex at 12181 Bluff Creek Drive.\nIt paid $187.5 million, or $375 per square foot, for that 500,000-square-foot campus, with no plans for a residential play.\u00a0However, the company\ntweaked\nits plans earlier this year for a mixed-use apartment complex in Culver City, nixing offices for more housing.\n",

        "content": "Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has fallen behind on property taxes for his\nchildhood home\nin Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood, adding to his recent real estate woes.\nHe bought the modest house in 2018 to save it from demolition.\nThe first-half property tax bill of $1,514, due March 4, hasn\u2019t been paid, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing Cook County Treasurer records. The second installment, normally due Aug. 1, hasn\u2019t been mailed due to Cook County\ndelays\n.\nThe unpaid balance at 7815 South South Shore Drive is a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $78 million in luxury real estate Ye once owned, but it hints at broader neglect across his\nfar-flung portfolio\n.\nOver the past two years, the artist\u2019s holdings \u2014 which once stretched from Malibu to Wyoming \u2014 have been plagued by unpaid bills, stalled projects and sharp devaluations.\nIn September, Ye sold his 6,700-acre Bighorn Mountain Ranch in Wyoming for $14 million \u2014 roughly half a million less than he paid in 2019.\nHis smaller Monster Lake Ranch, also in Wyoming, has been on and off the market for years without a reported sale.\nAnd in\nMalibu\n, a minimalist concrete mansion designed by Pritzker Prize\u2013winner\nTadao Ando\n\u2014 which Ye gutted after buying for $57 million in 2021 \u2014 sold last fall for $21 million, a staggering $36 million loss.\nCloser to Los Angeles, several of Ye\u2019s properties are in limbo. A $6.7 million Melrose Avenue commercial building purchased as Yeezy\u2019s future headquarters sits vacant. A Calabasas condo listed for $2.95 million reportedly has more than $60,000 in unpaid property taxes, and he\u2019s also marketing two other local parcels for a combined $3.5 million.\nThe South Shore house carries deep personal history for Ye: his mother, Donda West, bought it in 1981, and he lived there until he was a teenager. After a series of ownership changes and a foreclosure, Ye reacquired the home through an LLC from his longtime collaborator, Che \u201cRhymefest\u201d Smith, who had planned to convert it into an arts incubator called Donda\u2019s House.\nThe property shows signs of partial renovation \u2014 a new roof, siding, windows and a wrought-iron fence with \u201cDonda\u2019s House\u201d initials \u2014 but its current use is unclear. Whether Ye ever intended it as a residence, museum or symbolic gesture, the missed tax payment suggests the South Shore home has become just another loose end in an unraveling real estate empire.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "This week, I heard from an affordable housing developer who is increasingly worried about the federal government shutdown \u2014 food stamps and rental vouchers, in particular.\nNot only has the shutdown gone on longer than is typical, but the Trump administration has taken some seemingly discretionary actions to pressure Democrats to make a deal.\nUsually, the federal government tries to minimize the impact of shutdowns. But Donald Trump is not your usual president. He is always looking for leverage and is not a slave to political norms. As such, he has spoken openly about the shutdown giving him an opportunity to cut Democrats\u2019 favorite programs.\nThat\u2019s a problem for landlords who rely on Section 8 or whose tenants receive SNAP benefits, aka food stamps. I asked this developer about the expression, \u201cthe rent eats first.\u201d\nThe developer replied: \u201cPeople will definitely pay for food first before they pay rent. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nYes. Hunger is immediate; rent is not. And I have learned \u2014 as many tenants did during the Covid moratoriums \u2014 that not paying rent doesn\u2019t mean you will be evicted anytime soon, if ever. Even without a lawyer, you can\nsquat for two years\nwithout paying.\nNot only that, but rent arrears are necessary to get a one-shot deal from the city, just as they were to get help from the state\u2019s Covid-era Emergency Rental Assistance Program.\nThat seems like an incentive not to pay, but other social programs work the same way. I recently helped a couple who\u2019d lost everything (except their house) pay the electric and gas bill \u2014 PSEG was threatening to cut off their service. But when I inquired about the utility\u2019s hardship program, I was told only customers in arrears are eligible.\nThe couple then applied for welfare but were rejected by New Jersey \u2014 because I had paid their bills. The lesson is clear: To get help from the safety net, you must be a deadbeat.\nBut I digress. Back to the developer, who had just read a Department of Housing and Urban Development press release in which HUD Secretary Scott Turner\nsaid\n, \u201cFor nearly one month, the Left has held our government hostage. Rather than ending this shutdown and putting our government back to work for the American people, they continue to shamelessly exploit Americans\u2019 pain for political gain.\u201d\nOnce upon a time \u2014 meaning 10 months ago \u2014 such a statement from an agency head would have been unthinkable.\nThe developer was disturbed.\n\u201cIf HUD stops paying, first repairs and maintenance will drastically suffer, then violations will pile up, then you will trip your debt covenants either by A) not maintaining the property or B) not servicing your loan. Or A and B.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNissequogue River State Park is\nmarred by dozens of abandoned buildings\nfrom the old Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which closed 30 years ago. The 521-acre site was deemed parkland five years later, but the buildings remain because the state has higher priorities than to demolish them and execute\na plan\ncalling for playgrounds, concession stands, a farmers market, botanical garden and a museum. Should the state consider a public-private partnership instead? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Insurance companies now pay more for\nsidewalk liability claims\nthan for fire- and water-related damages \u2014 the traditional top two insurance payouts. In response, carriers are issuing cancellation notices for properties with sidewalks they deem risky. At one time, the city was liable for mishaps caused by sidewalks it owns, but it was paying out so much money for alleged trip-and-falls that it made it the sidewalk owners\u2019 responsibility. It carved out an exception for owner-occupied residential properties of one to three units.\nElsewhere\u2026\nI don\u2019t wish ill on anyone. At the same time, I don\u2019t feel especially sorry for people who complain about\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s accurate coverage of their problems.\nA common sequence:\nThey love\nTRD\nwhen we cover the early successes that mark their arrival as real estate players.\nSomething goes wrong, and they complain when we cover it. A typical complaint is that it\u2019s not newsworthy and will be fixed immediately, so we should not run the story, or at least hold it until the problem is fixed.\nThe problem isn\u2019t fixed immediately.\nSimilar problems\nstart popping up\nat the complainer\u2019s other properties. We cover them, triggering more arguments that we are unfairly picking on this person.\nThe complainer begins to endure a wave of defaults,\nforeclosures\n, lawsuits and sometimes\nindictments\n.\nThe complaints to\nTRD\nstop, as the embattled businessperson realizes there are bigger issues to deal with than negative media coverage.\nWhat made me think of this? Could it have been the latest news about\nToby Moskovits\n?\nClosing time\nBecause of the election, there is no data to report today. Check back tomorrow to see the city\u2019s top closings and listings.",

        "content": "Cityview\nis looking to turn an office complex in Irvine into housing.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm has filed plans for a 422-unit residential building at the two-building Newport Summit office park at 19600 and 19700 Fairchild Road, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. Newport Summit as it stands totals about 111,500 square feet.\nCityview acquired the property in March of this year from an affiliate of TPG Angelo Gordon for $34.5 million, or about $309 per square foot. New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon held a stake in the property since 2018. The office complex has traded hands at least seven times since 2007, with past owners including EQ Office,\nLincoln Property\n, Bixby Land Company and Maguire Properties, per CoStar data cited by the Business Journal. For the latest deal, Cityview got a $20.5 million loan from Banc of California.\nIn addition to the residences, Cityview is also looking to incorporate some retail along with the multifamily residential units. A timeline for the project has not been disclosed.\nIt\u2019s the latest residential project planned near the University of California, Irvine Health\u2019s new hospital on Jamboree Road. Uptown Newport, a mix of for-sale and rental units proposed by\nShopoff Realty Investments\n, is across Jamboree Road; that project is being built in phases and first opened for rentals about six years ago. The UCI Health\u2013Irvine complex\u2019s main hospital is slated to open for patients in December.\nOther housing projects are being considered for other nearby office sites in Irvine and\nNewport Beach\n. J+R Group, for example, has\nfiled plans\nto turn part of an eight-story, 178,000-square-foot office building at 1901 Main Street into 76 homes.\nIrvine Company, headquartered in Newport Beach, is\nlooking to build up to 2,500 new housing units near UCI\nin the nearby University Research Park. On the other side of town, the\nDonald Bren\n-led firm is planning to build 1,500 single-family homes and 1,600 apartments on the site of the\nOak Creek Golf Club\n; that plan calls for converting a nearby office complex into a school.\nThe City of Irvine must plan for 23,610 new homes by 2029 as part of its\nRegional Housing Needs Assessment\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An Oregon investor is the latest to shop at the bottom of Chicago\u2019s battered office market, snapping up a Wacker Drive tower at a deep discount to its last sale.\nPortland-based Menashe Properties bought\n125 South Wacker Drive\nfrom Canada\u2019s La Caisse last week, Costar\nreported\n. La Caisse is the real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s largest pension fund.\nMenashe CEO Jordan Menashe declined to provide the selling price for the 547,000-square-foot building, but a person familiar with the deal told the outlet it was $51.5 million.\nThat would be $94 per square foot and a 65 percent drop from the $145 million that La Caisse, then operating as\nIvanho\u00e9 Cambridge\n, paid for the 31-story building in 2017.\nThe sale adds to a growing list of downtown office trades closing at fractions of pre-pandemic valuations, as investors bet on the sector\u2019s long-term recovery despite high vacancy, remote-work headwinds and expensive financing.\nFor Menashe, who entered Chicago\u2019s market two years ago, the purchase fits a pattern. His firm bought the nearby\n230 West Monroe\nStreet tower for $45 million in September 2023 \u2014 another sharp markdown that\u2019s since turned into a success story. That property, Menashe said, has been stabilized with about 50 new leases and renewals.\n\u201cThis is very similar to 230,\u201d Menashe told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a pure lease-up play.\u201d\nMenashe said he plans to add eight to 10 move-in-ready spec suites to fill the roughly 37 percent of the Wacker building that remains vacant.\nWhile 125 South Wacker sits across from\nWillis Tower\n, it caters to smaller tenants occupying less than a full floor \u2014 a niche Menashe says is increasingly underserved.\n\u201cTake out ghost buildings that can\u2019t transact, and figure that nothing new will be built for five or six years, and we\u2019re under-officed,\u201d he said, arguing that constrained supply will eventually lift values.\nLa Caisse invested $21 million in renovations to 125 South Wacker during its ownership, upgrading mechanical systems, common areas and amenities. JLL began marketing the tower for sale in April.\nMenashe said he sees early signs of an office market recovery. A recent Costar analysis projects U.S. office occupancy to rise by 10 million square feet over the next year \u2014 a reversal from earlier expectations of decline.\n\u201cPeople went from office curious to office serious,\u201d Menashe said. \u201cThat goes for everywhere from Chicago to Portland. The word is out \u2014 and that will push prices up.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, buyers are finding other ways to connect with sellers to test compliance with\nfair housing\nlaws, though correspondence could still be an option in some cases.\n\u201cIn lieu of the letter, we\u2019re able to, in an above-board way, communicate a little bit about the buyer,\u201d Alexander Lurie of City Real Estate said. \u201cWe just need to be thoughtful about how we communicate those things.\u201d\nFive years ago, the\nCalifornia Association of Realtors\nfirst advised sellers\u2019 agents not to take buyers\u2019 love letters because of potential unconscious bias toward legally protected groups. What could be a simple letter describing a family or romantic situation may instead open a door to discrimination.\n\u201cAs lawyers, it\u2019s our job to be paranoid and worry about these things,\u201d Gov Hutchinson, CAR\u2019s assistant general counsel, said.\nNow, CAR advises agents to not accept offers that come with a love letter; in fact, they are told to get ahead of it before any come in by announcing that none will be accepted. Sellers and their agents are largely following the guidance.\n\u201cSo much of what happens with offers is about communication and relationships, and the last thing I want to do is alienate the listing agent by giving them a letter they don\u2019t want,\u201d Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate said.\nThat\u2019s not to say the love letter has completely fizzled. In fact, in some situations, sharing some personal information with listing agents has proven to help buyers seal the deal. \u201cThose things happen, not as often, but they do happen,\u201d\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno\nagent Colin Halliday said.\nStill, buyers are advised to stay away from sharing personal anecdotes with sellers to avoid jeopardizing potential sales, even if unconscious bias on the part of the seller would violate fair housing laws.\n\u201cSellers like to envision who\u2019s buying this house that they like so much and put so much effort into,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cBut also, sellers, consciously or subconsciously, probably tend to favor people who are like them. That\u2019s the risk.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The price works out to $64 per square foot.\nTenants of the 1.1 million-square-foot complex include Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Ross Dress for Less, Hobby Lobby and Cinemark. The mall\u2019s only vacant anchor space was once occupied by a Sears that closed in 2020. Built in the 1960s, the Southland Mall\u2019s retail spaces were built to accommodate Sears.\nIt\u2019s the latest West Coast play for the Long Island-based investor, which has built a national portfolio by buying regional malls and shopping centers that other asset managers have ignored.\nNamdar\u2019s value-added commercial real estate\nstrategy involves minimal upfront investment followed by gradual upgrades to boost income and value.\nNot everyone has embraced Namdar\u2019s approach.\nCity officials in Citrus Heights, near Sacramento, attempted condemnation proceedings this summer against the portions of the Sunrise Mall owned by a Namdar affiliate. The city found \u201cextensive violations\u201d after community complaints in May.\nNamdar also got into a fracas with Chicago suburb\nCalumet City\nthis year, after the city tried to use eminent domain to take control of a mall redevelopment.\nBrookfield marketed Southland Mall as having long-term fundamentals, citing strong freeway visibility and little competition in the area.\nBesides that property, in the Bay Area, Namdar also owns the West Valley Mall in Tracy.\nHalfway across the country, last month, Namdar picked up another distressed retail property: the 170,000-square-foot retail space at\n1 North State Street in Chicago\n. The firm paid $8.3 million, or $49 per square foot, for the retail portion of the office building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The move strengthens Corgan\u2019s foothold in the Northeast while adding cultural clout and urban design muscle to its roster.\nThe deal, signed Oct. 31, marks Corgan\u2019s second East Coast acquisition this year, following its August purchase of Boston\u2019s Dyer Brown &amp; Associates. Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but the 20-person Cooper Robertson team will merge into Corgan\u2019s 1,200-strong workforce while maintaining its office in New York\u2019s Financial District.\nFounded in Dallas in 1938,\nCorgan\nis best known for designing headquarters for Toyota, State Farm and 7-Eleven, and more recently, space for hospitals and data centers. It occupies about 110,000 square feet at The Luminary in downtown Dallas\u2019 West End and reported $510.5 million in revenue last year, with roughly three-quarters generated locally, according to the outlet.\nCooper Robertson, meanwhile, has long been a fixture in New York\u2019s cultural and urban landscape. Its credits include the New Museum and\nStudio Museum\nin Harlem, as well as the master plans for\nBattery Park City\nand\nHudson Yards\n. The merger unites Corgan\u2019s reputation for technical precision with Cooper Robertson\u2019s pedigree in civic and cultural design.\nCorgan CEO Scott Ruch said the acquisition reinforces the firm\u2019s commitment to \u201cdesign excellence across more typologies.\u201d Cooper Robertson partner Mike Aziz called the merger \u201ca powerful alignment of design values and vision,\u201d pointing to Corgan\u2019s research-driven approach and his firm\u2019s experience with large-scale planning and public architecture.\nWith offices now spanning Dallas, Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., along with hubs in the U.K., Dublin and Singapore, Corgan\u2019s latest move positions it as one of the most geographically diverse American design firms still privately held.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A retail village with 80,000 square feet for up to eight restaurants, a 317-unit apartment complex and office space are also part of the phase-two plans.\nConstruction financing comes from Madison Realty Capital, while Citizens Bank, Amegy Bank and others are backing the apartment and retail components.\nThe Birdsall will feature 44 condos above a 105-key hotel, topped by resident amenities including a pool, outdoor entertainment deck, fitness and wellness spaces and a members-only club.\nDesigned by New York-based Kohn Pedersen Fox with interiors by Roman &amp; Williams and Dillon Kyle Architects, the tower nods to River Oaks\u2019 architectural heritage \u2014 its name honoring early Houston architect Birdsall Briscoe.

Retail leasing, led by Transwestern, has drawn strong early interest from restaurant and boutique operators.\nThe RO site once housed ExxonMobil\u2019s upstream division.\nTranswestern is a commercial real estate firm that includes Transwestern Development Company, Transwestern Investment Group and Transwestern Real Estate Services.

However, Higgins did not capture more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.\nThe race featured 13 candidates, but the real drama involved three contenders whose families have lorded over Miami politics since the 1980s. City commissioner\nJoe Carollo\n, who returned to city hall in 2017 after serving two terms as mayor from 1998 to 2001, mustered only 12 percent of the vote in his latest bid for Miami\u2019s top elected post. Carollo raised nearly $1 million, with many big name real estate players financially backing him.\nXavier Suarez, another former Miami mayor and father of the current mayor,\nFrancis Suarez\n; and Alex Diaz de la Portilla, an ex-city commissioner who was removed from office in 2023, each garnered 5 percent of the vote. Diaz de la Portilla is a former state legislator whose brothers Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Miguel Diaz de la Portilla also served stints as county and state elected officials.\nCarollo\u2019s political action committee, Miami First, relied heavily on real estate industry contributions, despite a federal jury slapping Carollo with a\n$63 million\njudgment after finding him guilty of violating the rights of Little Havana developers\nBill Fuller\nand Martin Pinilla. Entities controlled by JDS Development Group\u2019s\nMichael Stern\ndonated a combined $125,000 to Miami First. Stern\u2019s firm is developing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded condo-hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nEntities managed by Nuri Dorra, who is co-developing Essence Miami, a multifamily project with 88 affordable and workforce housing apartments in Little Havana, contributed a combined $120,000 to Miami First.\nDiaz de la Portilla\u2019s biggest support came from real estate investors\nDavid and Leila Centner\n. The Miami Beach power couple donated $100,000 to Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s political action committee, Proven Leadership for Miami-Dade County. The contribution represented nearly half of the committee\u2019s haul in the three months ended in June. The PAC reported zero contributions between July and September, the most recent campaign finance filing period.\nMeanwhile, Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\nand Blanca Commercial Real Estate each contributed $10,000 to Suarez\u2019s Imagine Miami PAC.\nHiggins resigned from her county commission seat less than a year after being reelected without opposition to run for Miami mayor. Her individual campaign and three political action committees supporting her collected five-figure donations from several prominent developers.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\ncontributed a combined $67,500, and\nRelated Group\n, also based in Coconut Grove and led by Jorge, Nick and Jon Paul P\u00e9rez, donated a combined $50,000. Swerdlow Group, led by Michael Swerdlow, Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, and land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes each gave $10,000 to committees backing Higgins. Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of 13th Floor Investments, donated $2,500.\n13th Floor Investments, Terra, Swerdlow Group and Bercow Radell also gave money to Carollo\u2019s Miami First PAC. Swerdlow contributed $50,000, 13th Floor donated $25,000, Bercow and Radell kicked in $10,000 and Terra chipped in $2,500.\nGonzalez, who testified against Carollo in the civil case brought by Fuller and Pinilla, successfully sued the city of Miami to hold the election this year, alleging city leaders violated the city charter in approving a delay of the election until next year. Six entities tied to Fuller and Pinilla donated a combined $20,000 to Gonzalez\u2019s Mission Miami PAC.\nKen Russell, a former city commissioner who was among the 13 mayoral candidates, placed third. His PAC, Breaking The Wheel, received a $10,000 donation from Miami-based CMC Group, led by Ugo Columbo.",

        "content": "A development site straddling the border between Queens and Brooklyn sold this week, but that\u2019s where the answers end and the questions begin.\nRenald Properties sold a seven-lot assemblage at the intersection of Myrtle and Wyckoff avenues for $37 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 71,000-square-foot site is technically in Ridgewood, but is nearly adjacent to Bushwick.\nThe buyer was not revealed, but the price point represented one of the year\u2019s biggest deals in the area, according to the transaction brokers.\nThe site comprises 21 retail businesses, including an autobody shop, a department store and a McDonald\u2019s. The buyer would need to clear the businesses to make way for a development, in whatever form such a project takes shape.\nAnd there are options. The site allows for development up to 339,000 square feet large. Almost half of that could be put aside for residential use. But the mystery buyer has not filed any construction permits, adding to the site\u2019s intrigue. The population of the two neighborhoods have exploded in recent decades, creating a need for more housing.\nIn September, the average rent in Queens declined by a couple of cups of coffee compared to the prior month, landing at $3,051, according to\nMNS Real Estate\n. Ridgewood was in the middle of the pack in terms of prices across the borough\u2019s neighborhoods, sporting an average of $2,599 for studios and $2,857 for one-bedroom units.\nBrooklyn\n\u2019s average rent in September also fell to $3,932, down nearly 1 percent from August. Bushwick proved to be one of the borough\u2019s more affordable rental environments, recording an average of $2,638 for studios and $3,178 for one-bedroom apartments.\nAvison Young\u2019s Erik Edeen, Pat Madigan and Fritz Richter represented the seller.\n\u201cThis nearly full-block assemblage will be transformed to deliver mixed-income housing and refreshed retail space along a highly trafficked corridor as demand for housing continues to increase in Bushwick and Ridgewood,\u201d Madigan said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach voters propelled Mayor Steven Meiner and city commissioner Laura Dominguez to second terms, while two candidates vying for an open city commission seat are headed to a runoff.\nMeiner\ncaptured 51 percent of the vote, beating his lone challenger, city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, by about 350 ballots, election results show. Dominguez thumped her opponent, spec home developer\nFred Karlton\n. She garnered more than 60 percent of the vote, despite a campaign by Karlton and city commissioner David Suarez to paint her as beholden to real estate developers in the city. Another city commissioner, Alex Fernandez, also won by a wide margin, capturing 84 percent of the vote against his opponent, Luidgi Mary.\nThe race for the city commission seat vacated by\nRosen Gonzalez\nwill be decided next month in a runoff between former city commission aide Monica Matteo-Salinas, who picked up 23 percent of the vote, and attorney Monique Pardo Pope, who landed in second place with 20 percent of the vote. But Pardo Pope led hotel investor Brian Ehrlich by less than a percentage point. If the margin drops to less than 0.5 percent, it would trigger an automatic recount.\nMeiner\nalso bested Rosen Gonzalez in garnering financial support from the city\u2019s real estate and hospitality industries. Players backing the mayor included Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller, who lives in Miami Beach. Miller donated $50,000 to Meiner\u2019s political action committee Miami Beach First.\nThe PAC also racked up $25,000 from real estate investor and Miami Beach resident Michael Simkins; $20,000 from David Grutman, founder of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality; $18,000 from Alex Kleyner, another Miami Beach-based real estate investor; and $10,000 each from Miami Beach developer Scott Robins and New York-based Naftali Group, led by Miki Naftali.\nIn the race between\nDominguez\nand Karlton, real estate and hospitality players lined up behind the incumbent. Karlton bankrolled his own campaign by donating $150,000 to it.\nDominguez\u2019s individual campaign saw many real estate and hospitality bigwigs donating the maximum $1,000 each, including developer Michael Shvo; Jose and Diego Ardid, developers who lead Miami-based Key International; New York-based LeFrak Organization\u2019s managing director James LeFrak and a LeFrak affiliate; and two executives with Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group.\nDuring the campaign, Karlton and commissioner Suarez attacked Dominguez by claiming she voted on legislation that benefitted developers that bankrolled her political action committee, Coastal Communities Matter, when she first ran in a 2022 special election. Dominguez did not raise funds through her committee for this year\u2019s election.\nIn the city commission race headed to a runoff, Ehrlich was the candidate backed by real estate and hospitality interests. His individual campaign received the maximum $1,000 donation from Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Coconut Grove-based development firm 13th Floor Investments, his wife Rebecca Karsenti, the Catalina Hotel at 1732 Collins Avenue, and two entities managed by Miami Beach-based real estate investor Jimmy Resnick.\nEhrlich\u2019s PAC, Miami Beach in Focus, got $25,000 from hotelier Shawn Vardi, and $5,000 from Christopher Cuomo, ex-COO of Groot Hospitality.",

The district turned out for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election by a\nnearly 60-point margin\n.\nRehmet, an Air Force veteran and union president, is the only candidate left standing who is open to casinos in a race where Sands Casino threw millions of dollars behind a Republican who was knocked out in Tuesday\u2019s special election.\nRehmet is headed for a runoff with conservative Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who is staunchly\nanti-casino\nand spent the campaign engaging in a war of words with Republican challenger John Huffman, the former mayor of Southlake. Wambsganss had 36 percent of early voting, and Huffman had 16 percent.\nSands donated $1 million directly to Huffman\u2019s campaign and spent $2 million to advertise on his behalf.\nSands wants to build casino resorts in Texas, and it is flexing all of its muscles after buying the Dallas Mavericks and 200 acres adjacent to the Texas Stadium site in Irving in recent years.\nThe company, controlled by Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont, rezoned a 182-acre tract in March, though a\ncasino component was removed\nafter public backlash.\nAdelson is a major donor to President Donald Trump, giving his campaign\n$100 million\nlast year. Will the Israeli-American magnate cross party lines and endorse a pro-casino Democrat?\nWambsganss, who is chief communications officer for Christian wireless provider Patriot Mobile, is backed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate and opposes casino gambling. Wambsganss also drew nods from state Sen. Tan Parker, Tarrant County Judge Tim O\u2019Hare and state Rep. Nate Schatzline, who withdrew from the race after Wambsganss entered it.\nEven without the casino intrigue, it was an unusual ballot.\nTwo Republicans were pitted against a Democrat in the special election to replace Republican Kelly Hancock, who resigned to become acting state comptroller after holding the seat since 2013. No primary election was required.\nIf no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the two top vote-getters will head to a runoff election on Dec. 13.\n",

Nazarian\u2019s partners include Grammy-winning artist\nMarc Anthony\n.\nThe development team, including the Boschetti family\u2019s South Miami-based firm and Eduardo Otaola\u2019s Coral Gables-based Constellation, tapped Mauricio Umansky and Santiago Arana\u2019s\nThe Agency\nto lead sales and marketing.\nThe project will add to a growing pipeline of condo and apartment towers in Edgewater.\nNazarian\n, chairman and CEO of Beverly Hills-based sbe, told\nTRD\nin an interview that the project will fill a gap in Miami between the short-term rental-friendly condo projects that are less expensive and the $3 million-plus condos.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luxury residential projects today. One thing we saw was there was a lack of personality and connectivity and collaboration in these towers,\u201d he said.\nCamilo Lopez, managing partner and co-CEO of Coral Gables-based\nBlack Salmon\n, said he interviewed more than 10 brands before choosing HQ.\nLopez said nearly 65 projects are in the pipeline in Greater Downtown Miami, and a majority of those are short-term rental-friendly condo projects. HQ Residences will be a traditional condo building with prices that start at $850,000 and average $1.5 million, Lopez said.\nNazarian and Lopez said the project aims to appeal to Millennials and Gen Zers, and Latino/Hispanic buyers. Units will range from one to three bedrooms and from 721 square feet to 2,074 square feet, according to a press release. The project will also have eight penthouses.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in Miami is the entry level [price] is becoming extremely high,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThis opportunity to design this product in this price point makes sense.\u201d\nThe building will mark the first residential tower branded by HQ, a hotel brand that Nazarian launched last year. Anthony will be involved in the Miami project and future branded residential developments.\n\u201c[Marc] is somebody who is the face of Miami,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cHaving him be a validator for the largest buyers of residential, the Hispanic and Latino market, it\u2019s very exciting for me to partner with Marc and bring him into his first residential project in South Florida.\u201d\nConstruction could begin by September of next year, and it will take about 30 months to complete, Lopez said. The project will cost about $1,100 to $1,200 per square foot to build, and presales will start at about $1,400 per square foot.\nThe project\u2019s top two floors, totaling nearly 16,000 square feet, will feature amenities focused on wellness, entertainment and art, and will include a private club. The 34th floor will be designed by The Well Founder Kane Sarhan, and feature yoga, hammam, sauna, steam, plunge pools and bath house treatments; a fitness center, treatment rooms and a pool deck with lounges. The top story will have entertainment and social components, including Sofia Vergara and her son Manolo Vergara\u2019s Toma Gourmet restaurant; Jack\u2019s NYC Coffee; and Marc\u2019s, a speakeasy curated by Anthony.\nBernardo Fort Brescia\u2019s Arquitectonica is the architect, and Enzo Enea is the landscape architect. DesignAgency and Craft will design the interiors.\nNazarian worked with Related Group and its partners on a handful of South Florida branded condo projects in the last real estate cycle, which included SLS Lux, SLS Midtown and Hyde Midtown in Miami, and Hyde buildings in Hallandale Beach. Now, he said he\u2019s in talks with Black Salmon to brand additional condo projects in South Florida under the HQ flag.\n",

The asking rent was $125 per square foot.\nCurrent is relocating from RXR\u2019s 620 Sixth Avenue, where it leased about 72,000 square feet in 2023,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. A Current spokesperson declined to comment on the new lease.\nThe deal adds to Vornado\u2019s momentum at the Penn District, where chairman and CEO Steven Roth declared yesterday in an earnings call that \u201cit\u2019s clear that the tipping point \u2026 is now behind us.\u201d Penn 2 recently underwent a $750 renovation aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants. The 31-story tower is now 78 percent leased.\nCurrent Real Estate Advisors\u2019 Adam Hennick and Rob Kluge represented Current in the deal. Vornado was represented in-house by Josh Glick and Jared Silverman, along with a Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Bruce Mosler and Josh Kuriloff.\nThe deal comes as the office market shows signs of stabilizing and Manhattan\u2019s Class A towers are quickly filling up. The Penn Station submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was about 19 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with the borough\u2019s overall rate of 22 percent, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. Communications and consulting firm\nFGS Global\njust signed a 15-year lease for 80,000 square feet at Penn 2. Last summer, Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nwith plans to move its headquarters to the 1.8 million-square-foot building, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza.\nOther tenants include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n",

After waiting months for the notoriously anal landmarks agency to decide which color mortar it would allow for a brick facade, he\ntweeted a photo\nof the three choices facing the commission:\nI\u2019d probably go with the middle one. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. The point is, none of these mortar colors is going to destroy the historic look of the building. The highly trained preservationists at the LPC should have been able to pick one in 60 seconds, not 60 days.\nThe agency thinks it\u2019s protecting historic districts by being painstakingly thorough and exacting, but the opposite is true. Because it is so slow, and makes work two or three times more expensive and time-consuming, property owners often do things without getting LPC approval as required.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why if you walk around in a historic district, you often notice minor repairs obviously not done to LPC standards,\u201d Lever noted in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. The result of the commission\u2019s overzealousness may well be less historic preservation, not more.\nBut the bigger problem for New Yorkers seeking affordability \u2014 like Mamdani \u2014 is that by making construction and renovation more expensive, the city ends up with less housing than it would otherwise have. That\u2019s a basic rule of economics.\nI asked Lever if it would have been cheaper to just pick a mortar color and proceed without the agency\u2019s blessing, paying a fine as needed. Not an option, he said. For renovations requiring building permits, LPC approval is essential.\n\u201cThis is where the wait can be a killer, but there isn\u2019t really a choice,\u201d Lever said. \u201cDoing a job without permits opens up a whole host of issues, over and above the LPC violation.\u201d\nThe people hired by Landmarks to enforce its standards have a lot of expertise about what buildings looked like a century or two ago, or at least the motivation to research and apply 19th-century standards to today\u2019s owners and contractors.\nWhat they appear to lack is any appreciation of how their decisions \u2014 and the time it takes to make them \u2014 affect the real estate industry and everyday New Yorkers.\nStaffers are surely aware that\nlandmarking has its critics\n. But art history majors with graduate degrees in historic preservation inevitably view applications through the lens of their education, not think-tank reports and the odd online gripe by a developer. \u201cPreservationists really struggle with change,\u201d a former LPC staffer\ntold Brooklyn Magazine\n.\nI\u2019m not saying the city should trash the landmarks system, although there is a case to be made for that. I am saying that when choices involve benefits and costs, both should be considered.\nIt can\u2019t just be \u201cit costs what it costs\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll take as long as we need to make a decision.\u201d\nI would suggest the City Council apply a builder\u2019s remedy to Landmarks: If the agency doesn\u2019t decide on an application in X number of days, it is automatically approved. I guarantee that timely decisions would immediately become the norm. LPC would lobby for more staff but would ultimately adjust its methods to meet the deadlines.\nMy second reform would be to stop designating new historic districts. We have enough.\nBy definition, any buildings left standing long enough become historic. Taken to its logical conclusion, the entire city will eventually be landmarked.\nNew York is not Pompeii. The city should not be frozen in time.\nTo see the effects of landmarking on housing development, one need only look at the\nSoho/Noho rezoning\nof 2021.\nIt was supposed to create thousands of units. But developers are\navoiding the historic portion\nof the rezoned area as if it were a toxic waste dump. Building there would mean competing with projects that cost less \u2014 an uphill, if not futile, battle.\nSome buyers and renters will pay extra to be in a new development built to LPC\u2019s specifications, but perhaps not enough to make a project pencil out. And keep in mind that affordable units, which are required in rezoned areas and in 485x projects, cannot charge a premium.\nWe are leaving housing on the table \u2014 in high-opportunity neighborhoods, no less.\nLandmarking was a nice idea, but it has reached the point of diminishing returns. The benefits of more landmarking do not outweigh the drawbacks. The main thing Landmarks is preserving now is the housing shortage.\nAbout 20 percent of Manhattan, which has the city\u2019s densest zoning and the most investment in transit, is now subject to the strict scrutiny of the LPC. Continuing this way would be a historic mistake.\n",

        "content": "A trio of billionaires received good news from the Miami Beach Planning Board on Tuesday.\nThe board approved items related to hedge fund manager\nKen Griffin\u2019s private yacht marina\non Terminal Island, and tweaks to Vlad Doronin and Len Blavatnik\u2019s Aman Miami Beach development.\nGriffin, founder and CEO of Miami-based Citadel, secured conditional use approval to redevelop the 3.7-acre property at 120 MacArthur Causeway into a 30,000-plus-square-foot private marina with a crew pavilion, owner\u2019s suite, a pool and more.\nGriffin\nowns a 308-foot Viva superyacht with interior design by Peter Marino, according to Superyacht Fan.\nGriffin relocated the headquarters for Citadel and its sister firm Citadel Securities to Miami from Chicago in 2022 and plans to develop a\n$2.5 billion\nbayfront supertall for the firms\u2019 main offices in Brickell. The 1.3 million-square-foot project will include a 212-key hotel, spa, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and more.\nIn addition to assembling land for a massive residential compound in Palm Beach, the Daytona Beach native purchased homes in Miami and Miami Beach.\nThe Terminal Island marina project, designed by BMA Architects, will include a gatehouse at the entrance of the marina with security offices and an operations center with a repair shop and marina staff offices.\nGriffin\u2019s attorney, Neisen Kasdin, co-managing partner of Akerman\u2019s Miami office, agreed to a handful of conditions on behalf of his client.\nBoard members raised concerns about the effect that special events held at the marina pavilion will have on traffic and noise, especially with the U.S. Coast Guard nearby.\nTuesday\u2019s approval requires Coast Guard consent for special events and progress reports every two years. All parking has to be self-contained on Terminal Island. Griffin can\u2019t host any special events until a temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. And if ownership of the property changes hands, any future owner has to return to the board.\nThe planning board also approved a comprehensive plan amendment and floor area ratio (FAR) preservation incentive within the Faena District that will allow billionaires Vlad Doronin and Len Blavatnik to add 5,000 square feet of floor area ratio (FAR) to the hotel component of\nAman Miami Beach\n, so that the developer can take advantage of empty space and make it mechanical space.\nDoronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group is the developer, and Blavatnik\u2019s New York-based Access Industries is backing the oceanfront project at 3425 Collins Avenue.\nIt will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in a new 18-story building, and the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure, which is currently a shell.\nIn August, an affiliate of New York-based Golden Tree Asset Management provided $85 million in mezzanine financing, adding to the\n$277 million-plus in debt\nprovided by Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK in 2020 and 2023. Vertical construction began around the same time and the project is now expected to be completed in 2027, and construction has been moving quickly since August, Kasdin said at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He is also representing the Aman development team.\n\u201cConstruction is progressing rapidly at this point\u2026 You\u2019ll see the residential tower is starting to come above ground. We\u2019re going to be pouring the fifth floor before Thanksgiving, and then it will continue to top out into the new year,\u201d Kasdin said.\n",

The property, at 715 South Hudson Avenue, is a slim surface parking lot.\nCIM Group acquired the four-block campus in 2014 after the insurance giant moved to\nWarner Center\n.

Designs are being handled by Bassenian Legoni with KFA Architecture serving as architect and Agency Artifact as landscape architect.\nSince acquiring the property more than a decade ago,\nCIM Group\nhas sought to redevelop two of the blocks at Wilshire Boulevard and Mullen Avenue with condominiums and single-family homes. The top two floors of an adjacent office building at 4750 Wilshire Boulevard have since been converted into 68 apartments by a CIM affiliate.\nMeanwhile, in West Adams, CIM is pursuing another residential development, a mixed-use endeavor at\n5451 West Adams Boulevard\n. The company is seeking approvals for a six-story, 103,000-square-foot building with 142 apartments above 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 99-space parking garage.

Greene Custom Builders in 2022, is tucked within the north suburban enclave known for its large lots and strong school district.

That put losses for the nine months ending Sept. 30 at $294.3 million.\nThe office and studio investor blamed the slump on the deconsolidation of\nSunset Glenoaks\n, a $200 million purpose-built studio developed by Hudson Pacific Properties in partnership with Blackstone. It\u2019s only 8 percent leased after being delivered last year.\nOffice and studio revenues decreased in the third quarter compared to a year ago, too, so total revenues came out to $186.6 million compared to $200.4 million a year ago, which the company said was due to lower office occupancy and depreciated asset sales.\nWhen it comes to its balance sheet, Hudson Pacific said it is in no rush to sell and has no maturities until the second half of next year. However, that next maturity is a big one \u2014 the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to its Hollywood Media portfolio, which has a more than $1 billion outstanding balance.\nThe company inked 515,000 square feet of leases in the third quarter, which amounts to 1.7 million square feet year to date. The deals included a 106,000-square-foot lease with an artificial intelligence company at its Page Mill Center offices in Palo Alto. The company said this was its best year-to-date leasing performance since 2019, before the pandemic.\n\u201cLeasing, leasing, and then more leasing,\u201d Hudson Pacific chairman and chief executive Victor Coleman said on an earnings call Wednesday morning when discussing the path ahead.\nAbout 80 percent of third quarter leasing activity occurred at the company\u2019s Bay Area assets, mostly via technology and artificial intelligence tenants, which led Coleman to tout evidence of an office recovery on the West Coast.\nBut about a million square feet of leases are set to expire next year, affecting 8 percent of its portfolio.\nThe company\u2019s office portfolio is picking up as the San Francisco technology world booms. Meanwhile, studios are dragging as the Los Angeles TV and film production industry stalls.\nTwenty-two of the company\u2019s 40 office holdings are in the Bay Area; almost all of its studios are in L.A. Coleman said he sees a return in studio demand, noting California\u2019s recent tax credit expansion that has revealed some early promise in incentivising projects.\nShares rose during the earnings call, so it seems investors liked what they heard despite the millions in losses the company posted.\n",

At $470,000 per unit, it could pay for 276,000 units. The city is trying to erase an 82,000-unit shortage.\nOpenAI has pledged to use the money to fund research to treat and cure diseases and to implement guardrails against AI. Tackling wealth inequality and building isn\u2019t a part of the plan.\n\u201cIf we could somehow make it so that you could graduate from school and buy a home and start your family on a normal salary, that would have a huge positive impact on society,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us can make that happen.\u201d\nThe growth of AI firms like OpenAI and the need for employees have\ndriven up housing demand\n\u2014\nand rents\n\u2014 in the city.\nSan Francisco must meet its state-mandated requirement of building at least 82,069 housing units by 2031 as part of its\nhousing element\n. The city\u2019s current plans would only provide for less than half of that number, according to a\nrecent report from the city controller\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Louis C.K. sold his Shelter Island home for above its most recent asking price, but the comedian may not have the last laugh.\nThe controversial comedian unloaded Primrose Cottage at 9-7 Westmoreland Drive to an undisclosed buyer for $4.35 million, Behind the Hedges\nreported\n. That represented a $50,000 premium on the Tudor-style residence\u2019s last asking price.\nThe deal for the 2.2-acre, 5,000-square-foot home breaks down to $870 per square foot. There are six bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms, as well as a 20-by-50-foot heated gunite pool, a hot tub and a brick patio.\nThe deal could be a disappointment for C.K. He listed the property for nearly $8 million last September before knocking down the asking price in August to $4.3 million; the home went under contract that same month and the deal closed on Halloween.\nThe waterfront estate once welcomed esteemed guests, including presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William McKinley and sports superstar Babe Ruth. The home includes a deepwater dock on West Neck Creek with room for multiple boats.\nC.K. purchased the property in 2014 for $2.44 million, spending the next decade restoring and modernizing the home. Updates included central air conditioning, upgraded heating and insulation for more energy efficiency. The comedian also made notable changes to the chef\u2019s kitchen and added a butler\u2019s pantry.\nCarl Gambino and Marco Maida of The Gambino Group at Compass had the listing.\nIn late 2022, C.K. sold his Greenwich Village co-op at 101 West 12th Street for\n$1.8 million\n. He\nbought the co-op\nin 2016 for $2.45 million, $55,000 above the asking price. He resigned himself to a loss on the apartment when he\nslashed the asking price\nby 25 percent, dropping it to $1.9 million from its $2.5 million initial ask.\nThe comedian is best known for his comedy series, \u201cLouie,\u201d which aired on FX for five seasons.\nC.K. issued a statement in 2017 confirming allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women. Despite the admission, he resurfaced on the comedy circuit a year later and recently performed at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "To be a leader in the booming data center sector, firms need more than the requisite real estate, which CBRE has acknowledged with a ten-figure acquisition.\nThe Dallas-based real estate brokerage firm paid $1.2 billion to acquire Pearce Services from alternative investment manager New Mountain Capital, Bisnow\nreported\n. The deal closed only a few weeks after CBRE alluded to a potential acquisition of this magnitude during its earnings call.\n\u201cThis acquisition complements our large and growing presence in digital and power infrastructure,\u201d CBRE chief executive officer Bob Sulentic said in a statement.\nPearce provides design, engineering, maintenance and repair services for power and telecommunications companies, servicing data center and infrastructure assets. Those services\nare critical\nfor an asset type that has such a large energy demand as well as concerns about impact on local communities.\nFor this year, CBRE estimates more than a third of Pearce\u2019s business will come from working with critical power and cooling systems. A large portion will also come from renewable energy, power storage and wireless and fiber network services.\nPearce is expected to generate $660 million in revenue next year, according to CBRE. Meanwhile, the brokerage brought in $700 million in revenue from its data center services in the third quarter, a 40 percent rise year over year. CBRE\u2019s total third-quarter revenue was $10.2 billion.\nThis is at least the second notable acquisition of the year for CBRE.\nAt the beginning of 2025, the firm agreed to\nacquire\nthe remaining 60 percent stake of coworking company Industrious several years after an initial investment. The deal valued Industrious at approximately $800 million.\nLincoln Property Company recently\nbought\na 191,000-square-foot data center in one of the nation\u2019s biggest markets for the asset class, where vacancy is under 2 percent.\nThe Dallas-based company bought the data center at 2500 West Frye Road in Chandler and a substation on-site from CBRE Global Investment for $130 million. The price amounts to $681 per square foot or $4.6 million per megawatt.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Abraham Bergman, Opal Realty NY and The Scharf Group are planning a mixed-use project in Miami Beach, after buying a development site for $15.5 million.\nThe joint venture acquired two parcels at 7410 Collins Avenue and 7400 Harding Avenue in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood, near the planned\nOcean Terrace\ndevelopment by\nWitkoff\n, Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher, a press release states.\nBay Harbor Islands-based Benmark Capital, led by CEO Mark Simon, provided an $11.9 million acquisition loan. Bergman\u2019s New York-based Eastern Union brokered the mortgage, Simon told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cBecause of our ability to close quickly, Abe [Bergman] went with us,\u201d Simon said. \u201cTradiitonal banks are taking much longer to execute transactions like this. It\u2019s a great location. North Beach is undergoing a crazy transformation.\u201d\nThe seller, an affiliate of Royal Oak, Michigan-based Calvin Gaeta Development Company, paid $855,000 for the two parcels in 1986, records show.\nBergman, Opal Realty NY, led by Charles Hoffman, and The Scharf Group, led by Glenn Scharf, won approval last year from the city of Miami Beach to build two new five-story buildings spanning 90,000 square feet that will entail 12,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and 40,000 square feet of offices, city records show. The project will also restore and incorporate a historic retail building at 7410 Collins Avenue currently leased to CVS.\nIn addition, the joint venture is planning to include residential units, but the partnership has not decided if they will be units for sale or rent, a spokesperson said.\nThe joint venture plans to break ground next year, the release states.\nFounded in 2012, Opal Realty NY has $4 billion in commercial real estate assets under management, according to the firm\u2019s website. The Scharf Group is a family office founded in 1946.\nSince last year, Benmark Capital provided $13.6 million in financing for\nLa Baia North\n, the second phase of a condominium project in Bay Harbor Islands being developed by The Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company.\nNorth Beach is experiencing a wave of new projects. Lefferts is planning four condominiums in the neighborhood. In March, the firm began closings for\n72 Park\n, a 22-story tower with 206 short-term rental-friendly units. Lefferts is also developing the 126-unit Palm Miami Beach Residences, the 134-unit 72 Carlyle and an unnamed 36-unit boutique condominium in North Beach.\nNorthlink Capital is also planning a short-term rental-friendly condominium in North Beach. In April, the firm launched sales for\n7200 Collins\n, the 12-story, 222-unit building.",

        "content": "Suburban Harvey\u2019s finances are going from bad to worse.\nA new report from the Cook County treasurer\u2019s office shows\nThe south suburb has the third-lowest property tax collection rate in Cook County, underscoring the city\u2019s deepening fiscal emergency, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe county\ntreasurer\u2019s office reviewed\n2023\nproperty tax payments\none year after bills were sent out, capturing late payments and adjustments. While overall countywide collections have largely rebounded from early shortfalls, rates of payment in many\nsouth suburban towns\nremain \u201cperilously low,\u201d the office found.\nHarvey billed $57.9 million in taxes last year but collected only $33.75 million \u2014 a 58.29 percent rate \u2014 leaving more than $24 million unpaid.\nOnly Ford Heights, at 39 percent, and Robbins, at 57 percent, fared worse.\nNeighboring suburbs\nsuch as\nDolton\n, Chicago Heights and Calumet City also collected below 85 percent of what they were owed. A strong collection rate is around 95 percent, according to the Civic Federation.\nThe south suburbs have been reeling from steep tax hikes and lagging payments. Median tax bills jumped nearly 20 percent in 2023, the largest increase in almost three decades. That spike, combined with years of disinvestment, has left homeowners and businesses struggling to keep up \u2014 and city governments starved for the revenue they depend on.\nHarvey\u2019s government is now in partial shutdown, having furloughed more than 40 percent of its staff \u2014 including portions of its police, fire and public works departments \u2014 as it struggles to meet payroll.\nComplicating the issue is the questionable legality of Cook County\u2019s tax-lien sale practices. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the practice, but Illinois\nhasn\u2019t changed its laws\naround it. The conflict\nbrought tax sales to a standstill\nin Cook County and drew a\nclass-action lawsuit\n.\nHarvey Mayor Christopher Clark said at a recent City Council meeting that unpaid property taxes are a central reason the city is in crisis. Last month, Harvey\u2019s city council voted to seek relief under Illinois\u2019 Financially Distressed Cities Act, a designation previously reserved for East St. Louis.\n\u201cThe reason why the collection rate is so low is because of years of disinvestment,\u201d Clark said. \u201cOur high tax rate only makes things worse. It\u2019s a diminishing return.\u201d\nThe treasurer\u2019s report said Harvey leads all\nCook County suburbs\nin tax-delinquent properties \u2014 with more than 3,100 homes and 1,885 vacant lots owing back taxes.\nBusinesses are also lagging: 662 commercial properties owe roughly $9.2 million. Schools, city services and other taxing bodies in Harvey are owed $312.4 million in total unpaid taxes, with another $441 million in accumulated interest over two decades.\nClark has tried to compel payments by blocking access to parking lots at delinquent properties and denying business licenses, a tactic some city officials say has backfired.\n\u201cThe city is spending more time fighting entities that owe back taxes than finding equitable solutions,\u201d said Alderman Colby Chapman, who added that the problem is compounded by thousands of abandoned homes across the city.\nThe city\u2019s tax rate ranks among the highest in the county, while its collections rank among the lowest, meeting the criteria for state financial intervention.\n\u201cIt confirms why we\u2019re asking for help,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t run a city with these kinds of numbers and still expect to serve your citizens.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas homeowners and business owners are set for sweeping property tax relief after voters approved a pair of\nconstitutional amendments\naimed at easing one of the state\u2019s most persistent financial burdens.\nThe measures, passed Tuesday, raise the homestead exemption for school district taxes and expand\ntax breaks\nfor business inventory \u2014 changes that could reshape local revenue streams across the state, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe centerpiece of the package increases the state\u2019s homestead exemption \u2014 the portion of a home\u2019s value shielded from school property taxes \u2014 from $100,000 to $140,000. That translates to roughly $490 in annual savings for the owner of a typical $302,000 Texas home, according to the outlet.\nSeniors and homeowners with disabilities will see even larger cuts, following voter approval of a separate measure targeting those groups.\nBusinesses also won big. Voters approved a state constitutional amendment exempting up to $125,000 of a company\u2019s inventory from property taxes levied by school districts, cities and counties. Supporters argued the change will ease pressure on small and midsize firms, which have struggled with rising valuations and tight margins in recent years.\n\u201cThere is an absolute recognition of the need to provide property tax cuts for homeowners and business owners,\u201d said state\nSen. Paul Bettencourt\n, the Houston Republican who led the push. \u201cThe public embraces the idea that increasing homestead exemptions is a way to keep people in their homes and to lower their property tax bills.\u201d\nThe Texas plan mirrors efforts in other GOP-led states such as Iowa, Florida and Georgia to cut property taxes amid rising home values. Those states pursued similar strategies, while California and Colorado are exploring different approaches to easing the tax burden on homeowners, such as annual increase caps.\nThe\nstate\nhas committed an estimated $51 billion over the next two years to offset those cuts, using surplus funds to reduce school district tax rates and backfill revenue lost to exemptions.\nBut some fiscal analysts warn that tying the changes to the state constitution could limit future flexibility if revenues dip. Unlike temporary rate adjustments, these tax breaks can\u2019t be rolled back without another statewide vote \u2014 meaning lawmakers would need to cut other spending if the budget tightens.\nFor cities and counties, the impact could be even sharper. While the state will cover lost school district revenue, local governments that tax business inventories will have to raise rates or pare down budgets to fill the gap.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s mayoral race is officially over \u2014 and despite\ndire predictions from the industry\n, some residential players are chiming in with a clear consensus: don\u2019t believe the hype.\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani won\nthe city\u2019s top post\non Tuesday, besting Independent candidate, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The 34-year-old Assemblymember from Queens ran on, among other policies, the promise of freezing rents for stabilized housing and raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers.\nLeading up to the election, some real estate players warned that a Mamdani victory could\nspark an outflow\nof high-earning residents over concerns of a potential tax hike and public safety issues arising from his policies.\nBrokers in South Florida and suburban New York markets further sounded the alarm bells in headlines and even in advertisements. Top Miami broker Dina Goldentayer\ntook out a billboard\nin Times Square with the #MoveToMiami.\nBut now that the results are in, brokers in the city are saying the panic is\nlargely overrated\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got three kids in private school, two of whom are going through applications. Everyone\u2019s leaving? I wish. Not everyone\u2019s leaving,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen. \u201cFew people will leave a place they call home because of a new mayor. The people who are leaving were probably going anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more nonsense\nfrom Florida brokers\n,\u201d said Serhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha.\nSerhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff argued that homeowners in the city will weigh other factors like their cheap debt over concerns about a Mamdani mayoralty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have people coming to me saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m ready to list,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we\u2019re still in a period where people are locked into their 2 percent rates that they got in Covid.\u201d\nAnd those wealthy enough to not have to factor in financing costs are likely already spending more than half their time outside the city, according to Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg.\n\u201cChances are [the billionaire class] domiciled elsewhere,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t domicile elsewhere, they probably have trusts and all sorts of federal laws that they use to minimize their exposure from a taxation perspective.\u201d\nSteinberg added that his clients are most concerned about public safety, a hot talking point in the run-up to the election. Democratic socialist Mamdani was criticized for previous calls to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d but has apologized for the statement. However, Mamdani\u2019s opponents claim some of his proposals, such as one calling for social workers to respond to mental health crises instead of police, could be ineffective.\nSteinberg encouraged those fearful of a spike in crime to consider the numbers before spreading concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t come to New York. Everyone is being pushed in front of the subway and dying,\u2019\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018have you looked at the data?\u2019\u201d\nWhile some point to Mamdani\u2019s tax-the-rich proposals as potential deterrents for the luxury market, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Frances Katzen said high-net-worth buyers don\u2019t seem to be too concerned about their impact just yet.\n\u201cIf these guys are taking the biggest hit, why are they buying?\u201d she said.\nKatzen pointed to what she called \u201csome of the most stratospheric trades\u201d since Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, including a buyer\nsigning a contract\nto purchase a penthouse at 140 Jane Street, asking $88 million.\n\u201cThe fact pattern doesn\u2019t fit the narrative,\u201d she said.\nThough agents jumped to minimize the doomsday scenario laid out in earlier headlines, they also emphasized that the results weren\u2019t the outcome most in the industry had hoped for.\nStarr Associates\u2019 Shaun Pappas, an attorney who works with developers and buyers, said his clients are adopting a \u201cwait-and-see approach.\u201d\n\u201cThe rhetoric back and forth has just become so extreme on both sides, it\u2019s difficult to ascertain what the actual vision is,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThings have been walked back so much on the mayor-elect side,\u201d he added, pointing to\nMamdani\u2019s about-face\non certain topics, such as his attitude toward working with private developers.\nBlowback will likely only be limited to those already in a tough spot, Kantha said, such as developers trying to raise capital for a project in a less desirable location.\n\u201cPrime products in prime locations are still going to sell,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s thinking, \u2018Oh wow,\nnow the Flatiron is doomed\n.\u2019\u201d\nThe uncertainty about the Mamdani administration will likely make its way into negotiations, Kantha added, with some buyers attempting to pressure sellers into agreeing to offers before the new mayor takes office or has time to start making significant changes.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, you\u2019ll hear anecdotes about people negotiating over Mamdani fears,\u201d Kantha said. \u201cBut if I could tell sellers one thing, it\u2019s don\u2019t capitulate to that,\u201d he added, citing other economic factors such as lower than expected inflation, a booming stock market and falling interest rates as signs that the macro economy is stronger than mayoral concerns.\nDespite their misgivings, some in the industry remain optimistic.\n\u201cI want to give the guy a chance,\u201d said BHS CEO Bess Freedman. \u201cHe wants to achieve great things and make people\u2019s lives better, and I respect that.\u201d\nAs election results started rolling in on Tuesday night, Freedman said that her phone was \u201cnonstop blowing up\u201d with \u201ca lot of \u2018U\u2019 \u2018G\u2019 \u2018H\u2019\u201d and \u201cGod help us.\u201d\nHowever, she added, only time will tell whether some of the industry\u2019s most catastrophic predictions would come true.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can make a decision without him performing yet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to fight with the army you get, not the one you want. If he\u2019s horrible and terrible, we\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sam Nazarian sees Miami as a city at the highest echelons of real estate, largely due to the in-migration of recent years. But growing pains linger.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go backwards. Miami now is one of the most important, if not the most important, cities in the world today, but there are different things that drive this,\u201d said hospitality mogul Nazarian, founder of sbe, whose other holdings include C3 restaurant group.\nNazarian\nspoke with\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Editor in Chief Stuart Elliott at\nTRD\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Wednesday, marking the first panel that kicked off the two-day event at Mana Wynwood. The event followed Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win in New York on Tuesday.\nGenerally, Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized buildings and increase corporate and income taxes, plus his anti-Israel stance, are expected to prompt another influx of New Yorkers to Miami. Yet, Nazarian \u2013\u2013 who said he disagrees with Mamdani\u2019s philosophy and politics, but found that his campaign \u201chit a chord for the next generation\u201d \u2013\u2013 pointed out other factors that drive people\u2019s decisions to leave home and move.\nMiami\u2019s infrastructure may not be ready for another growth spurt, he said, citing long-present issues such as traffic and the lack of private schools. The city also is experiencing new restaurant openings, which also \u201cis not easy to scale so quickly,\u201d including to train staff.\nNazarian isn\u2019t worried about New York developers coming in and posing competition for Miami\u2019s long-established names in real estate, including Terra and Related Group. Building in the Magic City isn\u2019t easy, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to understand the politics of infrastructure \u2026 permitting, zoning inspections, contractors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart to be building down here\u201d in South Florida.\nMiami\u2019s Tuesday mayoral election is headed to a runoff, and Nazarian praised outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, adding he\u2019s part of a crop of South Florida politicians who \u201cgive you the optimism to get shit done.\u201d\nRegardless of whether Mamdani\u2019s win prompts a few more billionaires to move south, \u201cthe biggest buyer in South Florida is the Hispanic and Latino market,\u201d he said.\nNazarian\u2019s career has spanned all facets of the industry. In the 1990s, Nazarian started out as a nightlife king in Los Angeles, where he opened his first club at 26, and at one point had 13 nightclubs. As founder of sbe, a hotel and restaurant group based in Beverly Hills, California, Nazarian at one point controlled preeminent brands including Mondrian, Delano, Hyde. He also launched\nSLS Hotels\n, opening SLS hotels in Beverly Hills, Miami and Las Vegas.\nNazarian sold his stake in the hotel side of the business in 2020 for\n$850 million\nto French firm Accor and at the same time increased his ownership in sbe\u2019s ghost kitchens and C3, owner of Umami Burger.\nAside from restaurants, his most recent ventures are in \u201cwellness and longevity,\u201d as the 50-year-old praised the use of preventative medicine, saying it saved him from a potential brain aneurysm.\nIn Miami, Nazarian\u2019s HQ Hotels &amp; Residences by sbe will brand Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group\u2019s planned\n35-story, 229-unit condo\nproject at 422 Northeast 29th Street in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Marc Anthony, whose house in LA Nazarian once bought, is a partner in HQ brands.\n\u201cI always knew why I got into nightclubs and restaurants: To have the credibility to operate a lifestyle hotel,\u201d said Nazarian, who launched SLS Hotels in the early 2000s, opening SLS-branded hotels in Beverly Hills, Miami and Las Vegas. \u201cIf you are going to be a lifestyle guy, you need to understand the parts that make up the lifestyle. You have to be great at everything.\u201d",

        "content": "Dezer Development landed a $630 million construction loan for the oceanfront Bentley Residences condo project in Sunny Isles Beach, marking the largest financing in South Florida so far this year.\nNew York-based Madison Realty Capital, led by managing principals Brian Shatz, Josh Zegen and Adam Tantleff, is the lender, according to a press release. Berkadia\u2019s Scott Wadler and Alec Fox arranged the financing.\nDezer launched sales of the planned 61-story, 216-unit tower at 18401 Collins Avenue in 2022. The project is more than 50 percent presold, according to the release. Remaining units start at $5.8 million and the two penthouses are asking $37.5 million each.\nSieger Suarez Architects is designing the Bentley Motors-branded tower. Foundation work is nearly completed, and the building is expected to be completed in 2028.\nBentley Residences will be the second luxury condo tower that Dezer builds with his patented Dezervator car elevator, following the completion of Porsche Design Tower in 2019. Bentley will feature amenities totaling 20,000 square feet with a whiskey bar, cigar lounge, home theater, wellness spa, oceanfront pool deck and a private restaurant by chef Todd English. Each condo will have a three- or four-car garage with charging stations for electric vehicles.\nIn 2022, Dezer secured a\n$40 million predevelopment loan\nfor the planned 749-foot tower from City National Bank of Florida.\nA Dezer affiliate bought the 3.6 acre property, which included a five-story Wyndham-branded hotel, for $6.8 million in 1996, records show. It has been torn down.\nThe latest loan marks a major milestone for the development, and adds to a stream of large construction loans to close in recent weeks across South Florida, despite a challenging debt environment.\nYtech this week secured a\n$565 million construction loan\nfor its 70-story, 195-unit luxury condo tower, The Residences at 1428 Brickell. J.P. Morgan is the senior lender.\nAlso this week, Namdar Group\nsecured $460 million\nin bridge and construction loans from Slate Property Group\u2019s Scale Lending for a nearly 1,400-unit, two-tower apartment project in downtown Miami. Both financing packages were announced this week.\nIn June, billionaire Related Ross Chairman and CEO Steve Ross\nsecured $600 million in financing\nfor his planned South Flagler House condo project in West Palm Beach. Bank OZK is the senior lender.\n",

        "content": "One of San Francisco\u2019s most prominent developers has been tasked with reimagining\nMacy\u2019s Union Square flagship\n.\nMacy\u2019s, Incorporated, which also owns Bloomingdale\u2019s, formed a joint venture with\nTMG Partners\n, headed by veteran developer Michael Covarrubias, to explore a redevelopment of the retailer\u2019s 600,000-square-foot store at 170 O\u2019Farrell Street, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Macy\u2019s\nannounced the closure\nof the store last year, but it has remained open as a buyer of the site has yet to emerge.\nAs part of the venture, TMG will work with Macy\u2019s to study potential new uses for the property, including adaptive reuse and upgrades that would cater to downtown\u2019s workers, residents and visitors.\nThe discussions are still in their early stages, and no closing date for the store has been set.\nThe partnership with TMG is \u201cpart of Macy\u2019s ongoing strategy to evaluate compelling options for its real estate portfolio,\u201d Macy\u2019s said in a statement. Details on potential plans and next steps for the Union Square site are forthcoming, according to the Chronicle.\n\u201cWe are wildly excited,\u201d Covarrubias, a developer with four decades of real estate experience, said about the deal. He noted that his team sees great potential \u201cfor that building, in that place, at this time,\u201d though Macy\u2019s and TMG are still figuring out the \u201cright choice of uses\u201d for the property.\n\u201cThere are a lot of creative things that we have been thinking about,\u201d Covarrubias said, adding, \u201cHousing is important for downtown.\u201d Also, TMG could take advantage of the site\u2019s current zoning and proceed with commercial uses like offices, laboratories and institutional space, retail, light industrial, arts and entertainment.\nUnion Square has seen several stores close their doors since the pandemic, but the area could be in the midst of a comeback. Uniqlo, which vacated a large space there during the pandemic, is\nmoving back into a new spot\nnearby. Zara is\ngearing up to open a new flagship\ndown the street from its previously closed location.\nTMG\u2019s efforts with the Macy\u2019s complex aren\u2019t TMG\u2019s only project aiming to breathe new life into downtown. The developer is in the process of\nbuying the Metreon mall\n, and in September, the San Francisco-based firm purchased a historic office building at\n149 New Montgomery St\nreet that it plans to revamp for tech and artificial intelligence tenants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s an appeals board, not a magic wand.\nThe\nbig news\nTuesday was that Zohran Mamdani will be New York City\u2019s next mayor.\nThe other big news was that member deference, the tradition of the City Council voting based on the opinion of the local member on land use issues, is dead.\nExcept, it isn\u2019t\ncompletely\ndead.\nVoters approved three ballot measures that weaken the City Council\u2019s hold on certain housing project approvals.\nOne of the proposals creates housing fast-track options that bypass City Council approval. Another creates a condensed review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing projects that does the same. Those proposals straightforwardly free projects from member deference, at least more so than the third.\nThe third proposal creates a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and appropriate borough president, that can reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of a project that would result in affordable housing.\nThe appeals board could mean some developers will pursue projects in districts that they otherwise would have avoided due to opposition from the local council member. But success in those districts would rely on winning over two out of three of the people on the appeals board. The three members of the appeals board most likely aren\u2019t going to rubber-stamp projects \u2014\u00a0not if they want to have a good relationship with individual members, not to mention the Council at large.\nPerhaps some City Council members will be given more deference by the appeals board than others. But with this dynamic, it seems like it is in the best interest of the developer and local Council member to reach an agreement rather than bring the appeals board into the fray.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think two of the three parties on the appeals board are going to make these decisions lightly,\u201d Rachel Fee, president of the New York Housing Conference, told me recently.\nWe won\u2019t know for sure until these changes are implemented. Developer Bruce Teitelbaum cautioned today that these changes aren\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet.\u201d\nKeep an eye out for more coverage on these ballot measures this week!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I still want to hear from you about the election! Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nVornado Realty Trust is in talks with prospective tenants to anchor its tower that is planned for the former Hotel Pennsylvania site, known as Penn 15,\nmy colleague Elizabeth Cryan reports\n. Perhaps one of the tenants will take the plunge if Vornado rebrands the tower (including, or exclusively, its name)?\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday announced who will lead his transition team. Grace Bonilla, president and CEO of United Way of New York City; Melanie Hartzog, president and CEO of the nonprofit New York Foundling; Lina Khan, former Federal Trade Commission chair; and Maria Torres-Springer, former First Deputy Mayor, will serve as transition co-chairs.\u00a0 Elana Leopold, a political strategist, will serve as executive director of the transition team.\n\u2014\nDemocratic candidate Shirley Aldebol ousted Republican incumbent Council member Kristy Marmorato, who represents Throgs Neck, Pelham Bay, Morris Park and City Island in the Bronx\n,\nGothamist reports\n. Marmorato was the sole Republican Council member in the Bronx.\n\u2014\nICYMI, New Jersey\nelected\nDemocratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill as its next governor.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 6,200-square-foot, single-family home at 48 East 81st Street on the Upper East Side. Sarah Williams and Peter Stack of Societe Real Estate\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$17.1 million\nfor three properties in Kingsbridge. They include 5760-5790 Broadway and 3632 Kingsbridge Avenue, which is across the street. Fedricson Equities sold the properties to an LLC tied to Leonid Yevdayev.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.9 million\nfor a nine-room co-op unit at 19 East 72nd Street in Lenox Hill. Serena Boardman with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 45,195-square-foot, 54-unit project at 913 Pierce Avenue in Morris Park. Victor Han filed the permit on behalf of Vlash Parubi.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "For some in the real estate industry, their worst fears became a reality Tuesday night.\nA Democratic socialist is heading to Gracie Mansion.\nIn his victory speech, Zohran Mamdani said he would go after bad landlords, describing them as proteges of President Donald Trump. He doubled down on his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants, and alluded to his plans to raise taxes for the state\u2019s wealthiest.\n\u201cWe will hold bad landlords to account because the Donald Trumps of our city have grown far too comfortable taking advantage of their tenants,\u201d he said Tuesday night to a crowd at the Brooklyn Paramount. \u201cWe will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax rates.\u201d\nReal estate professionals donated millions to promote Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. But now, in the aftermath of the latter\u2019s victory, some are focused \u2014\u00a0at least publicly \u2014 on areas where they agree with the young mayor-elect. That includes increasing the city\u2019s housing supply.\n\u201cIt would be foolish to reject everything carte blanche,\u201d said Jason Haber, a broker with Compass who helped lead fundraising for a political action committee that supported Cuomo and opposed Mamdani.\nIndustry players who spoke to\nThe Real Deal\nrepeatedly acknowledged that Mamdani\u2019s emphasis on affordability resonated with New Yorkers.\n\u201cHe perfectly diagnosed the problem, but it\u2019s the prescription that we in the industry disagree with,\u201d Haber said, pointing to Mamdani\u2019s proposals to freeze rents and raise corporate taxes.\nHe added, \u201cThe fight goes on for what we believe in, what we think is right for the city.\u201d\nThat fight could play out next year.\n\u201cI think the governors\u2019 race just became the most important race in this city,\u201d said Bob Knakal, CEO of BK Real Estate Advisors.\nTo pay for his ambitious agenda, Mamdani has proposed raising taxes on those earning more than $1 million and increasing the corporate tax rate, both of which will require state action. Gov. Kathy Hochul has resisted tax increases, even as Democratic leaders in the state legislature repeatedly proposed hikes.\nCea Weaver, director of the New York State Tenant Bloc, indicated that her organization is already looking ahead to next year\u2019s races.\n\u201cWe know landlords and developers will throw everything they have to stop us. They can go ahead and try,\u201d Weaver said in a statement. \u201cWe are ready to freeze the rent with the mayor-elect and continue this momentum into next year\u2019s statewide races.\u201d\nLeaders of the group Small Property Owners of New York, or SPONY, said they are determined to make Mamdani realize that \u201csmall property owners are his partners in affordable housing.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Ann Korchak, SPONY board president, and Lincoln Eccles, board vice president, said a rent freeze would be \u201caffordable housing Armageddon for tenants and owners.\u201d\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want his legacy to be the collapse of affordable housing, the mayor-elect must allow the Rent Guidelines Board to set rent adjustments based on the RGB\u2019s own data, and provide small owners with the resources needed to operate their buildings and provide quality affordable housing to New Yorkers,\u201d they said.\nMamdani has said that he is committed to property tax reform and pursuing other forms of relief for property owners, including insurance alternatives.\nDavid Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, said that when he and other affordable housing developers met with Mamdani, he assured them he was not running to punish landlords.\n\u201cWhen it was fairly clear that he was leading in the polls, I and many others took a fresh look at him and realized there was such an overreaction to him, especially in real estate circles,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our conversations with him, he struck me as somebody that was going to be practical.\u201d\nPart of that perception was looking at Mamdani\u2019s current presence rather than \u201cfive-year-old tweets,\u201d Kramer said, referring to unearthed social media posts made by Mamdani, including some that were critical of the NYPD.\nKramer also said he was heartened by Mamdani naming former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to his transition team, believing it to be a sign he will surround himself with experienced people.\n\u201cThat sends a huge statement to those people who are fretting,\u201d he said. \u201cHis top priority is going to be civic excellence.\u201d\nAnother developer, who asked to remain anonymous, was less enthused by her appointment, saying \u201cde Blasio 2.0 isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\nAurora Capital Partners\u2019 Jared Epstein, who helped raise money for Andrew Cuomo, said he will always do whatever he can to contribute to New York\u2019s success.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t exclude trying to find some common ground to work with Mamdani,\u201d he said.\nHe said Tuesday\u2019s results show that voters \u201cdemanded affordability and inclusion,\u201d not that they want to \u201cstall construction or to defund the police.\u201d (Mamdani has said that he doesn\u2019t plan to defund the police in response to questions about a\n2020 social media post\nthat showed support for defunding the police.)\n\u201cThe city cannot produce housing at scale without predictable rules and safe streets,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cPublic safety isn\u2019t an ideological luxury; it\u2019s the precondition for investment, retail vitality and neighborhood stability.\u201d\nHe said the next administration should be judged on \u201cunits delivered and certificates of occupancy.\u201d Housing production, he went on, will rely on amending the property tax break 485x and \u201cdisciplined\u201d timelines for the city\u2019s land use review process.\nDeveloper Bruce Teitelbaum agreed that, absent changes to 485x, Mamdani will have a difficult time delivering on his plan to build 200,000 housing units.\n\u201cWe need to build more housing of all categories quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat premise transcends ideology and theory.\u201d\nTeitelbaum is preparing to start construction on his residential project known as\nOne45\n, where the addition of city subsidies could increase affordability levels under an agreement the developer made with Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine. He said Mamdani\u2019s focus on economic development and creating more affordable housing is \u201cmusic to my ears,\u201d but that the new mayor should meet one-on-one with developers and lenders.\n\u201cHe, as chief executive of the city, is going to have to personally get into the weeds,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to grab the reins.\u201d\n",

The firm inked a 125,000-square-foot, 10-year sublease on the 25th and 26th floors of the recently redeveloped Penn District tower. Robinhood is leasing the space from Madison Square Garden, a source said. The lease was first reported in CBRE\u2019s October Manhattan office report.\nIt\u2019s the third deal to surface this week at the 31-story Penn District tower, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza, which recently underwent a $750 million renovation aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants. The redevelopment is part of Vornado\u2019s big bet on the Penn District, where the company has sunk $1.2 billion into revamping Penn 1 and Penn 2, along with ambitious plans to makeover the neighborhood\u2019s retail.\nChairman and CEO Steven Roth declared yesterday in an earnings call\nearlier this week\nthat \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the tipping point for the Penn District \u2014 our three-block-long city-within-a-city, is now behind us.\u201d\nThe Robinhood deal was the largest of the month in Midtown, where leasing activity totaled 1.6 million square feet, per CBRE. Year-to-date leasing activity reached 15.9 million square feet in the submarket, up 23 percent year over year. The report cited another deal at Penn 2 with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, but a source said it has not been finalized.\nA spokesperson for Robinhood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. In the last week alone,\nFintech firm Current\nsigned a lease for a little over 62,000 square feet and\ncommunications and consulting firm FGS Glocal\nsigned an 80,000-square-foot lease at the 1.8 million-square-foot tower. Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nlast summer with plans to move its headquarters to the building.\nOther tenants at the tower include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n",

The pipeline is oversaturated, and demand for units at the higher end is softening, they said. But their message to the brokers in the audience was simple and clear: \u201cWe want to pay you.\u201d\n\u201cWe love paying commissions because that means we have sales,\u201d Maloney said. And sales are top priority in a highly competitive market.\n\u201cA lot of the projects you see aren\u2019t going to get built, they priced themselves too low and costs went up,\u201d said Maloney, whose current pipeline includes the planned\nsupertall Waldorf Astoria Residences Miami\nand\nE11even Club Residences Beyond\n. Construction costs have surged in recent years, but Maloney said the market slowdown has started to bring them back down to earth.\nBranding plays a crucial role in the marketplace, if chosen well.\n\u201cA brand helps us sell because we don\u2019t have to explain [what we\u2019re selling],\u201d Rosso said, whose planned projects include\nthe Standard Residences, Midtown Miami\n. But he cautioned against running rampant with just any brand.\nHe pointed to magazine and car brands \u2013\u2013 Vertical Developments and Urban Network Capital Group are planning an\nElle-branded tower in Edgewater\nand Michael Stern is planning a\nMercedes-Benz tower in Brickell\n\u2013\u2013 as stretching the relationship between brands and buildings. \u201cYou have to be careful not to exaggerate the concept of branding.\u201d\nMomentum is crucial in a packed new development pipeline, the developers said. The longer a project takes, the greater the risk to profit margins. Maloney said his first\nE11even-branded tower\nsold through 400 units in 90 days, but still barely broke even because construction costs rose so rapidly.\n\u201cOur biggest, biggest, biggest enemy is time,\u201d said Rosso. \u201cTime for us is uncertainty.\u201d\nIncluded in uncertainty are affordability and social infrastructure challenges facing a growing Miami. Eichner, whose pipeline includes\nLa Baia North and South\nin Bay Harbor Islands, raised concerns about the dislocation of Miami\u2019s working class.\n\u201cPeople are being forced out of Miami-Dade County who are regular everyday workers,\u201d said Eichner. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out workforce housing and the government has to play a role in this.\u201d\nRosso also raised the issue of private school shortages and stricter immigration policies restricting how many people are able to relocate to the Miami market and hampering its growth. The perception that Miami is open for business and open to all is critical for the region\u2019s continued flourishing.\n\u201cWe cannot allow [that perception] to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that is our business.\u201d",

A 78-unit motel in Long Beach also bought with Homekey funds recently reopened as a homeless shelter at a per-unit cost of about $294,000.\nWork was slated to begin with demolition on Nov. 2.\nOn the docket for the Ramada site is a conversion of \u201ctransient guest rooms into light housekeeping rooms\u201d with a change \u201cin interior layout, new laundry rooms, storage rooms, and a patio\u201d with \u201c\naffordability per [Executive Directive 1]\n,\u201d records at the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety cited by the Current said. The most recent permit issued for the project was for the installation of a fire alarm system.\nAs part of ED1 compliance, the project must consist entirely of affordable housing. A timeline for completion has not been disclosed.\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 ED1, which expedites fully affordable residential developments, was created almost three years ago. It has resulted in 29,000 approvals for fully affordable multifamily developments this year, compared to fewer than 18,000 approvals for market-rate multifamily housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "The Housing Authority of Cook County has climbed out of federal oversight, but its internal struggles are far from over.\nThe nation\u2019s 14th-largest public housing authority, which serves more than 30,000 residents across suburban\nCook County\n, was removed from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s \u201ctroubled\u201d list last month after two years of poor audit performance and mismanagement, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. Yet documents and interviews show that the agency, now led by Executive Director\nDanita Childers\n, is grappling with bitter infighting, high staff turnover and confusion over a secretive reorganization effort.\nRecords obtained by the outlet show payments exceeding $26,000 to attorney Charles Krugel for \u201creorganization\u201d work \u2014 despite Childers\u2019 public denials that a staff overhaul was underway. Board materials list 37 \u201cnew and restructured\u201d positions, and invoices reference both restructuring and an investigation into a board member. \u201cWe asked and were told there wouldn\u2019t be any reorg,\u201d board chair Wendy Walker Williams said during a heated September meeting. \u201cThis appears to us as though there has been one.\u201d\nChilders maintains that day-to-day staffing decisions fall under her purview, arguing the board\u2019s role is limited to governance, not operations. But board members contend that executive-level hires affect the agency\u2019s strategic direction and require oversight. The clash has fueled distrust between leadership and staff, with some employees describing a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment and others accusing\nChilders\nof favoritism and retaliation.\nSince January, 16 employees \u2014 nearly 9 percent of the 180-person workforce \u2014 have quit, while 14 others have been terminated. Those departures come despite a new union contract signed in March aimed at improving wages and workloads. Morale remains low, with long-serving employees saying instability is undermining services for residents and voucher holders.\nMeanwhile, the agency faces scrutiny over $641,000 in outside contracts approved under Childers, including ethics, legal and consulting work. The board\u2019s investigation of Commissioner Eric Slaughter \u2014 who has been accused of \u201cunintentional sexual harassment\u201d following internal complaints \u2014 further exposed divisions within the agency. Slaughter denies wrongdoing and says he was punished for asking hard questions about spending.\nCounty\nBoard President\nToni Preckwinkle\n, who appoints housing authority commissioners, urged transparency but declined to intervene directly.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The city found \u201cextensive violations\u201d after community complaints in May.\nNamdar also got into a fracas with Chicago suburb\nCalumet City\nthis year, after the city tried to use eminent domain to take control of a mall redevelopment.\nBrookfield marketed Southland Mall as having long-term fundamentals, citing strong freeway visibility and little competition in the area.\nBesides that property, in the Bay Area, Namdar also owns the West Valley Mall in Tracy.\nHalfway across the country, last month, Namdar picked up another distressed retail property: the 170,000-square-foot retail space at\n1 North State Street in Chicago\n. The firm paid $8.3 million, or $49 per square foot, for the retail portion of the office building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Shares jumped more than 4 percent after the new proposal, closing at $13.11 on Monday.\nMCB, which already owns about 9.2 percent of Whitestone\u2019s stock, said it has secured a letter from Wells Fargo expressing confidence it can raise up to $950 million in debt to fund the acquisition. The Baltimore firm, led by co-founder and managing partner David Bramble, signaled that patience is running out.\n\u201cAbsent constructive engagement toward a transaction or the initiation of a public strategic alternatives process, we intend at a minimum to vote against the entire Whitestone Board at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders,\u201d Bramble wrote, calling on other investors to do the same.\nWhitestone has not commented on the latest offer. The REIT owns 55 open-air shopping centers in Texas and Arizona, with a portfolio exceeding $1 billion in value, including Houston\u2019s upscale\nBlvd Place\nnear the Galleria.\nMCB has accused Whitestone of\nchronic underperformance\nand weak governance, pointing to negative total returns since its first bid last summer.\nWhitestone reported better-than-expected third-quarter results \u2014 26 cents in core funds from operations per share and $41 million in revenue \u2014 but its stock has still fallen more than 10 percent year-to-date.\nIf Whitestone again rejects the offer, MCB could escalate to a proxy battle next year. The window for nominating board candidates opens Dec. 5 and runs through Jan. 4. It would mark the third activist challenge Whitestone has faced in as many years, after staving off\nEzra Asset Management in 2024\nand another dissident investor the year before.\nWhitestone\u2019s top shareholders \u2014 BlackRock with 15.2 percent and Vanguard with 10.9 percent \u2014 have not publicly weighed in.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "IBM is fast-tracking its Austin office relocation.\nThe tech stalwart said it will move into its space at Domain 12, a 320,000-square-foot office tower owned by Cousins Properties, next year \u2014 about a year earlier than previously expected, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe firm said its investment in the facility would build on the partner and client ecosystem it has established in Austin for more than 55 years.\nThe accelerated timeline marks a shift from what Brandywine Realty Trust CEO Jerry Sweeney\noutlined\njust weeks earlier.\nOn an Oct. 23 earnings call, Sweeney told analysts IBM would vacate its offices at Uptown ATX in 2027. Instead, IBM now plans to occupy the full Domain 12 building at\n11800 Alterra Parkway\nby next summer, according to recent filings. Domain 12 stands 17 stories and was delivered in 2020.\nIBM took over the tower last year after assuming Meta\u2019s full-building lease.\nThe building\u2019s tenant improvement work \u2014 estimated at $40 million \u2014 is set to begin Nov. 10 and wrap by July 1, 2026, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The renovation will modernize all 320,000 square feet of space, though those details are preliminary.\nIBM\u2019s move caps a long search for a new Austin home that began in 2022. The company initially pre-leased a 320,000-square-foot office from Houston-based Hines in a to-be-built\nDomain project\n, but that deal fell through when the development failed to advance. Hines later secured rezoning for the site to pursue a mixed-use plan instead.\nIBM\u2019s shift to Domain 12 underscores its commitment to Austin as a key U.S. hub, even as the company trims office space in\nother markets\n. The new digs position IBM closer to major enterprise tenants and the city\u2019s tech corridor, where companies like Amazon, Indeed and Vrbo have anchored expansions in recent years.\nIBM still holds a 490,000-square-foot lease at 11400 Burnet Road, a Stonelake Capital Partners property also within The Domain, giving it one of the largest corporate presences in the district.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "I bet Zohran Mamdani loves the new upgrades to Grand Central Terminal.\nThe\nmayor-elect\nshould ask himself: Would they have happened if we treated transit stations like he does rent-stabilized apartments?\nThe MTA just finished a\n$700 million overhaul\nof Grand Central, giving the terminal 30 new turnstiles, 38 new or wider staircases and a wider mezzanine outside the entrance for the 4, 5, 6 and 7 trains. It also replaced 10 escalators and 10 elevators.\nNo such overhaul has happened to a rent-stabilized property since the Mamdani-backed Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019\ncapped rent increases\nto pay for major capital improvements at 2 percent and at $83 a month for individual apartment improvements.\nMeanwhile, the MTA snagged $15 billion from congestion pricing, which it is using to fund renovations across the transit system. Attention, socialists: Stuff costs money. More than taxing the rich would yield.\nSome landlords think the state legislature is following socialists\u2019 plan to take over their properties by starving them of revenue. As it happens, that is exactly what the government did to the city\u2019s subways, following a long period of deterioration.\nBy limiting the fare to 5 cents, it forced the subways\u2019 private operators to defer maintenance \u2014 rendering service horribly unreliable \u2014 and to eventually go bust. The public takeover was completed in 1940.\nThe government then did what it wouldn\u2019t allow the private subway companies to do: It doubled the fare to a dime in 1948 \u2014 the first increase since 1904.\nThe parallels with rent stabilization are almost eerie. To recap:\nThe government capped private subways\u2019 revenue, forcing their decline, bankruptcy and government takeover. The HSTPA, Rent Guidelines Board (which reduced rents for 10 consecutive years relative to inflation) and Mamdani\u2019s promised four-year rent freeze are doing the same for fully rent-stabilized buildings.\nTo be sure, a sweeping public seizure of buildings is not imminent. They have thousands of owners, not just a handful as the subways did, and every building\u2019s financial distress is different. They would go down one at a time, not all at once, if nothing is done.\nIt\u2019s likely that something will be done. We just don\u2019t know when and by whom. Even Mamdani might do something.\nHe won\u2019t back down from freezing the rent (upon taking control of the Rent Guidelines Board in 2028), but he could pull other levers that help owners. He could ask the state to\nreduce property taxes\nand to allow landlords to keep the full value of rental vouchers. He could provide low-interest loans for renovations of vacant units.\n\u201cThe campaign has ended,\u201d\ntweeted\nJay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, \u201cbut the battle to save New York\u2019s regulated housing from being squeezed to death is just beginning.\u201d\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s office market experienced an uptick in investment sales over the past year, marking a comeback after a slowdown. Yet, distress and discounted deals are lingering, as elevated interest rates and other economic headwinds remain.\nDeal volume reached nearly $2.2 billion in the tri-county region in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, marking a 28 percent increase from the same period last year, according to data from CBRE. It also is a nearly 100 percent boost from the $1.1 billion sales volume during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2023, when investment sales hit their lowest point in the past five years, the data shows.\nDeal volume is nowhere near the apex it reached during South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era market boom when out-of-state companies leased big blocks of space, prompting record rents and an investment sales bonanza. In the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2021, $3.9 billion in deals closed, according to CBRE.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely gotten better than it was two years ago. It will come back like a Phoenix,\u201d said broker C. Todd Everett of Lee &amp; Associates. There\u2019s \u201cstarting to be an appetite for office.\u201d\nFinancing, which dried up during the climate of higher interest rates in recent years, is slowly coming back. Commercial mortgage-backed securities and debt funds are back into office lending. Life insurance companies and pension funds are slowly coming back, and banks remain the most skittish office lender, experts said.\n\u201cThe big banks are willing to selectively do high-quality office properties, and the local and regional banks are now making some office loans, and it\u2019s very borrower specific,\u201d said Chris Lee of CBRE. \u201cThey might want to see deposits increased by the borrower, and some recourse worked in.\u201d\nLoan spreads, or the lenders\u2019 profit margins, have decreased, and loan-to-value ratios have only slightly budged, Lee said.\nThis year, several all-cash deals were recorded.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, known for buying all cash, paid\n$274.4 million\nlast month for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami. Generally, cash buyers are able to negotiate a better price because sellers prefer to avoid the uncertainty of financing.\nTroubles persist\nDistress still appeared in South Florida. R&amp;B Realty parted with its Gateway at Wynwood building, which the firm completed in 2021 and this year lost in foreclosure.\nYet, others were able to stave off losing their buildings in foreclosure auctions. Chris Neilson, court-appointed receiver overseeing Coral Gables\u2019 Columbus Center, sold it in March for\n$76 million\n, after previous owner Affinius Capital was hit with a foreclosure suit over an allegedly delinquent $71.6 million loan.\nOrlando-based Foundry Commercial sold the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\nin January, marking a 36.4 percent discount from its 2018 price.\nIn May, Boston-based Rockpoint, Miami-based Tricera, Palm Beach-based NDT Development and Boston-based New England Development sold the 18-story One Clearlake tower at 250 South Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n. That\u2019s nearly 26 percent less than their purchase price four years ago.\nLandlords selling at a discount and even those just breaking even likely are trying to wiggle out of debt woes.\n\u201cThe trades you are seeing in the market are largely due to debt maturities,\u201d said broker Douglas K. Mandel of Marcus &amp; Millichap. \u201cIf you put floating-rate debt on loans [issued] in 2022, I think you are in a bad situation. \u2026 They are kind of forced to make a decision, whether they put new equity into a deal, or they sell it.\u201d\nBut, he cautioned, a discounted sale \u201cisn\u2019t the end of the world\u201d and doesn\u2019t signify widespread distress. The current climate also allows investors to have more buying power and afford higher tier buildings than they generally would have purchased, Mandel said.\nThat\u2019s why private investors and family offices permeated the buying pool during the slowdown in recent years. Institutional investors, which generally steered clear from office buildings in the past two years, are returning, albeit slowly.\nAfter the Federal Reserve imposed 12 aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, it twice dropped rates by 25 basis points this year. But this isn\u2019t enough to make a difference for landlords with floating-rate debt or seeking to refinance, experts said. The 10-year Treasury yields, which dictate rates on fixed-interest loans, remain higher.\nDue to the higher cost of capital, prices remain somewhat lower, but that pressure is easing, experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to see \u201821 prices soon,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut we are absolutely above \u201823 pricing.\u201d",

        "content": "Houston is turning to\nGod\u2019s backyard\nfor affordable housing development.\nTrinity East Village Senior Apartments, a four-story, 90-unit development for local seniors, will start construction this April on land owned by Trinity East United Methodist Church in Houston\u2019s Third Ward neighborhood, according to a filing with the state.\nThe project is expected to finish in October 2027. All units will be one-bedroom apartments for people older than 62, according to a Houston Housing Authority memo.\nThe NHP Foundation and a local community development corporation, the Trinity East Village CDC, are collaborating on the development.\nConstruction is expected to cost about $33 million, which will be financed via\nlow income housing tax credits\n. The City of Houston is estimated to contribute $4 million of soft financing, and the Houston Housing Authority plans to contribute $2 million.\nIn a trend dubbed Yes in God\u2019s Backyard, or YIGBY, developers have been looking into land owned by\nreligious organizations\n, which are among the biggest landowners in the country.\nCalifornia passed a\nlaw\ntwo years ago that streamlined affordable housing development on land owned by religious organizations and nonprofit colleges,\nunlocking an estimated 171,000 acres\nfor development.\nSimilar proposals were filed in\nthe last Texas legislature\n, but they\ndidn\u2019t progress\n. Opponents such as The Real Estate Council argued that YIGBY projects need affordable unit requirements, which the bill did not include.\nTrinity East Village will primarily serve outgoing residents of Cuney Homes, a 90-year-old public housing complex that the Houston Housing Authority plans to redevelop.\nBuilt in the 1930s, Cuney is Houston\u2019s oldest public housing development. Cuney residents were told earlier this year to prepare to move out, the Houston Chronicle reported. Two-thirds of Trinity East Village\u2019s 90 units will be reserved for them.\nConstruction of an affordable housing project is underway at the site of a former church in\nSouth Dallas\n, and a congregation in\nAustin\nis developing a mixed-use project anchored by a new church.\n",

        "content": "David Tabak appears to have found his next Brooklyn project, one likely to be less complex than the much-watched Brooklyn Yards development.\nTabak acquired the development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus for $58.5 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The 38,500-square-foot site traded for nearly $1,520 per square foot.\nThe seller was the Mazzei family, who has owned the one-story garage on the site since 2005. Demolition permits for the garage have yet to be filed, but it could be nothing more than a matter of time.\nTabak is already looking at a 12-story, 350-unit residential building at the full block between Third Avenue and Nevins Street. The site allows for a 259,000-square-foot development and is zoned for residential and commercial use.\nCritically, the site comes with eligibility for the 421a tax abatement, one of the few large-scale redevelopment sites left with that distinction, according to the deal\u2019s brokers.\nA JLL team including Michael Mazzara, Ethan Stanton and Brendan Maddigan brokered the sale. The outlet could not reach spokespeople for the buyer or seller to comment.\nThe Mazzeis took a shot at developing on the site,\nfiling plans\nin 2022 for a 12-story, 291-unit project. But those plans never materialized.\nTabak and Meyer Lebovits are pursuing what appears to be a more complicated project on the surface in another part of Brooklyn, Borough Park.\nA year ago, the developers\nwon approva\nl for a 14-building, 270-unit project to be built on top of a freight rail line. The ambitious design curves around four city blocks and would be built directly above active tracks where a freight train rumbles through once a day.\nThe project will consist largely of four-story townhomes, along with a few six-story townhomes and a nine-story commercial building at the end. Of the 270 units, 30 percent will be affordable.\nThe project is viewed as a\npotential model\nfor further development opportunities across New York City.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "JC Griffin\u2019s pitch for a gleaming high-rise campus on Chicago\u2019s Near South Side is moving into the city approval stage, but the ink still isn\u2019t dry on the necessary land sale or construction financing for the massive project that also touts an AI workforce training facility and green energy.\nThe former Transwestern broker\u2019s Griffin Venture Group is promoting its 1.4 million-square-foot Metropolis Pointe proposal as a low-carbon, tech-driven \u201cnext-gen lifestyle campus,\u201d yet much about the project remains aspirational.\nStill, the developer has taken a significant step toward city approval by gaining 4th Ward Alderman Lamont Robinson\u2019s support for the project and has hired a legal team with considerable clout.\nGriffin brought on lawyers with Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres including David Reifman, the city\u2019s former Planning Commissioner under Rahm Emanuel, as well as Jesse Dodson. They\u2019re set to meet with city planning officials early next month for some initial feedback on the plan.\nGriffin is under contract to buy the 6.6-acre site at 26th Street and Martin Luther King Drive from King Sykes LLC, a local investor group that once tried to sell the same land to data-center firm Equinix.\nThat\n$30 million deal collapsed and led to a lawsuit\nover city interference in which a former alderman,\nSophia King\n, allegedly tried to steer the sale to\nScott Goodman\u2019s Farpoint Development\n, leader of the Bronzeville Lakefront megaproject next door. A judge later\ndismissed\nKing Sykes\u2019 claims, however.\nNow, Griffin\u2019s firm is pursuing city approvals for a residential tower and mixed-use complex that would sit adjacent to Bronzeville Lakefront, which is progressing, but slowly, on transforming that site formerly anchored by the Michael Reese Hospital.\nThe King Sykes site\u2019s current owners paid $12.4 million for it in 2007 and have held it through years of stalled plans and political friction,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nGriffin\u2019s proposed project \u2014 his firm\u2019s first ground-up development in Chicago \u2014 would mark a dramatic pivot: a 50-story high-rise with more than 600 apartments and condos, plus retail and a \u201csky veranda\u201d at the top.\nThe plan also layers in an Artificial Intelligence Preparedness Institute, billed as a hub for AI research and workforce training, alongside a 185,000-square-foot digital infrastructure facility and a 26,000-square-foot cogeneration electricity plant in partnership with energy operator CenTrio.\nYet there\u2019s still a long path ahead. Financing details haven\u2019t been disclosed, and Griffin has declined to name institutional partners for the AI institute. Even with Bronzeville Lakefront next door, that megaproject has itself experienced a delayed rollout as developers navigate interest rates, infrastructure costs and city politics.\nIf Griffin can close on the site and push entitlements through, Metropolis Pointe could become one of the largest private investments in Bronzeville\u2019s recent history.\nBut without clear financial backing or a finalized land transfer, the initiative risks joining Chicago\u2019s long list of overhyped projects that never broke ground. For now, the \u201ccity\u2019s first next-gen lifestyle campus\u201d is still an idea on paper \u2014 albeit one with a slick pitch deck and a developer betting his reputation on it.\n",

        "content": "Riviera Beach is cashing in on South Florida\u2019s development boom.\nWest Palm Beach\u2019s northern neighbor and home of the Port of Palm Beach has nearly 2,000 condos and apartments in the development pipeline, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. And there\u2019s still more to come \u2013\u2013 the city is courting developers for its 90-acre Marina Village project, a redevelopment effort focused on the city\u2019s waterfront corridor. The Riviera Beach City Council is currently considering proposals from two developers, Bob Sonnenblick\u2019s Los Angeles-based Sonnenblick Development and Peter Baytarian\u2019s North Palm Beach-based Forest Development, both of which include residential components, according to planning documents.\nForest is also competing with West Palm Beach-based Kenco Communities and Washington, D.C.-based Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group\nfor a 2.2-acre city-owned site\nthat could become a development with hundreds of additional residential units.\nHere\u2019s a look at the residential pipeline so far:\nResidences at Marina Village | 57 East 12th Street | Related Group\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Miami-based Related Group is planning an eight-story, 149-unit apartment complex on the 2.4 acre site at 57 East 12th Street in Riviera Beach. The developer won approval for the project in June and landed $100.3 million in construction financing in September. The apartments are slated for households earning between 30 percent and 110 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s area median income, which was $104,000 in 2024.\nGallery at Marina Village | 1300 Broadway | Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners\nAdjacent to the planned Residences at Marina Village is the site for Gallery at Marina Village. Related is partnering with Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group and Tezral Partners, a Riviera Beach-based development firm led by former Riviera Beach CRA director Tony Brown and Ezra Saffold, for the project. The planned 20-story, two-tower project at 1300 Broadway will have 418 apartments, about 3,000 square feet of retail, another 3,000 square feet of offices and a 648-space parking garage.\nMarina Annex | 251 West 11th Street | O\u2019Connor Capital Partners, Urban Farmers, Riviera Beach Housing Authority\nNew York-based O\u2019Connor Capital Partners is planning Marina Annex, a mixed-use apartment project with 175 units, 6,500 square feet of retail and a 15,000-square-foot community center at 251 West 11th Street. The partners bought the 3.6-acre site for $2 million in February. The developers are partnering with the Alpha Phi Alpha Foundation to run the community center, which will be named for the late Edward Rodgers, the first Black circuit court judge of Palm Beach County.\n1117 Broadway | SobelCo\nBoca Raton-based SobelCo, led by Samuel and Jeffrey Sobel, is planning a sprawling mixed-use condo project on a 4.3-acre former boat yard in Riviera Beach. The complex will include two 20-story buildings and two 13-story buildings, totaling 508 condos, 10,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and a parking garage with 1,083 spaces. SobelCo bought the site at 1117 Broadway for $12 million in March. Riviera Beach gave its final approval for the project this week.\nSoleste on the Trail | 7920 North Military Trail | Estate Companies\nSouth Miami-based Estate Companies is planning a four-story, 255-unit apartment complex dubbed Soleste on the Trail at 7920 North Military Trail. Estate, led by Robert Suris and Jeffrey Ardizon, dropped $8 million for the 15.8-acre site in 2021, according to public records. The firm landed a $60 million construction loan from BB Americas Bank for the project in September.\n3700 Broadway | Oculina | Forest Development\nBaytarian is planning a pair of 25-story mixed-use condo towers with 399 units, more than 17,000 square feet of restaurant space, 11,000 square feet of offices, and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail. Oculina, as the project is called, is planned for a 3.4-acre site at 3700 Broadway that was formerly a Winn-Dixie. Baytarian agreed to pay $4.9 million to the city\u2019s affordable housing fund in exchange for increased height and density for the project.",

With that move, the property at 751 North Highland Avenue is hitting the market for just under $7 million, or $1,507 per square foot.\nCarolwood Estates\n\u2019\nKevin Booker\nholds the listing. Booker also worked with Edmonds on finding his Las Vegas studio.\n\u201cKenny is so smart,\u201d Booker said of how Edmonds configured the space. \u201cThat [upper level] area was designed for meditation, or there were certain artists that got in a groove and they didn\u2019t want to leave for three or four days. So, somebody like Michael Jackson could stay there for a few weeks and be comfortable.\u201d\nThe Hollywood property\u2019s upper level bedroom and meditation area also has a full bath.\nThe building spans 4,640 square feet and sits on a nearly 6,000-square-foot lot. It\u2019s minutes from the Ovation Hollywood open-air retail center, Hollywood Walk of Fame and other attractions.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had everyone from Phil Collins to Aretha Franklin to Mariah Carey and En Vogue [record there]. Everybody that shaped the music industry and is still shaping the industry today,\u201d Booker said.\nThe list of artists that have worked in the space is extensive and includes Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Barbra Streisand, Pharrell Williams, Toni Braxton, C\u00e9line Dion, Fall Out Boy, Lionel Richie and Ariana Grande.\nEdmonds has racked up 13 Grammy Awards and 26 number one R&amp;B songs among other accolades during his career.\nBooker, who specializes in working with high-profile clients,\njoined Carolwood last year\n, after nearly a decade at Westside Estate Agency.\n\u201cThe education I got from [Westside Estate Agency co-founder] Kurt Rappaport is equivalent to a Harvard degree,\u201d Booker said, adding that Carolwood \u201cis the future\u201d for the local high end.\nThe agent, who has career sales over $100 million, said business has been steady this year and pointed out that it helps to be part of a brokerage that holds a sizable share of the\nluxury inventory\nlocally.\nIn July, Booker was the listing agent, along with Carolwood\u2019s James Harris and David Parnes, on the $28.5 million sale of\n755 Sarbonne Road\nin Bel-Air.\nErewhon\nCEO Anthony Antoci and President Josephine Antoci sold the 15,000-square-foot residence to entrepreneur Dara Mir, husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lily Ghalichi. That closing price equated to more than $6 million over what the Antocis paid for the property a year prior.\n",

The second you start taking things away from agents, there is no barrier to leave. You can just basically get up, leave and go to another firm, obviously have some clawbacks and all that,\u201d said Liebowitz. \u201cIt\u2019s just the reality of what happens anytime you do a deal. You have to realize you\u2019re going to lose pieces of that deal after it\u2019s done.\u201d\nGal, founder and CEO of the white-label firm Side, jumped in to note that it is \u201cincredibly hard\u201d for a top agent to leave Compass today.\n\u201cWe talk to Compass agents all the time who are looking to explore their options and then realize they really can\u2019t, unless they\u2019re coming out of pocket for a whole lot of money, to a point where we\u2019ve had to set up what I affectionately refer to as the \u2018Compass emancipation fund,\u2019 where we\u2019re advancing agents money at no interest,\u201d Gal said.\nClawbacks\nare necessary, Liebowitz said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put all that energy and effort and dollars into the agents when they come on and not have that ability to do it,\u201d he said.\nGal championed the agent side of the business. Side helps agents create their brokerage brand and provides them with back-end services. But if agents want to exit their deals with Side within two years of joining the company, then they have to pay Side back.\n\u201cI want to remind all the agents in this room \u2026 because you spend the whole career being indoctrinated and institutionalized to believe the complete opposite. But the truth at the end of the day is that you\u2019re the value creator in this industry,\u201d Gal said. \u201cYou wake up every morning, you connect invisible dots. You\u2019re putting up your own time, your own money, your own opportunity, taking all the damn risk, and you are the ones that make it happen. And then you do a favor to all these other companies by slapping their logo on top of your name.\u201d\nLiebowitz, who became president and CEO of Elliman about a year ago, suggested his company\u2019s\n$85 million sale\nof its property management arm to a subsidiary of Associa, one of the largest property management firms in the country, was timed right with\nZohran Mamdani\nwinning the mayoral election in New York.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really being political, but we were in the property management business. It was a big business, and there\u2019s a lot of issues with labor law in New York. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize that with that administration, it\u2019s going to be more difficult,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cSo it was really it kind of wind up between the Anywhere and Compass merger, between what was going on in New York, between getting a really top price. We really want to be a pure-play real estate brokerage firm, asset light.\u201d\nGal and Liebowitz were also critical of the National Association of Realtors\u2019 handling of the class action litigation centered around commission payments and buyer broker agreements.\nGal said the lawsuits \u201care a gift\u201d to the industry.\n\u201cJust a year ago, you had a million agents out there that are averaging three closings a year pitching buyers. It\u2019s free and no obligation, and that\u2019s how they were getting deals done with actual buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that anymore\u2026 and that\u2019s putting a lot of the larger brokerages at risk, because so much of their revenue and their income and their profits depend on those part time agents at very favorable splits to the house.\u201d\nLiebowitz said someone at NAR recently reached out to him to speak.\n\u201cWhy the hell would I waste my time? You know what,\u00a0 I actually said, \u2018I want the agenda before I get on the phone,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI just want my money back from the settlement. We paid off all our debts, and now I would love to have that cash.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A Dallas investor betting on healthcare real estate is swooping into Chicago\u2019s North Side, taking a distressed lab building off\nSterling Bay\u2019s\nhands as the developer\nsheds property\n.\nAltera Fund Advisors is in contract to buy the Lincoln Park Bioscience Center at\n2430 North Halsted Street\nand plans to convert the five-story, 125,000-square-foot building into a multi-tenant medical outpatient facility, Costar\nreported\n.\nThe deal is expected to close later this year, Altera CEO Terry Quinn told the outlet. The deal marked Altera\u2019s second Chicago-area purchase after a property in Oak Lawn.\nThe building\u2019s sellers \u2014 Sterling Bay and partner\nHarrison Street\n\u2014 teamed up with lender Capital One to market the asset last year through CBRE.\nThe sale price is likely far below the property\u2019s $64 million debt, people familiar with the deal told the outlet.\nIt\u2019s another sign of how far the\nonce-hyped life sciences play\nhas fallen. Sterling Bay bought the former Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital site for $24 million in 2018 and poured another $19 million into renovations to launch it as a biotech incubator.\nBut demand for lab space has cooled since the pandemic, leaving the Halsted property 40 percent leased when it hit the market.\nIt also follows a falling out last year between Sterling Bay and one of the building\u2019s major tenants \u2014 Massachusetts-based\nBioLabs\n\u2014 as Sterling Bay sued to evict and asked a Cook County judge to award more than $2.7 million in damages over a dispute regarding the tenant\u2019s lease of 30,000-square-feet of the Halsted building.\nBioLabs operates similarly to\ncoworking\nproviders, by renting large blocks of real estate that it can turn into lab space. It then subleases the space to early-stage companies in need of research equipment and workspace on more flexible and briefer terms than standard office leases. It operates across 17 other locations in the U.S., Europe and Japan according to its website.\nThe slowdown has also hammered Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion\nLincoln Yards\nmegaproject nearby, where Bank OZK recently seized 28 acres and sold them to JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate for $84 million to make way for a new residential district called\nFoundry Park\n.\nQuinn said Altera plans to reposition the Halsted building as a Class A medical office property catering to outpatient users. Quinn added that the structure\u2019s HVAC and electrical systems make it ideal for clinical tenants. O\u2019Donnell Commercial Real Estate will handle leasing, with available blocks ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 square feet.\nThe deal is part of Altera\u2019s strategy of buying healthcare assets at a \u201csubstantial discount to replacement cost.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Stefan Soloviev\u2019s\nlatest North Fork play\nis testing how far the East End\u2019s quieter half can bend before it breaks.\nHe wants to turn 372 acres of farmland straddling Cutchogue and Peconic into nearly 50 luxury homes, the Suffolk Times\nreported\n. The plan has triggered fierce backlash from locals worried the North Fork is going the way of the Hamptons.\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s proposal, called the Colusa Conservation Subdivision, would carve 47 residential lots out of one of the region\u2019s largest remaining farm tracts. Plans call for 18 bluff-top parcels overlooking Long Island Sound and 29 inland lots, while preserving 267 acres of farmland. The project, through Soloviev\u2019s Crossroads Atlantic LLC, could be worth hundreds of millions when built.\nSouthold officials initially called the proposal \u201cencouraging\u201d for its use of the town\u2019s conservation subdivision model, which preserves farmland while allowing limited development. But town planners later flagged major issues.\nIn a letter last month, planning director Heather Lanza wrote the design didn\u2019t conform to Southold\u2019s comprehensive plan, citing concerns that residential spurs would cut through preserved farmland. She called for a \u201cmore compact clustered lot design\u201d and better integration of open space.\nSoloviev, heir to the late real estate titan Sheldon Solow, has become one of the East End\u2019s biggest landowners in recent years, assembling hundreds of acres through his Crossroads Atlantic venture.\nThe company, which farms across several states, withdrew an earlier 11-lot proposal for part of the same site in 2021 after neighbor pushback.\nOpposition this time has been loud and sharp. On social media and in civic groups, residents warned of \u201cSouth Forkification,\u201d shorthand for the creeping luxury and second-home influx that\u2019s transformed the Hamptons. Critics question whether 47 multimillion-dollar homes will serve the local community or simply add to traffic and strain local services.\nCivic leaders are watching closely. Carolyn McCall, president of the local civic association in Cutchogue, said the group may host a forum on the plan once a revised sketch is filed.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the town will continue to strike that balance between economic development and also the preservation of our land and the quality of life that we enjoy so much out here in Southold,\u201d board member Dave Bergen told the publication.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The mosque has owned the site, alternatively addressed at 120 Madison Street, since the 1980s.\nThe venture aims to raze the three-story property and replace it with a 12-story, 94,000-square-foot building with 144 senior housing units, according to a rezoning application submitted to the Department of City Planning.\nThe development would include more than 13,000 square feet of community space and nearly 5,000 square feet of commercial space; the former would be reserved for the mosque and the Clara Muhammad School, both of which currently occupy 44,000 square feet at the site.\nThe project is expected to cost at least $90 million, according to a post on the developer\u2019s website, which detailed a project smaller in scope than what\u2019s planned now. Neither the developer nor the mosque immediately responded to requests for comment from the outlet.\nPierre Downing\u2019s Kalel Companies is largely known in New York City for its projects under NYCHA\u2019s Permanent Affordability Commitment Together program, putting public housing developments under private management. The firm has several projects in the works, according to its\nwebsite\n, including a first foray into New Jersey via Jersey City.\nElsewhere in Bed-Stuy, Jacob Fulop\nfiled plans\nin June for a 120-unit project at 1445 Fulton Street, which would span 76,000 square feet and rise 12 stories, reaching 119 feet tall. Fulop purchased 1445 Fulton Street, 1439 Fulton Street and 484 Tompkins Avenue last April for $5.5 million.\nOther examples of religious buildings being repurposed for housing include a shuttered church at 181 Avenue D in the East Village, which the Archdiocese of New York agreed to sell to Spatial Equity and Community Access for a minimum of\n$58 million\nlast year. The buyers hope to turn the one-and-a-half-acre lot into a 570-unit, fully affordable housing community.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

A source indicated that the comments, viewed as Islamophobic, were the reason for the firing.\nPanzer did not return a request for comment.\n\u201cWe can confirm Scott Panzer is no longer with JLL. The views and sentiment expressed in his email do not align with our company\u2019s culture and shared values,\u201d said a JLL spokesperson.\nPanzer is one of the top office leasing brokers in the city. At one time, he oversaw leasing at Sheldon Solow\u2019s 9 West 57th Street.\nOne day after Mamdani\u2019s win, real estate executives struck a\ncautiously optimistic tone\n, focusing on elements of the mayor-elect\u2019s agenda where they see common ground, including his commitment to build more affordable housing.\nStill, others fear the effect of his promise to freeze rents for stabilized apartments for four years, with one landlord group saying the move would result in nothing short of \u201caffordable housing Armageddon.\u201d\n",

They\u2019re coming all the more because we are the place to do business.\u201d\nAbood shared insights into the current state of South Florida\u2019s office market alongside Ryan Holtzman, executive managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and David Moret, founder of\nHighline Real Estate Capital\n. For the most part, new tenants with deep budgets flocking to new projects in Brickell, downtown Miami, Wynwood, Miami Beach and Coconut Grove are propping up the region.\n\u201cWhen these groups come into town, they\u2019re used to class A buildings in New York, Chicago and California,\u201d Holtzman said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re willing to pay up to be in the best buildings.\u201d\nFor instance,\nThe Fifth Miami Beach\n, a five-story boutique building currently under construction in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood, is among the most expensive new projects in South Florida, Holtzman noted.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield is handling leasing for The Fifth Miami Beach, which is being developed by Sumaida + Khurana and Bizzi + Bilgili \u2013\u2013 a joint venture between Turkish investor Serdar Bilgili\u2019s BLG Capital and Bizzi &amp; Partners. The new building will have 60,200 square feet of offices, retail and dining space.\n\u201cThe Fifth Miami Beach is a jewel box,\u201d Holtzman said. \u201cIt has a ton of demand. We\u2019re close to 90 percent [leased] in terms of deals that we\u2019re negotiating on, and we\u2019re hitting record rents [for the city] between $180 to $240 [a square foot].\u201d\nAbood grilled Holtzman about new tenants eventually pushing back on high asking rents. \u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019ll be some point in time when companies are going to say \u2018Enough. I\u2019m not coming to Miami for $240 a square foot.\u2019\u201d\nHoltzman insisted projects like The Fifth Miami Beach are attracting hedge funds and private equity firms that are leasing spaces of 10,000 square feet or less. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s a small amount based on the quality of where they want to be and the type of asset.\u201d\nIn the next couple of years, he expects the Miami-Dade office submarket to experience a boost from tenants seeking spaces larger than 10,000 square feet at competitive rates. Those firms, he said, will flock to new office spaces in projects like\nMiami Freedom Park\n, a $1 billion mixed-use project anchored by a soccer stadium being developed by Inter Miami MLS franchise owners, billionaire Jorge Mas, retired international soccer star David Beckham and Ares Management.\nThe developers are currently building the project\u2019s first office building that will have 250,000 square feet of space, which is being marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Holtzman said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get much larger tenants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see corporate groups relocated from Charlottes of the world and Atlantas of the world. That\u2019s going to be a different price point and a different type of product.\u201d\nYet, the overall office space in Miami-Dade County is shrinking, noted Highline\u2019s Moret. \u201cRoughly 10 percent of the entire office market has either been demolished or is going to be demolished for industrial or multifamily,\u201d Moret said. \u201cAnd, at the same time, you\u2019ve got a flight to quality because tenants want to get their employees back in the office.\u201d\nInstitutional owners of older office buildings are also seeking exit strategies, Moret said. \u201cOffice is still a four-letter word,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is pretty much zero institutional capital chasing office these days.\u201d",

        "content": "One of the best ways to get a\nmultifamily development\nto pencil in this sluggish economy is to add an\naffordability\ncomponent.\nThat\u2019s what JPI is doing to get some momentum behind its latest project, Jefferson Quail Creek in the northwest DFW city of Denton, according to a news release.\nThe company\u2019s third workforce community construction start this year, the 415-unit project, at 3855 Hudsonwood Road, is expected to cost $103.2 million. JPI is partnering with Denton Housing Authority to develop the apartment complex.\nIt will feature a pool, courtyard with grills, beer garden, indoor-outdoor gym and dog park.\nJPI also recently started construction on nearby\nJefferson Bonnie Brae\n, which it\u2019s building with the help of tax-exempt municipal bonds. Denton Housing Authority owns the land and is projected to receive $35 million in equity from the deal in the first decade. The 461-unit workforce housing community will be located at North Bonnie Brae Street and Bronco Way, also in Denton.\nDenton is the northern tip of a triangle that includes Fort Worth and Dallas, about 40 miles away from each. It has a population of about 166,000 and has been boosted by the wave of growth north of Dallas.\nDespite the wave of multifamily construction and apartment deliveries in North Texas, the region is still\nshort more than 80,000 housing units\n, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation. And the gap continues to grow.\nThe recent passage of state legislation like\nSenate Bill 840\naimed to make multifamily development easier in big Texas cities by removing barriers for developers trying to convert buildings with other uses to apartments.\nAs much as residents of northern DFW suburbs claim to be proponents of the slogan \u201cDon\u2019t California My Texas,\u201d political leaders responded to the law\u2019s passage in a very California way \u2014 by\npassing measures to curb\nlawmakers\u2019 attempt to encourage apartment development. Cities like Irving, Plano, Frisco and Arlington have considered adding height requirements and other measures stipulating what kind of amenities an apartment building needs to have.\n",

Bruehl is not joining Christie\u2019s with any of his Saunders listings.\nThough Christie\u2019s opened its East Hampton office in November 2023, the firm has\nyet to make a splash\nin the enclave, a sentiment Bruehl acknowledged to\nTRD.\nHe described the brokerage\u2019s debut as \u201cunderbranded.\u201d Now that he\u2019s at the helm, however, Bruehl plans to build up awareness of the outpost.\nAs managing director, Bruehl is tasked with leading the 15 agents headquartered at the firm\u2019s East End location, including 30-year veteran Bonita DeWolf and Sanda Busch of the New York City-based Gottlieb Team.\nHe plans on hiring a small number of \u201ctop-shelf senior producers\u201d with the goal of eventually opening offices in Southampton and Westhampton. He added that he intends to double down on harnessing social media and podcasts to sell real estate.\nBruehl said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d with his time at Saunders. He added that he wasn\u2019t looking to leave the firm when he met with the Christie\u2019s affiliate\u2019s owner, president and CEO, Ilija Pavlovic. He said the decision to exit Saunders came after the two had a four-hour lunch at the top of the Rockefeller Center,\nHe said a major selling point for him was that he\u2019d be running the only Christie\u2019s office in the region. He also touted the firm\u2019s relationship with the auction house and the opportunity to travel to the company\u2019s affiliates in other countries, including an upcoming trip to Portugal, Amsterdam and London.\n\u201cI always knew that there would come a time when I would need an international brand,\u201d Bruehl said. \u201cOnce my online brand was big enough, my buyer pool broader and my seller clients broader, I knew I would need a bigger platform.\u201d\nPavlovic added that the Hamptons have increasingly become \u201can international destination.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d Pavlovic said. \u201cFor us, this is the first big step in a new direction.\u201d\nPavlovic also touted the firm\u2019s relationship with developers as a draw for Bruehl, including what Pavlovic claimed was the largest portfolio of new development in New Jersey, with more than $1 billion in the pipeline. In New York, the firm\nformed a partnership\nwith new development veteran, Shlomi Reuveni.\nAndrew Saunders, president of Saunders, did not respond to a request for comment.\nBefore joining Saunders in 2015, Bruehl was with Sotheby\u2019s International. He also served as a financial advisor with Morgan Stanley during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n",

He further predicted the banks would try to quickly sell the building, referring to it to\nCrain\u2019s\nas \u201ckryptonite to a lender.\u201d\nVornado chief executive officer Steven Roth appears resigned to the loss. During an earnings call on Tuesday, he said that \u201cbad stuff happens every once in a while, even to us,\u201d while noting the firm wrote off its stake in the property three years ago.\nThe debt behind the Class A office building was sent to special servicing last month after the borrower failed to meet payment obligations, according to Morningstar Credit.\nLocated between East 59th and 60th streets, the 28-story office and retail building totals 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by a group of investors \u2014 including Vornado, Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System \u2014 in 2013 for roughly $1.3 billion.\nOwnership secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy have fallen since then. Occupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued, but Ralph Lauren \u2014 which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building \u2014\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\npaying\nabout 30 percent less in rent.\nOccupancy dipped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is back up to 74 percent. Office tenants include Lakewood Capital, according to Vornado\u2019s website, while retail space is occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property saw its value fall; once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nVornado\u2019s\nrevenue\nfor the third quarter was $453.7 million, a 2.4 percent year-over-year increase.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Matt Katsaros is on a spree of deals.\nShortly after notching a win in Lakeview, his development firm\nWilwood Investments\nsold a 36-unit apartment building in Lincoln Park for $28 million.\nThe sale price of the building, which is located at 2411 North Lincoln Avenue, was boosted by two ground-level retail spaces that are currently leased by Wells Fargo and Panera Bread, Katsaros said.\nThe buyer was Chicago-based Highgate Capital Group, which focuses on multifamily investments in secondary markets and didn\u2019t return a request for comment. While it\u2019s unclear exactly how much money the development team put into the project, Katsaros said it sold with a 6 percent capitalization rate.\nWilwood, along with general contractor Contemporary Concepts, opted to build a smaller number of 3- and 4-bedroom units on the oddly shaped triangular lot rather than a higher number of studios and one-bedroom units because of its proximity to\nDePaul University\n. The building is more likely to be occupied by tenants living with roommates than properties in other areas of Chicago, Katsaros said.\n\u201cKnowing that the DePaul campus is across the street, it\u2019s a pretty youthful base,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has 36 units but 98 bedrooms, all rented by the unit.\u201d\nThe developers also got lucky with a well-timed ordinance change in Chicago that allowed them to reduce the amount of parking spaces they originally intended to include and instead pivot to adding an additional retail space that was eventually filled by Panera. In 2022, the city passed a Transit-Served Location Ordinance that lowered parking requirements for developments within a certain distance from a public transit stop. The\nordinance was expanded\nearlier this year.\n\u201cWe had programmed a one-to-one [unit-to-parking spot ratio] but we ended up going down to about 50 percent,\u201d he said.\nWildwood bought the development site from\nSterling Bay\nin 2021. Before that, it was a privately-owned greenspace called Julia Porter Park.\nAlthough the team eventually put together a proposal that maximized profitability of the site, it wasn\u2019t an easy parcel to work with. The apartment building comes to a sharp point at the six-cornered intersection of Lincoln, Fullerton avenues and North Halsted Street on the triangular shaped lot.\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re limited to 36 units, we made the best of it and we designed as many multiple bedroom units as we could fit in that triangle,\u201d he said.\nThe deal comes on the heels of solid win from Wilwood and Contemporary Concepts in Lakeview.\nThe team sold a 95-unit, two-building complex known as the Low-Line Commons for $40 million to Utah-based Highland Partners The deal came out to about $421,000 per unit. Similar to the Lincoln Park sale, the deal came out to a 6 percent capitalization rate, according to Katsaros.\nHe has also\nbeen a buyer\nof late. Wildwood last month revealed it\u2019s pursuing an office-to-residential conversion of the seven-story loft building at 230 East Ohio Street that it bought for $9.75 million from\nHorizon Realty Group\n.\n",

It would also subject any properties with 10 or more complaints to heightened inspections and potential fines.\nThe Houston Apartment Association led the opposition, arguing that the ordinance would unfairly penalize larger complexes and lacked sufficient due process.\nHAA CEO Casey Morgan criticized the speed with which the proposal was being advanced. The city attorney echoed some of those concerns, warning that the lack of an appeals process could make the program difficult to enforce.\nThe registry plan is a scaled-back version of a tougher proposal floated in May that would have registered every\nmultifamily property\nwith at least 10\nhabitability complaints\nover a year. Those include issues related to plumbing, electricity and structural safety \u2014 problems the city already inspects for buildings with three or more units.\nMayor John Whitmire\nacknowledged the difficulty in balancing tenant protection with a measure that\u2019s legally sound and practical to enforce.\n\u201cThe challenge is to get something that\u2019s tough enough and that actually is enforceable,\u201d Whitmire said.\nTenant advocacy groups have argued the plan doesn\u2019t go far enough. They suggested a public database to help renters steer clear of unsafe buildings and force negligent landlords to make repairs.\nPlummer, who\u2019s championed the effort for four years and is preparing to leave the council to run for Harris County Judge, expressed frustration over the delay and the likelihood of further revisions that could water-down its intent.\n\u201cI think the people that are living, actually experiencing the conditions, are going to hate it,\u201d Plummer told the outlet.\nThe council is expected to revisit the proposal Dec. 10.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But the influx will fall short of that during the pandemic, which propelled South Florida\u2019s market to new heights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly top of mind for New Yorkers to move to South Florida,\u201d Miguel, founder and CEO of Coconut Grove-based Mast Capital, said at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Thursday.\nAt Miami Beach\u2019s 17-story, 82-unit Perigon condo tower, which Mast is co-developing with Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group, 10 buyer \u201cleads\u201d came in after Tuesday\u2019s election, more than the three to five that were more common pre-election, Miguel said. Also post-election, Colombo said he spoke with two New Yorkers who expressed their plan to move south.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything near what Covid brought to Miami,\u201d Colombo, founder of Miami-based\nCMC Group\n, said at the forum. \u201cThere will be an influx. I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to swing the market.\u201d\nThe pair spoke during the panel \u201cPushing the Envelope: Where Top Developers Are Placing Their Biggest Bets\u201d on Thursday hosted by\nTRD\n\u2019s Residential Bureau Chief Katherine Kallergis. Both developers said they plan to heighten marketing of Miami condo projects to New York buyers.\nBut despite the potential boost of additional demand from New York, South Florida\u2019s condo development market continues to deal with some headwinds.\n\u201cThe market has softened in certain sectors. There\u2019s been a lot of product that\u2019s been presented to the market,\u201d Colombo said, adding that traditionally condo supply has outpaced demand in Miami. \u201cThere are \u2026 projects that have been presented that maybe couldn\u2019t get financing. It wasn\u2019t just the best.\u201d\nOver the past year, South Florida has experienced some reprieve on interest rates due to two benchmark rate drops this year, and insurance, thanks to a calmer hurricane season, and a drop in loan spreads, Miguel said. Construction costs, which had been elevated for years, calmed, but this drop was then undone by Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cThe luxury market continues to remain strong,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cWe are seeing some commodity product that\u2019s maybe not moving at the pace the market would like to see. We cannot ignore some headwinds.\u201d\nLenders also became more conservative due to hefty condo construction and supply in South Florida. Some financiers, especially banks, also stepped back amid higher interest rates. The developers said that\u2019s mostly affected financing for mid-market projects, but not top-tier towers.\nColombo, whose CMC is starting construction on the 70-unit Four Seasons Private Residences in Coconut Grove on Thursday, said he had no problem financing the project.\n\u201cWe had many, many choices,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also looking at another project I haven\u2019t announced. It\u2019s a bigger, higher, taller building and there I see some resistance from lenders, on the middle market.\u201d\nColombo and Miguel both have embraced South Florida branded condo development craze.\nAside from the Four Seasons, Colombo also is developing the 65-unit\nVita at Grove Isle\non roughly 6 acres on the 20-acre Grove Isle in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. Vita is its own standalone brand.\nCMC is partnering with Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners for the\nFour Seasons\n. Fort has exclusivity for the brand in South Florida.\nAside from the\nPerigon\n, Mast is developing the 80-story, 397-unit luxury\nCipriani Residences\nin Miami\u2019s Brickell. The Perigon is over 80 percent pre-sold, and Cipriani over 70 percent, Miguel said.\nMiguel said condo branding is one way \u201cto try to reduce friction and create revenue\u201d in the current development climate, along with location and design. For Colombo, differentiating his projects means not pinching pennies on finishes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at making the last penny. Look at making the customer happy because that eventually is going to pay off at the end,\u201d Colombo said.\nDuring the question and answer section of the panel, one South Florida transplant from New York, who said he moved south about four years ago, countered the developers\u2019 notion that\nMamdani\u2019s win\nwon\u2019t be as beneficial to Miami\u2019s market as the pandemic.\n\u201cYou guys need to build more buildings,\u201d the man said, adding that a huge population influx is coming.\nColombo, who during the panel pointed out the scarcity of developable sites on the ocean and in Brickell, said costs remain an issue for starting more projects.\n\u201cWe need to find a way to do it cheaper,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Entertainment giant\nAEG Worldwide\npulled back the curtain on the latest plans for a mixed-use tower on a surface parking lot in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe company, also known as Anschutz Entertainment Group, submitted an application to build a 49-story residential and hotel building in downtown Los Angeles, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe property, at 917-931 West Olympic Boulevard and 920-948 South Georgia Street, is poised for a 49-story tower rising 631 feet. The building would feature a 334-room hotel and 364 residential units on the upper floors. A restaurant, bar, pool, meeting rooms, club room, fitness center, ballroom and a 112,600-square-foot entertainment venue are also planned.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a string of efforts to build on sites near AEG\u2019s L.A. Live.\nDeveloper City Century once proposed building a multi-tower complex at 1001 West Olympic Boulevard; a few years later, separate plans for a slim high-rise at the corner of Olympic Boulevard and Figueroa Street were approved.\nMore than a decade ago, AEG planned to build a Renaissance Hotel at 917 Olympic Boulevard in partnership with Williams &amp; Dame, and in 2016, it looked to build a 38-story expansion of the J.W. Marriott across the street. AEG abandoned the projects in subsequent years.\nThe latest push to build around L.A. Live comes after the\nCity Council gave its blessing\nin September to the $2.6 billion expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center south of the L.A. Live entertainment complex.\nIn 2021, AEG extended its lease with the Los Angeles Lakers at the L.A. Live-adjacent\nCrypto.com Arena\nthrough 2041 and committed to extensive renovations there. The deal included an agreement from AEG to\nspend nine figures\nto improve and update the arena, adding to AEG\u2019s renovations at its other properties in the area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A new lawsuit filed in Texas state court accuses syndicator\nAlan Stalcup\nof \u201ccooking the books\u201d at his company GVA, packaging bad debt as assets and bonds.\nThe plaintiffs accuse Stalcup, his wife Loren and GVA\u2019s former vice president David Graham Bass of an \u201cegregious criminal pattern of fraud, theft, and deceit.\u201d\nStalcup responded by calling the suit an \u201cextortion attempt from a disgruntled investor\u201d and said he would seek to countersue. Bass did not respond to a request for comment.\nStalcup and his firm GVA gained prominence as a syndicator, compiling funds from individual and institutional investors to buy up and manage underperforming apartment complexes. An investment would buy a management interest in one of the shell companies GVA used to buy property. Investors also paid management fees to GVA, according to the lawsuit.\nStalcup\u2019s bet that he could fix up the multifamily buildings worked out while interest rates were low. But when rates surged, syndicators broadly struggled to keep up with their loans.\nStalcup and the other defendants then conspired to inflate rental income and profits, plaintiffs allege. They re-packaged bad debt, concessions and operating expenses as assets and capital expenses, making the properties look more profitable, and thus valuable.\n\u201cIn 2023 alone, the GVA Defendants falsely overstated the reported rental income across its entire portfolio by over $20.6 million, which in turn served to inflate values of the properties in its portfolio by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d plaintiffs wrote in their petition.\nIn one example cited in the suit, financial documents purportedly show one property\u2019s monthly net operating income boosted by $133,558. GVA oversaw approximately 150 properties.\nThe alleged fraud also entitled the defendants to charge higher management fees, according to the lawsuit. The petition excerpts internal GVA financial documents that show instructions to move money out of concessions and delinquency categories.\nThe suit was filed by a group of investment entities: Hill Country Hillside, Ltd, River Retreat 1228 LLC, Hill Country Meridian LLC and Sierra HC LLC. At least two of the plaintiff companies are connected to Texas commercial real estate investor Bryan Kastleman. They claim they lost more than $15 million after being fraudulently induced to invest in GVA-managed companies connected to ten real estate projects and portfolios.\nThe plaintiffs claim Stalcup resorted to another scheme to keep the company going when things got tight. After interest rates surged and GVA\u2019s debt obligations became unmanageable, Stalcup made capital calls, plaintiffs allege. Those calls led plaintiffs to believe that the funds Stalcup and his codefendants were requesting would be used to stabilize properties and meet debt obligations.\nBut after they invested, they say that wasn\u2019t the case. Instead of stabilizing the properties, the defendants allegedly made up their own personal losses. In one instance, Stalcup misappropriated about $3.4 million to repay GVA\u2019s own bridge loans, according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit is just the latest for Stalcup and GVA.\nIn February, lender\nBenefit Street Partners alleged GVA\nmisappropriated insurance proceeds and commingled tenant security deposits. Those \u201cbad boy\u201d acts activate the personal guarantees that Stalcup signed on a $346 million loan from Benefit Street, backed by 19 multifamily properties, the lender argued in court. Stalcup denied the lender\u2019s allegations, calling them \u201cfarcical and utterly outrageous.\u201d He said the loans had been paid back or were performing. The suit is still pending.\nThis summer, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood\nslapped Stalcup\nwith a trio of lawsuits. The lender said the sponsor let liens pile up on several properties and failed to pay interest, triggering personal recourse guarantees. Those suits are also pending.\n",

If you can get a shooting range, you get a shooting range \u2026 The client of the \u201890s and the client of the 2000s is not the same client in \u201925.\u201d\nDesign is commanding greater attention as more buyers seek primary residences in Miami, not just second homes, said panelist\nPascal Nicolai,\na Miami-based spec developer of luxury homes. \u201cThe best house is the one you want to stay inside and live in forever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to make spec houses very personal \u2026. The idea is, when you go into the house, you feel the vibe.\u201d\nHowever, as residential property values escalate, some buyers are selling custom-designed luxury homes soon after buying them, said panelist\nMax Strang\n, founder and managing partner of Miami-based Strang Design.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working with an owner, an end user, for several years, designing, permitting, building. They move in, the Realtors swarm them, and they end up selling their forever house,\u201d Strang said.\n\u201cProbably four or five of our clients thought they were going to be living in their house, and they love it, but sometimes the money talks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that a lot because of the increase in property values.\u201d\nThe panelists agreed that some buyers demand luxury home designs that are more expensive than they can afford.\n\u201cIf we sense that there is an impossible matchup of budget and program, you have to have those decisions [made] upfront, so we\u2019re not wasting everybody\u2019s time and everybody\u2019s money,\u201d Strang said.\nYet many wealthy buyers are willing to pay more than architects expect to get the home and location they want, Choeff said, citing his work on a Miami Beach mansion for former soccer star\nDavid Beckham\n, president and co-owner of Inter Miami CF.\n\u201cThe buyers of today will spend a lot more money than you think they will,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain residences are put up at a certain price, and you say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get this price, but we\u2019ll settle for this price.\u2019 But they get it. And an example is, Beckham spent $72.3 million on a house we designed on North Bay Road.\u201d\nPast trends in residential architecture in Miami have included a preference for Art Deco and\nMediterranean\ndesigns, and new trends are emerging, the panelists said.\n\u201cIt was probably the very late \u201890s and early 2000s when Modernism started to creep back in and was accepted and desired. A lot of that can get bastardized right now,\u201d Strang said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going straight back to the Mediterranean Revival,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be more traditional influences coming in. But the challenge for us is to make it design forward.\u201d",

        "content": "Macquarie Capital | Principal Finance and Vanderbilt Office Properties sold a multifamily development site approved for nearly 300 units in Boca Raton for $21.2 million.\nNADG, or North American Development Group, bought the 6.8-acre site at 1800 North Military Trail, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The land shares the same lot as a four-story building and a garage that are part of the Boca Center office campus. Macquarie and Vanderbilt kept the office building and garage.\nNADG, which has offices in West Palm Beach and Toronto, Ontario, is a retail, residential and mixed-use investment firm that John W. S. Preston founded in 1977, its website shows. Jeff W. Preston is CEO. The firm has a portfolio consisting of more than $6 billion of assets under management, including roughly 10,000 units and over 19 million square feet of retail and mixed-use space.\nThe Boca Raton site is proposed for a six-story building with 295 apartments, including 30 units at affordable rents and 15 units at workforce rents, Vizzda data shows. It would have six studios, 134 one-bedroom apartments, 113 two-bedroom apartments and 42 three-bedroom apartments. The height is proposed for 66 feet, which generally would mean a roughly six-story building.\nAbout half the site would be open space.\nMacquarie and Vanderbilt bought the majority of\nBoca Center\n, including the lot at 1800 North Military Trail, for\n$261.5 million\nin 2022. The pair had paid $76.1 million for the 1800 North Military Trail site.\nMacquarie is the financing and investment division of Sydney, Australia-based Macquarie Group, led by CEO Shemara Wikramanayake.\nChicago-based Vanderbilt is an office investor led by CEO Casey Wold. It has a portfolio of 13 million square feet, its website shows.\nSouth Florida is experiencing continuing\nmultifamily\ndevelopment, despite a supply overhang due to hefty completions in recent years. Last year, developers finished\n18,600 apartments\nin the tri-county region, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group.\nThe construction spree has raised concerns about a prolonged supply overhang, which could continue downward pressure on rent growth and continuing concessions, experts have said. But developers argue that by the time they finish their buildings, the current supply will be absorbed and demand will be higher.\nAlso in Boca Raton, Group P6 and Mill Creek Residential plan the 12-story, 306-unit\nModera Boca\nat 400 South Dixie Highway. Arnaud Karsenti\u2019s 13th Floor Investments scored approval in January for the eight-story, 340-unit Boca Village apartment project at 680 West Yamato Road in Boca Raton.\nMany developers have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that rewards developers with property tax breaks if they include below-market rate apartments. The legislation also allows developers to build bigger buildings than permitted by zoning.\nIn Coral Gables, Shoma Group plans the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\nat 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street, marking the first known Live Local Act project in the city.\n",

        "content": "Local labor groups are fighting the City of Berkeley\u2019s approval of what would be the\ntallest residential tower\nin the Southside neighborhood.\nThe Building and Construction Trades of Alameda County and the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council have appealed the city\u2019s approvals for a 20-story, 169-unit project at 2425 Durant Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The unions argue that Yes Duffy Architects improperly sidestepped recently enacted municipal laws in proposing the new,\nstudent-oriented housing\n.\nThe groups are targeting exemptions from Berkeley\u2019s Helping Achieve Responsible Development with Healthcare and Apprenticeship Training Standards (HARD HATS) ordinance as well as the Southside\nprevailing wage requirement\n, both of which took effect this year. The unions say the city allowing Yes Duffy to avoid providing healthcare and apprenticeships for its workers and to not pay the general prevailing wage were a \u201cmisuse\u201d of the laws.\n\u201cThe trades council and Carpenters have never encountered such concession requests before and are not aware of any project that has received similar concessions from the city (or any city),\u201d Jolene Kramer, legal counsel for the unions, said in a letter to the city.\nIn response, Mark Rhoades, a consultant working on the project, said the construction labor requirements would add \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to the overall project costs. Total labor costs alone would purportedly increase around 20 to 25 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another attempt by the unions to create positions for themselves that make housing a lot more expensive to build, particularly in Berkeley, where the fees are the highest in the state,\u201d Rhoades said.\nWhen the HARD HATS\nordinance\nwas introduced in 2023, many developers balked at the law and the costs that it would tack on to many projects. As a result, City Hall was flooded with preliminary applications under SB 330 to lock in earlier, less restrictive zoning standards. The Southside prevailing wage requirements went into effect early last year after the City Council\u2019s upzoning of the Southside neighborhood.\nThe 2425 Durant Avenue project will go before the Berkeley City Council in February when council members will vote on whether to reject or accept the unions\u2019 appeal. The City Council already rejected an attempt to designate the site, currently hosting a Victorian home and two other residential buildings dating back more than a century, as a historic landmark earlier this year.\nYes Duffy Architects plans to start construction in January 2028 once design and building permits are secured.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The sellers are classic car enthusiasts Don and Paulette Clark. A car showroom takes up half of the property\u2019s 12,500 square feet, which made it difficult to price, said listing agent Holly Haven of eXp Realty.\n\u201cOn traditional\nMLS\nand marketing, it was like finding a needle in a haystack to find that perfect buyer,\u201d Haven said. \u201cWe also listed right before election time last year, so, being in real estate 20-plus years, I know that that can definitely slow down a market.\u201d\nAlthough the home is in a secluded area, more homes are planned for surrounding lots, which prospective sellers had to take into account, Haven said.\nThe auction was arranged by\nFlorida-based firm Elite Auctions\n. The property spent over a year on the MLS before Elite accepted it and began marketing.\nA local oil and gas executive bought the property with a cash offer, Haven said. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the buyer\u2019s offer was \u201cclose to asking price,\u201d Elite Auctions market director Alicia Chmielewski said.\nThe nearby\nMcKinney National Airport\nalso attracted the buyer, who has\nprivate planes\n, Haven said.\nThe luxury market is gradually rebounding from an\nexceptionally low period\nnationwide. Year over year, the median luxury home price rose 5 percent in September; however, September luxury sales are near the lowest levels on record, going back to 2012, according to\nRedfin\n.\nDallas tracks these national trends. The median luxury sale price in Dallas was up 6 percent in September \u2014 the highest price growth of any major metro in Texas \u2014 but the number of sales was down 4 percent.\n\u201cHere in North Texas, we\u2019ve been in great shape.

        "content": "Would you rather vote for a candidate who credibly defends a position or one who is, well, chicken shit?\nIt\u2019s a loaded question, but relevant when it comes to real estate.\nWhen Republican Kristy Marmorato defeated Democrat Marjorie Vel\u00e1zquez for an East Bronx City Council seat in 2023, some feared that Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s support for a\ncontroversial development\nwould make other Council members hesitant to defy NIMBY activists in their districts.\nThen\nMarmorato herself lost\non Tuesday, falling to a Democratic challenger. Pro-housing group Open New York had\nendorsed her challenger\n, but in all likelihood, the incumbent\u2019s defeat had little to do with her anti-development stances, such as her insistence on\npreserving parking minimums\nin the rezonings around planned Metro-North stations.\nAnti-Trump fervor just made this a bad year for Republican candidates, just as 2023 was a good one. Marmorato won her seat because of fortuitous timing, not because she opposed the rezoning of Bruckner Boulevard.\nMarmorato\u2019s subsequent loss should put to rest the notion that city voters reward politicians for being anti-development. They simply don\u2019t. In another example, neighborhood NIMBYs tried to oust Democrat Shahana Hanif from a Brooklyn Council seat in June and\nfailed miserably\n.\nThe Bronx seat\u2019s flipping to a Republican and then back to a Democrat had far more to do with voters\u2019 feelings about inflation (2023) and about President Donald Trump (2025) than with development issues.\nGenerally speaking, city voters favor development, even if the loudest voices in a room don\u2019t. The results of this year\u2019s\nCity Charter ballot questions\nspeak to that.\nThat said, rarely do development issues decide candidates\u2019 fates. Eric Adams has been the most pro-development mayor in memory (yes, including Mike Bloomberg), but because of unrelated scandals, his re-election campaign never got out of the starting gate.\nHad Adams kowtowed to NIMBYs, he would have little to show for his mayoralty. At least he can look back and say he paved the way for growth and housing affordability.\nFor me, the lesson for elected officials is not to be paranoid and reactive on real estate issues, but to take positions based on what is best for the city. It\u2019s almost certainly not going to hurt you in the next election \u2014 and if you make a strong case for your stances, voters will appreciate it.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCommercial broker Scott Panzer was fired by JLL for comparing Zohran Mamdani to Hitler,\nTRD\n\u2019s Rich Bockmann and Kathryn Brenzel\nreported\n. Separately, a former New Yorker now in Texas told me he would never return to the city because of Mamdani\u2019s election, which had left two of his New York City friends in tears. Are people overreacting? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Building four Metro-North stations in the East Bronx is not the hard part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s Penn Station Access project. \u201cThe hard part is a massive rehabilitation project on Amtrak\u2019s Hell Gate Line \u2026 which is in rough shape,\u201d the MTA\u2019s latest construction newsletter explains. It identifies the \u201ccentral tension\u201d as Amtrak\u2019s ownership of the right-of-way and its inability to provide enough service outages, support staff or operational resources to keep work on schedule.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe impact of Mamdani\u2019s election on the \u201c\nConstruction Justice Act\n\u201d is worth watching. The bill would set a higher minimum wage for workers on city-funded affordable housing projects. That\u2019s the kind of thing socialists support, because they want the government rather than market forces to decide workers\u2019 pay and benefits. And I would think the Council would prefer to let Mamdani sign the bill than to override a veto by Mayor Adams.\nAnother factor is that Mamdani likes unions, and unions like the bill because the government would be raising wages \u2014 saving organized labor the trouble, or achieving what labor has been unable to through organizing and negotiating.\nThe Council did the same thing last month for\nsecurity workers\non behalf of 32BJ SEIU, using the\nkilling of a guard\nat 345 Park Avenue to defeat the real estate industry\u2019s lobbying efforts.\nBut the mayoralty isn\u2019t the only office changing. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will have to decide whether to push the construction bill through before her tenure ends. Then she could take the credit, while leaving the inevitable legal challenge for her successor to deal with.\nThe obvious conflict for Mamdani is that the bill would make affordable housing more expensive to build.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$9.5 million\nfor a 2901-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis of The Corcoran Group had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$26.4 million\nfor a 16,937-square-foot property at 160 West 74th Street on the Upper West Side. The previous owner tied to Bayrock Capital purchased the property from The Calhoun School for\n$14 million in 2023\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$30 million\nfor a 6,600-square-foot, single family townhouse at 4 Staple Street in Tribeca. Jeremy V. Stein and Kat Trappe with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for two 14-story buildings at 335 and 345 West 25th Street in Kips Bay. They will have a combined 197 units (98 and 99). David West of Hill West filed the permits on behalf of Timber Equities.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Aflalo family hopes to sell four parcels entitled for a combined 368 residential units in Beverly Hills, according to a new offering memorandum from Westmack Commercial Brokerage Company.\nThe parcels, all builder\u2019s remedy projects clustered at West Olympic Boulevard and South Beverly Drive, are listed from $20 million to $87 million, with a combined value of $132 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the largest commercial land offerings in Beverly Hills history,\u201d Westmack\u2019s T.C. Macker said.\nPlans call for 74 affordable units spread over the four projects, along with 37,276 square feet of ground-floor retail, and parking.\nSites include 333-337 South Beverly Drive and\n353 South Beverly Drive\n, approved for an eight-story building with 135 residential units, 16,099 square feet of ground-floor retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 263 parking spaces; and the Pavilions grocery store site at\n9467 West Olympic Boulevard\n, with an eight-story building with 105 residential units, 17,085 square feet of retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 180 parking spaces. Those sites are priced as a package at $87 million.\nSammy Aflalo\nof Aflalo Equities helmed the entitlement process of the two sites. Sammy Aflalo is the son of Moshe and Laura Aflalo, whose\nAflalo Family Trust\ngrew a portfolio of stores in L.A.\u2019s Fashion District in the 1990s. The sites are\nco-owned\nwith Harkham Family Enterprises, run by Uri Harkham, also a prominent property holder in the Fashion District and well beyond.\nThe offering also includes\n9430 West Olympic Boulevard\n, approved for a 13-story mixed-use building with 53 residential units and three levels of subterranean parking with 23 parking spaces. The tower would replace a three-story commercial building built in 1989. It has an asking price of $20 million.\nAlso part of the offering is 9441 West Olympic Boulevard, approved for a 13-story building with 75 residential units, 4,092 square feet of ground-floor retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 52 parking spaces. Its asking price is $25 million.\nAflalo Equities, in a joint venture with Fisch Property, the property management arm of the family business, led the entitlement process for 9430 Olympic Boulevard and 9441 West Olympic Boulevard.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy is a loophole in state housing law that lets developers skirt zoning rules in cities that fail to certify their state housing plans, as long as they include at least 20 percent affordable housing.\n\u201cThese approvals, granted under builder\u2019s remedy, allow for height, [floor area ratio] and unit counts that far exceed surrounding properties,\u201d said Westmack\u2019s Macker, who holds the listing for the properties.\nAs of Oct. 30 there were 14 active builder\u2019s remedy applications before the City of Beverly Hills, according to Ryan Gohlich, assistant city manager in Beverly Hills.\nBeverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian said on the general topic of builder\u2019s remedy that there\u2019s a mismatch between policy intent and market outcomes.\n\u201cWhat was intended as a tool to create more affordable housing has, in practice, often been used to push through ultra-luxury, high-density projects, and with only a small fraction of them being actual affordable units,\u201d Nazarian told\nThe Real Deal\nat the end of October. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s sufficient demand for so many expensive luxury units. Prices continue to rise, and the average renter or young families or young professionals, they\u2019re still being priced out.\u201d\nMacker touted the offering for its \u201cscale, prime location, and significance in a market known for its limited supply.\u201d\nProlific developer\nLeo Pustilnikov\n, who received approval for a builder\u2019s remedy project at\n125-129 South Linden Drive\nand is a partner in another such project at 346 North Maple Drive, said he is not interested in the Aflalo family\u2019s offering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s massively overpriced\u2026 and [there\u2019s an] issue with the lease for Pavilions,\u201d Pustilnikov said.\n",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills has rejected a proposed builder\u2019s remedy project after allowing other projects in the enclave to proceed, citing concerns over socioeconomic segregation as a factor.\nThe Beverly Hills Planning Commission rejected the proposal from developer Crescent Heights to turn a currently empty lot at\n8844 Burton Way\ninto a\n26-story building\nwith 38 studio, two- and three-bedroom apartments, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. As part of its plan, the tower would have 22 units of affordable housing for extremely-low-income and moderate-income households in order to be eligible for the builder\u2019s remedy.\nDespite staff and the city attorney recommending approval, commissioners voted 3\u20132 to reject it, jumping on claims from Commissioner Gary Ross that the project violated anti-segregation laws by concentrating the affordable units on the lower floors.\nCrescent Heights\u2019 proposal was one of several\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects reluctantly accepted\nfor review after Beverly Hills didn\u2019t process them for more than a year. Unlike others that squeaked through, this one met fierce pushback.\nPrior to the Wednesday meeting where the city brought down the hammer on Crescent Heights\u2019 proposal, the developer reworked its plan to spread affordable units across more levels, trimming two stories off the height and offering translucent balcony designs to concerns about the building\u2019s size and privacy. Still, commissioners weren\u2019t convinced.\nThe design changes were contingent on an agreement for the City Council to not bring up the proposal for review and attempt to impose further conditions. The plan would have also been voided in the event of an appeal, which at least one neighbor vowed to do. As a result, a majority of commissioners were dissuaded from accepting a proposal with a contingency, citing opposition from neighbors and the scale of the project as reasons for their rejection.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the city of Beverly Hills must plan to build 3,104 new housing units by the end of the decade.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Suburban Glenview is taking a bold step into real estate, agreeing to spend more than $23 million to buy the vacant 56-acre former Signode industrial\ncampus\nand shape its redevelopment around community needs.\nThe village\u2019s board of trustees voted to acquire the property at 3600\u20133700 West Lake Avenue from Signode, which left in 2022 after moving its headquarters to Florida and operations to Roselle. Village officials described the deal as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine one of Glenview\u2019s largest redevelopment sites, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nPlans for the land are still in the early stages, but envision a mix of park space, sports fields, open space and community-oriented retail or recreational amenities. The\nvillage\nexpects to close on the purchase in February, paying with cash reserves drawn from various municipal funds.\nThe move marks a sharp turn from prior redevelopment attempts.\nIn 2020, Glenview blocked Dermody Properties\u2019 $24 million proposal for a three-building warehouse complex amid opposition to adding heavy truck traffic near residential neighborhoods.\nA subsequent concept calling for 138 homes also failed to gain traction. Jeff Brady, Glenview\u2019s community development director, said those concepts didn\u2019t fit the village\u2019s \u201cbest long-term interest.\u201d\nBy buying the land outright, the village gains control of the site\u2019s destiny amid a\nsuburban real estate market\nstruggling to repurpose vacant corporate campuses.\nDozens of similar sites across the region have gone industrial since the pandemic, as office demand cratered and warehouse absorption surged. Glenview, however, appears determined to favor open-space and civic uses over logistics or large-scale residential density.\nNot everyone is on board.\nSeveral residents questioned the wisdom of committing millions in taxpayer funds without a public referendum or detailed plan, with one resident asking why and when did the village get into the real estate speculation business.\nThe planning process is expected to begin in spring, with first-phase construction targeted for summer 2027.\nTrustee Adam Sidoti called it \u201cthe largest investment in this community since The Glen,\u201d a reference to the transformative redevelopment of the former Naval Air Station that remade central\nGlenview\ntwo decades ago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago\u2019s biggest hotels is trading hands in a deal that sheds light on the city\u2019s hospitality rebound and the\ndeep discounts\nstill shaping it.\nSuburban investor and IT executive Ketu Amin is under contract to buy The Westin Michigan Avenue Chicago for about $72 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing sources familiar with the deal. That\u2019s under $96,000 per key for the property at 909 North Michigan Avenue.\nThe seller of the 752-key property is Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, a Maryland-based REIT that\u2019s been marketing the hotel since last year.\nThe sale extends a string of bargain-basement deals downtown as rising rates and lagging business travel weigh on hotel values. The purchase price amounts to less than a 5 percent cap rate, a source told the outlet, but Amin declined to confirm.\nPebblebrook acquired the Westin in 2018 through its $715 million buyout of LaSalle Hotel Properties, valuing it then at about $156 million. Before that, LaSalle bought the property in 2006 for nearly $215 million and poured $49 million into upgrades including guest rooms, public space renovations and upgrades to building systems that began in 2012.\nPebblebrook sold the hotel\u2019s ground-floor retail space for $27 million last year, but the pending sale of the hotel itself would mark a painful write-down for the REIT.\nAmin\u2019s move follows a similar opportunistic play earlier this year, when one of his entities paid $28.3 million for the dual-branded Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites\nMag Mile\n, well below its pre-pandemic value. His Schaumburg-based IT firm VinaKom has helped bankroll a growing hospitality portfolio run through\nVinayaka Hospitality\n, managed by his wife, Komal Patel.\nThe group\u2019s holdings stretch from the Westin North Shore in Wheeling to multiple Marriott and Hilton-branded hotels around\nO\u2019Hare\nand Oak Brook.\nJLL brokers Adam McGaughy and John Nugent are marketing the Westin on Pebblebrook\u2019s behalf and previously pitched it as a redevelopment candidate.\nWhen its Marriott Westin franchise and management deals expire next year, a buyer could rebrand or even split the property into dual flags, as it includes a two aging highrises that opened about a decade apart: a 15-story west tower that opened in 1963 and an adjoining 26-story east tower completed in 1972.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A San Francisco developer must pay more than $1 million in fines after illegally excavating beneath hillside homes and lying to city officials.\nDeveloper Kevin O\u2019Connor has been ordered by San Francisco Superior Court Judge Garrett Wong to fork over nearly $1.1 million in civil penalties after digging under two Miraloma Park homes in a landslide zone without permits and repeatedly lying about it to city officials, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\n\u201cEvery material assertion that [O\u2019Connor] advanced in his testimony was either impeached by his words or contradicted by credible evidence,\u201d Wong wrote in the decision. \u201cThe evidence shows his proclivity for deceit and opportunity, even under oath.\u201d\nO\u2019Connor violated city building and planning codes, as well as California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law and State Housing Law, by digging under homes at 147 and 107 Marietta Drive in Miraloma Park to double square footage and add a retaining wall, the judge found. Wong also issued an injunction demanding O\u2019Connor address all remaining code violations to bring the properties into legal compliance.\nO\u2019Connor \u201cintentionally defrauded the City and put San Franciscans in danger\u201d while overseeing construction projects,\nCity Attorney David Chiu\nsaid in a statement.\nO\u2019Connor bought the two single-family homes with the intention of flipping them. In an effort to double the square-footage and add a retaining wall, he excavated in a\nlandslide\nhazard area that requires extra seismic review to ensure safety.\nThose illegal digs destabilized the hillside and compromised the property\u2019s foundation on three sides. It also damaged the adjacent property at 151 Marietta Drive, which shared a foundation with 147 Marietta.\n\u201cHe recklessly excavated under homes without a permit in order to turn a quick profit,\u201d City Attorney David Chiu\nsaid\nin a statement.\nTo try to offload the properties, O\u2019Connor allegedly put together \u201ca web of fraudsters who did his bidding to quickly flip these properties and turn a profit,\u201d Chiu said.\nThat group included former San Francisco Building Inspection Commission president Rodrigo Santos, who\nsettled a $1.4 million fraud case\nwith the city in July after serving 20 months in federal prison for bank fraud, honest services fraud, falsifying records and tax evasion.\nO\u2019Connor said he was not involved with the\ncorruption at the Department of Building Inspection\n, instead claiming he was a victim of it.\n\u201cEverything I did was under [Department of Building Inspection] scrutiny and all rules were followed,\u201d he told the Chronicle, acknowledging that he did excavate before a permit was granted. \u201cThe city is using me as a scapegoat and it is destroying me.\u201d\nO\u2019Connor plans to call for a new trial on claims of irregularities in the proceedings preventing a fair trial, errors in law, newly discovered evidence, misconduct and conflicts of interest, and excessive and unlawful penalties.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Success was never a guarantee, and it didn\u2019t happen overnight, but Miami\u2019s market is ripe for brokers seeking momentum.\nThat was the consensus among Danny Hertzberg, Margit Brandt and Dawn McKenna, some of Florida\u2019s top brokers in conversation at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Thursday. Each of them had already put years into their real estate careers by the time the pandemic triggered a boom in their respective markets: Miami, Palm Beach and Naples.\nThey were well-positioned to receive the flood of wealthy buyers, but in a panel discussion exploring how they became agents with $100-million-plus listings, they described more humble beginnings.\nBrandt\n, a Palm Beach agent with Premier Estate Properties who has closed more than $1 billion in deals since 2022, discussed cutting her teeth as a 21-year-old agent in New York too young to be taken seriously.\nHertzberg\n, the son of Miami real estate doyenne\nJill Hertzberg\n, told the story of pivoting from a legal career to real estate just in time for the global financial crisis to rock South Florida\u2019s market in 2009.\nMcKenna\npivoted from her career as a Chicago-based interior designer and today runs Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Dawn McKenna Group in Naples, Park City, Chicago, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and New Buffalo and Harbor Country in Michigan. Her team has closed nearly $800 million in sales this year, a volume that took years to build.\n\u201cFrom 2003 to 2017, I was just an agent with two assistants doing $150 million a year,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get nothing from me, get this: Just go for it.\u201d\nThe three brokers are now well versed in working at the absolute upper echelons of the luxury real estate market. Brandt brought the buyer in the\n$150 million sale of Palm Beach\u2019s Tarpon Island\nlast year. Hertzberg had the listing on a La Gorce Island assemblage consumer goods mogul Anand Khubani bought for\n$100 million\n. McKenna helped broker\na record $225 million\nsale in Naples in April, and has the listing for the Naples estate Gordon Pointe, which hit the market last year asking\n$295 million\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re off market making adjustments right now,\u201d she said of Gordon Pointe. \u201cI will tell you we\u2019ve had 26 showings\u2026 It\u2019s a cornucopia of people.\u201d\nSouth Florida\u2019s typical buyer demographic has expanded from Northeasterners, Midwesterners and Californians to include more international buyers from a greater range of territories, the agents said. With Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral victory in New York, the trio agreed another wave of wealthy buyers would make moves to South Florida, citing concerns about safety and quality of life.\nMcKenna noted that a New York client of hers who previously bought a $40 million condo with her was planning to tour homes with her in Naples after Thanksgiving. Brandt said sellers are already responding to the increasing demand.\n\u201cThe sellers are acutely aware. I had a lot of sellers be like, \u2018He won, we\u2019re increasing the price 20 percent,\u2019\u201d she said. But the Mamdani victory hasn\u2019t slammed the brakes on New York\u2019s market like Florida\u2019s brokers predicted, she said. \u201cI\u2019m talking to friends in New York who are still saying they\u2019re seeing contracts signed.\u201d\nHertzberg confirmed that within weeks of the June primary that anointed Mamdani as the Democratic candidate, a New York-based client of his who had a deposit down on a $10 million property canceled his contract and bought a home in Miami.\n\u201cWe all received a lot of calls yesterday,\u201d he said. But, \u201cmost of them were people venting.\u201d",

The family still owes about $10.1 million, according to court filings.\nStillwater is asking the court to authorize a public auction if the debt isn\u2019t repaid.\nThe nine-story, 31,000-square-foot building sits between Second and Third avenues and houses Sky Management, the firm that operates many of the Ohebshaloms\u2019 apartment holdings. Other tenants include Trooper Fitness and FiftyFour NYC, a bar mitzvah venue.\nThe property is 96 percent leased, boasting asking rents around $40 per square foot, according to CoStar data cited by Crain\u2019s.\nThe family has a history of skirting close to the edge with lenders and city regulators alike.\nIn 2022, Stillwater\nbrought a similar foreclosure action\nover the same property before striking a deal that extended the payoff date by two years. The Ohebshaloms have also racked up numerous city violations across their multifamily portfolio for elevator breakdowns and other maintenance issues.\nJonathan Ohebshalom, reached at Sky Management, declined to comment to the publication.\nThe Midtown property has changed hands \u2014 mostly within the family \u2014 over the years. Records show the Ohebshaloms acquired it in 2007 for $7.7 million through Majestic Realty Associates, then sold a 50 percent interest to Gemini Partners Realty for $7.3 million in 2016; Fred Ohebshalom was listed as manager of both entities.\nSterling National Bank originated the $12.6 million mortgage in 2018, which was later assigned to Stillwater after Webster Bank\u2019s merger with Sterling in 2022.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate industry experts pushed back on the theory that a bubble is forming in Miami that\u2019s about to burst.\n\u201cThis market is built on cash,\u201d said market analyst Ana Bozovic, founder of Analytics Miami, at\nThe Real Deal\u2019\ns Miami Real Estate Forum. Bozovic spoke on a panel about how developers can survive the market crunch in Miami in a conversation moderated by\nTRD\u2019s\nEditor-in-Chief Stuart Elliott.\nBozovic said a UBS report that named Miami as the most vulnerable city\nto a bubble\nwas an \u201cegregious misrepresentation of truth\u201d because it\u2019s such a heavy cash market.\n\u201cUsually when assets collapse, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a collapse. The bubble pops when the underlying assets can no longer sustain the debt, and it all goes away, kind of like a flammable house of cards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this setup.\u201d\nDan Kodsi, CEO of Royal Palm Companies, said Miami isn\u2019t overbuilt like it was in 2008.\n\u201cThe issue is we\u2019re building product that\u2019s expensive, and because of construction costs, when you\u2019re building high-rise especially, you have to sell it at a very high price per foot,\u201d Kodsi said.\nThe lack of affordable housing is pushing locals to markets like Orlando, Kodsi added.\n\u201cEvery part of Florida, you\u2019re seeing grow,\u201d he said.\nThe panelists also address the\nexpected wave of migration\nof New Yorkers to South Florida following Zohran Mamdani winning the mayoral race in New York.\n\u201cI think the expectation that you\u2019re going to see something immediately, like, the press keeps kind of glorifying like, \u2018oh, tomorrow, there\u2019s gonna be a million people moving here,\u2019\u201d said fellow speaker Brad Meltzer, president of Two Roads Development. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, but it\u2019s going to happen after a matter of time. Some people have families. They have kids. You don\u2019t just pick up and move tomorrow, but the investigation process is going to start to happen.\u201d\nKodsi and Meltzer both suggested resolutions ahead for separate projects they\u2019re involved in that are tied up in litigation.\nFor Two Roads, the Florida Supreme Court\nrecently denied the developer\na request for a rehearing in a condo buyout case involving the Biscayne 21 building in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, effectively ending the developer\u2019s legal options. The group of holdout owners, who Meltzer called \u201ca little bit greedy,\u201d successfully challenged the developer\u2019s amendment to lower the condo termination requirement once it had control over the association.\nMeltzer insisted the Edition Residences project that\u2019s planned for the site \u201cwill happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take a little bit more time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been discussions behind the scenes with that, but it\u2019ll get resolved. It has to resolve itself. When something is valuable enough, parties have to compromise like anything else in life, and there\u2019ll be a compromise that takes place, and everybody will feel that they can get a good deal, and we\u2019ll move on.\u201d\nKodsi is tied up in a\nforeclosure lawsuit\nover the Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter. He told the court in July he is working on a $390 million refinancing for the project.\nA court order bans Kodsi from talking about the lawsuit, but he said it\u2019s \u201con a path for starting construction again.\u201d\n\u201cThat ugly dumpling, let\u2019s say, is going to be a beautiful swan when she\u2019s built, a great project,\u201d Kodsi said.\n",

The price amounts to $9 million-plus per acre.\nAn entity tied to 4D Development and Investments founder\nDavid Pourbaba\n, was the seller.\nThe 235,000-square-foot site is at 4400 Pacific Boulevard. A data center from Prime Data Centers is under construction across the street.\nVernon has become a hotspot for data centers in recent years thanks to its electric utility structure that allows the city to offer power at lower prices than many other municipalities in the Los Angeles region.\nPrime Data Centers, for example, has already taken advantage. The Dallas-based firm\nopened a 243,000-square-foot data center\nin the city last November. Denver-based\ndata center developer CoreSite\nbought a 7-acre site in Vernon for $61.5 million last September.\nDigital Realty\u2019s move comes two years after the company floated a plan to\nreplace a parking garage at 727 Grand Avenue\nin downtown Los Angeles with a data center. Where that project stands is unclear.\nThe Klabin Company\u2019s Frank Schulz, Zach Middleton and Max Farkas represented Digital Realty in the deal, while Pacific Santa Fe Industrial was represented by David Brandt and Jake Poxon of Lee &amp; Associates.\nThe artificial intelligence sector has been\nraking in tens of billions of dollars\nin investment as data centers become attractive pieces of property across the country.\nDespite some fears of a potential AI bubble bursting, major data center users like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and\nMeta are ramping up their AI investments\n, dropping more money on centers rather than paring back investments out of caution.\nCapital expenditures from those large-scale users increased more than 18 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Long considered a linear slog, developing affordable housing just became a little more choose-your-own-adventure.\nBuilders of a 100 percent, publicly-funded project can seek approval from the Board of Standards and Appeals, rather than going through the city\u2019s land use review process.\nA rezoning that would add 30 percent more residential space in a medium-density district can go through a speedier review that bypasses the City Council.\nAnd the prospect of facing off with a City Council member who is sure to reject a project doesn\u2019t automatically mean a developer should abandon all hope.\nThe passage\nthis week\nof three housing ballot measures that create different avenues for approving housing projects and, in some cases, bypass or challenge the City Council\u2019s authority, significantly shifts the power dynamics around land-use decisions. Their effectiveness will hinge on several factors, including staffing levels at housing agencies, capital available for housing and the relationship between the next mayor and City Council leaders.\nBut developers, attorneys and officials are already thinking about what these changes mean for housing construction in the near- and long-term.\nTake it to the board\nOne of the measures replaces the mayoral veto with a three-person appeals board that can reverse City Council rejections. The board can only act on projects that add affordable housing and that only affect one borough.\nTypically, the City Council aligns with the local member on land-use issues, a\ntradition\nknown as member deference. Mayors rarely veto land-use decisions, knowing that a Council supermajority will likely overturn them.\nThe appeals board disrupts this dynamic, potentially encouraging developers to pursue projects in districts hostile to development.\nBut proponents say the appeals board doesn\u2019t mean developers will go from trying to win over local Council members to sidestepping them entirely.\n\u201cWho says it is easier to get three people to say yes?\u201d asked lobbyist Suri Kasirer.\nThe goal will remain trying to figure out how to get the City Council to a \u201cyes\u201d on a project, she said. Dismissing the local Council member and community concerns entirely also likely won\u2019t endear a developer to the mayor, borough president or City Council speaker. They too have to consider threats to reelection and maintaining a relationship with the Council.\n\u201cAnybody would be stupid not to take the local Council member seriously,\u201d she said.\nRachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, agreed that the appeals board likely won\u2019t be called upon very often. She believes it will instead push City Council members to reach a deal with developers before it gets to that point.\nKen Fisher, a land-use attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, said one of the biggest impacts of the appeals board is that it makes borough presidents more important to the process. Under the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, borough presidents serve an advisory role; their opinions on projects, while they may be influential, are not binding.\nBorough presidents may rejoice at this shift \u2014 in fact, most of them supported it. Their inclusion on the appeals board restores some of the authority these officials once had as part of the land use review process, when Ulurp ended with the city Board of Estimates. In 1989, that board was disbanded, and the City Council was given the final word on projects that go through Ulurp.\nFisher sees the borough president as the board\u2019s swing vote. If the City Planning Commission signs off on a rezoning, presumably, the proposal has the mayor\u2019s support. The City Council speaker, meanwhile, is going to be reluctant to overrule a local Council member, he said.\nThis might mean that developers who think they can win over the borough president will be more emboldened to move forward with a project.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a universe of projects that are stillborn because either the developers think they can never get it past the local Council member, or they met with the council member and learned that they won\u2019t support it,\u201d he said. \u201cThose projects may now have life.\u201d\nCity Council leaders have called the measures a\npower grab\nthat will prove dangerous beyond the next mayor, when the city \u201cinevitably\u201d has a mayor that is \u201cbad on housing, equity, and justice for communities,\u201d a spokesperson said. They, along with 32BJ SEIU and city construction unions, have argued that the measures deny Council members the ability to negotiate for deeper affordability and investments in their communities.\n\u201cThis will leave our city without the checks and balances of democracy to protect New Yorkers and ensure outcomes that prioritize them, not simply profits,\u201d a Council spokesperson said in a statement after the election.\nDeveloper David Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, said the appeals board may cause developers to take a second look at projects they thought unworkable, either because the local member opposed it or was likely to try to squeeze as much as possible out of the developer as a condition of approval.\n\u201cThe situation set up the developer to be tortured and extorted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole process will be less fraught.\u201d\nNeed for speed\nOne of the measures creates two \u201cfast-track\u201d options for affordable housing. The first option allows the Board of Standards and Appeals to sign off on zoning changes for publicly funded affordable housing. Such projects would not have to go through Ulurp.\nThe other applies to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Starting in October 2026, the city will release a report every five years identifying these districts.\nProjects in these areas will be eligible for a condensed Ulurp, which will end with City Planning Commission review, rather than the City Council.\nAnother measure creates the Expedited Land Use Review Procedure \u2014 or Elurp \u2014 for \u201cmodest\u201d housing projects. Such projects are defined as those in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent, or in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two.\nElurp follows a similar shortened review timeline as the \u201cfast-track\u201d and skips either City Council or City Planning review.\n\u201cThis is just the HOV lane in development,\u201d said Joy Construction\u2019s Eli Weiss, referring to carpool lanes. \u201cThe fast track is really just a response to getting costs down.\u201d\nJust like a carpool lane, the effectiveness of these ballot measures will depend on a number of factors, including availability of city subsidies and the ability of the city\u2019s housing agencies to move these projects along.\nThe future Mamdani administration will be tasked with implementing these measures and determining how to ensure their effectiveness. The mayor-elect has said that he plans to increase staffing at the city\u2019s housing agencies, and some saw his appointment of former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer as co-chair of his transition team as an encouraging sign that he will staff his administration with people dedicated to making these measures work.\nMyriad other factors outside this process also threaten the pace of construction, including the high costs of building, access to capital and litigation. Not to mention the measures do not shave time off of environmental review, which, along with pre-certification,\ncan add years\nto a project\u2019s timeline.\nThe ballot measures, with the exception of the fast-track option for projects built in the 12 community districts that have produced the least amount of housing, will go into effect once the election results have been certified. The Department of City Planning and the BSA will also need to draft rules for implementing various aspects of the ballot measures.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many projects currently in the pipeline will try to take advantage of the ballot measures. Developers who have already sunk time and money into going through Ulurp and are nearing the end may decide these alternative paths aren\u2019t worth abandoning their current track. Others may try to switch lanes.\nLonger term, some see the changes as potential boosts for smaller developers.\nMonadnock Development\u2019s Kirk Goodrich said the fast-track and Elurp options create an easier path for smaller or less-established developers to pursue affordable housing projects, by providing a faster timeline and, potentially, a clearer path to approval.\n\u201cI used to say to my team, \u2018Small isn\u2019t easy. Small is just small. So go big,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c[The fast-track] creates a scale that might be manageable for smaller developers.\u201d\n",

The list includes four public housing chiefs from across the country, the agency\u2019s chief of staff Kemena Brooks, and Burnett, whose candidacy has been bogged down by conflict-of-interest concerns.\nThe\nCHA\n\u2014 the nation\u2019s third-largest public housing authority \u2014 has been without a permanent head since Tracey Scott resigned last November.\nA national search launched soon after, with board chair\nMatthew Brewer\nnow saying a new CEO could be named by year\u2019s end. The board\u2019s last scheduled meeting of this year is Nov. 18, though Brewer said a special session could be called to finalize the decision.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has yet to approve\nconflict-of-interest waivers\nfor Burnett, whose decades in public office and role as a CHA voucher landlord have drawn objections. He and his wife have collected over $260,000 in rent payments from CHA vouchers since 2007.\nDue to the federal government shutdown, that review process is unlikely to wrap up in time to meet CHA\u2019s desired timeframe to fill the top spot.\nBurnett, who grew up in public housing, has said his \u201ccollaborative\u201d leadership style and personal connection to CHA residents make him an ideal fit. But for now, the agency appears intent on moving forward without him.\nAmong those vying for the role are Gregg Fortner of Alabama\u2019s Anniston Housing Authority, Jillian Baldwin of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Eugene Jones Jr., who ran the CHA from 2015 to 2019 and currently leads the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority. Jones\u2019 candidacy has support from CHA resident leaders, though not from all housing advocates. Keith Pettigrew, of Washington, D.C.\u2019s housing authority, was also listed but withdrew months ago.\nThe position comes with weighty responsibilities: overseeing more than 21,000 public housing units and 65,000 households, making the CHA Chicago\u2019s largest single housing owner. But the agency is navigating internal turbulence, with\nnine top executives\nexiting since August and federal scrutiny over Johnson\u2019s push to install Burnett.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Since the sale, Caroll had a lot of idle time on his hands, and the shotgun incident wasn\u2019t the first or last time that he was in the news for the wrong reasons in recent years.\n\u201cSitting in my pool was not good for me,\u201d Carroll told\nThe Real Deal\npublisher Amir Korangy on Thursday. \u201cStarting in March of 2024 I went into a full blown manic attack. And frankly, there\u2019s a lot of it [that] I don\u2019t even remember. I look back on it and I see things that I posted or I read articles, and I cringe.\u201d\nAfter Miami Beach Police forced Carroll into a three-day mental health evaluation and temporarily seized his firearms, he got into more trouble a few months later in Los Angeles. He was charged with displaying a loaded firearm in public and evading a police officer in an incident that involved him being filmed by a TV news helicopter running from Los Angeles cops.\nIn November of last year, Florida state prosecutors dropped a felony aggravated stalking charge against Carroll in his native Tampa. A month earlier,\nCarroll\nwas arrested in Wyoming on an outstanding warrant that he had allegedly violated a 15-day temporary restraining order to stay away from his ex-wife, Lindsey Truex. Prosecutors determined that phone calls he made to Truex occurred after the restraining order had expired.\nIn April,\nCarroll\nagreed to undergo mental health counseling for two years, in exchange for prosecutors dismissing the charges.\nCarroll\nspoke to Korangy at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum about his past controversies, finding out he had bipolar disorder that had gone undiagnosed for years, and his efforts to restore his reputation as he looks to get back in the real estate game in 2027 once a noncompete agreement with RMR expires.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come out of the gate in 2027,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty positive I can do $500 million to $1 billion worth of acquisitions. This is the phase I call, \u2018waving my ass around.\u2019\u201d\nCaroll\u2019s real estate career took off in 2010 when he started to raise venture capital from institutional investors like private equity firm Carlyle, he told Korangy. \u201cWe would buy $1 billion a year,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019d go do a victory lap in New York and [tell potential new investors], \u2018I\u2019m making so much money with Carlyle, you really should partner with me.\u2019\u201d\nGoing forward, he is confident he will convince potential new investors to join him, despite his notorious past, Carroll said.\n\u201cSmart investors invest to make money, and I\u2019m a proven moneymaker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never easy for me. I was this kid from Tampa that didn\u2019t go to college, and that had been arrested before. The good thing is I\u2019ve never been arrested or in trouble for anything based on integrity, never anything financially related, never anything that\u2019s affected my business.\u201d",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank is reducing its exposure to New York City multifamily properties. In the process, it\u2019s reducing its exposure to Steve Croman, too.\nFlagstar sold notes with an original principal of $247 million to an affiliate of Bellwether Asset Management, PincusCo\nreported\n. The deal includes 38 loans tied to 49 of Croman\u2019s properties, accounting for about 680 total units.\nAll of the debt was originated by Flagstar\u2019s predecessor, New York Community Bank, between 2015 and 2020. Properties are in a wide array of Manhattan neighborhoods, including the West Village, Murray Hill, Gramercy, Kips Bay, East Village and Alphabet City.\nCentennial Bank helped finance the loan purchase for Bellwether, which has a portfolio consisting of 138 million square feet worth of office, industrial, retail, hotel, multifamily and residential lot space.\nFlagstar and Croman have had their differences. In July, Flagstar\nsued\nCroman, claiming the property owner owed $29.6 million related to three Stanton Street properties on the Lower East Side.\nAt the time, Croman was facing seven active foreclosure suits seeking about $51.4 million in principal from Croman and his companies. A temporary receiver had been appointed in five of the cases.\nCroman has also faced\nlegal action\nfrom his former office landlord, who alleges the property owner failed to pay more than $1 million in rent on a Noho office space. He is also\nbeing sued by his father,\nwho has called him a \u201cfraudster\u201d and is seeking to dissolve their partnerships.\nCroman was once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords and served eight months in prison in 2018 after being convicted of mortgage and tax fraud related to his multifamily buildings.\nThe deal closed around the same time Flagstar reported its\nthird-quarter earnings\n. The company has nearly $9.59 billion in loans tied to heavily rent-stabilized buildings on the books, down about $324 million from the last time the bank\nreported\nits numbers three months ago.\nAbout 60 percent of Flagstar\u2019s loans to New York City multifamily buildings are tied to heavily rent-stabilized properties. Of those loans, about 45 percent have financial red flags, according to the bank.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The developer purchased the former site of the St. Columba campus in August for\n$48.25 million\n.\nThe towers are slated to hold 197 rental units \u2014 98 in one and 99 in the other \u2014 and each will span roughly 100,000 gross square feet, according to Timber Equities principal Mitch Perle.

Timber Equities completed work on its 60-unit\nluxury rental building in Inwood\nthis year on the parking lot site once owned by drug kingpin Manuel Geovanny Rodriguez-Perez.\nIt\u2019s been a big year for religious conversions, of the residential real estate variety.\nKalel Companies and the Masjid Abdul Muhsi Khalifah mosque on Thursday\nannounced plans for a 94,000-square-foot\nmixed-use building with 144 senior housing units in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\nIn May, The Vanbarton Group closed its acquisition of the Catholic Church\u2019s former Manhattan headquarters at\n1011 First Avenue for $103 million\n.

Since the sale, Caroll had a lot of idle time on his hands, and the shotgun incident wasn\u2019t the first or last time that he was in the news for the wrong reasons in recent years.\n\u201cSitting in my pool was not good for me,\u201d Carroll told\nThe Real Deal\npublisher Amir Korangy on Thursday. \u201cStarting in March of 2024 I went into a full blown manic attack. And frankly, there\u2019s a lot of it [that] I don\u2019t even remember. I look back on it and I see things that I posted or I read articles, and I cringe.\u201d\nAfter Miami Beach Police forced Carroll into a three-day mental health evaluation and temporarily seized his firearms, he got into more trouble a few months later in Los Angeles. He was charged with displaying a loaded firearm in public and evading a police officer in an incident that involved him being filmed by a TV news helicopter running from Los Angeles cops.\nIn November of last year, Florida state prosecutors dropped a felony aggravated stalking charge against Carroll in his native Tampa. A month earlier,\nCarroll\nwas arrested in Wyoming on an outstanding warrant that he had allegedly violated a 15-day temporary restraining order to stay away from his ex-wife, Lindsey Truex. Prosecutors determined that phone calls he made to Truex occurred after the restraining order had expired.\nIn April,\nCarroll\nagreed to undergo mental health counseling for two years, in exchange for prosecutors dismissing the charges.\nCarroll\nspoke to Korangy at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum about his past controversies, finding out he had bipolar disorder that had gone undiagnosed for years, and his efforts to restore his reputation as he looks to get back in the real estate game in 2027 once a noncompete agreement with RMR expires.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come out of the gate in 2027,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty positive I can do $500 million to $1 billion worth of acquisitions. This is the phase I call, \u2018waving my ass around.\u2019\u201d\nCaroll\u2019s real estate career took off in 2010 when he started to raise venture capital from institutional investors like private equity firm Carlyle, he told Korangy. \u201cWe would buy $1 billion a year,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019d go do a victory lap in New York and [tell potential new investors], \u2018I\u2019m making so much money with Carlyle, you really should partner with me.\u2019\u201d\nGoing forward, he is confident he will convince potential new investors to join him, despite his notorious past, Carroll said.\n\u201cSmart investors invest to make money, and I\u2019m a proven moneymaker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never easy for me. I was this kid from Tampa that didn\u2019t go to college, and that had been arrested before. The good thing is I\u2019ve never been arrested or in trouble for anything based on integrity, never anything financially related, never anything that\u2019s affected my business.\u201d",

        "content": "Multifamily developers Bruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck say South Florida needs more housing, but skittish equity investment is among the many barriers to entry.\nThe trio, who spoke during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025, pushed back on the notion the tri-county region is struggling with a supply overhang due to hefty completions in recent years. Instead, demand is high and supply is low for the highest quality apartments, the developers said.\nLast year, a\nrecord 18,600 apartments\nwere completed in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group. Developers started construction of another 14,515 units in the year that ended Sept. 30, outpacing construction starts during the same period of last year.\nThe notion that developers are saturating South Florida has been an ongoing theme in the region\u2019s history, Lubeck, CEO of Tampa-based American Landmark, said at the \u201cToo Much, Too Fast? Rethinking South Florida\u2019s Apartment Boom\u201d panel hosted by\nTRD\ncommercial real estate reporter Francisco Alvarado.\n\u201cFor the last 10 years \u2026 they said, \u2018It\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt.\u2019 But it\u2019s really not overbuilt,\u201d Lubeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly ebb and flow in the ability to raise rents and, of course, construction costs and the like. But overall, it\u2019s all about job growth and population growth.\u201d\nAnd the tri-county region has both residential and employment growth, the panelists said. Roughly 80,000 households are projected to move to South Florida in the next five years, with 40 percent of them expected to rent, according to Menin, founding principal of Miami-based Crescent Heights.\n\u201cWe know that our nation is under-supplied in housing,\u201d Menin said.\nAmerican Landmark subsidiary Electra America and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are redeveloping a portion of Cutler Bay\u2019s Southland Mall into\nSouth Place City Center\nwith roughly 5,000 apartments, a hotel, medical offices, retail on outparcels and a community amphitheater. They are renovating a portion of the existing mall and demolishing some of the retail buildings, including Sears and Kmart.\nCrescent Heights completed the 40-story, 588-unit\nForma Miami\napartment tower in Edgewater last year. The building, which is at least 97 percent leased, is billed by developers as a premier quality tower setting a new standard for the area. This is the first of six towers on 9 contiguous acres Crescent owns, Menin said.\nRutter is co-founder of Oak Row Equities, which has two multifamily towers under construction in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, and this year completed the mixed-use\nWynwood Plaza\nwith 509 apartments.\nMultifamily analysts and leasing companies say South Florida\u2019s hefty building completions are\nconcentrated\nin top Miami areas such as Edgewater and Wynwood, or exactly where Oak Row is developing. But Rutter countered the idea that these areas are over-supplied, arguing the issue is a lack of top-quality apartments that are in high demand.\n\u201cThere was a big wave of supply that came online between 2018 and call it 2021, and the vast majority of that was low-rise. Maybe some of the corners were cut to get projects out of the ground, quickly delivered [with] very small units,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThe renter pool has grown more sophisticated.\u201d\nAt Wynwood Plaza, which Rutter described as \u201cunquestionably the best\u201d building in Wynwood, demand is strong, with leasing velocity of about 35 units per month, he said. Yet, he conceded Oak Row is offering a month free to incentivize leasing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s other projects that have just delivered surrounding us. Of course, there are some concessions in the market. That\u2019s marketing,\u201d he said, adding this will probably be phased out once the building is 75 percent leased.\nThe true issue for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market is skittish equity, the panelists said, again arguing that only top sponsors and projects in premier neighborhoods can get investment.\nDebt markets are \u201crobust,\u201d but investment has dried in \u201cthe traditional pure play common [limited partner] equity, Rutter said, adding that may not be a bad thing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to quell supply naturally, and then institutional capital markets are going to open up again, cycle back in.\u201d\nThe trio differed in their views of developing in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\nPalm Beach County has prospered with the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of corporate moves and wealth in-migration, but it\u2019s more difficult to justify development of high-end apartments in Fort Lauderdale, Rutter said. Because construction costs are so expensive, Oak Row would have to charge the same rents as it does in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\n\u201cI can\u2019t extrapolate why you are going to get that in Fort Lauderdale,\u201d he said.\nLubeck is more open to suburban areas such as west Broward, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens.\n\u201cI am very concerned about overbuilding on the side of the river\u201d in Fort Lauderdale, he said, referring to the New River.\nIn September, Crescent Heights\u2019 Russell Galbut, through his GFO Investments, and InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance paid\n$73 million\nfor the\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\n, with plans to redevelop the mall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning several thousand units,\u201d Menin said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have picked up just any site. But this is a placemaking opportunity.\u201d\nMenin, who lives in Manhattan, also offered a more tempered view on the consistent topic of discussion at the forum of whether Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win will prompt an influx of New Yorkers to South Florida.\n\u201cPeople love Miami. They love New York. There\u2019s a similar DNA to the kind of people that are attracted to both markets. \u2026 I think people are going to continue to move back and forth,\u201d Menin said. \u201cI think we have to take a little bit of a wait and see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Housing demolition in San Francisco has been exceedingly rare over the last decade-plus, averaging out to about 18 units per year since 2012. City planners credit this to what they recently called \u201csome of the strongest demolition and\ntenant protection\ncontrols in the country.\u201d\nThose controls are now poised to become even stronger.\nThe city\u2019s planning commission greenlit a tenant protection omnibus this week that aims to further discourage residential demolitions and require more from landlords and developers whose projects could displace existing tenants. The proposal, known as the tenant protection ordinance, is headed to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for a final vote.\nIn classic San Francisco fashion, the proposal takes existing state law and enhances it. California\u2019s Housing Crisis Act of 2019 already prohibits any net loss of rent-controlled or affordable apartments. If a redevelopment project requires the demolition of a property\u2019s\naffordable\nor\nrent-controlled\napartments, they are required to build at least as many units, with at least as many bedrooms.\nIf passed, San Francisco\u2019s rules would require each of those replacement units to have the same number of full bathrooms, and at least 90 percent of the square footage. As with state law, the replacement units must remain as affordable as the originals.\nThe proposal also expands protection to more tenants.\nState law only affords tenant protections to those who live in a unit when the property owner submits a development application. Tenant protections include rights such as the ability to remain in a property for up to 6 months prior to demolition, relocation benefits, first refusal on replacement units, and the right to return if property owner changes course and returns the original units to the rental market.\nSan Francisco\u2019s new rules would expand those protections to tenants who have vacated the property due to a capital improvement project, have left the property within the last five years due to harassment or a non-compliant buyout, or tenants displaced within the last five years by an owner who decided to move back into the property and take it off the rental market.\nProperty owners would need to inform tenants of the protections, and tenants would also be granted a right of private action against a property owner or developer who violates requirements.\nThe proposal arrives against the backdrop of what many see as a looming upzoning in neighborhoods across the city.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\n\u2014 aimed at making room for 82,000 state-mandated units by 2031 \u2014 is plodding through the approval process.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nrecently signed SB 79\n, Sacramento\u2019s marquee housing bill this session, which could upzone properties within a half-mile of transit stops as soon as next summer.\nWhere talks of rezoning increase, fears around displacement often follow.\nAhead of casting their votes, commissioners celebrated the proposal. Commissioner Derek Braun called it \u201ca great day\u201d and Commissioner Kathrin Moore said the ordinance represented \u201cone of the most collaborative efforts I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u201d\nCommissioner Gilbert Williams said he welcomed the protections, but said his vote came \u201cwith a heavy heart.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of vulnerable tenants out there, and it\u2019s very unfortunate that we\u2019re in this situation,\u201d Williams said, referencing the proposed upzoning throughout the city. \u201cOur residents deserve a lot better than what they\u2019re being faced with here.\u201d",

        "content": "Developer Edgardo Defortuna and brokerage head Craig Studnicky said the foreign buyers they work with have not been deterred by the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n\u201cThey already have their visa, their status or they already own property here, and they\u2019re trying to [purchase] something better, bigger,\u201d\nDefortuna\n, CEO of Miami-based Fortune International Group, said at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum on Thursday.\nBut he said the shutdown has stalled anyone needing clearance from the consulate.\nForeign buyers\nare still very active\nin South Florida, both panelists said. Mexicans and Brazilians are leading in higher-priced purchases, while\nColombians\nare the top buyers for investment properties in the $1 million to $2.5 million range.\nStudnicky, co-founder and CEO of Aventura-based ISG World and RelatedISG Realty, said Latin Americans are increasingly looking at Broward County, specifically Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.\nThe\nbuyer pool\nhas shifted compared to before the pandemic, from 65 to 70 percent foreign buyers and 30 to 35 percent domestic buyers, to the opposite, Defortuna said.\nAlso a big factor that is happening today is that most of the Latin American currencies have appreciated versus the dollar, which is very, very unusual,\u201d he added. \u201cTypically, the Latin American currencies lose value versus the dollar. In the last six months, pretty much all the currencies in Latin America have appreciated versus the dollar, and that makes it very attractive for them, because they know that it\u2019s temporary, and they know that they should act now, because it\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\nDomestic buyers have dominated the resale market, versus foreign buyers who are more attracted to new developments.\n\u201cThese buildings take a long time to build, and when they\u2019re moving here in the next year or two, [U.S. buyers] simply cannot wait,\u201d Studnicky said.\nForeigners are also doubling down on South Florida real estate as private equity investors in new developments. Defortuna said he used to raise money for projects via hedge funds or New York-based real estate funds.\nPart of the\nlatest rush is through EB-5\napproved projects, Defortuna said. Under the federal program, investors and their families receive visas for financing a development that creates a minimum number of U.S. jobs.\n\u201cDemand has been incredible,\u201d Defortuna said. \u201cBefore, EB-5 used to be mainly Chinese or the Far East, but now the Latin American buyer really understands the process.\u201d\nThe speakers also touched on the effect that Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory in the New York mayoral race could have on South Florida real estate. While many Florida real estate agents and brokers predict a mass exodus, others are more measured about what to expect.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to uproot my life, my business, my friends, my family, my kids in school, when they have all their friends, because of some 34-year-old kid, without giving New York City a chance to punch back,\u201d Studnicky said. \u201cNew York\u2019s got a spine. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say we\u2019re going to get this huge wave of people from New York, and I think the comparable in their heads or in their hearts is what happened five years ago during Covid. Slow down. You\u2019re going to get a bump. But I think you\u2019re exaggerating the bump.\u201d\n",

The proposal comes from Hawthorne-based\nLAcarGuy and its CEO Mike Sullivan\n; Toyota of Hollywood was founded in 1957 and is a subsidiary of LAcarGuy, which has 13 auto dealers across Los Angeles County owned by the Sullivan family.\nThe site spans 3.7 acres and would consist of high-rise and low-rise structures including 350 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, 136,000 square feet of offices, and about 22,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. Houston-based developer Hines is part of the development team.\nThe project, designed by OfficeUntitled, would feature a 35-story residential tower rising 419 feet, a six-story office building, and low-rise residential structures that would seemingly create a townhome-populated, village-style environment. Between the buildings would be about 23,500 square feet of publicly accessible open space designed by landscape architect Relm, including a new plaza opening up to Hollywood Boulevard.\nThe\nPlanning Commission\ntook up two appeals against the project before ultimately upholding its decision to advance it. One was from a coalition of labor unions known as CREED L.A. (Coalition for Responsible Equitable Economic Development Los Angeles), which argued that the project\u2019s environmental impact report didn\u2019t consider several potential hazards that could impact future site occupants. The other was from the owner of an adjacent property, which appealed to the Commission to block the project due to its potential to obscure a cell tower and billboard on his property.\nThe project has gotten some support from business organizations such as the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, as well as building trades unions such as the Western States Regional Council of Carpenters.\nA timeline for completion of the project hasn\u2019t been confirmed after the appeal process, though in 2023, the plan was to break ground in 2026 and finish work in 2029, Urbanize\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Some of Chicagoland\u2019s most-expensive homes sales this year were in Winnetka, including a record-breaking\n$31.3 million deal\n.\nA Winnetka office is \u201clong overdue\u201d for the brokerage, Mawicke said in a LinkedIn post.\nThe firm sought Mawicke out when it was looking to expand its North Shore presence, said\nMark Pasquesi\n, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s president of real estate services and managing broker for Lake Forest and Winnetka.\nSales in the ritzy suburbs\nare dominated by @properties and Compass, which hold a large share of the area\u2019s listings, but other brokerages are taking their shots in the North Shore.\nPeter Cummins\n, also a former @properties agent, recently jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new North Shore team. And Janice Corley\u2019s\nRE/MAX Premier\nbought a handful of offices from Compass in the North Shore to kickstart business there. Compass sold offices in cities where @properties also had a presence as part of its purchase of the local brokerage last year.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s is getting into the mix with plans to open offices in Winnetka, Lake Forest and Glenview in the coming months.\nThe Lake Forest office, at 1050 North Western Avenue, will open this winter, Pasquesi said. The Winnetka and Glenview offices are expected to open next year. Pasquesi was brought on in March to manage the Lake Forest and Winnetka offices.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s has agents that sell in the North Shore, out of its office in Evanston.\nThe brokerage plans to compete with @properties and Compass by leaning into its boutique, luxury brand, rather than building a large agent roster, Pasquesi said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going into this intending to have the most agents or be No. 1 in market share,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to compete on size, we\u2019re focused on identifying and curating the best team of advisors.\u201d\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s is a franchise of Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate, a subsidiary of Anywhere Real Estate, which is set to come under the ownership of Compass if its plan to purchase Anywhere is approved by regulators. Franchises of Anywhere\u2019s brands are expected to remain independent under the merger.\n",

        "content": "The Ismaili Center Houston \u2014 the first in the United States \u2014 is officially open after many years of planning and development.\nThe long-anticipated cultural and religious complex debuted Nov. 6 with a ceremony led by\nHis Highness Prince Rahim Aga Khan V\nand\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire\n, marking a major milestone for both the city and the global Ismaili Muslim community, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project cost wasn\u2019t reported, but a state filing in 2021 pegged it at $176.2 million, or $1,175 per square foot for a project that was planned with a two-story parking structure.\nSet on 11 acres at 2323 Allen Parkway at Montrose Boulevard, the 150,000-square-foot complex is meant to serve not only as a place of worship but also as a public gathering space for people of all faiths.\n\u201cThis building may be called an Ismaili Center, but it is not here for Ismailis only. It is for all Houstonians,\u201d Prince Rahim said at the opening, calling the center a space for \u201cknowledge, reflection and dialogue.\u201d\nThe cooperative nature of the rollout in Houston stands in stark contrast to the\nepic fight state leaders picked\nthis year with\nEPIC City\n, a Muslim-led master-planned community north of Dallas.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission settled a\nFair Housing Act\ncomplaint against Community Capital Partners, the developer of EPIC City, in September. The agency dismissed the complaint after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and compliance reporting, while the developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nThe Houston project fulfills the vision of the late Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, who first purchased the site in 2006 and championed the idea of an American Ismaili Center before his death earlier this year.\nDesigned by London-based architect Farshid Moussavi, in collaboration with landscape architect Thomas Woltz of\nNelson Byrd Woltz\n, the center aims to embody the Ismaili philosophy of harmony between people, place and nature. The Washington, D.C.-based Aga Khan Foundation USA oversaw development, with Omaha\u2019s DLR Group serving as architect of record and McCarthy Building Companies as general contractor.\nThe center is framed by 9 acres of gardens, shaded terraces and water features. The building\u2019s triangular fa\u00e7ade doubles as a thermal and light filter, casting patterned sunlight across custom concrete floors that echo the geometric traditions of Islamic design. The theme continues throughout the interior, from perforated wooden walls inscribed in Kufic script to ceilings that conceal structural beams and air ducts behind intricate triangular screens.\nThe centerpiece is the prayer hall, a column-free space nearly the size of two basketball courts, able to accommodate 1,500 worshipers.\nIts orientation toward Mecca required rotating the structure 45 degrees off the site\u2019s grid, inspiring the triangular motif repeated throughout. Above it sits a grand veranda \u2014 or eivan \u2014 intended for weddings and public events, in keeping with Persian palace traditions.\nThe Ismaili Center joins six others worldwide, in London, Vancouver, Lisbon, Dubai, Dushanbe and Toronto.\nHouston, home to the country\u2019s largest Ismaili Muslim population at roughly 40,000, was a natural choice for the first U.S. site, center spokesperson Omar Samji said. The project\u2019s LEED-seeking design also reflects Houston\u2019s growing identity as a global city that merges culture, faith and sustainability.\nWhitmire called the complex a \u201cbeacon of light\u201d for the city\u2019s diverse communities.\n\u201cThe Ismaili Center truly reflects the best of Houston\u2019s spirit: our diversity, our compassion, and our commitment to community,\u201d Whitmire said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Social media can be a very powerful tool, but simply chasing likes or trying to go \u201cviral\u201d won\u2019t do anything to help a real estate professional\u2019s career, panelists warned during a discussion on the business of digital marketing during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Forum on Thursday.\nMichael Ruiz, president and CEO of\nLegendary Productions\n, a company in Miami and Austin that promotes\nluxury homes\n, said being obnoxious or shocking might please \u201csomeone in another country who is sitting in their underwear liking a video,\u201d but it won\u2019t do anything to help close a deal.\n\u201cIf I were a real estate agent\u2026 [I\u2019d look] at the top five, top 10 people who are actually selling and making money. They\u2019re not dancing on tables or doing those skits like whatever-her-name-is does in Tampa,\u201d said Ruiz, who has at least 500,000 followers on Legendary\u2019s Instagram, a highly viewed home tour YouTube channel. \u201cThey\u2019re presenting their properties in a professional manner and presenting themselves in a way that separates them from\u2026 the masses. So, the reality is, these people who are selling are going to continue to sell, and the people that are doing all this trendy stuff are going to fall out eventually.\u201d\nThe person from Tampa that Ruiz referred to was Breanna Banaciski, also known as Tampa Bre, a real estate agent in the Tampa metro area affiliated with Realty One Group Advantage who makes sarcastic humorous videos of properties on Instagram and Tiktok that have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\u201cShe got a big write-up in the New York Times a few weeks ago,\u201d said\nTRD\nreporter Kate Hinsche, the panel\u2019s moderator. \u201cYou might know her tagline. \u2018This house has more bush than my mom in the \u201880s.\u2019\u201d\nBut Glennda Baker, president and CEO of Atlanta-based Glennda Baker &amp; Associates, said she didn\u2019t find Banaciski\u2019s video shorts amusing.\n\u201cYeah, she makes my head spin around and snot fly out of my nose,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe sell homes that are usually people\u2019s single largest asset. We sell homes where people live their lives and bring their families and bring their friends and create milestones. And the mere fact that someone would be so disrespectful to that home, to that property, makes me violent. I\u2019m sorry, I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that. But it just, it really angers me. It is such a poor reflection of our industry. We are professionals. We get paid a lot of money to be professional. The worst agents are highly overpaid, and the best agents are highly undervalued, and when someone like that gets a following or gets spotlighted that scares the hell out of me.\u201d\nThe content \u201ceveryone in this room\u201d should be focused on is \u201ccreating content that is valuable to the consumer,\u201d added Baker, who has 875,000 followers on TikTok and 327,000 followers on Instagram.\nBaker, who has worked in real estate for more than 30 years, said she started creating content on social media in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t until 2020, after she hired a videographer, that her standing in social media grew. She now spends about four hours each month shooting 30 to 50 unscripted evergreen videos for days she is unable to post live, or at all.\n\u201cThe ideas come to me throughout the month. I have Google Forms on the homepage of my phone, and when I get an idea, I open up my phone, I put the idea in there. Then, when I sit with my videographer, I open my laptop and we go down the list,\u201d Baker said. \u201c[It\u2019s] really very structured because I post a video every day.\u201d\nThose clips can be stories about what it took to close a house, giving advice on real estate, or \u201cthe good, the bad, and the ugly\u201d stories, such as chasing a rat out of an attic and \u201ccleaning up the shit pellets\u201d or venting about a bad inspection.\n\u201cI do say bad words, and that may not be professional, but I\u2019m weeding out the riffraff by doing that\u2026cause if you\u2019re going to do business with me, and you think you\u2019re going to get somebody who\u2019s all buttoned up, you probably are looking in the wrong spot,\u201d she said, adding that she sold 27 houses on Tinder.\nAlyssa Morgan,\nfounder and senior agent of Miami Beach-based The Inside Network, said she uses social media to not only showcase her properties, but also to show pieces of her life, such as dinner with her husband, doing Pilates or going to a Mommy and Me class. \u201cMy goal with my [Instagram] page is to make you feel like you know me before you even know me, so I really am posting throughout my day, and it\u2019s just like what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nMorgan, who has 22,000 followers on Instagram, does this so people \u201cfeel comfortable enough to reach out to me\u201d about properties.\nIt\u2019s also important to \u201ctag\u201d places and people whenever possible when posting on Instagram, added Ruiz, who has collaborated with Morgan.\n\u201cTag, tag, tag everything you do\u2026. because then she reposts, I repost, she reposts, everybody starts seeing it. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\u201cA little trick that I used to do when I first started is I would get a listing, let\u2019s say at the\nCarillon\n, then I would go through the geotag and reach out to everyone that tagged themselves and send them my listing,\u201d Morgan later added. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like how I built my Miami followers.\u201d\nMorgan said she\u2019s managed to get listings, find buyer leads and close deals from her Instagram audience and followers.\nAnd that\u2019s the whole purpose of social media, to help create your own brand and bring value and visibility for your clients\u2019 homes, Baker said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about virality and vanity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not over here being a comedian who is trying to sell real estate to create content, I\u2019m creating content to sell real estate.\u201d",

        "content": "The South Side apartment building that was subject to a controversial federal raid last month has been officially deemed too unsafe for tenants to continue living in.\nCook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton issued an order Nov. 7 to appoint a receiver to the 7500 South South Shore Drive property and requested that the receiver, Friedman Real Estate, help the remaining tenants relocate.\n\u201cThe conditions are just ridiculous,\u201d a tenant said at the Nov. 7 receivership hearing. \u201cThere is sewage on both corners of the first floor. Maintenance doesn\u2019t do anything. The security is just crazy, no doors are secure and anyone can just walk in.\u201d\nAbout half a dozen tenants testified about the conditions of the property at the hearing. Seaton ordered that their names and unit numbers not be shared publicly.\nAfter hundreds of agents from the FBI, ATF and ICE led a massive overnight raid on the South Shore building last month, many tenants voluntarily moved out.\nThe Sept. 30 operation drew national attention for its intensity as well as criticism from local officials who called the tactics heavy-handed and questioned if it violated the rights of tenants who were detained temporarily but not ultimately arrested.\nThe operation yielded 37 arrests, some of which the Department of Homeland Security noted were for drug trafficking and weapons charges while others were for immigration violations. Additional details on the arrests have been scarce and records requests from\nThe Real Deal\nfor further information have been denied or not returned.\nAmid an escalating legal-back-and-forth between Wells Fargo and the building\u2019s owner, a little-known Wisconsin-based investor named Trinity Flood, the raid thrust the South Side building\u2019s longstanding troubles into the spotlight.\nWells Fargo, acting as a trustee on behalf of bond holders, filed a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit against Flood in April, claiming she was behind on mortgage payments tied to the South Shore building as well as several others across Chicago and the U.S.\nThough Flood initially fought back against Wells Fargo\u2019s attempts to have a receiver appointed to the property, her attorney said at the Nov. 7 hearing that they were no longer opposing the motion. He did, however, say that they reserved the right to oppose the appointment of a receiver at any of Flood\u2019s other properties.\nSince the raid, between 30 to 40 tenants still live at the 13-unit property. Several of them told Seaton at the Nov. 7 hearing that they would like to move out and that it continues to be subject to vandalism and trespassing. Multiple tenants testified that they would have moved out already if they had the financial means to do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlivable right now due to the ICE raid, the immigrants, the Venezuelans and the flooding,\u201d one tenant said, though it was unclear if the tenant meant that migrants do or do not still currently occupy the building. \u201cI lost a lot of stuff due to the raid. It\u2019s just unbearable right now.\u201d\nAcknowledging that it may be difficult for the tenants to find housing during the holiday season and without financial assistance, Seaton said the hazardous conditions at the property are still too severe to allow anyone to continue living there.\nA broken elevator, a potential gas leak, threat of carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty boilers, an insufficient number of working carbon monoxide detectors and significant electrical wiring issues were all cited as major causes for concern from city inspectors and the judge.\n\u201cThe court has some real concerns about the electrical problems,\u201d Seaton said. \u201cIt is like a trap, waiting for a fire.\u201d\nShe ordered that the receiver begin working on resolving safety issues as soon as possible and search for programs available to help tenants with relocation costs.\nSeaton also gave the receiver authority to begin the eviction process for squatters reported at the property, which is a notoriously difficult legal procedure in Illinois. A recent change to state law to improve that process\ndoes not take effect until the new year.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the only tenant left on this floor that isn\u2019t a squatter,\u201d said one tenant, adding that there appear to be squatters on every floor of the five-story building.\nAnother tenant alleged trespassers have vandalized the property and possibly used it as a place to engage in drug dealing and prostitution.\nBefore the raid, the building was cited for numerous code violations from the city of Chicago and city inspectors noted over the summer that the property manager, Corey Oliver of Strength in Management, was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nDuring another hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019 receivership request that took place shortly after the Sept. 30 raid, Oliver said he had hired armed security guards to patrol the building from 6PM to 6AM nightly.\nAt the time, Seaton acknowledged Oliver\u2019s efforts to improve conditions at the property and held off on appointing a receiver. Instead, she ordered a follow-up inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing to reconsider the issue Nov. 7.\nShe also asked that tenants attend the Nov. 7 hearing to provide their perspective on the conditions and tell the court whether or not they wanted to move out. Though the overall conditions would dictate her final decision, Seaton said she would also consider tenants\u2019 willingness to move in her ruling.\nAt the Nov. 7 hearing, tenants revealed that the security guards provided little help to the building and were no longer employed there.\n\u201cI am sure they were disgusted by being here,\u201d a tenant said of the security guards. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even sit in the building, they sat at the entrance or in their cars.\u201d\nOliver confirmed he had fired the security guards because they had not adequately protected the building and allowed vandalism to take place while they were on duty. But he defended his efforts to improve conditions in a short period of time.\n\u201cWe have protected lighting in the stairwells, we are constantly removing garbage and constantly mopping up the floors,\u201d Oliver said and added that squatters may be the root of the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s one step forward and two steps back.\u201d\nFlood\u2019s attorney said perception of the property so far has been \u201cone-sided.\u201d\nSeaton disagreed.\n\u201cI have heard more than one side of the story. I have heard this case on two different occasions and gave instructions to the property manager and they are still not done and I have pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the property manager hasn\u2019t taken some steps but he hasn\u2019t taken enough\u2026 God forbid a fire occurs in this building and the people get burned up \u2026 the court will not allow that.\u201d\nSome tenants noted that issues at the property had been piling up for some time and only gained attention after the raid.\n\u201cI thought this was a great location at first but I would love to relocate,\u201d said one tenant. \u201cThis building hadn\u2019t gotten coverage before the ICE situation but this building has been in decline for two years.\u201d\nCity code violations and foreclosure records also state conditions at the building started to decline well before the raid took place.\nSometime in the last two years, the conditions at the property deteriorated rapidly, despite it undergoing a multimillion renovation shortly before Flood bought it in 2020.\nSeaton said the efforts made since the raid were too little, too late.\n\u201cThe court does acknowledge that your property management has tried to remediate some of the conditions,\u201d Seaton said to Oliver. \u201cBut the court has found that the remediation has not been sufficient to make the building safe and habitable which is why the court is appointing a receiver to relocate the tenants and if necessary to evict the squatters.\u201d",

        "content": "Sometimes suing for perfection can bring change, even after years of litigation.\nA six-year legal fight over the construction of Laura Ricketts\u2019 $13 million\nWilmette\nlakefront mansion ended with the Chicago Cubs co-owner recovering only a fraction of what she sought.\nAn arbitration panel awarded Ricketts roughly $600,000 \u2014 about 12 percent of her $5 million exterior claims \u2014 after rejecting the bulk of her complaints against LG Construction Group, the home\u2019s builder, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nRicketts accused LG and architecture firm\nMorgante Wilson\nof botching everything from millwork and windows to the radiant heating system in her six-bedroom Sheridan Road estate.\nRicketts bought the property in the 400 block of Sheridan Road in Wilmette for $6.5 million under a trust in 2010,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst\nreported\n. Construction on the home began in 2012 and continued until 2016. Ricketts and her family moved into the home in 2015 while work was ongoing that ultimately cost $12.8 million.\nRicketts, who also co-owns the Chicago Sky and Chicago Red Stars, began documenting more than 1,500 alleged defects soon after moving in, claiming the problems added $7 million to the project\u2019s price tag. Morgante Wilson settled privately with her before arbitration began, leaving LG to face the claims.\nThe arbitrators found that Ricketts failed to prove most of her allegations, concluding that none of the interior issues \u2014 which totaled $8 million \u2014 stemmed from construction defects. Instead, they sided with LG\u2019s argument that the complaints reflected \u201can improper standard of perfection\u201d and normal wear and tear after nearly a decade in the home.\nThe decision followed a year of arbitration hearings and testimony spanning more than 12,000 pages.\n\u201cOur construction quality and our reputation have been validated,\u201d\nLG principal\nBrian Goldberg told the outlet.\nThe $600,000 award was fully covered by subcontractor settlements and insurance, according to LG\u2019s legal team at Traub Lieberman. Goldberg said his firm did not pay any portion of the award out of pocket but acknowledged the company is still recouping legal costs after years of defense.\nRicketts, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. Arbitration proceedings are private, and details of the settlement and the arbitrators\u2019 identities are confidential.\nThe dispute centered on questions of liability and patience.\nGoldberg said Ricketts didn\u2019t notify LG of many alleged defects until years after moving in, denying the builder a chance to make repairs. Among her complaints were leaks, warped woodwork, uneven floors and roofing failures in a glass-walled \u201cLake Room\u201d facing Lake Michigan.\n",

The seller was a joint venture between two Bay Area real estate firms, Vacaville-based Chronograph Properties and San Jose-based Swenson, which developed the property that opened in May of this year.\nThe 114-unit community at 400 Blossom Hill Road in Los Gatos sold for well above its assessed value from January of this year of $38.4 million. Harrison Street Real Estate has been a repeat investor in senior living communities, investing approximately $14.6 billion in senior housing assets for a total of 43,000 combined units in the two decades since its founding.\nThe sale of the resort-style Ivy Park complex was part of a six-property portfolio transaction from Harrison Street, which partnered with senior living company Oakmont Senior Living and general contractor Blue Mountain Enterprises to acquire the properties. Harrison Street purchased the properties through HSRE BME Blossom Hill Road LLC, a joint-venture entity created with Blue Mountain Enterprises.\nThe 669-unit purchase includes five operational senior communities in California and one empty development site scheduled for completion with new residences in 2027, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The other properties are in Santa Rosa, Bakersfield, Vallejo and\nFairfield\n,\nper\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal. The overall sale price was more than $200 million for the six-property portfolio.\nThe sale comes as\nnew construction of multifamily properties in the Bay Area slows\n, with ground-up and redevelopment projects becoming fewer and farther between. In Oakland, for example, Ellis Partners is\nseeking to turn a former American National Red Cross building\ninto a seven-story, 197-unit senior housing facility.\nMeanwhile, near Los Gatos in San Jose, Shashi Group is\nseeking to convert the Aloft San Jose Cupertino hotel\ninto a senior residential care facility. That plan calls for an 80-unit complex offering assisted living and memory care.\nHarrison Street previously\nbought the 94-room Oakmont at Silver Creek\nsenior living facility\u00a0 in San Jose in 2023 for $50.8 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The\ncollapse of Lurin Capital\u2019s multifamily portfolio\nisn\u2019t just affecting the firm\u2019s investors and\nlenders\n; mismanagement of its properties has rendered some tenants homeless.\nA Collin County judge ordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments in Plano, which is owned by Jon Venetos\u2019 firm, to vacate by Nov. 4, due to unsafe conditions at the property, KXAS first\nreported\n.\nJudge Bryan Gantt granted the city of Plano a temporary restraining order on Oct. 27. The property, at 3500 Hillridge Drive, had racked up 1,458 code violations, and nearly 100 lawsuits were filed against Venetos and property managers regarding the conditions at the property.\nEven so, the filing said residents still had no water, sewer or gas at the complex.\nVenetos responded, asking the court to dissolve the order. He said the city didn\u2019t follow Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in pursuing the order. Judge Gantt denied the request.\nLurin purchased the complex in 2022, deed records show. The 264-unit property was built in 1975. City official Curtis Howard called it \u201cthe worst apartment complex we have in the city of Plano,\u201d the outlet reported.\nThe order comes amid mounting legal trouble for Jon Venetos, whose firm has been bleeding properties all year.\nLender Acore claims Venetos defaulted on nearly $400 million worth of loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas. The 12 Florida properties\nheaded to foreclosure auction\nin April.\nAcore also claims Venetos personally guaranteed the $394.4 million he borrowed. The lender filed six lawsuits in October\nasking for judgments totaling $80.7 million\n, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nAcore alleges his liability was triggered when he defaulted on the loans and when he allowed mechanics\u2019 liens to be placed on the properties.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\n",

        "content": "The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office is cracking down on rental scammers \u2014 and the timing could be an opportunity for rental agents.\nProsecutors on Thursday charged a 35-year-old man with identity theft and other crimes after he allegedly duped a would-be subletter out of rent money. The case comes after the DA recently charged two other men in similar schemes.\nIn the latest indictment, prosecutors claim Anthony Pittman stole a woman\u2019s identity and forged documents to rent a luxury apartment in Murray Hill, only to sublet it to another tenant. The unit at the center of the case is a building on Third Avenue called the Aurora, where one-bedrooms rent for about $4,600, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n.\nJust weeks before announcing the charges, prosecutors also accused 36-year-old Adam Chatwin of\nfalsely posing\nas the landlord of a Midtown studio only to pocket $32,000 in upfront costs from four prospective tenants. Turns out, Chatwin was only subletting the place for a month.\nThe clampdown is coming as rents are growing increasingly\nmore expensive\nand as the topic of affordable housing is top of mind for most New Yorkers on the heels of a mayoral election where candidates campaigned on solving the crisis.\nBut it\u2019s also arriving as the city\u2019s rental agents on both the landlord and tenant side have been scrambling to redefine their worth after the \u201cbroker fee ban\u201d\ntook effect\nin June. With many owners newly footing the bill for broker fees \u2014 and questioning whether they should \u2014 agents are searching for fresh ways to justify their role.\nThe scams may seem unrelated to rental agents\u2019 plight, but as one broker pointed out a couple of months ago, one of the benefits to hiring an agent is to vet and verify prospective tenants.\n\u201cA for-rent-by-owner reached out to me, and I told him, \u2018it\u2019s going to cost you more money to hire me, but I\u2019ll get you a qualified person,\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht said in September. \u201cYou can do it by yourself and maybe collect the rent on the front end. But this isn\u2019t about the first month\u2019s rent. It\u2019s about 12 or 24 months of rent.\u201d\nLandlords \u201cthink they\u2019re going to save a couple of dollars to do it themselves,\u201d Hecht added. \u201cBut brokers get a better sense if someone is serious or not.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe residential market in Downtown Manhattan was already hot \u2014 but a couple of new, pricey listings could turn the temperature up higher.\nEarlier this week, filmmaker Neil Burger and his wife, architect Diana Kellogg, listed their townhouse in Tribeca for $30 million. The couple bought the 40-foot-wide home at 4 Staple Street for just $1.7 million in 2002.\nBuilt in 1868, the property spans 4,100 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also includes a 2,500-square-foot studio, office and wine cellar at 1 Jay Street as well as roughly 3,000 potential extra square feet of air rights.\nBurger, known for movies such as \u201cLimitless\u201d and \u201cDivergent,\u201d and Kellogg listed their abode just a week after news of another expensive listing below 14th Street dropped.\nDeveloper Alf Naman is preparing to list a penthouse at his\nboutique condo at 125 Perry Street\nfor a whopping $85 million \u2014 a figure that could give a pending deal at a nearby new development a run for its money.\nThe penthouse, one of seven condos at the former parking garage, will likely be the most expensive listing downtown and among the top five in all of Manhattan once it hits the market.\nIf it scores a deal close to its asking price, it could challenge a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street which found a buyer in August with an asking price of\n$88 million\n.\nThe deal hasn\u2019t yet closed, so the actual price of the sale is still unknown. But unless the developer offloaded it for a discount of tens of millions, the trade is likely to set a new record for a condo sale in Downtown Manhattan, a bar that was just raised in March when a condo at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles sold for\n$60 million\n.\nHowever, there\u2019s likely another contender in the race to break the Downtown record: Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 80 Clarkson. The team behind the project has been tight-lipped about its deals, but judging from\nsome of the pricing\nreleased in its offering plan, big ticket trades are surely on the horizon once the building begins closing.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a townhouse on the Upper East Side, which sold for $16.8 million, or $2,700 per square foot. The five-story property at 48 East 81st Street hit the market last September asking $19 million.\nThe 7,400-square-foot abode, built in 1924 and gut-renovated in 2019, has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It also features seven marble fireplaces, a roof deck and solarium.\nSociete Real Estate\u2019s Sarah Wiliams and Peter Stack had the listing, along with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Madeline Hult Elghanayan, Allison Chalfin and George Vanderploeg.\n",

That\u2019s up from around 53% for the year prior, per Placer data cited by Bishop Ranch owner and operator Sunset Development.\nBy contrast, the return-to-office rate was 49 percent in Silicon Valley and 41.8 percent in San Francisco, per Kastle Access Control System data cited by the Mercury News. San Francisco\nclimbed out of last place nationally\nin RTO rates earlier this year.\nEmployees are also seemingly spending more time at the office once they arrive. Average office dwell times at Bishop Ranch have climbed back up to 96 percent of pre-pandemic levels, representing daily stints at the office ranging from 5.4 to 6.3 hours. Some office neighborhoods at Bishop Ranch have even seen daily office stays exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nBishop Ranch is in the midst of a transformation from an office campus into a community complete with offices, housing, retail, restaurant, entertainment and lodging space. About 8,000 homes are in active planning or under construction at the San Ramon enclave.\nThe hope is that the increase in on-site living will in turn drive up return-to-office rates and office stay times. Sunset Development noted that walking to work has increased 11.8 percent since 2019, while commutes of 10 minutes or less have grown 28.2 percent. The positive trends seem to speak to Bishop Ranch being a \u201cdynamic environment where businesses, employees and residents all benefit,\u201d according to\nSunset Development CEO Alex Mehran Jr.\nLast month, the City of San Ramon signed off on\nplans for Bishop Ranch\u2019s first fully affordable housing development\n. The 200-unit project from Eden Housing at 2453 Camino Ramon will bring residences for seniors and families to a 2.2-acre site donated by Sunset Development. That includes a 120-unit residential building for working families and 80 separate residences for seniors.\nWhile more workers are returning to the office at Bishop Ranch, offices in general at the development seem to be shrinking, not growing. Several offices across Bishop Ranch are either slated for or in the process of\nbeing converted into housing\n. The East Bay at large is\nexpected to see the most office-to-residential conversions\nin the Bay Area over the next five years.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One developer\u2019s leverage can be a city official\u2019s nightmare as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d is taking place in developments along the outskirts of cities.\nA Texas law has stripped cities\u2019 sway in determining how subdivisions are built and regulated in their extraterritorial jurisdictions, creating flexibility in the eyes of some developers and chaos for neighboring cities.\nThe move stems from Senate Bill 2038 \u2014 the \u201cETJ Opt-Out Bill\u201d \u2014 which allows landowners to remove property from a city\u2019s ETJ, where municipalities can regulate land just beyond their borders, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The law, which took effect in 2023, unleashed a power shift in development dynamics.\nDevelopers see newfound flexibility in negotiating infrastructure and utilities; cities see chaos.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the tail wagging the dog,\u201d\nFort Worth\nAssistant City Manager Dana Burghdoff told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t plan for random.\u201d\nWhen nearly 2,000 acres west of Fort Worth sold in 2022, the city of Aledo branded it the \u201cGateway to Aledo,\u201d a sprawling, mixed-use vision known as Dean Ranch.\nTwo years later, that gateway is under new management. Part of Dean Ranch has quietly shifted into the neighboring city of Willow Park through the legal process enacted in SB 2038.\nIn the Aledo case, developer Logan Beall of Beall Development pulled 317 acres out of Fort Worth\u2019s ETJ to join Willow Park, where he\u2019s planning a $500 million community of homes, apartments and light industrial uses near Interstate 20 and FM 1187. Beall said the decision came down to infrastructure.\n\u201cWillow Park had the sewer capacity ready,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt allowed us to get going fastest.\u201d\nWillow Park Assistant City Manager Toni Fisher said the city council already approved a development agreement and that other Dean Ranch landowners are exploring similar annexations.\nBut the jurisdictional shuffle sparked friction: Fort Worth and Aledo attorneys accused Willow Park of overstepping by annexing a 10-acre stretch of Bankhead Highway right-of-way. City officials are negotiating behind closed doors.\nStatewide, the new law prompted thousands of \u201cde-annexation\u201d petitions and legal challenges from cities like\nGrand Prairie\n, whose lawsuit was dismissed this spring.\nMeanwhile, cities are racing to adapt. Fort Worth received nearly 5,000 acres\u2019 worth of release requests, according to city data, raising fears of \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d development patterns that disrupt long-term infrastructure planning.\nThe city of Austin had\n191 petitions\nfor \u201cdirect release\u201d in the first two months alone when the law took effect in 2023.\nFor developers, it\u2019s a new era of leverage.\n\u201cHaving a choice is not a bad thing,\u201d Beall said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The walled and gated property includes a regulation tennis court, a private courtyard and a 42-foot-long pool.\nIt\u2019s one of several homes in the Crespi Estates, a subdivision that the\nCenturion American\nmagnate is developing on land that formerly belonged to the\nCrespi Estate\n, a manor at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane designed for Italian Count Pio Crespi.\nMoayedi bought the Crespi Estate at auction for $36.2 million in 2017 and replatted about 12 acres to develop spec mansions that quickly joined the historic property as some of Texas\u2019 priciest homes.\nThe home was taken off the market in February and relisted in April for $14.9 million, the price it was asking when it sold. The final sales price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe buyer is Hector Martinez Martinez, and the purchase took place in September, according to county records. Since no financing instrument is recorded on the property, Martinez may have paid cash. Moayedi was offering owner financing at 6.5 percent interest with a 25 percent down payment.\nDave Perry-Miller agents represented both parties, with Charles Gregory listing the home and Ryan Streiff representing the buyer.\nOther Crespi Estates properties include\n5531 Walnut Hill Lane\n, which was Texas\u2019 most-expensive new listing\nwhen it was under construction\nin July 2023 with a $16 million price. The completed home is asking $16.5 million, down from $17.6 million in May.\nAsking $64 million, the original Crespi Estate, now owned by the Cox Charlee Lochridge Dynasty Trust, is one of the most expensive listings in Texas.\n",

        "content": "After months of forecasting disaster, real estate responded to Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election victory with a resounding shrug.\nLeading up to the election, industry players across sectors threw their money and their mouths behind the mayor-elect\u2019s opponents, including\nshelling out $13 million\nfor political action committees aimed at defeating Mamdani and/or putting former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in Gracie Mansion.\nSince the results were called late Tuesday night, several of Mamdani\u2019s most vocal adversaries in real estate appear to be backing off of some of their more grim predictions. Some are extending olive branches in the hopes for a seat at the table with the incoming administration.\n\u201cI want to give the guy a chance,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman\ntold TRD on Wednesday\n. \u201cHe wants to achieve great things and make people\u2019s lives better, and I respect that.\u201d\nThe chief executive\u2019s tone seems to have shifted from July, when she told the New York Times she considered Mamdani inexperienced, among other concerns.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never even worked at a McDonald\u2019s, let alone run the greatest city in the world,\u201d Freedman told the outlet (though she added that \u201cthe world will clearly not come to an end\u201d if Mamdani were to win the election).\nPeter Riguardi, president of JLL\u2019s New York office, on Wednesday sent employees what he described as a unifying email urging them to \u201cgive him a chance to lead,\u201d adding that \u201cmaybe for those of us who doubt him, he\u2019ll surprise us.\u201d (Not everyone at the company adopted the same conciliatory attitude. A top broker at the firm, Scott Pranzer,\nwas fired\nlater that day over his response to the email, which included comparing Mamdani to Hitler.)\nEven Compass agent Jason Haber, who led a fundraising push for a PAC benefitting Cuomo, changed his tune \u2014 though only slightly.\nAfter Mamdani\u2019s win was announced, Haber said it \u201cwould be foolish to reject everything carte blanche\u201d \u2014 this coming from the man who\npreviously said\n, \u201cevery one of his policies, every one, will make the city less affordable and less livable and less safe\u201d and that Mamdani \u201cseems to have an allergy towards entrepreneurs in this city.\u201d\nBut a win is a win, and it appears real estate is\nready to forgo\nsome of its more harsh criticisms of Mamdani to rally behind the one thing they may have in common with the Assembly member: bringing more housing to New Yorkers.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDuring third-quarter earnings calls, brokerage executives routinely touted their investments in artificial intelligence technology for agents. But which of those tools are agents actually using and which are just noise? Send your thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nRoughly\n125 million commercial airline passengers traveled through\nthe three largest airports in the New York City metropolitan area last year, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Those airports \u2014 JFK, LaGuardia and Newark \u2014 are among the 40 ordered to reduce operations this week amid the government shutdown.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRepublican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in northern New York, announced on Friday that she plans to enter the race for the state\u2019s next governor,\nABC 7\nreported. Stefanik, known as a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, will challenge the incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul, of whom she has been a vocal critic.\nFollowing previous denials and a reported push from the president, the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation greenlit a water-quality permit needed to advance a proposed gas pipeline that would run near Staten Island and the Rockaways, according to\nGothamist\n.\nGracie Mansion is haunted, Mayor Eric Adams said during his\ninterview with comedian Ziwe\n. Their discussion began with his efforts to crack down on the city\u2019s rat population and ended with what he looks for in a handshake. Memorable stops in between included a question from Ziwe about why Adams didn\u2019t get a hair transplant during any of his numerous trips to Istanbul, a nod to the federal charges filed against the mayor.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$19 million\nfor 40 Fifth Avenue, PHC. The Greenwich Village co-op unit last sold in 2023 for $17 million. The seller is listed as Randolph Lerner.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$33.3 million\nfor 765 First Avenue. The Turtle Bay rental building has 32 units and is 15,500 square feet. The sale is between two United Nations missions of Qatar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $65 million for 70 Vestry Street, Unit PHS. The Tribeca condo is 7,800 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,386-square-foot, two-story building at 1200 Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn. Sherri Privitera of Populous is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",
