        "content": "The yield on a 30-year Treasury note is\nnearly 5 percent\n. What does that have to do with real estate in New York?\nConsider the real-world example of a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in a prime West Village location. After the death of its tenant for the past 30 years, its owner, a Daily Dirt reader, estimated that it would cost more than $100,000 to do a proper renovation.\nHowever, under the 2019 rent stabilization law, he could only\nrecover $30,000\nof that expense through a temporary rent increase that would raise the rent to $1,428 per month.\nThe landlord calculated that his return on investment would be about 2 percent. That seems acceptable to politicians like Linda Rosenthal, who chairs the Assembly\u2019s housing committee and is herself a rent-stabilized tenant. They expect owners to do the renovation, find another tenant (who might stay for 30 years), and make that 2 percent return, rather than leave the unit empty.\nBut who in his right mind would invest six figures in a rent-stabilized apartment to make 2 percent rather than buy a Treasury note, the safest investment on Earth, and make 4.8 percent?\nTreasury notes are not only more reliable and pay better, but they involve a lot less\nagita\nand effort than rent-stabilized tenants.\nGovernment securities don\u2019t call 311 with complaints, miss payments,\nclog toilets\n,\nbreed dogs\nor make noise at odd hours.\n\nT-notes don\u2019t\nsneak in subletters\n,\nstop paying rent\nand\ntie you up in housing court\nfor two years. They don\u2019t\nset fires\n, flood apartments or cause gas leaks.\nSecurities can be sold with a mouse-click, whereas a rent-stabilized tenant is entitled to perpetual lease renewals and\nsuccession rights\n.\nSinking $100,000 into a renovation is an illiquid investment with a high opportunity cost, meaning the money cannot be repurposed if an\nemergency arises\nor something better comes along.\nTenant advocates say landlords like to overstate the cost of repairs. Why not slap a new coat of paint on the unit, replace the appliances, refinish the floors and call it a day?\n\u201cIf I did a $30,000 renovation, there is a real probability that I would be hauled into court for substandard renovation and would be ordered to renovate the apartment further for free,\u201d the owner said by email. \u201cThat\u2019s why there are more than 50,000 apartments sitting vacant in the middle of a major housing shortage.\u201d\nWith a change in the law, he said, \u201cThey could be back online within six months.\u201d\nThe state legislature reconvenes in January, so the soonest a reform could pass is next year. The latest it could happen is never.\n",

        "content": "New York City was shattered this week by the senseless shooting at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan, and the real estate community was especially impacted by the tragedy.\nOn Monday evening, a man\nopened fire\nat Rudin Management\u2019s property. Ultimately, four people were killed in the incident, as well as the gunman, later identified as Shane Devon Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nThe motive is unclear, though the perpetrator claimed to suffer from CTE, a neurodegenerative disease linked to head trauma, sometimes brought up in tragic incidents involving former football players; the NFL is headquartered at 345 Park.\nOne of those\nkilled\nwas a young associate at Rudin, Julia Hyman, who was murdered when the gunman reportedly went to the 33rd floor by mistake, where Rudin is based. She had a stint as a summer intern at Newmark before working at the real estate investment firm Sagehall, according to her LinkedIn profile. She joined Rudin as an associate in November.\nAnother victim was\n43-year-old Wesley LePatner\n, who was the chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust. She took over that role in January from the retiring\nFrank Cohen\n, taking charge of the $55 billion BREIT\u2014 among the world\u2019s largest REITs by net asset value, making her one of the most prominent women in the industry.\n\u201cWords cannot express the devastation we feel,\u201d Blackstone said in a statement. \u201cWesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed. She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond.\u201d\nHer death sent shockwaves through the real estate industry, leading to an outpouring from LePatner\u2019s coworkers and colleagues as they\ntook to social media\nto remember her.\n\n\n\u201cShe made time for so many of us\u2014especially junior women at Blackstone\u2014always offering guidance, support, and was a powerful example of how to lead with strength and compassion,\u201d Blackstone principal Susan Webster Murphy posted.\nChief executive officer Steven Schwarzman called LePatner \u201can incredible woman who had an infectious energy and inner light \u2014 a light that will shine far brighter than the shadow cast by this senseless tragedy.\u201d\nThe day after the shooting,\nheightened security\nwas noticeable across Manhattan office buildings: more suited staffers in the lobbies and police officers stationed near entrances.\nRXR, one of the city\u2019s largest commercial property owners, were among the landlords to respond, increasing security patrols and security supervisor visits at its buildings out of an abundance of caution, according to a company spokesperson.\nOther notable headlines from the week in New York City real estate:\nBay Ridge mansion takes prize for priciest Brooklyn ask at $25M\nMayor Eric Adams vetoes Council\u2019s rejection of Bally\u2019s casino plan\nMerchants Bank sees 50% drop in income, cites mortgage fraud",

        "content": "In the world of debt and real estate, it\u2019s difficult to keep things all in the family.\nTwo lenders are now casting suspicion upon developer Meyer Chetrit\u2019s effort to pay a debt to his late brother. The lenders claim the family payment is Meyer\u2019s attempt to hide his assets as the creditors come after him for hundreds of millions. It\u2019s just one of the many fights the Chetrit family is waging with its lenders over properties.\nPincusCo\nwas the first to report on the lawsuits.\nMack Real Estate Credit Strategies and Maverick  Real Estate Partners are trying to claw back money from Meyer, to the tune of $220 million for Mack and $132 million for Maverick.\nThe two have drawn attention to a legal maneuver involving Meyer and the estate of his late brother, Jacob Chetrit. In June, Meyer filed a court document saying that he owed his brother\u2019s estate $21.7 million. That case also revealed Jacob Chetrit\u2019s net worth when he died in January: $825 million.\nLawyers for Mack Real Estate argued Meyer\u2019s legal maneuver \u201creeks of fraud.\u201d In a memo filed this week, they claim Meyer\u2019s debt to his brother is an effort to remove assets from his name or allow the estate to claim priority.\nCourt documents from Meyer and the estate say he owes his brother repayment for loans he received, as well as funding he was meant to invest in their shared transactions.\n\nMack is the lender behind two Chetrit properties: the Hotel Carter on West 43rd Street and 545 West 37th Street. In an ongoing case, the creditor claims Meyer and other brother Joseph Chetrit owe them $220 million in loans and guarantees.\nMaverick already won its $132 million judgment against Meyer and is seeking to enforce it in court. Elliott Joffe, a lawyer for Baron Samson who is representing Meyer in the Maverick case, said attorneys \u201cdeny in the strongest terms possible any and all allegations of fraud or wrongdoing.\u201d\nThat debt in that case arises from loans connected to a Midtown development site where the Chetrit Group once planned to build a 33-story hotel. Maverick\nseized\nthe site in 2023.\nIn June, Maverick won a temporary court order preventing Meyer from executing the debt payment to his brother\u2019s estate.\nLawyers for Meyer Chetrit and the estate of Jacob Chetrit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nElsewhere, Meyer Chetrit is facing allegations of\nintentional self-dealing\nand\nmismanagement\nin foreclosure suits from lenders.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article mistakenly named Maverick Financial, not Maverick  Real Estate Partners\n,\nas one of the lenders behind the lawsuits.",

        "content": "The Adams administration released a ton of housing production numbers today. Here\u2019s what they mean.\nThe mayor on Friday announced that since he entered office, the city has created, preserved or planned 426,800 homes.\nThat number includes 95,100 units created, 134,700 preserved and 197,000 planned units since 2022.\n\u201cCreated\u201d includes 45,900 apartments financed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. That means these are units where public financing has closed, not where construction has necessarily been completed yet.\nAnother 46,900 market rate units \u2014\u00a0that involve some kind of HPD assistance \u2014 are included in the \u201ccreated\u201d figure, as are 2,300 units that are being converted from office space as part of the city\u2019s Office Conversion Accelerator.\n\u201cPreserved\u201d includes 40,100 apartments preserved through HPD financing that are subject to agency regulatory agreements. Another 78,500 units reflect stabilization programs that are not subject to regulatory agreements.\nThe administration also counts 12,400 public housing units that are being converted to Section 8 housing through the Permanent Affordability Commitment Together, or PACT, program, as well as 3,700 units through the Comprehensive Modernization program.\n\u201cPlanned\u201d includes the 82,000 units that are projected to be built over the next 15 years, thanks to zoning changes made as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. It also includes housing units expected to be built as a result of five neighborhood rezonings, and another 3,000 units that will be built at the defunct Flushing Airport \u2014\u00a0which the mayor announced this week \u2014\u00a0and other city-owned sites where the city is still working to find a developer.\nFinally, the number includes any state projects where the city has a central role, such as the\nBrooklyn Marine Terminal\n. The latest plan called for 6,000 housing units, but the project is still being negotiated by a task force that has not been able to agree to terms that would allow that development to move forward. The task force has already shaved thousands of housing units from the project\u2019s projected total.\nThat is the tricky thing about\nplanned\nunits. Nothing is guaranteed and in many cases, these projections rely on factors outside the city\u2019s control. Neighborhood rezonings, and the zoning changes under City of Yes, rely on developer appetite. We\u2019ve seen that that appetite is\nnot always as voracious\nas predicted.\nMayor Eric Adams has been putting a lot of emphasis on\nplanned\nunits lately. You\u2019ve probably heard the mayor mention that his is the most pro-housing administration ever seen by the city.\nHe\u2019s also said that his administration will build \u201cmore housing in one term than [in] the 12 years under Bloomberg [and] the eight years under de Blasio combined.\u201d (Erik Engquist did a\nfact check\non this last week.)\nWhat he meant by that is his administration\nplans\nto generate more housing than those previous administrations, based on the zoning changes his administration has made, including City of Yes and the five neighborhood rezonings. Those projected units will not be built during his first term, and won\u2019t all be built during a second term, should there be one. It\u2019s also not clear if those projected totals will ultimately hold up.\nNumbers provided by city officials note that zoning tools under the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations were projected to net 101,584 units, total. Again, these are all projections.\nStill, these zoning changes clear a path for tens of thousands of housing units that otherwise could not be built.\n\nOn Friday, the administration released its fiscal year 2025 housing production numbers. In the past year, HPD financed the creation or preservation of 28,281 units of affordable housing, which is 11 percent more than the previous year. Of that 13,361 were new and 14,920 were preservation units.\nThe preservation levels are the highest seen during the Adams administration. That\u2019s because HPD\u2019s preservation financing team was gutted during the pandemic. The number of housing units preserved through HPD financing has rebounded, according to administration officials, and is closer to pre-pandemic levels.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill the Second Circuit side with REBNY in its\ncontinued\nfight against the FARE Act? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nIn fiscal year 2025, 6,860 units received the property tax break J-51. The previous year, that number was 10,954.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 re-election campaign submitted at least 52 forged or fraudulently obtained signatures on a petition to qualify for the November ballot as an independent candidate,\nGothamist\nreports. The number of problematic signatures may be much higher; the fraudulent signatures identified by Gothamist were collected by at least nine workers who collectively submitted more than 5,000 signatures.\n\u2014 Funerals were held this week for the Blackstone exec Wesley LePatner, Rudin associate Julia Hyman and NYPD Det. Didarul Islam, among the four victims of Monday\u2019s Midtown office shooting, along with security guard Aland Etienne,\nCBS News\nreported.\n\u2014 On Monday, Blackstone will reopen its New York headquarters in the building where the shooting took place. It will give employees the option to work remotely for the week, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$17.7 million\nfor 246 West 12th Street. The West Village townhouse is 5,000 square feet and last sold on the market in 2018 for $8.9 million.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nChristopher Riccio and Elana Zinoman have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18.4 million\nfor 63-36 98th Place. The Rego Park co-op building has 66 units and is 67,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29 million for a penthouse unit at 988 Fifth Avenue. The new construction condo on the Upper East Side is a duplex, 6,000-square-foot unit.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nLeighton Candler, Jennifer Reardon and Rachel Brandeis have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a proposed 249,629-square-foot, 12-story building at 401 West 19th Street. Manish Chadha of Ismael Leyva Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

Unit PHB spans 5,500 square feet and has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms.

Since then, 41 of the building\u2019s 62 units have entered contract with an average asking price of $2,700 per square foot.\nAmenities at the Robert A.M.

The developer scored a $236 construction loan from JP Morgan and Starwood Capital in 2023, followed by another\n$140 million\nfrom JP Morgan a year later.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a townhouse on the Upper East Side, with an asking price of $8.8 million. The five-story, 9,500-square-foot property, divided into offices, a home and a one-bedroom rental unit, hit the market two years ago asking $11 million.\nCompass\u2019 Ian Slater, Brett Walsdorf and Michael Koeneke had the listing.\nOf the nine properties, eight were condos, and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $79.8 million, for an average price of $8.9 million and a median of $7.2 million. The typical home spent more than 580 days on the market and was discounted 11 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "Municipal bondholders in New Jersey\u2019s American Dream Mall are running out of runway.\nA state tax judge last week slashed the megamall\u2019s assessed value by $850 million, bringing it to $1.65 billion for the current tax year. That\u2019s down about $800 million from what the Borough of East Rutherford pegged it at\nearlier this year\nand nearly $1.7 billion less than the property\u2019s previous appraisal, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nThe reduction is the latest blow to bondholders carrying $800 million in debt backed by PILOTs \u2014 payments in lieu of taxes \u2014 meant to fund the mall\u2019s development. At the latest assessed value, annual payments on those are expected to drop to just $24 million, far short of the $54 million needed to service the debt.\nThe cut comes months after East Rutherford had already lowered the mall\u2019s value by $800 million to $2.5 billion, a move that had dropped PILOT payments to $36.5 million, already insufficient to cover interest due. The bond trustee had to dip into reserves last year and with just $38 million left as of December, the math isn\u2019t in investors\u2019 favor.\nOwner Triple Five Group has appealed tax assessments going back to 2019, citing the pandemic\u2019s drag on performance. Its lawyers argued East Rutherford\u2019s appraisals were inflated by flawed methodology and unfair comps. They claimed American Dream had been valued higher than a batch of top-tier malls and even Six Flags Great Adventure combined.\n\nBondholders are exposed to valuation cuts and structural quirks in PILOT financing. The bonds don\u2019t technically default if payments fall short. Instead, balloon maturities originally scheduled from 2027 to 2050 can be pushed out as far as 2056. If they\u2019re still unpaid, holders are out of luck.\nTriple Five opened the 3.5 million-square-foot mall in late 2019, just months before the onset of the pandemic tanked its outlook. The project has since limped along through missed projections, lawsuits and looming debt. A $1.7 billion construction loan matures next year, adding to the pile.\nFor now, American Dream\u2019s tax victory buys time for its owners, but investors dreaming of a smooth ride just woke up to a harsher reality.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "\u201cFreeze the rent,\u201d half a million New York City registered Democrats said in June, when they ranked mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani high on their primary ballots, making him the nominee and quite possibly the next mayor.\nA debate on whether government should control how much renters pay once seemed settled: No, economists agreed \u2014 it leads to too many\nmarket distortions\n. But this primary\ncracked it open\nagain, bringing political and social rationale to bear against the economic argument, thanks to voters who find the city unaffordable and the current administration\u2019s emphasis on business friendliness unpalatable.\nAfter flirting with some price controls early in the 20th century, New York formalized rent control after World War II to address a shortage of affordable apartments, and rent stabilization in 1969. Over the following decades, the program shrunk, following amendments that let landlords deregulate units, until its 2019 expansion, when a state law did away with most methods for leaving stabilization, preserving the 1 million units left in\nstabilization\n.\nThe Real Deal\nasked leaders on each side of the issue to put their best case forward, in a new magazine feature called The Debate. Kenny Burgos, a former state Assembly member and CEO of the New York Apartment Association, a group of property owners and managers, argues no to controls on rent. Cea Weaver, who represents tenants at the New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice for All, and was on the ground for rent-freeze policies during the primary, says yes.\nNO!\nKenny Burgos\nCEO, the New York Apartment Association\nNew York City\u2019s affordable housing crisis is largely driven by a lack of supply. The 2023 Housing and Vacancy Survey found a vacancy rate of just 1.4 percent \u2014 functionally zero. But older rent-stabilized buildings provide the majority of affordable housing in New York City.\nMost economists agree that rent control schemes reduce incentives to build housing. Decades of research shows that strict price controls suppress new construction unless offset by strong pro-housing policies.\nIn New York, rent stabilization has become a major barrier to addressing housing supply because it is unusually rigid and regressive. Since 1974, the city has declared a \u201chousing emergency\u201d every three years based on a vacancy rate below 5%. This is necessary, under the law, to keep rent stabilization in place, and local politicians treat each renewal as a success.\u00a0 But low vacancy keeps the emergency going, and the policy discourages new housing, keeping vacancy low.\nThis system is a global outlier. Nowhere else are rent controls structured to rely on chronic scarcity. A healthy vacancy rate \u2014 between 8 percent and 10 percent \u2014 empowers tenants by giving them more choices and bargaining power. This should be the goal of the city.\n\u201cThis system is a global outlier. Nowhere else are rent controls structured to rely on chronic scarcity.\u201d\nAustin, Texas, is a case in point. Rapid population growth sparked a construction boom that increased housing options and pushed rents down, even for high-quality apartments.\nIn Austin, a modern three-bedroom, two-bath apartment in a desirable neighborhood rents for around $2,650. In Manhattan, a comparable unit would rent for $8,000 to $10,000.\nNew York\u2019s rent control rules are also uniquely hostile to long-term investment. It is the only system in the U.S. that doesn\u2019t guarantee rent increases in line with inflation. Even the recently passed \u201cgood cause eviction,\u201d which is a form of rent control on more expensive market-rate units, guarantees a minimum increase of 5 percent plus inflation.\nOver the past decade, the Rent Guidelines Board has approved rent adjustments roughly 1 percent below inflation annually, while property taxes have steadily risen. This has meant shrinking revenue for building owners, which threatens the financial health of older housing stock.\nCurrently, privately owned rent-stabilized buildings operate with roughly half the funding of similar NYCHA buildings, and do so with better quality.\n\nOther places have more balanced rent control schemes. In California, rent boards are required to adjust for inflation, and property tax increases can be passed through to tenants. In Minnesota, landlords can raise rents by 3 percent, with appeals up to 8 percent if operating costs rise.\nBecause New York\u2019s rent policy is structurally tied to scarcity, the city will never see abundant housing under the current approach. If New York City is serious about creating affordable housing, it must increase supply.\nYES!\nCea Weaver\nDirector of New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice For All\nH\nomes should be for rest, family and community. But for the real estate industry, \u201chousing\u201d is an investment vehicle. Profit comes first and a place for New Yorkers to live well is a distant concern.\nA system that relies on the profit motive, as ours does, leads to horrendous housing outcomes. The profit incentive produces an endless appetite to hike rents, reduce spending on repairs and maintenance, and pursue eviction. Our neighborhoods become less unaffordable, and housing instability threatens our collective ability to access education, healthcare and employment.\nRent stabilization is a proven policy that can interrupt this vicious cycle and keep our communities stable and whole, while balancing the need for buildings to cash-flow in order to function as housing.\nUnder New York City\u2019s current rent stabilization system, renters have the right to renew their leases to predictable and regular rent adjustments and to pass their unit onto their family members. This basic set of rights engenders higher-quality housing, as tenants can request repairs free from the fear of retaliatory eviction, and they do so, research shows.\nRent stabilization encourages affordability without direct government subsidy. Over 2.4 million tenants live in rent-stabilized apartments, including 37 percent of low-income households, triple the number in public housing and subsidized housing.\n\u201cRent stabilization is a proven policy that can interrupt this vicious cycle and keep our communities stable and whole, while balancing the need for buildings to cash-flow in order to function as housing.\u201d\nAs the federal government threatens to cut housing subsidies like Section 8, protecting and expanding rent stabilization is more important than ever.\nRent-control policies ensure generational stability without homeownership. Stable rents allow tenants to build lives without constant fear of eviction or sudden rent spikes, promoting vibrant communities and a healthy housing market.\nThere is a wide acceptance that predictable costs are a good thing and a healthy component of a functioning market. It\u2019s why, for example, property owners benefit from fixed-rate mortgages. Renters should have access to the same stability, especially as homeownership \u2014 always a myth, but a potent one \u2014 becomes unattainable for millions.\nImportantly, rent stabilization leads to civic participation. Housing stability means tenants vote at higher rates, and annual rent board hearings give us a clear stake in local politics. It creates the political conditions necessary to expand housing supply and truly solve our housing crisis.\nWhen renters, a solid political majority in New York City, know that they are safe from sudden rent hikes or no-fault eviction, they are more likely to join a coalition in support of more housing production. Study after study, from California to New Jersey, shows that measures to increase housing supply and regulate rents can work hand in hand to address the housing crisis.\nLandlords and developers fearmonger because rent control cuts down on their profit. But we know the benefits are clear. For over 100 years, rent stabilization has been the backbone of New York City, ensuring that the cooks, nurses, and bus drivers who keep our city running are able to stay.",

        "content": "Related Companies and Oxford Properties knew when to\nlay down their cards\nand walk away from the table.\nIn May, the firms abandoned their plan for a $12 billion casino in Hudson Yards, realizing that local Council member Erik Bottcher would not approve it. Folding isn\u2019t always losing, and the developers had a lucrative next play. By dropping the casino bid, they were able to secure a zoning change to build a little less housing than originally planned and avoid paying outright for a $2 billion platform over the railyards, which they need to develop.\nThe loss, as it went, was a win for the developers (though not for their casino partner, Wynn Resorts).\n\u201cIt became clear that a plan with a gaming resort could not get the votes needed,\u201d a Related\u00a0 spokesperson said. \u201cWe had to get creative.\u201d\nThere are eight firms competing (see\nCalculating the Odds\n) in perhaps the most contentious real estate project the city\u2019s ever seen, and New York is finally set to choose three for downstate casino licenses by the end of the year. Among other peculiarities, the selection process makes no guarantee of a casino in Manhattan, and if the going wisdom is correct that the two current slot parlors in the running (MGM\u2019s Empire City Casino in Yonkers and Genting\u2019s Resorts World in Queens) are likely to win, there\u2019s really just one license up for grabs. The list of developers vying for it includes big New York City real estate names: SL Green Realty, Soloviev Group, Silverstein Properties, Mets owner Steve Cohen and Thor Equities. For years, they\u2019ve\none-upped\neach other with promises of what they\u2019d bring if they won, mostly oodles of affordable housing and tons of jobs, while facing the fact that residents, elected officials, community groups and whole industries oppose the entire endeavor.\nBut if the competition began as a zero-sum game that threatened to leave the\nlosers\nwith years worth of time and money seemingly wasted, Related\u2019s moves hinted that the pay line had changed.\nAs the contest heads into its most critical stage and five contenders prepare for defeat, other teams have followed suit in revealing backup plans. The process of meeting with community members and elected officials, as well as thinking deeply about the demands of a particular site, has fostered new ideas for the would-be casino properties; some seem more palatable to elected officials and community members than a casino. If plans move forward, New York City might win more housing and economic development than it bet on.\nBut not all the developers have their chips on plan B. Some are steadfast that for their sites, it\u2019s casino or bust.\nT\nhe thick of it\nWhen Related dropped out of the running for a casino license, the race lost a sophisticated competitor.\nIn mathematical terms, that increases the odds for the other teams, especially those pitching casinos in Manhattan.\nBut the odds are not just about how many are playing; neighborhood politics affect each proposal\u2019s chances. A five- to six-member Community Advisory Committee, made up of local elected officials or their appointees, has to review every casino plan. That means, in some cases, the same City Council member and borough president \u2014 Bottcher and Mark Levine, respectively \u2014 who disapproved of Related\u2019s casino will have appointees reviewing the other Manhattan bids.\nIn order to advance to the final stage of the competition, a casino proposal needs two-thirds of the advisory committee to approve it.\n\u201cIf we lose, I will be able to sleep good at night, because I will have lost based on good governance and compliance\nwith all the rules and regulations.\u201d\nMichael Hershman, Soloviev Group\nSome members have been less shy about where they stand than others, including Manhattan Sen. Liz Krueger, whose appointee, Assembly member Richard Gottfried, sits on the committee considering SL Green\u2019s proposal. Krueger doesn\u2019t think Manhattan needs a casino. Gottfried is also Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s appointee on the CAC reviewing Silverstein Properties\u2019 $7 billion casino complex planned for a vacant site at 41st Street and 11th Avenue. Hoylman-Sigal has also spoken out against casinos in the borough.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be able to please everyone. We understand that,\u201d\nMichael Hershman\n, CEO of Soloviev Group, said when asked how his team plans to win over the committee\u2019s naysayers. \u201cWhen you try to do anything in New York City, you can never get a unanimous group together to support it.\u201d\nAs of the end of July, six of the applicants had made an initial presentation to their respective advisory committees. These groups will vote on the proposals by Sept. 30, and those approved will go on to the final round of the competition before the state Gaming Facility Location Board.\nT\nhe bright side\nOne side effect of the drawn-out casino process was that it revealed community opposition early and gave developers a chance to modify plans.\nIn Related\u2019s case, the firm was contending with a 2009 rezoning in Hudson Yards that called for builders to add 5,800 residential units, with 300 set aside as affordable.\nBut when the firm unveiled its proposal to change the zoning and include a casino in the Western Railyards, the company proposed a fraction of that, just 1,500 residential units total, with roughly the same affordable set aside. As the company drew closer to a City Council vote on its proposed modifications, Related upped the ante.\nIt also pitched using surplus payment in lieu of taxes to pay for a $2 billion platform over the active railyards. Doing so would allow the company to replace one of the office towers in its plan with two residential buildings. By the time the Council approved the project, Related dropped the casino and increased the number of housing units to up to 4,000 housing units, including at least 625 affordable apartments. Related\u2019s spokesperson said that\ngetting to this plan\nrequired cooperation from community members and elected officials.\nThe changes won over one of the project\u2019s fiercest critics, the Friends of the High Line, which had feared the casino complex would loom over its namesake park.\n\u201cThis was a win for the community and also for Related and a reminder of what\u2019s possible when community voices are heard,\u201d Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Friends of the High Line, said in a statement.\n\nOther applicants may be able to use the negative reactions to their casino proposals to bolster alternative plans or at least build up local rapport.\nThe Soloviev Group team, for example, removed a Ferris wheel from its proposal at the community\u2019s urging.\nSoloviev\u2019s Hershman believes his team, which includes Mohegan, has also\nearned goodwill\nwith the community by vowing to not make any campaign contributions to elected officials who have sway over the license.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to see politics driving this decision. They want to see merit driving this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we lose, I will be able to sleep good at night, because I will have lost based on good governance and compliance with all the rules and regulations.\u201d\nIf they don\u2019t score the license, Soloviev doesn\u2019t plan to leave its 6.5-acre plot near the United Nations vacant. The developer previously planned three condo towers and an office building on the site, which had faced community pushback.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you at this moment if we\u2019ll build a commercial tower,\u201d Hershman said. \u201cAnd frankly, the studies that we\u2019ve done show that the traffic increase would be greater if we go back to the original plan, than the [casino] plan we\u2019re proposing now.\u201d\nT\nhe holdouts\nFew applicants will acknowledge the possibility of alternative plans for their casino sites. Steve Cohen has insisted that 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field will remain asphalt if Metropolitan Park, the $8 billion casino complex he has proposed with Hard Rock International, is not realized.\nSL Green hasn\u2019t disclosed what will become of its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway if it isn\u2019t transformed into a $4 billion casino complex. In March, S&amp;P Global raised concerns that the building \u201cmay not be competitive in its current state\u201d and will require $68 million worth of work to become marketable, Crain\u2019s reported.\nSilverstein Properties\u2019 proposed casino site is at West 41st Street and 11th Avenue. It has floated and abandoned plans for condo and\ncommercial uses\nhere over the years. If the firm doesn\u2019t get the casino license, the site will remain vacant, Silverstein COO Dino Fusco said.\n\u201cThis giant hole in the ground has been there for quite some time.\u201d\nDino Fusco, Silverstein Properties\n\u201cThis giant hole in the ground has been there for quite some time,\u201d he said.\nHe doesn\u2019t see alternatives, adding, \u201cI wish there was. If there was, we would\u2019ve pursued it over the last 10 years that we owned the site.\u201d\nThor Equities\u2019 Peter McEneaney said \u201cthe Coney,\u201d its $3.4 billion casino proposal envisioned for a 5-acre stretch of beachfront between the Maimonides Park baseball stadium and Luna Park, is the only economic catalyst for turning Coney Island into a year-round destination.\n\u201cConey Island is a special place, but it has definitely fallen on hard times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to correct that is a generational type project like this.\u201d\nSome think that a lack of a contingency plan could backfire, however.\n\u201cThe fact that they do not have a Plan B if they don\u2019t win the casino license is hurting their chances, honestly,\u201d one source familiar with casino negotiations said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cBecause the community feels like, well, if they don\u2019t [get] the casino they want then they\u2019re just gonna let their land sit vacant for another 15 years.\u201d\nF\ninal stretch\nJust a few days before the Community Advisory Committee meetings began, the City Council seemed to deliver a death blow to Bally\u2019s Bronx casino proposal.\nThe Council voted down the company\u2019s proposal seeking zoning changes needed to turn a portion of the city-owned golf course at Bally\u2019s Golf Links into a $4 billion casino complex.\nThen, in late July, Mayor Eric Adams told The Real Deal he\u2019d veto the decision to \u201cre-level the playing field and allow the Bronx to have a seat at the table.\u201d The decision now goes back to the City Council, which will need two-thirds of the vote to override the mayor\u2019s veto, and then be reviewed and voted on by a Community Advisory Committee by the Sept. 30 deadline.\nWithout the casino license, Bally\u2019s would remain a golf course, just as the slot parlors run by Resorts World NYC in Jamaica, Queens, and MGM Resorts in Yonkers would continue on as gaming facilities.\u00a0 (The slot parlors have long been considered favorites for two of the three licenses up for grabs.)\nOnce the advisory committees decide what applications will survive, the state Gaming Facility Locations Board will select the winners.\nBy the end of the year, New Yorkers will know where casinos will rise downstate. The owners of the other five sites will walk away, though if they build anyway, it might not be clear who\u2019s won and who\u2019s lost the gamble.",

Now that his father,\nSteve Witkoff\n, is Special Envoy to the Middle East, the son\u2019s decade-long schooling at the family\u2019s development company, the Witkoff Group, is apparently over. Steve, out to firewall his peacemaking duties, put Alex, his co-CEO of two years, in the driver\u2019s seat. They say Alex can\u2019t call for advice in a pinch or even talk business at dinner.\nThat makes him unlike the Kushner and Trump inheritors, who during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration faced criticism over dealings that tangled business and governance. (A cryptocurrency venture run by Alex\u2019s brother Zach and championed by the administration brushes closer to conflict-of-interest territory.)\nAnd, in a business where generations make, lose, rebuild and lose again their family\u2019s fortunes, Alex also hasn\u2019t shown signs of wayward son impulses, like Stefan Soloviev with his grain train in Kansas or his brother Zach. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to different pastures,\u201d Zach told The Real Deal.\nAlex, rather, is a real businessman, a father\u2019s dream \u2014 smart, prepped and trained for a job leading expensive top-of-the-line projects in the nation\u2019s most competitive markets \u2014 and thus far he\u2019s managed to sidestep the spotlight, keep disasters out of the press and avoid embarrassment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of responsibility that comes with it,\u201d Alex said mildly from a chair overlooking the courtyard of the Witkoffs\u2019 One High Line. He wore all navy blue: pants, a short-sleeve collared shirt with white trim and sneakers, taking refuge in the building\u2019s air conditioning on a recent hot afternoon. \u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a good age and in my 30s, where I have tremendous energy, and we have a great team of people.\u201d\nThose who\u2019ve worked with Steve for decades say they\u2019re confident Alex has the chops to carry the business forward while his dad\u2019s off saving the world. By the end of last year, Witkoff Group\u2019s One High Line surpassed $1 billion in sales, while at South Florida\u2019s the\nShore Club\n, the penthouse reportedly scored a contract for $120 million, which would be a record deal for a condo in Miami-Dade County. The company took both projects over after foreclosures on HFZ Capital, the original developer.\nYet in an industry that worships an archetype of developer as skyline-shaping cowboy armed with nothing but chutzpah and a vision, he\u2019s an heir apparent who runs spreadsheets where his dad once strapped a handgun to his ankle, who opts for reputational management over devil-may-care audacity and defaults to reticence instead of charm.\nPerhaps his way is emblematic of a new generation rising in the ranks, one born to privilege, educated in the Ivy League and steeped in the idea of protecting a legacy created by someone more bombastic.\n\u201cHe worked hard, started from nothing and built something great,\u201d Alex said of his dad. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything to apologize for. I think that\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d\nBut maybe the smarts, attention to detail and number crunching carry their own risk: The pilot who can land a plane perfectly can\u2019t always imagine its next adventure. Alex thinks of development largely in terms of dollars and cents, he said in interviews, and though sources say his passion comes through in the creation of top-tier projects, especially their aesthetic details, he doesn\u2019t appear to be in it for the glory.\nO\nut of the ring\nWhen Alex was about 9, he didn\u2019t want to join the family business, his younger brother Zach remembered. \u201cI think he wanted to be a lawyer, actually.\u201d\nTo be fair, the scions felt mostly free to choose their own paths, Zach said, as long as they showed up at the top of their game.\nBut they also knew that their father wanted to pass the torch. He never sought to be \u201csome sort of old boxer,\u201d he told TRD in 2017.\n\u201cAny smart company is always thinking about succession,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we planned for it to happen exactly on November 5, 2024\u201d \u2014 the day Donald Trump won his re-election and Steve\u2019s path toward the administration came into focus.\nThe surprise element was a non-factor, if you ask the Witkoffs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hard call for me because I knew the business was in good hands,\u201d Steve\nsaid\nat\nTRD\n\u2019s New York Forum in May.\nSteve always said learning the job should start from the bottom, Zach recalled. His first role at Witkoff, when he was in high school, was at a nonunion construction team, working on one of the firm\u2019s rental properties on West 95th Street and Columbus Avenue.\n\u201cSteve can just charm you and bring you into this Steve magic. Alex is not so interested in that. They get the same thing accomplished, but they do it in different ways.\u201d\nPam Liebman, corcoran\nBut Alex,\u00a0who officially joined in 2015\u00a0after a stint at Morgan Stanley,\u00a0started out as executive vice president with hands in the firm\u2019s acquisitions and development departments. At the time, Witkoff was working on the Edition in West Hollywood, and Alex got his apprenticeship in\u00a0groundup\u00a0development there.\nFor both Witkoff brothers, the stakes were clear from the outset: Play your cards right, and the world\u2019s your oyster. Don\u2019t, and risk losing everything. Steve called it \u201cprotecting your downside.\u201d\nIn the last year or two, Zach left the company to run the family\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, with Eric Trump and Don Jr., which had raised $550 million through the sale of its \u201cgovernance tokens\u201d by March of this year. It doesn\u2019t appear to have affected his relationship with his brother. Zach lives just a seven-minute drive from Alex in a house on Miami Beach, with his wife and their newborn son, named Don James after the president. Alex visits frequently.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like me and Alex compete at all,\u201d Zach said. \u201cTo be honest with you, he was always much better at structuring real estate deals than I was.\u201d\nT\nhe crown\nThree years after Alex joined Witkoff Group, the company doubled down on South Florida following a pullback from the state in the wake of the financial crisis.\nIn 2021, developer Ari Pearl brought Steve, a known golf enthusiast, in on Shell Bay, a mixed-use condo, hotel and golf course project in Hallandale Beach. Alex has worked with Pearl on the development since then, as his father promoted him to co-CEO shortly after its inception. He tackled the day-to-day operations of the company, while Steve focused on the big-picture relationships.\nWitkoff also took over what became the Shore Club on Miami Beach after Witkoff\u2019s partner, Monroe Capital, foreclosed on the property, the development of which was canceled by Ziel Feldman and his now-defunct firm, HFZ Capital, in 2018.\nSince Witkoff\u2019s turn back to South Florida, \u201cI\u2019ve dealt much more with Alex than Steve,\u201d Niesen Kasdin, a former mayor of Miami Beach and now attorney and lobbyist, said. He\u2019s known Steve since before the Great Recession.\nBut Kasdin\u2019s first impression of Alex wasn\u2019t great. He thought the developer seemed young and arrogant, a new guy attempting to appear bigger than his britches.\n\u201cHe was very sure of himself and assertive about his ambitions,\u201d Kasdin said.\nHis notions changed once the two started on the details.\n\n\u201cAfter you work with him, you realize he is really that smart, and he really has a clear thought about what he\u2019s doing and how things should be handled,\u201d Kasdin said.\nAt the Shore Club, Alex ran the approval process for the building. It was arduous, according to Monroe Capital\u2019s Kyle Asher. Alex got\u00a0 the project through relatively unscathed, Asher said, even as it faced opposition from the neighboring Setai Resort and Residences.\nAsher credits Alex with bringing Auberge on as the hotel brand to anchor the Shore Club. Asher added that on One High Line in New York City, where they are also partners, Alex led sales and construction.\nAll the preparation meant that when November \u201924 arrived, Alex was already leading most of the firm\u2019s ongoing projects and had become the new point person for many of Steve\u2019s longtime contacts.\n\u201cWhat I do on a daily basis really didn\u2019t materially change all that much,\u201d Craig Murphy, the executive vice president of the firm\u2019s construction department, said. Murphy has worked with Steve since his days running Stellar Management with the late Larry Gluck; the two built a rental portfolio in the Bronx and Harlem before Steve went out on his own.\nB\nrick wall\nPut Alex in front of a crowd, and the accolades seem to exit stage left. In May, he sat by his father at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea at\nTRD\n\u2019s annual forum, on a panel about succession at the firm.\nAs the interview went on,\nTRD\n\u2019s publisher Amir Korangy noted that father and son were sticking to a script, and Steve was doing most of the talking.\n\u201cAlex, you can\u2019t give me a canned response,\u201d Korangy said, addressing the heir. \u201cI want your real, honest response.\u201d\nAlex keeps a tight grip on his image. He and Zach were raised to care about presentation: Important meetings warranted shaved faces and clean suits. Promising something meant following through. He\u2019d tell the kids: \u201cBe a man people can count on.\u201d\nPress coverage of Alex has stayed limited to one-off news about deals, project achievements and charitable contributions. A Google alert with his name turns up almost no results. Scheduling time with Alex and even connecting with others who know him was an exercise in getting the runaround. He canceled a photoshoot hours before start time because he hadn\u2019t brought a suit and didn\u2019t want to be pictured without one. When the sit-down with\nTRD\nfinally occurred, he tiptoed around such questions as the last time he, his brother and his dad were in the same room together; his most recent padel partners; and his personal strengths as a developer.\n\u201cMy job now is to be well rounded. It\u2019s not to be one dimensional,\u201d he finally said of his strengths.\nHis control extends to his dealings with agents.\n\u201cOf all the developers I\u2019ve ever worked with, and I don\u2019t say that lightly, he is the most present, in the sense that he\u2019s almost weirdly obsessed with what we do as real estate agents,\u201d Fredrik Eklund, co-founder of the top-producing Eklund-Gomes team at Douglas Elliman, said.\nEklund worked with Alex at Shell Bay and the Shore Club; Eklund purchased a unit at Shore Club. He described Alex as being \u201cintimately involved\u201d with not just every agent on the sales team, but even those who bring prospective buyers into the building.\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling me, \u2018Why hasn\u2019t so-and-so at Corcoran been at the sales office in the last month?\u2019\u201d Eklund said. \u201cThen he calls that person and says, \u2018Why haven\u2019t you done a deal?\u00a0 I thought you were so great. You haven\u2019t done a deal at one of my buildings lately.\u201d\nEklund characterized Alex as demanding. He\u2019s decisive, moved by results, not emotions. It\u2019s not personal, but \u201cif you\u2019re not producing, you\u2019re out,\u201d Eklund said. He doesn\u2019t befriend people he works with, he told Eklund.\nBut he\u2019s on the frontlines of reshaping Miami Beach. The firm\u2019s track record of iconic developments like 150 Charles in New York, where a financier just flipped his unit for $60 million \u2014 nearly double its purchase price \u2014 attracts the motivated.\nOne place Alex will admit he shines (others agree) is working with the City of Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board.\nThe board, whose decisions can make or break a project, holds rigorous standards, and plans often go through numerous rounds before they\u2019re greenlit. Alex spent a lot of time there in \u201921 and \u201922, when the Shore Club needed approval.\n\u201cPretty much every single discussion, every single community meeting, every single board hearing, every single thing, I personally became very involved in,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we call it a binary outcome. If you get approved, great. If you don\u2019t, not good.\u201d\nBut he wasn\u2019t done with the board after Shore Club\u2019s happy outcome. Moving to Miami Beach in 2020 earned him points with the preservation commission, which now trusts that he\u2019s embedded in the community, and the city even appointed him to the Ad Hoc Preservation Advisory Committee, a cohort of private sector members tasked with updating Miami Beach\u2019s preservation rules.\nA\nlex in his image\nAlex\u2019s ironclad walls might seem unusual for executives of his generation, who\u2019ve grown up alongside social media, their personal and professional lives displayed for mass consumption. Unless it\u2019s the opposite: a Gen Z attempt to edit and curate real life as if it were Instagram. Or, perhaps, in Alex\u2019s case, wanting control of his identity has a more timeless root \u2014 a son\u2019s reaction to having to fill his father\u2019s mammoth shoes in a risky industry where a couple bad moments can destroy it all.\nEveryone, including Alex, gets that Alex isn\u2019t Steve. He lacks Steve\u2019s signature magnetism, and his thinking is more methodical, step by step rather than top down. He\u2019s less interested in blurring the line between friends, clients and employees.\nBut being a carbon copy of his father isn\u2019t his aspiration, according to Corcoran CEO Pam Liebman, whose new development marketing firm is heading sales at One High Line. It\u2019s a dynamic Liebman is familiar with as the woman who stepped up after the legendary Barbara Corcoran.\nSteve is \u201cone of the greatest schmoozers of all time,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cSteve can just charm you and bring you into this Steve magic. Alex is not so interested in that. They get the same thing accomplished, but they do it in different ways.\u201d\nAlex is going to continue to build, he said, \u201cin the areas I think we\u2019re known for, whether it\u2019s purchasing distressed debt, taking over complex scenarios, new condominium projects and hospitality projects.\u201d He will also remain on the hunt for golf-related projects.\nBut his list of new frontiers is short and conservative: introducing new technology and looking for opportunities with data centers. He said the firm isn\u2019t limited to projects in New York and Miami, but of those two, he foresees a stronger push in South Florida.\nEven though he\u2019s on top of his game, the Witkoff Group a titan in the industry, Alex\u2019s vision for the future seems almost small compared to the earthshattering nature of Zach\u2019s crypto venture or Steve\u2019s world peace.\nBut, it\u2019s his.\nAsked whether Steve plans to come back after Trump\u2019s term, Alex made a typically cagey suggestion: We should find out from Steve. \u201cHe\u2019s divested from the company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think right now, he\u2019s just focused on his current position.\u201d",

        "content": "Even though the\nHamptons\ncan feel like a million miles \u2014 and dollars \u2014 away from the rest of the market, its residential scene couldn\u2019t avoid the same pitfalls as the rest of the country.\nThe year was off to a\nhot start\nfor the brokerages that rule Out East, but that was cut short by tariffs, stubborn interest rates and political instability.\n\u201cWe were really expecting 2025 to sort of be our climb back into a really strong market after the last couple of years,\u201d said Joe Fuer, Compass managing director in the Hamptons.\nInstead, after a first quarter that saw a number of firms posting double-digit year-over-year gains, the second quarter is where \u201cthings start to come undone,\u201d according to Andrew Saunders, the president of Saunders &amp; Associates.\nLow inventory and high interest rates continued to be bugaboos, and President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in mid-April added to the pressure on the market.\n\u201cWe did have a few deals that were almost at the finish line, and the buyers just lost confidence and didn\u2019t go through with those deals,\u201d Fuer said.\nA number of firms managed to post improved numbers from June 2024 to June 2025, as the top 10 brokerages racked up $10.2 billion across 2,580 deals. In the previous 12-month period, the top 10 firms had a sales volume of $7.3 billion across 1,830 deals. The rankings are based on\u00a0 both buy- and sell-side transactions over $1 million in that one-year period from publicly available listings and data provided by brokerages.\nWith more deals to go around, there was also more movement in the rankings. Compass, which posted $2.18 billion across 585 deals, knocked off Douglas Elliman\u2019s two-year reign as the top brokerage in the Hamptons. Elliman did $2.16 billion across 593 deals \u2014 good enough for second place.\n\u201cThere\u2019s basically 1,450 listings for sale, and we have over 2,000 brokers out here \u2014 you can imagine what a free-for-all it is.\u201d\nAndrew Saunders, Saunders &amp; Associates\nCorcoran jumped from fourth to third with about $1.5 billion across 383 deals, switching places with Saunders &amp; Associates, which did nearly $1.4 billion in sales across 426 deals. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty rounded out the top five with more than $1 billion in sales across 228 deals.\nThe top five brokerages changed places, but the same names managed to hold on to their status as the leading firms despite a number of new entrants to the market since the pandemic.\nSerhant and the Modlin Group were among the Manhattan-based brokerages that opened their own shops in the region, and a franchise under the Los Angeles-based Agency brand debuted in 2023.\n\u201cThose brokerages that came out here are still out here,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Todd Bourgard, the CEO of the brokerage\u2019s Long Island, Hamptons and North Fork regions. \u201cOf course, it changes the dynamic in the sense that they\u2019re taking a piece of the pie.\u201d\nBut Corcoran CEO Pam Liebman said that these new entrants may have a tough time making meaningful waves in the market if they\u2019re not careful about establishing local boots on the ground. The Hamptons, in her experience, aren\u2019t plug and play.\n\u201cSometimes brokers want to open in markets that have a high publicity value and sexy, expensive deals,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just splashing cash. It\u2019s a real business, and these are real homes for a lot of people.\u201d\nLuxury sales take the lead\nAs the summer of 2024 faded into the fall, residential brokerages in the Hamptons were trudging toward the end of the year. By the time December rolled around, the enclave\u2019s dossier of top deals was significantly lower than the previous year, with the 10 most expensive sales totaling $327 million compared to $511 million in 2023.\nAlthough the deal volume was lower at the very top, \u201cthe luxury segment was still really pushing that market along, of course, because it\u2019s less affected by higher interest rates,\u201d said Liebman.\nLiebman added that the lower end of the market struggled to keep pace, as buyers in that range are more susceptible to the pains that come with high mortgage rates and many of them plan to use their properties as investments, \u201cmaybe rent it out for a month or so.\u201d\n\u201cThe rental market was only okay, not amazing,\u201d she added.\nBut \u201cthe tone really shifted\u201d as 2024 turned to 2025, Liebman said. Within the first two months of the year, the Hamptons logged a $70 million deal for a waterfront estate in Amagansett. The 7-acre property at 370 and 372 Further Lane traded in two transactions after hitting the market last summer for $89 million, with brokers from Elliman and Sotheby\u2019s International brokering the sale.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a greater number of those so-called big money buyers right now floating around in the Hamptons,\u201d said Saunders.\nThe sale of a sprawling, half-built estate in Southampton closed in December for $40 million. The property at 1320 Meadow Lane had been on the market since 2018, when the seller halted construction plans. The listing was a co-exclusive with Corcoran\u2019s Tim Davis and Bespoke Real Estate, which ranked seventh with about $536 million across 48 deals.\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve seen more realistic seller expectations,\u201d said Bespoke co-founder Cody Vichinsky. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through the motions of trying to sell over the last several years in a high-rate, high- volatility environment\u201d to no avail. \u201cNow you\u2019re starting to see deals happen.\u201d\n\u201cOnce prices came down to a point where buyers recognize value, that\u2019s when they transacted,\u201d said Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nanette Hansen.\nThe broker cited the $29 million sale of 623 Halsey Neck Lane in Southampton, which dropped its asking price from $52 million to $34 million in April. Sotheby\u2019s Harald Grant and Corcoran\u2019s Tim Davis co-listed the property.\nAside from seller flexibility, Vichinsky said that buyers are also starting to pull the trigger on homes they\u2019ve been eyeing as they come to terms with a market that\u2019s still \u201ccompressed\u201d by a lack of inventory.\nDespite a few top-dollar deals at the start of the year, the Hamptons is still yearning for a nine-figure sale, which it hasn\u2019t seen since 2023, when Vichinsky\u2019s listing at 700 Meadow Lane closed for $112 million.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made many nine-figure offers this year,\u201d Vichinsky said. \u201cNobody wants to take it.\u201d\nThe Hamptons is a discretionary market, which means many of the homes bought and sold across the towns and hamlets on the East End are people\u2019s second, third, fourth or 10th property. Sellers typically don\u2019t have to part with their assets unless there\u2019s \u201cdivorce or distress,\u201d as Vichinsky put it.\n\u201cFrankly, [they] don\u2019t need the money,\u201d Vichinsky said.\nAn agent \u201cfree-for-all\u201d\nSeveral managers cited low inventory numbers as an issue that has continued to plague the Hamptons, bringing more competition for fewer listings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s basically 1,450 listings for sale, and we have over 2,000 brokers out here \u2014 you can imagine what a free-for-all it is,\u201d Saunders said.\nSome brokerages have responded by seeking new recruits from competitors, leading to a number of high-profile agents swapping shops.\n\u201cMy agents are getting calls from everybody out there every day,\u201d Fuer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very competitive.\u201d\nTwo of Elliman\u2019s top agents, mother-daughter duo Michaela and Paulina Keszler, left the brokerage for Sotheby\u2019s in December. Michaela Keszler placed 15th in\nTRD\n\u2019s latest ranking of the top agents in the Hamptons.\nAt the start of the summer, Terry Cohen, who previously led one of the top-producing teams at Hedgerow, jumped from the boutique brokerage to Compass. She joined the Hamptons\u2019 leading brokerage as an independent agent, leaving behind the remaining members of her team.\nIn July, Yorgos Tsibiridis, who\u2019d spent more than a decade at Compass in the Hamptons, jumped to Sotheby\u2019s as well.\nHansen said she thinks the added competition will only help in the long run.\n\u201cHaving more competition out here ultimately benefits sellers and landlords,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pie is big enough for all of us, and I think the cream rises to the top.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "There are just four months to go before New York picks three development teams for a downstate casino. The state has a Dec. 1 deadline for choosing winners and then plans to hand out licenses by the end of the year. With New York City real estate players involved in five of the eight proposals, huge housing and economic development projects lie in the balance. A specially created state board will select the victors, but the teams have spent July seeking approval from locals, through so-called Community Advisory Committees (CACs) that have to vote yay or nay by Sept. 30.\nHere are the projects pitched by each developer and the latest rundown of their status; here\u2019s even\nmore background\nfrom about the time the proposals were due.\nSL Green &amp; Caesars Entertainment \u2013 Times Square\nWhat\u2019s proposed: Caesars Palace Times Square, a $4B casino at 1515 Broadway with 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue run by Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation.\nThe odds: Faces opposition from Sen. Liz Krueger and possibly City Council member Erik Bottcher\nThe latest: CAC organizational meeting held on July 23.\nSoloviev Group &amp; Mohegan \u2013 Midtown East, near the U.N.\nWhat\u2019s proposed: $11B Freedom Plaza casino, with below-grade casino, 1,049 housing units (about half affordable) and green space\nThe odds: Lacks support from Assembly member Harvey Epstein; CEO Michael Hershman calls the team the underdogs\nThe latest: CAC organizational meeting held on July 17.\nSilverstein Properties, Rush Street Gaming &amp; Greenwood Gaming \u2013 West Side\nWhat\u2019s proposed: $7B casino called the Avenir, at West 41st Street and 11th Avenue with a 1,000-key hotel, small entertainment venue and 2,000 housing units pledged through office conversions\nThe odds: Faces opposition from Sen.

        "content": "A\u00a0new white brick office building sits vacant on a neglected corner of East 121st Street and Third Avenue in East Harlem, its front doors locked on a recent Friday. Six miles south, orange construction barricades and a chain link fence surround another boutique office development that is nearing completion and now seeking tenants.\nThese two buildings appear to be all that\u2019s left of Brandon Miller\u2019s family-owned real estate development company, Real Estate Equities Corporation, a year after his tragic death. Miller\u2019s July 3, 2024, suicide at his estate in the Hamptons exposed not only a\npersonal drama\nbut a tangled web of debts and real estate deals gone bad.\nWhile Miller\u2019s financial and legal problems grabbed headlines last summer and fall, his partner at REEC, Mark Seigel, remained silent. A password to REEC\u2019s website hid the firm\u2019s real estate projects from public view. Current and past employees, as well as brokers and lenders associated with projects, all declined to answer questions a full year later.\nBut some movement at the sites \u2014 construction, leasing efforts and loan transactions \u2014 gives a hint of how the company\u2019s strategic shift from residential and commercial building to an almost exclusive focus on office projects fared. The\npivot\ncame at a bad time, but the office market has since made a comeback, with new office inventory drying up and companies expanding. It\u2019s unclear whether that recovery came in time for Miller\u2019s projects.\nThe empty buildings, along with new lawsuits and the loss of two Manhattan development sites, add to the intrigue that continues to follow REEC.\nE\nast Harlem life sciences\nThe East Harlem office was REEC\u2019s last project developed before Miller\u2019s death. It has a new lender, but its future remains unclear.\nRaven Capital Management bought the loan secured by 2226 Third Avenue in July from Related Companies. The original loan amount was $40 million, but it is not known how much the investment management firm paid for the loan or how much outstanding debt there is.\n\u201cI think it was a good investment for them and they\u2019re hanging onto it for dear life.\u201d\nLawrence Khedouri, owner of land at REEC\u2019s 2226 Third Avenue office development\nREEC bought the leasehold for the property in 2020 for $27 million and developed a 10-story office building for life sciences tenants. It wrapped up construction on the 130,000-square-foot project in September 2023 and dubbed the development Labs @121. A CBRE team was handling leasing, according to the building\u2019s website.\nBut that website appears to have been taken down. Trash littered the sidewalk on a recent visit and the ground floor was vacant; the upper floors appeared to be vacant too. Seigel did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the building. Land owner Lawrence Khedouri said REEC is up to date on payments.\n\u201cI think it was a good investment for them and they\u2019re hanging onto it for dear life,\u201d Khedouri said.\nB\noutique office\nThere is more to see at an East Village office property developed by REEC, where leasing began early this year.\nWork appears nearly complete at 1 St. Mark\u2019s Place, a nine-story building with wraparound terraces and a curved brick and glass facade on the corner of Third Avenue. A JLL team is handling leasing, according to the building\u2019s website. A JLL spokesperson did not respond to a request for an update on leasing.\nREEC bought the leasehold on the property for $29 million from Edward Gabay and filed plans in 2018 to build a 53,000-square-foot office building entirely on spec. Before foundations were even dug, Madison Capital Realty tried\nforeclosing\non the property in 2021.\n\nParkview Financial rescued the project with a $70 million refinance the following year. At one point, REEC fell behind on loan payments at the project, Parkview Financial CEO Paul Rahimian said last summer. It was unclear whether REEC is currently up to date and Rahimian did not respond to recent requests for comment.\nTo add to REEC\u2019s headaches, the owner of a neighboring multifamily property sued the developer in April for failing to properly underpin the building during construction, allegedly causing \u201csignificant damage.\u201d\nB\nowery blowup\nThat isn\u2019t the only lawsuit REEC has faced since Miller\u2019s death. The owner of a Nolita property once slated for development by REEC sued the developer and its principals for abandoning an ill-fated office project at 156-166 Bowery Street.\nAri Zagdanski\u2019s Kinsmen Property Group\nclaims REEC owes more than $2.9 million in ground rent at the Bowery site, according to a lawsuit filed in March in state Supreme Court. Kinsmen is suing REEC, Seigel and Candice Miller, Brandon\u2019s wife and the\nadministrator of his estate\n.\nSeigel fired back at the lawsuit, claiming in an affidavit that REEC spent $4 million in costs related to architectural, engineering and permitting, and the landlord agreed to either a credit back or a portion of the equity under a new developer.\nREEC took over the leasehold for the 15,000-square-foot assemblage in February 2021 in a deal valued at $50 million and planned to build a six- or seven-story mixed-use office building.\nInstead, REEC failed to pay the ground rent or made partial payments for several months in 2024, Kinsmen\u2019s suit alleges. REEC also bailed on more than $600,000 in real estate taxes, which Kinsmen paid to avoid interest and penalties, the suit alleges. The landlord slapped REEC with a default notice last August and terminated REEC\u2019s ground lease in January.\nH\nighline hell\nAcross town, a long-vacant development site near the High Line\nonce owned\nby Miller recently found a buyer after years of drama surrounding the property.\nToll Brothers is in contract to buy 118 10th Avenue in Chelsea from Benny Barmapov for $53 million, a source familiar with the deal said. The deal comes after Barmapov took the property back from Miller, collapsed the ground lease and put it up for sale.\nREEC\nbought the leasehold\nfrom Barmapov in a January 2017 deal valued at $21 million and planned a 10-story, 100,000-square-foot office building with ground-floor retail. But the office project was never built and the leasehold changed hands again two years later when an entity tied to\nGDS Development Management and Swedish real estate firm Kl\u00f6vern AB\ntook it over.\nThe leasehold was transferred back to Miller in December 2023, and he stopped paying the ground lease in early 2024, Barmapov said.\nBefore his death, Miller\npledged his equity interests\nin the entity controlling the property to a company called DIA Family Holdings. A friend of Miller who lent him $1.5 million secured by Miller\u2019s interest in the property took control of the entity that owns the leasehold on the property and later\nfiled\nfor bankruptcy protection.\nWhen contacted about the pending sale, Barmapov said: \u201cLife goes on. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",

        "content": "On a muggy July afternoon in Cutchogue,\nThomas Juul-Hansen\nis deep in discussion with his team about a rogue beam.\nThe Danish-born architect is considering flattening the angled ceiling in the second-story hallway that leads to the primary bedroom of the home he\u2019s building, hiding a wooden beam that drops just below the rafters, which he calls a \u201cbit of a car crash.\u201d\nHis business partner, Johnny Donadic, and long-time friend and advisor Louis Buckworth, are proponents of maintaining the \u201cvernacular of the barn,\u201d as Donadic calls it.\n\u201cYou just witnessed genius,\u201d Buckworth says of the beam-related brainstorm. Juul-Hansen is walking the four of us through the property, where the building\u2019s wooden frame cuts a stark figure against the surrounding farmland and tangled web of trees and undergrowth.\nTheir hope is that each decision made since acquiring three adjacent plots of land facing the Long Island Sound in 2022 will justify a sale of what will be the most expensive spec home ever listed on the North Fork.\nJuul-Hansen, whose glasses tend to fall from his forehead to the bridge of his nose as he talks animatedly about one design aspect or another, is the face of the project. He made a name for himself with designs that shaped some of Manhattan\u2019s trophy condo buildings, including\nGary Barnett\u2019s One57 tower on Billionaires\u2019 Row\n.\nThe group rejects the term \u201cspec home,\u201d though most spec developers do. Much of the belief in what they\u2019re doing hinges on Juul-Hansen\u2019s ability to deliver a home that an end-user would have already spent millions on in renovations. Donadic, whose day job is as a high-end general contractor, grew up in the area and has quietly amassed his own impressive real estate portfolio on the North Fork.\n\u201cI know there is not a human being on the planet who could re-create this for the same price that we\u2019re going to sell it for,\u201d he said. (What that price will be is up for debate \u2014 the last estimate the developers offered to The Real Deal was $10 million.)\nJuul-Hansen, who is wiry with intense blue eyes, vacillates from self-deprecation to, in his own words, arrogance. \u201cI\u2019m a very hard critic of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I think we\u2019re making something spectacular, it\u2019s because it\u2019s fucking spectacular.\u201d\nIt is the pair\u2019s first foray into residential development. After years of charging developers for their services, they are now on the other side of the ledger as 50-50 equity partners, with a single construction loan for financing.\nBut aside from themselves, Juul-Hansen and Donadic are also betting on the area as a whole, and that what they\u2019re building will look like a steal come five years from now.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a first,\u201d Juul-Hansen said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that hasn\u2019t been done before, but it should be done.\u201d\nA\ntight squeeze\nIf there is one thing backing up the developers\u2019 bet, it\u2019s the rapidly appreciating value of the land on the North Fork. And how little of it there is to go around.\nThe area, which starts 75 miles east of Manhattan and stretches 30 miles farther in that direction toward Orient Point, has long been known more for its charming cottages and vast acres of farmland than the grand compounds and crowded nightlife of its Southern neighbor, the Hamptons.\nFor a long time, the North Fork\u2019s more chilled reputation extended to its home values, which remained stable as developers rushed to buy up every buildable parcel of land on the South Fork.\nBut as city dwellers fled for greener pastures in the wake of the pandemic\nthe North Fork became a destination in its own right\nand home values skyrocketed from 2020 onward. Juul-Hansen and Donadic seized on the wave of interest, scooping up over 11 acres across three plots for $4 million in 2022, which already looks to be a deal as median home prices have jumped another 22 percent to $1.1 million this year.\n\u201cThe timing was great,\u201d said Juul-Hansen.\n\u201cTwenty-foot ceiling heights does not say humble to me.\u201d\nluxury broker Louis Buckworth, on the planned $10M+ North Fork spec home\nTwo of the plots are waterfront, while the third, where construction on the first home is underway, abuts their southern borders and faces over 32 acres of preserved farmland. (The 7,000-square-foot home will be on the non-waterfront plot, and the group has been cagey about the other two plots \u2014 at the moment, the plan is for Juul-Hansen and Donadic to each take one for personal use.)\nA narrow strip of gravel driveway runs three-quarters of a mile from Oregon Road down to the plots, which Buckworth says \u201cwould be the most immaculate drive\u201d once it\u2019s lined with trees, adding the outside entry to the group\u2019s tendency to talk in superlatives when referring to the home.\nLand like this, zoned residentially, is not easy to come by in the Town of Southold, which has already preserved over 10,000 acres according to the town\u2019s website. Only two residential parcels are currently listed for sale, one of which is less than an acre and neither of which is on the water, according to data provided by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Melissa Principi.\n\n\u201cIf you can find a new build ground-up, it\u2019s rare,\u201d Principi said. \u201cBuyers are willing to pay a premium for brand-new, and I\u2019ve been seeing, for the most part, that it\u2019s working.\u201d\nThe Town of Southold, which spans from Laurel to the tip of the island, has also cracked down on development opportunities as builders have eyed the area\u2019s untouched farmland. In 2022, the town passed a series of zoning reforms limiting the gross floor area by lot size, hamstringing developers looking to go big or fill a plot with multiple homes.\n\u201cEven if you had six acres, most of the time, it would have to stay 70 percent open space,\u201d Principi said. \u201cYou\u2019re really, maybe only going to get two homes if you\u2019re a spec builder on those six acres.\u201d\nA\n\u201chumble\u201d home\nFor Juul-Hansen, there\u2019s no reason to cram the lot that makes up 6023 Oregon Road with as much square footage as possible \u2014 that\u2019s for the Hamptons.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to find a way to fit in by trying to make our work vernacular without making it look like it\u2019s something that was built 200 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have built a 25,000-square-foot house on this lot if we wanted, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the North Fork is about.\u201d (He later clarified this was hyperbole, but that he did not come close to maxing out the allowable floor area).\nThat means balancing out a desire to match the understated nature of the North Fork with building something that is also unrivaled for the area.\nJuul-Hansen in an interview called the project a \u201chumble house,\u201d at which point Buckworth jumped in to clarify the remark.\n\u201cTwenty-foot ceiling heights does not say humble to me,\u201d said Buckworth, a seasoned luxury broker who has led high-end projects like Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 520 Park Avenue. (The ceilings are in fact 22 feet high in the living room.)\n\u201cEven though the dollar amount might be super high because they\u2019re a piece of art, they will fit with the landscape so beautifully and seamlessly,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Sheri Winter Parker, who sold the land to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s what a high-end North Fork buyer is looking for.\u201d\nAt the property, which the team hopes to complete by spring 2026, Juul-Hansen walks through his vision: the glass-doored four-car garage for car aficionados squeezed for space in the city, the double-height living room separated from the kitchen by a two-sided fireplace and the windows by German specialty manufacturer Sch\u00fcco that have just been installed.\nThe property has many similarities to Juul-Hansen\u2019s own home just five minutes away, which he built and moved into in 2022, from the travertine finishes in the bathrooms and pool deck siding to the bleached oak flooring. He is banking on a buyer that doesn\u2019t want \u201cthe show and the scene\u201d of the Hamptons, but \u201cwho may be very, very wealthy.\u201d\n\u201cThey want what I want,\u201d he said of his ideal buyer. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the creative world, like myself, who appreciate that sort of humble setup, even if it is possibly extraordinarily expensive.\u201d\nA\nnew North Fork\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Juul-Hansen\u2019s partner on the project is Donadic, who also has a house in the area and in recent years has laid the groundwork for making the area more palatable to a new class of buyer.\nDonadic, along with a group of local investors, has bought up and revitalized North Fork Table, a farm-to-table restaurant in Southold, and The Shoals, a bayfront 20-room hotel. Juul-Hansen worked on both projects, which have reopened in the past few years.\n\u201cYou guys are just showing off,\u201d Buckworth says as the group of us cruises from the restaurant to the hotel in his Range Rover.\nBut at The Shoals, sitting at a picnic table overlooking the Shelter Island Sound, Donadic points out that while their Oregon\u00a0 Road project is \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d so was the hotel and North Fork Table. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for it,\u201d he says.\nRecent sales and listings bode well for their goals. A spec home on Shelter Island asking $15 million went into contract in the middle of July, which would be a record sale on the patch of land less than a mile from where we\u2019re sitting (\u201cOur house is a steal,\u201d Juul-Hansen texted later when I sent him the listing).\nTwo other bayside waterfront properties recently hit the market asking $12 and $23 million, respectively, although it remains to be seen what they actually trade. Off the water, Winter Parker is trying to sell a 148-acre estate for $36 million, nearly double what it went for in 2008.\nNone of those are being shopped as spec homes, though, leaving Juul-Hansen and Donadic in uncharted waters.\n\u201cPeople are extraordinarily fearful of doing what we\u2019re doing, and correctly so, because it hasn\u2019t been done,\u201d he says.\nBut minutes later when he assesses what he and Donadic are creating, he wonders: \u201cHow can we fucking lose?\u201d",

        "content": "For over a century, the\nHamptons\nhave been known as a summer escape for the American affluent, a bucolic dream of old money, wood-shingled estates and white linen wardrobes. The farmers hocking their wares at roadside stands are staples in this vision of the South Fork, harkening back to when its primary industry and identity was agrarian. Land was for growing things, not for parcelling into multi-million-dollar spec homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this prized Americana vibe of farmstand culture here, it is unlike anywhere else in the country,\u201d Katie Baldwin, a farmer and co-founder of Amagansett farm Amber Waves, said. \u201cPeople have told me, \u2018I moved to Amagansett for Amber Waves.\u2019\u201d\nBaldwin and her co-founder Amanda Merrow\u2019s farm is a household name 17 years into farming, their trucker hats considered a status symbol with a certain Manhattan set. They\u2019re not alone \u2014 Balsam Farms in Amagansett, Milk Pail in Water Mill, Pike Farm in Sagaponack and Round Swamp Farm, with shops in Bridgehampton, East Hampton and Montauk, have all built cult-like followings among the rich, the famous and the influencers. Produce grown in the well-drained glacial soil fills their baskets, alongside prepared foods whose prices seem not to have ceilings.\n(In the case of Round Swamp, former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel, who recently sold her Bridgehampton home for $5.2 million, has racked up millions of views on TikTok\njust for raving\nabout the farm\u2019s chicken salad.)\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, that\u2019s a rare level of celebrity for farmstands.\nThat renown is in part thanks to prices that make most people gawk \u2014 a $30 two-quart container of berries, $120 lobster salad and $400 melons.\n\u201cPeople love farm field views.\u201d\nKieran Brew, Serhant agent\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to read that news coverage,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cEven if it looks easy, everyone is paddling like hell underneath.\u201d\nIn fact, once the economics come into focus, $400 barely seems enough for melon in a place where billionaires buy dirt for millions. Farms have to sell enough product in the mad dash from Memorial Day to Labor Day to sustain them through the rest of the year, and they have to do this on what you\u2019d think would be some of the most expensive land in the country.\nYet over four decades, farmers, conservation advocates, local governments and private citizens have banded together to create extreme land use restrictions that effectively devalue land to the point where it remains affordable to farmers and unappealing to anyone else. This, in turn, restricts the supply of homes and inflates values of properties adjacent to protected farmland. It\u2019s no silver bullet, but the careful honing of development code has protected the pastoral fantasy of the Hamptons, and the supply of expensive local strawberries.\nThe close view of how it all works is much less appealing than the displays of blueberries and heirloom tomatoes that draw the fans in.\n\u201cA lot of times when I talk about this, people\u2019s eyes glaze over,\u201d said Merrow. \u201cIt\u2019s how we exist out here.\u201d\nF\nallow fields\nLots of farmers have to navigate rising housing costs, labor costs, general economic uncertainty and a radical shift in the agricultural business. Bad weather or a bad crop could make the business go haywire. It is all high-risk \u2014 to tend the fields is to walk a tightrope.\nBut the biggest challenge in the South Fork is real estate.\nAs American wealth has grown, particularly in New York City, so too has the demand for homes in the Hamptons.\nProperty values have never been higher on the East End. Urban flight during the pandemic sent the market into a frenzy, and while it eventually mellowed, the new floor for pricing stayed. In January, Southampton\u2019s 4-acre La Dune estate at 366 and 376 Gin Lane sold at auction for\n$88.5 million\n. In February, an oceanfront estate at 370 and 372 Further Lane in Amagansett sold for\n$70 million\n.\nThat\u2019s not quite in budget for an upstart farmer. But even on the lower end, land in the Hamptons is out of reach. According to LandSearch, the average asking price for an acre of undeveloped land in East Hampton is $2.4 million. The average price for an acre of farmland in New York state is $2,525, according to AcreTrader, a farmland investment platform.\nTo make land affordable for the farmers, the towns of Southampton and East Hampton and conservation groups like the Peconic Land Trust devised a set of tools to effectively strip the value from the earth. It included a push to buy development rights for land, which restricts building on properties.\nThe purchases are financed with the Peconic Bay Transfer Tax, a 2 percent tax on real estate transactions that funnels directly into the Community Preservation Fund, or CPF. The booming real estate market means there\u2019s plenty of cash on hand.\n\u201cEast Hampton is fortunate to have high liquidity,\u201d Merrow said. In addition to running Amber Waves, she sits on the board of the Peconic Land Trust and East Hampton\u2019s CPF Advisory Board. \u201cThe town has a lot of power to move quickly.\u201d\nWith the funding, East Hampton closed one of the largest non-commercial deals of 2024, dropping\n$56 million\non 30 acres at 66 Wainscott Main Street from billionaire beauty heir Ronald Lauder.\nLauder had bought the land for $66 million in 2021 with the intention of preventing development. While land preservation is a lofty goal, it\u2019s also often a self-serving one. Kieran Brew, an agent with Serhant, said homes adjacent to agricultural reserves can see anywhere from a 15 to 20 percent premium.\n\u201cPeople love farm field views,\u201d he said. Lauder owns a home adjacent to the Wainscott Main Street parcel, according to published reports.\nNo matter the reason, private citizens looking to preserve land are a boon to farmers, the town and the trust. But plenty of sellers eschew altruism in favor of the best offer. That\u2019s where the towns run into trouble, as it can\u2019t legally pay more than the appraised value.\n\n\u201cProperties change hands for more than appraised value all the time,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cIf you have a family who wants to sell to the highest bidder, then it could be the town in competition with a developer.\u201d\nIn cases where the town comes up short, the trust and private donors step in. That\u2019s how the trust pulled off the $48 million purchase of 27 acres of Topping Farm in Bridgehampton last year, according to published reports. The land at 181 and 305 Halsey Lane was listed for\n$70 million\nin 2023, and marketed as a development site for up to eight homes.\nThe trust cobbled together $18 million of donations, including from former Coach CEO Lew Frankfort, to buy the tracts, and Southampton\u2019s CPF contributed $30 million to buy the development rights. As part of the deal, the restrictions on the land go beyond simply \u201cno mansions.\u201d It cannot be utilized as a tree farm, horse farm or a winery, and it cannot sit fallow. This is what\u2019s known as an affirmative farming covenant, and it\u2019s how the towns and trust are keeping farmland out of private estates.\nS\nharpening the tools\nThe affirmative farming covenant is the final boss of land use restrictions. It ensures that the land will produce food in perpetuity, and is coupled with protections that restrict the resale value. Between the mandate to farm and the knee-capped price growth, it is one of the only ways to make acreage in the Hamptons unappealing to the uber-rich seasonal residents.\nIt also finally brings down the price per acre to within reach of farmers, according to John v.H. Halsey, the founder and president of the Peconic Land Trust. In the case of the Topping Farm land, the trust is working on selling it to farmers from its apprenticeship program for $26,000 an acre, Halsey confirmed, down from the $1.8 million an acre the trust paid.\nThe covenant emerged as a response to an unpredicted outcome of the Hamptons\u2019 first efforts to preserve farmland. Even with development restricted, wealthy owners shocked the farmers and the towns with how they used the parcels.\n\u201cWe grow it, make it, bake it and sell it.\u201d\nKatie Baldwin, Amber Waves\n\u201cI can think of three baseball diamonds that are on ag reserves,\u201d Halsey said. Private vineyards, equestrian facilities and sprawling lawns are allowed on protected land without an affirmative farming covenant. Halsey estimated protected land can sell for as much as $300,000 an acre, too much for a farmer but a bargain to nearly every other Hamptons buyer.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not bound by the economics of agriculture,\u201d he said.\nBut as anyone in real estate knows, land is worth what a buyer is willing to pay.\n\u201cAt the start of these conservation tools, there wasn\u2019t foresight that there would be this market for land that you can\u2019t even build on,\u201d Merrow said. Very quickly, \u201cthe land trust and the towns started to see that land that was intended to be set aside for agriculture was leaving production, laying fallow.\u201d No new homes, perhaps, but also no fertile fields.\nG\none with the potatoes\nBefore everything was berries and lobster salad, the fields sprouted potatoes.\n\u201cIn the \u201980s, everything was potatoes,\u201d Dan Heston, director of agricultural programs with the Peconic Land Trust said, explaining that Long Island has some of the best, most acidic soil for potato growing in the country. Forget Idaho: \u201cThe potatoes want to grow out here.\u201d\nHeston, a farmer, remembers when Long Island potato growers wholesaled their crop to large distributors, he said. But it got too expensive to ship the spuds out, and the business of farming was changing. Nationally, the number of farms has dropped from a peak of 6.8 million in 1935, to 1.9 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The American Farmland Trust estimates 2,000 acres of farmland are lost to non-agricultural uses every day. Baldwin sees the East End as a microcosm of the dire national portrait of American farming. Many family farms, including in the Hamptons, lose acreage to the federal inheritance tax every year.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a million dollars to pay in taxes,\u201d Merrow said of local family farmers. \u201cAll of their wealth is in their farmland.\u201d\nTo survive, Hamptons farmers have shifted their strategies.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s desperation,\u201d Heston said. \u201cYou get really clever.\u201d\nTheir plans run the gamut from adding farmer\u2019s markets or trying community-supported agriculture memberships where customers pre-pay for a share of the season\u2019s yield. Other farmers have discovered that value-add products like cheese, baked goods, preserves and sauces are where the money can be made.\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the market in house,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe grow it, make it, bake it and sell it. It\u2019s a more sustainable business model.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also picking fruit and vegetables higher on the price pyramid.\n\u201cPeople are transitioning into crops that have the highest value per acre,\u201d Merrow said. \u201cCucumbers and baby greens and heirloom tomatoes \u2014 things that are beautiful and expensive.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the final piece of the puzzle, and the detail that inspired the headlines in the first place.\nFarms in the Hamptons depend on patrons paying $25 for a bag of granola and $18 for a jar of local honey. And of course they\u2019ll pay, especially after the millions of dollars spent by the town and donors to keep the farms around. Because the existence of the farms, with their cracking heirloom tomatoes set on worn wooden shelves, their pies coming out of the oven, is part of what makes this one of the most expensive luxury real estate markets in the country. Residents spend millions on homes just so that they can pop into the local farmstand on their way to the beach. It\u2019s a luxury.\n\u201cThe East End of Long Island has always been about the farms,\u201d Trotter said. \u201cPeople just want to preserve that.\u201d",

        "content": "In a closed-door meeting last month, Tishman Speyer\u2019s Rob Speyer had some questions for Zohran Mamdani.\nSpeyer asked about Mamdani\u2019s proposal to\nfreeze rents\nfor stabilized apartments, drilling down on the fact that such a move could discourage construction of rental buildings and\nplunge older housing stock\ninto further distress.\nThis was the Democratic mayoral nominee\u2019s first attempt to make his pitch to business leaders. Mamdani spoke with members of the Partnership for New York City, a consortium of business executives that includes some of the biggest names in the real estate industry.\nFor most of the organization\u2019s members, this was the first time that they\u2019d met Mamdani. According to\nPartnership CEO Kathy Wylde\n, the answers weren\u2019t a total flop.\nMamdani, per Wylde\u2019s telling, recognized the need to reexamine the city\u2019s property tax system, which has long been criticized for saddling multifamily properties with a disproportionate tax burden, and that a rent freeze would need to be combined with some relief for property owners.\n\u201cI think he responded in a way that could have given some comfort,\u201d she said.\nBut one meeting isn\u2019t going to change years\u2019 worth of fears the industry has about socialist leaders guiding New York policy. And although avenues of communication are beginning to open, the question remains whether Mamdani will actually listen to what real estate has to say.\n\u201cMamdani\u2019s diagnosis of our affordability crisis is correct, but I am concerned that some of his proposed solutions could make things worse, especially for working people,\u201d RXR CEO Scott Rechler said in an email.\nRechler, who wasn\u2019t at the closed-door meeting, noted that a \u201cmajor concern\u201d remains Mamdani\u2019s \u201cinability to directly condemn antisemitism\u201d and felt comments the Democratic nominee made during the Partnership meeting were a continuation of that. During the meeting, Mamdani pledged to discourage the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d used by some opponents of the war in Gaza, which some have interpreted as a call for violence against Jewish people, Gothamist reported.\nFor real estate specifically, the political and professional divides are likely more pronounced. Wylde said that executives in other sectors might not feel as threatened by Mamdani as real estate. They realize that much of what affects their business \u2014 such as, say, raising the corporate tax rate, as Mamdani has proposed \u2014 is outside the mayor\u2019s authority.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want the industry\u2019s support.\u201d\nanonymous developer now supporting Mamdani\n\u201cReal estate decisions are almost always made locally,\u201d she said.\nStill, Mamdani\nhas said\nhe supports streamlining the city\u2019s land use review process and curbing the ability of individual City Council members to\nkill\nrezonings, two ideas that developers can get behind. His pledge to freeze rents and raise taxes? Not so much.\n\nThe prospect of a Democratic Socialist leading New York City drove many real estate executives to pour money into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign. After Cuomo\u2019s loss in the Democratic primary, many have turned back to Mayor Eric Adams and are supporting his reelection bid in earnest.\nRechler donated $250,000 to the super PAC tied to Cuomo. After the primary, he said he was open to supporting Adams.\nLast month, Adams reported $1.5 million in contributions from June 10 to July 11, a majority of which he received after the primary. Donors working in the real estate or construction sector put in upwards of $480,000 during that time (which on its own was more than the $460,000-plus he raised from all donors between Jan. 12 and June 9). Real estate executives, including SL Green CEO Marc Holliday, have held fundraisers for Adams. Employees of the real estate investment trust gave the mayor more than $67,000, records show.\n\u201cVoters are looking at the alternative and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t afford to go backwards,\u2019\u201d Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams, said after the donations were made public.\nThe New York Apartment Association\u2019s super PAC spent more than $2.5 million supporting Cuomo\u2019s campaign. After his loss, the group didn\u2019t commit to a new candidate.\nAt this point, the organization is \u201cjust observing\u201d as the lead-up to the general election takes shape, said Kenny Burgos, CEO of NYAA. The group remains concerned about Mamdani\u2019s policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that his No. 1 policy would be the nail in the coffin,\u201d Burgos said.\nSome real estate professionals have publicly\nsupported\nMamdani, though their campaign donations total a fraction of what Cuomo and Adams have amassed. In the latest round of donations, Mamdani reported more than $6,500 from people who indicated that they worked in real estate, construction, architecture or in a housing-related occupation, though most in that bucket described their job as residential brokers, nonprofit or public housing specialists or as self-employed.\nOne developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is supporting Mamdani now that he is the Democratic nominee. The developer noted that being an Assembly member for a few terms likely isn\u2019t adequate preparation to lead the city, but he\u2019s hopeful Mamdani will surround himself with experienced people and get himself up to speed.\n\u201cI think he has a big learning curve, but I also think he\u2019s a smart guy,\u201d the developer said.\nAlthough the developer doesn\u2019t think Mamdani is trying to court the real estate industry \u2014 doing so could alienate his base \u2014 the candidate has shown that he\u2019s open to its concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want the industry\u2019s support,\u201d the developer said. \u201cHe does seem to be out trying to speak to everyone he can to understand what the issues are.\u201d\nOthers similarly pray that, if elected, Mamdani will at least have an open ear. Rechler said that he hopes that if Mamdani becomes mayor, he won\u2019t \u201ccompletely reject the private sector\u201d and will find ways to \u201charness its innovation, discipline, and capital.\u201d\nAfter Mamdani met with the Partnership, Adams took his turn with executives. Wylde described his speech as compelling, saying that the mayor framed the race in a way that many in the crowd have come to view it, as a fight against a movement and an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d",

        "content": "The conventional wisdom in New York City real estate is that cash is king.\nAt the high end of the market, as deals climb into eight- and nine-figure numbers, more buyers have been foregoing financing. Since the start of 2025, 60 percent of sales in Manhattan were all cash, the highest share of all the boroughs, according to Property Shark\u2019s\nlatest report\n.\nBut the outer boroughs are a different story. Staten Island had the largest share of financed deals, with 77 percent of sales including a mortgage. In the Bronx, 60 percent of home sales were backed by loans, and in Queens, two out of three purchases were financed.\nEven in Brooklyn \u2014 where demand for homes has skyrocketed in the last five years, prices have reached record heights and luxury new developments are reshaping popular neighborhoods \u2014 mortgage-backed purchases accounted for two-thirds of home sales since the start of the year.\nThough the discussion of cash buyers largely focuses on the luxury market, they\u2019re also concentrated at the lowest end, with most sales under $250,000 across the city going to cash buyers.\nThe neighborhoods where non-financed sales reigned supreme also point to the cash concentration at the ends of the market, which correlates to the types of buyers purchasing with cash: high-net worth individuals scooping up homes in the city\u2019s priciest neighborhoods, those buying for investment purposes and longtime local buyers.\nIn Noho and Central Park South in Manhattan, cash buyers accounted for 93 percent and 85 percent of deals, respectively. In Breezy Point and Glen Oaks in the Bronx, all-cash purchases accounted for 100 percent and 85 percent of deals, respectively.\nNot so fast\u2026\nHeadline-grabbing price tags aren\u2019t just for Billionaires\u2019 Row.\n\nEarlier this week, a mansion in Bay Ridge hit the market asking $25 million \u2014 more than three times more expensive than the neighborhood\u2019s priciest sale on record. No home in the waterfront community has come close to nabbing such a hefty deal, and it\u2019s miles ahead of the second most expensive listing, a sprawling eight-bedroom home with a pool.\nIf local history is any indication, the home is not likely to garner such an expensive sale. A nearby mansion in Mill Basin, infamous for its ties to a Russian oligarch and a cameo in the Academy Award-winning film Anora, traded for just $10 million in 2018 after an initial $30 million asking price. When it sold again in 2021, it did so at a roughly\n$3 million loss\n.\nHowever,\u00a0 the Bay Ridge home\u2019s eyebrow-raising number \u2014 coupled with gilded interiors reminiscent of Versailles \u2014 has earned it coverage in\nThe Real Deal,\nthe New York Times and the New York Post.\nNew York City real estate is no stranger to\npie-in-the-sky pricing\nto attract attention for listings with the hopes of driving traffic, and eventually, snagging a deal. Some of the most egregious examples have been on Billionaires\u2019 Row, including at Central Park Tower, where developer Gary Barnett once listed the pinnacle penthouse for $250 million.\nBarnett admitted that his sellout target for the building as a whole was too high, after the building started offloading units for significant discounts. He also cut the price of the penthouse down to $195 million before pulling it off the market completely. It hasn\u2019t returned since, nor has it found a buyer.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nA condo atop the Plaza Hotel, which closed for $18.9 million, was the most expensive deal to hit the city register this week. Unit 409 at 1 Central Park West was\nonce the home\nof architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who lived in the former hotel suite while he designed the Guggenheim Museum.\nThe four-bedroom apartment was sold by Galerie magazine founder Lisa Cohen and her husband, Hudson Capital Properties founder James Cohen. The couple bought the 4,000-square-foot unit for $13 million in 2009 and renovated it.\n",

        "content": "A Renaissance Revival townhouse in Harlem once owned by Bob Dylan is on the market for $3 million.\nThe five-story, 4,500-square-foot home at 265 West 139th Street sits on Strivers\u2019 Row, the landmarked stretch of late-1800s townhomes that once formed the heart of Harlem\u2019s Black professional elite. Records show Dylan owned the property from 1986 until 2000, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n, though little is publicly known about his time there.\nStan Ponte and Colin Montgomery of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing, which comes out to about $667 per square foot.\nCurrent owners Isam Salah, a retired attorney, and Elaina Richardson, a former editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, bought the home in 2018 for $3.17 million. Though they say Dylan\u2019s legacy wasn\u2019t a factor in their purchase, the connection has drawn low-key attention from tour groups and curious passersby.\n\u201cDo you know Bob Dylan used to live in your house?\u201d people sometimes ask, Salah said. \u201cYes, we know,\u201d he said with a laugh.\nThe couple renovated the five-bedroom home after buying it, preserving original woodwork and tile while adding soundproof windows, modern bathrooms and an updated outdoor deck. Historic features include a wood-paneled vestibule, Palladian windows in the dining room and a four-foot-tall safe now used as a bar.\n\nThe listing comes as the Harlem townhouse market remains sluggish. Prices and sales have lagged since the pandemic, with buyers now largely preferring turnkey homes over fixer-uppers, according to Montgomery.\nRichardson, who now runs an arts retreat in Saratoga Springs, said the couple is shifting their life upstate and wants to see the house lively again.\n\u201cWe both began to feel sort of sorry for the house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should have a lot of life in it. I had this Mrs. Dalloway feeling of, \u2018You should have a party.\u2019\u201d\nDylan, who famously moved to New York in the 1960s and drew inspiration from Harlem\u2019s jazz and blues scene, released \u201cSpanish Harlem Incident\u201d in 1964. His former home is now one of the few in the area still holding on to its original character and, maybe, a verse or two of history.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s office market is heating up again.\nTenants inked deals for 3 million square feet in July, up almost 11 percent from June, according to a new Colliers report. Telecom titan Verizon inked the month\u2019s largest lease, a\n199,000-square-foot deal\nat Vornado\u2019s Penn 2. Law firm Latham &amp; Watkins grabbed the second-largest, 119,000 square feet at RXR\u2019s 1285 Sixth Avenue.\nAll in all, the borough is on track for 40 million square feet of leasing activity by year\u2019s end \u2014 a level not seen since the pre-pandemic heyday of 2019, according to Colliers. Overall, Manhattan\u2019s availability shrank to 15.2 percent, the lowest since January 2021. Sublet supply continued its downward trend, hitting its leanest level in five years.\nBut it\u2019s not all champagne and confetti. Despite the recent uptick, demand was down 22 percent year-over-year. That\u2019s largely due to Blackstone\u2019s 1 million square foot extension and expansion at 345 Park Avenue last July, which accounted for 25 percent of that month\u2019s demand.\nBut while some neighborhoods are sizzling, others \u2014 like Downtown \u2014 are still playing catch-up.\n\n\u201cThe sheer amount of positive absorption we\u2019ve seen in the market over the last four years really is telling as far as to what degree the market and the supply is really beginning to recover,\u201d said Franklin Wallach, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cSome areas of Manhattan are much closer to it than others.\u201d\nMidtown roared back last month with 1.3 million square feet of leasing activity, up by a third from June. The availability rate dropped below 14 percent, the tightest it\u2019s been since 2020. The average asking rents basically stayed the same at $79 per square foot.\nMidtown South was a surprise winner, tying with Midtown in leasing volume. Demand was driven by Verizon\u2019s anchor lease and Sigma Computing\u2019s\n64,000-square-foot deal\nat SL Green\u2019s 1 Madison Avenue. Asking rents climbed slightly to almost $78 per square foot. But Midtown South still has the biggest increase in supply compared to March 2020, with 29 million square feet left to fill.\nDowntown continued to lag, locking in just 375,000 square feet, down by half from June. But it still fared better than the 183,000 square feet from a year earlier.\n",

        "content": "It takes serious imagination to envision dropping a 16-story indoor ski slope near swampland in South Florida. That\u2019s why the Ghermezian family, owners of the three largest shopping centers in North America, may be the only developers willing and able to pull it off.\nThe ski slope is among the entertainment centerpieces of the Ghermezians\u2019 plan to transform roughly 175 acres of barren land, tucked between two major highways in Miami-Dade County, into their biggest theme park mall yet.\nTriple Five, led by cousins Paul and Don Ghermezian, has long planned to develop\nAmerican Dream Miami,\na $4 billion, 6 million-square-foot entertainment and retail center. In addition to the ski slope, the project will feature a water park, 3-D cinema multiplex, 2,000 hotel rooms, and other theme park attractions. Bigger than the Ghermezians\u2019 Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, American Dream Miami would be the nation\u2019s largest indoor theme park mall.\nBut it is going to take more imagination and a lot more risk for the Ghermezians to actually deliver on their vision, and prevent their latest entertainment-and-retail dream from evaporating.\nIn recent years, the family has focused on getting the American Dream theme park mall in New Jersey on stable footing.\nAs a result, the Miami version seems like an afterthought, where the Ghermezians are tied up in legal fights with Miami-Dade County and the Graham Companies, a Miami Lakes-based development firm that agreed to sell 64 acres to Triple Five, which it needs for the project. Triple Five owns roughly 110 acres.\nThrough a spokesperson, Paul and Don Ghermezian declined interview requests for this story. In an interview for\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMarch issue\n, Paul Ghermezian acknowledged American Dream Miami was on the backburner. The project was previously supposed to open in 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very long-term players,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are passive projects.\u201d\nThe biggest hurdle for Triple Five is lifting the county\u2019s ban on seeking subsidies to help pay for road construction for the American Dream Miami site, including a new interchange connecting to Interstate 75, one of the highways near the planned development. The county could lift the ban, come September.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just working through all the entitlement and infrastructure things that need to go in,\u201d Paul Ghermezian said in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we have the water and sewage [connections] and [expressway] interchanges.\u201d\nR\noad work\nIn 2018, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved rezoning 175 acres from industrial to commercial uses, and entered into a development agreement with\nTriple Five\nthat required the developer to obtain state and federal approvals for on and exit ramps from the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 75, as well as the construction of local roads.\nThe developer secured $75 million in state funding for the construction of the Florida Turnpike interchange, as well as to purchase a right-of-way for the state to be able to build it, Triple Five\u2019s spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. The new interchange is scheduled for completion later this year.\nTriple Five also turned over 24 acres to the Florida Department of Transportation for the I-75 interchange. But the $425 million road project cannot happen unless the county rescinds the ban on funding the construction of local roads serving American Dream Miami.\n\u201cIn the context of a large development, the $5 million penalty may not be a huge thing.\u201d\nShlomo Chopp, Case Equity Partners\n\u201cThere is no point in building I-75 MGD Interchanges if it would be a road to nowhere,\u201d the Triple Five statement reads. \u201cThe County needs the I-75 interchange to be built, regardless of the American Dream Miami project, to relieve acute and worsening traffic congestion and to allow the larger area to be developed.\u201d\nWhen American Dream Miami was approved, Triple Five competitors\nSimon Property Group\n, Taubman Centers and General Growth Properties formed a coalition that successfully lobbied Miami-Dade County commissioners to include the road funding ban. The coalition\u2019s strategy knee-capped Triple Five\u2019s ambitions to quickly get started on building American Dream Miami.\nSince then, the Ghermezians found an ally on the commission willing to reverse the ban. Commissioner Juan Carlos Bermudez, who was elected in 2022 to represent the district where American Dream Miami will be built, said Triple Five was dealt an unfair hand. Bermudez noted that construction of Dolphin Mall, a retail center owned by Simon Property Group in Doral, was not subjected to a similar ban when it was built in 2001. The Florida Turnpike has on and off ramps that were built to funnel traffic to Dolphin Mall.\nShortly after taking office, he met with Don Ghermezian and agreed that Triple Five\u2019s project was singled out, Bermudez said. He is sponsoring a resolution removing the American Dream road-funding prohibition that is now scheduled to be heard in September.\n\u201cI wanted a level playing field to get roads built in my district,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cI agreed with [Don Ghermezian] that it shouldn\u2019t have happened. I told the Simon people too. It\u2019s a competition issue between them.\u201d\n\nL\negal fights\nAs Triple Five\u2019s plans stalled due to the road construction funding debacle, the clock was running out for the company. The developer is facing deadlines to get American Dream Miami moving, including finalizing the purchase of the 64 remaining acres from the\nGraham Companies.\nIn 2020, Triple Five and Graham completed a land swap for a separate 40 acres.\nIn July, county commissioners gave Triple Five a lifeline, agreeing to settle an April lawsuit the county filed seeking to cancel Miami-Dade\u2019s development agreement with the Ghermezians\u2019 firm because they had missed deadlines to submit a site plan and obtain the first round of building permits. Triple Five agreed to pay a $5 million penalty in four installments beginning next year to extend the deadlines and give the Ghermezians until 2045 to complete American Dream Miami.\nGiven the Ghermezians\u2019 overall investment in the project, it\u2019s a small price to pay to keep it on life support.\n\u201cIn the context of a large development, the $5 million penalty may not be a huge thing,\u201d said Shlomo Chopp with Case Equity Partners. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the case if [the Ghermezians] were flailing, didn\u2019t have a plan and everything was falling around them.\u201d\nStill, a legal battle with much higher stakes also hasn\u2019t been resolved. Last year, Triple Five sued the Graham Companies to keep alive a purchase agreement for the 64 acres. Graham claims the window to close the deal has expired, and refuses to recognize Triple Five\u2019s contention that the agreement was extended due to a force majeure clause in the contract.\n\u201cGovernmental delays have stalled the project, but clearly [Triple Five] has made substantial progress.\u201d\nTriple Five spokesperson\nTriple Five claims it was delayed as a result of the pandemic. Graham wants to jack up the purchase price, according to the complaint. Florida courts tend to narrowly construe force majeure clauses, meaning the triggering event must be specifically identified in the contract or fall under a catch-all provision and be both outside the parties\u2019 control and unforeseeable. That means if the word \u201cpandemic\u201d is not in the sale and purchase agreement, Triple Five may not win that argument.\nIn its response to the lawsuit, Graham alleges Triple Five has only itself to blame for the delays, and is using the pandemic and the bureaucratic delays over the road construction as an excuse. Attorneys for Graham did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we will reach an amicable resolution with Graham,\u201d Triple Five\u2019s spokesperson wrote.\nN\nothing concrete\nTriple Five has \u201cspent years of intense effort\u201d to just get to the point of lifting the ban on road construction funding, the company said.\n\u201cGovernmental delays have stalled the project, but clearly [Triple Five] has made substantial progress,\u201d the statement said. \u201c[Triple Five] has prepared the full administrative site plan for American Dream Miami and discussed it with county officials.\u201d\nYet, in his January interview with\nTRD\n, Paul Ghermezian\nadmitted\nAmerican Dream Miami is \u201ca number of years away\u201d and there\u2019s \u201cnothing really concrete today.\u201d\nThe project will also likely undergo some changes.\n\u201cI think they have an aspiration to build something there,\u201d commissioner Bermudez said. \u201cFrom some discussions with [Triple Five], it will be more entertainment oriented than retail oriented just because of the market conditions. But I have not seen a plan that says X, Y and Z. We are not at that stage anyway.\u201d\nNevertheless, the Ghermezian theme park mall model appears to be working. Mall of America in Minnesota, the Ghermezians\u2019 largest asset that had been mired in difficulties, is \u201ckilling it,\u201d said Chopp of Case Equity.\nYet, American Dream in New Jersey is still dealing with financial issues, such as a recent drop in value by $800 million, but has experienced success attracting patrons.\n\u201cThe Ghermezians are strong guys. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only ones that are really interested in developing this type of concept would be them and Disney. And Disney already has Orlando.\u201d\n\u2014\nE\nlizabeth Cryan contributed to this story.",

        "content": "It all started with lunch.\nDeveloper Ian Bruce Eichner took his daughter, Alexandra, to the Little Beet in New York for veggie-forward bowls.\nBefore accepting the invitation and picking the spot, she said, \u201cDad, no disrespect, but what\u2019s the agenda? There\u2019s no casual lunch with you,\u201d her father, who goes by Bruce, recounted.\nAbout halfway through the meal, he made the ask. Would she consider working with him for a six-month trial period? It was 2019. She was running a fitness consulting business, which she started after a position overseeing content and brand development for the health firm BeachBody.\nShe agreed to it, starting as assistant project manager at the family\u2019s Continuum Company in early 2020. Her mother, Leslie Eichner, is chief creative officer.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about succession because how would I know if she would like it, how would she fare, what would she be good at?\u201d Bruce said.\nAs it turned out, Alexandra liked it and fared well. She moved to South Florida from New York and became the on-the-ground deputy for all of the company\u2019s condo projects, which include the two-phase La Baia on the Bay Harbor Islands, a Continuum-branded development in North Bay Village and a luxury condo project planned in North Miami.\nNow president of Continuum Florida, she is about to complete the first development she\u2019s been involved in since its inception \u2014 La Baia South Residences, expected to be delivered this fall.\n\u201c[Bruce] has never had a me.\u201d\nAlexandra Eichner on why Continuum has been productive since she joined\nWhereas some major real estate players seem to believe they\u2019re immortal, ignoring succession planning, Eichner, 79, is taking seriously the idea of training his daughter, 37, to run his 1,000-unit, $3 billion condo portfolio. But he\u2019s still Bruce \u2014 obsessive, passionate. There\u2019s no set date, and he plans to keep working in the long term.\nLike some developers of his generation, Bruce is self-made. He\ngot into real estate\nwithout any capital or industry ties, while working as a prosecutor for the Brooklyn state attorney in 1973. He and his first wife, Helen, bought a rooming house, which he borrowed against to renovate the building. She got the property in the divorce, but he kept building.\nDespite\nroots in the Big Apple\n, it\u2019s not a coincidence that Alexandra is training up in the firm\u2019s most active market, South Florida.\n\u201cI think it is very difficult for a 30-year-old entrepreneurial spirit to do in New York between 2022 and 2050 what I, Bruce Eichner, was able to do from 1975 to 2000,\u201d he\nsaid\nin an interview with The Real Deal\u2019s publisher, Amir Korangy, in 2024. \u201cEasier to do it in a place like Florida, in a place that\u2019s growing and where it\u2019s more of a business-friendly environment.\u201d\n(The firm is still active in New York.)\nL\nike father, like daughter\nAlexandra shares a number of character traits with her dad. They\u2019re both to-the-point and want to be five steps ahead of you. Both have sharp senses of humor.\u00a0 Both are detail-oriented. Alexandra, meticulous, wants to understand the inner workings of projects, she said. She focuses on placement of every amenity or fixture, and on the user experience of each building function: how long elevators take to go up and down and where residents will plug in the hair dryer.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pay $1,500 a square foot, I don\u2019t want you to have weird edges of corners that you can\u2019t use,\u201d she said.\nBruce is \u201calways madly chasing the next piece of dirt,\u201d Alexandra said, while she\u2019s consumed with zoning. It\u2019s her superpower, she said. She jokes that she\u2019s reduced her land-use attorneys\u2019 billable hours, but the skill gives her an edge compared to her competitors.\nAfter five years, she can also now look at a site and visualize the building that will go there, which she couldn\u2019t do when she started.\n\u201cKnowing as much as the lawyers do and understanding what the lawyers don\u2019t know \u2014 that is the essence of a real estate developer,\u201d Bruce said.\nAttorney Rachel Streitfeld, mayor of North Bay Village, describes Alexandra as \u201cenergetic, relentless and savvy.\u201d\nAlexandra works out every day, including \u201cheavy weight lifting,\u201d she said \u2014 her personal record is deadlifting 205 pounds. The more stress she\u2019s managing, the more you\u2019ll spot her at the gym. \u201cNo pilates,\u201d she emphasized. She can do seven pull-ups from a strict, straight-arm hang and has climbed to the South Pole.\nShe has also cultivated her risk muscle.\nWhen the Waldorf Astoria Beach Club in Boca Raton, now called the Boca Raton Resort, was closing, Alexandra had the chance to buy the furniture, worth $20,000 per room, for $1,200 a room. She figured it could decorate the former Best Western hotel at a site Continuum had just purchased in North Bay Village, now called the Palm Tree Club.\nThe only problem? Continuum wouldn\u2019t be closing on the property for several months, but the furniture purchase had to happen now \u2014 or never.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the quality and color palette of the furniture I knew we wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity like this, so I took a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I spent the next three months joking with my husband that we might have 120 keys worth of furniture sitting in storage if we didn\u2019t close on the property.\u201d\nT\nhe Eichners\ni\nn North Bay Village\nNorth Bay Village is a small three-island city that sits inside Biscayne Bay, between the mainland and Miami Beach. A 2020 zoning code overhaul allowed for bigger projects, and\ndevelopers came.\nThe Eichners bought the first 1.4-acre part of its site, at 1755 79th Street Causeway, in 2023 for $35 million. They picked up the second part, the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill with an adjacent Best Western, for $75 million last year. (Jesta Group had planned to redevelop the latter property but sold it to Continuum.)\nThe pipeline is robust in the village, but Continuum is the first big project to move forward with building permits, Streitfeld said.\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time, energy and money overhauling our zoning code,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worked our butts off. The approvals mean nothing for the municipality until someone pulls a permit.\u201d\nContinuum\u2019s work will give others proof of concept, she added: \u201cA lot is riding on them.\u201d\nThe first phase, called Continuum Club &amp; Residences, is under construction and at least 50 percent presold.ma\nOther projects include one from Sunbeam Properties, led by Andy Ansin of the billionaire Ansin family, which assembled about 13 acres, and in 2022 secured approvals for a massive, phased development. Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons also plans a Pagani-branded, 30-story, 70-unit condo project in North Bay Village. Shoma Group, led by Masoud Shojaee and his wife, Stephanie, is working on Shoma Bay, a condo tower, but has been delayed; construction could start later this year, based on a recently amended development agreement. Related Group and Macklowe Properties also\nplan\nto develop hundreds of condos on Harbor Island in North Bay Village.\nIn 2023, Alexandra helped write the village\u2019s workforce housing law, which passed in 2023. The law, among other things, requires that developers set aside a percentage of units in new rental projects as workforce housing, incentivizing them with additional height or density.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just so ready to dig into the weeds and the details and look at the code, question the code, work with our planners and make sure she understands the regulatory framework,\u201d Streitfeld said. \u201cEven in the cases where we weren\u2019t so thrilled about something, she presented her position so effectively that we were won over.\u201d\nIn June, the North Bay Village Commission unanimously\napproved\na special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the entire Continuum Waterfront District, which encompasses both sites and is planned to have two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall.\nThe idea to bring in Palm Tree, the hospitality company run by DJ Kygo and his manager Myles Shear, to the current hotel and restaurant in the interim before development started, was Alexandra\u2019s idea.\nThe restaurant and bar now feels like an influencer\u2019s dream (and some residents\u2019 nightmares due to the loud music). It has brought a hipper crowd to North Bay Village.\nF\nuture lunch invitations?\nIn 2022, Alexandra secured a \u201cgnarly approval\u201d at the Bay Harbor development after a new building official determined that the already entitled La Baia South project had an issue with FEMA compliance.\n\u201cI found this funky mechanism that allowed us to reduce our parking count to be compliant with other things, which required approval. That was the first time I realized I was very into reading code,\u201d she said. It was a make-or-break moment for the project, and when she solved it, she got a promotion to president of Continuum Florida.\nNow, La Baia South, a waterfront building designed by architect Luis Revuelta, is expected to be delivered within three months. It\u2019s still unknown whether this project will replicate or exceed the Eichners\u2019 success at the two-tower Continuum South Beach, completed in the early 2000s, where condos have appreciated in value over the years, holding some of the stronger per-square-foot pricing in Miami Beach.\n\u201cYou either hand her the baton for the project or you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the challenge for the dad, when I have to step back or not.\u201d\nIan Bruce Eichner on succession\nAlexandra plans to live at the new building, which has 68 units and eight stories, with her husband, Ozzie Pagan, who leads global finance for the commodities bank Macquarie, and their two mini Goldendoodles, Brooklyn and Blueberry.\nAlexandra, Bruce said, still has more to learn, including the execution of an acquisition and fully understanding the intricacies of construction.\n\u201cWhat is intellectually challenging, you either hand her the baton for the project or you don\u2019t,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge for the dad, when I have to step back or not.\u201d\nStill, you get the sense from them that they are partners. Bruce is not a swashbuckling, cowboy developer who demands his adult children do what he says \u2014 or else. And Alexandra\u2019s happy to be challenged.\n\u201cI want my brain to be working very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not up at two in the morning thinking about a problem, I\u2019m probably bored.\u201d\nEven if succession wasn\u2019t front of mind for Bruce or Alexandra at that lunch in New York, a plan is clearly in motion. Bruce told\nTRD\nthat Alexandra\u2019s sister, Lindsay, a former real estate agent, could also eventually work for the family business.\nIn the meantime, the family firm is looking north to markets like Fort Lauderdale and Singer Island, Alexandra said, which are less saturated than the Miami Beaches and Brickells of the region. They\u2019re busy, with two gung-ho developers at the helm.\n\u201c[Bruce] has never had a me,\u201d Alexandra said. \u201cAnd we are both pretty productive.\u201d",

        "content": "Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners bagged 10 open-air shopping centers for $395 million, with the portfolio heavily weighted toward the Sunshine State and specifically South Florida,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nBoston-based private equity firm Bain and New York-based retail investment firm 11North bought nine plazas in Florida, five of which are in Broward and Palm Beach counties, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. One property is in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\u201cThe NOI [net operating income] is definitely majority in South Florida. It\u2019s over 50 or 55-plus percent in South Florida,\u201d said Martha Kelley of Bain.\nEntities tied to Newark, New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate, the real estate arm of Prudential Financial\u2019s global investment manager PGIM, sold the South Florida shopping centers, according to records.\nJLL will take over management of the properties from Coral Gables-based commercial real estate firm Southeast Centers.\nThis was an all-cash deal, and the buyers plan to secure a loan in the future, Kelley said.\nThe\nBroward\nproperties include: the 217,000-square-foot Sawgrass Square at 12500 West Sunrise Boulevard in\nSunrise\n; the 154,000-square-foot Plantation Promenade at 10065 Cleary Boulevard in Plantation; and the 84,000-square-foot Miramar Commons at 11000 Pembroke Road in\nMiramar\n, according to records.\nIn\nPalm Beach County\n, Bain and 11North purchased the 29,000-square-foot Lake Worth Plaza at 4360 State Road 7 in an unincorporated area of the county near Wellington; and the 143,000-square-foot Garden Shops at Boca at 7060 West Palmetto Park Road in an unincorporated area of the county near\nBoca Raton\n.\nElsewhere in Florida, the portfolio consists of three plazas in Kissimmee. They are the\u00a0 160,000-square-foot Rolling Oaks Commons; the 86,000-square-foot Promenade at Poinciana; and the 38,500-square-foot Solivita Marketplace. In Tampa, Bain and 11North bought the 94,000-square-foot New Tampa Center.\nThe South Carolina plaza is the 75,000-square-foot Point Hope Commons in Charleston.\nThe portfolio has an occupancy of more than 93 percent, the release says.\n\nA Publix store anchors Sawgrass Square, Plantation Promenade, Miramar Commons, Garden Shops at Boca, Promenade at Poinciana, New Tampa Center and Point Hope Commons. Other tenants at the properties include Chick-fil-A, McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Bank of America and Chipotle.\n\u201cWe speak with tenants on a daily basis. Florida is one of the highest markets where they want to expand to,\u201d said Brian Harper, CEO of 11North.\nBain Capital, founded in 1984, has roughly $185 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It invests across business lines, including real estate, tech, life sciences, crypto, credit, and private and public equity. Ryan Cotton leads\nBain\u2019s real estate division\n.\nBain Capital Real Estate purchased the portfolio through one of its funds and will eventually syndicate a portion of the portfolio to a global limited partner, said Kelley, declining to name the partner.\n11North was founded last year by Harper, following Kimco Realty\u2019s acquisition of RPT Realty, where he was CEO. 11North staff members are formerly of RPT. Bain Capital has an ownership stake in 11North.\nLast year, Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North formed a joint venture to invest in retail, especially open-air shopping plazas. The Florida and South Carolina portfolio marks the joint venture\u2019s second purchase. In June, it paid about $212 million for three shopping centers in Oklahoma City, according to a release announcing the deal at the time.\nSouth Florida\u2019s retail market showed signs of\nsoftening\nin the second quarter, as vacancy rates creeped up, and the average asking rent slightly decreased, according to a Colliers report. Broward\u2019s vacancy hit 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent during the second quarter of last year, while Palm Beach County\u2019s hit 4.4 percent, up from 3.6 percent. Palm Beach County\u2019s average asking rent dropped to $28.85 per square foot from $29.51 a square foot, year-over-year. Broward still experienced an increase of the average asking rent to $28.52 a square foot, from $27.78 a square foot, year-over-year, according to the report.\nGrocery-anchored\nshopping centers have proven to be resilient, and investment sales of these properties continue. Last month, Boston-based Longpoint paid\n$34 million\nfor the Presidente Supermarket-anchored Miramar Parkway at 3176 South University Drive in Miramar.\nIn June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group sold the Whole Foods-anchored Marketplace at the Outlets shopping center at 1821 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach for\n$133.2 million\n.\nPublix also has been purchasing its standalone supermarkets and shopping centers anchored by its stores. Over the past year, the Lakeland-based grocer has paid about $273 million for these properties, including\n$25 million\nin March for its store and a Starbucks outparcel at 2501-2519 East Sunrise Boulevard at the Galleria Mall in Fort Lauderdale.\n",

        "content": "Some condo developers are reporting good news.\nRicardo Dunin is among them. He says his sales team secured contracts for 77 condo sales at his two condo-hotel projects in Brickell, Domus Brickell Park and Domus Brickell Center, within the last 70 days or so. (The average price of the units is $584,000.)\nHe explains why.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ahead of schedule. We pay the brokers 100 percent on time. People love that we have a professional management company that will take care of the buildings. And the price point for a luxury product with good taste is very attractive,\u201d he says.\nThis is not the norm.\n\u201cWhat I hear is everyone else is struggling,\u201d says Dunin, CEO of Oak Capital and co-founder of North Development.\nAbout three years ago, the short-term rental condo project model boomed in South Florida. Investors liked the price point and the promised rental income, or the suggestion that they would earn their money back, and then some. Then the market got a bit oversaturated.\nDunin, who was among the developers of the first big wave of condo-hotels built in the \u201890s, seems to have found a sweet spot. He plans to launch a third Domus-style project by early next year, and is under contract to purchase the site for a fourth development. Domus Brickell Park is 67 percent presold, and Domus Brickell Center is about 30 percent presold, he says.\nThirty-seven percent of his buyers are domestic, which means the overwhelming majority are international, and most of those are Latin American buyers, he said. These are investors looking to purchase small units they can rent out on a short-term basis.\nThe foreign buyer hasn\u2019t disappeared, though some have retreated.\nA new report released by the Miami Association of Realtors and a handful of top brokerages \u2014 Cervera Real Estate, ISG World, PMG, Serhant and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 states that about about half of the presold units in Miami\u2019s new construction pipeline are being purchased by foreign buyers. Sixty percent of the 9,115 condos are presold or in contract.\nThe problem we have tracking new development sales is that no public record can corroborate the information developers and brokers put out there, until these buildings are completed and the deeds recorded. So for the years that these projects are in the presales/construction process, the sales teams are the gatekeepers of this information.\nAnd unfortunately, the information that made it into the report is pretty limited. It doesn\u2019t break down sales figures by project, nor does it disclose when these contracts were signed.\nIt\u2019s meant to help flip the doom and gloom outlook that\u2019s playing out in some areas, projects and segments of the market. The aging condo market, made up of buildings that are 30 years and older, is struggling in part because of increased regulations (a reaction to the deadly Surfside condo collapse in 2021).\nAlicia Cervera Lamadrid, managing partner of her family\u2019s brokerage firm, Cervera Real Estate, says the perception that interest from foreign buyers is waning stemmed from The New York Times\u2019 June 5 article titled:\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought this is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve read in a long time,\u201d she tells me.\nThe Times\u2019 story referred to the Miami Association of Realtors\u2019 report that found home sales to foreign buyers fell to 10 percent of all transactions in the tri-county region from August 2023 to July 2024. This was the lowest share since 2015. That report was a survey of nearly 2,400 real estate agents in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties. New developments likely weren\u2019t included.\nThis prompted Cervera and other brokerage heads to take action. \u201cThere were no optics into preconstruction,\u201d Cervera adds.\nAlfredo Pujol, chairman-elect of the Miami Realtors, says the idea for the latest report came from \u201call the [articles] we hear that are negative\u201d \u2014 not just the Times. He was surprised by the high share of sales represented by foreign buyers, but not that foreign buyers are still in the market.\n\nTheir report tracked new development sales for the 18-month period ending in June.\n\u201cWe have huge demand from Latin America. Colombia has been strong, Guatemala, Honduras. We\u2019re seeing great demand from Brazil as well,\u201d Cervera says. \u201cPeople are looking at these as second homes/investment properties. I personally think many of these units may turn into full-term residences.\u201d\nCervera\u2019s leading sales and marketing for Dunin\u2019s projects.\nCompass agent Mike Martirena, of the Ivan &amp; Mike Team, and his partner, Ivan Chorney, have been traveling all summer to meet clients abroad.\n\u201cMy foreign buyers tend to like the condo-hotel component. They look at it like a safe haven.\u201d Martirena says.\nHave President Trump\u2019s immigration policies and mass deportations affected his international clients\u2019 mindsets? No, he says.\n\u201cThey want to make sure their money is safe,\u201d he says, \u201cwhether they agree with the politics or not.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI did hear that construction has slowed way down at one big Brickell condo development, and at a smaller project nearby, the developer has been returning buyers\u2019 deposits. Do you know of any others that are floundering? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Alexandre De Macedo, an executive in the restaurant industry, and his wife Clarissa De Macedo sold their over 9,600-square-foot single-family home at 4725 Davis Avenue in Miami to a trust for $23 million.\nCommercial:\nClarion Partners sold the apartment complex known as 33 West at 6300 Southwest 24th Place in Davie for $97.5 million. Crow Partners purchased the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe new waterfront estate at 2914 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach hit the market for\n$27.9 million\n. The 8,540-square-foot mansion, with seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a saltwater pool, spa, rooftop decks and an outdoor kitchen is listed with William Raveis Real Estate agent Steve Simpson. The nearly half-acre property has 80 feet of direct water frontage and a dock. Property records show a company owned by John Galiher, founder of Preferred Freezer Services, paid $3.5 million for the property in 2021.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nActivate Hospitality paid $10 million for the former Palihouse hotel in Miami Beach\u2019s Faena District. Halstatt Real Estate Partners sold the 71-key property at 3101 Indian Creek Drive, now known as the Hotel Trouvail. Activate\u2019s Sagar Desai tells me the company plans to complete a $1 million refresh of the hotel and will bring in a local food and beverage operator for the ground floor. It will remain open.\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management\u2019s heavily redacted hurricane evacuation plan for the Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention center drew criticism from lawmakers and advocates who are demanding more transparency,\nCBS Miami\nreports. The plan omits key details like alternate relocation sites and vendor procedures.\nFlorida\u2019s Third District Court of Appeal ruled that Miami\u2019s decision to postpone its 2025 election without voter approval was unconstitutional, reaffirming the lower court\u2019s decision in the case and siding with mayoral candidate Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nSt. Petersburg officials and the Tampa Bay Rays discussed a potential $40 million settlement to end the team\u2019s lease at Tropicana Field instead of repairing the hurricane-damaged stadium. Repair costs are nearing $60 million, according to the\nTampa Bay Times\n. The Rays\u2019 agreement with the city has them playing at Tropicana Field through the 2028 season, which was later extended one year after Hurricane Milton tore through the dome.",

        "content": "A company linked to the family office of Canadian billionaire Lino Saputo paid $16.5 million for a waterfront teardown on Miami Beach\u2019s\nAllison Island\n.\nIt also appears that the same buyer owns the property next door, adding to the family office\u2019s holdings.\nProperty records show Lester Lipschutz sold the 8,911-square-foot, eight-bedroom and eight-and-a-half-bathroom house at 6640 Allison Road to Quadriam USA. The buyer\u2019s LLC is managed by Danial Zeppetelli, president and COO of Montreal-based Quadriam Investments, the family office of Amelia and Lino Saputo.\nSaputo and his family\u2019s net worth is about $4.5 billion, according to Forbes. His late father, Giuseppe Saputo, founded the family\u2019s eponymous Montreal-based business, a major producer of cheese and other dairy products. The Saputos also have a stake in Major League Soccer\u2019s Montreal Impact.\nThe house at 6640 Allison was marketed as a vacant lot. The house was built in 1992 on a nearly half-acre lot. It previously sold for\n$17.6 million in 2023,\nwhich means it sold for a loss.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Devin Kay represented the seller. Julian Johnston of the Corcoran Group brought the buyer, according to the listing. They declined to comment.\n\nThe mansion next door at 6650 Allison Road is owned by a company with a Canadian mailing address for Quadriam. Amelia Saputo has been linked to the property.\nThe eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom and three half-bathroom home, built in 2018, spans 10,020 square feet. It sits on a 0.6-acre lot. The Canadian entity paid $15.2 million for the property in 2020.\nThe two properties total just over an acre of waterfront land. A number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals\nhave been buying properties\nnext door or across the street from their waterfront homes, driven by the desire for more privacy, family planning and to increase their property values.\nEarlier this year, Karlton Companies sold the waterfront spec mansion at 6494 Allison Road for\n$31.5 million\n, marking a record for the Miami Beach island. The 8,024-square-foot house was completed last year.\nAnd in June, the elaborate waterfront home of French national Aur\u00e9lie Bard, who has been accused of embezzling more than 100 million euros,\nsold out of receivership\nfor $18.5 million. A company managed by attorney Charles Ratner bought the 6,924-square-foot, five-bedroom and six-bathroom house at 6580 Allison Road.\n",

Zach Young, a developer and CEO of Young Capital Ventures, manages ground-up development, design and construction for Nora. The developers so far have been working on developing a hotel and adaptive reuse of a row of aging warehouses into retail, restaurants and offices.\nThe 11-story condo building with 19,700 square feet of ground-floor commercial space is proposed for the 5.2-acre site at 1105 North Dixie Highway, according to city records.\nThe apartment building, which also will be 11 stories, will consist of 291 market-rate rentals, 52 units at workforce rents and seven for-rent townhouses, according to the developers\u2019 spokesperson. The project, slated to rise between 10th and 11th streets, also will have 18,300 square feet of ground-floor retail and 65,000 square feet of amenities. Denver-based multifamily property manager Sentral will manage the building.\nFor Nora\u2019s first phase, Miami-based Place Projects, West Palm-based NDT and Greenwich, Connecticut-based Wheelock are working to retrofit the warehouses along Railroad Avenue into 150,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and 55,000 square feet of offices. The first phase is expected to be completed this year.\n\nThe three developers, in partnership with BD Hotels and Sean MacPherson, also are developing the 201-key Nora Hotel.

        "content": "German asset manager DWS Group and its U.S. real estate subsidiary Rreef are on an office selling spree, especially in South Florida.\nIn February, Frankfurt-based DWS sold the Las Olas Centre I &amp; II office towers at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$208 million\n. The next day, a Rreef Property Trust affiliate sold the Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard, also in\ndowntown Fort Lauderdale\n, for\n$221 million\n, according to records.\nThe deals mark the biggest office investment sales in South Florida so far this year. (If Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s planned\n$275 million\npurchase of the Sabadell Financial Center in Miami\u2019s Brickell closes, it will surpass DWS and Rreef\u2019s sales.)\nIn Coral Gables, DWS has The Alhambra two-building office complex on the market for about\n$125 million\n, a source told\nThe Real Deal\nlast month.\nYet, DWS and Rreef aren\u2019t reaping a windfall from their sales. Las Olas Center I &amp; II traded for $4 million more than DWS\u2019 purchase price in 2014, and Bank of America Plaza sold for $1 million than Rreef Property Trust\u2019s purchase price in 2016, according to records. At the $125 million asking price, The Alhambra would trade for $6.4 million than DWS\u2019 purchase price in 2015, records show.\nElsewhere in the U.S., DWS\u2019 24-story office building at 505 Montgomery Street in San Francisco hit the market in April with an asking price of about\n$95 million\n. DWS had paid $118.5 million for the tower in 2015.\nIn an interview, Todd Henderson, DWS\u2019 head of real estate for the Americas, declined to talk about specific assets \u2013\u2013 but shed light on Rreef\u2019s overall strategy, including why it\u2019s stepping back from offices and where it\u2019s redirecting capital.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nQ. What is the relationship between Deutsche Bank, DWS Group and Rreef? There seems to be a lot of confusion out there?\nA. The brand is Rreef. It was started in 1975 in San Francisco. The business was acquired in 2002 by Deutsche Bank and continued to be operated under the Rreef brand while at Deutsche Bank.\u201d [Deutsche Bank bought Rreef in 2002 for $490 million. The Rreef name is an abbreviation for Rosenberg Real Estate Equity Funds, with Rosenberg a reference to Rreef\u2019s founder Claude Rosenberg.]\n[Rreef] extended across the global real estate business when Deutsche Bank bought it.\nIn 2018, Deutsche Bank spun out all of their asset management business under the brand of DWS, which included the Rreef business. We still operate under the DWS umbrella, with its largest shareholder remaining Deutsche Bank. And we still operate under that 50-year old brand of Rreef. All of our funds are named with the Rreef [brand]. Rreef Property Trust is a fund, Rreef America II is a fund. They\u2019re all different funds and different ownership entities that have different groups of investors in them. Some are commingled, some are not. \u2026 Some focus on equity, some focus on debt, some focus on core real estate, some focus on development. So it\u2019s a big, big business, and oftentimes people get lost when they just focus on one of the funds. I\u2019m the chairman of the board of Rreef Property Trust, which is a fund, and it\u2019s only a small piece of our overall AUM.\nQ. So is Rreef a subsidiary of DWS Group?\nA. Yes. We have offices in New York, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boston, Orange County, Seattle. We believe capital is global and real estate is local and you need the local knowledge to execute appropriately.\nQ. Speaking of local, let\u2019s talk about Rreef\u2019s divestment this year of South Florida offices. What is the strategy?\nA. I never talk about individual assets. If I did, I\u2019d spend all my time talking about individual assets because the firm owns here in the Americas 500 or so assets. I\u2019ll talk about macro strategy. \u2026 In terms of office as a sector, we\u2019ve de-weighted the office sector in our portfolios, and that has driven a number of selling decisions. Those selling decisions are the result of us thinking that we can redeploy capital for better risk adjusted returns in other sectors.\nQ. So you are not just divesting from offices in South Florida but across the U.S.?\nA.Yes.\nQ. What are the other sectors in which Rreef is redeploying capital?\nA. Residential. We\u2019re very bullish on the residential sector. If you look at what\u2019s occurring in terms of supply, new starts are down to 15-year lows, which is going to translate into a shortage of apartments or living units in the next, probably 12 months. Demand is unprecedented. We have never seen absorption of multifamily units like we\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters, and last year was only beaten by 2021. You couple that with the lack of affordability for single-family homes, driven by a lack of supply, and then the cost of financing being expensive, and us not believing that there\u2019s really any relief in sight for that cost of financing, translates into a pretty significant opportunity in rental housing. When you look further into the affordability of rental housing at the highest quality apartment levels, it\u2019s very affordable, given the incomes and the rents. So we really like that sector. We feel there\u2019s significant opportunities for income growth. We like Florida as a market for that. We like South Florida. \u2026 Florida has been the big beneficiary of in-migration in a number of the gateway markets, and so Florida is a target market for us.\nQ. Are you referring to for-sale residential or rentals?\nA. Multifamily rental housing, single-family rentals. We build single-family projects. \u2026 We have an inhouse development team. As a general rule, we take on development partners for development activities, but that\u2019s the only area that we typically take on partners.\n\nQ. You brought up affordability earlier. In South Florida, and generally the rest of the state, homebuying remains out of reach. Is that why you are focusing on apartments?\nA. Homebuying is not affordable. There are certain parts of home renting that are not terribly affordable.\nQ. So are you also developing or investing in affordable or workforce rents, including through Florida\u2019s Live Local Act?\nA. We are buying and creating homes that are market-rate rental homes. \u2026 We like owning newer properties with lower CapEx, and we like targeting a renter pool that can afford what we\u2019re buying or building. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the segment of the market we\u2019re in.\nQ. When did Rreef start divesting offices and redeploying into rentals?\nA. In 2018 or so. We were redeploying into industrial significantly, and as we came through the pandemic, we were redeploying into industrial and residential, and we continue to be active buyers of [both]. But given that our portfolios are well allocated to industrial, we have been more aggressively deploying into residential over the last 18 or so months.\nQ. Most institutional investors started stepping back from U.S. offices once Covid started in 2020 due to remote work and higher vacancies. Why did you start stepping back from the asset class two years before Covid\u2019s onset?\nA. Office was becoming increasingly expensive from a capital commitment perspective. The amount of capital per unit of NOI is significantly higher than all the other sectors. And what we were seeing was that that was increasing both through inflation and leasing concessions. We felt like what we wanted to own in office was new product that had the lowest amount of capital commitment, in the highest job and population growth markets. So we began repositioning our portfolio in that regard. The pandemic was the great accelerator. We were seeing real shifts in population growth, changes in the supply chain and the transformation of retail all before the pandemic happened. The pandemic really accelerated all of these trends.\nQ. What makes office capital intensive? Tenant improvements? Concessions?\nA. A lot of office is leased on a gross basis instead of a net basis. So increasing taxes becomes a landlord\u2019s cost, and that\u2019s disruptive to income growth. There are a lot of reasons to de-weight office.\nQ. Aside from multifamily, you also started redeploying capital to industrial. Why, how is that market doing now and how focused are you on it now?\nA. We began investing in industrial long before the pandemic hit, primarily because [of e-commerce growth] and consumers\u2019 expectation to have their online purchases delivered in a very short timeframe. It caused a need for change in the supply chain, [which] was built for three-day delivery. Everybody expects one-day delivery and even same day delivery today. You have to get goods closer to the consumer. We recognized that very early on and started shifting our capital deployment to industrial, both buying it and building it in locations that were proximate to large population bases. That accelerated during Covid. \u2026 What have we seen in the industrial sector more recently? A normalization of demand, and in some markets, we\u2019ve even seen rather tepid demand. But new [industrial construction] starts are down. We do expect\u00a0 demand will bounce back over the next couple of quarters, and given the \u2026 lack of new supply, that bodes well for the industrial sector through this next cycle.\nQ. Why did industrial leasing demand temper more recently?\nA. There was a lot of demand that was brought forward during Covid. There was a fair amount of leasing that occurred ahead of the demand, so the utilization rate of space is catching up. We just had to work through that as demand normalizes.\nQ. What about industrial demand and supply in South Florida?\nA. Given the land constraints in South Florida, there\u2019s a large population base that generates a lot of demand. There is import demand as well. The flower industry in South Florida continues to be a big driver.\nQ. Are the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, especially on steel, aluminum and lumber, affecting development costs for Rreef\u2019s rentals?\nA. Costs are increasing. \u2026 That is further thwarting new starts, which is only going to exacerbate \u2026 the dearth of supply that we expect in \u201826, \u201827, \u201828. The combination of tariffs on materials [and] the immigration policies have an impact on overall costs. Labor can be up to 50 percent of [costs for] any construction project. It\u2019s going to ultimately translate into higher development costs than what we experienced prior to the tariffs and prior to the immigration policies of this current administration. A lot of developers are in a bit of a wait-and-see mode as to how costs are going to shake out.\nQ. How is Rreef dealing with the higher costs of building apartments and single-family home rentals?\nA. We\u2019re doing our best to lock in costs before development. At the moment, there are opportunities to buy real estate below replacement costs, and if you can buy high-quality, newer, well-designed real estate and at below replacement costs, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to be building. This is why you\u2019ve seen such a drop off in overall new starts frankly across the real estate space, but [especially] in the two favored sectors of residential and industrial.\nQ. Can you quantify Rreef\u2019s U.S. real estate portfolio?\nA. The portfolio in the U.S. is over $35 billion. That\u2019s the amount of real estate we own currently. We developed somewhere in the order of roughly a little over $3.5 billion through the last cycle of residential and industrial.\n",

        "content": "Fannie Mae filed a foreclosure complaint against the owner of a North Miami apartment building.\nOn July 25,\nFannie Mae\n, led by CEO Priscilla Almodovar, sued Salem House Holding and its manager, Alexander Padilla, for alleging defaulting on a $3.9 million mortgage that includes accrued interest and attorney fees, court records show.\nThe loan is secured by Salem House, a two-story building with 32 apartments at 13155 Northeast Sixth Avenue. The lawsuit also names as a defendant the city of North Miami, which has a lien on the property since 2023 due to alleged unresolved code violations, records show.\nPadilla and Fannie Mae\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe garden-style building was completed in 1964. Salem House Holding bought the property for $3.3 million in 2019, records show. A year later, the entity nabbed a $4 million from Fannie Mae, with Padilla signing as a personal guarantor, the complaint states.\n\nFannie Mae alleges Salem House Holding failed to make monthly mortgage payments since March. The apartment building owner allegedly owes $3.7 million in principal, plus an additional $200,000 in interest and fees.\nFannie Mae\n, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and other government agencies are in the midst of a major nationwide investigation into mortgage fraud involving loans to multifamily borrowers. The fraud could run into the billions of dollars, according to a recent investigation by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFannie Mae alone claimed to have $700 million of exposure tied to eight blacklisted sponsors, including investors that controlled roughly 1,235 apartment units in Chicago.\nSome borrowers are facing criminal charges or have already been convicted. Last month,\nBoruch Drillman\nwas sentenced to five years of probation for his role in a $165 million mortgage fraud scheme involving two apartment complexes.\nLast year,\nAron Puretz\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Prosecutors alleged Puretz engaged in a multi-year scam to fraudulently obtain $54.7 million in loans from Freddie Mac and private lenders. In December, he was sentenced to five years in prison.",

        "content": "A Spanish developer scored final approval for a 4,032-unit Live Local Act project in West Little River.\nThe complex marks the biggest South Florida development under the state\u2019s affordable and workforce housing law, as well as one of the biggest planned projects in the tri-county region overall.\nPablo Castro plans\nThe HueHub\nwith seven 35-story apartment towers on the nearly 12-acre site at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Laura Tauber, a longtime South Florida developer and investor who co-founded Bay Harbor Islands-based commercial real estate firm Taubco with her husband, Irwin Tauber, is partnering on the project as a co-developer and consultant, according to Castro.\nCastro and Tauber, who first filed their project application last summer, scored final site plan approval last month. Originally, they proposed 3,233 apartments in six towers, expanded to 3,971 units and finally settled on 4,032, according to records.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, HueHub will consist entirely of fully furnished apartments, all for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income. That exceeds the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement that at least 40 percent of units are for tenants earning up to 120 percent of the AMI.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s current annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though that\u2019s expected to increase by the time HueHub is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2028.\nA third of the units will be studios with monthly rents starting at about $1,300; a third will be one-bedroom apartments with rents starting at $1,600; and the remaining third will be two-bedrooms with rents starting at $1,900, according to Castro and the news release.\nThe 200,000 square feet of amenities will include retail and dining space, community library and gardens, a learning center aiding children with homework and adults with continuing education, and a show kitchen teaching and encouraging healthy meal preparation, according to Castro and the release. The complex will have a 2-acre park.\nHueHub also will have on-site employees who can provide various services to tenants, including apartment cleaning, dog walking and child care.\nThe aim is to create a comfortable lifestyle at attainable rents through both the project\u2019s design and amenities, Castro said. Renderings show at least one pool, mural-covered exterior walls, lushly landscaped outdoor gathering spaces, and plants in both the library and show kitchen.\nIn that, HueHub departs from traditional designs and barebone amenities at workforce-priced and affordably priced apartment complexes. Because they will be collecting lower rents, developers of below-market rate rentals generally keep project costs down by steering clear of designs and amenities common in luxury apartment buildings.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do these white buildings with small windows and make people live in a simple way,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWe can improve the quality of life if we can provide them with solutions to issues they have in their day to day. [Their] issues are simple: kids, time, traffic, expenses. So we set up amenities not like a little gym and pool. It\u2019s a huge co-working area, large retail space.\u201d\nSo how will Castro and Tauber build and financially sustain the massive HueHub, including its many amenities and on-site staff, while still collecting below-market rents?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to do the project on a bigger scale. The kind of amenities and services, all this philosophy, you can\u2019t implement it in 500 units,\u201d Castro said. \u201cYou need scale.\u201d\nHe plans to use more efficient and economical modular construction methods. This includes tunnel form construction and pre-fabricated interiors, he said.\nIn tunnel form construction, pre-fabricated, tunnel-shaped steel molds cast a building\u2019s walls and slabs simultaneously. Pre-fabricated interiors are generally for interior walls, as well as kitchens and bathrooms.\nAlso, the\nLive Local Act\ngives developers some financial breaks. Under the law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, developers can build larger projects than a site\u2019s zoning allows. Another Live Local benefit is that it grants a full property tax exemption for developers like Castro who plan to have all units at below-market rents.\nConstruction of HueHub is expected to start by year-end, according to the release. Castro is in talks with two potential construction lenders, both of which are banks, he said.\nCastro, 53, is little known in South Florida real estate but has a long history in Spain.\nIn a\nprofile of Castro and Tauber\nlast summer,\nThe Real Deal\nfound out Castro is the same person as Pau Castro S\u00e1ez, who at one point earned a reputation as Spain\u2019s biggest developer. (The Pau spelling of his name is in Catalan, spoken in his native Barcelona, and Pablo is in Spanish.)\nCastro started out in real estate flipping apartments in Barcelona in the 1990s. In 2007, he and business partner Pedro Molina Porras started Grupo Corp, growing it into one of the largest landowners in Barcelona and partnering with Spain\u2019s Grifols family to develop thousands of apartments. The Grifols are owners of a pharmaceutical conglomerate. Castro has also been involved in his father\u2019s nightclub business.\nTaubco, the firm Tauber founded, has a more established record in South Florida. It developed the 54,000-square-foot Keystone Plaza, the 120,000-square-foot Biscayne Commons plaza and nearby Arena Shops in North Miami Beach in the early 2000s, records show. In 2009, Taubco completed the four-story Causeway Square office and retail building in North Miami that includes offices, an LA Fitness and other retailers. Taubco\u2019s other investments include paying $14.3 million in 2006 for Biscayne Harbor Shops in Aventura, and selling condo development sites in Bay Harbor Islands to Bruce Ian Eichner in 2021 for a combined\n$29.5 million\n.\nDevelopers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith a flurry of proposals, many promising to bring thousands of units on a single site or towers in traditionally low-rise neighborhoods.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group has filed several Live Local applications. This includes supersizing the existing 1,379-unit Haley Sofge public housing complex in Little Havana with an additional\n1,038 units\ndeveloped under Live Local. The site is at 800 Northwest 13th Avenue, 780 Northwest 13th Court and 1389 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami.\nIn Miami\u2019s Wynwood, New York-based Bazbaz Development seized on Live Local to propose towers that bypass the neighborhood\u2019s restriction of 12-story heights. The firm wants to build a\n48-story, 544-unit\ntower at 2110-2134 North Miami Avenue and 2101-2135 Northwest Miami Court. In the nearby Wynwood Norte district, where heights are capped at eight floors, Bazbaz proposes a\n37-story, 364-unit\ntower at 70 Northwest 36th Street.\nAnd in Goulds, a neighborhood in south Miami-Dade, largely home to single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings, Argentine developer RCC Developers wants to build a 300-unit Live Local project in a\n25-story tower\non the northeast corner of Southwest 214th Street and U.S. 1/South Dixie Highway. Goulds is in an unincorporated area of the county.\n",

The seller was an entity linked to Claire and Anthony Florence, the\nWall Street Journal\nfirst reported.\nNadler told the publication he\u2019d given up his rental in Miami and was living at the Surf Club Four Seasons hotel when a friend pointed out the option of buying a condo.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the overhead of dealing with houses and all of the stuff that comes with houses,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIf I could wake up at 4 a.m. and just order room service \u2014 this is so perfect.\u201d\nXimena Penuela with Fort Realty represented both the buyer and the seller.\n\nNadler is the founder of OpenEvidence, an AI platform for doctors to stay up to date on medical research. Earlier this month, OpenEvidence closed a $210 million funding round that brought the company\u2019s valuation to $3.5 billion. Nadler founded the company in 2022 and has a 60 percent stake in the firm. He also previously founded and sold Kensho, a financial intelligence service, for $550 million in 2018.

Alex Sapir said the asking price is closer to $50 million.\nAn affiliate of Israel-based Sapir Corp., which owns roughly 40 percent of the partnership; CNMB International, a Chinese construction company; and Hong Kong-based G-Resources, hired Berkadia to market the property. The assemblage at 210 Northeast 18th Street and 1768 Northeast Second Court\nhit the market\nin 2019 with CBRE. It\u2019s near the Arts &amp; Entertainment District.\nThe land is in an Opportunity Zone, according to the offering memorandum. Berkadia\u2019s Omar Morales and Jaret Turkell have the listing, and a call for offers is expected in late September, Morales said.\nThe property is zoned T6-36B-O, which allows for 741 residential units and nearly 1.5 million square feet of development, with the potential for more with public benefit bonuses. A prospective buyer could also tap into the tax advantages of the federal Opportunity Zones program.\nMignonette Downtown, an oyster bar and seafood restaurant, is a tenant of the existing property, generating about $120,000 a year in rent. Its lease ends in May 2026, but could be canceled with 90 days\u2019 notice, according to the offering memo. That portion of the property is designated historic, which would require that plans are approved by the city\u2019s Historic &amp; Environmental Preservation Board.\n\nMorales said the property\u2019s location in the southern part of Edgewater is more walkable, with nearby access to a Publix across the street, Margaret Pace Park and the Adrienne Arsht Metromover station.\nThe site could be developed into either condos, apartments or a combination of both. Morales pointed to rents of $6 per square foot secured at Forma, a recently completed Crescent Heights development on Biscayne Boulevard. That\u2019s higher than $5.50-per-square-foot rents that condos are securing, and about $4.25 per square foot at apartment buildings in the area.\nSapir Corp. bought the site as ASRR Capital, when\nAlex Sapi\nr, his then-partner and ex-brother-in-law Rotem Rosen and their\nChinese and Hong Kong partners\npaid $33 million for the eight-parcel assemblage in 2017.\nPlans for the site included two towers, one rising 60 stories and a second rising 40 stories, with up to 1,200 apartments, plus retail and office components.\nA Rosen-led partnership plans to develop an assemblage\njust north of the property\ninto a mixed-use high-rise project.\n",

The buyer paid $283 a square foot for the center.\nThe 11.2-acre property sold for $13.2 million above the previous sale price three years ago. An affiliate of New York-based Morgan Stanley Real Estate, the seller, paid\n$25.5 million\nfor it in 2022, records show.\nThe building was completed in 2020 by an affiliate of Atlanta-based IDI Logistics, which sold it to Morgan Stanley.\n\nTenants include stone manufacturer Marble of the World, public works equipment provider Wastequip WRX and Wastebuilt Environmental Solutions, a company that distributes parts for trash dump trucks and other solid waste equipment. But Pompano Business Center II has roughly 79,000 square feet available for lease, an online listing shows.\nFounded in 1986, Cabot has invested over $17 billion in industrial real estate and operated over 1,750 buildings totaling more than 243 million square feet, the firm\u2019s website states. In December, Cabot picked up another industrial property in Pompano Beach. The company paid\n$91.3 million\nfor Silver Beach Industrial Park, a four-warehouse complex.\nPompano Beach is within the Northeast Broward submarket, where the vacancy rate hit 7.2 percent in the second quarter, slightly above the 6.6 percent vacancy rate for overall Broward County, according to a recent Colliers\u2019 report. During the same three-month period, the average asking rent for a warehouse in Northeast Broward was $16.47 a square foot, compared to $17.01 a square foot for the overall county.\nLast year, Cabot sold a 15.8-acre distribution facility in Weston to Atlanta-based Chik-Fil-A for\n$50.5 million\n. In 2019, Cabot paid $30 million for the site.\nIn Miramar, Cabot owns the Bridge Point Miramar distribution center. The firm paid\n$71.2 million\nfor the property in 2021.",

        "content": "Two Roads Development and Alpha Blue Ventures have begun closings for their newly completed Fort\u00e9 on Flagler condo project in West Palm Beach.\nRecords show the project at 1309 South Flagler Drive received its condo declaration earlier this summer, and closings began July 14. Flagler Residential LLC, an affiliate of Two Roads and Alpha Blue, has so far sold 12 units in the 25-story, 40-unit condo project. A total of 37 units were pre-sold, for a combined $289.1 million in sales volume, a spokesperson confirmed.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica with interiors by Jean-Louis Deniot, the tower has two units per floor that each span three or four bedrooms and 4,200 square feet. Amenities include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities,\nguest suites\n,\nprivate dining room\n, golf simulator, library and business center, its website shows.\nSales that have recorded so far total $74.6 million in volume. Here\u2019s a look at some of the buyers:\nFox News contributor Liz Peek dropped $5.8 million on unit 902, records show.\nMichael and Suzanne Ainslie bought unit 1102 for $6.1 million, according to records. Michael Ainslie was president and CEO of Sotheby\u2019s Holdings from 1984 to 1994 and director at Lehman Brothers from 1996 until its 2008 bankruptcy, according to published reports. Suzanne Ainslie is an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nStephen E. Myers Sr., the owner of Myers Auto Group, bought unit 1401 for $5.9 million, records show. Myers Auto Group operates McLaren, Aston Martin, Jaguar and Land Rover dealerships in West Palm Beach.\nFort\u00e9 10 South and Fort\u00e9 10 North, two Florida LLCs linked to hedge funder Ara Cohen, dropped a combined $10.6 million on units 1001 and 1002, according to property records. Cohen is co-founder of New York-based Knighthead Capital Management. Last year he was linked to the\n$51.6 million\npurchase of a lakefront home in Palm Beach.\nThe remaining units for sale include the 9,000-square-foot penthouse, which is asking $47.5 million. Christian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing. John Reynolds with Douglas Elliman and Gary Pohrer with Serhant have the listings for two other units for sale, 2202 and 2302, which are asking $14.7 million and $15.3 million, respectively.\nTwo Roads is based in West Palm Beach and led by co-managing partners Reid Boren and Taylor Collins. Earlier this week, a partner in a Four Seasons Bahamas project\nsued the firm for $35 million\n, alleging breach of contract. Two Roads denies any wrongdoing.\n\nTwo Roads partnered with Marius Fortelni and Scott Maslin\u2019s Alpha Blue to secure approvals for the West Palm project in 2019, but were met with pushback from locals. A West Palm Beach activist group sued unsuccessfully to block the project that year, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported. The partners launched sales in 2020, just days before Covid shutdowns took effect. They scored\na $121.5 million construction loan\nfrom Bank OZK for the project in 2021.\nWest Palm Beach has changed dramatically since then, Boren said.\n\u201cCertainly this is not the same community that we started construction in,\u201d he said, noting the city\u2019s pro-development swing. \u201cThe fact that I fought a lawsuit for over a year with an activist group that managed to hold us up, there\u2019s no such thing now.\u201d\nThe market growth means Boren and his partners achieved a much higher sellout volume than previously expected. Condos\u2019 price per square foot started at over $1,000, and ended in the high $2,000s, he said.\nThe boom has also meant an influx of competition that wasn\u2019t there pre-pandemic, he said. Developers have\nmore than 6,000 units in the pipeline\nin West Palm Beach. That changes the calculus for more projects going forward, Boren said.\n\u201cWe would look very carefully at each new project and make sure there\u2019s a need for it,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "A group of landowners want to expand Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary by 64.8 acres for a mixed-use project with over 1,000 residential units.\nThe Urban Development Boundary, or\nUDB\n, aims to restrict suburban sprawl east onto Biscayne National Park and west onto the Everglades, as well as onto farmland, wetlands and other open land that could be needed for the preservation of the national parks. Historically, developers\u2019 proposals for projects outside the UDB have been contentious, drawing opposition from environmentalists, and requiring a super-majority approval from county commissioners.\nHerkoz filed an application for an up to 1,200-unit residential development with single-family homes and apartments, and up to 90,000 square feet of retail on the northwest corner of Southwest 137th Avenue and Southwest 248th Street, according to county filings. It would include some below market units, with 20 percent of the residents designated for households earning up to 140 percent of the area median income.\nThe site, which is adjacent to the UDB, consists of four lots at 13701, 13805 and 13885 Southwest 248th Street, as well as a fourth parcel without an address, in an unincorporated area of south Miami-Dade. The property is within a half-mile from the busway and near the\nPrinceton\nneighborhood.\nHerkoz, which owns one of the lots, is led by Francisco, Jacinto and Ignacio Kozhaya Simon, each holding a 25 percent stake in the entity, as well as Ivette and Adela Kozhaya Simon, each holding 12.5 percent, according to the filing. Alflo Sunset, which owns the other three lots, is led by Alain and Florence Riguidel, each one having a 50 percent stake.\nIn the application, Herkoz and its attorneys cite an urgent need for housing construction in Miami-Dade, as well as the lack of developable land in the county.\n\nMiami-Dade, which for decades has been a magnet for new residents, experienced a boom in the pandemic years due to an influx of Northeasterners and West Coasters. At the same time, the county is sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades.\nAbout 5,600 new single-family homes are needed annually through 2030, and slightly less through 2040, Miguel Diaz de la Portilla and Javier Vazquez, Herkoz\u2019s attorneys, wrote in the application, citing Miami-Dade\u2019s estimates. The county has identified about 20,000 lots where single-family homes and townhouses can be built, though the attorneys argue not all of these can be developed due to site-specific restrictions.\n\u201cAt current rates, developable land for single-family homes is projected to be fully depleted by just 2027,\u201d de la Portilla and Vazquez wrote. \u201cSolving this housing crisis will require more than building wherever space remains \u2014 it demands a strategic focus on making land available near major transit corridors.\u201d\nHerkoz is asking the county for a Departmental Impact Committee review and a change of the site\u2019s Comprehensive Development Master Plan designation from \u201cagricultural\u201d to \u201cspecial district.\u201d\nThe South Florida Business Journal\nfirst reported\non Herkoz\u2019s proposal, which was originally filed in May.\nIn one of the most recent UDB expansion proposals, Coral Gables-based Coral Rock and Miami-based Aligned Real Estate wanted to develop the 5.9 million-square-foot South Dade Logistics and Technology District on more than 300 acres on the southeast corner of the Florida Turnpike and Southwest 122nd Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade. After a\nhard-fought battle\nto win approval by county commissioners, Coral Rock and Aligned\u2019s project was dealt a blow last year. A judge\nruled\nthat the county missed a deadline to approve the district.\nMiami-Dade commissioners considered South Dade Logistics and Technology District five times before\napproving it\n, with the developers often making\nconcessions\n, including halving the project size.\n",

He failed to find a buyer and took out a $25 million bridge loan from Axos in 2023, according to property records filed in Los Angeles County. But that didn\u2019t buy enough time.\nSasson was still looking for a buyer willing to pay what he thought the home was worth when the bridge loan came due in March. He found himself facing foreclosure for far less than the home\u2019s $88 million listing price, and put up a fight in court.\nHe claimed it was a wrongful foreclosure in court proceedings and even filed for bankruptcy to avoid the approaching auction date, but to no avail.\n\nNow, within days of the auction date, a private lender has come to the rescue.\nDalan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe new financing from Private Money Solutions will buy Sasson another 12 months to sell the home.\nThe loan comes with a six-month interest reserve, Blatin said. After that, Sasson\u2019s debt will grow quickly. It has an annual interest rate of 11 percent, but Blatin is confident the property will sell before the loan\u2019s term is up.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll lower the price and sell it, and we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Blatin said. \u201cI hope not to foreclose on anyone.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll still make a tidy sum for Private Money\u2019s investors. Blatin declined to share who is backing the Arkell Drive rescue fund, but described the investors as \u201cfriends and family that like to do this and make a nice return.\u201d\nRead More",

Of those, 5,471 properties, or 97.1 percent, have had their rights-of-entry returned, allowing rebuilding efforts to get moving.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019\nCol. Sonny Avichal, who has overseen debris cleanup efforts\n, gave his final briefing on Monday as work winds down at several major sites. In this next phase, 12 cleanup crews remain at work, though demobilization is underway and is expected to last two more weeks.\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have worked in tandem on the debris program. Once properties are cleared, homeowners will be able to start rebuilding with the help of insurance, state disaster grants and federal aid.\n\nSouthern California Edison, which allegedly sparked the fire in Altadena with a faulty powerline, is offering residents money through a wildfire compensation fund. The company is currently facing multiple lawsuits from survivors and local governments, including the City of Pasadena, over damages and recovery costs.\nThe Southern California chapter of the National Organization of Minority Architects is among those entities ready to step in to help with\nreconstruction design\nefforts, according to\nLAist\n. The group of architects has created approximately 200 free individualized plans to help people rebuild after losing their homes as part of its \u201cRebuild Readiness\u201d effort.\nMeanwhile, rebuilding in the Pacific Palisades just got a bit more restrictive after\nMayor Karen Bass\nissued an executive order Thursday barring multiple dwellings being built on wildfire-affected properties in the neighborhood, per\nL.A. Business First\n. The move, bolstered by a similar state order from Gov. Gavin Newsom, stops any redevelopment that would\u2019ve been enabled by Senate Bill 9, which permits property owners to split their lots into two and build up to four housing units on what was previously one single-family-zoned lot.\nAs it stands, Los Angeles County has issued 149 rebuilding permits in the affected areas, including 133 in the Eaton fire burn zone and 16 in the Pacific Palisades, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Three summers ago, 50 acres of bare land was returned to the City of Pasadena. Rarely can you stumble upon an empty plot of that magnitude in such a desirable spot in Southern California. But the land is still undeveloped and without a master plan.\nThe parcel once belonged to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but after a failed, decades-long battle to extend a freeway, the government-entity relinquished the property\u2019s control to the city. No one expected the \u201cstub,\u201d as the land is called, to be totally developed by now but people hoped for at least a master plan.\nThe area, meant to be an extension of the 710 that would ultimately connect Long Beach to Pasadena, was cleared in the 1970s, displacing thousands of people and destroying homes that were owned or rented by mostly low-income and minority residents,\naccording to\ncity officials. Once the land was returned, the city chose to consider its development potential through a \u201crestorative justice framework.\u201d\nWhatever the framework, a lack of political will among elected officials appears to be stalling progress.\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind where we should be, without a question,\u201d city council member Steve Madison said.\nGeoffrey Baum, a former president of the West Pasadena Residents Association who has served as an elected trustee of Pasadena City College, said there appears to be \u201czero urgency,\u201d and called it \u201ca shame\u201d that there has been little to no progress, leaving a \u201cmassive scar\u201d in the heart of the city.\nPasadena-based real estate attorney Richard McDonald sees it as a case of politicians being prudent to a fault, getting nowhere because they\u2019re unwilling to risk upsetting anyone.\nThe city council appointed an advisory group to assist in the planning efforts that have almost solely focused on social justice, Madison said.\nBut as Baum understands it, people weren\u2019t forcibly removed from their homes\u2013-they were compensated. To clear the area for the failed 710 freeway extension, the properties were obtained using a\nhardship acquisition\nprocess. That isn\u2019t to say people had much of a choice. But it wasn\u2019t a Chavez Ravine situation, Baum said, a reference to the predominantly low-income Mexican-American communities that were violently\nevicted\nin the late 1950s to build Dodgers Stadium through eminent domain.\n\nEfforts to correct past, perceived injustices will only continue to delay the project, Baum said.\nThe ad hoc committee hasn\u2019t done much better it seems. The four-member body has met less than a handful of times and lacks a leader and action, according to Madison, who along with two other council members and the mayor are on it.\n\u201cThe bottleneck is the city council, and in particular, the mayor,\u201d Madison said.\nMayor Victor Gordo, who holds a citywide elected position, did not respond to a request. Still, it\u2019s on the council to lay out a clear vision. For Madison that could mean a transportation element, housing and a sacred place: a plaza or park of sorts.\nConsultants have been brought on, and a $2.8 million\ncontract\nhas gone to architecture firm Perkins Eastman, which did not respond to a request for comment. Madison called some of the firm\u2019s proposed plans provocative and thoughtful and others \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d One, he said, included a water feature, which he described as a moat between West Pasadena and the rest of the city.\nAnother consultant, David Grannis, who worked on the return of the land and was later hired by the city, said things could have gone a little faster, and that \u201cthe city council has to kind of get their arms around how they want to play this game,\u201d which he believes it is now doing. He said a land-use concept plan is coming toward the end of the year \u2014 a campus plan of some sort is what he said Perkins is considering. The city council will have some decisions to make, then the legal process, likely securing entitlements and an environmental review, begins. And developers are interested, Grannis said.\nMcDonald, however, doesn\u2019t think a request for proposal (RFP) has gone out. None of his clients have made a move, he said. Developers want an element of certainty, they want to know what they can build, McDonald said, but the city itself doesn\u2019t even know.\nWhen asked about an RFP, assistant city manager Brenda Harvey Williams only said the city has engaged consultants to advise on the master plan process, develop the master plan and document the history of the stub.\nAs for whether developers have approached the city, she said, \u201cnot yet as it is not the time for that,\u201d in an emailed statement.\nAt the moment, the city isn\u2019t hemorrhaging money sitting on the land, but it is losing out on revenues, job creation, transportation formation, housing and retail development.\n",

        "content": "Entrepreneur Dara Mir will now be able to enjoy a Hailey Bieber smoothie in the former\nhome of Erewhon\u2019s owners\n.\nErewhon CEO Anthony Antoci and president Josephine Antoci have sold their Bel Air mansion for $28.5 million to Mir, husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lily Ghalichi,\nRobb Report\nreported.\nThe home at\n755 Sarbonne Road\nsold for more than $6 million above what the Antocis paid for it a year ago. Shortly after purchasing the property, the couple put it up for rent, with the most recent price being $200,000 per month, according to Robb Report. Mir secured the property for $4.5 million less than the final asking price \u2014 a nearly $9 million discount from the original asking price of nearly $37 million.\nThe property was acquired by an entity tied to Nigerian businessman Kola Aluko in 2012 for $24.5 million. At some point after that,\nThomas Flohr\n, founder of private jet company VistaJet, bought the Sarbonne Road property in an apparent off-market deal. The Department of Justice, in pursuit of Aluko, attempted to seize the property after it had been transferred to Flohr, leading the Swiss businessman to pay $16 million to avoid losing it. He then listed the manse at $63 million, which dropped to $22.5 million by the time the Antocis bought it in May 2024.\n\nSpanning 15,000 square feet on a 1-acre lot, the property features six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and a bevy of amenities for its new owner. The main entrance has a curved staircase with a wooden door framed by limestone blocks. The palatial home has 16-foot ceilings and travertine floors with an elevator between the three floors.\nA formal living room includes a wet bar and fireplace while the formal dining room has a sweeping view of the city. The home\u2019s great room opens out to the pool and includes a casual lounge, a dining nook and a family kitchen. It also has a secondary chef\u2019s kitchen.\nNew owner Bir can find peace and quiet in a wood-paneled study or enjoy a movie in a screening room with another wet bar. The owner can also work up a sweat at the fitness center and cool off in a spa next to the infinity-edge lap pool. The terrace overlooks the city and is shaded by olive trees.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s all in the family at Jamison, a developer based in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown that has become the name to know for office-to-residential conversions.\nJaime Lee\nis the public face of\nthe $6 billion real estate company\n, which her parents co-founded in 1994. Her father, David Lee, also an internist, is now chairman. Her mother, dentist Miki Nam, oversees the firm\u2019s accounting department. They named the company for Jaime, the oldest of their four kids, and she was promoted to CEO in 2020.\nHer oldest brother, Phillip, runs the office\u2019s property management department, while the baby of the family, Garrett, runs multifamily development. Jaime\u2019s husband, Matt Cheesebro, runs an affiliated multifamily general contracting company. The middle brother, Brian, is in multifamily property management. Phill\u2019s wife, Stephanie, is a lawyer at Jamison.\nThe Lee clan is a family of high achievers.\nJaime, Phill and Garrett received their JDs from the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. Middle brother Brian, who\nran a gallery/bar\nin Koreatown and served as an art consultant for Jamison before recently joining the family business, has a master\u2019s degree in business.\nThe siblings, who span in age from 36 to 40, are all \u201creally close,\u201d Jaime said.\nJamison has a portfolio spanning 18 million square feet, including 33 multifamily buildings with 6,600 units in the city of Los Angeles, as well as office, retail and medical properties throughout Southern California. Assets include the 1.8-million-square-foot Equitable Plaza and the World Trade Center office complex. Jamison also has 2,000 residential units under construction.\nThe Real Deal\ntalked to Jaime in a conference room at the company\u2019s 428-unit Opus rental building in Koreatown, about the family business, racism and parenting.\nWhen\nTRD\nfollowed up with some questions about the company\u2019s early reputation as a \u201cslumlord,\u201d and some of the firm\u2019s properties being sent to special servicing recently, Lee went mum. But on topics of longevity, raising her kids as a second-generation immigrant and her career trajectory, she shared responses.\nThe interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: November 14, 1984\nHometown\n: San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles\nLives\n: Mid-City area of Los Angeles\nFamily\n: Husband; children ages 9, 7 and 5; and puppy Kona\n\u201cThere are so many people who always are like, \u2018Oh, successful people wake up before everybody.\u2019 That\u2019s bullshit. No. Night Owl. All my best work: like 10 p.m. to midnight.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve completed seven office-to-residential conversions.\nWe\u2019re under construction on three right now, and we probably have 10 more in the pipeline that we\u2019d like to do.\nHow does that impact the office market?\nWe\u2019ve just been notoriously oversupplied in office in the City of Los Angeles, and severely undersupplied in housing. So I think this is a rebalancing of what the needs are for our city. Ground-up construction just isn\u2019t penciling because of a myriad of factors, but the conversion still works really well.\nHow did your parents get into real estate?\nMy parents emigrated from South Korea when they were in their teens. They met in grad school at UCLA. My mom became a dentist. And my dad was an internist. Back then, being a doctor was a pretty stable and good job, and you could make money and have some savings. So they would invest in all these side businesses. And they started investing in real estate. This was after the riots [following the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department officers in the Rodney King beating case] in 1992 and then the earthquake in 1994.\nProperty\nvalues in this area were just decimated.\nHow does it work with you being the boss at work?\nMy parents are still around, so we\u2019re still in our first-generational shift. And I think it\u2019s really fascinating as you talk to other family businesses because everyone goes through it their own way. But you\u2019re not rewriting a story that has never been told. So for instance, I spoke at a family business class at USC years ago, but when [the professor] first approached me, I was like, \u201cWhy would anyone want to hear me talk about my family business?\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh, because family businesses are all very similar.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not, like we have all these idiosyncrasies, like we have all of these things that make our story unique and different.\u201d And he referenced the family business textbook. And I flipped through the textbook, [thinking,] \u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re all the same!\u201d\nWas it always assumed you\u2019d become the CEO?\nI think so. I think in Korean culture, though, it\u2019s like the eldest son gets a lot of favor too.\nWas there something you would have been doing otherwise?\nNot careerwise, but I did apply to MFA programs in writing in New York during my senior year. I was an English major in undergrad at University of Southern California and would have loved to live and write in New York for a couple years before law school and joining the business.\nHow did you end up ahead of your siblings at Jamison?\nI am the oldest and I\u2019ve been in the business for the longest period of time. I think I have a skill set and a personality that make me attuned to a leadership role. I\u2019ve served on over 30 corporate and civic and nonprofit boards \u2014 many times I rise to chair or president. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg thing with being an eldest daughter. If you just grow up and you are naturally responsible for younger people, then maybe you learn to talk to different personalities in different ways, and to intrinsically lead.\nHow would your siblings describe you in a few adjectives?\nThey\u2019d probably say bossy, maybe hyperbolic. My first brother would definitely be [sarcastic], like, \u201cOh, Jaime never exaggerates!\u201d I think I\u2019ve matured a lot since we were kids. When I was younger, they would be like, \u201cOh, Jaime always has to be right.\u201d\nSo they wouldn\u2019t say that now?\nThey probably still would, but that\u2019s from knowing me for 40 years. In my own self-reflection I would say no. With kids you really have to be like, \u201cMommy made a mistake,\u201d because you have to model for children that you cannot be perfect. And so I try to approach my work with that too, that we\u2019re all just iterating. You don\u2019t have to know exactly what you\u2019re doing all the time. You can\u2019t make the exact perfect decision 100 percent of the time, and you also have to be willing to say, like, \u201cwhoops.\u201d\nPerfectionism is such a disease. There\u2019s no such thing as being perfect. There are a lot of people who are much older than I am and are very, very successful, whether it\u2019s in our industry or other places where I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, they just have it all figured out.\u201d I talk to them and they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just like making it up half the time,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re the CEO of this public, huge company!\u201d And they\u2019re just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up here.\u201d\n\nDoes parenting help you at work?\nYes. For instance, sometimes you\u2019ll be in a meeting with a horrendous bully or somebody who\u2019s very, very difficult, and I might say, \u201cYou seem upset. Are you okay? Are you feeling okay?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d And you put some snacks out, and they\u2019re, like, starving. And they\u2019re coming from this place of just not being in homeostasis in their body. And they\u2019ll eat the protein bar and drink some water. And I\u2019m like, \u201cCan we take a break for 10 minutes?\u201d And I\u2019ll come back and they\u2019re fine. And those are the types of things I\u2019ll do with my kids. I didn\u2019t know those kinds of things before. I would just escalate.\nWhat\u2019s it like raising your kids as a second-generation immigrant versus how you were raised by first-generation immigrants?\nMy parents worked, and still work, extremely hard just to get solid footing under them in a new country. First-gen parents will always say that their kids are lazy and not tough enough to do what they did, and that\u2019s probably true.\nOur hard work is different in nature from their hard work, and I imagine it will be different still with my kids. I was definitely a latchkey kid in the Valley in the 1990s. We roamed the neighborhood, could only spend what we earned, and had very little supervision. What we learned out of necessity, I try to teach my kids as an education. They know the value of a dollar and how to earn it, but I\u2019m trying really hard to avoid the immigrant scarcity mindset that was so ingrained in me.\nYour parents, siblings and you have advanced degrees!\nI think if you are an immigrant, education is the great equalizer, and my family still believes that. What we saw though [the weekend of June 14 and 15], with the protests [part of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d day of action against the Trump administration], and what we inherently feel being Asian American is this concept of [being a] perpetual foreigner and this idea of diaspora \u2014 like, we don\u2019t belong in Korea, but a lot of times we feel like we don\u2019t belong here either.\nDo you feel like that now?\nOne hundred percent. When people see me at first glance, a lot of times people don\u2019t assume that [I\u2019m] American. And even walking around in front of our properties in Downtown L.A. people have yelled, \u201cKonnichiwa, go home.\u201d\nKonnichiwa is Japanese. And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not Japanese.\u201d But I also try not to engage because it\u2019s very scary.\nWhen you enter a room with real estate folks, do you feel discrimination as a woman and being of Korean descent?\nMost misogyny and overt harassment have declined a lot. We still don\u2019t have nearly as many female leaders in the industry as anyone expected to see or wanted to see.\nYou met President Biden. What was that like? Did he seem in any way not with it?\nNo, he was great. You see lots and lots of photos and videos of people who are president and they look just like a normal person. And when you actually meet someone who has served at that level, it\u2019s something else, like his eye contact, his presence. We were frozen in a moment in time. He was very charismatic. He asked me a couple great questions about climate and sustainability at the port within the shipping industry. He was the real deal.\n\u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re all the same!\u201d\non the epiphany that all family businesses are basically alike\nLet\u2019s do a quick lightning round. Tommy\u2019s or In-N-Out?\nIn-N-Out, of course.\nPoke or tacos?\nTacos.\nUber or Waymo?\nI\u2019ve never ridden in a Waymo, so I think it\u2019s like Uber by default. But I\u2019m obsessed with longevity and the longevity sciences so I\u2019ve been drinking way, way, way less. And I know that the only reason to Uber is not just because you\u2019re drinking, but I usually just drive myself.\nHow did you get into longevity?\nI sadly had a friend who passed away a few years ago, just after her 40th birthday. We both had young kids then, and I became obsessed with health, prevention, screenings and optimizing healthspan. Most of the people I know are engaged with these pursuits at varying levels. Many people put too much emphasis on supplements or experimental treatments. I focus on the three main buckets: sleep \u2014 the most important \u2014 exercise and food. Each of these has an enormous body of research, habits and protocols that go along with them.\nBack to the lightning round: Which private club \u2014 California Club or Jonathan Club?\nJonathan Club. They usually say Cal Club is for the people who own LA, and Jonathan Club is for the people who run L.A. The Jonathan Club is much more modern, diverse. I love it. I want to go somewhere that\u2019s an extension of my home, and the Jonathan Club is definitely that.\nAre you a member?\nYes.\nLakers or Clippers?\nLakers, that\u2019s an easy one.\nThe Getty or Los Angeles County Museum of Art?\nLACMA.\nMorning lark or night owl?\nDefinitely night owl. There are so many people who always are like, \u201cOh, successful people wake up before everybody.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit. No. Night owl. All my best work: like 10 p.m. to midnight.",

The megamansion has gone on and off the market since, and was last listed for $137.5 million, giving Schmidt a 20 percent discount.\nThe French chateau-style property holds 14 beds and 27 baths. The Manor, as it is called, spans more than 56,000 square feet on 4.7 acres. It has a beauty salon, bowling alley and a screening room.\nTishman cashing in\nTishman Speyer is\nselling\nan office building in Beverly Hills for more than $200 million \u2014 the last in a portfolio of three adjacent commercial properties.\nThe buyer of the three-story, nearly 300,000-square-foot office building at 345 North Maple Drive called Maple Plaza wasn\u2019t immediately clear. The reportedly half-empty, Class A property is home to production teams for \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer\u201d and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d and has goop Kitchen and Cafe Ruisseau as retail tenants. Tishman Speyer purchased Maple Plaza in 2005 for $101 million.\nThe New York City-based real estate company purchased the two other two adjacent office properties then, too, at 9242 Beverly Boulevard and 407 North Maple Drive, and sold them both last year. Fashion Nova founder Richard Saghian bought the latter for $118 million in an off-market deal and made it the brand\u2019s headquarters. Months later Jason Illoulian and fashion and hospitality entrepreneur Frank Zarabi snagged the former for $90 million.\nTishman Speyer took out a $220 million loan connected to the trio of properties two years after purchasing them. The debt was placed on a special servicing watchlist, but the company secured a $275 million refinancing ahead of its maturity date.\nBeverly Hills offices have a 24.6 percent vacancy rate but are still trading hands. Last quarter, the fifth-priciest office sale in West Los Angeles was Law Brothers\u2019 purchase at 8350 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills for $26 million.\nKilroy sells 65% occupied office building\nKilroy Realty\nsold\na Santa Monica office building to Washington Capital Management for $40 million, the company announced in its latest earnings release. Washington Capital Management claimed the purchase was on behalf of a client.\nKilroy purchased the seven-story, 73,000-square-foot property at 501 Santa Monica Boulevard for more than $16 million in 1998.\nThe Santa Monica office building was only 65 percent occupied, according to the company\u2019s first-quarter financial results. Occupancy had been on the decline since the pandemic, quarterly statements show: consider, the building was 97.8 percent occupied in the first quarter of 2020.\nNonetheless, Kilroy reported an increase in income to $68.4 million for the second quarter of the year from $49.2 million a year earlier. Funds from operations increased, too, to $135.9 million compared to $132.6 million during the same period.\n\u201cWe are pleased to report on a strong quarter of execution across every facet of our business,\u201d Kilroy CEO\nAngela Aman\nsaid in the second-quarter earnings release.\n\u201cWe were active on the capital recycling front, with significant progress recently made on both the monetization of land in our future development pipeline and on dispositions of non-strategic operating properties, as institutional interest in West Coast office assets continues to improve,\u201d Aman said.\n\nApartments, please\nConcord Capital Partners\npaid\ntwo sellers $79 million in separate deals for five residential buildings throughout Los Angeles, all constructed in the 1920s.\nThe deals include three buildings in Koreatown and one building each in Hollywood and Lakewood, totaling more than 500 apartments. Sellers included the Seligman Group for four of the buildings and Midwood Investment &amp; Development for one.\n\u201cLos Angeles is one of the most difficult cities in which to build scale, given the relatively small size of most buildings,\u201d Concord CIO Jonathan Fhima said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve successfully assembled 537 units with significant value-add potential across five of L.A.\u2019s most historically significant properties \u2014 buildings that have housed icons such as Marilyn Monroe, multiple U.S. presidents and other high-profile figures.\u201d\nConcord used a $60.5 million senior loan and $30 million in equity.\n\u201cWe were attracted to these properties because of their favorable pricing relative to historical sales, replacement costs, and what we view as the intrinsic value of the assets,\u201d Concord chief executive Reuben Robin said. \u201cThe properties have seen strong Class A renter demographics across nearly a full century of market cycles.\u201d\nAnother Jamison office-to-residential play\nJamison is\nplanning\nto turn a 20-story office building in Koreatown into 495 apartments. The property at 3550 Wilshire Boulevard will be called the \u201cWalker.\u201d\nPlans include renovating the existing ground floor and adding a rooftop amenity deck with pool and barbecue, and penthouse mezzanines. Ground-floor tenants such as Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf will remain.\nJamison has been busy on Wilshire. In November, the company began a similar adaptive reuse project at 3325 Wilshire Boulevard, across the street from the company\u2019s headquarters. Plus, it is working on a ground-up high-rise complex at 3600 Wilshire; and two years ago, Jamison filed plans to convert a 17-story office tower at 6380 Wilshire into 210 apartments.\nLos Angeles\u2019 housing goals include almost 457,000 new units by the end of the decade and office-to-residential conversions such as Jamison\u2019s can help the effort.\nOC office campus meets buyer\nParkTerra and Jen Partners\nbought\nan office complex called the Axis in Anaheim for $62.5 million.\nThe complex spans more than 300,000 square feet across three properties. It was sold by a joint venture between Pendulum Property Partners and an unnamed global banking giant.\nAxis, located in the Platinum Triangle district and in close proximity to Angel Stadium, the Honda Center and Disneyland, comprises a creative office building made for owner-user tenants; a residential redevelopment site; and another office building.\n\u201cThe Axis portfolio generated strong interest from a broad spectrum of investors, developers and owner-users,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Anthony DeLorenzo, who helped broker the deal, said in a statement. \u201cThis transaction reflects the continued momentum in the Anaheim market, where quality assets like Axis stand out\u2026 The seller ultimately selected a capable cash buyer who performed as promised, reinforcing the strength of the offering and execution.\u201d\nOrange County\u2019s office vacancy rate was unchanged at 19 percent\u00a0 in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.\n",

        "content": "Spelling Manor, one of L.A.\u2019s largest mansions, can lay claim to a tie for the market\u2019s priciest deal of the year after selling for $110 million on Thursday,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe trade, which was recorded in the MLS, puts 594 South Mapleton Drive on par with the May sale of\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air.\nCarolwood Estates CEO Drew Fenton represented the seller, reportedly a\nSaudi national\nwho has yet to be identified publicly. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s\nLinda May\nrepresented the buyers, revealed to be former Google CEO\u00a0Eric Schmidt\u00a0and his wife,\u00a0Wendy, according to\nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nCarolwood did not respond to requests for comment on the deal Thursday evening.\nThe double-ending of Spelling Manor marks another notch in the belt of Beverly Hills-based Carolwood, which was founded in November 2022 by Fenton, Chief Marketing Officer Ed Leyson and Managing Broker Nick Segal.\n\nThe brokerage\u2019s name is all over 2025\u2019s priciest deals in Los Angeles County, which takes in the City of Los Angeles and pricey enclaves such as Bel-Air and Brentwood, as well\u00a0 87 smaller municipalities, a roster that includes high-end fixtures Beverly Hills, Malibu and Santa Monica, among others.\nFenton, along with\nWestside Estate Agency\nco-founder\nKurt Rappaport\n, also represented former Crown Resorts chair James Packer\u2019s $110 million purchase of the Nimes Road property. Carolwood was on the sell side of the Nimes Road deal, with Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, David Parnes and James Harris representing a limited liability company tied to L.A. asset management firm European Investment Management Services Inc.\nThe brokerage was also involved in the $86 million off-market sale of 391 North Carolwood Drive, the previous top sale for this year. That\u2019s in addition to this year\u2019s next priciest trades at\n1028 Ridgedale Drive\nin Beverly Hills for $60 million in April and 942 North Alpine Drive in Beverly Hills for $51.8 million.\nSpelling Manor\nlast traded for nearly $120 million in 2019 and hit the market in 2022 for\n$165 million\n. It\u2019s gone on and off the market since then, and was most recently listed for $137.5 million.\nThe French chateau-style megamansion counts 14 beds and 27 baths that borders the Los Angeles County Club. Often referred to as The Manor, the home totals more than 56,000 square feet on 4.7 acres, according to the listing. Among the highlights are a beauty salon, bowling alley, rose gardens and screening room.\nSpelling built the sprawling estate in 1990. Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone then paid $85 million for it in 2011, shelling out a reported $20 million on various upgrades before placing it back on the market in 2018 for $175 million.\n",

        "content": "Concord Capital Partners is growing its multifamily holdings in Los Angeles.\nThe Beverly Hills-based investment firm paid $79 million to two sellers in separate deals for five historic properties in Hollywood, Koreatown and Westlake,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. In total, the buildings have 537 units and were all constructed in the 1920s.\nIn Hollywood, Concord snapped up The Fontenoy, a 51-unit building at 1811 Whitley Avenue. Farther south in Koreatown, the firm acquired The Langham, a 181-unit building at 715 Normandie Avenue; The Sir Francis Drake, a 61-unit property at 841 Serrano Avenue; and The Piccadilly, a 74-unit property at 682 Irolo Street. To the east in Westlake, Concord grabbed Park Wilshire, a 170-unit building at 2424 Wilshire Boulevard.\nThe Seligman Group sold the Fontenoy, Langham, Sir Francis Drake, and Piccadilly buildings, while Midwood Investment &amp; Development offloaded the Park Wilshire. Concord executed the acquisition using a $60.5 million senior loan from Arbor Realty Trust as well as $30 million in equity.\n\u201cWe were attracted to these properties because of their favorable pricing relative to historical sales, replacement costs, and what we view as the intrinsic value of the assets,\u201d Reuben Robin, Concord\u2019s CEO and founding principal, said in a statement, per CO. \u201cThe properties have seen strong Class A renter demographics across nearly a full century of market cycles.\u201d\n\nThe prices that Concord paid for each property aren\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s likely that it got them at a discount from their previous values, according to CO. Midwood, for example, acquired Park Wilshire in 2019 for $38.2 million \u2014 nearly half of what Concord paid for all five buildings.\n\u201cLos Angeles is one of the most difficult cities in which to build scale, given the relatively small size of most buildings,\u201d Jonathan Fhima, Concord\u2019s chief investment officer and managing principal, said, per CO. \u201cWe\u2019ve successfully assembled 537 units with significant value-add potential across five of L.A.\u2019s most historically significant properties \u2014 buildings that have housed icons such as\nMarilyn Monroe\n, multiple U.S. presidents and other high-profile figures.\u201d\nThe multifamily market in Hollywood has seen some big-ticket activity over the past year. Earlier this month,\nGrubb Properties and PCCP\npaid $98.4 million for the 280-unit Fifty Five Fifty Apartments at 5550 Hollywood Boulevard. In December,\nCityview\npaid $35.5 million for a 112-unit building at 1950 Tamarind Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The source declined to identify the buyer.\nThe Class A property boasts a fitness center with a yoga studio, dining options and electric vehicle charging stations. Tenants include the production teams for \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer\u201d and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d\naccording to\nCoStar, which notes the building was half-empty as of early January. Retailers on site include goop Kitchen and Cafe Ruisseau.\nTishman Speyer\npurchased\n345 North Maple Drive in 2005 for $101 million along with two adjacent office properties. The New York City-based landlord declined to comment on the upcoming sale of Maple Plaza. CBRE\u2019s Stephen Somer and Brooke Silver are brokering the deal and declined to comment.\n\nTishman Speyer sold the other two buildings in the portfolio, at 9242 Beverly Boulevard and 407 North Maple Drive, last year. Fashion Nova founder Richard Saghian\nacquired\nthe latter for $118 million in an off-market deal in August and made it the brand\u2019s headquarters. Months later Jason Illoulian and fashion and hospitality entrepreneur Frank Zarabi nabbed the former for $90 million.\nTishman Speyer took out a $220 million loan connected to the trio of properties two years after purchasing them. The debt was placed on a special servicing watchlist, but Tishman Speyer secured a $275 million refinancing ahead of its maturity date,\nTRD\npreviously\nreported\n.\nBeverly Hills\u2019 office market has a 24.6 percent vacancy rate, according to a second-quarter CBRE\nreport\n, though office buildings are still trading hands. Last quarter, the priciest office sale in West Los Angeles was Barings\u2019 Playa Vista purchase from Clarion Partners for $151 million, the report notes. Beverly Hills notched the fifth-highest spot on the list with Law Brothers purchasing an office building at 8350 Wilshire Boulevard for $26 million.\n",

It\u2019s a major step up in space for the firm, which employs 675 attorneys in 45 offices around the world.\nFisher Phillips opened its first Los Angeles office in 2011 and has offices in DTLA and in the same Woodland Hills building where it will be moving spaces. The downtown office spans 9,500 square feet at 444 South Flower Street while its current\nWoodland Hills\noutpost spans nearly half of its planned 13,624-square-foot footprint.\nThe law firm\u2019s Woodland Hills office is located in the 21-story Warner Center Towers office complex, which houses other law firms, consumer products firms and insurance companies. Fisher Phillips new digs at the property are 89 percent larger than the firm\u2019s previous space.\nWhen Fisher Phillips opens its new offices at the 52-story City National Plaza tower in DTLA, it will join other traditional firms like law firm Paul Hastings and\ninvestment manager TCW\n. The new space will be more than 250 percent larger than its current Flower Street offices.\n\nThe expansion reflects a nationwide trend in the legal sector.\nIn the first quarter alone, law firms leased 4.6 million square feet of office space across the United States, marking a 25 percent year-over-year increase and the strongest first quarter on record for the sector, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield data cited by CoStar. In total, that activity makes up 8.4 percent of total leasing volume across the top 10 U.S. legal markets.\nIn Los Angeles, office absorption over the past two years has been increasingly dominated by companies including\nlaw firms and financial companies\n, taking the place of tech and entertainment entities, which had been snapping up space between 2021 and 2023, according to Avison Young.\nIn November, law firm Hill, Farrer &amp; Burrill\nannounced\na move into City National Plaza. Hanson Bridgett signed a\nlease\nfor 15,000 square feet at The CalEdison DTLA last July. In 2022, Mayer Brown nearly\ndoubled\nits office space with a 55,000-square-foot, 11-year lease at the Wells Fargo Center, also downtown.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "In the latest instance of adaptive office reuse for housing, a Koreatown office tower is set to be converted into apartments.\nJamison Services is planning to turn a 20-story office building at 3550 Wilshire Boulevard into 495 apartments,\nUrbanize Los Angeles\nreported, citing a\npermit\nrecently issued by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. The building will be called \u201cWalker,\u201d according to a\nproject page\non Jamison\u2019s website.\nIn addition to the nearly 500 units of housing,\nJamison\n\u2019s Walker proposal also calls for the renovation of existing ground-floor amenities as well as the addition of a rooftop amenity deck and penthouse mezzanines. Renderings for the project, designed by Rockefeller Partners Architects, show a rooftop pool and barbecue area being added to the building.\nThe existing ground-floor tenants, such as\nCoffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf\n, will remain in place.\nJamison is no stranger to office-to-residential conversion projects in the Wilshire corridor.\n\nIn November, the Koreatown-based firm started work on a similar adaptive reuse project at\n3325 Wilshire Boulevard\n, across the street from the company\u2019s headquarters at 3333 Wilshire. Nearby, Jamison is also working on a ground-up high-rise complex at\n3600 Wilshire\n. In 2023, the company filed plans to convert a 17-story office tower at\n6380 Wilshire\n, near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, into 210 apartments.\nAs Los Angeles looks to meet its housing goals, which\ninclude\nnearly 457,000 new units by the end of the decade, office-to-residential projects like Jamison\u2019s 3550 Wilshire initiative could help close the gap.\nIn April, the Los Angeles City Council\napproved\na revised Citywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance, which expands the 1999 zoning ordinance that facilitated the creation of over 12,000 housing units in downtown L.A. The revision is part of the broader Citywide Housing Incentive Program to increase housing availability in the city.\nUnder the updated policy, more developers will be able to repurpose underutilized buildings, with the city growing adaptive reuse incentives citywide and reducing eligibility requirements. The original ordinance applied only to buildings constructed before 1974, but the new policy allows conversions of structures at least 15 years old. Projects involving newer buildings or those seeking additional zoning flexibility will be eligible for city approval through a new, streamlined process.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Los Angeles City Council member is appealing to Gov. Gavin Newsom to pump the brakes on a plan to build in the Pacific Palisades.\nCouncil member Traci Park has sent Newsom a letter urging the governor to pause the application of Senate Bill 9 in the Palisades, citing concerns about the law\u2019s approval process posing public safety risks in the wake of the deadly January wildfires,\nWestside Current\nreported.\nPark warned that emergency rebuilding orders in tandem with SB 9, which allows homeowners to split one single-family-zoned lot into two and potentially build up to two housing units on one lot, are being used to convert single-family lots into multiunit developments without any public hearings or environmental review.\n\u201cOpportunistic developers are now using [emergency orders] in conjunction with state density laws to exploit a devastating disaster for their economic advantage,\u201d she wrote, per Westside Current. In her view, SB 9, designed to promote urban infill construction, isn\u2019t well suited for a coastal hillside community in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone like the Palisades, per the Current.\nPark pleaded that SB 9 and related laws permitting increased density in the Palisades be suspended immediately until investigators evaluate the evacuation infrastructure and emergency capacity in the burned enclave. The Pacific Palisades Community Council supported Park\u2019s letter and also submitted a request for immediate action.\nMayor Karen Bass echoed Park\u2019s worries on the matter, pointing out that creating more density in an area where evacuation routes could be restricted could end up being deadly in the next fire.\n\n\u201cWhile Senate Bill 9 (SB 9) was passed to support the creation of more housing across California \u2014 something that our state desperately needs \u2014 legislators in Sacramento could not have foreseen the bill\u2019s impact on the Palisades community as it works to rebuild from one of the worst natural disasters in state history,\u201d Bass said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe ability for developers to use SB 9 to change recently destroyed single-family home lots into multiple residences could drastically further challenge ingress and egress in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFSZ) following the\nworst fire disaster the city has ever faced\n. It could fundamentally alter the safety of the area by straining local infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cI oppose this usage as it relates to rebuilding in the Palisades, and I look forward to continuing to work with Gov. Newsom and state leaders to advocate for the Palisades community and identify a path forward as we continue to rebuild,\u201d Bass continued.\nThere are seven properties listed with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety that currently have active permit applications for duplex development under SB 9, according to Westside Current. That includes two parcels at 768 and 732 Hartzell Streets and another at 1116 Galloway Street. Other addresses with pending applications include 1006 Kagawa Street; 1301 Amalfi Drive; 437 and 425 Mount Holyoke Avenue; and 536 Bienveneda Avenue. None of those permits have been approved yet.\nMeanwhile, another California Senate bill that came under fire \u2014 no pun intended \u2014\nhas been tabled until next year\n. SB 549 would establish a \u201cResilient Rebuilding Authority\u201d to coordinate, accelerate and streamline rebuilding efforts by helping residents in areas impacted by the blazes to navigate the complex permitting process, as well as implement fire-resistant building standards to mitigate future disasters.\nThe legislation was criticized by high-profile figures like\nreality TV personality Spencer Pratt\n, who erroneously claimed it would permit the county to buy up burned lots to build low-income housing for non-Palisades locals. Instead, the county would buy burned lots to rebuild homes and sell them back to returning residents who lived there before the fires.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles County General Medical Center is set for a $120 million overhaul to turn it into the heart of a new health-oriented community.\nCounty supervisors are poised to approve an initial $3.3 million in funding for Centennial Partners\u2019 plans for Boyle Heights hospital,\nThe Los Angeles Times\nreported. It would be the first step in bringing the project to life, a year and a half after Centennial secured an exclusive negotiating agreement for the property.\nUnder the plan, the nearly century-old main 19-story Art Deco building, formerly known as Los Angeles County General Hospital, and the adjacent 41.9-acre campus will be transformed into a community-oriented space with\naffordable housing\nand medical offices as well as retail and other services. Up to 824 residential units are planned for the mixed-use site, though more have been proposed in past iterations.\nCentennial, in a joint venture with\nPrimestor Venture Partners\n, has been granted an authorization for $120 million to dedicate toward remediation. That includes funds totaling $106 million largely coming from state housing grants and the federal American Rescue Plan. The remaining $9 million would be held in contingency and $5 million reserved for county management.\n\nPreviously, Centennial proposed as many as 1,480 to 4,954 mixed-income residential units and between 2.1 million and 4.6 million square feet of commercial space. The preliminary plan, issued in February, forms the basis of a more detailed master plan and environmental report that Centennial is looking to complete by early next year.\nThe Board of Supervisors motion for the $3.3 million in funding would also authorize county staff to seek inclusion of the iconic building on the National Register of Historic Places. For more than 60 years, the structure has been featured in the opening credits of the soap opera \u201cGeneral Hospital.\u201d If it makes the Register, the hospital project would receive additional tax credits to fund construction and preservation.\nThe\nredevelopment\nwon\u2019t come without its challenges, the Times reported. Planners will have to investigate how to mitigate seismic risk, hazardous materials contamination, crumbling infrastructure, old and inefficient buildings, parking shortcomings, disconnected streets, fragmented green spaces and updates to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.\nInitial remedial work on the unoccupied floors of the hospital building is expected to begin in December. Major work will reportedly start in the spring after the master plan and draft environmental impact report are completed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It\u2019s located in Anaheim\u2019s Platinum Triangle district with proximity to Angel Stadium, the Honda Center and Disneyland.\n\u201cThe Axis portfolio generated strong interest from a broad spectrum of investors, developers, and owner-users,\u201d Anthony DeLorenzo, a vice chairman at CBRE who helped facilitate the sale, said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThis transaction reflects the continued momentum in the Anaheim market, where quality assets like Axis stand out\u2026 The seller ultimately selected a capable cash buyer who performed as promised, reinforcing the strength of the offering and execution.\u201d\nThe area around Angel Stadium and the Honda Center is poised for a mixed-use rebirth as part of\nOCVibe, a $4 billion planned entertainment village\neffort spearheaded by Henry and Susan Samueli, owners of the Anaheim Ducks and the Honda Center.\n\nLast month, the Samuelis spent more than $72 million for\nStadium Tower\n, a 12-story office building at 2400 East Katella Avenue. That purchase followed a $64.5 million buy last summer for a 2.4-acre industrial site near Stadium Tower that will serve as offices for OCVibe.\nOCVibe calls for 100 acres of multifamily buildings, two hotels, a 50,000-square-foot food hall, two live event venues and office and retail spaces in the heart of Anaheim. The first phase of the project, which includes the concert venue, commercial space and a park, is expected to open next year. Construction on the final phase is planned to get underway in 2029.\nOffice vacancy in Orange County\nin the second quarter was 19 percent, remaining virtually unchanged year-over-year, according to Colliers\u2019 Q2\nreport\n.

        "content": "When Pennsylvania-based Morgan Properties bought a $500 million portfolio of apartments across the Midwest this spring, the region finally got the recognition that local industry players long thought it deserved.\nThis recent success in Chicago appears to have served as a bellwether for other Midwest markets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our share of problems, but Chicago to me has always been steady,\u201d Chicago-based multifamily broker Brad Feldman of Interra Realty said.\nThe odds on Morgan\u2019s bet were favorable. Rent in the Midwest grew 2.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, MMG Real Estate Advisors found. It was the biggest year-over-year increase in regions across the U.S. in the second quarter, and there\u2019s still room for growth. In that period, the region boasted the nation\u2019s lowest average effective market rent at $1,390.\nMorgan might have deep pockets. But locals have a leg up in benefiting from the Midwest\u2019s promising attributes, thanks to their knowledge of the region\u2019s nuances.\n\u201cI\u2019d say the lion\u2019s share of the deals go to guys that are based here,\u201d Feldman said.\nP\nolitics as usual\nWithin Chicago\u2019s city limits, multifamily investors are walking a delicate tightrope.\nThe region\u2019s strong rent growth and job market are enticing to investors. Still, stubbornly high interest rates and the city\u2019s shaky political landscape are giving them pause.\nHousing policies championed by Mayor Brandon Johnson and his allies, including an anti-gentrification ordinance passed on the city\u2019s Northwest side and an attempted mansion tax that was defeated at the ballot box, have stirred uncertainty for investors. And property tax reforms led by County Tax Assessor Fritz Kaegi are causing whiplash between initial appraisals and final values determined through the\nappeals process\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from institutional type people who say, \u2018talk to us when you get a new mayor,\u2019\u201d Kiser Group multifamily broker Andy Friedman said. \u201cIf we are to get a new mayor that is a Rahm Emanuel type \u2026 I think you would see floodgates open.\u201d\nDevelopers certainly feel the lack of institutional capital. Last year, Chicago recorded its lowest number of multifamily project completions since 2015, according to Institutional Property Advisors. With few deliveries expected this year, vacancy across the metro is below 5 percent for the second consecutive year.\nAlthough the slow pipeline is driving rent growth, it\u2019s also limiting the types\u00a0of buildings\u00a0listed. Older assets are dominating the market, but they\u2019re harder to manage from afar.\n\u201cThe city had a building boom in the 1920s. If you want to buy in Chicago, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s on the menu right now,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cBut it is not often that you see an out-of-state investor come in to invest in a building like that.\u201d\nOlder buildings on the city\u2019s edges present an opportunity for growth because they\u2019re selling for less than $200,000 per unit, unlike the high rises in the city\u2019s core, which are trading for more than $400,000 per unit.\nIn June, Jennifer Pritzker, president and CEO of Tawani Enterprises and cousin to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, sold a six-building portfolio for $45 million to local firm Silver Property Group. The sale of the 263-unit portfolio in the city\u2019s far north Rogers Park neighborhood came out to $171,000 per unit.\nSilver\u2019s principal, Ron Abrams, said that his firm has focused solely on Chicago since its founding 13 years ago. The company owns and operates 100 buildings in the city.\n\u201cBeing here and knowing all the players got us the deal and got us financing,\u201d Abrams said at the time of the purchase.\nSimilarly, Chicago-based investor David Pezzola bought a smaller portfolio of 110 units in the far South Side neighborhood of Beverly for $16.3 million this spring.\nAnd now, seasoned local real estate investor Stuart Handler is testing the hype by listing five midsize multifamily properties on Chicago\u2019s North and South sides.\nHigh-rise sales aren\u2019t at a complete standstill either.\n\u201cOur bidding activity is deeper and broader and better than it was 12 to 24 months ago,\u201d said Chicago-based CBRE multifamily broker John Jaeger, who specializes in selling high- rises.\n\nIn February, Jaeger\u2019s team represented the seller in a $94 million sale of a 20-story West Loop building. The buyer, Portland, Oregon-based real estate investment firm Green Cities, paid what came out to $421,000 per unit.\nAnd in April, Chicago saw the city\u2019s largest apartment sale in nearly two years. Local developer Moceri &amp; Roszak and equity partner Ares Management sold an apartment tower in buzzy Fulton Market for $170 million or $453,000 per unit.\nG\noldilocks zone\nIf an investor wants the economic prowess of Chicago but the political predictability of a smaller Midwest city, then the suburbs might be just right.\nWith easy commuter access via public transit, Chicago\u2019s suburbs benefit from the city\u2019s strong job market without its hectic political environment. And buyers have taken notice. Multifamily sales jumped 65 percent year-over-year in the city\u2019s suburbs in the first quarter of 2025, Interra found. Suburbs located outside of Cook County\nhave performed best\ndue to their more predictable property tax environment.\n\u201cOf these new inbound groups, 85 percent want non-Cook County suburbs,\u201d said CBRE broker Jason Zyck. \u201cThe suburbs remain the favorite location for investment.\u201d\nThe average price per unit in the suburbs rose 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, from $120,349 to $142,935, according to Interra.\nAn analysis by The Real Deal of 27 multifamily properties that sold for more than $10 million in the Chicago metro area late last year found that 17 traded at a markup from their last sale price. Of those, 11 were in the suburbs. That trend continued into the new year, Interra found.\nThere were seven suburban multifamily transactions in the $10 to $50 million range in the first quarter compared to just 13 in all of last year.\nMost recently, a venture of Chicago-based Laramar sold a 242-unit suburban Warrenville complex, the Westlyn, for $59 million or about $245,000 per unit. The buyer was Maryland-based Artemis Real Estate Partners.\nAnd lenders are shelling out for new developments too.\nChicago-based Banner Real Estate in July secured $124 million in construction financing for an apartment complex in the west Chicago suburb of Wheaton.\nM\nidwest momentum\nAfter cities such as Austin, Nashville and Tampa experienced a pandemic-fueled building boom, the Midwest quietly emerged as a potential safe haven for investors spooked by the Sun Belt\u2019s faltering fundamentals.\n\u201cThe Midwest did not get over their skis on development, as other parts of the country did, so in general, the Midwest has a healthy supply-demand balance,\u201d Jaeger said.\nAs Sun Belt cities became oversupplied and interest rates climbed, some deals quickly went south.\nIn contrast to the Midwest, the Southeast saw rents grow by only 0.4 percent, and the Southwest actually saw rents decrease by 0.9 percent, MMG found.\n\u201c[Institutions] that were very focused predominantly on the Sun Belt are seeing those negative trade-outs. They\u2019re seeing completely negative rent growth, where they\u2019re probably 20 or 30 percent below where their pro forma was on rents,\u201d Chicago-based CBRE multifamily broker Justin Puppi said. \u201cThey look to the Midwest, and Chicago specifically, and they see the rent growth and they\u2019re willing to accept that the circumstances are uncertain.\u201d\nDespite being smaller than Chicago, other Midwest cities can support investor interest without some of the complicated political hurdles Chicago faces, Feldman added.\n\u201cMilwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit have been popular with Blackstone and some other groups that are buying both single family and multifamily,\u201d Feldman said.\nAnd so far, supply hasn\u2019t outpaced demand.\nIn the Midwest, there were about 58,000 multifamily units under construction as of the second quarter of 2025 compared to 93,000 in the Northeast, 110,000 in the West and 235,000 in the South, Cushman and Wakefield found.\n\u201cOur debt costs are the same whether you\u2019re in the Sun Belt or you\u2019re in the Midwest,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cSo you can get positive leverage out of the gate, which is probably one of the only areas in the country where you can do that.\u201d",

Bradford Allen last week filed a lawsuit alleging the property\u2019s developer,\nlocally headquartered CRG\n, wasn\u2019t forthright in its negotiations or property management while under contract, and that the would-be buyer should be able to claw back its deposit despite cancelling the transaction.\nPlus,\ndeveloper Mitch Goltz has sold a development site\nfor the delayed, $110 million project at the former People\u2019s Gas site in the Northwest Side\u2019s Portage Park neighborhood. The new owner, Elmhurst-based Prairie Ridge Development, is scaling back the proposal from 346 housing units in one six-story building, to 253 units spread across two buildings \u2014 one four-story building with 213 units and a three-story building with 40 units. At the same time,\nGoltz has been a buyer\n, including for distressed Oak Brook office property.\nThen there\u2019s\nMarty Paris, a condos and apartments developer\nwho just gave back a second Chicago property to a lender while still jousting with other lenders and the village of River Forest over more properties in his firm Sedgewick\u2019s portfolio. Most recently, he surrendered a package of condos at a South Loop building to settle a $12 million mortgage. And he\u2019s\nsuing divorce lawyers for alleged malpractice\nin a case that landed him in jail.\nHowever, it\u2019s far from all bad news, as\nlenders begin to reopen the spigots\nfor Chicago while it\u2019s among the nation\u2019s leaders in rent growth.\n\nDevelopment teams including\nMike Drew\u2019s Structured\nand Adam Friedberg\u2019s Mavrek reeled in over $350 million in refinancing deals for Chicago multifamily projects in recent weeks.\nDrew\u2019s firm and its partners pulled in the\nsecond of two big loans totaling $199 million\nthat they landed this summer to refinance debts at their multi-phase Lincoln Park project.\nAnd\nMavrek retired a $102 million construction loan\nfor its Streeterville project known as the Saint Grand, with a new $106 million loan.\nWhat\u2019s more,\nPacific Life Insurance is dipping into the market\nwith a big West Loop apartment tower listing, showing institutional owners are ready to test the waters as Chicago multifamily pricing increases.\nIn the residential market, a new St. Regis resale listing has a\n91st-floor condo owner bracing for a loss of over $1 million\nafter paying $9.2 million for the unit back in 2022, a price that was briefly the Chicago skyscraper\u2019s largest.\n",

        "content": "With over $1 million in donations, the top fundraiser in the race to fill U.S. Rep. Danny Davis\u2019 downtown Chicago seat is real estate scion Jason Friedman.\nFriedman brings both real estate and political experience to his campaign to represent Illinois\u2019 7th Congressional District, which includes perhaps the highest concentration of real estate value in the state. It\u2019s unclear though, if Friedman will lean into his real estate background, which is barely mentioned in campaign materials.\nSon of prolific investor Al Friedman, also known as the\n\u201cMayor of River North,\u201d\nJason Friedman served as president of his father\u2019s company, Friedman Properties, for 18 years. The 55-year old firm is credited with transforming River North from a gritty industrial hub to the glittering mixed-use neighborhood it is today. Friedman stepped down from the position in 2023, presumably to launch his political career.\nFriedman is entering a crowded field with eight other challengers, including Democratic heavy-hitter state Rep. La Shawn Ford. Ford has already been endorsed by Davis who, at 83-years-old, is stepping down from the seat at the end of his 15th term in January 2027. Because the district is considered safely Democratic, the winner of the March 17 primary will be strongly favored in the following November general election.\nWhoever takes over the seat will step in at a crucial time for the district, which has been\nhammered by distress\nin the commercial real estate market following the pandemic. Chicago\u2019s office vacancy rate began this year at 26.5 percent, the 11th consecutive quarter of record-high availability, according to CBRE.\nBut a new representative will also have to walk a fine line of representing influential commercial landlords and a diverse base of residents across the socioeconomic spectrum. The sprawling district not only includes downtown and Fulton Market, but also parts of the South Side and towns as far west as Oak Park and Proviso Township.\nFriedman\u2019s campaign website downplays his real estate bonafides in favor of highlighting his longtime involvement in politics. It does not mention his father, or Friedman Properties, by name.\nThe site leads with his experience volunteering and working for Democratic politicians including U.S. Rep. Paul Simon and U.S. Senators Carol Moseley Braun and Dick Durbin. He also worked as a domestic policy aide under President Bill Clinton.\nFriedman\u2019s campaign notes he has practiced real estate law and has experience \u201cleading large organizations,\u201d including the Jewish United Fund.\n\n\u201cOver the past twenty years, Jason has supported hundreds of businesses across the city and created thousands of good-paying jobs, including good-paying union jobs, right here in Chicago,\u201d his website reads.\nTop priorities listed on his website include addressing gun violence, supporting unions, improving education and creating job opportunities. He\u2019s also positioned himself as a critic of President Donald Trump, expressing disdain for his efforts to dismantle The U.S. Department of Education and cut social services and consumer protections.\nA news release from his campaign notes that all donations he has received from the first quarter \u201chave been donated by community leaders and grassroots supporters from across the district, state, and country.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what real estate-related policies Friedman plans to campaign on, if any.\nThe Chicago real estate industry has been at odds with city officials over the past few years, though less drama has played out between industry groups and politicians in Congress.\nLobbying groups\nled a successful campaign\nto defeat Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s real estate transfer tax at the ballot box last year and have\nrallied against an anti-gentrification ordinance\nat city hall. They\u2019ve also\nslammed Cook County assessor Fritz Kaegi\nfor a perceived over-correction in\nshifting property tax burden\nfrom homeowners to commercial landlords.\nFriedman Properties has navigated Chicago\u2019s choppy political waters for decades, including under Jason Friedman\u2019s leadership.\nOver the company\u2019s 55 years in the business, it has amassed a 5 million-square-foot commercial real estate portfolio, developed towers, and preserved architectural landmarks. Its properties span the retail, office, multifamily and hotel sectors.\nFriedman\u2019s plan to run was\nfirst reported by Politico\n.",

        "content": "The long-stalled overhaul of the former People\u2019s Gas site in Chicago\u2019s Portage Park neighborhood is on track for a fresh start.\nElmhurst-based Prairie Ridge Development bought the mixed-use project at 3955 North Kilpatrick Avenue from GW Properties, which spent years steering the 6-acre redevelopment through contentious zoning hearings and community negotiations. The sale closed in December but wasn\u2019t previously known, Block Club\nreported\n.\nPrairie Ridge Development\u2019s plan scales back GW\u2019s six-story, 346-unit apartment concept to 253 units across two mid-rise buildings: one with four stories and 213 units, and a second with three stories and 40 units. Prairie Ridge President Brian Pawlik said the redesign lowers density but preserves core elements, including a large retail component and a two-level parking structure with 164 spaces.\nThe $120 million project \u2014 up from GW\u2019s $110 million estimate \u2014 is still slated to include at least 20 percent affordable units, per the city\u2019s ordinance. Preliminary plans for the residential portion also call for a pool, fitness center, fire pit and courtyard-style amenities. The unit mix will include studios, one-, two- and three-bedrooms.\nThe retail piece remains largely unchanged: four one-story buildings, expected to deliver by spring 2027. If city approvals go smoothly, construction could begin as soon as next spring.\n\nPrairie Ridge is working with the city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development on an administrative amendment rather than pursuing a full rezoning, which GW secured last fall after a six-month delay over a project labor agreement.\nThat\nstandoff, involving Alderman Jim Gardiner\nand several trade groups, slowed the project\u2019s timeline and reportedly played a role in GW\u2019s exit. GW founder Mitch Goltz said his firm, which focuses primarily on retail, ultimately decided to redirect resources elsewhere.\n\u201cIf you look at where this project started and where it ended up, it\u2019s not even remotely in the same world,\u201d Goltz told the outlet. \u201cIt started all retail, and before you know it, it was a big residential project.\u201d\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Danny Davis said he will not seek reelection in 2026, opening a rare safe-seat scramble in one of the city\u2019s most development-heavy districts.\nDavis, 83, endorsed longtime ally and state Rep. La Shawn Ford to succeed him, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe announcement came as no surprise \u2014 Ford had already launched his campaign in May \u2014 but Davis\u2019 blessing carries weight in a field that had already ballooned to eight candidates before his announcement. More jumped in almost immediately, including Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin and Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins.\nThe 7th Congressional District has played host to dramatic shifts in the city\u2019s urban core over the course of Davis\u2019 tenure, from the high-rise boom of the South Loop to the transformation of the once-blighted Madison Street corridor and the city\u2019s fast-growing medical district.\nFord is calling Davis\u2019 endorsement a \u201cstrong affirmation of our shared mission.\u201d He pledged to defend civil rights and social services and deflect criticism over a 2014 misdemeanor tax conviction that resulted from a 17-count federal indictment \u2014 charges that were ultimately dropped before Ford pleaded to the lesser count.\n\nHis frontrunner status is far from guaranteed. Attorney Richard Boykin, a former Cook County commissioner and Davis\u2019 former chief of staff, and businessman Jason Friedman, who has raised over $1 million, are also in the running and were largely ignored in the endorsement statements issued Thursday.\nThe race is one of four open-seat House contests in Illinois next year, all in safely Democratic districts, meaning the real fight is the March 2026 primary. Illinois\u2019 delegation is in flux; high-profile figures like Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi and Robin Kelly are leaving for Senate runs, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky is retiring.\nAs for Davis, he says he\u2019s bought a rocking chair. But rather than sitting out the race, he\u2019ll chair Ford\u2019s campaign.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A prominent Michigan Avenue office tower notched a win in a challenging leasing environment.\nEconomic consulting firm Econic Partners signed an 18,700-square-foot lease at the Diamond, the rebranded office tower overlooking Millennium Park, at 150 North Michigan Avenue, marking its first long-term space in the Chicago market, CoStar\nreported\n.\nFormed earlier this year and backed by Goldman Sachs Alternatives, the firm specializes in litigation and regulatory economic consulting and is already active in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Boston and Oakland.\nCBRE\u2019s Brad Serot and Tony Coglianese represented Econic Partners in the lease. Matt Pistorio, Adam Pines and Abby McFadyen of Madison Rose, which holds the tower\u2019s leasing assignments, represented the landlord.\nThe deal represents a symbolic boost for the downtown office market, which is facing historically low demand and rising vacancy, and a step in the right direction for the tower, which has undergone significant repositioning efforts under its new owners: Italy\u2019s billionaire\nGaravoglia family\n, controlling stakeholders in the Campari Group, and local partners R2 Companies and Anagram Capital.\n\nThe ownership group\nacquired the 60-story tower\nfor $60 million in early 2024, less than half its 2017 valuation, and has invested in common-area upgrades and amenities in a bid to lure tenants. The tower\u2019s sloped, diamond-shaped crown has long made it a fixture of Chicago skyline photos, but its location on the eastern edge of the Loop has historically been a leasing challenge due to its distance from major commuter train stations.\nAlongside the Econic lease on the 28th floor, coworking provider Regus took 18,000 square feet on the 8th floor, and law firm Connolly Krause signed for 8,000 square feet on the 10th. Another 58,000 square feet is in lease negotiations, according to Madison Rose.\nBrokers said proximity to Millennium Park, the Magnificent Mile and nearby hotels was a draw for Econic, which expects to host clients from across the U.S. and abroad. The firm will occupy temporary space in the building before moving into its permanent lease next year.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nDeveloped by the two firms in 2019, the 20-story building is about 98 percent occupied and carries an $86 million mortgage taken out in 2021. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman have the listing.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a\nstring of big-ticket multifamily listings\nacross the city, a summer wave stemming from a combination of strong rent growth, limited construction deliveries and owners betting that investor interest in the Midwest will hold steady as Sun Belt markets cool.\nLast month, Vista Property landed a $173 million construction loan to start a Fulton Market tower, while large properties in Streeterville, the West Loop and Hyde Park have all recently come up for sale.\n\nHeadwinds from high interest rates and institutional caution prevail, but pricing on recent West Loop trades has been competitive. The Arkadia, at 765 West Adams Street, sold late last year for $113.3 million, or $324,000 per unit, while a 20-story tower at 123 North Desplaines Street\nfetched $94 million\n\u2014 or roughly $422,000 per unit \u2014 in February.\nRents at top-tier downtown properties rose more than 6 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. The supply pipeline has slowed considerably amid rising construction costs.\nThose conditions are fueling the flurry of listings as landlords look to time the market while occupancy and rents remain strong. It wasn\u2019t clear from Cook County property records whether White Oak still holds a stake in the Milieu; neither White Oak nor Pacific Life responded to the outlet\u2019s requests for comment.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

She also represented the ownership entity in its purchase from St. Regis developer Magellan, a transaction that briefly held the mark of the tower\u2019s most expensive sale ever.\nIt was eclipsed a few months later when\nMexican mining billionaire German Larrea spent $20.6 million\nto purchase a 71st-floor unit within the 101-story building designed by Chicago-based architect Jeanne Gang\u2019s Studio Gang.\nThe new St. Regis listing is Chicago\u2019s third-biggest asking price for a condo. Venture capitalist David Kronfeld, the founder of JK&amp;B Capital, is seeking the highest price,\nat $11.7 million\n, for his 64th-floor unit inside Park Tower, at 800 North Michigan Avenue. That property has been for sale for over a year.\n\nThe second-largest asking price for a publicly listed Chicago condo is $8.9 million for a penthouse unit inside the Palmolive Building, at 159 East Walton Place. It was listed in 2022 for $10.9 million but hasn\u2019t yet sold and has been through several price cuts.\nThe St. Regis listing would mark the latest loss in unit value for a resale deal. It follows last year\u2019s $117 million bulk sale of 84 developer-owned units by Magellan to Denver-based GD Holdings, a holding company for a Mexican denim company. GD also bought the 192-room hotel portion of the skyscraper for over $100 million in 2023.\nSt. Regis condos that still haven\u2019t been sold to an individual owner also retain some appeal, as GD sold a two-unit package on the\n52nd floor earlier this year for $9 million\ntotal to a single buyer. Plus, billionaire\nCitadel founder Ken Griffin in April sold off\nthe final two unfinished floors of his stack of raw units at No. 9 Walton earlier this year for $15.9 million, putting his total losses on his record-breaking four-floor purchase inside the building at $23.5 million.\nThe largest price for a finished condo in Chicago so far this year came at 4 East Elm Street, when former\nFortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari\nsold his 5,400-square-foot Gold Coast penthouse in the Elm and State building for $10.1 million.\n",

        "content": "A prime slice of Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast is up for grabs again, after numerous failed attempts to develop it.\nThe development site at 12\u201316 West Maple Street, next door to longtime neighborhood mainstay Maple &amp; Ash, hit the market through Greenstone Partners, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe parcel spans 7,900 square feet, with one four-story retail building. It\u2019s being sold by Calmwater Capital, a California-based lender that seized the site in 2020 via deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nCalmwater took control after a venture led by Maple &amp; Ash co-owners David Pisor and Jim Lasky defaulted on a $14.9 million loan issued in 2018. The partners had paid $13.1 million for the site the year before and pitched an ultra-luxury, 22-story condo tower with just 12 units. That plan fell apart. A second proposal, a 34-story residential building floated by another developer in 2022, also failed to materialize.\nCalmwater and Greenstone are marketing the site as one of the few remaining development opportunities in one of the city\u2019s most upscale neighborhoods, which is seeing a recent wave of activity. The listing notes proximity to the reimagined Carmine\u2019s and Tavern on Rush, which are both reopening after multi-year upgrades and the broader retail rebound.\n\nThe property\u2019s DX-7 zoning allows dozens of units. The listing has no public asking price, but it\u2019s expected to fetch between $10 million and $12 million, Spitz estimated.\nThe balance on the defaulted mortgage at the time of the deed transfer is unclear. But after years of false starts, the site is back in play. Developers eyeing a Gold Coast comeback may finally take a swing.\nRecent real estate activity in Gold Coast includes the pocket listing of a\nhistoric mansion\nfor nearly $9 million. A\nvintage apartment building\nat 1100 North Dearborn, held by a family office for more than half a century, sold for just $174,000 per unit recently.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Embattled developer Marty Paris recently signed his second deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for a multifamily building in the past few months.\nLender Republic Bank of Chicago filed a foreclosure complaint against Paris last summer, claiming he defaulted on a $12 million loan backed by a group of 26 condos at 1464 Michigan Avenue. Paris eventually handed back the keys to the lender last month via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreement, public records show.\nThe condos are located within a 25-story, 210-unit South Loop building known as The Marquee.\nParis\u2019s firm, Sedgwick Properties, allegedly missed making property tax payments due for 2022 and 2023, the lawsuit said. Republic put up more than $636,000 to satisfy the tax obligations at the property, which constitutes a default by the landlord, the foreclosure complaint stated.\nAround the same time that Republic filed its complaint against Paris regarding the South Loop condos, the bank also filed a separate foreclosure complaint against his firm regarding a loan backed by an apartment building at 146 West Erie Street.\nThe bank claimed at the time that Paris had\nfallen behind on payments\ntoward a $36 million loan backed by the 14-story, 31-unit River North building known as The Rhone. In April, Paris\ngave that building back to the bank via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure\nagreement as well.\nParis and Republic did not respond to requests for comment.\nBefore Paris gave up the Rhone, the building had faced its fair share of troubles.\nParis\u2019 Sedgwick Development started the project as a condo tower in 2017.\n\nIt encountered several delays and restarted in 2021 using its address as a name. It also was trimmed from 15 stories to 14, losing its amenity floor. Paris blamed the city\u2019s lethargic condo market, worsened by the pandemic and civil unrest downtown, for the project\u2019s long timeline.\nThe Rhone (its fourth name since the development launched) was ultimately marketed as rentals seeking an average of $10,000 a month.\nMechanic\u2019s liens fights flared up in 2021 with contractors alleging nonpayment for work totaling over $1 million.\nThe two foreclosures come on the heels of other personal and professional troubles.\nVolatile divorce proceedings landed him in Cook County jail three times, mainly for disputing court orders to pay his ex-wife\u2019s lawyers. Although his divorce has been finalized,\nhe sued his lawyers in the proceedings earlier this year\n, alleging they abandoned him on the eve of his trial and later conspired to collect fees that helped land him in jail.\nAs a result of his ongoing financial troubles, he filed for personal bankruptcy and on behalf of one of his subsidiaries.\nOne of those bankruptcy filings\ntriggered a personal guarantee clause\nin a $26 million loan backed by an apartment building at 301 West North Avenue that Paris had defaulted on. The bankruptcy and the foreclosure complaint related to 301 West North Avenue are still pending.\nIn suburban River Forest, a separate legal battle is playing out over an unused development site where Paris\u2019s firm\nproposed building a condo development in 2016\nbut has yet to deliver it.\nA tangle of mechanics liens, and complaints from a lender and the village of River Forest is still working its way through Cook County court.",

        "content": "The founder of one of Chicago\u2019s most prolific construction firms has parted ways with his longtime Lincoln Park mansion, notching the priciest home sale in the neighborhood so far this year.\nJohn Novak, head of Novak Construction, sold his five-bedroom, 7,800-square-foot home at 1970 North Burling Street for $6.75 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The price comes out to about $865 per square foot. Emily Sachs Wong of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate had the listing.\nThe price is about 75 percent of Novak\u2019s $8.95 million asking price when the home was first listed nearly a decade ago, but still enough to top the charts for single-family deals in Lincoln Park this year.\nDesigned by high-end architecture firm Liederbach &amp; Graham in 2010, the house features a walled courtyard, industrial design touches and extensive use of Chicago common brick inside and out. Other standout details include steel staircases, a glass solarium roof supported by exposed beams and a barrel-vaulted shower with balcony access.\nA long glass wall opens the home to its hidden courtyard, which once famously featured a towering blue sculpture \u2014 \u201cChevron\u201d by John Henry \u2014 that neighbors despised. A 2013 compromise with then\u2013Alderman Michele Smith led Novak to remove the sculpture in exchange for keeping the extra-tall garden wall.\n\nThe home changed hands in late July at just under 97 percent of its most-recent asking price, tying with an April Gold Coast sale as the 14th most expensive residential transaction in the Chicago area this year. Only one home in the city, a River North mansion that sold for nearly $7.2 million in June, has traded for more this year. The top five home sales citywide so far have all been condos.\nNovak has built thousands of residential, commercial and institutional projects through his firm, which reports over $500 million in annual revenue and employs more than 150 people.\nHis family\u2019s ties to Liederbach &amp; Graham extend beyond the Burling mansion: the architects also designed a Wicker Park home for Novak\u2019s daughter, sold in 2022, and a metal-sided home on Armitage for his son, which was listed last year.\nThe buyers of the Burling Street property have not yet been identified in public records.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Some heavyweights of Chicago\u2019s commercial real estate industry are butting heads in court over nearly $2 million tied up in a failed apartments transaction.\nChicago-based Bradford Allen, co-founded by Laurence Elbaum and Jeffrey Bernstein, filed a lawsuit in Cook County court last week against an affiliate of CRG, the real estate development arm of locally headquartered construction and design conglomerate Clayco, after a $38 million deal got canceled.\nBradford Allen insists it should get back $1.9 million it deposited into escrow as it went into contract to buy the 134-unit building that CRG built at the intersection of Milwaukee and Armitage Avenues on the border of the trendy Bucktown and Logan Square neighborhoods.\nBut CRG so far has stood firm in that it has the right to keep the money, alleging Bradford Allen didn\u2019t live up to its contractual obligations as part of the sale of the property known as A.M. 1980 Residences at 1980 North Milwaukee.\nBradford entered into a contract to buy the property back in November, according to the lawsuit. But it tried to pull out of the deal by claiming that the CRG affiliate that owned the property misrepresented its operating expenses as well as lease terms. The seller\u2019s moves and alleged failures to disclose certain financial matters amount to a breach of its warranties made in the marketing process, Bradford claims.\nEven as Bradford was searching for financing to close the deal, and when it ran into issues with the building\u2019s management, it opted to extend the closing date for the deal in early March, the lawsuit shows. But that became a problem, too, because Bradford felt that Chicago\u2019s controversial new Northwest Side Preservation Ordinance that gives tenants the right of first refusal to buy their buildings complicated the deal.\nThe building is in the program\u2019s pilot zone, so Bradford claimed CRG now had to offer tenants the right of first refusal to buy the building as part of complying with the new rule, which went into effect March 1. Bradford terminated its contract with CRG on March 11, it said.\nBradford alleges CRG\u2019s leases were flawed because \u201cnearly half\u201d failed to show the amounts being charged for utilities or the formula being used to charge tenants. Bradford also claimed it was impossible to tell which units, if any, were set aside for subsidized renters through Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, making it impossible to tell if the building was complying with the ordinance. Bradford later learned the building\u2019s unoccupied units were all designated as affordable units, which amounted to a further violation of the city\u2019s affordable housing rule, the suit alleges.\n\nAdditionally, CRG allegedly tried to pass on $200,000 in costs to Bradford for contracts for work on the property and contracts for service and maintenance workers, among other costs that the would-be buyer said it shouldn\u2019t have had to shoulder.\nEven though Bradford couldn\u2019t close the deal, it alleges the disagreements over the leasing and contract technicalities at the property constituted a seller\u2019s default on the purchase and sale agreement and should require the return of the escrow deposit, which Bradford increased last winter in order to extend the inspection period.\n\u201cFailing to evict holdover tenants, pay expenses incurred in the normal course of business, raising employee salaries, failing to engage sufficient staff and not marketing units for rent are not in accordance with Milwaukee &amp; Armitage\u2019s normal maintenance and management practices,\u201d Bradford said in the suit.\nCRG declined to comment, and an attorney for Bradford said the firm declined to comment. CRG has yet to file a response in court.\nThe property is still on the market, and another buyer has signed a letter of intent to purchase, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield materials. Cushman\u2019s Brad Smith and Jack Maloney are handling the listing. The identity of the new buyer hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed.\nCRG developed the building with the help of a construction loan for more than $23 million from Iowa-based Principal Life Insurance, originated in 2017, public records show. CRG retired the construction debt in 2021 with a new $24 million mortgage loan, also from Principal. CRG has signed off on maturity date extensions with the lender twice in the years since, first to buy another year until April 2025, and again a few months ago to push out the due date to April 2026, public records show.\nBradford Allen has been a buyer of multiple classes of big properties in recent years, having struck deals across the nation for offices and hotels along with mixed-use development sites, including in Arlington Heights in Chicago\u2019s northwest suburbs where it\u2019s building a large commercial campus set to reshape a southern corridor within the town.\n",

        "content": "Chicago-area homebuyers faced record-setting prices in June, as strong demand and tight inventory pushed the cost of housing to new peaks locally and nationwide.\nThe median price for a home in the city reached $400,000, a 5.8 percent increase from June 2023 and the highest on record, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing the Chicago Association of Realtors. Across the nine-county Chicago metro area, prices climbed 3.9 percent to a record $389,450.\nThe national median home price also hit an all-time high of $435,300, a 2 percent jump from the previous year. While June is typically the priciest month for buyers due to seasonal trends, the latest figures reflect more than just timing; they signal resilience in the broader U.S. economy and a rebound in consumer confidence.\nChicago\u2019s pace of price growth outstripped the national average. Home prices rose 6.09 percent in May, second only to New York among the 20 major metros tracked by the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. Most other cities saw increases below 3 percent, and some even experienced declines. Chicago was also one of just five metros where price growth accelerated from April to May.\n\nThe sharp price hikes are fueled by two main factors: a persistent lack of housing inventory and room for post-pandemic growth. While explosive gains hit many markets during the pandemic-era housing boom, Chicago\u2019s price appreciation was more subdued, leaving space for price growth now. The city has less than half the inventory of pre-pandemic levels, forcing buyers to pay top dollar for limited options.\nSales activity has picked up slightly. Chicago home sales in June were up 2.7 percent year-over-year, while the metro area saw a 7.2 percent increase. Both figures are below pre-pandemic norms. Chicago\u2019s sales last month amounted to 85 percent of the June average from 2015 to 2019.\nZillow forecasted a 1.5 percent dip in Chicago-area prices over the next year, mirroring projected trends in other major cities. While that may offer some relief to prospective buyers, housing affordability is a growing concern.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Prosecutors called his cooperation \u201ccritical,\u201d crediting him with helping secure search warrants and guiding FBI interviews that may have deterred further misconduct inside the assessor\u2019s office.\nJudge Sunil Harjani, who handed down the sentence Tuesday, said the case sends a clear message that \u201cearly cooperation, open cooperation, full cooperation can be beneficial in terms of the ultimate outcome of any criminal case.\u201d\n\nPerez admitted to steering favorable outcomes on property tax appeals, but his defense attorney argued he didn\u2019t artificially reduce valuations that couldn\u2019t be justified. The defense emphasized his role in exposing a workplace culture hostile to whistleblowers.\nThe case heats up the spotlight on the influence private tax attorneys and consultants can exert on assessments in Cook County. Despite the depth of Perez\u2019s cooperation, federal prosecutors acknowledged that no charges were brought against other employees or law firms he implicated, citing \u201clegal and factual factors\u201d beyond his control.\nHis work added to a growing list of public employees charged with misconduct tied to Cook County\u2019s property tax apparatus.The list now includes former assessor\u2019s office staffers Basilio Clausen and Lavdim Memisovski, both of whom pleaded guilty, as well as a former Board of Review employee sentenced to jail time for a separate bribery scheme.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Chicago billionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s firm Walton Street Capital and its partner Glenstar thought they were buying at the bottom of the market when they scooped up a big office complex in suburban Bannockburn out of foreclosure in 2015.\nThe floor turned out to be lower than they anticipated, following a pandemic that vaporized demand for office space and ensuing interest rate hikes that cut further into commercial real estate values.\nAnthony Donato, a solar-power developer based in the northern suburbs of Chicago, bought the five-building, 530,000-square-foot Bannockburn Lakes office park at 2121-2355 Waukegan Road for $17 million, about $32 per square foot and about 40 percent lower than the property\u2019s 2015 purchase by a joint venture of Walton Street and Glenstar.\nDonato plans to remove office uses from at least two of the five identical three-story buildings, and turn the other two into experience-oriented assets geared toward youth and family customers.\nHe has already filed redevelopment plans with the village of Bannockburn since completing the deal. Village documents confirm he purchased all five buildings in the complex this month and show he wants to turn at least some of the space inside one of the structures, at 2201 Waukegan, into a recreational sports training facility, primarily to be used as a home base by local youth soccer club Pegasus FC. That idea is set to be discussed by Bannockburn officials next week, records show.\n\u201cOffices in general are overbuilt right now,\u201d Donato said. He will consider further reimagination of the site in the near future, village documents indicate. \u201cWe won\u2019t be close to 100 percent leased right away. But I\u2019m a hands-on individual and I live close to the units and my goal is to fix them up,\u201d said Donato, who has some experience in retail and multifamily real estate while making his first foray into a major commercial office property with the deal.\nThe sellers, both titans of Chicago\u2019s commercial real estate scene, took a rough loss on their investment in the properties.\nThe Walton Street and Glenstar venture bought three of the five buildings out of foreclosure a decade ago for a little over $22 million. That set of buildings was 53 percent vacant at the time. Walton Street and Glenstar paid close to $5 million more for a fourth building on the campus in 2015, and then another $6.4 million in 2017 for the fifth building, at 2121 Waukegan, when Chicago-based real estate firm Ameritus sold it.\n\nGlenstar and Walton Street planned to embark on a $10 million renovation to bring new office tenants to the property. They took on a debt package from Square Mile Capital, which was rebranded in 2021 to Affinius Capital, to aid with the turnaround of the property; while Walton Street and Glenstar notched several modifications of their Square Mile mortgage for the Bannockburn deal, presumably to extend the maturity date or amount of their credit line, it\u2019s unclear how much they ultimately ended up on the hook for with the lender.\nBut vacancy hardly improved during their tenure with the property, as a website for Bannockburn Lakes shows more than 200,000 square feet currently available to lease. Donato said the office buildings are about 38 percent leased currently. A spokesperson for Glenstar said the firm had no comment, and Walton Street didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nDan Deuter of Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokered the sale to Donato. The buyer said he intends to hire JLL\u2019s Chris Cummins as a leasing agent for the property.\nThe trade comes as another big Bannockburn property gears up for a transition, and just after a separate Chicago CRE bigwig,\nWanxiang\u2019s Larry Krueger\n, handed a midsize Bannockburn office building back to its lender to settle a foreclosure lawsuit brought against Krueger\u2019s firm for a maturity default on a mortgage debt. Furthermore, an office complex in neighboring Lincolnshire that was abandoned by its largest tenant Aon to be left nearly totally vacant\ntraded last year to Woodcrest Capital for just $6.2 million\n, down 95 percent from its last sale for $148 million made in 2012.\nMeanwhile,\nRoss Perot Jr.\u2019s Dallas-based firm Hillwood\nis in talks to buy 80 acres of the former Trinity International University campus for about $35 million, with plans to redevelop it into a commercial complex.\nGlenstar and Walton Street have taken some licks in the office market but have proven to be believers in Chicago and its surroundings in recent months. Walton Street paid down over\n$56 million toward a debt package on a Magnificent Mile skyscraper\nlast year in order to refinance, while\nGlenstar is aiding Minnesota investor Patrick Halloran\nin a $30 million renovation of a 41-story office tower on Chicago\u2019s Wacker Drive following its purchase out of financial distress.\n",

        "content": "One of the Chicago area\u2019s most relied-on residential real estate vendors is shuttering operations, and brokerages are rushing to fill the gap.\nVHT Studios, which has provided listing photos for an estimated 70 percent of the metro\u2019s homes for sale, will cease operations on Aug. 31 and stop taking new orders after Aug. 5, according to a surprise announcement last week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe Rosemont-based firm has been a go-to for Chicago-area agents for nearly three decades, and its abrupt departure is forcing brokerages to find quick replacements during a key stretch of the home-selling season. It comes three years after 3D-scanning tech company Matterport bought VHT Studios in 2022 and a little over a year since CoStar Group in turn\nacquired Matterport\nin April 2024.\n\u201cWe were absolutely blindsided,\u201d said Laura Ellis, president of residential sales at Baird &amp; Warner.\nEllis received VHT\u2019s announcement on a Tuesday and had hired its account manager, Shannon Lange, by Thursday to launch an in-house photo services department. By Sunday, the firm had added two more staffers with the goal of making sure agents \u201cfeel very little difference\u201d in operations by the time VHT stops accepting orders.\nEllis estimates Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s new photography unit will cost about $500,000 annually, roughly what it had been paying VHT to shoot 80 percent of its 5,000 to 7,000 annual listings.\n\nVHT\u2019s parent company, CoStar, said the closure was a strategic decision to cut losses and shift focus to Matterport, its 3D imaging subsidiary. VHT brought in $14 million in revenue last year but lost over $10 million, CoStar CEO Andrew Florance said.\nOther large brokerages said they\u2019re better positioned to adapt. Coldwell Banker will steer agents toward alternate vendors via its Listing Concierge platform. @properties Christie International Real Estate\u2019s and Jameson Sotheby\u2019s said they already have relationships with other photography partners.\nBut the shutdown leaves uncertainty for roughly 100 freelance photographers who previously worked with VHT in the region. Coldwell\u2019s Chicago president, Ayoub Rabah, said he hopes many are absorbed by other agencies.\nThe shift underscores brokerages\u2019 growing reliance on streamlined marketing tech. CoStar\u2019s retreat from traditional photography, even as listing quality remains paramount, highlights a changing calculus in real estate services, where vendor losses create more vertically integrated solutions in addition to operational headaches.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Hines and La Caisse\u2019s 10 South Riverside may have landed its next big fish.\nInteractive Brokers Group is closing in on a lease at 10 South Riverside Plaza, seeking to consolidate its Chicago offices after a previous deal fell apart in late-stage negotiations, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe electronic trading firm is in advanced talks to lease roughly 60,000 square feet at the tower, which recently underwent a $75 million renovation. If finalized, the move would combine Interactive Brokers\u2019 current offices \u2014 60,000 square feet at 209 South LaSalle and a 40,000-square-foot sublease at 300 South Riverside \u2014 into a single West Loop location ahead of its lease expirations next year.\nCBRE is representing both sides in the deal, with Mark Cassata and Bill Sheehy repping the tenant and Kelsey Scheive and Kelsey Morgan handling leasing for La Caisse.\nThe pivot comes after a failed lease at 300 South Riverside, where the company had been negotiating for a 53,000-square-foot space before talks collapsed.\n\nThat building\u2019s financial distress may have played a role. The land beneath 300 South Riverside is owned separately, and the ground lease holder, World Wide Group, recently missed a payment deadline on a $167 million mortgage tied to the parcel, according to CoStar. The building\u2019s owner, Third Millennium Group, also holds a $175 million loan from Shinhan Bank on the tower itself.\nSuch capital stack complexity has become increasingly common as building owners navigate devalued assets, tight credit and expensive tenant build-outs in the post-pandemic market. In some cases, like R.M. Chin\u2019s cancelling a lease at 801 South Canal, landlords have failed to deliver promised tenant improvement allowances or have even floated converting office buildings to data centers.\nThe pending lease at 10 South Riverside offers a win for its owners, who are trying to backfill space at a time when the building is only 65 percent leased, well below the downtown average.\nLanding a publicly traded tenant like Interactive Brokers, which reported nearly $5.2 billion in 2024 revenue, would validate the recent renovation and stabilize occupancy in what\u2019s been a challenging office leasing environment.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The offices span the seventh and eighth floors in the 27-story building and mark a notable increase in space from a small office at 201 Mission Street a few years ago, according to the Business Times.\nCompanies like Postman are betting on San Francisco\u2019s bounceback as several firms seek office space amid a stubbornly high office vacancy rate; last quarter, nearly 35 percent of San Francisco offices sat empty, according to a\nreport\nfrom Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\n\u201cIn the tech community, there\u2019s a lot of optimism,\u201d Abhinav Asthana, founder and CEO of Postman, told the Business Times. \u201cSeeing that energy again is very motivating.\u201d\nPostman plans to double its headcount in San Francisco from its current number of about 125 over the next year. It\u2019s currently hiring for 65 Bay Area roles, according to Bisnow.

        "content": "Ellis Partners could turn a former American National Red Cross building in Oakland into housing for senior citizens.\nOn Thursday, the San Francisco-based real estate investor and developer filed an application with the city of Oakland to build a seven-story, 197-unit facility at 6230 Claremont Avenue, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. The firm said senior housing would be the most financially feasible development option at the site.\nThe developer initially considered market-rate housing at the site, but pivoted to senior living because it is more financially feasible to build in the current market conditions, Patrick Flynn, senior vice president at Ellis Partners, told the Business Times.\n\u201cSenior housing is feasible in a market where things are tight,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cThe financing of it is better, and then the income side is better.\u201d\nThe new senior living facility would include amenities like a theater, fitness center, gaming area, open-air central courtyard and an outdoor terrace, according to the Business Times. To bring the vision to life, Ellis Partners is teaming up with Spirit Living Group, a San Anselmo-based company that develops, owns and operates senior housing communities across the Bay Area.\n\nThe American National Red Cross has owned the site since 1999 and used it as a blood donation center before shutting it in 2023 and listing it for sale. Ellis Partners put a bid in to buy the property at the time and lost to another buyer, though that sale ended up falling through, leading Red Cross to reach out to Ellis Partners for help redeveloping the site.\nEllis Partners owns\nvarious\noffice and multifamily properties across the Bay Area. Last August, the firm partnered with\nFlynn Properties\nto acquire the 631 Howard Street office building in San Francisco for $36.4 million. In February, Ellis\nacquired\na technology park in Sunnyvale for $15.5 million.\nMeanwhile, The Point at Rockridge, another senior living facility with 148 assisted-living and memory-care units, is on the market after going up for sale last month. Angelo Gordon and Company and Auctus Capital Partners bought the property in 2018 for $61.4 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company plans to move into the space in mid-November, a spokesperson told the Business Times, though it remains unclear if the new space will be designated as Brex\u2019s headquarters.\nBrex followed in other companies\u2019 footsteps in 2021 by abandoning its 60,000-square-foot offices at 405 Howard Street and transitioning to a headquarters-less model. At the time, company co-founders Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras relocated to Los Angeles, though Dubugras relocated to Palo Alto two years later. That year, Brex opened an 8,300-square-foot office at 85 Second Street in San Francisco.\n\u201cAs [artificial intelligence] continues to take the tech scene by storm, it\u2019s imperative we have a strong presence in San Francisco,\u201d a spokesperson told the Business Times when the company secured the Second Street office. \u201cSan Francisco and the Bay Area continue to thrive as a hotspot for startups and founders, attracting some of the brightest minds in the industry.\u201d\nBrex is the latest Bay Area-based company to recommit to office space after paring down or leaving its offices altogether during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, Snowflake eliminated its San Mateo headquarters designation, but late last year, the cloud-based data and analytics firm subleased a 773,000-square-foot campus in Menlo Park from Meta. Coinbase also got rid of its San Francisco headquarters designation in 2021; it\nsigned a 150,000-square-foot lease at Mission Rock\nin May, though it is not going to consider that office its headquarters.\nThe AI sector is expected to increase office occupancy and attract tens of thousands of new workers to San Francisco and the Bay Area, according to\nCBRE\n. The firm predicts that over the next five years, AI companies will go from occupying 5 million square feet of offices to 21 million and bringing 50,000 to 60,000 new jobs to the region.\nBrex employs around 1,100 people globally and boasts about $1.5 billion in funding, a company spokesperson told the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Bay Area lodging market is feeling the heat this summer.\nAs hotels in the Bay Area and across California fall into loan default and foreclosure, hotel sales in general have also suffered,\nThe Mercury News\nreported.\n\u201cCalifornia individual hotel sales continue to lag,\u201d Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, said in a report cited by The Mercury News. \u201cHigher interest rates and continued disconnect between buyer and seller price expectations continue to create downward pressure on hotel sales transactions.\u201d\nOver the first six months of this year, the number of hotels sold in California declined when compared with totals during the same period in 2024, according to Atlas Hospitality Group. An estimated 113 hotels were bought in California in the first half of the year, down 7.4 percent from the 122 hotels that traded hands statewide over the same period last year.\nForeclosures have fetched some of the highest sales prices across the state. The largest hotel sales in three counties were all foreclosures; of those, one was in downtown Oakland and the other in downtown San Jose.\nOn July 8, the\nOakland Marriott City Center\n, a 500-room hotel attached to the Oakland Convention Center, was taken back by lender Invesco in a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million. In May,\nBrightSpire Capital seized\nthe 541-room Signia by Hilton hotel in downtown\nSan Jose\nin a foreclosure that valued the property at $80 million. In Southern California, the loan on the 397-room Line Hotel in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown was foreclosed in a transaction placing its value at $68 million.\n\u201cThese three sales accounted for a total of [nearly $218.2] million of sales volume, which is 15.7 percent of the entire dollar volume through the first six months of 2025,\u201d Reay said. The total sales volume during the first half of this year was almost $1.4 billion, according to Atlas.\n\nThose list-topping foreclosure transactions are followed by a bevy of low-priced sales that point to troubles in the hotel market at large.\nLast October, the 162-room Courtyard Oakland Downtown was bought for $10.6 million, marking a 76 percent decrease from its prior value. That same month, the 289-room\nRadisson Oakland Airport\ngot an appraisal of $15 million \u2014 a 70 percent drop from its previous value, according to The Mercury News.\nThe 142-room\nHyatt House Pleasant Hill\nwas foreclosed on in June. The month before, the 128-room Hyatt House Pleasanton was seized through foreclosure. The dual-branded AC Hotel and Residence Inn in downtown Oakland went back to lenders in a streamlined foreclosure process in April after Hawkins Way Capital defaulted on a $112 million loan tied to the property. Meanwhile, another Hyatt property, the 112-room Hyatt Place/Newark Silicon Valley, is in default and could be taken by its lender through a foreclosure, according to The Mercury News.\nOther hotels, meanwhile, have been shutting down entirely. Last summer, the\nHilton Oakland Airport Hotel\nabruptly shut down, eliminating 152 jobs. In January, the 145-room Waterfront Hotel in Oakland\u2019s Jack London Square also suddenly shut down. The Radisson Oakland Airport has permanently closed.\nDuring the first half of the year, average nationwide purchase prices were about $149,800 per room, or a 16.4 percent decrease from the $179,200 price per room over H1 2024, according to Atlas. Northern California saw a sharper decline than Southern California, Atlas said. NorCal\u2019s average sales price per room was $129,500 in the first half of the year, down 28 percent from $180,200 year-over-year. SoCal\u2019s average purchase price was $175,900 per room in t, a 1.3 percent decline from $178,200 in the same period in 2024.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property spans more than 9,000 square feet and features eight bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a Moroccan-themed dining room and a roof deck with a bar.\nThe home first went\nup for sale\nlast fall but was soon taken off the market. It went back on the market when the Decorator Showcase began in late April with an asking price of $19.5 million.\nA quick change of hands could mean the home sold in an all-cash deal, according to the Standard.\nThe Pac Heights home underwent a makeover in anticipation of the showcase and had a buyer secured by the time the showcase closed in May. Every year, the Decorator Showcase takes place in a different home to highlight the work of various interior designers in each room. Most of the homes featured are in the city\u2019s priciest northern neighborhoods like Pac Heights, Presidio Heights and Sea Cliff.\nWhile the mansion sold shortly after being featured, the property spotlighted in last year\u2019s show \u2014 also in Pacific Heights \u2014 has yet to find a buyer. That Dutch Colonial home, built in 1899, has an asking price of $26 million. The house, located at 2898 Broadway, is still\non the market\nwith its original $26 million price tag.\n\nRevamping the Broadway property for the show presented unexpected \u201cchallenges,\u201d according to designer Geoffrey De Sousa, who leads the design board for the event and designed the living room in this year\u2019s Pac Heights manse. The five-floor home has no garage parking or elevator and the kitchen is in an unusual spot on the upper levels. It wasn\u2019t financially feasible to make those changes in time for the show.\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything beyond our abilities,\u201d de Sousa told the Standard. \u201cWe just need the time and money.\u201d\nAs seen with the latest Pac Heights sale, being featured in the showcase can have an \u201cextremely positive effect, both in terms of exposure and goodwill,\u201d according to Steven Mavromihalis of Compass, who has represented several Decorator Showcase homes in the past.\nBut a lot of eyes can also prove to be a hurdle for some.\n\u201cA lot of very affluent people would much rather not purchase a home that has been visited by thousands of adoring fans of architecture and design,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The former Marin County campus of the Birkenstock shoe company is headed for redevelopment as a world-class art and design museum.\nThe Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity, dedicated to the legacy of\nmidcentury designers Ray and Charles Eames\n, is buying the 88.5-acre property in Novato for $36 million, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nreported. The nonprofit currently operates out of a warehouse in\nRichmond\n.\nLocated at 8171 Redwood Boulevard, the 166,000-square-foot campus includes a 123,000-square-foot warehouse and a two-story, 43,000-square-foot office building. The warehouse will be repurposed to include office space for the institute as well as retail and restaurants next to various sculpture gardens and plazas.\nHow much it will cost to transform the site into a museum remains to be seen, though John Cary, president and CEO of the Eames Institute, believes it will be much more than what it\u2019s paying for the property, according to the Chronicle.\n\u201cWe love that it\u2019s this billboard, this iconic gateway into Novato,\u201d Cary told the Chronicle. \u201cThere is a lot of mystery and intrigue around it. We are just excited to turn it into a magical destination.\u201d\nThe acquisition of the Birkenstock campus is \u201ca transformational step for the Eames Institute,\u201d Cary said in a statement, calling it \u201cthe culmination of a long-held dream and our deep commitment to the North Bay community,\u201d per\nDezeen\n. \u201cThis extraordinary space will enable us to expand our programming and reach a broader audience, while serving as a permanent anchor for creativity and innovation in the Bay Area.\u201d\n\nTo bring the vision to life, the Eames Institute hired famed Swiss architecture firm\nHerzog &amp; de Meuron\nto design the redevelopment. Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s past Bay Area work includes the de Young Museum in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park.\nThe former Birkenstock property was built in 1964 as a distribution center for publisher McGraw Hill. The Eames Archives in Richmond currently has a tourist waitlist of nearly 1,000, and it has been as high as 4,000 since it opened in February 2024.\nThe hope is to attract 200,000 visitors annually once the new museum opens in 2028.\n\u201cOne of my dreams is to have big yellow school buses roll up here,\u201d Cary told the Chronicle. \u201cJust to blow little kids\u2019 pea-brain minds.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Members of the Menlo Circus Club rub shoulders over polo matches, tennis tournaments and galas on a former Atherton estate that traces its roots to 1920, when a group of children riding ponies put on a show for their parents.\nThe nearby neighborhood, which gets its name from the members-only club, played host to the Bay Area\u2019s priciest residential deal this year, a home at 81 Somerset Lane that traded in March for\n$51.5 million\n.\nWhile the closing hasn\u2019t opened the floodgates to $50 million deals, prices are generally ticking up in the area, brokers say. The tech industry is continuing to buy, fueling hope that the region\u2019s high-end listings may push past high interest rates and the finicky stock market.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum in the Bay Area towards tech\u2019s future and that\u2019s helping us for sure,\u201d Kevin Patsel, regional vice president for Compass Northern California, said. Compass topped The Real Deal\u2019s Bay Area ranking this year by a wide margin, closing $27.7 billion in volume across 14,751 transactions.\nThis year\u2019s ranking of the Bay Area\u2019s top 20 brokerages offers a more robust analysis of dealmaking in the region. Unlike previous years that offered a gauge of business in\nSan Francisco County\n, this year\u2019s list is expanded to also include Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma counties.\nTRD reviewed information from the Multiple Listing Service on the buy- and sell-side between May 15, 2024, and May 15, 2025, to compile the list. Deals in excess of $100,000 across condo, co-op, single-family and townhouse properties are reflected here, minus off-market transactions.\nLos Altos is a good example of how tech\u2019s presence in the Bay Area and specifically Silicon Valley is helping push pricing. The Silicon Valley suburb has seen $10 million trades become normal, according to Chris Trapani, Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno CEO and co-founder.\n\u201cIs $10 [million] or $12 [million] the old $7 [million] or $8 [million] a few years back? Maybe,\u201d he said.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno rounded out the ranking\u2019s top five with 1,814 deals and $3.8 billion in volume.\n\u201cNvidia just crossed a $4 trillion market cap,\u201d Trapani said. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone airlifted another Apple computer and dropped it in Santa Clara County, which is in the middle of Silicon Valley, so that\u2019s a ton of capital that employees and shareholders of that company have.\u201d\nGrowth of artificial intelligence employers could also help boost business.\n\u201cAI is beginning to influence the city, not just the actual application of it but the real estate,\u201d Jeffrey Gibson, executive vice president and Northern California regional manager of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said. \u201cLots of new people getting degrees from all over the country, if they have any interest in this [AI], this is the place they are coming.\u201d\nSotheby\u2019s ranked No. 7 in TRD\u2019s list with 1,125 deals equating to $2.7 billion.\n\nFundamentals\nOverall, the market is moving, even if stubbornly high interest rates haven\u2019t dropped like agents hoped. Other factors are helping: Inventory is up in the Bay Area, though much of it is moving in less than 30 days and prices are not dropping, according to Coldwell Banker Realty Western Regional President Jennifer Lind.\nA swing to more favorable conditions for buyers is just not happening.\n\u201cBuyers have been waiting for a long time,\u201d Lind said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for interest rates to drop. They\u2019ve been waiting for prices to drop. But there hasn\u2019t been a material change.\u201d\nColdwell Banker Realty sits in the No. 2 spot on the ranking with 8,901 transactions amounting to $15.3 billion in volume.\nThe rest of the top five includes No. 3 Intero Real Estate Services with $7.8 billion in volume across 4,457 deals. They\u2019re followed by eXp Realty with $3.9 billion in volume across 3,758 transactions.\nThe brighter picture extends \u2014 finally \u2014 to\ndowntown San Francisco\n.\n\u201cDowntown is still lagging behind a bit, but it\u2019s much better than it was a year ago. A year ago it was completely dead,\u201d said Gibson, who pointed to return-to-office policies as the partial driver.\nThe state\u2019s aspirations to boost density might also prove favorable in the long run for the residential industry, Trapani said.\nA 10.5-acre property known as The Vineyard, running along Allendale and Chester avenues in Saratoga, closed for $30.6 million in June. The buyer was a consortium of executives who proposed a 231-unit residential project that would include 85 townhomes and 24 single-family homes. It\u2019s one of more than 20 builder\u2019s remedy projects in a queue with the city.\nThe project suggests what the market may look like if cities and communities follow state guidelines on building new housing.\n\u201cWe know we need more units,\u201d Trapani said. \u201cThe question is how are these cities going to accommodate allowing for that while also keeping the peace for the existing neighborhoods.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty, promised his team a cruise to Cabo if it reached more than a billion dollars in sales this year. Getting on the water seems unlikely, but it isn\u2019t all bad news.\nDeLeon, whose team topped The Real Deal\u2019s Bay Area brokers ranking from May 2024 to May 2025 with 149 transactions totaling $785 million, explained that the second half of last year was strong, and it was hard not to be optimistic about 2025 after the election, when President Donald Trump\u2019s policies appeared favorable for Silicon Valley\u2019s economy. That was before so-called Liberation Day.\n\u201cThe tariffs were announced, and things kind of slowed down,\u201d he said. After stocks plunged, the technology world really pulled back from real estate.\nNina Hatvany, who leads Team Hatvany at Compass, No. 7 onTRD\u2019s ranking with 77 transactions totaling nearly $252.1 million, shared a similar sentiment, that buyers were all worried about what tariffs would mean for them so they put off buying.\nHatvany said San Francisco was having a great spring selling season and that her team had a number of $10 million-plus sales \u2014 until tariffs were announced. \u201cWe suddenly had this complete pause, where all the buyers were like, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Hatvany said.\n\u201cSilicon Valley feels like it\u2019s back.\u201d\nKen DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty, on the mood a few months after Trump\u2019s tariff announcement\nIt was a much more difficult market than what some in the local industry had experienced, according to David Gunderman, cofounder of the Gunderman Group with Keller Williams, No. 8 on TRD\u2019s list with 145 transactions totaling $221.4 million.\n\u201cThe tariffs, the sort of lurching economy, the drops and recoveries in the stock market, I think it just made people more cautious than normal during that spring time,\u201d Gunderman said.\n\nThe situation has since calmed, and the year keeps getting better, DeLeon said. \u201cWe had a very successful June, where one week we sold $50 million worth of homes or so,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley feels like it\u2019s back.\u201d\nHatvany said the mood in San Francisco has begun to recover, and her team happens to be having an active July, which is unusual for her. DeLeon has noticed something unusual, too.\nThe $15 million to $30 million market is the strongest it has been in years \u2014 reminiscent of early pandemic life \u2014 but the $2 million to $4 million segment, which tends to be the most frenzied, has cooled off. The success in the upper echelon may have to do with luxury real estate becoming a safety net for the wealthy amid stock market and geopolitical volatility. Such buyers sometimes pay all cash so they\u2019re not worried about interest rates. At the lower range of luxury \u2014 sub-$4 million \u2014 uncertainty and tech layoffs are sources of weakness.\nDeLeon is hopeful for what the rest of the year will bring. Still, the cruise isn\u2019t likely. Hatvany finds the market is unpredictable, despite the recovery she noticed.\n\u201cSome properties are going immediately over asking, some are languishing,\u201d Hatvany said, and it\u2019s difficult to decipher why. Nonetheless, Hatvany thinks it\u2019ll be a good rest of the year for San Francisco sales. \u201cWe\u2019re always very stock market driven, and the stock market is back up,\u201d she said.\nBuyers generally have more confidence than they did in the spring, the agents explained. Still, brokers are adjusting. Some are spending more on promotions for listings and marketing more broadly and only taking on realistic sellers, rather than those who are overpricing by $1 million, according to DeLeon.\nBecause interest rates are still high, \u201cyou have to really be on your game,\u201d Gunderman said, unlike periods when the market is so hot all you have to do is put up a for-sale sign and people line up with offers. Because the cost of buying a home is so high, the buyer pool has shrunk, and buyers who are looking are especially critical. \u201cYour home has to be really well positioned and prepared for sale in a way that is going to capture [the buyer\u2019s] attention, or else you\u2019re really going to suffer in your outcome,\u201d he said.\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "San Francisco is poised to welcome a prestigious university to the city and it\u2019s not a new University of California outpost.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office is\nin talks with Vanderbilt University\nto open a satellite campus in downtown San Francisco. Details about the endeavor remain scant as discussions with the Nashville-based school are ongoing, though the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nconfirmed that Lurie has met twice with Vanderbilt leadership, as has\nNed Segal\n, the city\u2019s chief of housing and economic development.\nFormer Mayor London Breed announced\nintentions\nto build a historically Black college and university satellite campus in the city center as part of her\n30 x 30\ninitiative, designed to attract 30,000 students and residents to downtown by 2030. But the plans never came to fruition.\nLurie is hopeful, as Breed was about her plan, that Vanderbilt\u2019s expansion will revitalize the city\u2019s urban core.\n\u201cOur administration is working every day to create a clean, safe and thriving downtown \u2014 one that draws people, businesses and investments back to our city,\u201d Lurie told the Chronicle. \u201cWelcoming a world-class university like Vanderbilt to our city would bring new energy and foot traffic downtown, and we will continue working to make that happen.\u201d\nThe pending move follows a similar announcement last week in Los Angeles. The University of Michigan is\nplanning to set up its West Coast campus\nfor the Ross School of Business\u2019 Executive Master of Business Administration program at The Grand LA, a mixed-use complex in the heart of downtown.\nUnder the agreement, the Ross school will occupy 20,000 square feet on the third floor of the structure and build out classrooms, conference rooms, workspaces and indoor and outdoor event areas dedicated to the MBA program. For more than a decade, students flew into town once a month for a weekend of classes hosted at local hotels such as the Beverly Wilshire.\nBay Area hotel foreclosure sales top list of state\u2019s priciest transactions\nRumors of the Bay Area lodging market\u2019s death might not be greatly exaggerated.\nIn the year\u2019s first half, the average sales price per hotel room in Northern California was down 28 percent year-over-year to $129,500, according to a new report from Atlas Hospital Group cited by\nThe Mercury News\n. The region\u2019s hotel market has been\nplagued with foreclosures and loan defaults\nover the past year.\nTwo hotels in the Bay Area were the priciest hotel sales of the year so far, though both were foreclosure sales.\nEarlier this month, the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\nwent back to lender Invesco in a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million. In May, BrightSpire Capital\nbought back\nthe 541-room Signia by Hilton in downtown San Jose in a foreclosure that valued the property at $80 million. In third place in Atlas\u2019 report is another foreclosure in Southern California: The 397-room Line Hotel in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, with the foreclosure purchase by Corten Real Estate Partners placing its value at $68 million.\n\u201cThese three sales accounted for a total of [about $218.2] million of sales volume [in California], which is 15.7 percent of the entire dollar volume [of hotel sales] through the first six months of 2025,\u201d lan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, told The Mercury News.\nAI companies grab space in SF, Sunnyvale\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s foothold in the Bay Area continues to grow.\nIn San Francisco, AI-powered procurement platform Zip is moving into a 75,000-square-foot space at\n680 Folsom Street\nin South of Market\u2019s Yerba Buena neighborhood, which once housed Macys.com operations across 250,000 square feet. The lease more than quadruples the company\u2019s current footprint at 1 Sansome Street.\nFinancial services company Brex is also getting ahead of the AI curve as it doubles down on the technology in its products,\ngrabbing about 100,000 square feet\nat 270 Brannan Street after going headquarters-less and switching to a remote-first model in 2021. Similarly, software developer Postman is ramping up its AI-powered operations with the opening of a new 32,367-square-foot office in the Financial District.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Sunnyvale, AI-driven data and analytics giant Databricks leased 305,000 square feet across all seven floors at 200 Washington Avenue in downtown Sunnyvale, marking the company\u2019s third outpost in the Bay Area and 39th around the world. The company will be the first office tenant at the new Cityline Sunnyvale mixed-use complex.\nIn February, Databricks\ninked a roughly 150,000-square-foot lease\nat 1 Sansome Street in\nSan Francisco\nfor its new global headquarters. Databricks also has a 47,000-square-foot office at 351 East Evelyn Avenue in Mountain View, which it opened in 2020.\nApple continues Bay Area shopping spree\nApple has made its third nine-figure office purchase in the South Bay in the span of less than two months.\nThe iPhone giant is in contract to buy Kilroy Realty\u2019s Mathilda Campus in Sunnyvale for $365 million. It currently leases 581,429 square feet of the four-building, 663,000-square-foot complex. The deal, expected to close later in the third quarter, includes 505-599 North Mathilda Avenue and 605 West Maude Avenue.\nThe latest purchase follows last month\u2019s news that Apple bought 615 and 625 North Mathilda Avenue, located next door to the Mathilda Campus, for $350 million. It simultaneously dropped $166.9 million for the three-building, 220,000-square-foot Cupertino Gateway complex at 10200 North Tantau Avenue next to its Cupertino headquarters, which it was also leasing.\nApple previously bought a 10-building campus known as Apple Results Way, which it had been leasing since 2011, from Swift Realty Partners in 2023 for an undisclosed price. Later that year, the tech firm\nspent $70 million\non an office building at 10200 North De Anza Boulevard, down the street from a five-building complex that Apple\nbought in 2021 for $450 million\n.\nWells Fargo finds buyer for longtime SF HQ\nRedco is snapping up Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District.\nThe locally based real estate giant is under contract to acquire 420 Montgomery Street, months after a previous agreement with\nForge Development Partners\nnever came to fruition.\nForge planned to acquire the Montgomery Street building for about $135 per square foot, or $54 million, and convert the 13-story building into housing. Details around Redco\u2019s deal for the 409,000-square-foot tower, including price, were not disclosed, though it was reportedly more than what Forge would have paid.\nRedco is reportedly planning to keep the building for office use. Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters are currently spread across a T-shaped group of structures at the site with entrances on California, Leidesdorff and Sacramento streets.\nMosser offloads Nob Hill apartments after loan default\nSan Francisco real estate royalty Neveo Mosser\nsold\na Nob Hill apartment building after defaulting on a $14 million loan backed by JPMorgan that was tied to the property.\nA shell company linked to Cypress Capital Investments purchased the 75-unit mid-rise building at 1060 Bush Street for $16.5 million, or $220,000 per unit, earlier this month. The Mosser Companies CEO purchased the approximately 47,000-square-foot building in 2004 for $8.6 million.\nGarrett Brasseaux, founder of Cypress Capital Investments, is named in the deed, while Mosser is named as the grantor. The sale price was below the nearly $19.3 million asking price on the listing.\nSince its founding six decades ago, the Mosser real estate empire has acquired thousands of apartments in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles, growing its holdings to an estimated $1.5 billion in assets.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty is changing course on its planned development for San Francisco\u2019s former Flower Mart.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust was approved for 2 million square feet of offices and about 500,000 square feet of retail but is altering those plans, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. The project at 640 Brannan Street got the green light before the pandemic but has yet to break ground.\nKilroy has spent the past six months hammering out \u201ca significant redesign and reimagining\u201d of the Flower Mart project, CEO Angela Aman said Tuesday, per the Business Times. Details around the changes haven\u2019t been publicly disclosed, but Aman confirmed the company is looking into a \u201cbroader mix of uses\u201d than originally proposed.\nThe firm is also exploring the possibility of implementing a phased approach to the site\u2019s development rather than pursue the entire project at once, Aman said. The Flower Mart project is the largest in Kilroy\u2019s pipeline, according to the Business Times.\nWith San Francisco maintaining a\n35 percent office vacancy rate\n, Kilroy is one of several firms that are reconsidering office-heavy developments. The original Flower Mart plan called for about 2.5 million square feet of offices and retail in a traditionally more industrial-heavy area.\nThis spring, the city passed legislation eliminating a requirement that major developments in Central SoMa include a ratio of two-thirds commercial space to one-third residential space. That might lead Kilroy to get shovels in the ground as it could add residential units to the project or pivot to residential entirely.\n\nPlan revision was something Kilroy was hesitant to pursue, as Aman said in October 2024 that it didn\u2019t want to change its plans as a way of breaking ground sooner, according to the Business Times.\n\u201cThere are a number of plans that might be more actionable in the short term that would really impair the eventual, ultimate value and realization at Flower Mart,\u201d Aman said.\nNow, however, Kilroy is looking to \u201cmaintain a lot of the entitlements\u201d already in place at the site.\nIn the meantime, Kilroy has already delivered a\nnew flower mart location\nfor the vendors who previously operated out of the location at 6th and Brannan Streets.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tidewater Capital is adding to its Bay Area purchases with an apartment building near Oracle Park.\nThe San Francisco-based investor paid $37.8 million for the Arc Light Apartments at 21 Clarence Place, a block away from the San Francisco Giants\u2019 home stadium, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. The deal for the 94-unit apartment building comes to more than $400,000 per unit. Los Angeles-based Cityview and Newark, New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate sold the Arc Light property.\nApproximately 20 percent of the Arc Light Apartments are below market rate. The property also has two ground-floor commercial spaces and subterranean parking for residents.\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly clear when Cityview acquired the building, though it began investing in San Francisco multifamily properties a little over a decade ago, according to the Business Times. In 2018, Cityview\u2019s capital partner, the Los Angeles County Employee Retirement Fund, sold a 50 percent stake in a portfolio that included Arc Light and four other Bay Area apartment buildings to PGIM Real Estate for about $250 million.\n\nPrior to becoming apartments, the Arc Light building originally served as a power station for the California Electric Light Company, according to developer\nMartin Building Company\n. The developer\u2019s residential conversion was approved in 2006 and completed in 2012. That year, Cityview said it planned to acquire the newly converted apartment building for $90 million.\nTidewater has been snapping up properties across the Bay Area over the past two years, according to the Business Journal. In 2023, the firm raised more than $200 million in funds to purchase additional properties, making for a total of $1 billion in buying power for industrial, office and residential properties in the Bay Area, per founder Craig Young.\nIn March, the firm closed a $36 million purchase for 351 California Street, an 140,000-square-foot office building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District where the company is headquartered. Last year, Tidewater went on a\nshopping spree in Sunnyvale\n, buying two office campuses totaling 10 buildings in the South Bay city, spending $100.8 million on a seven-building tech campus and $65 million on a three-building office complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company took out a separate $26.5 million loan in 2020, and as of April of this year was reportedly in default for $29.9 million on all of its debts.\nMultifamily property owners in the East Bay have been navigating rough waters in recent months, as several properties have either gone back to lenders following loan defaults or sold for deep discounts compared to what their former owners paid.\n\nIn June, Oakland-based developer oWow returned its apartment building at 1919 Market Street in West Oakland to its lender, Boston-based UC Funds, in a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure deal.\nSignature Development\ngave back the 241-unit Orion Apartments at Brooklyn Basin in April to lender UBC Realty, also via a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nAt the top of the year, The Martin Group bought a 224-unit property at\n1889 Harrison Street\nin downtown Oakland for $61 million, or about half of its assessed value, the Business Times reported. In December, Three Steps Properties bought the 254-unit apartment building at 447 17th Street for $99 million, an approximately 53 percent drop from its assessed value.\nThe Academy West complex in Berkeley will be auctioned off Aug. 14 at noon at the Alameda County Courthouse.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Apple is taking another bite out of the South Bay with its third recent office purchase in the area.\nThe trillion-dollar company, headquartered in Cupertino, is in contract to buy Kilroy Realty\u2019s four-building Mathilda Campus in Sunnyvale, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nreported. The tech giant has purportedly agreed to buy 505-599 North Mathilda Avenue and\n605 West Maude Avenue\nfor $365 million.\nThe purchase would bring the buildings that Apple currently leases under the company\u2019s ownership. It leases 581,429 square feet of the 663,000-square-foot complex. The deal, expected to close later in the third quarter, works out to $550 per square foot.\nApple has been on a tear in the South Bay in recent months, dropping nearly $1 billion on office properties in three separate transactions.\nLast month, the company\nspent\n$350 million for 615 and\n625 North Mathilda Avenue\nin Sunnyvale, next door to the latest buildings purchased. That same week, it paid $166.9 million for the three-building, 220,000-square-foot\nCupertino Gateway complex\nat 10200 North Tantau Avenue next to its Cupertino headquarters. Like three of the four buildings at the Mathilda Campus, Apple was leasing those buildings.\n\nThe San Jose metro area had a 51.5 percent return-to-office rate as of July 16, close to a post-pandemic record, according to data provided to the Chronicle by security firm Kastle. Apple has seemingly been doubling down on in-person work in recent years with its continued investments in office properties in the area.\nIn early 2023, Apple bought a 10-building campus known as Apple Results Way from Swift Realty Partners for an undisclosed price. It had been leasing the property since 2011. Later that year, Apple\nspent $70 million\non an office building at 10200 North De Anza Boulevard.\nThe De Anza property is down the street from a five-building complex that Apple\nbought in 2021 for $450 million\n. It nabbed 10500 North De Anza Boulevard; 20400 Mariana Avenue; and 20605, 20665 and 20705 Valley Green Drive from affiliates controlled by developer Carl Berg.\nAt the end of the second quarter, Sunnyvale had an office vacancy rate of 18 percent, below Silicon Valley\u2019s overall rate of 20.7 percent, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield data cited by the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The school is purportedly working with Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office to make the dream a reality.\n\u201cWe recognize the long-term global leadership of San Francisco and its ever-growing potential, defined by a vibrant culture, dynamic innovation ecosystem and the talent drawn to its leading technology companies and top-caliber arts and cultural institutions,\u201d the spokesperson told the Chronicle. \u201cWe aim to create unique student experiences, fuel pathbreaking research and foster close connections to the ideas and companies that will lead the next generation of the nation\u2019s economy.\u201d\nDetails around the project, such as location, construction scope, academic programming and whether new student housing would be involved, remain light. Lurie is hopeful that Vanderbilt\u2019s entry into San Francisco\u2019s urban core could play a key part in the city\u2019s\npost-pandemic revitalization\n.\n\u201cOur administration is working every day to create a clean, safe and thriving downtown \u2014 one that draws people, businesses and investments back to our city,\u201d Lurie told the Chronicle. \u201cWelcoming a world-class university like Vanderbilt to our city would bring new energy and foot traffic downtown, and we will continue working to make that happen.\u201d\nWhile not much is known at the moment about the endeavor, the Chronicle confirmed that Lurie himself has met twice with Vanderbilt leadership, as has\nNed Segal\n, the city\u2019s chief of housing and economic development.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time a university satellite has been proposed for downtown San Francisco.\nLast year, former Mayor London Breed announced intentions to build a historically Black college and university satellite campus in the city center. It was part of Breed\u2019s 30 by 30 initiative, which aimed to attract 30,000 students and residents to downtown by 2030.\nIn 2023, Breed also asked the University of California Board of Regents to consider opening a new campus. That proposal\u2019s status remains unclear.\nThe University of California isn\u2019t opposed to growing its presence in the Bay Area, however; in May,\nUC agreed to acquire\nnearly 100 acres of land from Notre Dame de Namur University in Belmont with the possibility of future development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Garrett Brasseaux, Cypress Capital Investments founder and managing principal, is named in the deed, and Mosser is named as the grantor.\nMosser purchased the apartment building in 2004 for $8.6 million. He defaulted on a $14 million loan at the property in May, and a judge appointed the Bay Area Receivership Group\u2019s Gerard Keena as a receiver a month later, property records and court documents show.\nColliers\u2019 Brad Lagomarsino and Dustin Dolby represented Mosser in the acquisition of the roughly 47,000-square-foot multifamily property. The apartments sold below the apparent $19.25 million asking price seen on the listing. Lagomarsino and Dolby did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Mosser, Brasseaux or Keena.\n\nThe Mosser real estate empire has amassed $1.5 billion in assets and thousands of apartments in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles since its founding in 1955 by the late Charles William Mosser. Neveo Mosser was the chosen successor \u2014 but a\nbattle\namong the family played out in court after Mosser Companies defaulted on an $88 million loan tied to 12 apartment buildings in San Francisco last year.\n\u201cWe have our long-term, decades-old family portfolio, and then we have some buildings that we\u2019ve had with some of our investment partners,\u201d Mosser\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nlast year. \u201cFor the latter group, it\u2019s the culmination of what has happened over the three-year pandemic closure, plus the rise in interest rates, and if you had maturities that were coming up,\u201d he said, referring to the 12-multifamily property portfolio.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s up to the bank or the lender,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo they believe in San Francisco or are they watching Fox News continuously, or looking at the New York Post? So far for us, the portfolio has not been sold and we still continue to operate it. We\u2019re active and trying to go ahead and purchase that with another investor. So banks are really the key.\u201d\nThe San Francisco multifamily sector is showing signs of recovery and stability, a Colliers second-quarter report indicates, after dealing with increased vacancies and a \u201cdoom loop\u201d narrative.\n",

That office development will be placed on hold for the next 18 months at minimum.\nThe change in plans was partially made in response to ongoing troubles in San Francisco\u2019s commercial real estate market amid a slow post-pandemic recovery, Strada founding partner Jesse Blout told the Examiner.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty bullish on San Francisco\u2019s residential market,\u201d Blout said. \u201cWe have conviction that the market is zooming back.\u201d\n\nThe proposed residential buildings would have nearly 200 affordable units set aside for low-income renters as well as 13,000 square feet of\nground-floor retail\n.

Since the building opened in May, half of the 501 units have already been leased.\n\u201cIn that timeframe, [that\u2019s] really unprecedented,\u201d Blout said. Coupled with increasing rental prices, developers like Strada might have more cash on hand to build new housing projects. \u201cIt\u2019s caught even us off guard just how quickly the market has rebounded,\u201d Blout said.\nStrada and the Port will spend the next 18 months reviewing the Piers 30 through 32 office project and outline a plan to make it financially feasible. The company is \u201cvery invested in finding the solution\u201d to allow the offices to move forward, Blout said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

International Bank of Commerce provided the loan.\nThe 38-story, 90-unit condo project will be located at 102 Asbury Street in Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood. The loan amounts to $2.8 million per unit.\nThe development will feature seven penthouses; its amenities include wellness offerings like cold plunges, saunas, steam rooms, a gym, pool and meditation garden, as well as a 20th-floor private dining room.\nResidents will get St. Regis valet and butler service.\nPrices start at $3 million. Satya plans to start construction in the fourth quarter and complete the project by the fourth quarter of 2027. Douglas Elliman is marketing the condos.\nContracts are in place for about 15 of the units, said Satya CEO Sunny Bathija. The developer increased the size of the project earlier this year when there was a swell of buyer interest.\nThe buyer profile ranges, Bathija said. Some are empty nesters who \u201cwant a lock-and-leave experience.\u201d Bathija said he recently had lunch with a buyer who explained he was drawn to the condo because he hadn\u2019t been upstairs at his 6,000-square-foot house in years.\n\u201cA lot of empty-nesters have made enough money and they have second and third homes. They don\u2019t want to deal with the maintenance of houses and lawns,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple buyers are folks who work in the energy industry and frequently travel internationally.\nThe\nmarket for luxury condos\nis less developed in Houston, Dallas and Austin than peer cities like Miami, New York and Chicago. Luxury buyers in Texas have long preferred to spread out.\n\u201cSingle-family living has been the core thing for Texans for a long, long time,\u201d Bathija said.\nThe other explanation for the market\u2019s newness is that it\u2019s harder to get condo projects financed here. Texas is one of about a dozen states that does not allow developers to use deposits from condo pre-sales on construction.\nDevelopers are finding ways around the financing obstacles. For example, when developing the Hawthorne in Tanglewood, Pelican Builders and Ember Group refinanced their debt on the project with a $111 million loan that leveraged the unsold inventory as collateral for the loan.\nThere was a push this past legislative session to change the law, but it wasn\u2019t successful. Bathija is optimistic it\u2019ll move forward in the next few years.\nDespite the financing challenges, new condo projects are getting built and performing well, proving there\u2019s demand for the product. Also in River Oaks, Randall Davis Company\u2019s\nLondon House\nopened earlier this year with all but two units pre-sold.\nBathija has been building condo projects in Houston for about a decade. In that time, he\u2019s seen Houstonians learn they like condo living and spread the word.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that no one else can do this, but we are raising the bar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want Texas to have something more, and I think they deserve it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Onyx Partners is betting big on a classic American retailer\u2019s slow reinvention.\nThe Lakewood, New Jersey\u2013based commercial real estate and private equity firm agreed to acquire 119 JCPenney store properties for $947 million in cash, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The sale is expected to close Sept. 8 and marks one of the largest retail real estate portfolio deals in recent years.\nThe price amounts to nearly $8 million per store. Old-school JCPenney stores spanned about 110,000 square feet, but the retailer has trended toward 70,000 to 90,000 square feet in recent years, according to the Motley Fool.\nThe properties span more than 30 states, including locations in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. The seller is Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust, a special-purpose vehicle created during JCPenney\u2019s 2020 bankruptcy to hold its real estate. That trust has acted as landlord for the retailer since its restructuring.\nAll stores in the deal will remain open under their existing operations. The retailer is now part of Catalyst Brands, the holding company formed earlier this year by the merger of JCPenney with Sparc Group. The entity also controls A\u00e9ropostale, Brooks Brothers, Eddie Bauer, Lucky Brand and Nautica.\n\nThe move signals ongoing efforts to reset JCPenney\u2019s financial structure and unlock long-term value from its real estate. Since its bankruptcy filing, the Plano-based retailer has closed more than 150 stores, offloaded distribution centers and pared down corporate staff. The company said in February it would operate just under 650 stores nationwide by mid-2025. The trust\u2019s sale to Onyx gives JCPenney a more stable long-term leasing arrangement, while delivering a windfall to certificate holders in the trust.\nThe deal also reflects renewed interest from institutional investors in stabilized retail assets. Onyx Partners has been quietly assembling retail-heavy portfolios and could use the acquisition as a platform for further aggregation or redevelopment.\nThe property sale could mark a turning point in JCPenney\u2019s long climb back from near collapse, even if the company\u2019s retail future is uncertain.\nThe retailer is pushing a brand refresh. Its \u201cYes, JCPenney\u201d campaign has focused on perception shifts and promotions, which it says has driven a 22 percent year-over-year increase in brand search demand and a 6 percent rise in foot traffic. The chain recently reported its strongest performance in home goods and fine jewelry.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The price amounts to $545 per square foot.\nThe 34-acre property, at 23501 Cinco Ranch Boulevard in Katy, is about 3 miles south of Interstate 10 in the Cinco Ranch master-planned community.\nAnchored by Trader Joe\u2019s, its tenant roster includes Athleta, Lululemon, Sephora, Warby Parker, Lovesac, a small-format Ikea and restaurants such as Cava, Grimaldi\u2019s and Ambriza. The shopping center attracts more than 5 million visits annually, according to Brixmor.\nThe firm plans to capture upside as leases with below-market rents expire, said Mark Horgan, Brixmor\u2019s executive vice president and chief investment officer.\n\nThe shopping center was developed by Houston-based Vista Equities Group, with Denver\u2019s Amstar Group as equity partner. It opened in 2007 and sold a decade later to PGIM Real Estate, which brought in Poag Shopping Centers to manage and lease the property. PGIM tapped Trademark Property Company last year to handle leasing.\nBrixmor already owns 30 other assets in the Houston area, which is its third-largest market. Those include the Whole Foods\u2013anchored West U Marketplace and Lake Pointe Village in Sugar Land. The firm owns over 360 centers nationwide and closed $293 million in acquisitions last year while shedding more than $200 million in assets.\nThe Katy acquisition stands out for its price as much as its alignment with consumer trends. Open-air centers with strong dining and lifestyle offerings outperform traditional malls in the state\u2019s main metros, especially in high-income suburbs like Katy.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

It\u2019s a fixed-rate, interest-only loan with a 35-year amortization schedule. The debt amounts to $377,000 per unit.\nHines, in partnership with Chicago-based Diversified Real Estate Capital, delivered the Victor in 2021. The 40-story tower features 18 penthouse apartments.\nIn terms of amenities, the Victor has a 38th-floor amenity deck, ninth-floor pool, golf simulator, 24-hour valet parking, coworking space and a gym. When the building opened, prices at units in the tower ranged from $1,970 to $16,300 per month.\nIt\u2019s located near the Katy Trail and Klyde Warren Park, offering a rare level of walkability for Dallas apartments. It also offers proximity to American Airlines Center, home to the Dallas Stars and Mavericks.\n\nThe financing highlights Uptown as a destination for luxury living in Dallas.\nSome of the Metroplex\u2019s most anticipated developments are being built in the neighborhoods that make up Uptown, like Victory Park, Knox-Henderson and Turtle Creek. For example, the 17-story Rosewood Residences is bringing about 33 condos to Turtle Creek, and an Auberge hotel that\u2019s part of the Knox Street Development will also offer luxury condos.\nMeanwhile, the Dallas multifamily market is plagued with oversupply after a historic number of apartment units were delivered last year. As a result, occupancy levels and rental rates have fallen. Though the pipeline has contracted, 25,000 units are expected to be delivered this year, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.\nMidway through the year, rent was down 2 percent since this time last year. Class A properties have weathered the market better, with rent virtually unchanged in the last 12 months for high-end multifamily properties like the Victor.\n",

        "content": "Ray Johnston needed 26 handshakes.\nThe former Dallas Maverick and current country singer who entered real estate as a side hustle scored some prime land right outside Princeton, Texas, just before it came to be recognized as the\nfastest-growing city in the country\n. To sell to a homebuilder and turn a pro-grade profit on the first major deal of his real estate career, all Johnston needed was for neighboring property owners to approve easements for sewer lines.\nThat meant persuading 26 homeowners, many of whom had moved to Princeton precisely to avoid subdivisions, to let Johnston build.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Johnston shrugged, \u201cit\u2019d be somebody else.\u201d\nNorth Texas hay fields have been turning into neighborhoods for decades as Dallas grew north. Princeton, 45 minutes from Dallas in Collin County, is just the latest to benefit, or suffer, depending on who you are. Brokers and developers are mining in a gold rush, local business owners are enjoying a quickening marketplace and North Texans are finding quieter, more affordable neighborhoods with a closer drive to work in Frisco, Plano and Irving. On the other hand are the old guard, the people who\u2019ll say you used to see the Milky Way over Lake Lavon (now sentried by signs that say \u201cNo Fishing From Bridge\u201d) and the retirees in double-wides on two acres. Unaffected by the city\u2019s restrictions, but also lacking city infrastructure, their neck of the woods is the ripest for development, but it\u2019s work to get the land ready.\nEnter Johnston, a former loan officer and NBA athlete whose hard-won victory over leukemia and second life as a country singer have inspired several\nprofiles\nand a documentary funded by his old boss, Mark Cuban. Johnston\u2019s aw-shucksness can make it seem like he stumbled into the Princeton deal.\nTrue, besides a local\u2019s instinct, neither he nor the partners in his business, No Bad Days LLC, specifically foresaw that Princeton\u2019s population would double to 37,000 in the four years following his 2021 purchase of 138 acres, or that the local government would scramble to slow things down with a\ntemporary moratorium\non residential construction inside city limits that will have lasted more than a year when it expires in November.\nThough his scope is tiny compared to many of the Metroplex\u2019s projects, Johnston, for both his good timing and his understanding of the moment, carries the story of Princeton and places like it as much as anyone. Everyone knew white-collar Dallasites wanted bigger yards and smaller schools, but not everybody predicted quite how far they\u2019d be willing to stretch for them. Those that saw it are getting a payoff \u2014 and a lesson in Texas-sized growing pains.\n\u201cI\u2019m all in on DFW growing,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe only way this loses is if all of a sudden people start leaving Texas. Doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s happening anytime soon.\u201d\n(To be sure, population growth has slowed, and residential prices in some Dallas suburbs have been correcting, even as homebuilders and investors scoop up more deals.)\nSales prices aren\u2019t available in Texas property records and Johnston won\u2019t disclose how much he paid. But D.R. Horton paid about $70,000 per acre for unentitled land that became the Crossmill subdivision about five miles north of Johnston\u2019s tract, according to a company filing.\nG\nold medal growth\nThe population trend line of the\nDallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area\nhasn\u2019t taken a dent since the 1970s. The 2020 U.S. Census counted 7.6 million in the Metroplex; that went to 8.3 million in 2024 estimates. Behind the steady rise of the population, each new town it absorbs experiences a spike that, in Princeton\u2019s case, can get steep. Princeton cracked 5,000 residents for the first time between the 2000 and 2010 Census; it surpassed 10,000 by 2017. The Census estimated that Princeton had hit 37,000 people in July 2024.\nConstruction is everywhere, and rush hour traffic crawls. Straddling FM 3286, the most direct road to Dallas from Johnston\u2019s purchase, is a bait shop-feed store-gas station on one side and on the other, a fresh concrete pad patrolled by Caterpillar machines. (Caterpillar moved its\nheadquarters\nto Irving in 2022.) Construction crews have pitted all four corners of the intersection of FM 982 and Highway 380, one of the many traffic lights in a town that famously had but two in 2013.\nPrinceton\u2019s surge has made it a symbol of Texas\u2019 success but local reticence brought the attention of the\nstate legislature\n.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me, it\u2019d be somebody else.\u201d\nRay Johnston on the inevitability of development\nIts city council voted for the moratorium in September of 2024, to give the city time to pave roads and lay pipe. Infrastructure aside, a feud between local and state government is smoldering. State House and Senate leaders made it a priority to add affordable housing this year, and they aim to find it behind local red tape. Dealing a blow to those who\u2019d expand more gradually, new state laws take effect this year that trim municipal authority over neighborhood density, residential conversions and building moratoriums. Pressing pause now requires notices by mail and newspaper, two public hearings at least 30 days apart and a supermajority vote to pass. Moratoriums automatically expire after 90 days, and the city can only extend them to 180.\nAt a late June meeting of the Princeton council, with a moratorium extension on the agenda (it passed), resentment of the new regime seeped in.\nOne councilmember asked Assistant City Attorney Grant Lowry if there was a way to get an exemption to the new rule in case they wanted to extend again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my understanding,\u201d Lowry said, with a certain grimness. \u201cThe state is notorious for being developer-friendly and anti-municipality.\u201d\nThe development lockdown in Princeton\u2019s city limits has made county land all the more desirable. The problem is that it comes without infrastructure. Owners looking to sell to homebuilders must either assume the cost of bringing in roads, water and sewer lines, which means procuring easements from neighbors, or cut their asking price to pass this cost to the buyer. In a community with growing pains, the price of land and easements responds not only to demand but also to who\u2019s buying \u2014 a big homebuilding company or a friendly country singer.\nScouting for passive income\nAs Johnston tells his story over burgers at Park House, a club in Highland Park, it becomes clear that his Princeton play wasn\u2019t dumb luck. Between music gigs at billionaire Ray Hunt\u2019s ranch, chance friendships with the Scovells, hangouts with Cuban and apparently regular hunting trips with a rotating cast of ranch brokers, Johnston has spent years making connections with Dallas\u2019 most eminent players. He\u2019s just now leveraging them.\nJohnston lays out maps of his Princeton purchase next to our fries. A Sixpence None the Richer song is playing, and when it gets around to the chorus, Johnston slips into the harmony.\nLooking for a passive income source to support his musical career, Johnston acquired the land in 2021, he explained. Initially, he was scouting a good site for a boat storage facility on Lake Lavon after enjoying some success with a similar project near Tyler.\n\u201cI just wanted to invest in something that was passive, that could be somewhat recession-proof, because I was touring along with the band and I didn\u2019t have time to be there,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nThe land he bought comprises two tracts; a Collin County native named Willis Housewright owned one, and his sister-in-law Flo owned the other. Flo, who lives in Oklahoma, said Ray\u2019s personal touch convinced her and Willis to accept his offer.\n\u201cWe had been approached several times about selling, but Ray and several others at the same time presented us with different offers, and we decided to go with Ray and his partner at that time. We just had a good feeling about what they presented to us. And certainly financially, we had some demands that they readily accepted. Anyway,\u201d Flo said, \u201cit went very smooth. \u2026 He\u2019s an unusual person, business-wise, as well as just being a very kind, giving person.\u201d\nOf course, as Johnston remembers, the obvious question eventually occurred to Flo during their three-year correspondence: Why not call up Lennar?\n\u201cShe asked us, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t we just sell to the end seller?\u2019\u201d Ray recalls. He told her, \u201c\u2018That makes sense. But if you do that, you\u2019re going to do a lot of work to your land, like get water easements to bring water to your land; get sewer easements to bring sewer to your land. We\u2019re good at that, so that\u2019s why we want to pay you this.\u2019 And it was a lot of work to get easements to that land.\u201d\nNorth Texas hay fields have been turning into neighborhoods for decades as Dallas grew north. Princeton is just the latest to benefit, or suffer, depending on who you are.\nThat\u2019s an understatement, according to his business partners. Brant Landry and Clint Riley, partners at the Dallas firm Reserve Capital Partners, also have a stake in No Bad Days. Each met Johnston about a decade ago on a different hunting trip. There\u2019s a reason why some homebuilders avoid the entitlement process altogether, preferring to purchase land ready to build, they pointed out.\nClayton Snodgrass, principal at Bluebonnet Partners, and son-in-law of Celina magnate Rex Glendenning, had more of a nose for Princeton\u2019s potential than either Johnson, Landry or Riley. He\u2019s the one who convinced Johnston \u2014 the would-be passive investor \u2014 that the hustle would be worth it, seeing the potential to get ahead of the major homebuilders and increase the profit when he sold.\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Look, if you want to move this thing along as far as possible, you\u2019re gonna have to go door to door.\u2019 He did the knocking on doors and kissing babies,\u201d Snodgrass said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most easements that I\u2019ve seen a guy that\u2019s not a professional easement procurer go get,\u201d Riley added.\nAt each of the 26 houses, Johnston showed up with a gift certificate to a nearby store or restaurant, a business card shaped like a guitar pick, and occasionally his girlfriend.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re with a girlfriend, it\u2019s a little less sales, more civilized,\u201d he said.\nI\nSO: Water, wastewater\na\nnd police\nDallas isn\u2019t only swelling north. There\u2019s been healthy development south of the city for some time. Ellis County towns like Midlothian and Waxahachie have attracted the attention of players as big as Jerry Jones, Walton Global, RREAF Holdings and Cawley Partners.\nEven so, southern areas are the underdog, with low-performing school districts that belt the city to the south. Meanwhile, the northward expansion keeps going, the Dallas North Tollway reaching toward Oklahoma. Companies that relocate to the Metroplex overwhelmingly prefer the northern neighborhoods, with Toyota, KFC and State Farm in Plano, TIAA and McAfee in Frisco, Charles Schwab in Westlake and Raytheon in McKinney.\nIt\u2019s less sure which rural spot will become the next Princeton. Plenty of Texas cities have scrambled to offer tax benefits for commercial development in the hopes that employees will follow, even if they also encounter the typical growing pains.\nBut the issue of local control is a definitive wedge in Texas government, and municipal leaders chafe at statewide guardrails on their authority.\nJohnston needed his sewer easements, and as the Princeton moratorium winds toward its final deadline, the city is adjusting to the widening compass of Dallas\u2019 sprawl by making headway on an improved wastewater system and building a 3 million gallon storage tank. The police force is hiring, and new roads should redistribute traffic.\n\u201cThe city is making some progress,\u201d Lowry, the Princeton attorney, told the council in late June.\nT\nhe last 60 acres\nJohnston kept pursuing the 26 neighbors. After each easement chat, he\u2019d send a personalized gift basket, and eventually, everyone said yes. Growth might have been inevitable, but the landowners just outside Princeton didn\u2019t prefer someone else, it turned out. He got the easements he needed, and he\u2019s now sold two-thirds of the land.\nDollar Tree picked up 1.2 acres and built a store in February at the T-intersection on FM 982. Lennar\nbought\n32 acres last December and 43 this March. Another 16 acres are under contract now with an apartment development company. Johnston won\u2019t say how much he got for it.\nToday, the land is graded and plumbed for Lennar\u2019s upcoming subdivision. After a rain, contractors\u2019 bootprints overlapped with deer tracks in the mud. Decorative limestone pillars, the only structures except the new Dollar Tree, mark what will become the entrances to the development. For now, the view toward the lake is lush; it won\u2019t look the same when development starts.\nBut if it hadn\u2019t been Johnston, it would probably be somebody else \u2014 this is his refrain.\n\u201cMuch like music,\u201d Ray says, \u201cit was just timing.\u201d\nHe puts the conclusion less lyrically in the biography of his LinkedIn profile, which describes the land \u2014 the deals he\u2019s made and what\u2019s left to sell.\n\u201cSewer,\u201d his write-up ends, \u201carrives Dec \u201925.\u201d",

        "content": "Today, it\u2019s a broad expanse of prairie in the North Dallas growth path. But on this land, Imran Chaudhary wants to build a community he could move his parents to.\nThat\u2019s half the reason he gives for devising a plan to build a 400-acre city in Collin County (north of Dallas) around a mosque. By including single-family homes, apartments, schools and senior living facilities, the community would make multigenerational living possible in a region whose rapacious growth is putting one of its primary selling points \u2014 housing affordability \u2014 more and more out of reach.\nBack in Pakistan, where Chaudhary lived until age 19, his grandparents lived in his family home. EPIC City, named for the East Plano Islamic Center, could offer Muslim families in North Texas the opportunity to grow up like he did.\n\u201cIf something happens, you can go and take care of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we found that gap in the community that we live in \u2026 That was a charm that a lot of people bought into.\u201d\nThe other half of Chaudhary\u2019s reasoning for wanting to build EPIC City is practical. The project could generate income to sustain the mosque anchoring the community.\nThe idea reflects the rising prominence of North Texas\u2019 Muslim population to the extent that Dallas earned the moniker \u201cMedina of America\u201d after the Saudi Arabian city that\u2019s central to the Muslim faith.\nHowever, since news of the project spread, EPIC City has faced the scrutiny of local, state and federal officials, with Gov. Greg Abbott (who recently signed a law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments) taking notice and\ninitiating\na full court press against the development.\nAbbott has also taken to X to peddle claims that EPIC City\nwill enact Sharia law\n; that particular post was a retweet from Amy Mekelburg, an influencer and self-described \u201ccritic of Islam\u201d who has claimed the leaders of EPIC City are \u201cUsing Texas as the Blueprint for Sharia Domination.\u201d\n\u201cNone of that is true,\u201d Chaudhary said.\nPutting the outcry aside, Chaudhary\u2019s pursuit of the project comes as unaffordable housing and the isolation of suburban life have pushed religious leaders to propose a return to traditional European city design, where a church anchors the town.\nFrom Detroit to Northern Virginia to Naples, Florida, church leaders have entertained (to varying levels of success) the prospect of building towns around religious institutions, including churches and universities.\nIn light of this growing trend, the controversy surrounding EPIC City poses the question: Who\u2019s allowed to build a community?\nT\nhe promise\nThe opening of a YouTube video titled \u201cWelcome to EPIC City\u201d pans through the cloudy heavens until a mosque comes into view under the blazing Texas sun.\n\u201cA meticulously designed community that brings Islam to the forefront,\u201d the narrator says.\nBacklash against the community came in the form of accusations of discrimination. Since the video was posted in April 2024, leaders have backpedaled on the language they use to describe the project.\nAn earlier version of EPIC City\u2019s website describes it as \u201ca vibrant and inclusive community that serves the evolving needs of the Muslim community.\u201d The language has since been updated to describe the project as \u201ca vibrant, multigenerational and inclusive master planned community.\u201d\nAs Chaudhary and his partners navigate the public relations storm that EPIC has stirred, they\u2019re also operating as the city\u2019s developer.\nCommunity Capital Partners is the project\u2019s development entity, and it\u2019s led by Chaudhary and fellow directors Sarfraz Ahmad and Naveed Siddiqui. Ahmad, a custom homebuilder, is the one with real estate experience.\nCommunity Capital Partners purchased the land for EPIC City in 2024.\nThe property is a swath of unincorporated area within Collin and Hunt counties, meaning that the developer will be required to get county approval for the development. The counties regulate such matters as platting and infrastructure, but they don\u2019t regulate land use or density.\nCommunity Capital Partners is now in the fundraising stage, raising capital by selling about 1,000 shares of the company for $80,000 each. Purchasing a share allows the investor to reserve a lot at EPIC City and provides a 15 percent discount on the land. The only requirement is that shareholders must be accredited investors. So far, the entity has sold about 500 shares, which works out to $40 million.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that whatever we do, we do it right with the proper legal paperwork,\u201d Chaudhary said.\nDespite his best efforts, the financing structure they\u2019re using was the target of\na new law\npassed this legislative session.\nRepublican state Rep. Candy Noble of Allen, Texas, sponsored House Bill 4211. It requires that a housing development owned by a business entity must disclose to investors that they are purchasing shares of the company, not property.\nAbbott characterized HB 4211 as a law that would \u201ccrack down\u201d on communities like EPIC City.\nDespite pointing to investigations into the project by multiple state agencies (the Texas Workforce Commission, the Texas State Securities Board, the Texas Funeral Services Commission and the Department of Public Safety), Abbott has never directly said how EPIC City could be breaking the law.\nB\nack to basics\nArchitect Erik Bootsma became interested in the idea of traditional living when he was an undergraduate student at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California.\nIt\u2019s where he became a Catholic, got interested in traditional architecture and met people he counts among his dearest friends decades later.\nUnder the mentorship of Philip Bess at Notre Dame\u2019s School of Architecture and Milton Grenfell at Grenfell\u2019s D.C. architecture firm, Bootsma studied the urban planning of yore, holding up the church-anchored European village as a model for living well.\nThe impulse to self-associate is natural, Bootsma said, pointing to the ethnic enclaves created by immigrants in cities across the country throughout American history.\nHe recalls visiting Crown Heights, Brooklyn, on the Sabbath. He remembers seeing Jewish folks walking to the synagogue and socializing on neighbors\u2019 porches. He holds it up as one of his favorite places.\n\u201cIs it insular? Maybe. But it\u2019s also an actual, real community,\u201d he said.\nBootsma acknowledges that villages built around places of worship could err on the side of being overly homogeneous, and he noted the need for both balance and openness to life outside.\nIn 2008, Bootsma drew up a master plan for St. John the Beloved, a Catholic church in Northern Virginia, to transform the swath of empty land it owned into a village. Housing costs were on the rise, and building homes around the church would allow parishioners to live onsite.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got retirees who come to daily mass,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if they would come to daily mass by walking instead of driving?\u201d On the flip side, \u201ca young family would be able to afford an apartment or a small house there.\u201d\nMore recently, Bootsma has been working on a similar plan with St. Joseph Shrine in Detroit, where most parishioners commute to church. Building housing would allow them to be together more than an hour a week.\nNeither project has come to fruition. There\u2019s not really a template to work from, and, as a result, it\u2019s been challenging to square the financing details. But Bootsma is confident that someday some project will, and he\u2019s noticed a growing interest in these kinds of intentional communities.\n\n\u201cI think people are starting to see that the promise of the suburban experience is not what it was chalked up to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are finding that they are scattered and atomized. People have fewer and fewer friends.\u201d\nBootsma isn\u2019t the only one interested in working out the kinks. A movement called YIGBY, Yes in God\u2019s Backyard, has fomented in the last few years with the goal of creating a path for land-rich religious institutions to turn their valuable real estate into housing.\nA\nve Maria\nNo one\u2019s been more successful at building something like what Bootsma describes than Tom Monaghan, the billionaire founder of Domino\u2019s Pizza.\nIn search of a home for a Catholic university, he partnered with developer Barron Collier, which was sitting on a piece of undeveloped land 40 miles south of Naples, Florida.\nAve Maria was founded in 2005. Monaghan handled the university and the church. Collier handled the commercial development.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been basically in charge of this project from day one, and I\u2019m Episcopalian,\u201d said Blake Gable, CEO of Barron Collier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not some sort of dogmatic Catholicism thing.\u201d\nGable said he dealt with the typical NIMBY ilk in pursuing the project, but the prospect of putting a university in someone\u2019s backyard was \u201ckind of hard to complain about.\u201d\nBarron Collier secured about 80 permits at the county, state and federal levels before putting a shovel in the ground, he said. To raise funds for the project, Collier issued bonds and took out traditional loans.\nIt took five years, from the birth of the partnership to the day the first person moved into town.\nTwenty years into the development, it\u2019s halfway done and home to 11,000 people. There are walking trails, a water park, retail, health care, a manufacturing plant, schools, restaurants and even a Baptist Church.\n\u201cI truly believe that we have created a foundation that has all the things necessary,\u201d Gable said. \u201cWhatever happens from here on out, up to people who live there.\u201d\nCarole Carpenter, a broker with John R. Wood Properties who works in Ave Maria, described the makeup of the community as \u201c50 percent Catholic. The rest came because they want to play golf.\u201d\nThe Catholic part isn\u2019t something she discusses with prospective buyers unless they ask, Carpenter said.\nBut when they do ask, she has some incredible stories to tell them about how she moved to Florida to help start the university. For instance, she shares that the first house she sold in Ave Maria was the church\u2019s tabernacle \u2014 a $500,000 gift from a stranger who approached Carpenter wanting to make a donation in honor of her husband.\n\u201cThe town speaks for itself,\u201d she said. It certainly attracts all kinds of people, but, \u201cyou can\u2019t go into town without seeing this huge church.\u201d\n9\n0 miles yonder\nEPIC City\u2019s controversial arc draws a stark contrast to plans for a Catholic community just 90 miles away in Tyler, Texas.\nVeritatis Splendor, named for an encyclical from Pope John Paul II and that translates to \u201cthe splendor of truth,\u201d refers to a project born around 2021 that aims to \u201cbuild a flourishing community of Catholics\u201d in East Texas.\nThe project stalled with about 20 houses built after what current resident Stephen Handley, Veritatis Splendor CEO, aptly summed up as \u201cdrama.\u201d Pope Francis removed Tyler Bishop Joseph Strickland, a major proponent of the project, from his post. In addition, news broke of an affair between Kari Beckman, who was on Veritatis Splendor\u2019s board of directors, and Texas Right to Life\u2019s Jim Graham.\nAfter moving to the community in 2023, Handley teamed up with his neighbors to get the vision back on track with a grassroots push.\nHandley, who runs a software company, is approaching the project like a start-up. He\u2019s got the seed money for the first phase, which involves looking deeply into what\u2019s possible for the community in terms of infrastructure and utilities.\nBut he dreams big.\nVeritatis Splendor has 377 acres of developable land on which Handley and his neighbors would like to see a church, more single-family homes and a commercial district.\nHandley estimates that the community could cost $100 million. He\u2019s exploring different options for raising the money, he said, including selling shares of a company, selling bonds or taking out debt securities.\nIn comparison to Ave Maria, Veritatis Splendor is and will be a lot smaller, Handley said. The rural setting makes it possible for lots to span multiple acres. The community is unique in that there\u2019s a strong agricultural element, including a vast blueberry farm. One of Veritatis Splendor\u2019s pillars is education, and most residents choose to homeschool their kids.\n\u201cDay to day, it probably feels more like your traditional suburb,\u201d Handley said about Ave Maria. \u201cIn Veritatis Splendor, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever take on a suburbia feel.\u201d\nThe group spearheading the revival of the community has consulted attorneys about the process, including ensuring they don\u2019t run afoul of Fair Housing laws. No one is excluded, Handley said. But, the community\u2019s traditions, such as a nightly rosary walk, communicate the values of the people who live there.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being more explicit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018These are our values,\u2019 and we\u2019re not shying away from it \u2026 There\u2019s other reasons people are attracted to a community like ours, but we\u2019re putting our faith as that first reason.\u201d\nThe explicit mentions of Catholicism on the part of the community\u2019s leadership haven\u2019t drawn the same accusations of discrimination as EPIC City.\nThe Real Deal requested information related to investigations into either community from the entities Abbott mentioned. In the case of EPIC City, the entities claimed the documents were confidential. There were no documents related to investigations into Veritatis Splendor.\nS\nalvation?\nCommunity Capital Partners has yet to submit any plans for approval to Hunt or Collin county, but that could change soon.\nDavid Kalhoefer, an engineer hired by the developer, told Collin County commissioners in March that the group is in the process of conducting water, flood and traffic studies. The company plans to submit plans by the end of the year, Kalhoefer said.\nThe same meeting stretched to four and a half hours long; the room was packed with public commenters who showed up to register their opposition to the community, calling Islam a religion that \u201callows abuse to women\u201d and claiming that EPIC City would be the site of \u201chonor killings, stonings.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Community Capital Partners continues to fight accusations of discrimination from Texas leaders. So far, it\u2019s winning.\nIn early April, the group\nhired\nDan Cogdell, a well-known attorney who led the successful defense of Ken Paxton\u2019s impeachment trial, to respond to the investigations. Cogdell came out swinging, accusing Abbott of \u201cgubernatorial hate speech.\u201d\nAfter opening an inquiry on May 9, the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its investigation into EPIC City in a letter on June 13.",

        "content": "Texas\u2019 luxury highrise\ncondo market\nis not just a dream for developers. Institutional capital is buying in, too.\nHouston-based Satya Inc. landed a\n$255\u202fmillion construction loan\nfrom International Bank of Commerce to fund the state\u2019s first purely residential St.\u202fRegis Residences development. The debt translates to roughly $2.8\u202fmillion per unit.\nThe 38-story tower will rise at 102\u202f Asbury Street in the upscale River Oaks area and feature seven penthouses and 90 residences, with prices starting at $3\u202fmillion. The developer added another floor after bids reserving about 40\u202fpercent of the units piled in earlier this year.\nSpanning more than 40,000\u202fsquare feet, the amenities lineup includes a 26th-floor sky terrace with private dining and a cognac bar, wellness features such as cold plunges and saunas, a pet spa, yoga studios, co\u2011working spaces and full butler and valet service via Marriott\u2019s St.\u202fRegis brand.\nConstruction is slated to begin in the fourth quarter and wrap up at the end of 2027. Douglas Elliman is handling marketing and sales.\nSpeaking of capital, Hines secured\n$130 million in refinancing\nfrom Fannie Mae for the Victor, a 344-unit apartment tower at 3039 Nowitzki Way in Dallas. The financing highlights Uptown as a destination for luxury highrise living. It\u2019s located near the Katy Trail, Klyde Warren Park, the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, and the site where Goldman Sachs is building a $500 million office campus.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\nA rare public sale price was reported for a head-turning retail transaction. New York-based REIT Brixmor Property Group paid\n$223 million for LaCenterra at Cinco Ranch\n, at 23501 Cinco Ranch Boulevard in the Houston suburb Katy. The price amounted to $545 per square foot for the 409,000-square-foot open-air shopping center.\nIn the loss column, Fercan Kalkan\u2019s Houston multifamily empire is\nmired in distress\n. At least eight properties tied to Kalkan Capital and its founder are set for foreclosure auctions next week, following defaults on more than $125\u202fmillion in loans. Morgan Stanley and other lenders cite deteriorating conditions and unaddressed safety hazards at Kalkan\u2019s aging Class\u2011C apartment complexes in Houston and Pasadena.\nLakewood, New Jersey\u2013based Onyx Partners has a\ndeal to buy 119 JCPenney stores\nacross 30 states for $947 million.\nHome sales in master-planned communities\ndropped in the second quarter\n, along with the broader single-family market.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his estranged wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton,\nclaimed three homes as their primary residence\nin mortgage documents. Although the Trump Administration has been attacking enemies with\naccusations of mortgage fraud\n, the Paxtons are unlikely to be targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice, as MAGA allies. However, it\u2019s possible their lenders could require full payment as recourse.\n",

He replaces Kevin Roberts, a 36-year Transwestern veteran, who is shifting to a new role focused on strategic relationships, business development and M&amp;A.\nTranswestern President Greg Munson said the transition was \u201cthe result of significant forethought and succession planning,\u201d calling Bawcom \u201cexceptionally equipped\u201d to lead the Houston office through the firm\u2019s next phase of growth.\nBawcom brings over 25 years of experience and a deep resume that includes stints at Brookfield Properties and Cassidy Turley. During his time at Brookfield, he closed major leases with tenants like TotalEnergies and Direct Energy. He has led Cushman\u2019s Houston team since 2021.\n\nBawcom\u2019s appointment comes as Transwestern looks to better align its brokerage, property management, development and investment arms, as well as capitalize market disruptions in Houston\u2019s still-volatile office sector.\nThe leadership change also follows a string of shakeups at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Earlier this year, the firm lost a seven-person leasing team, including Chip Colvill, to Partners Real Estate. Other teams in Houston and Atlanta have also defected. In April, Cushman hired a three-person team to lead office agency leasing in Houston.\nTranswestern is a privately held commercial real estate firm, founded as a development firm by Robert Duncan in 1978.

        "content": "A $2.5 billion entertainment and mixed-use project in Mansfield is getting a heavy infusion of sci-fi hospitality.\nFrisco-based House of Tangram bought 30 acres to build a pair of high-tech hotels within the Staybolt Street District, a sprawling 100-acre development anchored by a soccer stadium and convention center, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Tangram\u2019s plans include the 288-room Carbon Mansfield hotel and a dual-branded property dubbed Cache Legitimate &amp; Kubo.\nThe concepts lean into futuristic amenities: Carbon will feature biometric check-in and adaptive climate systems personalized to guests. Cache Legitimate &amp; Kubo promises robotic bartenders, drone delivery and immersive media walls.\nTangram founder and CEO Shawn Ellis said the vision is to make Staybolt \u201cone of the most ambitious sport-anchored, technology-integrated hospitality developments in the U.S.\u201d\nThe broader Staybolt development, which started construction last year, is led by the Beck Group and includes a 7,000-seat stadium for the Hunt family\u2019s North Texas Soccer Club, a 33,000-square-foot convention center, a High5 entertainment venue and retail and residential components.\nThe Mansfield City Council approved an amended master development agreement on Monday stipulating that Tangram\u2019s hotels begin construction by late 2026, with completion slated for mid-2028.\n\nTwo multifamily projects are also part of the district: Steam, a 320-unit loft-style complex with rooftop gardens and communal kitchens, and Verona Gardens, a 400-home development offering hydroponic gardens, pet studios and green roofs.\nMansfield Mayor Michael Evans praised the partnership, calling the concept \u201ca home run\u201d for the city\u2019s sports-centric brand.\n\u201cThis innovative project aligns with our goals to focus on the future and develop a strong economy,\u201d Evans said. Jason Moore of the Mansfield Economic Development Corporation also praised the hotel projects, calling them a \u201cshared bold vision\u201d for the area.\nConstruction will be managed in part by Beck Group, which is also serving as fiduciary and general contractor for the district. If fully realized, the project could put Mansfield on the map as a hospitality testbed, or at least as the only North Texas suburb with robot bartenders and drone room service.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The Texas Real Estate Commission is working to prepare brokers for a law that will outlaw subagency and require education for licensure.\nCome January, aspiring Texas brokers will have to take a real estate course to get their licenses, an update that Summer Mandell, government and strategic communications director for the Texas Real Estate Commission, called a \u201cbig change.\u201d Additionally, joining several other states, Texas has outlawed subagency.\n\u201cSB 1968 is what we call the TREC housekeeping bill,\u201d Mandell said at a committee meeting earlier this month. The state charged TREC with creating the broker license course, which \u201cwill be a requirement for initial licensure and for renewal.\u201d\nJim Fite, head of Century 21 Judge Fite, a North Texas brokerage, had one word for the education requirement: \u201cHallelujah.\u201d\nUnder the outgoing law, an applicant for a broker license must have experience as a real estate agent and must have completed some real estate coursework. TREC requires additional coursework, but a bachelor\u2019s degree fulfills that requirement. Broker license holders must also take a broker responsibility course every two years.\nHowever, no broker responsibility course requirement for initial licensure existed before SB 1968. The new course will satisfy the requirement.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people who obtain a brokerage license,\u201d Fite said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a clue. They don\u2019t know what the risk is; they think that owning a real estate company or being a broker is a matter of, you get all the money and you don\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s just not right.\u201d\nThe bill also outlaws subagency, which Texas Realtors COO David Jones described as an \u201cantiquated\u201d holdover from the days when buyers typically lacked dedicated agents.\n\u201cSubagency occurs when a real estate agent works with a buyer but represents the interests of the seller,\u201d Brown said during his testimony in support of the bill on behalf of Texas Realtors. \u201cBy repealing subagency, consumers will have a clear understanding of who represents them. Either represent the seller, or represent the buyer, period.\u201d\nSB 1968 will also require agents to execute written agreements with prospective buyers before they show them a property. These agreements must state whether the license holder represents the prospective buyer, and they must also disclose that broker compensation is negotiable, not set by law.\nTREC published\nguidance\non SB 1968 last week. The commissioners will consider how to implement changes to broker license requirements at their meeting on Aug. 11.\n",

        "content": "A marquee Dallas skyscraper is headed for a controversial overhaul.\nSlate Asset Management and Stream Realty Partners plan to redevelop the 60-story Comerica Bank Tower, the city\u2019s third-tallest building, into a mixed-use hub with office, residential, hotel and retail components, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. It\u2019s the proposed demolition of the tower\u2019s banking hall and street-level plaza, however, that\u2019s stirred the loudest response.\nThe redevelopment, designed by Dallas architecture giant HKS, would convert roughly 1 million of the 1.6 million-square-foot tower\u2019s space. Plans call for about 600,000 square feet of modernized offices on upper floors, topped by 240 apartments, 10 percent of which would be designated affordable, and a 242-room hotel starting at the ninth floor. Developers also intend to add 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nAt the center of debate is a proposed parking garage \u201cpodium\u201d that would replace the banking hall and plaza along Ervay Street. The garage would add nearly 450 parking spaces and serve as a base for a banquet hall and amenity floors.\nStream\u2019s Ramsey March said the tower \u2014 designed by Philip Johnson and completed in 1987 \u2014 was built \u201cas a fortress\u201d and has long struggled with access and parking issues. Without intervention, occupancy could fall as low as 15 to 20 percent in the next five years, he said.\n\nMarch drew comparisons to Stream\u2019s successful repositioning of Trammell Crow Center and said the team is close to securing a deal with a \u201cvery prominent luxury category hotel.\u201d\nCritics have slammed the plan to raze the distinctive bank hall, arguing the garage would clash with the neighboring Wilson Building and Neiman Marcus flagship and erase a piece of Dallas architectural history. Architecture critic Mark Lamster, who called the building a \u201cthree-dimensional realization of 1980s Reaganomics,\u201d said the overall redevelopment was a \u201cwelcome idea\u201d but still\ntook aim at the garage\nas a \u201ctacked-on\u201d addition.\nThe city\u2019s Urban Design Peer Review Panel echoed those concerns, questioning whether the podium would create a blank, uninviting facade at street level. Slate managing director Brendan Shanahan said the designs are preliminary and will evolve during the city approval process.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The deal works out to $747 per square foot for the 292,000-square-foot building.\nNewmark\u2019s Chris Murphy, Robert Hill, Gary Carr and Austin Sheahan set up the deal with seller Kaizen Development Partners.\nThe 25-story Link at Uptown was built in 2021.

Shorenstein bought the Preston Center building from KBS with plans to renovate it.\n\nThe sale demonstrates the enduring influence of the flight-to-quality trend in the office market.\nCompanies are trying to lure their remote employees back to work with well-positioned office space that has high-end amenities.

It stands to benefit from the built-to-suit projects in the pipeline for Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs that are being developed by KDC and Hunt Realty.\nDespite the strength of these pockets of the market, the overall office vacancy rate in DFW remains high, at 27.7 percent thanks to empty space in office properties built in the \u201980s and \u201990s, according to JLL.\n",

But his ambitions went beyond bricks and mortar. Cousins partnered with former Georgia Gov. Carl Sanders in 1968 to buy the St. Louis Hawks and bring the NBA to Atlanta. The team played in the Omni Coliseum, an arena Cousins built atop a defunct railroad gulch downtown.\n\nLater in life, he turned his attention toward addressing poverty and housing inequality.\nHis most celebrated legacy may be the transformation of East Lake, once one of Atlanta\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. Working with the Atlanta Housing Authority and federal agencies, Cousins redeveloped the area with mixed-income housing, a YMCA, an elementary school and the restored East Lake Golf Club, birthplace of golf legend Bobby Jones. The project became a national model and helped launch the Purpose Built Communities\ninitiative\nCousins founded with Warren Buffett and Julian Robertson.\nAs much a force in civic life as in real estate, Cousins left an indelible mark on Atlanta. He spent his final years in Florida. He is survived by his wife, Ann, two children, Grady Cousins and Lillian Giornelli, and several grandchildren. His daughter Caroline died in 1999.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

But the by-right zoning advantage it provides could steal away Austin\u2019s power in negotiating public benefits in multifamily developments, granting privileges developers typically gain by offering affordability concessions.\nThe law applies to cities with over 150,000 residents located in counties with over 300,000 residents, which ensnares the big five as well as smaller Texas cities and suburbs like Arlington, El Paso, Irving, McKinney, Pasadena and Plano.\nLauren Middleton-Pratt, Austin\u2019s planning director, warned city leaders that the law \u201cwill significantly impact the viability of many of the city\u2019s density bonus programs,\u201d because developers will now be able to unlock entitlements by right.\n\nThe density bonus programs allow developers to build larger or denser projects in exchange for including income-restricted units or paying fees toward affordable housing.\nThe city is still analyzing how the law will affect zoning entitlements across Austin, but it\u2019s \u201cclear that an updated approach to incentivizing income-restricted units that goes beyond density bonuses will likely be necessary,\u201d Middleton-Pratt said.\nThe city is already updating its patchwork of density bonus programs, some of which have drawn criticism for being too narrow in scope or inadvertently encouraging displacement.\nAustin is among the metros most strained by high home prices and limited rental inventory. The law could help fast-track residential development in commercially zoned corridors, but it may do little to ensure that new supply is affordable.

The grocer has opened stores in Frisco, Plano and McKinney over the past few years as part of a multibillion-dollar effort to chip away at market dominance by Walmart and Kroger.\nH-E-B subsidiary\nCentral Market\nis advancing a plan for a flagship store in Uptown.\n\nSherman, about 70 miles north of Dallas, has long been more farmland than boomtown, but that\u2019s changing fast.\nTexas Instruments started construction on a\n$30 billion semiconductor fabrication plant\nexpected to bring thousands of jobs to the area, many of them high-paying roles. Dallas-Fort Worth leads the nation in STEM wage growth over the past five years, rising 32.7 percent \u2014 more than Silicon Valley or Austin, according to\nCoworkingCafe\n.\nThat rising tide of engineers, researchers and software workers has helped fuel residential and retail development across the northern reaches of DFW. Jeff Harkinson, general partner of Sherman Crossroads Limited, called H-E-B\u2019s purchase \u201canother milestone for Sherman\u201d and a vote of confidence in the site\u2019s status as a future retail destination.\nThe Sherman store follows H-E-B\u2019s familiar pattern: buy early, wait for rooftops and build big.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

JLL\u2019s Mark Nicholas, Will Clay, Angela Watford and Martin Gutierrez have the listing and are marketing it as a rare opportunity in one of the country\u2019s most rapidly transforming trade gateways, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The land sits on the north side of the port\u2019s ship channel and includes 7,200 feet of highway frontage.\nVista Del Mar Chairman Laurence Jones cited the port\u2019s growing importance in industry as the motivation to sell. The company has owned the land since 1928.\nThe Port of Brownsville plans to expand its operations into container cargo, a significant shift from its bulk-focused operations, and a potential catalyst for surrounding industrial growth. About 1.1 million metric tons of cargo moved through the port last year.\nIt also comes as the area\u2019s most famous resident, SpaceX, is expanding.\n\nMusk has incorporated his Starbase complex into a company town with prefab housing for about 500 people, mostly SpaceX employees and their families. Legislation is in motion that could grant the private town\u2019s commissioners the power to restrict public beach access during weekday launch activity.\nMusk\u2019s presence in Texas also includes the headquarters of Tesla in Austin and the Boring Company and X in Bastrop. The Boring Company is facing community backlash to its plans for a\ntunnel\nthat would create an eight-minute commute from downtown Nashville to the Nashville International Airport.\nTesla this week signed a\n$1.6 billion deal with Samsung\n, which is building a semiconductor plant in the Austin suburb Taylor.

The development will also include apartments, as well as schools and public safety facilities.\nThe deal marks Centurion\u2019s latest move to stake out North Texas\u2019 outer-ring frontier. Moayedi\u2019s firm has acquired\nat least 7,000 acres\nin the past two years, positioning itself as one of the most aggressive players in the state\u2019s residential land race. The firm\u2019s active projects span Celina, Pilot Point, Howe, Sherman and Gunter, including the 4,200-home Platinum Ranch and the 1,400-acre Cottonwood development.\n\nPreston Harbor is being master-planned by Craig International and spans over 3,100 acres with 9.5 miles of lakefront. The full development is expected to bring more than 7,500 homes, a $150 million Margaritaville resort, plus other retail and restaurants and a marina. The population of Denison could grow by more than 18,000 people once it\u2019s fully built out.\n\u201cNo one can create the velocity of lot production like Mehrdad Moayedi,\u201d Craig told the outlet.\nThe acquisition gives Centurion a foothold in one of North Texas\u2019 largest destination-style projects to date. It also further extends the developer\u2019s footprint into Grayson County, where growing semiconductor investments and infrastructure plans have driven a wave of land speculation.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

City leaders and tourism officials say the upgrade is necessary to attract larger conventions and boost hotel stays, with Visit Austin estimating a 60 percent increase in the center\u2019s economic impact, up to $750 million annually.\nThe petition argues that the project is a misallocation of public resources, calling for hotel occupancy tax revenues to instead be directed to music, arts, cultural institutions and parks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal waste of money,\u201d said Bill Bunch, an environmental lawyer and longtime activist involved with the PAC and Save Our Springs Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a theft of funds that \u2026 should be supporting what actually brings visitors to Austin.\u201d\n\nThe group has argued that the cost is far higher than reported.\nBunch cited city estimates suggesting $5.6 billion in pledged revenue could be needed to cover debt over the life of the financing plan; city officials countered that this figure reflects long-term revenue, not the true cost of the project.\nCity Council Member Marc Duchen, the sole vote against a recent $25 million project management contract increase, raised concerns about the long-term strain on tourism funding. While skeptical that stopping the project is feasible, he voiced support for requiring voter input on future large-scale projects.\nThe convention center is scheduled to reopen in early 2029.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "The Appraisal Institute, a major provider of licensing education and credentialing for real estate appraisers, reached a confidential settlement with former CEO Cindy Chance, ending a lawsuit that raised serious concerns about workplace misconduct and mismanagement.\nThe institute, headquartered at 200 West Madison Street in Chicago, denied the allegations in Chance\u2019s complaint, according to\nBisnow\n. In its weekly newsletter, the Appraisal Institute stated that settling the case was in the best interests of the organization, its members and the broader real estate finance industry. In a message to members, the nonprofit called it a \u201clearning experience\u201d and pledged to make improvements based on member feedback.\nThe settlement announcement did not include any financial figures.\nThe suit, filed in May in Illinois\u2019 Cook County Circuit Court, alleged that Chance was terminated after she reported several complaints from female employees about inappropriate behavior by Craig Steinley, a former Appraisal Institute president. Chance claimed that Steinley groped her and engaged in other misconduct, and that she was pressured to cover up the complaints.\nChance maintained she was trying to change the culture at the organization, according to\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\n.\n\nSteinley denied all allegations but eventually stepped down under pressure from the Appraisal Institute\u2019s board due to member backlash. He was removed as a defendant in June, after which Chance\u2019s attorney withdrew, leaving her without legal representation.\nChance joined the institute as CEO in September 2023 and was dismissed a year later. Her suit suggested a pattern of misconduct within the organization. The New York Times corroborated her claims, reporting that 12 women described uncomfortable encounters with Steinley and revealed a previously unreported $412,000 settlement the Appraisal Institute paid in May 2024 to its former CFO, who accused the organization of maintaining a \u201csexually hostile work environment.\u201d\nIn parallel to Chance\u2019s lawsuit, another former employee, Alissa Akins, filed a separate complaint alleging she was forced out after flagging irregularities in AI\u2019s continuing education exams. According to Akins, flawed scoring systems resulted in some unqualified appraisers passing and competent ones failing. The institute attempted to dismiss her suit, but the motion was denied and litigation continues.\nThese controversies come at a time when the broader appraisal industry faces significant challenges. The Appraisal Subcommittee, the federal agency tasked with regulating the industry, is under scrutiny from Congress amid allegations of mismanagement and staffing instability. A Bisnow investigation revealed budget cuts and leadership turmoil at ASC, culminating in the recent resignation of acting head Matt Ponzar.\nU.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Mike Rounds of South Dakota have called on the subcommittee to explain the alleged mismanagement, highlighting the agency\u2019s importance to the stability of both residential and commercial real estate markets.\n",

        "content": "Restaurant operators are driving New York City\u2019s retail comeback, giving rise to the new landlord mantra \u201cIf you can vent it, you can rent it.\u201d\nQuick-service chains, viral dessert shops and upscale cocktail lounges are snapping up space at a pace that\u2019s pushing availability to decade-long lows, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Retail availability in Manhattan\u2019s 11 busiest corridors dropped to 12.8 percent in the second quarter, the tightest market since 2014, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThat demand is spilling into previously non-restaurant spaces. Conversion costs to add kitchen infrastructure can hit six figures, but more tenants are ponying up to secure prime spots.\nRestaurants account for at least 35 percent of all leased retail square footage in the city over the last decade. The rise tracks with post-pandemic shifts in consumer habits: more dining out, app-driven ordering and a surge in food-centric social media content; spending on top delivery platforms hit a record $120 million in the first quarter, per city data.\n\nOperators are tailoring concepts to meet the moment. Cava, Joe &amp; the Juice and Naya offer frictionless app ordering; relative newcomers like Anita Gelato and BabySips wine bar lean hard into Instagram aesthetics. Frankie Solarik\u2019s BarChef in Midtown \u2014 a $43-cocktail concept with elaborate plating \u2014 books out its weekends weeks in advance.\nDespite the land grab, rents remain below pre-pandemic highs, thanks to the glut of second-generation restaurant spaces that hit the market after 2020\u2019s mass closures. But they\u2019re set to rise fast, especially in trendy neighborhoods like the East Village and the Lower East Side, where some listings draw double-digit offers in days.\nWhile e-commerce has impacted other retail sectors, restaurant real estate is proving resilient. \u201cThey\u2019re ecommerce-proof,\u201d said Steve Soutendijk of Cushman, noting that New York\u2019s roughly 29,000 restaurants remain impervious to the factors thwarting other aspects of the retail world.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Gyllenhaal purchased the unit for\n$8.6 million\nin 2017.\nThe buyer\u2019s identity is shielded by an LLC with an address in Los Angeles. Gyllenhaal bought the property with his Woodrow Trust, an entity registered to his business manager, Warren Grant, and used in another of his purchases, a Hollywood Hills home, in 2005.\nUnit 5J spans 2,900 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, according to a previous listing on StreetEasy.\n\nAmenities in the 53-unit conversion, developed by Metro Lofts\u2019 Nathan Berman, include a 24-hour doorman, indoor pool, roof deck and fitness center. Other features have earned it a reputation for being \u201cpaparazzi-proof,\u201d including an underground parking garage with valet service and a resident-only courtyard.\nGyllenhaal was one of many A-list buyers at the 19th-century book bindery-turned-luxury condominium. Among the latest deals at the building is actor Mike Myers\u2019 sale of Unit 5A for roughly\n$21 million\nlast year. Bill Gates\u2019 daughter, Jennifer Gates, paid\n$51 million\nfor a penthouse at the building, which once belonged to Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton, in 2023.\nThough the building frequently lands in the press for its star-studded trades, the developer and its architect, CetraRuddy, have faced\nbacklash from unit owners\nover alleged construction defects and code violations. The condo board sued Berman and others involved in the development in 2021, seeking $376 million in damages.\nThe complaint describes the issues as multiple leaks in the penthouses, a defective drainage system in the courtyard and improperly laid bricks. Berman and CetraRuddy denied the allegations. The litigation is still pending.\n",

        "content": "Rolling Meadows officials are looking to intercept some momentum of the potential new Chicago Bears stadium nearby to score a big real estate proposal of their own.\nThe suburban government is making a bid to recruit developers for a long-vacant, city-owned property that could benefit from the planned NFL team\u2019s redevelopment at Arlington Park, just 1.5 miles away.\nThe site at 3500 Wellington Court is kitty-corner from Rolling Meadows City Hall at the southeast corner of Kirchoff Road and Owl Lane. It belongs in the closest commercial corridor to the new stadium and officials see it as a prime opportunity for retail and dining development in anticipation of increased demand driven by stadium attendees, as\nreported by the Daily Herald\n.\nIn a newly released request for proposals, the city outlines its vision for the 1-acre parcel, encouraging retail and service uses including restaurants, brew pubs, microbreweries, microdistilleries and microwineries.\nThe request emphasizes the desirability of outdoor features including plazas, gardens, public art and seating areas to create an inviting pedestrian environment. However, the city discourages drive-through businesses and explicitly rules out proposals that are exclusively residential.\nThe effort to attract developers comes on the heels of a broader planning initiative for the Kirchoff Road corridor. In May, the City Council approved new zoning changes creating a \u201cTC\u201d Town Center district, which allows for higher-density, pedestrian-friendly development. This includes buildings up to 70 feet tall and parking areas located behind structures to support a more walkable and visually appealing streetscape.\n\nFull endorsement of the comprehensive 110-page Kirchoff Road Corridor Study has stalled due to controversy surrounding one of its key recommendations: reducing Kirchoff Road from five lanes to three.\nProponents of this \u201croad diet\u201d argue it would add public parking, slow traffic, and enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists \u2014 all of which could support more vibrant commercial development. However, local business owners and other opponents fear the changes would increase traffic congestion and harm their operations, according to the Daily Herald.\nThe city-owned Wellington Court site has remained undeveloped since the Great Recession derailed plans for a mixed-use condo project that was to include ground-floor retail. Now, the city hopes to revive the site with a new project aligned with its updated interest in the nearby sports venue.\nDevelopers can submit proposals by Sept. 30. A winning proposal will result in a property sale and a development deal with the city.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

In January, the company\nbought a 500,000-square-foot\n, four-building office complex also in Santa Clara.\nThe company was reportedly looking for a 30,000-square-foot sales office in San Francisco in May, according to the Chronicle.

The accompanying surge in hiring is predicted to bring between 50,000 and 60,000 new jobs to the city.\nOpenAI\n, for example, has already nabbed about 1 million square feet across the city.\nThe Mission Rock mixed-use development across Mission Bay from Oracle Park is\nattracting commercial tenants\nand will feature a combination of retail, offices and housing upon completion. The Mission Bay neighborhood itself is well positioned amid San Francisco\u2019s sagging office market with an office vacancy rate of 12.2 percent, Robert Sammons, senior director for tech research at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, told the Chronicle.

Schwartz said the firm polled employees who expressed a clear preference to remain in the core \u2014 from Third to Seventh Avenue, and between Central Park and 42nd Street. With transit and client proximity top of mind, 31 West 52nd fit the bill.\nManhattan\u2019s office market\nembraced the summer heat\nlast month. Tenants inked deals for 3 million square feet in July, up nearly 11 percent from the previous month, according to a Colliers report.\nThe borough is on track for 40 million square feet of leasing activity by year\u2019s end, a level not seen since the pre-pandemic heyday of 2019, per Colliers. Manhattan\u2019s availability shrank to 15.2 percent, the lowest since January 2021. Sublet supply also continued its downward trend, hitting its leanest level in five years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "DRA Advisors is dipping into Miami\u2019s Allapattah multifamily market, acquiring a 263-unit apartment complex for $73.5 million.\nAn affiliate of New York-based\nDRA\n, led by David Luski, bought Modera Skylar at 1444 Northwest 14th Avenue, records and real estate database Vizzda show. The buyer also assumed a $60.5 million mortgage from JLL Real Estate Capital.\nDRA paid $279,467 per apartment.\nModera Skylar consists of two 20-story buildings and a five-story parking garage with a rooftop pool deck. The complex offers a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.\nBuilt in two phases, Modera Skylar\u2019s first 166 units were completed in 2013, records show. A partnership between Boca Raton-based\nMill Creek Residential\nand San Francisco-based Rockwood Capital paid $47.5 million for the 8.5-acre site in 2018. The joint venture completed the second phase consisting of 97 apartments four years later.\n\nIn recent years, Allapattah has seen a wave of new apartment projects with higher than average rents. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood is $2,500 a month, compared to $2,100 a month for Miami overall, according to Rentcafe.com.\nModera Skylar is about one block south from The Fifteen Miami, a nine-story project with 132 apartments that Fort Worth, Texas-based Olympus Property purchased for\n$45.9 million\n.\nTwo recently completed Allapattah multifamily projects by Lisette Calderon\u2019s Neology Development Group also scored major refinancings. In January, New York-based Apollo Asset Management provided a $84.5 million loan for The Julia Residences, a 14-story building with 323 apartments at 1625 Northwest 20th Street. The mortgage paid off a previous\n$78.2 million\nloan.\nLess than a month earlier, Miami Beach-based Starwood Property Trust, led by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, provided a\n$63.5 million\nmortgage for Fourteen Main Street Residences, a complex consisting of a 14-story tower and a five-story building with 237 apartments combined. The Starwood loan paid off a $57.5 million mortgage.\nThe Julia features one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging from $2,300 a month to $3,848 a month, according to Apartments.com. Fourteen Main Street Residences consists of one- and two-bedroom units, with rents from $2,231 to $3,216 a month.",

The sellers are two entities managed by Palm Beach Equine Clinic President Scott Swerdlin, founder Edward Wollenman, Robert Brusie and Robert Boswell, all equestrian veterans in Wellington.\n\nThe Palm Beach Equine Sports Complex last sold for $4.5 million in 2004, according to property records. The complex was built in 1979 and includes a range of equestrian facilities, including six riding arenas, barns totaling 336 stalls, a 17-acre pond, on-site apartments for staff and a private lounge for riders, its website shows. The facility is walking distance to Wellington International, the showgrounds that host the Winter Equestrian Festival, which is considered a significant perk among the village\u2019s equestrian buyers.\nBoth Stephen Orthwein Jr. and Peter B. Orthwein are descendants of Adolphus Busch, the founder of beermaking giant\nAnheuser-Busch\n. They are longtime polo players, according to published reports. Stephen Orthwein Jr. is co-owner of Franklin Polo Academy in Franklin, Tennessee. Peter B. Orthwein also co-founded Thor Industries, the recreational vehicle company that produces Airstreams, Jayco and Hymer RVs. Records show he paid $5.7 million for a Palm Beach house at 202 Garden Road in 2017.\nWellington\nis the epicenter of equestrian sports in America, drawing showjumpers, polo and dressage riders to its winter and spring competitions. High-profile equestrians who train in Wellington include Bill Gates\u2019 daughter\nJennifer Gates\n, her husband Nayel Nassar, Steve Jobs\u2019 daughter Eve Jobs and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s daughter Jessica Springsteen.\nThe athletes fuel the village\u2019s market for luxury equestrian estates.

It\u2019s the third mall the landlord has lost to foreclosure in the last year, Syracuse.com\nreported\n.\nLast month, a judge approved the foreclosure of the mall, ordering the asset be auctioned off within 90 days or as soon as possible. Pyramid defaulted on a $26 million mortgage backing the mall last year, failing to pay its debt by the loan\u2019s maturity date.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland provided the mortgage in 2010. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas later assumed the debt \u2014 acting as a trustee for the commercial mortgage-backed securities the loan was folded into \u2014 and filed its foreclosure action on the mall last May.\nIn July 2024, a judge appointed a receiver for the property. Last month, a $26.5 million judgment was issued against the 630,000-square-foot mall; Pyramid declined to fight the foreclosure and agreed to the default judgment.\nAs one of Pyramid\u2019s smaller properties, the owner\u2019s degree of concern about losing the Aviation Mall may have been muted. Besides, there\u2019s plenty of other issues befalling the company.\n\nA year ago, Pyramid\nlost\nthe 470,000-square-foot, one-story Hampshire Mall in Hadley, Massachusetts, to foreclosure. The asset counted a tenant roster including JCPenney, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Planet Fitness and Cinemark Theaters.\nIn April, a New York state judge\ngranted a summary judgment\nto Wilmington Trust, which holds $418.5 million in debt backed by the Palisades Center in West Nyack. Wilmington Trust, acting as a trustee for CMBS bondholders,\nfiled to foreclose\non the 2.2 million-square-foot shopping and entertainment complex in 2023, claiming Syracuse-based Pyramid defaulted on the loan tied to the Rockland County property.\nAnd the same month, the Pyramid affiliate that owns Destiny USA in Syracuse \u2014 the crown jewel of its portfolio \u2014\ndefaulted on a $300 million mortgage\n. It failed to secure a loan extension when the maturity date of the mortgage came around the previous June, according to Pyramid\u2019s most recent financial statements.\nLenders have not come after that property yet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Meta has been cutting down its footprint at Brickyard over the past few years, and Tishman is reportedly marketing the space in anticipation of the end of Meta\u2019s lease at the end of next year.\nMeta\nlisted a majority of its space at the Playa Vista building for sublease early last year but has yet to find a subtenant, which could explain why it\u2019s looking to leave the multifloor space altogether, according to CoStar.\nThe company\u2019s offices are in one of two buildings that make up the more than 437,725-square-foot Brickyard complex. Meta, back when it was named Facebook, signed a lease to take over the entirety of both buildings in late 2018. At the time, the Menlo Park, California-based corporation was among the global tech companies growing its real estate holdings before the pandemic led companies around the world to reconsider how much office space they occupied.\n\nSo far this year, Meta has listed for sublease one of its two Seattle office buildings it had pre-leased before the pandemic, according to CoStar.

        "content": "A luxury condominium tower in Houston\u2019s Tanglewood neighborhood will reflect a growing trend among developers: Catering to buyers concerned about power outages and extreme weather.\nNamed The Beverly, the project is a collaboration between developers RAMA Co. and G.T. Leach Constructors, according to a report by the\nHouston Chronicle\n. Located at 5010 Longmont Drive, the seven-story tower will include just six full-floor residences, each spanning over 4,300 square feet, with private foyers accessed via two elevators..\nMarketing for The Beverly emphasizes uninterrupted, secure living. Each unit will come with a whole-home 26-kilowatt Generac generator, connected to a natural gas line, capable of automatically powering the entire residence during outages. An additional generator will support critical building systems, including elevators and emergency lighting.\nThe secure power systems directly respond to demand for backup power solutions following major power outages in Houston during events like the 2021 winter storms and Hurricane Beryl in 2024.\n\nThe Chronicle said the systems, which cost between $13,000 and $40,000, have become a selling point. Data from the Houston Association of Realtors (HAR) shows that the number of single-family homes listing generators as a feature nearly quadrupled from 518 in 2018 to 1,928 in 2024. However, such systems remain rare in multifamily housing; as of August 1, only 10 condos or townhomes on the Houston market listed a generator as a perk.\nNancy Almodovar of Nan and Co. Properties, the brokerage for The Beverly, said the project appeals to those seeking a \u201clock-and-leave\u201d lifestyle \u2014 especially residents looking to downsize without leaving Tanglewood. The inclusion of full-home generators adds to a sense of safety and convenience, which she described as \u201celevated bunkers in the sky.\u201d\nWith prices starting at $3.5 million, the development aims to strike a balance between privacy and exclusivity. \u201cWe weren\u2019t interested in building as many units as possible,\u201d said RAMA Co. co-founder Amir Taghdisi. \u201cSix full-floor homes felt like the right balance of intimacy and luxury.\u201d\nThe Beverly marks the first condominium project for G.T. Leach President Gary Leach, who is also investing in the development. Completion is expected in the second quarter of 2026.",

        "content": "Embattled Paramount Group revealed the company is under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, months after telling shareholders it made millions of dollars in previously\nundisclosed payments\nto its CEO\u2019s companies.\nThe publicly traded company said the SEC is investigating the firm\u2019s disclosures related to executive compensation, perks, corporate asset use, related party transactions and conflicts of interest. The investigation will also look at controls and procedures related to those disclosures.\nParamount, a large office owner in New York City and San Francisco, disclosed the existence of the investigation in a filing with the SEC announcing its second-quarter earnings on July 30. Paramount said in the filing that it is cooperating with the SEC.\nThe investigation occurs as Paramount is under intense scrutiny from shareholders. It is also considering a possible sale of the company and has hired Bank of America as its financial advisor.\nAn inquiry by the SEC is not much of a surprise. Earlier this year, Paramount revealed it paid millions of dollars to companies controlled by its CEO, Albert Behler.\nThe payments to Behler\u2019s outside companies were previously undisclosed to public shareholders and were only revealed by Paramount this year. The expenditures included over $3 million to a private jet company in which Behler owns a 50 percent stake. Paramount also spent over $900,000 on Behler\u2019s personal accounting services between 2022 and 2024.\nIn addition, Paramount paid over $200,000 for a company controlled Behler\u2019s wife to design a lounge at Paramount\u2019s 1301 Sixth Avenue office building. In February, the firm inked another $225,000 contract with Behler\u2019s wife\u2019s design firm.\nParamount also spent $12,000 for wine from Behler\u2019s German vineyard, while Behler racked up $77,000 more than the company\u2019s allotment for club memberships.\nPublic companies are required to report related party transactions over $120,000 under SEC rules.\nBehler\u2019s undisclosed payments were tacked on to his impressive compensation package of $20.2 million in 2023.\nAfter news broke about the undisclosed payments, Paramount announced a major shakeup in leadership. Wilbur Paes, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Gage Johnson, Paramount\u2019s general counsel, are leaving the company. Board member Katharina Otto-Bernstein and daughter of Paramount founder Werner Otto, has also left.\n\nParamount parted with its outside legal counsel Goodwin Procter, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe company said it is undergoing a review of strategic alternatives, which could include a sale.\nParamount previously rejected two bids to sell the company in 2020 and 2022 for as high as $12 per share. Paramount\u2019s stock is trading much lower, at $6.28 by end of day Monday.\nDuring its second-quarter earnings call, only one analyst asked about the SEC investigation.\nBehler said the investigation was related to certain \u201chistorical disclosures.\u201d He said he did not expect it to have any \u201csignificant impact at all to the strategic review.\u201d\nBut the investigation has already cost the firm in legal fees.\nParamount disclosed in its SEC filing that it has reached an indemnification agreement with Wilbur Paes, the former COO, CFO and treasurer, to reimburse Paes for certain costs incurred by the investigation. These costs included fees paid to Paes\u2019s lawyer totaling $274,000 during the first half of 2025.\nIn the SEC filing, Paramount said it is \u201cunable to estimate the likely outcome of this matter, or a reasonably probable range of potential costs or exposure, or the potential duration of the process, at this time.\u201d\nIn a statement, the firm did not address the investigation or the payments to Paes. Instead, a spokesperson said, \u201cfollowing a successful first two quarters marked by strong leasing activity, we remain focused on our strategic review in order to maximize shareholder value.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One week after four people were shot and killed at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue, police officers stood outside the office high-rise as employees trickled in and out of the building.\nThe chaotic scene that unfolded last week was replaced by one of quiet but clear increases in security Monday morning: A New York City police officer stood in the building\u2019s expansive plaza, staring out at Park Avenue. Another officer stood within the lobby, by a pillar that offered a view of the revolving doors on Park Avenue and 51st Street. Building staffers were stationed near the building\u2019s other entrances and within the lobby.\nLast Monday, Shane Tamura, 27, walked into the Park Avenue tower with an assault rifle. Police say Tamura opened fire and killed three people in the lobby:\nWesley LePatner\n, the chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust; NYPD officer Didarul Islam; and Aland Etienne, a security guard. Officials believe Tamura was targeting the National Football Association, which has its headquarters in the building, but mistakenly took the elevator to the 33rd floor, where Rudin has its offices. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the killings, police officers and other security personnel could be seen outside office buildings throughout Midtown. Beyond such immediate signs of extra attention to workplace safety, building managers and companies are also considering longer-term changes.\n\u201cUnfortunately, when something like this happens, it forces you to rethink everything,\u201d said Dave Komendat, founder of Seattle-based Komendat Risk Management Services.\nBuilding owners are reevaluating their security measures and staffing levels, and reviewing emergency communications systems they have in place. For example, RXR told\nTRD\nthat the company is reviewing and updating its shelter-in-place, lockdown and evacuation protocols and conducting security and emergency assessments at all of its properties.\nThe shootings will likely prompt building owners and tenants to consider incorporating more security technologies, such as strategically placed duress buttons that allow front desk staff or individual tenants to immediately contact emergency personnel. Lobbies can incorporate natural cover and concealment, in the form of concrete benches, planters or the security desk, Komedat said.\nNewer class A buildings often already have advanced elevator systems that limit floor access or allow the elevators to be remotely disabled. For buildings that already incorporate security technologies, it may involve ensuring tenants know the proper protocol and that building staff are aware of the full spectrum of available safety features.\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t realize we already have this kind of locking system, or we have the ability to program our elevators,\u201d said Peggy Phillips, who leads Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s protective design and security practice.\nSome buildings incorporate rooms that can be locked or blockaded in an emergency. High-profile companies might opt for more extreme options for their C-suite, including bunker-like safe rooms reinforced with steel plates, Phillips said.\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, Mayor Eric Adams noted that the Park Avenue tower has bathrooms that double as safe rooms, with bulletproof doors. He credited those rooms with playing \u201ca major role in not having a greater loss of life.\u201d\n\u201cThere were many things that Rudin Management put in place to make their tenants safe,\u201d Adams said.\nA representative for the company declined to comment on any additional security measures the firm is taking.\nJohn Orloff, who leads security risk management for Jensen Hughes and is a former inspector with the U.S. Secret Service, said dual authentication is key: Meaning, tenants are required to verify their identity at multiple points in order to gain access to different parts of a building. Maybe a tenant uses one form of identification at the turnstile, but another to access a specific floor from the elevator or to enter an office once on that floor.\nActive shooter training is also critical, he said.\n\u201cOur kids are better trained in knowing what to do with an active assailant than most of their parents,\u201d he said.\n\nEmployees should also refrain from entering public spaces with their office ID cards in visible or easily snatchable places, he added.\nCamera technology that uses artificial intelligence to identify potential weapons can provide even just a few seconds of additional warning to police, especially in cases where witnesses do not immediately call 911.\n\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t trust what they see,\u201d Komendat said.\nTamura double-parked his BMW on Park Avenue and walked across the large plaza outside the Park Avenue high-rise, carrying the rifle. The shades in the building\u2019s lobby were down to block the sun, and Tamura\u2019s approach went unnoticed,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nPhillips said she works closely with architects when designing an office building\u2019s lobby to establish clear sight lines for cameras and building personnel to monitor who is approaching the building.\nOf course, making changes to an existing office building is different from working with the blank slate that ground-up construction offers. Phillips advises her clients to install flexible infrastructure that allows the magnitude of security features to be adjusted. That could take the form of a temporary ballistic shield for the front desk, or if renovating the lobby, installing equipment that allows for turnstiles to eventually be built to block off certain areas from the public.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all been in office lobbies where they\u2019ve added equipment after events, and it\u2019s become like an obstacle course,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think the other thing that you learn from each of these events is that it is never quite like the last one,\u201d she continued. \u201cBeing able to recognize that the threat condition does change, and that having that flexibility to either toggle up or toggle down your security is beneficial because you are not put into a position where you have security protocol that is more onerous than necessary or not sufficient.\u201d\nOrloff warned against drastic changes to workplace security. He said it is important to make employees feel that their safety is top priority, but also to roll out changes in a measured way.\n\u201cYou have to make incremental cultural changes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go from having an open door policy to locking the place down.\u201d\nBuilding owners, managers and tenants cannot possibly prepare for every kind of disaster. Last week\u2019s tragedies show that even modern office buildings fortified with high-tech security solutions, security staff and\ntraining sessions\ncan be vulnerable.\nHigh-profile office tenants often have their own safety protocols and will have a separate front desk and elevator bank. Phillips expects security to be a greater emphasis on office security going forward, but also a heightened \u201cawareness that there are threat scenarios that could affect a wider range of people.\u201d\nKomedat said property owners will likely face increased pressure from tenants to increase security.\n\u201cIt always comes back to money,\u201d Komedat said. \u201cThose building management companies that want to attract and retain tenants will look at this very seriously.\u201d\nOthers won\u2019t want to make the investment.\n\u201cClearly, there will be landlords and management companies that will look at this and think this probably won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cHope is not a strategy.\u201d\n\u201cBut these things cost money,\u201d he added, \u201cAnd some will spend it and others won\u2019t.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The precise stroke of a pen is bringing an end to a lease for one commercial tenant.\nLandlord Soloviev Group won a case against a kosher deli that has been leasing the ground floor of its Billionaires\u2019 Row building. The case has dragged on for a decade, and an appeal is now on the table after a judge this week sided with the landlord\u2019s claim that signatures at issue in the case had been forged.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a tenant just give you a fake lease,\u201d said Alexander Estis with Rosenberg &amp; Estis, representing the plaintiff. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why our client fought it for so long.\u201d\nThe deli, Great American Health Bar, signed a 20-year lease with the building\u2019s former owner in 2000. In 2006, the landlord, then called Solow Management, bought the property at 35 West 57th Street through an LLC for $24.4 million. At one point the landlord claimed the tenant defaulted on the lease, which the deli fought in court.\nIn 2014, the restaurant produced another amendment. This one was allegedly signed by the former owner before the sale. That document said the lease could continue until 2040 under certain conditions. But by the time the document was brought to light, the former owner and signatory had died.\nLawyers for the landlord argued that the document was fake. It wasn\u2019t disclosed during prior litigation about the lease and only was revealed after the former owner\u2019s death, making it too good to be true.\nDefendants instead painted a picture of a wealthy landlord desperate to get a tenant out by any means necessary. If the document was forged, it wouldn\u2019t have been five pages, including terms unfavorable to the tenant, lawyers for the deli argued during trial.\n\u201cThere has just been a multitude of litigation because this landlord is on a tirade to get this last building, the last tenant,\u201d defendants lawyers said during trial, \u201cso they can demolish it and have a demolition site on this property.\u201d\n\nBoth sides retained handwriting experts. Despite disagreements about other matters, the two came to similar conclusions that the potentially forged document was not signed by the same person who signed two other documents.\nIn her decision, Judge Margaret Chan also cast doubt on the deli owner\u2019s testimony that he witnessed the owner sign the disputed amendment, which contradicted earlier statements.\n\u201cThe only logical conclusion is that the Disputed Amendment is a forgery,\u201d Chan wrote in her decision.\nMichael Terk, a lawyer for the defendants with David Rozenholc &amp; Associates, said his team believes the decision was an error and they are pursuing an appeal.\n\u201cMost of what is at issue is facts that are not referenced in the decision at all,\u201d he said.\nLawyers for Soloviev said they were not privy to any development or demotion plans for the property.\n\u201cThe case stands as a lesson to tenants,\u201d said Norman Flitt, an attorney with Rosenberg &amp; Estis representing the plaintiff. \u201cNo matter how elaborate your contrivance may be, truth will come to bear.\u201d\n",

        "content": "There were 217 deals, totaling about $430 million, recorded in New York City on Monday, August 4, 2025.\n\ud83c\udfc6Residential:\nThe top residential sale recorded in New York City was in the West Village.\nWith Appreciation LLC\ndropped $17.7 million on a 19th-century, Greek Revival townhouse at\n246 West 12th Street\n. The seller was a company tied to\nJonathan Chen\n, who paid $8.5 million for the home in 2018. The residence stands five stories tall and has 5,100 square feet of living space and about 1,500 square feet of exterior space. The deal appears to have been off market.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was sold by the Catholic Church. The\nRoman Catholic Church\noffloaded a church and two religious facilities at\n329, 341 and 343 West 25th Street\nin Chelsea for $48.3 million. The buyer was an affiliate of\nTimber Equities\n, who took on a $33 million mortgage from\nNEG Financing 4 LLC\n. Timber Equities plans to raze the site for redevelopment,\naccording to Commercial Observer\n. JLL\u2019s\nGuthrie Garvin\nand\nJonathan Hageman\nmarketed the site\n, touting it as one of the next residential conversions in New York.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential:\nJake Gyllenhaal\nparted with a three-bedroom condominium at\n443 Greenwich Street\nin Tribeca for $14 million. The Academy Award-nominated actor paid\n$8.6 million for the pad in 2017\n. The new buyer is an LLC with an address in Los Angeles. The unit spans 2,900 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $4,800 per square foot. The sale appears to have been an off-market deal.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential:\nLiam Neeson\nsold his place at the Park Millennium building at\n111 West 67th Street\nin Lincoln Square for $10.3 million. The buyers were\nMartin Zetterberg\nand\nJoanmarie Land Zetterberg.\nThe residence spans 4,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The property\u2019s most recent asking price was about $10.8 million. Coleman Real Estate Group\u2019s\nMatthew Coleman\nhad the listing, which first went live in February with an asking price of $12.8 million.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn the Flatiron District, a development site at\n10 West 17th Street\ntraded hands for $16.2 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAnbau\nand the buyer was an affiliate of\nProsper property Group\n, which took on $11 million in financing for the deal from a company tied to\nNorthwind Group\n. The seller bought the site, now vacant, a decade ago from the Catholic Medical Mission Board, and reportedly had planned to build a 17-story residential tower there.\n\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nThe\nNew School\nsold a townhouse at\n21 West 11th Street\nin Greenwich Village for $10.3 million \u2014 about half its original asking price. The 20-foot-wide property dates to 1850 and stands five stories tall. The New School put the home on the market in March 2024 for $20 million. Leslie J. Garfield\u2019s\nMatt Lesser,\nMatt Pravda, Tori Landon\nand\nMatthew Lipsky\nrepresented the seller. The buyer was a trust connected to\nMichael B. Benner\n, general counsel at real estate firm Tishman Speyer.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. construction spending drops amid economic uncertainty\nThe U.S. construction slowdown persisted in June, as the industry pulled back on shelling out money for new projects for the second month in a row.\nIn June, construction spending came in at $2.1 trillion \u2014 down 0.4 percent from May and 2.9 percent year over year, according to new figures released by the\nU.S. Census Bureau\n.\nFor the first half of the year, construction has been 2.2 percent lower compared to the same time last year.",

        "content": "It is go time for the Midtown South rezoning. Will the City Council leave the plan intact?\nOn Wednesday, the City Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises and the Committee on Land Use will vote on the proposal to rezone 42 blocks in the Manhattan neighborhood.\nThe rezoning is projected to pave the way for 9,700 housing units, with up to 2,890 set aside as permanently affordable units.\nIf approved as proposed, this would be the first time that the city has mapped\nnew residential districts\nthat allow housing projects to be 15 or 18 times larger than their lot sizes. As part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the city created R11 and R12 residential districts, where residential space can have a floor area ratio of 15 or 18, respectively. The change was made possible when the state lifted a restriction that capped residential space at 12 FAR last year.\nThis would also mark the first time that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing is used in Midtown Manhattan.\nDuring a hearing last month, City Planning addressed a proposal to reduce density in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area, where the city wants to allow 18 FAR residential space. The proposal calls for 12, which the agency said would result in a 55 percent loss of housing.\nLocal City Council members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers have been supportive of the rezoning but also\nechoed concerns\nabout the fashion industry businesses (manufacturers and wholesalers) getting pushed out by property owners who are keen to demolish their buildings and cash in on the upzoning.\nA watered-down version of the rezoning would not bode well for the future of these residential districts in other parts of the city. If you can\u2019t make R11 and R12 districts work in a \u201cdense, busy, transit-rich part of Midtown,\u201d as the borough president\npreviously put it\n, where can you?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What changes, if any, will the City Council make to the Midtown South rezoning? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n:\nBoston\u2019s broker fee law\n, which requires the hiring party to pay a residential broker\u2019s commission, went into effect on Friday. New York\u2019s law has been in effect since June 11.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s tariffs, threats and trash talk are driving a drop in tourism spending in NYC, according to\nGothamist\n. New York City Tourism and Conventions, the city\u2019s official tourism organization, is expecting a loss of $4 billion this year, caused largely by declining numbers of visitors from Canada, France, Germany and Mexico.\n\u2014 A massive floating swimming pool destined for the East River was deposited in the waters off Port Newark,\nCity &amp; State New York\nreports. The structure, which was paid for in large part by $16 million in public funding, would allow swimmers to swim in filtered river waters. The pilot program is expected to open in summer 2027.\n\u2014\u00a0A newly released federal plan proposes to spend up to $907 million on a floodwall along the Harlem River Drive, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n. The floodwall is part of a larger $1 billion initiative to protect coastal communities from storm surge and rising sea levels caused by climate change. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$24 million\nfor a condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street. The Midtown condo unit at One57 is 4,200 square feet and last sold on the market in 2021 for $19.2 million.\nCompass\u2019\nKyle Blackmon has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$66.3 million\nfor a luxury multifamily property at 56 North Ninth Street. Private equity firm Rockpoint and Lincoln Property Company acquired the Williamsburg multifamily property,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.3 million for Four West 90th Street. The Upper West Side townhouse is 7,800 square feet.\nLeslie J. Garfield\u2019s\nRichard Pretsfelder, Sophie Smadbeck and Morgan Garofalo have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a proposed 18,116-square-foot, five-story residential building at 647 Madison Street in Brooklyn. Robert Bianchini of ARC Architecture + Design Studio is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A multiparcel property in Malibu traded quietly in the off market for $80 million to mark one of the coastal city\u2019s priciest deals this year.\nThe sale of 28719 Grayfox Street was recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office July 29, according to a copy of the deed.\nThe seller is a Wyoming shell company called Surfwatch LLC, which state records show is managed by Wendy Schreiber Fiske. It\u2019s registered to a Santa Barbara address that is owned by Schreiber Fiske and serial entrepreneur Orlo James Fiske, who is the chief technology officer of electrical energy storage tech company Gravity Power, according to documents filed with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.\nThe buyer is PDPG LLC, which has a Longview, Texas mailing address, according to property records.\nA roughly 1,300-square-foot home sits on the 1.4-acre lot, while the other lot is vacant.\nIt was not immediately known what brokerage, if any, was involved in the transaction.\n\nThe Grayfox Street deal is so far the priciest known trade in Malibu this year in what\u2019s shaking out to be a relatively quiet period for the city\u2019s residential market relative to the trades that took place in 2024.\nLast year included the blockbuster purchase of a\nParadise Cove\nproperty by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, for $94 million. Oakley and Red Digital Cinema founder\nJim Jannard\nalso reportedly sold his property on Pacific Coast Highway for $210 million to mark a new high among residential deals in the state.\nStill, with Mailbu\u2019s Grayfox Street deal under its belt, things could be heating up.\nIn June, spec developer\nScott Gillen\nsold 24198 Case Court for $50 million, listing sites show. The property is one of five expansive estates sitting atop its own bluff to comprise the community Gillen named The Case.\nThe end of June also saw\n29130 Cliffside Drive\nin Malibu sell for $49.8 million. The closing price was a discount from the $65 million luxury residential developer TriWest Development had first hoped for when the property hit the market last August.\n",

        "content": "One of the biggest tenants in Chicago\u2019s Willis Tower, law firm ArentFox Schiff, is close to signing a lease renewal that will trim its office footprint by more than 50 percent.\nThe law firm\u2019s cutback adds pressure to Willis Tower\u2019s owner, Blackstone Group, which has worked to preserve the value of the property amid reduced demand, rising interest rates and a massive loan maturity.\nThe law firm is expected to lease just over 75,000 square feet across three floors, down from the more than 168,000 square feet it currently occupies, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The new lease would extend well beyond the current deal\u2019s expiration in July 2028, marking a significant recommitment to the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper despite ongoing challenges in the downtown office market.\nThis downsizing reflects the broader trend of reduction driven by post-COVID shifts in workplace strategy. Remote and hybrid work have prompted companies to reassess their real estate needs, contributing to more than 2.3 million square feet of negative absorption in Chicago\u2019s central business district office market over the past two years.\nThe downtown office vacancy rate has hit record highs every quarter for the past three years, according to brokerage CBRE.\nWhile some professional service firms such as Bain and Sargent &amp; Lundy have expanded their downtown workspace, ArentFox Schiff\u2019s move highlights a continued struggle for landlords as long-term leases signed before the pandemic come up for renewal.\nThe law firm\u2019s downsize comes as separate appraisers take different approaches to how the\nWillis Tower\u2019s 103rd-floor tourist attraction known as the Skydeck\nshould count toward the value of the building, as estimates produced by both the public and private sectors in recent months have ranged from $999 million to $1.4 billion.\n\nEither way, the building is either\nwell below the value of its $1.3 billion mortgage debt\nor just barely treading water, depending on how the Skydeck\u2019s value is incorporated.\nBlackstone acquired the property in 2015 for $1.3 billion and invested an additional $500 million in renovations and retail enhancements. The building was appraised at $1.8 billion during a 2018 refinancing. After securing a loan maturity extension earlier this year, Blackstone now has until March 2030 to restore the tower\u2019s value and recoup its investment.\nThe 110-story skyscraper\u2019s office space was 87 percent leased as of January 2025, with United Airlines as the largest tenant, occupying nearly 666,000 square feet through 2033. Other major tenants include Morgan Stanley and law firm Seyfarth Shaw, both of which have options to reduce their presence in coming years.\nArentFox Schiff was formed in a 2022 merger between Arent Fox and Schiff Hardin and orchestrated by chairman Anthony Lupo. The combined firm reported more than $629 million in revenue last year.\nCBRE\u2019s Mark Cassata, Kyle Kamin and Dan Persa are negotiating the lease on behalf of the law firm, while Telos Group\u2019s Nikki Kern, Jamey Dix and JD Parcheta represent Blackstone at Willis Tower.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "With Austin\u2019s rise as a tech center, affordability has become an issue for homebuyers. But developer ICON hopes to relieve the market pressure by 3D printing houses.\nThe Austin-based builder recently launched its latest project in the city\u2019s Mueller neighborhood, according to\nMySA.com\n. The project put three one-bedroom 3D-printed homes \u2014 each about 650 square feet \u2014 on the market on July 31.\nMore two- and three-bedroom houses will soon go up for sale as part of the Mueller Affordable Homes Program, which aims to make living in Austin more accessible. The program is supported by The Mueller Foundation, which provides affordable housing.\nThe new homes are designed for income-qualifying individuals who make up to 80 percent of area median income. They feature open-layout living, dining and kitchen areas on the first floor, and bedrooms and bathrooms on the second. The developer\u2019s goal is to offer efficient, comfortable housing without compromising on modern design.\n\nThe ICON website features 3D Mueller homes with customized design touches and \u201cblended natural materials.\u201d The company\u2019s appeal to eco-friendly buyers includes the use of low-carbon concrete in the homes. Its technology also includes robotic cranes to layer the concrete in 3D-printed structures.\nThe website did not disclose pricing for the affordable one-bedroom models, but two-bed houses list at $965,000 and three bedrooms cost $1.3 million. The website shows the company has sold seven units in the project.\nMueller, a master-planned community in central Austin, offers access to Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center, Austin Film Studios, The Thinkery museum H-E-B, and the Austin ISD Performing Arts Center. Catellus Development Group is the master developer for the project, with ICON and other companies, including Muskin Builders and David Weekley Homes, active on the site.\nICON\u2019s foray into 3D-printed homes involves more than Mueller. The company also developed the world\u2019s first 3D-printed hotel, El Cosmico in Marfa, and is selling homes in Wimberley Springs and Wolf Ranch in Georgetown.\n",
