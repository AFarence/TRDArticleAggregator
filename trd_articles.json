        "content": "Ketchy Shuby | West Palm Beach\nNew York restaurant Ketchy Shuby will open its first outpost outside of New York in downtown West Palm Beach.\nKetchy Shuby, which also is a nightlife venue, leased 13,100 square feet at the three-story building at 114 South Olive Avenue, according to a news release from the landlord\u2019s broker. The restaurant is a concept by New York hospitality and entertainment mogul Jamie Mulholland.\nBastian Schauer and Mark Rubin were part of the Colliers team that represented the landlord.\u00a0 Mitch Heifetz of Newmark represented the tenant, a limited liability company led by Mulholland.\nKetchy Shuby is expected to open in the fall of next year, the release says.\nAn entity led by Robert J. Trainor Jr., Vicki L. Trainor and Kevin Killerman owns the building, records show. The historic building was completed in 1923 and renovated in 2016, the release says.\nSimpro Group | Miami\nSimpro Group, a firm that uses AI to simplify and power contractor jobs at commercial and residential properties, will open its North America headquarters in downtown Miami.\nSimpro, based in Brisbane, Australia, will open on the 26th floor at the One Downtown office tower at 1 Southeast Third Avenue, with the first employees expected to move in in February, according to the tenant\u2019s news release. The lease is for nearly 4,800 square feet, Simpro confirmed.\nTony Jones of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the tenant, and Cristina Glaria and Harrison Mischel of Tower Commercial Real Estate represented the landlord.\nSimpro, which has other U.S. offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Red Bank, New Jersey, tapped Fred Voccola as its CEO this year. Voccola is the former CEO of Miami-based AI-powered cybersecurity and IT management firm Kaseya.\nHis goal is to scale Simpro\u2019s Miami employment to more than 500 staff members, according to the release. Simpro provides AI software to contractors such as plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and fire safety professionals.\nSimpro will put its company signage at One Downtown as part of its deal.\nLos Angeles-based PCCP bought the 31-story tower, previously called SunTrust International Center, for\n$127 million\nin 2018.\nThe lease gives a boost to Miami officials\u2019 yearslong push to turn the city into a tech mecca. Despite the hype in recent years, with the catchphrase \u201cSilicon Valley South\u201d gaining steam, tech leasing doesn\u2019t represent a significant chunk of\noffice occupancy and demand\n, data shows.\nUniversity of Miami | Miami-Dade County\nThe University of Miami signed a big office lease at the Flagler Station business park.\nCoral Gables-based UM leased 42,000 square feet at Building 1300 at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to the landlord\u2019s news release. The university will use the space for its health care system\u2019s offices that are expected to open in the second quarter.\nNashville, Tennessee-based Hamilton Development bought Building 1300 for\n$20.8 million\nin April, records show.\nLed by Whitfield Hamilton, the firm also acquired the nearby Flagler Station office buildings at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue through a\ndeed-in-lieu of foreclosure\nin September; and the one at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, also through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, in May. Seller Bridge Investment sold the distressed three-property portfolio while facing a foreclosure suit from its lender.\nHamilton Development plans to replace the buildings at 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue with warehouses, but it will keep the office building where UM leased at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue.\nCDM Windows &amp; Door | Doral\nAn impact windows and doors company will move to a bigger industrial space in the Doral area.\nCDM Windows &amp; Doors, an impact glass manufacturer that also installs the systems at commercial and residential properties, leased the entire 40,800-square-foot warehouse at 10405 Northwest 19th Street in Doral, according to a news release from the landlord\u2019s broker.\nThe lease, which starts in February, is an expansion for CDM from its previous space of roughly 27,000 square feet in the Doral submarket, said Michael Hinton, the Lee &amp; Associates broker who represented the landlord in the deal.\nCDM listed its current Doral warehouse at 8301 Northwest 27th Street.\nEmre Tuna, through an affiliate, completed the 10405 Northwest 19th Street building last year on a 2.3-acre site, property records show.\nTortilla Madre | Miami\nMexican restaurant Tortilla Madre opened in Brickell.\nTortilla Madre leased 990 square feet at 28 Southwest 11th Street in a commercial unit at the Millecento condo tower in Miami, according to a news release from FA Commercial.

        "content": "It took until nearly the end of the year, but Santa Monica has a new market leader in 2025.\nA home at 2555 La Mesa Drive sold for just shy of $23 million on Dec. 11, knocking two single-family homes, which each went for $14.6 million, off their perch.\nOn La Mesa Drive, the recent deal was for a 10,317-square-foot home behind private gates, with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, equating to $2,224 per square foot. The property was listed on Aug. 21, with an initial asking price of just under $25 million, according to The Agency\u2019s Amir Jawaherian, who represented the seller, Los Angeles-based developer Peter Bakhitiari of Maison by PGB.\nAfter purchasing the home for $6.5 million in December 2021, Bakhitiari \u201creimagined the property into a super-sustainable modern architectural home that combines strong design, privacy and livability,\u201d Jawaherian said.\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s James Mormile and Kurt Rappaport represented the buyer, which appears to be a trust linked to Nashville consultancy Oberon Solutions.\nThe net-zero estate includes a motor court framed by cascading water walls and a reflecting pool, a resort-style pool, a skylit atrium, expansive walls of glass, a private speakeasy lounge, a state-of-the-art movie theater and private terraces. Included is a detached guest house and private gym as well as a four-car conditioned garage.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. Given that the fourth quarter is incomplete,\nThe Real Deal\nranked the top sales for the first three quarters of the year using Los Angeles County tax assessor data. You can see the top 10 single-family sales in Santa Monica for the first nine months of the year by clicking here.\nIn May, 457 20th Street sold for $14.6 million. At 6,763 square feet, the house went for $2,151 per square foot. Outfitted with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, the house sits on a 8,952-square-foot lot. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate SoCal\u2019s Cynthia Ambuehl and Luca Diamont listed the property. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Marco Salari and Brent Watson represented the buyer.\nThe residence was designed by renowned architect Hagy Belzberg. Called \u201cScreen House\u201d due to its handcrafted, porous facade of custom-molded composite blocks, the fully furnished home has a subterranean courtyard with olive tree, chef-caliber kitchen, entertainment suite, elevator and spa-inspired amenities. The basement boasts a screening room, sauna, steam room and gym. The original asking price, on Jan. 13, was $19.5 million, per Salari.\nThree months earlier,\n628 25th Street\nsold for the same sum, but at a lower price per square foot. At 7,692 square feet, the home with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms went for $1,892 per square foot. Features at 628 25th Street include a floating staircase and an elevator, a formal living room centered around a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, a chef\u2019s kitchen, a butler\u2019s pantry and a temperature-controlled wine fridge. Smith &amp; Berg\u2019s F. Ron Smith and David Berg marketed the property. The Agency\u2019s Jaime Cuevas worked on behalf of the buyer.\n",

        "content": "The siren song of Y\u2019all Street continues to call financial services companies to Uptown Dallas, but 2025 was the year of the suburbs.\nLeases in the satellite cities surrounding Dallas and Fort Worth \u2014 Plano, Frisco, The Colony \u2014 made up eight of the 10 biggest lease deals of the year, allowing the region\u2019s sluggish office market to make some gains toward market recovery.\nVacancy in the region inched down to 25 percent from 25.3 percent in the third quarter, year-over-year, according to a release from Partners Real Estate. Net absorption in the third quarter was positive, too, with the rate surpassing 1 million square feet.\nHere are the biggest office leases of the year, using data from CBRE, Newmark and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nLockheed Martin | 5555 North Beach Street | 455,400 square feet\nThe\ndefense contractor\u2019s lease\nisn\u2019t just the biggest of the year, it\u2019s the largest in a decade, JLL\nsaid\n. Lockheed Martin renewed its 455,400-square-foot lease until August 2031 at Fossil Creek Park, an office campus in north Fort Worth owned by Doug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial. The deal involving the Class B office property, at 5555 North Beach Street, bucks the market trend of flight to quality, with Lockheed staying put in a building constructed in 1996.\nPennyMac | 5025 Plano Parkway | 300,000 square feet\nPennyMac is hopping from one DFW suburb to another. The Los Angeles-based mortgage lender traded its Plano office for a\nfull building lease in Carrollton\n. Pennymac outgrew its 76,000-square-foot lease at the Plano Corporate Center East building, at 2201 West Plano Parkway. It inked a deal to occupy the 300,000-square-foot building at 5025 Plano Parkway, a property that pharmaceutical company AmerisourceBergen put on the sublease market two years ago. Dallas-based Billingsley Company developed the building in 2019 and still owns it. PennyMac will initially occupy 150,000 square feet of the office building and expand to 300,000 square feet. The company\u2019s Carrollton hub will bring in 1,800 new jobs.\nToyota Financial Services | 4401 Cirrus Way | 241,500 square feet\nThe fact that Toyota Financial Services is moving to a timber office building is almost as notable as the fact that the deal is the area\u2019s third-largest office lease of the year. The company signed a lease for the\n242,000-square-foot Offices at Southstone Yards\n, at 4401 Cirrus Way. Crow Holdings developed the seven-story building as part of Southstone Yards, a 45-acre mixed-use development. The office property is also the region\u2019s first timber-framed office building in a century.\nIntegrity Marketing Group | 1445 Ross Avenue | 185,233 square feet\nIt\u2019s not all bad news in downtown Dallas. The urban core has been shedding office users for decades now, but Integrity Marketing Group\u2019s expansion goes against the grain. The insurance provider in 2021 traded its office digs in Cypress Waters for a spot at Fountain Place. Now it\u2019s expanding its space from 100,000 square feet to 185,000 square feet at the downtown tower at 1445 Ross Avenue. It\u2019s owned by Atlanta-based Goddard Investment Group.\nAT&amp;T | 2221 Lakeside Boulevard | 179,700 square feet\nDowntown Dallas office mainstay AT&amp;T has been teasing a\npossible exit\n, citing public safety\nissues in the urban core\n. Rumors are swirling that the telecommunication giant is scouting a suburban office \u2014 but that could also be an effort to get a bigger incentive\nboost from the city\nto stay. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T\nincreased its presence in Richardson\nwith a 186,000-square-foot lease at Lakeside Boulevard Tower, at 2221 Lakeside Boulevard. The expansion reflects AT&amp;T\u2019s consolidation of regional offices at the RIchardson outpost. The 807,000-square-foot building is owned by Dallas-based Provident Realty Advisors, which plans to invest nearly $16 million in upgrades.\nGeico | 2375 North Glenville Drive | 165,107 square feet\nIn another win for Richardson, Geico\ndoubled its office space\nin the Dallas suburb. Mapletree Investments owns the Galatyn Commons complex where the insurer signed a 165,000-square-foot lease. Singapore-based Mapletree bought the building at 2375 North Glenville Drive in 2022. Geico also occupies 233,000 square feet at the former Fossil headquarters, at 2280 North Greenville Avenue.\nWeWork/Amazon | 6535 North State Highway 161 | 154,600 square feet\nAmazon partnered with WeWork to take over a McKesson-owned property in Irving. The partners leased 154,600 square feet at 6535 North State Highway 161. The 272,000-square-foot office building was constructed in 2001 and has six stories.\nSally Beauty | 7900 Windrose Avenue | 144,517 square feet\nSally Beauty reportedly turned down incentives from the city of Denton to keep its headquarters in the city and\nhopped over to Plano\n. The Fortune 1000 beauty retailer inked a deal to move 600 employees into a 140,000-square-foot space in Liberty Mutual\u2019s office building at Legacy West after 40 years in Denton. The new space at 7900 Windrose Avenue represents a downsizing from the company\u2019s previous space, a 200,000-square-foot building at 3001 Colorado Boulevard.\nScotiabank | 2601 Victory Avenue | 133,700 square feet\nCanadian lender Scotiabank was considering planting a U.S. office in Charlotte, but ultimately\nchose Dallas\nin what\u2019s shaping up to be a win for the rise of Y\u2019all Street. The city of Dallas offered Scotiabank nearly $5 million in incentives to come to the Big D. Scotiabank signed a lease to occupy 100,000 square feet at Hillwood\u2019s Victory Commons One, at 2601 Victory Avenue in Uptown Dallas.\nEnergy Transfer | 8020 Park Lane | 120,923 square feet\nIn the same year that Rick Perry\u2019s Energy Transfer took Greenpeace to court, it inked a lease at an office building within The Shops at Park Lane. The energy company took 121,000 square feet at the five-story office building at 8020 Park Lane. It was built in 2015 and is owned by Northwood Investors.\n",

        "content": "Where one coworking space has retreated, another is moving in.\nJack and Juda Srour\u2019s Jay Suites is opening its first Brooklyn location at 41 Flatbush Avenue, where Fort Greene meets Downtown Brooklyn. It\u2019s taking over 30,000 square feet on the second floor of the Pioneer Building, previously occupied by coworking competitor Regus.\nIt\u2019s one vote of confidence in the borough\u2019s coworking market and the idea that white-collar Brooklynites are willing to pay for office space near them.\nJuda Srour said he expects workers from the area\u2019s new residential towers to become customers.\n\u201cThe entire area is really changing with all these brand new developments,\u201d Srour said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to work in the area because they live in the area,\u201d he said of residents.\nThe space will feature 65 private office units, four meeting rooms and access to a building roof deck. Other tenants in the building include Blick Art Materials and UPS, according to the building\u2019s website. The building is owned by Quinlan Development Group, according to its website. The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe outerborough office market has failed to have a Manhattan-style comeback. The private sector in particular has stayed away from Brooklyn and Queens: A majority of 2025\u2019s\ntop office leases in the boroughs\nwere government agencies and schools.\nAnd Jay Suites has also stuck close to the city\u2019s center, with its previous 12 locations in Manhattan.\nBut coworking relies on different dynamics, hoping to capture white-collar remote workers who want to get out of the house but still stay local.\nJay Suites typically leases its space but has also dabbled in purchasing. In 2024, the company\npaid $35 million\nfor the Class B,142,000-square-foot office building at 8 West 38th Street, according to property records. The price for the 12-story, 1913 building came out to about $250 per square foot.\nIn addition to Jay Suites, the company also operates Jay Conference locations for meetings and events. Srour said leadership hopes to open a conference location in Brooklyn as well.\n\u201cThe goal would be to build a hub,\u201d he said.",

Apollo Global Management, JPMorgan Chase and Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital provided the financing.\nAdditionally, InterVest and Metro Loft extended a previous loan on the project, bringing the total financing for the development up to $867 million.\nThe financing is divided between a $700 million senior loan and $167 million in mezzanine debt, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Dustin Stolly, Aaron Appel and Adam Schwartz arranged the historic financing.\nLast year, Metro Loft and InterVest\nreached an agreement\nto convert the 1.2-million-square-foot office building into thousands of residential units.\nInterVest bought the office building in 2019 with Nightingale Properties for $175 million, but faced foreclosure from lender Oaktree Capital Management in 2023 before the pivot to a conversion led Oaktree to call off the dogs.\nThe redevelopment will see the partners tack five floors onto the existing 24-story structure and renovate the lobby. There will be a total of 1,568 units, approximately 25 percent of which will be set aside for those earning an average of 80 percent of the area median income.\nThe project will also include a plethora of amenities, including a spa, golf simulator, rooftop basketball and padel courts.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s City Council overruled Mayor Brandon Johnson in dramatic fashion on Saturday, approving a 2026 budget that scraps his proposed corporate head tax and commits more cash to the city\u2019s deeply underfunded pension systems.\nThe 30-18 vote capped weeks of infighting and marked a rare power grab by a coalition of mostly moderate and conservative aldermen, who wrested control of the budget process from the mayor\u2019s office, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Their plan removes Johnson\u2019s $33-per-employee monthly head tax on large companies with 500 or more employees, and accelerates pension payments in hopes of shoring up the city\u2019s balance sheet and avoiding another credit downgrade.\nThe tax, based on one\nenacted in 1973\nand eliminated under Rahm Emanuel in 2014, charged companies with 50 employees or more $4 per worker per month at the time, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, as well as the Institute for the Public Good, which produced a policy paper in September in support of the proposal.\nThe concept was derided by the city\u2019s business community as an\nanti-growth penalty\n. The Illinois Policy Institute came out against the head tax, as did the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this summer.\nWhile the budget could still be tweaked later this year or into 2026, the message was clear: Any changes will now flow through the City Council, not the mayor\u2019s office. Alderman Pat Dowell, the 3rd Ward Democrat who backed the plan, called it a \u201cliving document\u201d that can be amended as needed.\nJohnson floated the possibility of a line item veto, though he\u2019s sent mixed signals. Overriding a veto would require 34 votes \u2014 a threshold the Council bloc doesn\u2019t yet have but believes it can reach. Alderman Gilbert Villegas warned that a veto would equate to a shut down, arguing some holdouts would back the budget rather than risk starting the year without one.\nThe death of the head tax spares large office users and employers a new levy, a key concern as downtown vacancies remain elevated. But the budget also includes higher taxes on rideshare trips and alcohol sales, and most notably, a jump in the city\u2019s\nlease tax\nto 15 percent from 11 percent.\nThat tax hits a broad swath of activity, from cloud computing contracts to construction equipment rentals, adding costs for developers, owners and tenants alike.\nJohnson\nblasted the Council plan as fiscally shaky, arguing it relies on overestimated revenues, legally questionable taxes and unworkable spending cuts that could blow a $176 million hole midyear. He also sharply criticized a plan to sell off delinquent city debt to private collectors, a move he said would disproportionately hit low-income residents.\nEven without a veto, the fight isn\u2019t over. Johnson and his allies could push amendments before year-end, while aldermen are already eyeing Springfield to petition for expanded taxing authority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An Upper East Side co-op, trading hands for the first time in decades, led Manhattan\u2019s luxury market this week.\nThe duplex apartment at 980 Fifth Avenue, asking $16.2 million, was the priciest of 21 homes in the borough asking $4 million or more to find buyers between Dec. 15 and Dec. 21, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report.\nThe total was down from the 33 deals inked in the\nprevious period\n, though it was still a strong showing for mid-December, when activity typically slows as the holidays approach.\nUnit 24/25A hit the market in September. It\u2019s unclear when the apartment last traded, though a Streeteasy listing description for the property noted it\u2019s been several decades.\nThe co-op spans more than 4,400 square feet and has four bedrooms, six bathrooms and a staff room. It also features views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nAmenities in the 45-residence building include a rooftop deck, full-time doormen, a porte-cochere and garage.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Kathy Sloane and Sami Hassoumi had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was a townhouse attached to 40 East End Avenue, a 29-unit project\ndeveloped by Lightstone\n. The townhouse, also called a maisonette, last asked $9.7 million, down from its $10 million price tag when it hit the market in 2020.\nThe triplex home spans 4,900 square feet and has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and an elevator. It also features a private street entrance and a garden.\nAmenities in the building, built in 2019, include a fitness center, library and catering kitchen. The 17-story condominium was designed by TenBerke Architects\u2019 Deborah Berke, who is the dean of the Yale School of Architecture.\nA team with the Corcoran Group heads sales at the project, which launched in 2018. The sponsor is still searching for a buyer for a penthouse at the building, now asking just under $10 million after hitting the market for $10.6 million seven years ago.\nOf the 21 properties, 12 were condos, six were co-ops, two were condos and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes asked a combined $137 million, which works out to an average price of $6.5 million and a median of $5.5 million. The typical home was on the market for nearly two years and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

Property records show San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners sold the nearly 1-acre complex.\nThe trade breaks down to about $330,000 per room, or about $430 per square foot. The price includes furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nThe deal is a return to Miami Beach for Le Guennec, who\nbought and sold\na smaller Washington Avenue hotel years ago. Le Guennec owns a collection of 10 hotels in Paris. He plans to brand and manage the Angler\u2019s himself eventually, said commercial agent\nSusan Gale\nof Gale International at One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Gale represented the buyer in the latest sale, alongside attorney Chad Freedman of Ballaga, Freedman &amp; Atkins.\nAlex Lalos of Hodges Ward Elliott represented the seller.\nThe Angler\u2019s includes two pools, three food and beverage outlets, an underground parking garage, 2.400 square feet of retail event space, and 1,100 square feet of meeting space, Gale said. The property sold in 2013 for $5.4 million. The previous owners built a five-story addition in 2018.\nThe buyer, who financed the purchase with 50 percent financing, plans to spend millions of dollars to renovate the property. The original structure was built in 1923 and 1930.\nGale said the deal was \u201cvery competitive\u201d and is indicative of an increase in demand for hotels. She\u2019s seeing more prospective buyers from Europe.\nPrior to this deal, \u201cthere haven\u2019t been that many sales,\u201d Gale said. Many hotel sellers haven\u2019t been realistic about pricing, she added.\nThe priciest sale of an operating hotel \u2014 not for redevelopment \u2014 in Miami-Dade County this year was the $300 million trade of East Miami at Brickell City Center. Trinity Investments and Certares sold the 352-key hotel to Blackstone. The deed was\nrecorded at $147.8 million\n, which likely excluded what Blackstone paid for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\n",

The firm, led by Salim and Kamil Chraibi, has a spate of workforce housing projects at stages from proposal to development in south Miami-Dade.\nIts latest pitches are in unincorporated Miami-Dade, according to separate pre-applications filed to the county last week.\nOne is a complex with 100 townhomes, with at least 20 of them for sale at workforce prices, on a 7.7-acre site on the northeast corner of Southwest 226th Street and Southwest 130th Avenue.\nThe other is a complex with 63 townhomes, with at least 20 percent for sale at workforce prices, on a 4.5-acre site at 24425 Southwest 127th Avenue in the Naranja expansion area.\nDevelopers can request pre-application meetings to gauge county departments\u2019 input on proposed projects and tweak plans before submitting official applications. PPK Architects designed both projects.\nMiami-based\nBluenest\nhas completed about 1,000 homes and has a pipeline of another 3,000, mostly in the south county area.

This will be a market-rate project, with Bluenest planning to designate some of the units for Miami Gardens city employees at workforce prices.\n",

The real work is set to begin.\nCity Council gave final approval last week to Totem\u2019s plans for a two-acre site surrounding the Broadway Junction transportation hub in Brooklyn, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Construction is expected to begin early next year.\nThe project, known as\nHerkimer-Williams\n, has been in the making since 2021. That\u2019s when Totem, led by Vivian Liao and Tucker Reed, filed preliminary plans for the site. Since then, hundreds of meetings with residents and stakeholders yielded changes, including reducing the maximum height of the buildings from 405 feet to 345 feet.\nThe \u201cvote by the City Council marks a historic milestone not just for Herkimer-Williams, but for the future of East New York,\u201d Liao said in a statement.\nThe development is slated to include almost 1,000 affordable housing units, an increase from the roughly 600 proposed earlier. There will also be 25,000 square feet of public open space, 85,000 square feet of community facility space \u2014 to be anchored by a higher education institution \u2014 114,000 square feet of retail space, 440,000 square feet of commercial space and 100,000 square feet of industrial space.\nThe 10-year development plan is expected to unfold in four phases. The first phase will include the public space and roughly 200 of the affordable units.\nThe project falls outside of the borders of the controversial East New York rezoning, hence Totem\u2019s need for its own rezoning. The wider rezoning has yet to\npan out\nand has fallen short of expected housing goals.\nMeanwhile, roughly $500 million in city and state funding was recently announced for Broadway Junction to improve accessibility, safety and open space, an eye towards unlocking the potential of the area.\nElsewhere in East New York, Gotham Organization, Monadnock Development and nonprofit Christian Cultural Center\nscored a $315 million loan\nin April for their project at 12020 Flatlands Avenue. The loan will fund the construction of 453 rental units at the site, which used to be a vacant parking lot at the church\u2019s 10-and-a-half-acre Brooklyn campus.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A 25-year-old developer is making a bold move on North Texas\u2019 northward march, aiming to complete a 1,300-home master-planned community in\nPilot Point\n, a small but fast-rising city halfway between Dallas and the Oklahoma border.\nCameron Castaldo, founder of One Mark Advisors, closed on 363 acres for $27 million earlier this month and plans to transform the site into Maverick Farms, a sprawling neighborhood with roughly 1,348 homes, trails, a lake-style water feature and two amenity centers,\naccording\nto the Dallas Business Journal. His firm purchased the land, at 12255 Mustang Road, from Ari-Tex Electric on Nov. 4.\nCastaldo entered real estate as a teenager, skipped college, built capital through residential and land sales and launched One Mark Advisors in 2023.\nThe project will roll out in four phases over the next decade, with full buildout targeted for mid-2036. Castaldo broke ground in November and expects to deliver the first 539 finished lots to homebuilders by the end of 2026. CastleRock Communities,\nMattamy Homes\nand David Weekley Homes are signed on for the first phase, with marketing underway for a fourth builder next year, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\nHomes will sit on 40-, 50- and 60-foot lots, with floor plans ranging from about 1,600 square feet to 4,000 square feet. Entry-level pricing is expected to start at about $280,000, the publication reported, undercutting Pilot Point\u2019s average home value of roughly $338,000, according to Zillow, and reinforcing the area\u2019s appeal to buyers priced out of closer-in suburbs.\nTotal development costs are projected at $90 million to $95 million, with Castaldo pegging the community\u2019s full buildout value at about $548 million. Trez Capital provided acquisition and development financing, while KFM Engineering &amp; Design is serving as development consultant and engineer, according to the Dallas Business Journal. Lenart Development is the general contractor.\nBeyond homes and amenities, Maverick Farms will include a regional wastewater treatment plant designed to support future growth north of the site, a piece of infrastructure that could make the project a catalyst for additional development.\nPilot Point, with a population of about 6,800, sits near some of the Metroplex\u2019s hottest growth corridors. Celina, just to the southeast, has ranked among the nation\u2019s fastest-growing cities, while\nSherman\nto the north is seeing a multibillion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing boom. Other developers and retailers, including Green Brick Partners,\nCenturion American\nand H-E-B, have already planted flags nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final price is $10 million lower than the condo\u2019s last asking price when it\nsnagged a signed contract\nin August 2024. It\u2019s also significantly less than the $70 million it sought when the developers launched sales in 2013.\nThe condo spans the 42nd and 43rd floors and has four bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two staff rooms. It also features a terrace, views of the East River and a 33-foot swimming pool.\nA team with Zeckendorf Marketing led sales at the building, while Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jessica Levine brought the buyer.\nSpokespeople for the developers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Levine declined to comment on the sale.\nWilliam and Arthur Zeckendorf bought the site for $160 million in 2007, though construction on the 88-unit building\nstalled for years\nafter the sale due to the Great Recession. The tower, designed by Foster + Partners, was completed in 2015. It includes amenities such as a fitness center, pool and children\u2019s playroom.\nThe developers initially targeted a sellout above $710 million, but by 2020, that was lowered to around $640 million. At the time, the city was\nsaturated with new development condos\n, leaving many to languish on the market while others remained unlisted and vacant.\nThe building, across the street from the United Nations\u2019 Visitors Services wing and just a few blocks away from its headquarters, has attracted a number of diplomats and foreign dignitaries.\nIn 2020, the nation of Kuwait dropped\n$16.1 million\non an apartment at the building to serve as the private residence of the country\u2019s New York-based consul general, Hamad Al-Hazeem. The year prior, the British Consulate-General in New York also paid about\n$16 million\nfor a condo on the 38th floor, while the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar shelled out\n$45 million\nfor four units in 2015.\nOther notable buyers at the tower include the former president of Kohl\u2019s, Jay Baker, and his wife, Pat, who bought a penthouse on the 39th floor in 2019. The couple paid\n$16 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Southampton is trying to rebalance the Hamptons housing map and it\u2019s starting east of the Shinnecock Canal.\nThe town board this month unanimously approved an affordable housing overlay district designed to push workforce housing into the area\u2019s most expensive enclaves, where sky-high home prices have long priced out the year-round labor force. The move creates a pathway for small- to mid-sized affordable projects in places that have historically been off-limits, Newsday\nreported\n.\nThe overlay allows developments with 10 to 35 affordable units on parcels zoned for business or single-family use, provided they receive subsidies from the town\u2019s Community Housing Fund.\nThe overlay is discretionary, meaning projects must be approved case by case by the town board, but officials say it is meant to speed along proposals that would otherwise be tangled up in zoning or never built at all.\nSeveral hamlets east of the canal rank among the nation\u2019s most expensive housing markets, while roughly half of Southampton\u2019s homes are seasonal, according to a town housing study. Much of the town\u2019s existing affordable stock has been clustered west of the canal, forcing workers to commute east along already clogged corridors like County Road 39.\nTown leaders hope the zoning tweak will shift that pattern. Planning officials cited Sandy Hollow Cove Apartments, a 28-unit complex in Tuckahoe designed to resemble a manor-style residence, as a template for how denser projects can blend into high-end surroundings.\nProjects approved under the overlay must sit on parcels as small as 60,000 square feet \u2014 a sharp reduction from the prior 220,000-square-foot minimum \u2014 though developments along County Road 39 are excluded from overlay consideration.\nThe zoning change dovetails with Southampton\u2019s CHF, a half-percent real estate transfer tax approved by voters in 2022. Since launching in 2023, the fund has generated $39 million, $27.5 million of which has already been spent or committed, according to the town.\nSeveral projects east of the canal \u2014 totaling 58 units across Tuckahoe, Water Mill, Shinnecock Hills and North Sea \u2014 are already lined up for funding but still need overlay approval to proceed.\nNot everyone is sold: some residents warned that higher density could worsen traffic and erode community character, especially near the canal. Town officials counter that most applicants are existing East End residents or workers who were priced out and want to return.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

More than 100 employees are expected to make the move with Empire to its forthcoming Financial District hub.\nThe local record label, distribution and publishing firm led by Ghazi Shami purchased the building from Affinius Capital at the beginning of the year for\n$24.5 million\n. The company plans to invest another $40 million in the property.\nApproval from the Planning Commission almost didn\u2019t arrive due to a debate over privately owned public rooftop space.\nEmpire wanted to close the space as a security precaution, offering three public concerts a year as a carrot. That didn\u2019t sway the commission, which was deadlocked at 3-3 after a first vote.\nBut a majority shifted in favor after Empire tacked on another public concert to its promise. It also removed the ability to opt out of the promise with a fee payment.\n\u201cI believe this project, when finished, will go a long way to not just reactivate but revitalize downtown as we know it,\u201d Commissioner Sean McGarry said after the approval.\nThe storied building has a troubled recent history.\nRedco Development and Boston-based AEW Capital Management bought the 100,000-square-foot office building in 2019 for $84 million. The price for the now\ncentury-old landmark\ncame out to $840 per square foot.\nIn March 2023, however, Redco and AEW\nwalked away from the two\u2013story building\nafter failing to make their mortgage payments on a $65 million loan. They gave the keys of the vacant building to lender Square Mile Capital, now known as Affinius Capital.\nEmpire will use office space on the basement and second floor of the building. In addition to the office space, Empire is planning to open a restaurant in one of the banking halls, while the other will mostly be utilized for private use.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "With a little more than a week\nleft in office\n, the Adams administration released recommendations for ramping up housing construction in Manhattan.\nThe mayor\u2019s office on Monday released the\nso-called Manhattan Plan\n, laying out six \u201ckey themes\u201d for increasing housing construction in Manhattan.\nThose themes include building near transit and job centers, upzoning mid-density districts to allow more housing, building on government-owned sites, encouraging development on vacant or underutilized private sites, streamlining approval processes and exploring new models of housing.\nMayor Eric Adams first announced the\nManhattan Plan\nduring his State of the City address in January. At the time, he said the plan would add 100,000 units of housing to Manhattan over the next decade.\nThat number, however, is a target and not a reflection of how many units could be created if future administrations follow the plan\u2019s recommendations. Already-approved initiatives, including the Midtown South rezoning and a portion of the 80,000 units made possible by the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity text amendment\n, are also baked into that unit count. The administration doesn\u2019t have an estimate of how many units could be built for each of the plan\u2019s recommendations.\nThe plan recommends looking at housing opportunities near the Second Avenue subway, noting that the second phase of the project will extend to 125th Street, much of which is within a special district that has height and density limits that restrict development.\n\u201cOver the past decade, despite strong community advocacy, much of the corridor\u2019s development potential remains unrealized,\u201d the report states.\nIt suggests upzoning parts of Community Board 6, which includes Manhattan east of Lexington Avenue from 14th to 59th Streets. The\nboard\nhas pushed the administration to help it craft a housing plan. This could include mapping R11 and R12 districts, which respectively allow buildings that are 15 and 18 times the size of the lot on which they rise.\nThe plan additionally points to special districts, industrial zones and historic districts as opportunities to ease zoning restrictions and allow more housing.\nThe administration also floats rebuilding Manhattan\u2019s bulkheads and hardening the shoreline to allow more waterfront development. More extensive land reclamation to extend the borough\u2019s shoreline would require changes to federal law, however.\nThe plan also calls for further study of how to incentivize development on long-vacant or under-utilized sites. It highlights Soloviev Group\u2019s site on First Avenue between East 38th and East 41st streets, which is Manhattan\u2019s largest vacant site. The developer proposed a\ncasino\nfor the property, which has been vacant since 2007, but the proposal was\nrejected\n. The firm hasn\u2019t announced what it now plans for the site, but executives have indicated that they do not plan to let the property sit vacant.\nThe report further recommends that the city work with the state to reform environmental review and allow more shared housing options, including\nsingle-room occupancy units\n.\nIt is not unusual for planning initiatives to span multiple administrations. To what extent Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani picks the plan\u2019s strategies remains to be seen, but he has said\nthat he supports building more housing in areas that have \u201chistorically not contributed to citywide housing goals.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A fire-scarred commercial property along Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades could soon get a mixed-use reset, as developers begin to test how far Los Angeles\u2019 post-wildfire rebuilding push can go beyond single-family homes.\nKeyes Real Estate filed plans to redevelop 15113 West Sunset Boulevard with a\nthree-story building\nfeaturing six apartments atop roughly 2,500 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to Urbanize Los Angeles. The site has sat vacant since the Palisades wildfire in January, which along with the Eaton fire damaged or destroyed billions of dollars of property damage.\nThe proposal calls for a contemporary low-rise structure designed by\nDesignARC\n, with a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom units stacked above retail space fronting Sunset. Parking would be tucked behind the building using mechanical lifts, a common workaround in space-constrained infill projects.\nTo unlock additional density beyond what zoning would normally allow, Keyes is seeking incentives under the city\u2019s density bonus program. In exchange, one of the six apartments would be reserved for a very low-income household \u2014 a modest affordability component, but one that reflects the city\u2019s push to pair recovery with housing production.\nThe project will require approval from the city planning commission and lands amid heightened scrutiny of post-fire cleanup and redevelopment in the\nPalisades\n. Earlier this month, the city council targeted the last 11 parcels that had not completed debris removal, signaling a tougher stance after repeated notices to property owners.\nAt the same time, Mayor Karen Bass has been rolling out a series of\nemergency orders\naimed at speeding reconstruction. Emergency Executive Order 10, issued in October, streamlined permitting for commercial and business properties damaged in the fire, extended land-use entitlements and allowed licensed architects and engineers to self-certify certain code and site conditions. That followed an earlier July order focused on expediting residential rebuilding.\nBass has also floated financial relief, including calling for exemptions from Measure ULA \u2014 the city\u2019s so-called\nmansion tax\non sales over $5 million \u2014 for Palisades homeowners affected by the fires, a move closely watched by brokers and owners in the luxury-heavy enclave.\nCity data suggests the fast-track approach is having an impact. Rebuilding permits for single-family homes in Pacific Palisades are now being approved nearly three times faster than before the fires. As of Dec. 22, Los Angeles had approved more than 1,670 rebuilding plans and issued 1,354 permits covering 644 addresses, according to the city\u2019s rebuilding dashboard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A buyer signed a contract to purchase a waterfront Coconut Grove estate that was previously asking $135 million, and is now on the market for $115 million.\nThe pending deal marks the most expensive of 19 contracts signed in Miami-Dade County between Dec. 15 and Dec. 21, according to the latest Eklund-Gomes report. It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 104 days on the market, on average.\nForty-five luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,313 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed 20 contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $259.3 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 11 single-family homes and eight condos under contract last week totals $305 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $20.4 million and spent an average of 73 days on the market. They total nearly $224 million in asking dollar volume.\nAt the top is\nBanyan Ridge\n, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way in Miami. It\u2019s listed with Danny Hertzberg, Jill Hertzberg, Nathan and Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker. The seller is the estate of the late prominent Miami restaurateur Jonathan Lewis, and the sale is expected to surpass a recent $100 million-plus lot deal in Coconut Grove by billionaire Jorge Mas. Lewis\u2019 father was Peter B. Lewis, the former chairman and CEO of Progressive Insurance Company.\nThe property includes a 4,100-square-foot, three-bedroom house that was built for former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan; and a 5,300-square-foot, four-bedroom home built for Peter Lewis.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $10.1 million and spent 147 days on the market, on average. They total $81.2 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,525 per square foot.\nAndrew Zaro\u2019s purchase of a lower penthouse at Palazzo Del Sol on Fisher Island topped the condo component of the report. The sale was recorded on the Multiple Listing Service at $36 million, which included furniture, but the deed was recorded for\njust over $35 million\n. The sale marks the priciest condo trade on Fisher Island this year. Zaro is a member of the family behind Zaro\u2019s Bakery in New York.\nThe 9,800-square-foot seven-bedroom unit traded between $3,600 per square foot and nearly $3,800 per square foot. Pierre Brondeau, executive chairman of FMC Corp., a Philadelphia-based agricultural sciences company, and his wife Melissa Brondeau sold the lower penthouse. Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty represented the sellers in their latest deal. Jorge Escasena of Luxury Living Realty \u2014 unrelated to Puig\u2019s firm \u2014 represented the buyer.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 21 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $137.3 million, and the typical home spent 639 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Weeks after closing on Chicago\u2019s priciest multifamily sale in more than two years, a California investor is back in the market \u2014 scooping up another tower a couple of blocks away.\nAn affiliate of San Francisco\u2013based FPA Multifamily paid $89 million for a 263-unit apartment tower at 420 East Ohio Street in Streeterville, according to property records. The deal comes in at roughly $338,400 per unit, and is just two blocks from\nNorth Water Apartments\n, the 398-unit residential portion of the 50-story tower at 340 East North Water Street that FPA bought in November for nearly $175 million, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThat earlier acquisition marked the highest-priced multifamily sale in Chicago since August 2023. Together, the two deals signal a confident bet on Streeterville, a downtown submarket bounded by the Magnificent Mile, Lake Michigan and the Chicago River that has held up better than many other areas through the recent market slowdown, according to CoStar.\nThe Ohio Street tower traded well below its last peak valuation. Portland-based Green Cities, then operating as\nGerding Edlen\n, bought the 41-story building in 2016 for $109 million, during the last cycle\u2019s pricing highs. Like many owners facing higher borrowing costs and a shifting capital markets landscape, Green Cities opted to test the waters as debt maturities loomed, the outlet reported.\nThe property hit the market in June, represented by CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Pete Marino. At the time, it was less than 3 percent vacant, and marketing materials pitched an opportunity to upgrade units and amenities \u2014 including the pool deck \u2014 to further push rents.\nDespite price resets on individual buildings, momentum has returned to Chicago\u2019s multifamily investment market. Through most of 2025,\napartment rents\nin the city have outpaced gains in many major U.S. markets, helping coax buyers off the sidelines. Including the Ohio Street deal, investors have poured roughly $4.8 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties this year, already surpassing 2024\u2019s full-year total of $3.9 billion, and marking the strongest volume since $5.9 billion traded in 2022, according to CoStar data.\nFPA has been one of the more active players. Earlier this year, the firm sold a 604-unit complex in\nNaperville\nfor $136 million, the highest-priced suburban multifamily sale of 2025. Last year, it paid $144 million for a 500-unit South Loop tower now branded Arrive Michigan Avenue.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Yet, the city hit another milestone it hasn\u2019t reached in more than a decade.\nYear-over-year office vacancy fell by three points to 33.5 percent as of December, the most significant vacancy decline since 2011, when the country\u2019s economy was crawling out of the Great Recession, according to the same CBRE report.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, the city\u2019s commercial real estate market\nhas risen atop the artificial intelligence tide\n. AI companies leased 2.5 million square feet in 2025, and now fill 7 million square feet of office space in the city, roughly 12 percent of San Francisco\u2019s total occupied space.\nOffice leasing demand\nhas also hit an all-time high, according to CBRE, with tenants in the market seeking about 8 million square feet of office space \u2014 AI companies accounted for 2.8 million square feet of this demand, or 35 percent.\nThe office demand could lead to new development in 2026. Colin Yasukochi, head of CBRE\u2019s tech division, told\nSan Francisco Business Times\nthat as high-quality office supply becomes tighter, tenants in the market may look to partner on new development.\n\u201cSome of these companies may be in the market because they want to consolidate into a new development of some kind,\u201d Yasukochi told the outlet. \u201cBecause right now, many of them are trying to assemble large nearby blocks of space, and for many of them, that isn\u2019t quite as easy as it sounds.\u201d\nOffice development has suffered a dry spell in San Francisco, during which no office towers or downtown developments have broken ground in more than five years.\nHowever, Yasukochi told the Business Times he doesn\u2019t expect AI companies to lead the push for new office development.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be tech or AI, but a lot of the more traditional financial services companies that want to expand and refresh their space,\u201d he said to the outlet. \u201cThey have been the ones that have traditionally gone to these types of developments.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s overall vacancy rate glosses over the waning availability of trophy office space, which\nsits at 15 percent\n, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

        "content": "A long-vacant downtown San Antonio hospital tower is inching closer to an apartment makeover, as a key approval gives its developer fresh momentum \u2014 and potential tax savings \u2014 after years of starts and stops.\nThe 23-story Nix building at 414 Navarro Street won a historic tax certification last week from the San Antonio Historic and Design Review Commission, clearing an early hurdle for Houston-based Innjoy Hospitality\u2019s plan to convert the nearly century-old structure into 329 apartments with ground-floor retail. The HDRC approved the measure unanimously through its consent agenda, according to city records and first\nreported\nby the San Antonio Business Journal.\nThe certification positions Innjoy to pursue state and federal historic tax credits through the Texas Historical Commission and the National Park Service. HDRC had already given conceptual approval to the\nproject in August\n, though the development will need a certificate of appropriateness before construction can begin if any changes are proposed to the 94-year-old building.\nThe\nproject\nalso comes with local tax relief. With sign-off from the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, the redeveloped property would avoid ad valorem taxes for five years after renovations are completed. Beginning in year six, the building would be reappraised and taxed at 50 percent of its market value on a rolling five-year basis under the city\u2019s Unified Development Code.\nDetails tied to the historic tax credit application shed new light on the scope and timing. Innjoy plans to carve the ground floor into four retail spaces, while upper floors would be reconfigured into a mix of studios and one-, two- and three-bedroom units. The development team expects to break ground in January and wrap construction in 2028. XA Collective Architecture + Planning, HM3 Engineering and A-1 Engineering are part of the design and engineering team.\nInnjoy bought the 300,000-plus-square-foot tower in 2020, a year after Nix Health shuttered operations in the building. The property sits near the River Walk and has remained mostly empty since the hospital\u2019s closure, making it one of the most visible symbols of downtown\u2019s post-pandemic vacancy problem. Landry\u2019s continues to operate restaurant space at the river level.\nThe developer initially floated a\nhotel\nconversion, but pivoted to\nmultifamily\nas market conditions shifted. A state filing in late 2023 projected a construction start in early 2025, a timeline that slipped as financing and approvals lagged.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Besides last names, what do City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Eric Adams have in common?\nBoth of their tenures began in promising fashion for the real estate industry, only to be tarnished at the end \u2014 albeit in entirely different ways.\nThe speaker\u2019s flameout was nowhere near as dramatic as the mayor\u2019s, and it involved not corruption but screwing the real estate industry \u2014 and housing-starved New Yorkers.\nMore drama lies ahead, assuming the mayor\nvetoes\nthe Community Opportunity to Purchase Act and perhaps the\nConstruction Justice Act\nand affordable housing bill\nIntro 1443-A\nas well. A COPA veto would likely not be overridden.\nAdrienne Adams\u2019 speakership began with a\ngroundbreaking statement\nto the New York Times: \u201cI reject that this will be a Council that says no to housing, given the scale of the crisis we face.\u201d For three years, she kept that promise by pushing through\nspot\n,\nneighborhood\nand\ncitywide\nrezonings.\nThat was big, because the mayor\u2019s indictment and bromance with President Donald Trump had left him without the political capital to do any heavy lifting.\nBut this fall, the speaker tarnished her housing legacy by trying to get voters to reject City Charter revisions that will make it easier to build housing, especially in districts that have allowed very few new units.\nI get that she was defending the Council\u2019s power, but the measures \u2014 which passed \u2014 will advance her own fair-housing goals. And she funded her campaign against them with taxpayer money, which was legally questionable at best.\nThen came last week\u2019s votes. COPA was weakened by amendments, but would still require a new, unwieldy bureaucracy at the city\u2019s already overburdened housing agency to enforce a law that would hamstring multifamily sales.\nAnd to what benefit? Its own sponsor, Council member Sandy Nurse, admitted that COPA would create only a \u201ctiny chance\u201d for buildings to be purchased by capable nonprofits.\nThe Construction Justice Act, for its part, will raise the cost of affordable housing, which already is\nmuch more expensive\nto build than market-rate. That will result in fewer units. So will Intro 1443-A, which mandates even lower rents and tenant incomes in city-funded housing, and another bill requiring such developments to have\nmore bedrooms\n.\nTo review: In a span of three months, the speaker fought City Charter revisions and passed COPA and three bills slashing affordable housing production. Fewer homes, more bureaucracy. That\u2019s a helluva way to go out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Southampton\u2019s\nnew overlay district\nreally lead to more affordable housing, given that projects will still have to endure a public hearing (where locals will yell \u201cnot in my back yard!\u201d) and need individual approval by the town board? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Asked who will be a rising star in 2026, Partnership for New York City\u2019s Kathy Wylde named NYSAFAH\u2019s recently hired\nCarlina Rivera\n, \u201cbecause she is going to bring\nunprecedented political savvy\nto the affordable housing industry.\u201d NYSAFAH, which represents affordable housing providers, is known more for industry expertise than for legislative influence.\nElsewhere\u2026\nHeatherwood, a Long Island builder that was\nbetrayed\nby the Town of Hempstead a year ago on a transit-oriented development, just got some good news from the Hochul administration about another project on the peninsula.\nThe state picked Douglas Patrick\u2019s firm to\nbuild 495 homes\non state-owned land in East Farmingdale. The 13-acre property has been \u201cvacant and blighted\u201d for decades, according to a press release from Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nThat will alleviate some of the pain the developer experienced when Hempstead left Heatherwood at the altar last December.\nThe town had rezoned 11.7 acres for multifamily housing in 2019 and its industrial development agency endorsed Heatherwood\u2019s 309-unit project in 2021.\nBut after the developer paid $27 million for the land and $3 million on soft costs, Hempstead repealed the zoning in response to fanatical NIMBYism from nearby residents. The town was left with a cavity instead of housing next to its Long Island Rail Road station in Lawrence \u2014 and\ntwo lawsuits\nfiled by Heatherwood in state court.\nThe company won its cases in state court (appeals are pending), then\nbrought a federal lawsuit\nthis fall seeking its $30 million back plus $160 million in lost profits.\nHochul has had her own problems with anti-development forces on Long Island, where officials led the \u201clocal control, not Hochul control\u201d campaign that\nstopped her Housing Compact\nin 2023. But East Farmingdale is rezoning to accommodate her project, which will include more than 100 homes affordable to households earning 80 percent of the area median income.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top home sale recorded in New York City was a condo at 67 Vestry Street for\n$15.3 million\n. The 3,000-square-foot pad has four bedrooms and three and a half baths. Corcoran\u2019s Catherine Juracich, Tom Ventura and Lesley Schulhof had the\nlisting\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was for an 88,000-square-foot industrial building at 845 East 136th Street in the Bronx for\n$21.7 million\n.\n\u2014\nMary Diduch",

        "content": "Andreina Monserratte, a self-styled real estate trainer who built a following by pitching herself as a compliance and ethics guru to brokers and agents in Miami-Dade County, allegedly stole nearly $90,000 from a home inspection company that hired her less than two years ago.\nMiami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s deputies last week arrested Monserratte, 42, on felony charges of organized fraud and grand theft tied to an alleged year-long scheme targeting her employer, Miami-based South Florida Inspectors.\nBeginning in January 2024, about a month after she was hired, Monserratte swapped out the company email on its Zelle account and substituted her own email and phone number linked to her personal and business bank accounts, according to an arrest report.\nCustomers who believed they were paying\nKendall\n-based South Florida Inspectors for services instead funneled money into Monserratte\u2019s accounts, allowing her to allegedly siphon more than $89,000 through July, investigators alleged.\nDeputies wrote in the arrest report that she \u201crefused to provide a statement.\u201d Reached by phone, Monserratte told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI am not interested in talking. Please call my attorney,\u201d then hung up without providing a name. No lawyer was listed on her court docket at the time of publication, and she has not yet entered a plea.\nGuru without a license\nMonserratte established her bonafides despite never being licensed as a broker or a sales agent, according to online state licensing records. South Florida Inspectors owner Danny Nieves and other real estate professionals who knew her and spoke to\nTRD\nwere also unaware that Monserrate had previous run-ins with the law.\n\u201cHer standing in the real estate community is impeccable as a result of her teaching people classes on MLS [\nMultiple Listing Service\n] and ethics training,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cNobody really was wise to this other side of her.\u201d\nMiami-Dade criminal court records show she was charged with petty larceny in 2003, and a year later she was charged with grand theft. Both times Monserratte completed a pre-trial intervention program, allowing her to avoid a conviction.\nIn 2006, she was arrested a third time for grand theft, receiving probation that she finished in 2011, when the court withheld adjudication \u2014 a disposition that spares defendants a formal conviction under Florida law if they successfully complete supervision. Details of Monserratte\u2019s previous arrests were not available online, as the files have been destroyed.\nStill, the earlier criminal cases did not prevent her from carving out a niche in Miami\u2019s real estate ecosystem as an informal trainer and consultant. On her professional website, Monserratte leaned heavily on themes of ethics, compliance and risk mitigation. She casts herself as a behind-the-scenes architect of some of Miami\u2019s largest brokerages.\n\u201cWe have partnered up with some of the leading industry event companies, to have you mingle with other industry professionals,\u201d Monserratte\u2019s website states. \u201cIn all aspects of life sometimes who you know will take you to the next step of where you should be.\u201d\nShe promotes intensive MLS coaching that goes beyond navigation, promising to make brokers and agents \u201cfully proficient\u201d on creating market reports, hot sheets and other data-driven practices to scale their business.\nHer website biography claims Monserratte has \u201cassisted in the recruiting, retention and training of over 500 real estate agents and brokers for some of the biggest brokerages in Miami.\u201d\nThe alleged embezzlement\nSouth Florida Inspectors owner Nieves said he first crossed paths with Monserratte soon after launching his firm in 2019, when he was struggling to gain traction and was introduced to her through a broker contact. One associate, Nieves recalled, told him that Monserratte had helped grow her brokerage from 200 to 900 agents, fueling a reputation as a \u201cvery praised\u201d and \u201cvery respected\u201d operator in the real estate industry.\nAt the time, Monserratte provided him with free advice, as well as opened doors and made introductions that \u201creally helped us take off the company,\u201d Nieves said. In 2023, after learning that Monserratte had left a full-time job as a sales manager with Broker\u2019s, a\nFort Lauderdale\n-based brokerage, he brought her on board as his company\u2019s office manager.\n\u201cI actually pursued her and offered her a job,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cSince she had helped me grow my company for free, I could only imagine how much more she could do if I hired her.\u201d\nShortly after, Nieves\u2019 father was diagnosed with stage four cancer, forcing him to step back from daily operations to shuttle him to chemotherapy and care for him.\n\u201cFor a period of almost over a year, I was taking care of my father until his suicide [earlier this year],\u201d Nieves said. \u201cSo she took advantage of it. She kind of exploited a situation when I was at my absolute low.\u201d\nHe slowly returned to the office after his father\u2019s death and realized \u201cthings just weren\u2019t adding up,\u201d Nieves said.\nHe discovered financial irregularities in his company\u2019s account in July. Internal checks revealed \u201ca very sophisticated scheme\u201d in which Monserratte allegedly \u201cwas able to manipulate and change the Zelle payments \u2026 to her personal bank account, and then embezzle money through it,\u201d he said.\nPrevious employer speaks out\nClaudia Serna\n, owner of Broker\u2019s, told\nTRD\nthat she would have warned Nieves to stay away from Monseratte, who worked for Broker\u2019s from 2021 until late 2022.\nInitially Monserratte excelled at the job, especially at agent support and recruitment, Serna said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got it going on,\u201d Serna said, describing Monserratte. \u201cShe\u2019s bilingual, responsive to agents late at night and well-liked. She\u2019s got WhatsApp and Telegram chats packed with brokers and sales associates.\u201d\nBut within months, Serna said, irregularities surfaced in a referral incentive program that used $100 Amazon gift cards emailed as thank-yous to agents who sent recruits to Broker\u2019s. Each card had a digital code that could be tracked to the Amazon account that redeemed it.\nAccording to Serna, Monserratte was copied on the gift card emails in her role overseeing recruitment. After an agent complained that a promised card showed up as already redeemed, Serna dug into her brokerage\u2019s Amazon\u2019s logs and allegedly found that \u201cmany, many of the cards were cash[ed] on on Andreina\u2019s [Amazon] account.\u201d\nWhen confronted, Serna said, Monserratte blamed her daughter.\n\u201cShe said her daughter was the one that cashed them,\u201d Serna recalled.\nBut that explanation did not add up, given the multiple email and push notifications Amazon sends when gift credits are used, Serna said.\n\u201cIf your daughter was doing this, the Amazon account is yours, you receive the notifications,\u201d Serna said. \u201cYou must have known.\u201d\nSerna said she fired Monserratte but declined to press charges.\n\u201cHer daughters were like 12 and 13 or something like that,\u201d Serna said. \u201cAnd she was a single mom. I felt sorry.\u201d\nWithin months of the Amazon incident, Serna said she saw Monserratte resurface \u2014 this time aligned with \u201cone of the big girls in the real estate industry\u201d who had launched a new brokerage.\n\u201cWhen I saw that on Instagram, I called my colleague and I told her, \u2018Listen, this happened in my office. Be careful with that girl. I really don\u2019t know what she is into, just watch out,\u2019\u201d Serna said. The colleague brushed off the warning, Serna said.\nAfter news of Monserratte\u2019s most recent arrest, Serna said her phone and industry group chats have been lighting up.\n\u201cDuring this weekend, it was being discussed like 22 times on different chats with people in the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s very well known in the real estate broker community.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A sprawling mansion in an elite Silicon Valley enclave has hit the market for the first time.\nVilla de Verano, a Lake Como-inspired estate sitting on more than 12 acres in Hillsborough was custom-built in 2013 for private equity investor Ted Kruttschnitt and his wife, Alexia, who still own the property according to public records. The only owners of Villa de Verano are asking for $88 million,\naccording to SFGATE\n. If sold at asking, the estate would set a new highwater mark for Hillsborough, where the median home sales price in November was about $3.7 million, per Redfin.\nVilla de Verano, at 3000 Ralston Avenue, in Hillsborough, is in-part the brainchild of well-known architect and interior designer duo Andrew Skurman of Skurman Architects and Suzanne Tucker of Tucker &amp; Marks Design. Jennifer Gilson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is the listing agent. When it was completed in 2013, the property received the California Landscape Contractors Association\u2019s annual Grand Sweepstakes Award for best residential estate in California, per SFGATE.\nAcross the main and guest house, the property includes six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, a 2,100-gallon saltwater aquarium, theater, a gym, and koi and reflection ponds, as well as a swimming pool, redwood grove and tennis court.\nIt\u2019s often said that confidence on the higher end of the market can affect the movement of mid and lower-tier properties as well. If Villa de Verona fetches its asking price, it would supersede the most expensive Bay Area home sale of 2025 \u2014 Woodside\u2019s Green Gables Estate, which\nwent for $85 million earlier this fall.\nHowever, the final sale was considerably under the\noriginal asking price of $135 million.\nThe previous record for Hillsborough is a home formerly owned by Elon Musk. The Tesla co-founder sold the French chateau-styled estate for $30 million in 2021. The owners then turned around and sold it the following year for $35 million,\naccording to Mansion Global.\nHillsborough made headlines earlier this year when 20th century crooner Bing Crosby\u2019s former home\ntraded hands for $25 million\n. The singer\u2019s family, which owned the 11-bedroom home for six decades, originally sought $40 million for the property.\n\u2014\nChristopher Neely\n",

        "content": "A long dormant stretch of land in Argyle is finally headed for development, as a California landowner moves forward with a $160 million mixed-use project designed to capture the rapid growth pushing north of Fort Worth.\nR.Y. Properties, led by Robert Yu, plans to develop 123 acres at the southwest corner of Robson Ranch Road and I-35 West with retail and a potential medical and wellness campus, according to an announcement from the town. The project advanced after\nArgyle\nofficials signed off on an economic development agreement following months of rezoning discussions, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nUnder the deal, R.Y. Properties will invest $25 million in site infrastructure, including roads, water, wastewater and drainage. In return, the developer will be eligible for a performance-based reimbursement of sales taxes capped at $20 million \u2014 a structure increasingly common for fast-growing North Texas suburbs eager to broaden their tax base without front-loading incentives, according to the outlet.\nThe tenant lineup is still coming together, but health care could anchor the project. Jim Wills, who manages the land for R.Y. Properties, told the outlet that there is a \u201cvery good possibility\u201d that Baylor Scott &amp; White Health will locate a campus on the site, a concept floated during earlier town meetings. Retail negotiations are also ongoing with a mix of local and national players.\nThe project won\u2019t include an\nH-E-B\n, though not for lack of trying. Wills said discussions with the grocer fell through after H-E-B opted for a site across the street in\nHillwood\u2019s\n$10 billion Landmark development, though he added that losing the grocery store opens the door to a broader range of retailers.\nTiming is key. Argyle and nearby communities are absorbing thousands of new homes, including Hillwood\u2019s 4,000-home Harvest community. Within a 10-minute drive of the site live more than 61,000 residents with an average home value north of $730,000 and a median household income above $150,000, according to a Retail Strategies report cited by the town. The site also sits near Hillwood\u2019s Alliance development, which has generated tens of thousands of jobs.\nInfrastructure has been the missing link. Wills said the land lacked access to sanitary sewer for years, a hurdle recently cleared through coordination with Texas Department of Transportation and the\nTarrant Regional Water District\n.\nWhile the full R.Y. Properties land spans about 195 acres, only 123 acres were rezoned in this phase. Town Manager Mike Sims called it a phasing issue and said additional development is likely down the road.\nArgyle estimates the project could generate roughly $127 million in sales tax revenue, supporting a broader push to rely less on property taxes \u2014 and cementing the town\u2019s bid to evolve from bedroom community to regional destination.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "I have nothing against\nJames Patchett\n. Really.\nPatchett, the Gilbane Development CEO and\nformer CEO\nof A&amp;E and the city\u2019s EDC, meant well when he\noffered housing solutions\nto Zohran Mamdani.\nBut one was off the wall:\n\u201cThe new mayor can upsize pilot programs like \u2018Unlocking Doors\u2019 to pay for those renovations in exchange for leasing the apartment to city rent voucher holders,\u201d he wrote.\nI\u2019ve had lunch with Patchett and interviewed him on stage, and\nhis wife\nused to work at\nThe Real Deal\n. But James must not be reading my column, because I explained the\nutter failure\nof Unlocking Doors on Sept. 8.\nThe headline: \u201cZero sum game: City program has awarded landlords no grants.\u201d\nThe subhead: \u201cIn 20 months, \u2018Unlocking Doors\u2019 has yet to open any.\u201d\nWhy on earth would Mamdani upsize a program that is clearly not working?\nUnlocking Doors is a classic example of government ostensibly trying to solve one problem, then designing a program that tries to solve others and ends up solving none.\nThe objective was to provide rent-stabilized landlords money to renovate vacant units that were rendered unfixable in 2019 by the state\u2019s Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act.\nBut the Adams administration added another goal: helping voucher holders. Making Unlocking Doors exclusive to them scared away countless owners.\n\u201cSection 8 = tenants for life and we\u2019re not talking the cream of the crop,\u201d one reader\ncommented\non a Gothamist story.\nThe city also limited the program to low-rent units (no more than $1,200 for a one-bedroom or $1,400 for a three-bedroom) that had been vacant for two years.\nIt required landlords to first pay for the renovation, which many lack the funds to do, then pray to be reimbursed. That scared away more of them.\nIf any were still interested, they gave up after seeing that the city would pay no more than $25,000, which is about enough to pull building permits, or maybe to update one bathroom.\nThe city later upped the amount to $50,000 \u2014 still not enough for many apartments \u2014 and didn\u2019t alter the other terms that made Unlocking Doors so unloved.\nBy \u201cupsize,\u201d I assume Patchett meant Mamdani should increase the program\u2019s funding and maximum number of units (initially $10 million for 400 apartments). But what the program really needs are fundamental changes.\nMy suggestions:\nOffer the money upfront, rather than as reimbursement. Landlords and their contractors don\u2019t trust the city to pay them back in a timely manner, if at all.\nGet rid of the $50,000 limit. Instead, approve applications based on merit. An $80,000 rehab of a deteriorated two-bedroom may be perfectly justified.\nAllow non-voucher holders to rent the units. Voucher holders would still get some of them, and those who don\u2019t would still be helped as the new supply absorbed other apartment seekers.\nOne pitfall of the two-year vacancy requirement is that owners might warehouse units until they qualify for the program. But if the program were attractive enough, its funding would be used up before anyone unnecessarily holding units empty could apply.\nMamdani will likely try to create viable programs to get vacant, rent-stabilized units back on the market because he opposes rent increases, which are the only other way to pay for renovations.\nBut scaling up a program that has zero participants would serve no purpose. Unlocking Doors needs an overhaul.\nMaybe Patchett meant beef up, not scale up. Maybe an editor changed his copy. Whatever the case, James, thanks for the column idea. Next lunch is on me.\n",

        "content": "This list of top 10 office sales in Los Angeles County is based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of data via Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Colliers through late-September, along with consideration of prior reporting. It includes six trades that came outside the reach of Measure ULA, the property transfer tax that applies only within the City of Los Angeles\u2013though that probably had less to do with the tax, and more about pricing and location.\nThis list covers the top 10 office trades by total price, but ranks them by price per square foot. There were other, pricier deals on a square footage basis over the same period, but they are not included because their total prices didn\u2019t meet the mark.\nWhile there is still time for potential record-breakers, these are the deals that make the top 10 for 2025 to this point:\n1601 Vine Street\nKingsbarn Realty Capital\npurchased\nan eight-story building located in Hollywood and occupied by Kim Kardashian\u2019s Skims for $105 million. It came after a lawsuit against the lender that derailed an earlier deal. JH Snyder was the seller of the property at 1601 Vine Street, along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The deal worked out to $908 per square foot, the priciest on a square foot basis on the ranking.\nMaple Plaza\nPublicly traded real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\npurchased\nthe office campus in Beverly Hills from Tishman Speyer for $205.3 million, or $701 per square foot.\nTRD\nfirst reported Tishman was selling, but the buyer was a\nmystery\n.\nOnce the buyer was revealed, we learned it was a competitive process, and more information on Maple Plaza came during an Kilroy\nearnings call\n, where Chief Executive Angela Aman said\u00a0 the property had \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio.\u201d\nMurdock Plaza\nReal estate investment trust Douglas Emmett\npurchased\nMurdock Plaza at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The 17-story office tower at the corner of Westwood and Wilshire boulevards traded hands for $131.1 million, or $539 per square foot. The company later\nannounced\nplans to turn the office tower into apartments.\nIlo at Playa Vista\nSilicon Beach may not be what it used to be, but trades there are still pricier than downtown. Clarion Partners\nsold\na creative office campus at 12130 to 12180 Millenium Drive to institutional investor Barings for $150.7 million, or $512 per square foot. The Playa Vista mixed-use complex was 90 percent occupied but faced near-term lease expirations. Clarion purchased the property more than a decade earlier for $133 million.\nEntrada\nFenway Capital Advisors\npurchased\nan 11-story office building in Culver City for $130 million. The seller was Lincoln Property Company and Goldman Sachs affiliate Broad Street Principal Investments, and the deal came out to $413 per square foot. But the $130 million doesn\u2019t cover the $142.5 million debt the sellers took on to develop the property at 6181 Centinela Avenue that was 75 percent occupied. It is more than the $33 million the joint venture partners paid for the real estate back in 2018 when it was a stalled development site.\nThe Park Calabasas\nCross Ocean Partners and Palisade Group purchased a three-story office building in Calabasas, an affluent area, where San Fernando Valley meets the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains, for $69.4 million, or $312 per square foot, from the U.S. arm of China-based investment company Gemdale. It sold for less than its prior $79 million purchase price four years ago but was completely leased.\nPasadena Towers\nPasadena has seen its fair share of office distress, and the sale of Pasadena Towers, not to be confused with the Pasadena Office Tower, was no different. The two-building complex\ntraded\nfor $125 million, or $262 per square foot. The two properties, at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard, connected by a courtyard, had a prior price of $256 million. Harbor Associates and Roxborough Group were the buyers, the seller was CBRE Investment Management. It was the largest ever investment by Harbor Associates.\nFigueroa at Wilshire\nBrookfield is synonymous with downtown Los Angeles office distress. The giant\ndumped\na 52-story tower at 601 South Figueroa Street, and it happened to be the priciest trade all year but was still less than the debt connected to the property. Uncommon Developers purchased the skyscraper for $210 million in an off-market trade that amounted to $201 a square foot. The debt balance was $250 million, though we learned there was no impairment on it. The pricing was distressed, but an office trade above $150 per square foot is still something nowadays.\nColliers\u2019 Mark Schuessler represented Uncommon Developers; Newmark\u2019s Kevin Shannon represented Brookfield, which may not have another trade on our ranking but does have\ndistressed offerings\nconnected to properties it either owns or lost control to receivers. In September, there was a conference at Uncommon Developers\u2019 601 South Figueroa Street, on the twenty-third floor overlooking the rest of the financial district \u2014 it was gutted then.\n400 to 600 Corporate Pointe\nNew York Life Insurance\nsold\na Culver City office campus for $72.5 million. Sunny Hills Capital Management Company purchased the buildings at 400 and 600 Corporate Pointe in a deal that came out to $159 per square foot. The property recently underwent a renovation to the tune of $18.7 million.\n101 North Brand Boulevard\nIzek Shomof\npurchased\na 19-story office building in Glendale for $58.8 million from Beacon Capital Partners, around half the $128.5 million the seller paid in 2016. The latest deal comes out to $143 per square foot. Shomof recently made another\ndiscounted buy\n, a Long Beach office tower for $50 million, or around $100 per square foot, that didn\u2019t make the cut.\n",

The partnership paid $16.5 million for the 0.8-acre assemblage, which is home to six-unit and 12-unit apartment buildings. They are just outside of Morningside\u2019s gates.\nBrennan moved to Miami from San Diego during the pandemic, and he ended up building a waterfront estate in\nMorningside\nwhere he lives with his family. The Miami neighborhood is northeast of the Miami Design District, and just north of Bay Point.\n\u201cI fell in absolute love with Morningside as a neighbor,\u201d he said.\nThis project will \u201cbasically double\u201d the number of homes that are waterfront in the neighborhood. The building will also be within walking distance of the Cushman School and Morningside Park.\nBrennan said the project will cost about $150 million to develop. He and Jacobsen have both developed residential properties in the past. They tapped Brandon Haw Architecture to design the project, with interiors by Thomas Schoos\u2019 design firm.\nIn addition to the 17 units, the building will also have four 500-square-foot nanny or grandmother flats that buyers can purchase. The units will ask an average of $2,500 per square foot. He expects to launch sales next year, by the summer.\nThe units will range from about 4,200 square feet to 7,700 square feet. All buyers will be interviewed by Brennan, he said.\nThe two properties that make up the site previously sold for $2.7 million in 2012, records show. The seller is Miami-based UES Partners, led by Robert Vecsler. Vecsler is CEO of New York-based\nHyperion\nDevelopment Group.\nBrennan is a co-founder of Suja Juice, which is sold at Whole Foods, and Kopari Beauty. He\u2019s also a senior adviser to Paine Schwartz Partners, which describes itself as a private equity firm that invests in the sustainable food chain.\nJacobson, who co-developed the Six Senses resort in Ibiza with architect and developer Jonathan Leitersdorf, is\nalso working with\nProsper Group on projects in Brickell and North Bay Village.\n",

        "content": "As companies shift focus to office space in the Dallas suburbs, so do investors. The region\u2019s largest office trade of the year (by more than 100,000 square feet) was in the north Dallas city of Plano.\nBut this year\u2019s list of biggest sales also reflects the supremacy of Uptown, which has cemented its status as the most coveted office submarket with the rise of \u201cY\u2019all Street.\u201d Uptown is becoming the headquarters of Dallas\u2019 answer to Wall Street, with financial companies ranking the walkable district first on their office wishlists.\nHere\u2019s the list of Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s largest office sales of the year, with data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Avison Young, Colliers, CBRE and Newmark.\nLegacy West | 5905 Legacy Drive | 575,033 square feet\nIndianapolis-based real estate investment trust Kite Realty teamed up with global investor GIC to plant a flag in Plano. The pair snagged Plano\u2019s crown jewel,\nLegacy West\n, for a whopping $785 million in April. The property, at 5908 Headquarters Drive, is billed as a high-end retail center, but it\u2019s also got 575,000 square feet of\nprime suburban Dallas office space\n\u2014 which has been the saving grace of the sluggish Dallas office market in 2025. The seller was a joint venture of The Karahan Companies and Invesco.\nTexas Capital Center | 2000 McKinney Street | 456,000 square feet\nAn Uptown trade ranked second. Crescent Real Estate picked up the\n21-story Texas Capital Center\n, at 2000 McKinney Avenue, in what was the city\u2019s largest office deal in years. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price in September, but\u00a0 \u201ca significant value increase,\u201d it said in a release. The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016. It is anchored by Texas Capital Bank, which occupies 44 percent of the property. The bank has 15 more years on its lease. CoStar reported the building was 82.7 percent occupied in May. The property is adjacent to Klyde Warren Park.\nGalleria North Tower | 13737 Noel Road | 379,518 square feet\nBack to the \u2018burbs: Boston-based WS Development\nnabbed Galleria North Tower\n, a 380,000-square-foot office tower in the Dallas North Tollway corridor for an undisclosed price in April. The seller was a fund owned by the Iowa Public Employees Retirement System. The property last changed hands in 2014 for $86 million, according to an SEC filing. The 16-story building, at 13737 Noel Road, was built in 1998 and is about 65 percent occupied\nSterling Plaza | 5949 Sherry Lane | 320,000 square feet\nCalifornians aren\u2019t just buying up homes in Texas. San Francisco\u2013based Shorenstein Investment Advisers\nacquired Sterling Plaza\n, a 19-story, 313,600-square-foot office building in Dallas\u2019 Preston Center submarket. The building at 5949 Sherry Lane is 87 percent leased and underwent renovations in 2023. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the July acquisition marks Shorenstein\u2019s second major Dallas office investment in under a year, following its 2024 purchase of International Plaza II.\nThe Link | 2601 Olive Street | 292,000 square feet\nAtlanta-based Cousins Properties wrapped up the Texas summer with a bang. The REIT\nbought The Link at Uptown\nin Dallas in July for $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot, as part of a $1 billion buying spree. The seller was Dallas-based Kaizen Development Partners, which completed the 25-story tower, at 2601 Olive Street, in 2021. It\u2019s about 94 percent leased.\nThe Crossings | 5429 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway | 233,000 square feet\nSkywalker Property Partners has\nre-entered the office market\nwith its first acquisition in seven years. The Dallas-based firm bought The Crossings, a 233,000-square-foot office building at 5429 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway for an undisclosed price. The 10-story building near Galleria Dallas was 94 percent leased at the time of sale in May. The seller was Goddard Investment Group. The asset will be folded into Skywalker\u2019s recently launched investment fund, the Leverage Strikes Back LLC.\n4331 Communications Drive | 206,040 square feet\nDallas-based Forefront Commercial Real Estate snapped up 4331 at Pinnacle Park, an Oak Cliff office at 4331 Communications Drive in January. The property\nended up in foreclosure\nafter Mexico City-based private equity fund the Aztec Fund appeared to default on a $65 million loan from Bank of American tied to 4331 at Pinnacle Park and five other North Texas assets.\nCommerce Plaza Hillcrest | 12800\u201312890 Hillcrest Road | 204,650 square feet\nOne of the biggest office deals of the year has nothing to do with the office space. In the first quarter, Texas grocery giant H-E-B picked up Commerce Plaza Hillcrest for the land. The 204,650-square-foot office campus, at 2800\u201312890 Hillcrest Road sits on nearly 10 acres. H-E-B is gearing up to build its first Dallas store on the property after winning a contentious zoning fight against residents who said the store would be \u201cout of character\u201d with the neighborhood. Plus, H-E-B did the seller a solid by taking the property off its hands: Silver Star Properties is three years into a sell-off of its commercial holdings as it tries to execute a pivot to self-storage. The purchase price was not disclosed.\nIntellicenter | 3701 Regent Boulevard | 200,079 square feet\nDoug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial Investments bought Intellicenter in February for an undisclosed price, and plans to give it a new life. The 200,000-square-foot Irving office property at 3701 Regent Boulevard was also part of the Aztec Fund-owned portfolio that\nlanded in foreclosure\nin 2024. Intellicenter was built in 2007.\nPreston Sherry Plaza | 8201 Preston Road | 165,000 square feet\nAustin-based Endeavor\nplanted a flag in Dallas\nwith its purchase of Preston Sherry Plaza in July. The 165,000-square-foot mixed-use development features two floors of retail and five floors of offices. It was built in 1986 and was 93 percent leased at the time of the trade. Endeavor\u2019s ownership is clearly shaking things up, as Sevy\u2019s Grill, a longtime Preston Hollow power lunch haunt anchoring the ground floor, announced plans to close in the summer of 2026.\n",

        "content": "David Schwartz\u2019s Slate Property Group closed on its acquisition of the Stewart Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, readying a massive hotel-to-residential conversion.\nSlate and its nonprofit partner Breaking Ground acquired the property at 371 Seventh Avenue for $255 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Over the summer,\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nthat the partners were nearing a deal to grab the property from Jack Yadidi\u2019s Sioni Group and Isaac Chetrit\u2019s Patriarch Equities for around $275 million.\nYadidi and Chetrit had envisioned a conversion of the property. Yadidi filed\nplans\nwith the city last year to convert the property into a 625-unit residential project. It was a 618-key hotel, but it closed in 2022 and was temporarily used as a migrant shelter.\nSlate and Breaking Ground are pursuing a similar project, though with a slightly lower unit count.\nThe incoming ownership group will convert the property into 579 affordable housing units, including apartments for formerly homeless individuals. Monthly rents are expected to start between $1,385 to $1,731.\nThe redevelopment will also include office space for social services overseen by Breaking Ground. The conversion is expected to take two years, a shorter timeline than comparable projects due to the property\u2019s existing residential-favorable layout.\nThe all-in cost of the redevelopment, including the building acquisition, will reach roughly $500 million. The state\u2019s Hotel and Commercial Conversions Program is providing $87 million in financing.\n\u201cThis project combines extraordinary scale, rapid construction and long-term stewardship by a respected non-profit,\u201d Schwartz said.\nPatriarch, Sioni and Highgate acquired the then-four-star hotel across from Madison Square Garden in 2016 for\n$217.5 million\n, securing a $158.8 million loan from Blackstone. Early last year, Chetrit acquired Highgate\u2019s stake in the hotel, clearing the way for the conversion.\nSlate is one of the city\u2019s most prolific affordable housing developers. A few months ago, the city\npicked\nSlate, Xenolith Partners and nonprofit Comunilife to build more than 600 affordable housing units in northern Manhattan. The team will develop 4095 Ninth Avenue, a long-vacant, city-owned site along the Harlem River in Inwood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The site at 245 Duffield Street is home to a vacant two-story building, formerly a Planet Fitness gym.\nThe permits submitted to the Department of Buildings call for a 100,000-square-foot project with 4,600 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Residential amenities will include a golf simulator, swimming pool, sauna and fitness center.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the units will be rentals or condos, though previously filed paperwork hints at the latter.

The seller was Morris Associates XI, a subsidiary of local developer Jeffrey A. Morris Group.\nIn 2023, Jeffrey A. Morris Group started the process of revamping the office to create a bigger corporate complex, which included upping the Shoreline Boulevard building\u2019s size from one story to six, adding more than 80,000 square feet of offices to the property. The city of Mountain View approved Jeffrey A. Morris Group\u2019s plan, though the firm never followed through with redeveloping the building.\nThe purchase comes the same week the tech giant offloaded another property in Sunnyvale. Planetary Ventures, a joint venture between Google and the California Air National Guard sold the building at 494 South Bernardo Avenue to 494 Bernardo LP, a subsidiary of Palo Alto-based The Mozart Development Company.\nThe building is located in a neighborhood where Google once committed to building 7,000 residential units and 360 commercial-use condominiums as part of its\nNorth Bayshore development plan\n; it was approved for those plans in 2023, but backed away from them as part of its wider retreat from real estate development. In May, Google sought to sell 40 acres in Mountain View where it previously planned to build 1,900 homes, 380 affordable housing units, 50,000 square feet of retail space and 1.3 million square feet of offices in a mixed-use development known as\nMiddlefield Park\n.\nGoogle\u2019s building purchase follows similar moves by Nvidia and Apple this year to buy buildings they lease for offices.\nIn September, Nvidia added to its office holdings with the\npurchase of 2701 San Tomas Expressway\nin Santa Clara from Sobrato for $83.2 million, part of a four-building complex. In May, Nvidia purchased three other buildings in the Santa Clara office complex from Sobrato in May for $254 million.\nOver the summer, Apple bought a three-building, 220,700-square-foot property at 10200 North Tantau Avenue in Cupertino, for\nmore than $166.9 million\nin an all-cash deal from PGIM, followed by the acquisition of Kilroy Realty\u2019s four-building\nMathilda Campus\nin Sunnyvale for $365 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s chain store count keeps sliding, even as storefront vacancies remain tight and food brands keep expanding.\nThe number of national retailers across the five boroughs fell 1.3 percent over the past year, a net loss of 112 locations, marking the sixth decline in eight years, according to the Center for an Urban Future\u2019s 2025 \u201cState of the Chains\u201d\nreport\n.\nThe pullback was driven by the city\u2019s biggest and most entrenched players. Seven of the 10 largest chains shrank their footprints, losing a combined 92 stores. Starbucks led the retreat, closing 42 locations since late last year, while longtime fixtures like Old Navy, Staples, Banana Republic, Duane Reade and GNC also posted notable declines, CUF found.\nEighteen retailers shut down all of their New York City locations this year, the highest total outside of the pandemic-era wave of closures in 2020, including Rite Aid, Party City, Rent-A-Center and Forever 21.\nThe contraction continues a longer reset. Nearly one in five chains tracked in CUF\u2019s 2019 report have since exited the city entirely. Of the 17 largest retailers operating six years ago, all but two have fewer stores today, a combined loss of more than 1,000 locations.\nCell phone stores, pharmacies and apparel chains have been hit hardest, reflecting the sustained drag of e-commerce and shifting consumer habits on traditional retail categories.\nStill, the data shows plenty of churn rather than a broad collapse: while 133 chains reduced their footprint over the past year, 114 added locations and 258 held steady. Dunkin\u2019 once again ranked as the city\u2019s largest chain and overtook Starbucks as Manhattan\u2019s top retailer, cementing its dominance across all five boroughs; Starbucks came in second, while Metro by T-Mobile ranked third.\nGrowth came overwhelmingly from food and beverage operators, which now account for a record 55.8 percent of all chain locations citywide. Fast-casual restaurants, bakeries, pizza chains and ice cream shops all posted gains, led by brands like Naya, Van Leeuwen, Maman, Wonder and 7th Street Burger expanding aggressively.\nFitness concepts also grew, led by Club Pilates, SLT and StretchLab.\nGeographically, every borough saw a net decline, but Queens stood out for resilience, losing only two stores and hosting six of the seven ZIP codes with the biggest gains.\nFor landlords and brokers, the takeaway is familiar: legacy chains are still retrenching, but demand hasn\u2019t disappeared; it\u2019s being reshuffled toward food and fitness\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group teamed up to pay a record $520 million for Aimco\u2019s waterfront Brickell assemblage, with plans for a luxury hotel and residential project,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nOak Row, led by Erik Rutter and David Weitz, and OKO bought the 4.24-acre property consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Mariposa Real Estate partnered on the purchase.\nThe deal, which closed Tuesday, breaks down to $122.4 million per acre. It is the most expensive sale of a development site in South Florida.\nOak Row put the property\nunder contract\nfor $520 million a year ago, at the time announcing only Mariposa as its co-buyer. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later. Throughout this year, Oak Row made the required periodic deposits, Aimco\u2019s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.\nTyko Capital, a joint venture between debt broker Adi Chugh and billionaire hedge funder Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management, provided $464.5 million senior loan for the purchase and predevelopment.\nThe developers plan to build a hotel and branded condos in the project\u2019s first phase, according to the release. It will join a crowded pipeline of branded residences in South Florida.\nThe tri-county region is the\nepicenter\nfor branded residential projects in North America, according to Knight Frank. As of last month, Miami had\n48 completed\nand 55 planned branded projects, second only to Dubai, according to Savills.\nBranded\nSouth Florida projects on tap include Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Karmely\u2019s KAR Properties\nFaena Residences\non the Miami River, in partnership with Alan Faena; and Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group\nHQ Residences Miami\nin Edgewater, in partnership with Sam Nazarian\u2019s HQ Hotels &amp; Residences by sbe. Marc Anthony is one of Nazarian\u2019s partners.\nOther projects are the\nRitz-Carlton\nin North Bay Village, a\nWaldorf Astoria\nunder construction in downtown Miami and a\nNobu\nin Brickell.\nThe Brickell property, which has 485 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage, can be developed by right with multiple supertalls totalling over 3 million square feet across property types. The tallest height allowed in Miami is 1,049 feet due to Federal Aviation Administration rules.\nDenver-based Aimco, which last month announced a\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slower multifamily market, first listed the sites last year, with an asking price of about\n$650 million\n. The announcement of its dissolution came as Aimco, led by Wes Powell, was selling off properties nationwide.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard led the CBRE team that marketed the Brickell sites.\nOak Row, which has offices in Miami and New York, is on a Miami development spree focused on luxury rentals. Its two Edgewater towers are the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne with 187,000 square feet of commercial space, financed with a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan secured in March; and the 38-story, 324-unit 2900 Terrace tower, financed with a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan secured in June.\nOak Row and its partners this year completed the\nWynwood Plaza\nmixed-use project with a 509-unit apartment building and a 266,000-square-foot office building in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Across from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami, the firm also plans the First &amp; Fifth apartment tower, approved for\n526 units\n.\nOKO and London-based Cain International completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami last year, scoring a pre-leasing bonanza during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. Elsewhere, their projects include the 135-unit Una Residences condo tower in Brickell, and the 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater. Doronin and Len Blavatnik started construction in August of\nAman Miami Beach\nwith hotel rooms and condos.\nLittle has been revealed in marketing materials about Mariposa. It appears tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, who founded firms in the frozen food, chemicals and consumer goods industries. In 2022, Franklin bought a\nbig minority stake\nin the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThe Brickell site sale surpassed the biggest development site deal in South Florida to date. In 2022, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin paid\n$363 million\nfor a 2.5-acre bayfront Brickell lot where he plans a Citadel and Citadel Securities headquarters office tower and other uses. That deal equated to $145.2 million per acre, more than what Oak Row and OKO paid on a per acre basis.\nOak Row and OKO\u2019s total purchase price likely was more than what Griffin had paid because the Aimco assemblage includes income-producing office and apartment buildings.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s biggest hotel trades of 2025 were led by three nine-figure deals for waterfront and resort properties, as investors bet on continued strength in luxury leisure and Miami\u2019s urban hospitality market despite rising financing costs. The 10 largest sales totaled more than $960 million, with buyers ranging from institutional firms, global hotel investors, local developers and mission-driven nonprofits.\u200b The combined sales volume dipped significantly compared to last year when the\ntop 10 hotel deals of 2024\ncombined for $1.5 billion.\n1. $205M | Silver Sands Beach Resort | Key Biscayne\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Miami-based Fortune International Group splashed into Key Biscayne with the most expensive hotel purchase this year.\u00a0 The joint venture paid $205 million for the oceanfront Silver Sands Beach Resort at 301 Ocean Drive. The deal, which closed in April, also set a record price for a Key Biscayne development site sale. The developers plan on redeveloping the 50-room hotel into a 14-story boutique condominium with 56 units. An affiliate of Coral Gables-based Axis Development Corporation sold the 3.9-acre property. The price amounted to $52.6 million per acre.\n2. $204M | The Raleigh | Miami Beach\nThis year\u2019s second-biggest hotel sale was a major blow to developer Michael Shvo. In October, he was forced to sell the historic Art Deco hotel, on 3 acres at 1775 Collins Avenue, after he was unable to match a winning $204.1 million bid by private equity firm Nahla Capital, led by Genghis Hadi. Shvo had gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower alongside the hotel on the beachfront site. But the project languished. The price amounted to $68 million per acre.\n3. $171M | PGA National Resort | Palm Beach Gardens\nThis transaction was part of a larger $400 million-plus deal in January involving an 807-acre property in Palm Beach Gardens. Henderson Park, Salamander Collection and South Street Partners paid $171.4 million for PGA National Resort at 400 Avenue of the Champions. Toronto-based Brookfield sold the 360-key resort and its golf and spa facilities. The courses were designed by golfing legends Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Fazio, Andy Staples and Karl Litten. The price amounted to $475,000 per key.\n4. $148M | East Miami | Brickell\nBlackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, bought the EAST Miami hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza for $147.8 million in September. Trinity Investments and Certares sold the 40-story building for $26 million below the previous sale price in 2021. The 352-key hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza anchors the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex originally developed by Swire. The price amounted to $420,000 per key.\n5. $99M | Moxy Miami | Wynwood\nIstanbul-based S\u00fczer Group, led by Sami \u00c7ak\u0131r and Vice Chairman Baran S\u00fczer, dropped $99 million for a majority stake in the MOXY Miami Wynwood in January. Seller DolphinBay Hospitality, a joint venture between Dolphin Capital Partners and Baywood Hotels, kept a 48 stake in the eight-story, 120-key building at 255 Northwest 25th Street. DolphinBay completed the Kobi Karp-designed hotel in 2024, five years after acquiring the 0.4-acre development site for $11 million.\n6. $44M | KImpton Angler\u2019s | Miami Beach\nFrench hotelier Philippe Le Guennec returned to Miami Beach with a big transaction this year. An entity managed by Le Guennec bought\u00a0 Kimpton Angler\u2019s Hotel in Miami Beach for $43.5 million this month. San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners sold the 132-key building on a 1-acre site at 600 Washington Avenue. The trade breaks down to about $330,000 per room. Le Guennec, who owns 10 hotels in Paris, sold a 24-key Art Deco hotel in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood for $9 million in 2017.\n7. $37M | Plunge Beach Resort | Lauderdale-by-the-Sea\nIn July, T2 Hospitality, led by Mike Patel, acquired Plunge Beach Resort for $36.6 million. An entity managed by Oleksandr Naumyk and Liubov Tereshko sold the 163-room beachfront property consisting of a pair of two-story buildings and a five-story low-rise at 4660 North Ocean Drive. Newport Beach, California-based T2 Hospitality paid roughly $224,500 per key.\n8. $31M | Fairwind Hotel Miami | Miami Beach\nAn Art Deco property in South Beach sold at a discount in November. A joint venture between Tony Di Piazza and Private Exchange Group bought the Fairwind Hotel Miami at 1000 Collins Avenue for $31 million, $298,000 per key and 26 percent below the sale price four years ago. In 2021, seller Israel Katz paid $42 million for the 104-room low-rise building completed in 1936.\n9. $24M | Stadium Hotel | Miami Gardens\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit led by Michael Weinstein, purchased Stadium Hotel in Miami Gardens for $24 million in August. The foundation paid all cash for the 217-room building at 21485 Northwest 27th Avenue in a deal that breaks down to $211,000 per key. An entity managed by David and William Ross sold the 3.9-acre site after months of marketing to hospitality, multifamily, assisted living and alternative-use investors. The buyer likely plans to convert the seven-story building into affordable housing for low-income residents living with HIV.\n10. $23M | Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West | Doral\nRatia Real Estate Development bought the Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West at 1212 Northwest 82nd Avenue in Doral for $23 million in October. An affiliate of Miami-based Qua Integral Services Real Estate sold the 112-key condo-hotel for roughly $205,000 per unit.",

        "content": "Chicago Public Schools blinked on a small but symbolically charged property tax increase, as the city\u2019s broader budget fight reached a boiling point.\nChicago Board of Education President Sean Harden quietly pulled a resolution last week that would have allowed CPS to squeeze an additional $25 million from property owners this year, backing away from a move the district has made annually for more than a decade, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The measure was set for a vote at last week\u2019s board meeting and would have pushed the district\u2019s levy to the maximum allowed under state law.\nHarden, a mayoral appointee tapped last year by Brandon Johnson to lead the hybrid, partially elected school board, said Monday the decision had nothing to do with\nCity Hall\npolitics. Instead, he told the outlet that the pullback stemmed from \u201coutstanding questions\u201d among board members about the levy itself.\nStill, the timing was hard to miss. The maneuver landed squarely in the middle of Johnson\u2019s high-stakes\nbudget showdown\nwith the\nCity Council\n, where the mayor has cast himself as a bulwark against rising taxes \u2014 particularly on working-class homeowners.\nWhile $25 million is a rounding error in\nCPS\u2019 budget\n, the stakes stretch beyond this year. Property tax hikes are cumulative, meaning skipping the increase permanently lowers the district\u2019s baseline. If CPS ultimately passes on the extra levy authority, it would mark the first time since 2009 that the district failed to raise taxes to the legal limit, according to the Tribune.\nThe district isn\u2019t exactly flush. CPS closed a $729 million budget gap this summer through layoffs and service cuts and still carries billions in long-term debt. Its financial plan leans heavily on $522 million in tax increment financing revenue, boosted by Johnson\u2019s push to declare a record $1 billion TIF surplus.\nProperty taxes remain CPS\u2019 largest and most reliable revenue source. The August budget already baked in a 2.9 percent levy increase, or $232.5 million, from last year. Any further bump would have landed on homeowners already reeling from a 16.7 percent jump in median property tax bills across Chicago, according to the publication.\nThe board could still revive the proposal at a special meeting before the Dec. 29 deadline to finalize the levy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s once crowded construction skyline is getting another subtraction.\nNorthland Living put a planned 35-story condo tower near the Texas Capitol on ice, the latest sign that the city\u2019s development boom is losing steam as supply piles up and buyers hesitate. Northland delayed the groundbreaking and sales launch for\nLuminary\n, a roughly 400-foot-tall residential tower planned for the northwest corner of West 14th and Guadalupe streets,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal. The project had been targeting a late 2025 start, but will now wait out what the developer called unstable market conditions.\nNorthland Living President and COO Tony Kaleel said in an emailed statement to the outlet that a sales launch and groundbreaking were paused in order to wait for \u201cmore stable market conditions.\u201d\nThe pause comes as Austin\u2019s condo market tilts sharply in\nbuyers\u2019 favor\n. Local brokerage Team Price Real Estate reported that metro area condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units in December, more than double the supply from three years earlier. At the same time, prices have slid. The median\ncondo sale price\nfell to $337,500 in November, down from a peak of about $470,000 in April 2022.\nLuminary isn\u2019t alone. Across Austin,\nmultifamily towers\n, office projects and mixed-use developments have been delayed, resized or rethought, amid elevated vacancies, higher construction costs and lingering questions about long-term space demand from tech and other white-collar employers. Slower\nin-migration\nhas only added to the pressure, according to the publication.\nNorthland Living first unveiled plans for Luminary in January 2024, pitching a 354,616-square-foot tower designed by Page Southerland Page. A year later, the developer refined the concept to roughly 280 condos, ranging from 600 square feet to 2,700 square feet, along with ground-floor retail and a single level of office space. Prices were expected to start around $499,000 and climb above $3 million, with about half of the units priced below $1 million. Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales.\nThe site, which measures less than an acre, is currently occupied by two low-rise buildings, one housing the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which is slated to relocate into the new tower\u2019s office space when \u2014 or if \u2014 the project moves forward. Northland has secured a site development permit that runs through July 2028, giving it a long runway to restart construction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A failed luxury home deal on Wisconsin\u2019s Geneva Lake spilled into court, with the seller of a storied estate accusing a deep-pocketed Chicago buyer of tying up the property and blowing a $15 million hole in its value.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation sued financier and former pharmaceutical executive Jack McGinley, alleging that his $37.5 million offer to buy Aloha Lodge in Lake Geneva was binding, and that his eventual walkaway cost the estate crucial market momentum. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in Lake County, Wisconsin, claims breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing and seeks unspecified damages, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nAloha Lodge\n, a roughly 20,000-square-foot mansion on the south shore of Lake Geneva, which sits on 12 acres at 768 South Lake Shore Drive, ultimately sold in August 2024 for $21.9 million \u2014 far below both its original\n$35 million\nasking price and McGinley\u2019s offer. The foundation contends that McGinley\u2019s conduct forced that outcome. LSV Asset Management\u2019s James Owens was the buyer.\nAccording to the complaint, McGinley and his wife, Julie, executed a written offer in May 2023 to buy the estate for $37.5 million, which the foundation accepted the next day. Afterward, the suit alleges, McGinley sought information about other showings and competing bids and asked the seller to delay updating the multiple listing service to reflect an accepted offer. The foundation says the maneuver stalled activity and chilled interest in the property.\nComplicating matters, McGinley suffered a pulmonary embolism during the attorney review period, requiring emergency hospitalization. The foundation claims it was advised such a medical event could justify terminating a contract, but alleges McGinley instead used the moment to seek revised terms \u2014 including a delayed closing, a new health-related walkaway provision and a due diligence clause tied to renovation plans. No earnest money was ever delivered, the suit alleges, and McGinley ultimately abandoned the deal.\nMcGinley\u2019s attorney, John Ruskusky, flatly disputes that any binding contract existed. In a statement to the Tribune, Ruskusky said the offer was subject to attorney review, that McGinley requested reasonable changes the seller failed to address, and that the proposal became null and void by its own terms. He also cited McGinley\u2019s medical emergency as a factor in his decision not to proceed.\nAloha Lodge has deep\nChicago ties\n. The Southern colonial-style mansion was built in about 1900 for Tracy Drake, co-founder of the Drake and Blackstone hotels. Harold B. Smith, a longtime Illinois Tool Works executive, bought the property in 1998 and undertook a major renovation before his death in 2022. His foundation, formed in 2018, inherited the estate and listed it in 2023.\nThe lawsuit also points to a parallel deal gone sideways. About the same time as the Lake Geneva negotiations, McGinley had a contract to buy another foundation-owned estate in Palm Beach for $38 million, a deal he also exited. That property later sold for $29.3 million.\nThe foundation said accepting a lower price for Aloha Lodge directly harmed the nonprofit organizations it supports, including the Newberry Library and\nRush University System\nfor Health. Ruskusky rejected claims that McGinley has a pattern of breaching contracts, calling him a \u201chighly reputable\u201d buyer with a long track record of successful deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation long vowed to buy or build\naffordable housing\nand hold onto the properties in perpetuity \u2014 a commitment it is now poised to break.\nThe nonprofit landlord plans to put four\nTenderloin\n-area buildings on the market, which would mark the first asset sales in its history as the organization works to stabilize its balance sheet, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The\nnonprofit\nhas not disclosed expected asking prices and is soliciting broker proposals to market the assets either individually or as a package, with listings expected in January.\nThe soon-to-be-for-sale properties include the Dalt Hotel at 34 Turk Street, the West Hotel at 141 Eddy Street, Civic Center Residences at 44 McAllister Street and 270 Turk Street, which the nonprofit acquired in 2019 specifically to preserve long-term affordability. Together, the properties contain 581 units serving formerly homeless residents, seniors and tenants with health or substance abuse issues.\nJennifer Dolin, CEO of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, framed the decision as a necessary \u201cpivot\u201d to preserve the rest of the organization\u2019s more than 50-building portfolio.\n\u201cLike any real estate holding company, there are risks\u2026 and unfortunately, the headwinds and what\u2019s happened to us as a society has just made it impossible for us to keep pace,\u201d Dolin said. \u201cWe find ourselves in this really unfortunate and difficult position where we have to explore all possibilities.\u201d\nThe buildings are contending with vacancy rates between 12 and 22 percent, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation said. About 175 permanent\nsupportive housing\ntenants live in 183 units and receive rent subsidies and access to on-site services, while other apartments are capped for households earning up to 50 percent of area median income. City tenant protections generally prevent resident displacement during a sale. It remains unclear whether all affordability restrictions would remain intact over the long term as units turn over.\nThe strain on the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation\u2019s portfolio is affecting its development work as well. The organization is pausing two of its major construction efforts: a 199-unit senior housing project at 1234 Great Highway and a 120-unit affordable housing project at 149 Pennsylvania Street, Katie Lamont, COO for the nonprofit, said.\nThe sales by Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation could be an early warning sign for San Francisco\u2019s affordable housing sector.\nTenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation \u201cis the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Malcolm Yeung, executive director of local nonprofit landlord San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown Community Development Corporation, told the Chronicle. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a \u2018them\u2019 thing; it\u2019s a \u2018we\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Kingston was the first upstate municipality to adopt rent stabilization in New York, but it\u2019s becoming a symbol of how challenges to the designation remain strong.\nThis week, Mayor Steve Noble vetoed a Common Council resolution to maintain rent stabilization in the city, the Times Union\nreported\n. The Common Council\u2019s resolution from last week to declare a housing emergency was unanimous, setting up a clash and potential veto override.\nData disputes are driving the debacle. A city vacancy study found rates in buildings covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act at 7.04 percent\nthis spring\n, above a 5 percent limit required to declare a \u201chousing emergency\u201d and keep rent caps in place. But the Council pointed to a 4.55 percent citywide vacancy rate.\nNoble said the Common Council\u2019s resolution, which cites the 4.55 percent vacancy rate determined by an independent consultant hired by the city\u2019s Office of Housing Initiatives, \u201cmisconstrues aspects of the 2025 vacancy study and contains several factual errors.\u201d Namely, the city\u2019s report did not calculate a city-wide vacancy rate and the consultant only analyzed nine properties for its study.\nLast August, the state\u2019s Court of Appeals\nrejected\na challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overreached by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings, allowing the reduction to stand and opening the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nThe 2022 and 2025 city vacancy studies did have different methodologies, though. The recent city survey differed in its approach, using \u201ctargeted sampling\u201d that excluded some large complexes.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments; exemptions and rehab projects have cut that to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum. A compromise deal with that unit threshold in mind is on the table, but has not been pursued.\nCouncil members and tenant advocates slammed the mayor\u2019s veto \u2014 which can be overruled with a two-thirds majority \u2014 while the director of a landlord group supported the move.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A private country club in South Florida has become an epicenter of high-stakes global diplomacy.\nDelegations from at least nine nations convened over the weekend at Shell Bay Club, the ultra-exclusive Hallandale Beach club co-owned by developer Steve Witkoff, for parallel negotiations on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to\nAxios\n.\nWitkoff\n, who joined President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in January as the president\u2019s lead negotiator on both conflicts, has used Shell Bay as an off-the-record meeting ground for world leaders and envoys. While based part-time in Washington, he has reportedly flown at his own expense to European and Middle Eastern capitals to advance talks on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nShell Bay\u2019s luxury and privacy has proven convenient for discreet discussions far from the scrutiny of Washington and the international media. The members-only club, which opened in 2023 with reported initiation fees exceeding $1 million, sits about an hour south of Trump\u2019s home, the private Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago, and a short drive north of Miami Beach.\nWitkoff\u2019s eponymous firm is leading a handful of major projects in South Florida, including the redevelopment of the\nShore Club\nArt Deco hotel property in Miami Beach, and developing\nOcean Terrace\n, a project in the same city that entails a condo-hotel and a renovated historic hotel.\nWitkoff and Ocean Terrace partner, Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Real Estate, also own a 200-acre mixed-use development site in West Palm Beach that includes the\nBanyan Cay Resort &amp; Golf Club\n. Witkoff sold his stake in his company for\n$120 million\nin September.\nShell Bay\u2019s role in global affairs traces back to the drafting of Trump\u2019s first Ukraine peace proposal in November, when Witkoff and\nJared Kushner\n, the president\u2019s son-in-law, hosted Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Weeks later, Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov flew to South Florida to review the plan. Subsequent rounds of talks brought U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, European national security chiefs, and Middle Eastern officials to the same club grounds.\nThis past weekend\u2019s meetings reportedly involved separate sessions for Ukraine and Gaza peace efforts. U.S. envoys met European, Ukrainian and Russian representatives across three days.\nMeanwhile, the Qatari prime minister, Egypt\u2019s intelligence chief and Turkey\u2019s foreign minister met with Witkoff and Kushner to coordinate the next steps of the Gaza deal, including establishing a new Palestinian governing body.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "The city of San Jose has given the green light to the development of two twin housing towers in the heart of downtown.\nCity planning administrators approved a proposal from Westbank to build two towers at 35 South Second Street for a total of 768 residential units, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The location is currently home to a parking lot.\nOne tower will rise 28 stories and the other will be 27 stories tall. The two-tower housing project will also have 10,700 square feet of ground-floor retail,\u00a0 26,100 square feet of space for residential lobbies and amenities and four levels of underground parking. The residences will include landscaped balconies and alternating outdoor rooms and balconies. Rooftop terraces are also part of Westbank\u2019s vision for the buildings.\nThe approval answers a yearslong question about what Westbank would ultimately end up building on the site. In 2021, the Vancouver-based Westbank proposed building a single\n750,000-square-foot curving tower\nwith 368,000 square feet of office space on 10 floors and 194 residences on another 10 floors.\nIt\u2019s not the first project in\ndowntown San Jose where Westbank has pivoted\nfrom offices to housing as demand for office space lags.\nIn August, the firm submitted revised plans for 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development.\nIn October 2024, Westbank unveiled its proposal for three\n30-story housing towers\nwith 1,147 units at 300 South First Street and 345 South Second Street. A few months before that, Westbank swapped out an approved plan for a 14-story office building at 255 West Julian Street in downtown San Jose for an\n18-story residential tower\n.\nWestbank is also in development on a 17-story apartment highrise at 23 Terraine Street in downtown San Jose. That proposal calls for an apartment tower on 1.6 acres with 12,000 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants as well as a nine-story parking garage for 621 vehicles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Colorado investor is doubling down on Dallas offices, snapping up one of the largest buildings along the North Central Expressway at a steep discount that highlights just how far values have fallen.\nDenver-based Real Capital Solutions acquired Walnut Glen, an 18-story, class-A office tower at 8144 Walnut Hill Lane, for $26.1 million, the firm announced on Monday. The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat the deal pencils out to a more than 64 percent discount from the building\u2019s 2016 sale price of $73 million.\nThe 464,000-square-foot building is about 49 percent leased, according to the broker, JLL, and equates to about $56 per square foot. That vacancy, combined with broader distress in the office sector, has helped reset pricing even for large, well located buildings. For tax purposes, the Dallas Central Appraisal District still values the tower at $72.2 million.\nIntercontinental\nReal Estate Corporation of Boston owned the property for nearly a decade after buying it from a local investment group. Built in the late 1980s, Walnut Glen is a familiar presence along the freeway, anchored by a massive glass atrium facing North Central Expressway.\nReal Capital Solutions\nplans a value-add strategy. The\nfirm\nsaid it will invest heavily in upgrades to the lobby, fitness center and conference center and roll out move-in-ready office suites aimed at attracting tenants seeking shorter decision timelines and turnkey space. The company declined to disclose the size of its capital commitment to the outlet, but described it as substantial.\nAdam Abeln, Real Capital Solutions\u2019 chief acquisitions officer, said in a statement that the tower \u201cchecks every box\u201d in terms of what the firm is looking for in a purchase to create value, such as its scale and location.\nThe acquisition marks the firm\u2019s second Dallas office play in under a year. Last December, Real Capital Solutions bought\nTower at Park Lane\n\u2014 another North Central Expressway property \u2014 for $66 million, a signal that the firm is concentrating its Texas bets along the same high-visibility corridor.\nThat conviction isn\u2019t entirely contrarian. Dallas-Fort Worth is leading the nation in office demand, outpacing markets like New York and Houston, according to recent CoStar data. Net absorption totaled 3.3 million square feet through the third quarter, or about 0.8 percent of total inventory \u2014 the highest share in the country. Traditional office leasing in Dallas-Fort Worth is on track for its strongest year since 2019, according to the CoStar report.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Democratic Socialist for mayor. Three casinos. New rules for residential brokers. The demise of member deference.\n2025 was a consequential year of political and policy shifts that will affect the real estate industry.\nThe big one, obviously, is that New York City will have\na new mayor\ncome January 1. Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani wasn\u2019t the first or even second choice for many in the industry. In fact, many\nrallied\nbehind former Gov. Andrew Cuomo ahead of the June primary, pouring millions of dollars into political action committees backing his campaign.\nWhen Cuomo lost, some\njumped ship\nto Mayor Eric Adams, hoping he could gain momentum after\nescaping\nfederal corruption charges. But as polls showed him in\nfourth place\n(behind Republican Curtis Sliwa) and charges continued to pile up against his\ninner circle\n, he\ndropped\nout of the race in September.\nSome in the industry have\nfound hope\nin Mamdani\u2019s commitment to building more housing and to exploring ways to reduce costs for landlords, including through potential property tax reform and alternative insurance methods. Still, owners are wary of this pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. That promise may be complicated by Adams\u2019\nlast-minute appointments\nto the Rent Guidelines Board, though Mamdani will be able to replace all of the Adams appointees in 2027.\nTwo weeks before the primary, the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE, Act\nwent into effect\n. The law transformed how residential rental brokers work in the city, requiring whoever hires brokers to pay their commission. The Real Estate Board of New York\nfiled a lawsuit\nchallenging the law soon after its passage, alleging that it violates the First Amendment rights of brokers and landlords because it discourages the publishing of rental listings. The group has an\nappeal\nof a federal court\u2019s dismissal of that claim pending before the Second Circuit.\nIn last year\u2019s\nend-of-year newsletter\n, I said 2024 was a big year for Yimbys. This year also included some major wins for pro-housing folks. Voters approved four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, three of which allow certain projects to either bypass City Council approval or appeal rejections from the body. The changes do not completely kill member deference (the City Council tradition of voting on land-use issues according to the wishes of the local member), but weaken it considerably. The creation of an appeals board also\nelevates\nthe role borough presidents play in zoning approvals.\nThis will be a dynamic we\u2019ll be following closely, as well as the further rollout of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the federal government\u2019s\nexpansion of low-income housing tax credits\nand how all of these initiatives affect the volume of development.\nMeanwhile, on their way out the door, City Council members approved several bills that some see as the Council\u2019s way of reasserting its authority over housing policy following the approval of the ballot measures. The Council approved a\npackage of housing bills\nthat set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances. One of the bills creates minimum wages for construction workers on certain projects.\nThe Council also approved the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA\n, which gives city-approved nonprofits and joint ventures first dibs on buying distressed multifamily buildings. Landlord groups have warned that the measure will slow down deals and scare away potential investors.\nThe mayor has called the measures\nshortsighted\n, but it\u2019s not clear if he will veto the bills.\nIf the bills become law, housing groups have warned that they will add millions of dollars to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs or will result in thousands of fewer housing units being built each year.\nThis year also saw the conclusion of the years-long competition for three downstate casino licenses. Community Advisory Committees eliminated half of the competitors, and after MGM Resorts\ndropped\nits bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-blown casino, only three proposals were left to vie for the up to three state licenses available. The state Gaming Commission\nagreed\nto issue licenses to Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s Queens Aqueduct.\nWe\u2019ll be watching the progress of these projects \u2014\u00a0and the various\npromises\nmade by the casino teams \u2014\u00a0over the next year.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Speaking of things we\u2019re watching: President Donald Trump\nmet with\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in November, and the two highlighted multiple points of agreement, including the need for more housing. In fact, Trump said of the incoming mayor: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor. I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.\u201d Will this sentiment last? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Wild horses in Australia are called brumbies.\nProgramming note:\nThe newsletter is taking a break from Dec. 24 until Jan. 5. Thank you for reading, and have a safe and happy holiday!\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Council member Erik Bottcher announced on Monday that he will not run to replace Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the 12th Congressional District,\nCity &amp; State reports.\nInstead, he plans to run for Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s state Senate seat. (Hoylman-Sigal is leaving the state legislature to become Manhattan borough president.)\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday tapped Lillian Bonsignore as the next commissioner of the Fire Department of New York. Bonsignore previously served as the FDNY\u2019s chief of EMS operations.\n\u2014 In a groundbreaking ceremony that was more of an announcement of when to expect an actual groundbreaking, city and state officials on Tuesday said demolition work on the future site of the Science Park and Research Campus (SPARC) in Kips Bay will begin in February 2026. Construction of the campus is slated to begin in 2027.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$28.5 million\nfor a 9,704-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 50 United Nations Plaza in Turtle Bay. The Zeckendorf Marketing team had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$28 million\nfor a 42,592-square-foot industrial property at 75 Onderdonk Avenue in Maspeth.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$4 million\nfor a 3,720-square-foot, two-family home at 308 Clermont Avenue in Fort Greene. Ari Harkov, Christian George Emanuel and Warner Lewis with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 20,185-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 3822 Sedgwick Avenue in Kingsbridge Heights. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Sinai Gross.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-12-23T23:00:00",
        "content": "A dispute between an investor and the special servicer on a loan has spilled out into court.\nSpecial servicer Rialto Capital Advisors is being sued for allegedly trying to keep a borrower unnecessarily in default, a situation that would result in more fees earned by the servicer but would sting other loan certificateholders. The investment firm 400 Capital Management, an investor on the loan, filed the suit in New York on Tuesday.\nIt\u2019s the latest legal challenge for one of the nation\u2019s largest special servicers by volume. As of June, Rialto was the named special servicer on more than 5,000 loans with a total unpaid principal of more than $94 billion, according to Morningstar. About $24 billion of that principal is associated with loans in active special servicing. The plaintiffs are asking a judge to restrain the servicer from acting on its plan.\n\u201cThis is totally outside the norm of what\u2019s expected in the industry,\u201d Daniel Hendler, an attorney for the plaintiff with McKool Smith, said of Rialto\u2019s proposal.\nAt the center of the complaint is a piece of Herald Square real estate, 215 West 34th Street and 218 West 35th Street. The borrower, associated with Jenel Real Estate, took out $130 million on the property in 2015.\nThe loan is set to mature January 6, 2026. But the borrower hasn\u2019t been able to refinance and get the funds needed to pay off its debt. That\u2019s in part because two key tenants will see their leases expire in the next two years.\nThe loan was sent to special servicing in October and then missed a payment in November. But the property is stable, the plaintiff says. Net operating income is more than double its debt service payments, the property is fully leased and has about $6 million in annual excess cash flow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly improper for Rialto to treat a performing loan as being in default,\u201d the complaint reads.\nRialto has proposed extending the loan by two years, with an option for a third year. Although this would typically be considered a loan modification, 400 Capital wrote in its complaint, Rialto has allegedly proposed calling the agreement a \u201cforbearance agreement.\u201d That would keep the loan in special servicing with Rialto, allowing the servicer to collect more in fees and nearly $10 million in default interest on top of regular payments, according to the complaint.\n400 Capital argues Rialto\u2019s plan is unusual in that it would allow the servicer to essentially cut the line \u2014 privileging payouts to itself, like servicing fees and default interest, over payments toward the principal.\n\u201cWhat a special servicer really should do in the case of a distressed loan is manage it in a way that will maximize the recovery of the loan for the trust that it services,\u201d Hendler said. In this case, he said, that would mean taking the excess cash flow to pay down the principal of the loan, increasing its creditworthiness.\n\u201cInstead, what Rialto is proposing to do with that excess cash flow is put it in its pocket,\u201d Hendler said.\nRialto did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, in a letter to the plaintiff provided in court exhibits, the servicer said it\u2019s entitled to the default interest by its agreements. Its plan would also mean excess cash would be kept in an account and out of the borrower\u2019s hands, meaning more security for the loan.\nRialto, through its investment affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s\nlargest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes\n. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nThe servicer has gained a reputation for aggressive techniques. New York landlords who borrowed from the since-collapsed Signature Bank have accused the company of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing\u201d defaults,\nThe Real Deal reported earlier this year\n.\nThe company has responded that it is playing by the rules, only exercising rights in rare cases, and remains committed to borrowers.",

        "content": "Coral Rock Development Group scored a $54 million construction loan for a Live Local Act project in Miami\u2019s\nAllapattah\n.\nDevelopers across South Florida have seized on the state workforce and affordable housing law by filing a flurry of proposals, but few have advanced their projects to the financing and construction stage.\nCoral Gables-based Coral Rock plans to start construction in the first quarter on the eight-story, 227-unit Dulce Vida apartment building on a 1.3-acre site at 1785 Northwest 35th Street, according to the developer\u2019s news release. Citibank is the lender.\nThe capital stack for the $85 million project includes $15 million from the City of Miami\u2019s Miami Forever Affordable Housing Bond,\u00a0 structured as a 30-year loan, and tax credit equity provided by Affordable Housing Partners. The Citibank debt represents 63.5 percent of the project cost.\nThe\nLive Local Act\n, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, incentivizes developers to include below-market rate apartments in their projects by allowing them to build bigger than a site\u2019s zoning permits and awarding them property tax abatements. At least 40 percent of units have to be reserved for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income for at least 30 years.\nAt Dulce Vida, all apartments will be priced at affordable or workforce rents: 40 percent of units will be for households earning up to 60 percent of the AMI, 35 percent for those earning up to 100 percent of the AMI and 25 percent for earners of up to 120 percent of AMI, according to the release. The building will consist of 70 studios, 128 one-bedroom units and 29 two-bedroom units.\nThe site is now home to a parking lot and the Allapattah Branch Library. Dulce Vida will include an 8,500-square-foot library, replacing one that was completed in 1963. The City of Miami, which owned the property, conveyed title to Coral Rock, according to a company representative.\nThe firm \u2013\u2013 led by\u00a0 David Brown, Michael Wohl, Stephen Blumenthal and Victor Brown \u2013\u2013 first revealed plans for\nDulce Vida\nin 2023.\nCoral Rock is among the developers who\ntapped\nthe Live Local Act for tax breaks on completed apartment buildings. Many started construction or completed projects before the law was passed, and then converted a portion of their units to workforce-priced rentals to obtain the property tax abatements. The savings have been well-received as landlords face higher costs for insurance, management and unit renovations.\nCoral Rock lowered rents for some apartments at the 204-unit Metropolitan in Coral Springs to get Live Local tax abatements. It also qualified the 260-unit\nPura Vida\ncomplex in Hialeah, though it didn\u2019t have to lower rents because they already were at rates for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI.\nAmong other advanced Live Local projects are Beacon Hill Property Group\u2019s 112-unit complex in Princeton, and Daniel Abreu\u2019s 80-unit building near North Miami that scored a\n$16.5 million\nconstruction loan last year.\u00a0Nearly\n3,200 below-market rental units\nin 23 Live Local projects have been completed across Florida since the law was approved, according to Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute.\n",

        "content": "A sprawling Chicagoland apartment complex with a history as a chocolate factory once again traded since its last sale two years ago.\nDallas-based\nS2 Capital\n, a real estate investment manager, said it paid $93.7 million for the Ovaltine Court apartment complex, a 344-unit garden and loft-style multifamily community in Villa Park, a western suburb of Chicago. It marks the firm\u2019s first investment in the greater Chicago area, according to a press release.\nS2 funded the acquisition with a $60 million loan from Starwood Capital. The purchase price breaks down to $273,256 per apartment.\nS2 paid 29 percent more than the complex\u2019s last sale price In 2023, when San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital sold it to New York-based\nOsso Capital for $73.1 million\n, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nStockbridge, for its part, purchased the apartments a decade earlier for $58 million and spent $1.6 million on upgrades in that time period, records show.\nOsso, led by former Blackstone executive Olivia John, also invested in the complex, funneling $785,000 in improvements and upgrades since 2024, according to a JLL marketing brochure.\nOriginally converted in 2001 from the historic Ovaltine Chocolate Factory that was built in 1917, the complex features loft-style layouts, 9-foot to 15-foot ceiling heights, and architectural character rarely found in suburban Chicago, according to the release.\nThe Ovaltine factory was the centerpiece of economic activity in Villa Park until it closed in 1985. The community is in DuPage County, a supply-constrained submarket with no new multifamily units currently under construction.\nMonthly rents at the Ovaltine Court range from $2,000 to $2,800, and the complex has maintained average occupancy above 95 percent since Osso stepped in, JLL\u2019s marketing brochure states.\nS2\u2019s acquisition\nis a major foray into the U.S. market, following several years of evaluation and underwriting across the Chicago region, according to the release.\nCole Stephens, S2 Capital\u2019s managing director of asset management, residential, said in a statement that demand drivers such as the apartments\u2019 historic character and tight rental market were among the reasons for the purchase.\nWork is still needed on the complex. About 98 percent of the units remain unrenovated or only partially upgraded, providing S2 with the opportunity to \u201cexecute a comprehensive renovation program aimed at driving rental growth and enhancing resident experience,\u201d according to the release.\nFounded in 2012, S2 has acquired more than 51,000 units nationwide with deals totaling more than $13 billion, the release shows. The purchase was made through\nS2\u2019s fully discretionary\nclosed-end fund, S2 Real Estate Fund II.\nInvestors have poured roughly $4.8 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties this year, already surpassing 2024\u2019s full-year total of $3.9 billion, and marking the strongest volume since $5.9 billion traded in 2022, according to CoStar data.\n",

The Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the analysis puts fresh numbers behind a debate that\u2019s lingered for years.\nThe study found that renovating the\nAstrodome\nto \u201cbasic operational functionality\u201d \u2014 stopping short of full historic preservation or modern venue upgrades \u2014 would run about $752.6 million. Demolition, by contrast, would cost roughly $55 million, covering teardown and debris removal while leaving the below-grade structure untouched until a future use is determined.\n\u201cThese cost estimates illustrate that it will not be financially feasible for Harris County to renovate the Astrodome without significant private investment,\u201d interim County Administrator Jesse Dickerman said in a statement.\nThe timing is no accident. HCSCC approved the study amid ongoing, high-stakes lease negotiations at\nNRG Park\nwith the Houston Texans and the\nHouston Livestock Show and Rodeo\n, whose agreements both expire in 2032. The fate of the long-shuttered Dome is a central piece of those talks, though county officials said there\u2019s no timeline for a final decision.\nHouston-based\nKirksey Architecture\nprepared the analysis, which was expanded last November and delayed beyond its original early-2025 delivery. That expansion drew sharp criticism from the Astrodome Conservancy, the nonprofit pushing to repurpose the structure, according to the publication. The group blasted the county for spending more public dollars on demolition scenarios, arguing the Dome\u2019s status as a protected Texas landmark warrants a more aggressive reuse strategy.\nThe conservancy has its own numbers. In November, it unveiled a $840 million vision to convert the Astrodome into a mixed-use complex with an arena, retail and multiple buildings inside the existing shell. The plan hinges on a public-private partnership, with $270 million in public funds for the arena and roughly $570 million from private capital for commercial components. Historic tax credits could offset up to 45 percent of the total cost, according to the organization.\nPublic opinion appears to tilt toward reuse. A University of Houston survey last summer found 62 percent of Harris County voters support using public funds as part of a public-private partnership to redevelop the Astrodome into an entertainment and mixed-use destination.\nBut support from key stakeholders is missing. Neither HCSCC, the Texans nor Rodeo Houston has endorsed the conservancy\u2019s proposal, and Rodeo Houston has been openly skeptical. CEO Chris Boleman told the outlet NRG Park\u2019s broader needs are \u201ca $1 billion problem\u201d that goes well beyond the Dome itself, and that the rodeo simply doesn\u2019t use the Astrodome.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas is the king of ultra-luxury homes in Texas. Most of the top residential sales statewide this year \u2014\nthe public deals, at least\n\u2014 took place within a few square miles around Southern Methodist University.\nThis year, though, a market shift throughout the\nSun Belt\narrested the ascent that Texas metros have enjoyed since the pandemic. While Texas is a non-disclosure state, it came to light this month that the top two residential sales of the year, both in Dallas, sold below asking price, raising questions about the cheaper homes on the list.\nMeanwhile, suburban Plano made its way into the ranking, challenging the reign that Preston Hollow and the Park Cities have held over Texas luxury sales for years.\nHere are the year\u2019s top 10 public residential deals in the Metroplex.\n6601 Hunters Glen Road, Dallas | $30.5 million\nThis University Park home\nwasn\u2019t just the most expensive sale in Dallas-Fort Worth; it was the most expensive sale in Texas, according to listing agent Alex Perry with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and the Houston Association of Realtors. It\u2019s also the oldest home and one of the fastest sales on this list.\nNotably, the home\u2019s final sale price of $30.5 million was $4.5 million below the\noriginal asking price of $35 million\n, Perry disclosed.\nThe University Park mansion built in 1927 went under contract in just 30 days after\nlisting\non Oct. 31. The sale closed on Dec. 15. The seller was a trust connected to the late Josh Pack, the Fortress Investment Group CEO who died this year, and the buyer is a trust organized by a local Dallas family, according to Perry.\nThe sale price equates to about $2,300 per square foot.\n4000 Euclid Avenue, Dallas | $25.5 million\nThe second-place sale\naccepted a far bigger discount. The 19,000-square-foot, six-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue, owned by manufacturing businessman Guinn Crousen,\nlisted for $33 million\n, but sold on Dec. 3 for $25.5 million, about $1,300 per square foot. The buyer is the Maui Kiki Trust, whose only public trustee is the buyer\u2019s agent, Compass Real Estate\u2019s Genna Skolnik.\n1 Dorset Place, Dallas\nA spec mansion asking $23 million\nwas the third most expensive home to sell in the Metroplex this year, squeaking in close behind the top two. Just two days after the late Pack\u2019s home sold in December, local entrepreneurs Sardar and Rida Sharif sold their 15,700-square-foot, six-bedroom, eight-bathroom mansion to Tu and Alex Dao, CEO and president of Plano-based Orthomed Anesthesia. Both sides purchased through trusts in their names. The final sale price is unavailable, but the listing price comes down to about $1,500 per square foot.\nJonathan Rosen with Compass Real Estate had the listing.\n4307 Armstrong Parkway, Highland Park\nUniversity of San Francisco trustee and Fisher Investments vice chairman, Jeff Silk, and his wife, Naomi Silk, bought the four-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 4307 Armstrong Parkway from James and Rosemary Strode when it was asking $20 million, about $1,900 per square foot. The property first listed in October 2024 and toggled on and off the market until the purchase in May. Compass agent Michelle Wood had the listing. The sale price was not disclosed.\n3917 Gillon Avenue, Highland Park\nCustom homebuilder Colby Craig sold this 10,000-square-foot spec mansion asking $16.5 million, or about $1,600 per square foot, in January to an LLC managed by Plano estates attorney Toby Eisenberg. Gina Lester with Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International represented the mystery buyer, and Ebby Halliday agent Danielle Brasher represented the seller. The sale price was not disclosed.\n5222 Park Lane, Dallas\nA trust managed by Melissa McMahan sold the 15,000-square-foot property on over an acre, asking $16 million, at 5222 Park Lane to Arizona investors Larry and Maria Smith in July. Eric Narosov of Allie Beth Allman and Associates had the listing. The sale price was not disclosed.\nThe seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom house is in prestigious Old Preston Hollow. Park Lane neighbors include the former homes of oil tycoon Cary Maguire, which briefly\nlisted for $28.5 million\nearlier this year, and entertainment agent to the stars Gary Osier, who recently\nsold his property\nafter listing it for $11.7 million.\n5805 Red Wolf Lane, Plano | $15.9M\nWith a sale price of $15.9 million\n, the outlier on this list reportedly set a record for Collin County residential deals. Matt Rutledge, founder of Woot.com, sold the property to BuzzBalls founder Merrilee Kick and her family.\nThe Kicks bought the 12,300-square-foot home for about $1,300 per square foot in May. The house is on a 6.75-acre lot, which includes a private lake, a lighted tennis court and a guest house.\nMarking another outlier on a list dominated by Allie Beth Allman and Compass, Keller Williams agent Kari Schuveiller represented the buyer. The Perry-Miller Streiff Group at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate had the listing.\n10006 Hollow Way Road, Dallas\nThis home\n, asking $14.9 million, was one of several spec mansions developed by Crescent Estates founder Mehrdad Moayedi on land formerly belonging to the\nCrespi Estate\n, a manor at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane which remains the most expensive listing in Texas. Moayedi bought the Crespi Estate at auction for $36.2 million in 2017 and replatted some of the property\u2019s acreage for a luxury subdivision.\nAlmost 2 acres went to this 11,400-square foot, seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion, which sold in September to Hector Martinez Martinez. Dave Perry-Miller agents represented both sides of the deal. The listing price comes down to $1,300 per square foot.\nFrom January to February, Moayedi had the home listed at $15.9 million. The sale price was not disclosed.\nToday, the original Crespi Estate is asking $64 million.\n3906 Shenandoah Street, Highland Park\nA trust in the name of Randall Kendrick, founder of\nXebec Realty Investments\n, bought the 9,100-square-foot home at 3906 Shenandoah Street from developer Hugh Uhalt in July when it was asking $14 million, or about $1,500 per square foot. Uhalt built the four-bedroom, five-bathroom home on 0.37 acres in 2021.\nThe sale price was not disclosed.\n10335 Lennox Lane, Dallas\nStanding out from the French traditionals that dominate the list, the\nsteel-and-stone contemporary at 10335 Lennox Lane\nwas built by Atrium Fine Homes this year. Rohan Thambrahalli and Melonie Carnegie, husband-and-wife founders of fintech app Growvana, purchased it in July when it was asking $12.3 million, or about $1,000 per square foot.\nIt was also the only home on this list to cut its asking price. The sellers, Dallas physicians Hooman and Tannaz Sedighi, had listed the property in February for $13.7 million.\nThe sale price was not disclosed.\n",

        "content": "An elite lakefront corridor north of Chicago had most of the top luxury residential sales in Chicagoland this year, with some\nNorth Shore homes\nreaching values never before seen in Illinois.\nSix of the seven most expensive single-family home sales this year took place on a three-mile stretch of Sheridan Road between Winnetka and Kenilworth. Two of those homes, both in Winnetka, sold for more than $30 million, marking the most expensive homes sold in Chicagoland history.\nAnd one agent, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, was on one or both sides of all six of those North Shore deals. The preeminent dealmaker for the North Shore\u2019s coveted lakefront properties, Radnay was the sixth-highest selling agent in Cook County in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s 2025 rankings\n, with $213 million in sales across 41 transactions.\nThe concentration of top-tier sales in the North Shore is a change from\nrecent years\n, when neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast and Streeterville dominated the list. The deals are also getting bigger. In 2024, three deals cleared $10 million, and in 2023 it was four. This year, the top six deals in Cook County all closed for more than $10 million.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market took off in 2025, as strong stock market returns drove wealthy buyers toward real estate, and scarce inventory sharpened competition for trophy properties. In Cook County, 105 sales were over $4 million between October 2024 and October 2025, according to research by\nThe Real Deal.\nThe run of luxury success is likely to continue into 2026. Billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s last Chicago property \u2014 the top-floor penthouse at the Park Tower \u2014 is under contract with a\n$12.5 million list price\n. And a spec mansion on the lake in Kenilworth is looking to beat the record in that village,\nasking nearly $17 million\n.\nHere are the most expensive home sales in Cook County of 2025, based on\nTRD\u2019s\nresearch.\n609 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $32.5 million\nJust months after a neighboring mansion set the all-time record for a Chicagoland home sale, this 16,000-square-foot mansion snatched the crown with a\n$32.5 million off-market deal\nin November. Jeff Quicksilver, a co-founder of Walton Street Capital, and his wife Ashley Quicksilver, who owns a local fashion boutique, sold the French provincial-inspired estate.\nThey built the home in 2017 after tearing down the previous home on the 1.6-acre site. The design was led by architecture firm Northworks, with interior design by Kara Mann. The Quicksilvers bought that previous home for $8 million in 2013.\nRadnay represented both the Quicksilvers and the buyer, who has not yet been identified. The deal also included about $2 million in personal property included in the house.\n419 Sheridan Road, Winnetka\n| $31.3 million\nThis 13,894-square-foot lakefront estate held the title of Chicago\u2019s priciest home resale for a few months, after selling for $31.3 million in August. Retired Goldman Sachs partner Muneer Satter and his wife, Kristen Hertel, sold the property. The estate features 223 feet of private beach, a boathouse and an infinity pool.\nThe\nseven-bedroom mansion\n, built in 1928 and designed by architect Ernset Mayo, underwent significant renovations under Satter and Hertel\u2019s ownership. The couple first purchased the property in 2002 and bought an adjacent parcel in 2013. They spent\ntens of millions on renovations\nand additions on the estate.\nRadnay represented both sides of the deal. The buyer was not identified in public records.\n219 Sheridan Road, Kenilworth | $14.5 million\nThis 1907 Colonial Revival mansion traded for\n$14.5 million in October\n, becoming the most expensive home ever sold in Kenilworth. Built by Paul Starrett \u2014 the man who designed the Empire State Building \u2014 the 8,280-square-foot home was sold by designer Yoanna Kulas.\nKulas, who bought the home built in 1906 in 2020 for $4.5 million, renovated and modernized the interior while preserving its historic features. The renovations were led by architect Michael Abraham and luxury designer Mick De Giulio.\nRadnay represented both Kulas and the unidentified buyers in the deal, which closed at nearly 97 percent of its asking price.\n973 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $12 million\nThis seven-bedroom coastal-style mansion kicked off the summer\u2019s high-end frenzy when it sold for $12 million in June. The\n9,650-square-foot home\nis decked out with amenities including a basketball court and golf simulator. It sits on a bluff with 100 feet of private beach.\nThe sellers were a trust associated with Luke and Margaret Kelly. They built the home in 2020 on the 1.75-acre site that they purchased for $6.19 million in 2017. John Baylor and Cricket King of @properties represented the seller, while Radnay brought the buyer. The home was bought under a land trust that obscured the new owner\u2019s identity.\n765 Sheridan Rd, Winnetka | $11.4 million\nThis\n15,800-square-foot lakefront\nhome sold for $11.4 million in July. The seller, Morris Silverman, bought the land for nearly $6 million in 2003 and finished the massive home in 2005. Silverman initially asked $18 million for the home in 2024, but cut the asking price to just under $12 million in February.\nThe interiors feature heavy detailing, including a Chagall-inspired mosaic ceiling and beveled mahogany floors. Outside, the property has a pool, an outdoor kitchen and 100 feet of private beach.\nRadnay represented the seller, while Annie Flanagan of @properties represented the buyer, who isn\u2019t identified in public records.\n4 E Elm Street, PH23, Chicago | $10.1 million\nThe only Chicago property to sell for more than $10 million in 2025, this\nfull-floor penthouse in the Gold Coast\nsold for $10.1 million in March. Former Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari and his wife, Kate Carbonari, sold the 5,400-square-foot unit, which they bought as raw space in 2016.\nThe unit features panoramic views and a 12-foot-high glass wall that opens to a balcony. Sharon O\u2019Hara and Carrie McCormick of @properties represented the sellers, while @properties\u2019 Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers.\nOther condos downtown have failed to crack $10 million this year, as the neighborhood has struggled to regain property values that dipped over the last few years. The closest was a penthouse at the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive that sold for $9.25 million in October to Siri cofounder Dag Kittlaus.\n381 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $9.6 million\nThree doors down from the second-priciest home of the year,\nthe mansion at 381 Sheridan Road\nbrought in $9.6 million when it sold in June. The home\u2019s seller was Tom Day, CEO of Reyes Beer Division, who bought it for $7 million in 2022 from Neil Fitzpatrick, co-founder of quantitative trading firm Headlands Technologies.\nThe 8,100-square-foot Neo-Georgian home includes a theater, gym and sports simulator. Radnay represented the sellers, while Grace Flatt of @properties represented the buyers, who are not identified in public records.\n",

        "content": "The billionaire sheen of\n220 Central Park South\nis getting scuffed by a decidedly unglamorous neighbor dispute this holiday season.\nGainsborough Studios, the landmarked 1908 co-op next door at 222 Central Park South, is suing Vornado Realty Trust over damage allegedly caused by years of heavy-duty construction at the ultra-luxury supertall, the New York Post\nreported\n. The co-op is seeking at least $3 million to cover repairs it claims Vornado agreed to pay for but refuses to reimburse.\nThe allegations paint a vivid picture of what happens when a 70-story tower rises beside a 16-story historic building.\nExcavation for 220 Central Park South began in 2014 with blasting through bedrock to create three underground levels about 50 feet below grade, according to the complaint filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. By the end of that year, Gainsborough\u2019s building had shifted downward and eastward, twisting nearly an inch at the top, per the complaint.\nThat movement, the suit claims, triggered a cascade of problems: cracked foundations, broken windows, chipped skylights, air conditioning issues and damage to the historic facade.\nWhile the repairs have since been completed, Gainsborough says it paid the costs itself despite agreements signed in 2008 and 2014 that required Vornado to cover construction-related damage.\nResidents and board members didn\u2019t mince words.\nOne longtime resident told the Post the building was \u201cbasically\u2026molested by the whole thing,\u201d while board president Tod Williams, whose architecture firm occupies the ground floor, said the blasting \u201cfelt like a seismic shift\u201d and forced workers to wear noise-canceling headphones for more than a year.\nVornado disputes responsibility. In court filings, its attorney said any damage was caused by \u201cintervening acts of third parties,\u201d not the developer\u2019s work. Vornado declined to comment to the publication.\nThe stakes are modest by Billionaires\u2019 Row standards. Gainsborough\u2019s $3 million claim is a rounding error compared to the roughly $3.5 billion in sales at 220 Central Park South, which cost about\n$1.5 billion to build\n. The tower is home to nine of the 20 most expensive residential sales in New York City history, including Ken Griffin\u2019s record-setting $238 million purchase and an\n$82.5 million deal this year\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The partners filed an application with Miami-Dade County\u2019s Shoreline Development Review Committee, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMiami Beach-based Prosper is led by Jay Roberts. Roberts and Torrealba tapped Revuelta Architecture International to design the tower.\nThe project is slated to have 3,300 square feet of restaurant space, 6,400 square feet of offices and\n12 guest rooms\nfor condo owners. Units will range from 1,000 to 2,700 square feet, spanning one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Four four-bedroom penthouses will span between 2,500 and 3,800 square feet, each with private pools.\nThe tower will also have a pool and an amenity deck.\nNorth Bay Village\nemerged as a hotbed of condo development in recent years. Earlier this month, developer Vivian Dimond\nlanded $67 million in construction financing\nfor Tula Residences, a waterfront condo project that had previously stalled out under developer Pacific &amp; Orient Properties.\nAlso in North Bay Village, Related Group and Macklowe Properties are planning\na Ritz-Carlton-branded complex\nwith two 43-story buildings with 364 condos. And Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons is planning a 30-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\n.\nTorrealba, who started MG a decade ago, has a project pipeline of more than $500 million across South Florida. In July, he landed\n$39 million\nin construction financing for a 13-unit Coral Gables townhome development. In April, he\nscored a $105 million construction loan\nfor a planned 10-story, 347-unit apartment building in Hialeah.\nEarlier this year, Prosper\u2019s Roberts partnered with Versluys Group on\na planned $650 million luxury condo tower\nin Brickell. The 60-story, 158-unit project will have 300 feet of waterfront along the Miami River.\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "A\nBrentwood\nmansion billing itself as a private sanctuary on about an acre lot turned the heads of a prospective buyer to land the No. 1 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts.\nThe 11,000-square-foot residence at 1504 North Kenter Avenue hopped into the top spot on the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, with a $25.9 million asking price that pencils out to $2,260 per square foot.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County homes in the Multiple Listing Service asking $4 million or more.\nAcross the county, 14 properties went into contract last week, adding up to $142.2 million in asking volume, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Compared to the year-ago period, that\u2019s four fewer contracts. Still, the total asking volume last week was up over 20 percent from a year earlier.\nThe priciest deal featured a 2024 new build that was designed by architect Richard Landry\u2019s Los Angeles-based Landry Design Group. The residence features a spiral staircase, floor-to-ceiling glass walls, elevator and primary suite with its own terrace.\nRecords show a limited liability company managed by attorney David Shladovsky bought the property in 2020 for $2.9 million, or $253 per square foot.\nWhen the completed six-bed, 10-bath residence first hit the market last June, it sought $30 million. It went off and on the MLS after that, seeing price cuts along the way. The most recent price change to $25.9 million was in September.\nAaron Kirman and Cindy Ambuehl of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California hold the listing.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest home to go into contract, based on the listing price, was in Beverly Hills at 1335 Carla Lane.\nThe\nTrousdale Estates\ncontemporary home spans about 11,000 square feet and is asking just under $20 million, or $1,817 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s been on and off the market since 2023, when it was first listed for nearly $22 million.\nThe home last traded in 2020 for $16.8 million, according to listing sites.\nA Delaware LLC called Stella Properties is the seller, with the shell company managed by a registered agent in Century City, according to state records.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni and Branden Williams hold the listing.\nHighlights include a glass bridge at the entrance, two-story courtyard, Japanese garden, wellness center and home theater.\n",

        "content": "A veteran San Francisco developer wants to put new condo supply back on the table near Oracle Park after years of false starts downtown.\nDavid O\u2019Keeffe, working with San Francisco\u2013based Stanton Architecture, has floated plans for a 33-story condominium tower in South Beach, a block away from Oracle Park, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The proposal calls for 260 units at 329 Bryant Street, a half-acre site currently occupied by low-rise commercial buildings.\nPlans submitted to the city show a slender tower rising above two historic structures that would remain in place, alongside three levels of parking, said Stanton Architecture\u2019s Stephen Allen.\nO\u2019Keeffe, a longtime player in the neighborhood, picked up the four parcels that make up the site from Fortress Real Estate Advisors for $7.3 million in October 2024. His past projects nearby include the Hotel Via across from Oracle Park and a 44-unit condo building on King Street, both developed before the city\u2019s residential pipeline largely froze during the pandemic-era downturn.\nTo unlock extra height and density, the project would include 40 affordable units under California\u2019s density bonus law, a now-standard trade-off for developers trying to pencil new housing in San Francisco.\nStanton Architecture said the condos are aimed at the mid-to-upper market rather than the ultra-luxury tier that once dominated new towers near the waterfront. Unit sizes would range from sub-500-square-foot one-bedrooms to three-bedroom homes topping 1,100 square feet, offering a broader mix than many pre-pandemic condo projects.\nNew ground-up residential development in San Francisco has been scarce as developers grappled with falling rents, weak buyer demand and stubbornly high construction costs. In recent months, however, some architects and landowners have\nbegun dusting off plans\n, betting that improving market sentiment could support new starts. Still, more than 20,000 homes have been approved citywide but little has been built, with developers sidelined by high interest rates and construction costs as capital instead chases existing apartment deals, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nover the weekend.\nThat makes the timing\u00a0 fluid. A final application is expected next year, with the construction schedule hinging on city approvals and whether San Francisco\u2019s fragile residential recovery continues to firm up. For now, the proposal could stand as another signal that local developers are cautiously reentering the ring.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

BridgeCity Capital provided the financing for the 14-story development.\nThe financing comes at an 80 percent loan-to-cost ratio. The term is for 18 months with multiple options for extensions.\nBridgeCity director of originations EJ Ehrlich said in a statement that the deal reflects a \u201ccommitment to financing high-quality, ground-up projects where strong sponsorship and market fundamentals intersect.\u201d Southside did not respond to a request for comment.\nLast spring, Schwartz\nfiled plans\nfor a 117-unit multifamily project at the site.

The site is zoned for shorter buildings than what Southside is proposing. Schwartz is also asking planning officials to waive a parking requirement for the lot.\nHe received approval from the City Planning Commission in June, according to BLDUP.\nSchwartz acquired the property in 2022 for $3.7 million. The site is near Concord Street and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway overpass, as well as Flatbush Avenue.\nSchwartz\u2019s recent projects include a 12-unit rental project at 596 Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg and a 27-unit project at 352 Meeker Avenue.\nIn 2023, Schwartz\npaid $12.9 million\nfor a development site at 203-209 North 11th Street in Williamsburg, where Yisroel Greenfeld previously planned a 53-unit apartment building; Omny Associates was the seller in the deal.\nBridgeCity and Deutsche Bank recently provided Bushburg with\na $320 million construction loan\nfor the partial office-to-residential conversion of the 1.2-million-square-foot property at 80 Pine Street in the Financial District.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Faced with fire damage, frozen permits and a City Hall she says can\u2019t scale, a Pacific Palisades developer has made a radical pitch a year after the destruction: break away from Los Angeles.\nSanta Monica-based developer and reality TV alum Elaine Culotti is pushing for the Pacific Palisades to secede from the City of Los Angeles after losing roughly 20 percent of her real estate portfolio in the January fire, the Santa Monica Daily Press\nreported\n. Culotti argues the city\u2019s disaster response exposed deeper structural failures that threaten property values, rebuilding timelines and insurability across fire-prone hillside neighborhoods.\nIn the days after the blaze, Culotti said state and local officials touted debris-clearing capacity that appeared robust until she realized the figures applied to all of California, not Los Angeles County or the Palisades specifically. As residents struggled through conflicting guidance and opaque timelines, Culotti said it became clear the city lacked the logistical capacity to handle a disaster of that scale.\nCulotti\u2019s, who starred on Discovery\u2019s \u201cUndercover Billionaire,\u201d makes the call after she devised an alternative debris-removal strategy dubbed \u201cDebris on Rail.\u201d It would have moved fire waste from the Palisades, Malibu and Altadena via rail lines to a processing facility in Puente Hills. The plan, she said, was vetted with FEMA, the governor\u2019s\u00a0 emergency services office and the Army Corps of Engineers and even pitched to federal appropriations staff in Washington. California ultimately declined to adopt it.\nCulotti took the rejection as an indicator that the size of Los Angeles\u2019 government has made it unwieldy to respond effectively to crises. She says the breakdown has direct consequences for real estate, from stalled permits and frozen valuations to mounting carrying costs for owners unable to rebuild, rent or sell damaged properties.\n\u201cHow do you value real estate if you can\u2019t sell it, rent it, repair it, or build on it? How do you keep paying mortgages, security, maintenance, brush clearing, insurance with no path forward?\u201d she told the Daily Press. \u201cNo industry can survive like that. And no homeowner should be asked to.\u201d\nHer answer is municipal divorce. Culotti is advocating for the Palisades to become its own city, with local control over infrastructure, emergency response and rebuilding. She is also working to establish a community center to serve as a civic hub, though she claims even that effort has run into resistance from city agencies.\nNo major neighborhood has successfully seceded from an existing large city like Los Angeles in modern times. But nearby examples like West Hollywood, which\nincorporated\nin 1984, and Malibu, which\nfollowed\nin 1991, show how affluent, civically engaged communities have used cityhood to seize control of zoning, development and environmental rules. Those took years to organize, but ultimately reshaped local real estate outcomes for decades.\nThe secession push comes as wildfire risk, insurance pullbacks and rebuilding delays increasingly shape land values across Los Angeles\u2019 hillside markets. That pressure has only intensified as the Los Angeles City Council has moved to\nforcibly clear the last uncleared Palisades fire lots\nnearly a year after the blaze as prolonged cleanup timelines stall rebuilding and prolong uncertainty for owners and lenders alike.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Trader Joe\u2019s just made a pricey Santa Monica land play, snapping up a former Rite Aid along Wilshire Boulevard as it continues to expand in Southern California and scoop up drugstore boxes left behind by bankrupt chains.\nThe Monrovia, California\u2013based grocer paid $22 million for the 17,800-square-foot property at 1331 Wilshire Boulevard, or about $1,236 per square foot, according to public records cited by the\nLos Angeles Times\n. The site, which sits on roughly 1.4 acres with about 125 surface parking spaces, was sold by a private owner.\nThe deal is another example of the growing reuse of Rite Aid locations, which began to flood the Southern California market after the pharmacy chain filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in two years in May.\nThat month, Rite Aid put more than 1,200 owned and leased stores\nup for sale nationwide\n, including 59 in Los Angeles County alone, with A&amp;G Real Estate Partners marketing the portfolio. At the time, brokers described the sales process as fast-moving, with grocers and value retailers among the most aggressive bidders.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has been one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers leaning into that churn. The company recently surpassed 600 stores nationwide and has steadily added locations in California, where competition for well-located grocery sites remains fierce despite broader retail softness. In December, Trader Joe\u2019s opened a new store in the Orange County municipality of Costa Mesa, and earlier this year it disclosed plans to\nopen nine additional locations\nacross SoCal, from the San Fernando Valley to San Diego County.\nRecent market trends explain the disconnect.\nSanta Monica retail rents have eased but remain high in prime corridors, with average asking rents slipping from about $5.50 to $4.47 per square foot per month while deals on Montana Avenue, Main Street and Wilshire Boulevard continue to close north of $5 and as high as nearly $10 per foot, according to a CoStar-sourced\nreport\nfrom Illi CRE. At the same time, vacant available retail space has more than doubled to roughly 635,000 square feet since it began rising in mid-2023, punctuating softer overall fundamentals while reinforcing that well-located, grocery-anchored sites still draw aggressive pricing.\nSecond-generation drugstores with parking, visibility and neighborhood-serving zoning that can be quickly converted into smaller-format grocery stores have fit that pattern. Those boxes have become especially valuable as ground-up retail development\nremains constrained\nby high construction costs and entitlement hurdles.\nFor landlords and lenders sitting on empty or soon-to-be-vacant Rite Aid sites, Trader Joe\u2019s move is another sign that the best-located assets will clear, even at premium pricing. For everyone else, the scramble to backfill thousands of former pharmacies is still just getting started.\n\u2014\nJudah Duke\n",

The couple were the buyers of the Kenilworth deal that closed in late October, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nJeffrey Quicksilver is a co-founder of Walton Street Capital, one of Chicago\u2019s most prominent real estate investment firms. His wife, Ashley Quicksilver, owns Athene, a high-end women\u2019s boutique in\nWinnetka\n. Together, they used a land trust to purchase the Kenilworth property at\n219 Sheridan Road\n, masking their identities until now \u2014 a tactic also employed by the still unknown buyers of their record-setting Winnetka estate.\nThe Kenilworth home sits on roughly a half-acre with 115 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and comes with a lineup of outdoor amenities, including a boathouse, fire pit area, glass-enclosed patio and multiple terraces. Records show the Quicksilvers have already explored zoning relief to add a swimming pool on the bluff\u2019s land and have expressed interest in adding a bathroom to the existing boathouse.\nBuilt in 1914, the three-story mansion was developed by\nPaul Starrett\n, the legendary builder behind the Empire State Building and the Lincoln Memorial. The six-bedroom home has been fully restored, blending preserved architectural details \u2014 original moldings, oak floors and custom wrought-iron railings \u2014 with modern upgrades, including new mechanical systems, windows, a smart home platform and zoned climate control.\nHighlights of the interior work include a primary suite with a custom wardrobe room featuring leather accents, along with a lower level outfitted with a wine cellar, theater, catering kitchen and wellness center complete with sauna, steam room and massage space. The $14.5 million price tag also included roughly $500,000 worth of furniture and personal property, according to records.\nJena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represented the Quicksilvers in both deals and confirmed to Elite Street their role as the Kenilworth buyers.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about a down-trade,\u201d Radnay told the outlet. \u201cIt was an up-trade. The Kenilworth mansion was a smaller scale but the same level of exquisite finishes.\u201d\nThe seller of the Kenilworth home was Yoanna Kulas, founder of design firm Caladrius Studio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Align Real Estate cleared a major hurdle in its bid to remake one of San Francisco\u2019s most controversial grocery sites into housing.\nThe developer behind the Marina District Safeway redevelopment has secured labor agreements with San Francisco\u2019s powerful building trades, a move that brings its 25-story, 790-unit\nproposal\none step closer to approval under a state streamlining law, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe deal positions Align to formally file the project under AB 2011, a California statute designed to fast-track housing on commercial sites in exchange for strict labor and environmental standards.\nThe project would replace the decades-old Safeway at 15 Marina Boulevard with a new grocery store topped by nearly 800 apartments, including about 86 affordable units.\nThe scale has\nfueled fierce opposition\nfrom Mayor Daniel Lurie, Supervisor Stephen Sherrill and neighborhood activists. Critics argue the tower far exceeds local zoning and clashes with the mayor\u2019s newly adopted \u201cFamily Zoning\u201d plan, which seeks to guide growth in historically low-density neighborhoods like the Marina.\nAlign counters that state housing laws trump local rules. By locking in union backing from the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council and the NorCal Carpenters Union, the developer can invoke AB 2011\u2019s accelerated approval timeline, potentially forcing the city to sign off within months rather than years. The law was written explicitly to sidestep protracted local fights that have stalled housing production across San Francisco.\nThe Marina proposal is just one pilot piece of a broader bet.\nAlign and Safeway have floated\nsimilar mixed-use redevelopments\nat four major grocery sites citywide, totaling roughly 3,500 apartments, with additional locations under consideration. The push has made Safeway-owned land a new front line in San Francisco\u2019s housing wars.\nStill, uncertainty looms. Align has not disclosed financing details or a construction timeline, and city officials have signaled they plan to scrutinize the project closely, despite the state law\u2019s limits on local discretion.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "One of the Austin area\u2019s\nfastest-growing suburbs\nis trying a lighter touch approach to economic development: speed.\nThe Hutto City Council voted Dec. 18 to fast-track what it calls \u201ceconomically impactful development,\u201d adopting a policy that promises a 10-business-day review period for permits tied to industrial and commercial projects. The resolution takes effect Jan. 1 and applies across all permit types tied to those projects, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nResidential developers won\u2019t see a change. Single-family and multifamily projects will continue to follow Texas\u2019 standard 30-business-day review timeline. Instead the city\u2019s focus will remain on job creation and commercial tax base growth rather than more rooftops.\nThe move arose from a November meeting of the\nHutto Economic Development Corporation\n, whose board unanimously approved a letter urging the City Council to adopt the policy. In that letter, the EDC argued that shaving weeks off permitting timelines would make Hutto more competitive in attracting employers and private capital, accelerate the delivery of job-producing projects and signal a more responsive posture to developers and business operators.\nThe city appears to be positioning speed as a substitute for subsidies. Unlike many of its peers in the Austin metro, Hutto has generally avoided large incentive packages and tax abatements, opting instead for smaller, targeted efforts \u2014 such as backing a local bookstore and coffee shop with a $32,000 sales tax abatement to help with retrofitting a historic home for the enterprise \u2014 and process-driven enticements, according to the publication. Faster permits come with a price tag of zero.\nThat restraint is partly strategic. Hutto, about 30 miles northeast of downtown Austin with a population of roughly 43,000, has been grappling with infrastructure constraints, including water capacity, after years of rapid residential growth. Prioritizing industrial and\ncommercial projects\nallows the city to balance its growth mix without opening the incentive spigot.\nThe policy also arrives as the city looks to reset after a pair of high-profile development setbacks. Houston-based Midway Companies\u2019 contract to redevelop the 250-acre\nCottonwood Tract\ninto a mixed-use destination was terminated earlier this year. Separately, Georgetown-based Headwater Commercial Realty scrapped plans for a 242,000-square-foot industrial project on EDC-owned land.\nCity officials have said interest in replacing both projects remains strong, and the new permitting policy reads like a signal to would-be suitors that Hutto is serious about cutting friction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mars is gearing up for a major office expansion in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market, teeing up what could be one of the neighborhood\u2019s larger recent leases as it absorbs snack giant Kellanova.\nThe McLean, Virginia-based company has tentatively reached an agreement to lease a large block of space at the building at\n400 North Aberdeen Street\n, according to people familiar with the deal. If finalized as expected, the lease would likely exceed 100,000 square feet and further cement Mars\u2019 presence in Chicago following its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 16-story building\u2019s biggest contiguous space availability is roughly 170,000 square feet, according to CoStar data, putting Mars in position to anchor a sizable portion of the building.\nMars recently completed its acquisition of Kellanova, the Chicago-based spinoff from Kellogg that houses brands including Cheez-It, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats and RxBar. Kellanova had been headquartered in a boutique office building at 412 North Wells Street in River North, while Mars already operates a significantly expanded office and research campus on Goose Island.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the\nFulton Market\nspace would consolidate employees from those locations or serve as an additional hub. Mars has been touring large blocks of downtown Chicago office space, according to people familiar with the search, suggesting a broader rethinking of its post-acquisition space.\nIn a statement to the outlet, a Mars spokesperson declined to confirm the deal, saying the company does not comment on speculation about real estate transactions and is \u201calways evaluating investments and optimizing office space\u201d across its U.S. portfolio. Trammell Crow, the Dallas-based landlord of the building, also declined to comment.\nMars has also eyed space under construction by competing developer Fulton Street Companies at\n919 West Fulton Street\n, which could still be in the running should the Aberdeen Street tower deal fall through.\nThe Aberdeen Street building is one of two\nFulton Market\nproperties branded as Fulton Labs by Trammell Crow, a concept pitched to tenants spanning traditional office, life sciences and research-and-development uses. Tenants already in the building include a research hub backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Illinois Institute of Technology and chemical products firm Mattiq. Battery startup Pure Lithium recently moved its headquarters there from the Boston area.\nCompleted in 2022, the building was about 51 percent leased before accounting for the Mars deal, according to CoStar.\nThe potential lease would mark a second major Chicago investment by Mars in just a few years. In 2022, the company announced a roughly $40 million expansion of its Goose Island office and research campus, billed as its largest innovation hub globally. That project opened in early 2024.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That would smash the local record, a nearly $13 million sale on the waterfront two years ago.\nThe modernist home was designed more than a half-century ago by famed architect Norman Jaffe. The 5,100-square-foot, six-bedroom home is on a nearly two-acre property off of Gardiner\u2019s Bay.\nBroughman and his then-partner, British media entrepreneur Waheed Alli, purchased the property from the Osofsky family in 2020 for more than $7.1 million. They renovated the home, built specifically for the Osofskys, for two years after its acquisition, preserving much of the architecture.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money was spent on renovations, which included relocating the kitchen and installing a bar at the former kitchen location. Broughman primarily used the property for weekends and summers.\nAmenities include a chef\u2019s kitchen, a private gym, a movie theater, a tennis court with pickleball lines and a detached two-car garage. There\u2019s also a heated gunite pool, an outdoor pergola with a kitchen and fireplace and a separate guest wing.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nick Brown and Lidia Murphy have the\nlisting\n, which breaks down to $3,529 per square foot.\nThe Shelter Island sale record was nearly broken earlier this year when a deal for the newly built One Pandion Road went into contract with\na $15 million ask\n. The purchase ultimately closed at $12.85 million, however, according to\nBehind the Hedges\n.\nOne Pandion was developed by High Line Properties\u2019 Joshua Greenwald, who bought the land for $3.25 million in 2021. Greenwald completed construction last October and rented the home for $475,000 from Memorial Day through Labor Day.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bidding opened earlier this month with a $72 million bid. The reserve bid was $70 million, a spokesperson for the real estate auction house said.\nA Miami federal bankruptcy court hearing to finalize the sale is set for Jan. 9.\nThe site at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to the 200-key Holiday Inn Port of Miami-Downtown, is owned by two entities managed by Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny. His entities paid $65 million for the property in 2015. The 10-story hotel dates to 1950, records show.\nThe owner before Bomeny secured city approvals for a project dubbed\nRegalia on the Bay\n. Designed by Arquitectonica, the 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower was planned to include 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nThe Bomeny entities filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby the Cirrus affiliate that alleges the site\u2019s owners defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nJudge Isicoff also authorized closing the Holiday Inn upon execution of a purchase agreement, with the hotel\u2019s franchise license set to end on Jan. 5. Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions will receive a $750,000 fee.\nCirrus appears anxious to close the deal, according to a motion filed this week by the firm\u2019s attorneys. Five days after the auction ended, Bomeny\u2019s entities had not finalized the purchase and sale agreement, the motion states.\n\u201cThe delay disrupts the entire sale process to Cirrus\u2019 detriment,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe debtors have four business days after the PSA is fully executed to file a motion seeking approval of the sale. Given the intervening holidays, absent immediate execution of the PSA, the motion will not be filed in time to provide Cirrus the court-mandated notice and time to respond.\u201d\nHowever, emails attached to the motion show that the real estate attorney for the Bomeny entities asked for more time due to the death of a close friend whose funeral service was on Monday.\nBomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid\u2013designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower in downtown Miami, and\nRegalia Residences\nin Sunny Isles Beach.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s tourism bureau and downtown hotel owners are backing an unusual play to boost demand: taxing themselves.\nA resolution to begin creating a Tourism Improvement District, funded by a 1.5 percent surcharge on hotel stays, surfaced at the Chicago City Council just minutes after lawmakers approved the city\u2019s 2026 budget on Saturday, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The proposal would generate an estimated $43 million a year for marketing campaigns and financial incentives aimed squarely at landing large conventions and trade shows that fill hotel rooms.\nThe push is being led by\nChoose Chicago\n, which has quietly spent more than a year lining up support from hotel owners. Backers say they\u2019ve secured sign-off from at least 60 percent of affected properties, comfortably clearing the state-required threshold to move forward.\nThe surcharge would apply to hotels with at least 100 rooms within a defined district that includes the central business district, South Loop, McCormick Place and the\nIllinois Medical District\n. Unlike traditional hotel taxes, the money would not flow into the city\u2019s general coffers. Instead, it would be controlled by a new board representing hotel owners, with Choose Chicago administering the program.\nKristen Reynolds, who took over as CEO of Choose Chicago in April, told the outlet that the additional funding is critical if the city wants to compete with peers that routinely offer subsidies to lure major events. Choose Chicago\u2019s current $33 million budget trails rivals by a wide margin. Orlando tops $100 million annually, while Las Vegas approaches $500 million.\nThe plan has the backing of Mayor Brandon Johnson, and supporters hope to clear legislative hurdles by March. Alderman Jason Ervin, who introduced the resolution at the tail end of the council meeting, could tee up a vote as early as January. If approved, a public hearing would follow before a separate ordinance codifies the surcharge.\nThe proposal isn\u2019t without risk. Adding the 1.5 percent assessment would push Chicago\u2019s combined hotel tax rate to about 19 percent, the highest in the country. Proponents argue the added cost will be offset by\nstronger demand\ndriven by better marketing and incentives. Michael Jacobson, president of the Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, told the publication that more than 200 U.S. markets already use similar districts.\nThere\u2019s also a political angle. By letting the industry self-assess, the plan could make it harder for future administrations to justify raising the city\u2019s own hotel tax. Jacobson framed it as a win for alders citywide, noting hospitality workers from every ward depend on\ndowntown\ntourism.\nEven if approved early next year, the impact won\u2019t be immediate. Revenue collection and distribution lags mean the spending boost could take at least a year to materialize. Still, with Chicago logging more than 55 million visitors last year, boosters say standing still isn\u2019t an option in an increasingly competitive convention landscape.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bay Area leaders may be cutting red tape, but new jobs data shows the cranes still aren\u2019t coming back.\nConstruction hiring across the Bay Area stayed sluggish over the past year, belying local officials\u2019 pushing for zoning, permitting and environmental reforms to jump-start development, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing an analysis of federal labor data by the Associated General Contractors of America. It\u2019s a clearer signal of how far the region still sits from a full construction rebound despite the mounting political momentum to build.\nFrom September 2024 to September 2025, the San Francisco\u2013San Mateo\u2013Redwood City metro added roughly 1,200 construction jobs, a gain of about 3 percent. That increase lagged many large US metros, while other parts of the Bay Area fared worse. Construction employment barely budged in San Jose and declined outright in Oakland, Fremont and Berkeley.\nNationally, construction employment\ngrew\n, up roughly 33,000 jobs year over year, marking the first year-over-year gain below 100,000 in four years. The national gains were largely concentrated in infrastructure, manufacturing and data-center hubs rather than in coastal housing markets.\nRoughly half of US metro areas added construction jobs over the same period, led by markets like Washington, DC, Charlotte and Boise, where those kinds of projects are driving steady work. The Bay Area\u2019s development slowdown, meanwhile, continues to weigh on employment amid acute demand for housing and commercial space.\nSome of the reforms Bay Area leaders and Sacramento pushed during that period were\nsignificant on paper\n, including strengthened\nBuilder\u2019s Remedy\nenforcement,\nexpanded permitting\nunder SB 35 and other laws aimed at speeding approval for housing when cities fail to meet state mandates.\nBut developers and builders say those changes have yet to translate into enough shovel-ready work to buoy hiring numbers. Contractors, according to the Business Times, say the job numbers mirror reality on the ground.\nHospital projects and public-sector work have provided some stability, including a recently completed $176 million health campus in San Mateo County. But private commercial and market-rate multifamily construction has been scarce. Builders expect San Francisco to lead any rebound, with modest workforce growth potentially picking up in 2026, followed later by Silicon Valley as more projects come off the sidelines.\nThe timing matters. Construction employment is often a lagging indicator, but it\u2019s also one of the sharpest signals that projects have cleared financing hurdles and regulatory reviews. Still, the numbers won\u2019t show the impacts of Los Angeles\u2019 historic Family Zoning Plan passed\nthree weeks ago\n, for example, for some time.\nLabor market experts, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, have flagged that the federal government may be overstating job gains further still \u2014 by\nas much as 60,000 a month\n\u2014 after the October government shutdown paused the reports for months. Fed officials have cut rates this year precisely because labor data suggest hiring has slowed and downside employment\nrisks have risen\n, a dynamic that could temper any construction rebound in 2026.The data suggests that while Bay Area policymakers have made it easier to say yes to development, it may still take years (and lower costs, or better capital markets) before those approvals translate into sustained building and jobs.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A path to disbanding homeowners associations for residents unhappy with their HOAs is part of a proposal ahead of next year\u2019s session of the Florida Legislature.\nRep. Juan Carlos Porras filed House Bill 657, another legislative attempt to address HOA problems and help residents clashing with their leadership. But experts on association law say the proposal would cause more problems than it solves.\nThe proposal also calls for creating a Community Association Court Program to focus solely on disputes arising at condo associations and HOAs, a way for these cases to work their way through the courts faster and alleviate the backlog of such litigation.\nAcross the state, homeowners living in communities governed by associations for years have raised complaints of\nwrongdoing\nagainst board members, and in some cases also against the\nattorneys and management firms working for HOAs\n.\nAllegations have varied, with homeowners often claiming HOAs are withholding records and provide little transparency for assessment increases, as well as problems such as election interference, misappropriation of funds, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case unraveled at the\nHammocks HOA\nin West Kendall, where police arrested four former board members and a fifth person on charges they siphoned close to $4 million from association coffers, according to criminal and civil court filings. The Hammocks, which consists of condos, single-family homes, townhomes and apartments on 3,800 acres and is home to about 18,000 residents, is South Florida\u2019s biggest HOA and second-largest in the state after\nThe Villages\n.\nProsecutors in the Hammocks HOA case claimed ex-board members hired contractors that did little to no work at the Hammocks and then diverted the payments to themselves. Two former board members pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators, and the rest of those charged have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\nUnder Porras\u2019 proposed legislation, a resident seeking to dismantle an HOA would start by filing a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners. The board must then schedule a meeting within 60 days and set the rules for a vote on the termination, which would require approval by two-thirds of homeowners.\nThe HOA would be required to submit its plan of termination to the court and, if approved, to select a termination trustee, either the board or an appointed trustee, to wind down the association\u2019s affairs, including any pending litigation and debts, and sell off or dispose of the HOA\u2019s assets.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nIn a statement to\nWJXT\nin Jacksonville, he said it\u2019s time for \u201cthe conversation if homeowner associations are really needed.\u201d\n\u201cIn my opinion, they act more as a failed experiment. They\u2019re a quasi-elected pseudo-government that have more power and are entitled to more rights than I think most cities and counties do,\u201d he told the news station.\nBut attorneys who specialize in HOAs said disbanding them won\u2019t be easy, and likely won\u2019t work at all. HOAs own common areas, including pools, tennis courts, lakes, playgrounds and clubhouses, but more important, the roads, gates, landscaping, lighting, sewage and flood control infrastructure such as retention ponds.\nAlthough some assets, such as landscape trucks, could be sold as part of the dissolution plan, infrastructure would be harder to dispose of.\n\u201cThe association has \u2026 obligations to the common areas,\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets? Who is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nAttorney William Sklar said the bill\u2019s termination clause \u201cwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\nMost Florida counties and municipalities have laws on their books that require for multi-home developments to include HOAs that will own, maintain and insure the infrastructure, said Sklar, of Carlton Fields. HB 657 essentially would go against these existing laws, which would necessitate a massive overhaul of regulations.\nLocal governments\u2019 mandate for the creation of HOAs for multi-home developments makes sense, he added. Because many of these communities are gated, the roads, stormwater and sewer systems are only used by the residents in an HOA.\n\u201cIf I am Miami-Dade County and you want to create 100 lots with 100 homes, I don\u2019t want everyone in Miami-Dade County to pay for that internal road,\u201d said Sklar. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the rest of [the county], so why should the citizens of Miami-Dade pay for every little community\u2019s roads or access?\u201d\nComplicating matters is that some HOAs consist of townhomes that share roofs. Disbanding an HOA may mean homeowners would have to agree on how to divide the maintenance bill.\n\u201cHow are they going to dissolve and maintain the roof?\u201d said Sheir, of Eisinger Law. \u201cHow do you informally split up the tab?\u201d\nUnder state law, HOAs already have a dissolution process. Every 30 years they have to vote on whether they want the association form of government to continue, said Travis Moore, a lobbyist with the Community Association Institute, a trade organization for managers, attorneys, contractors and other service providers to associations.\nPorras\u2019 \u201cinitial thought was to dissolve all HOAs and make them CDDs [\nCommunity Development Districts\n] or other kinds of quasi-governments,\u201d Moore said. But that \u201cis weird because then the developers get to be a local government except they aren\u2019t elected.\u201d\nSheir took issue with another clause in the bill: Starting July 1, each newly formed HOA has to include a statement in its governing documents that it\u2019s governed by the Florida Condominium Act. It would require existing HOAs to hold a meeting to decide whether to also include this statement in their declarations.\n\u201cHe is basically turning every HOA into a condo, which makes no sense,\u201d she said.\nCondo associations and HOAs are fundamentally different, attorneys said. For one, in a condo association, each unit owner has a percentage ownership share in common areas, and in an HOA, the association owns the common areas.\nAttorneys hailed the bill\u2019s call for a Community Association Court, however.\n\u201cI have personally heard from chief judges of several circuits \u2026 say to me, \u2018We don\u2019t need these covenant cases, mailbox color cases. We need to take them out of the circuit courts.\u2019\u201d Sklar said. \u201cSo this is a good alternative.\u201d\nFor both condo associations and HOAs, the bill removes the requirement for presuit mediation, allowing residents to directly file claims with the Community Association Court. Residents at condo associations still also have the option to file for arbitration through the state administrative process.\nHB 657 isn\u2019t the only upcoming bill aiming to reform associations. SB 906, sponsored by Sen. Ileana Garcia, calls for the creation of a state ombudsman for HOAs, after a similar proposal at this year\u2019s legislative session\nfizzled out\n.\nFlorida\u2019s legislative session starts Jan. 13.\n",

        "content": "A lender is placing a bet on suburban retail, as rooftops keep piling up west of Houston.\nDelray Beach, Florida-based\nForman Capital\nclosed a $37.1 million construction loan for The Oaks of District West, an open-air retail, restaurant and entertainment project planned in Richmond, about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The loan, which closed last week, backs a development led by\nFerguson Family Partners\n, led by Bobby and Corey Ferguson, according to a press release from Forman.\nThe project will be built on roughly 10 acres at 21711 FM 1093, fronting the Westpark Tollway in a fast-growing residential corridor. Construction is slated to start in the first quarter of 2026, with completion expected in the third quarter of 2027, the release shows.\nThe Oaks of District West is designed as a walkable, suburban town center rather than a strip center. Plans call for about 87,244 square feet of rentable space spread across 10 buildings, anchored by a central green that\u2019s meant to function as a community gathering spot. More than 15 tenant spaces are planned.\nThe center is already about 70 percent pre-leased, according to the release, a level of early traction that lenders have increasingly demanded for speculative retail deals. Houston-based\nWhite House Global Properties\nis marketing the property according to the project\u2019s website.\nAccording to Forman, the tenant mix skews experiential and food-and-beverage heavy, with signed leases including from Grazia Italian Kitchen, Luckie\u2019s Burger, Pacific Coast Tacos, a virtual golf bar, Pecan Jack\u2019s Ice Cream and\nPicklr\n, which is an indoor pickleball concept.\nForman Capital\u2019s Scott Mehlman, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer and a partner, said in a statement that the deal hinges on a simple supply and demand imbalance. Richmond and the surrounding Fort Bend County submarkets have posted years of steady homebuilding, but new retail has lagged behind, particularly projects offering newer design and higher-end dining options.\nThe loan was originated by Mehlman, alongside Brett Forman and Ben Jacobson. Bobby Ferguson said both sides worked through multiple issues to close the deal, citing Forman Capital\u2019s flexibility.\nThe development will be part of Parkway Lakes \u2014 a 1,300-acre master-planned community south of Houston\u2019s Cinco Ranch area in Richmond. The Oaks will be adjacent to a Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Whiskey River country dance hall and a theater opened by Star Cinema Grill.\n",

        "content": "Retail investment in Dallas-Fort Worth is closing the year on a strong note, with an East Texas buyer snapping up one of Plano\u2019s better-known mixed-use centers.\nCTO Realty Growth\nsaid that it sold the Shops at Legacy North for $78 million, or roughly $321 per square foot. The buyer wasn\u2019t named in the release, but Collin County land records show the property was acquired by ACH Legacy North Texas, an entity affiliated with Beaumont-based commercial real estate firm Albanese Cormier Holdings, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal closed on Friday.\nThe 243,000-square-foot property at 7300 Dallas Parkway was completed in 2007 as part of the broader Legacy Town Center area. It\u2019s about 85 percent leased and home to 31 tenants, according to the center\u2019s website. Tenants include Capital Grille, Benihana, Mexican Sugar and Mic Drop Comedy. The mix skews heavily toward dining and entertainment.\nShops at Legacy North traces its roots to the original Shops at Legacy, master-developed by The Karahan Companies under\nFehmi Karahan\n. That project became an early model for building an urban-style, walkable district within an office park setting, helping Plano transform the Legacy corridor into one of North Texas\u2019 most durable mixed-use nodes, according to the outlet.\nFor CTO, the timing of the sale was no accident. The Winter Park, Florida-based real estate investment trust bought the property in 2021 and has spent the past two years backfilling space left behind by\nWeWork\n. At the end of the third quarter, the company signed a 30,000-square-foot lease with a co-working operator slated to open by the end of 2026. That followed a 20,000-square-foot deal last year for a members-only social club, according to comments by CEO John Albright on a recent earnings call, according to the outlet.\nThose leases helped stabilize the center and set it up for disposition. CTO said proceeds from the Plano sale will be redeployed into other investments, including its Dec. 15 acquisition of Pompano Citi Centre, a 571,000-square-foot retail property in Florida.\nAfter unloading Shops at Legacy North, CTO\u2019s only remaining Dallas-Fort Worth holding is the\nPlaza at Rockwall\n, which it bought in 2023.

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-12-25T14:00:00",
        "content": "In 2017, Leon Goldenberg filed an eviction case against a tenant who had stopped paying rent.\nI can\u2019t tell you how the case turned out. More than eight years later, it\u2019s still going.\nThe increasing difficulty of collecting rent is one of the things Goldenberg wishes he had foreseen a decade ago. As the owner and manager of more than 2,500 units, many of them rent-stabilized, he would have gotten out before things got this bad.\nGoldenberg has been\nbuying multifamily\nbuildings in New York City since 1983. He jokes that he now\nowns properties\nin every borough, plus Staten Island.\nA sense of humor helps Goldenberg keep his sanity in a city where everything has gone against rent-stabilized landlords for the past seven years.\nBut there\u2019s nothing funny about the plunge in rent collection that began with the pandemic. Even affordable housing nonprofits have seen collections rates drop by\n5 crucial percentage points\n.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s no reason to pay in New York,\u201d Goldenberg said at a recent\npanel discussion\nin Brooklyn. \u201cAnybody who is a tenant and pays in New York should have his head examined.\u201d\nHousing court is so\nslow\nand frequently unjust that the LeFrak Organization, the city\u2019s largest landlord,\nsued\nto get the courts to meet its statutory deadlines. But the lawsuit went nowhere, proving that those deadlines are not real.\n\u201cYou go to court and the judge says, \u2018Seven months out is your next hearing,\u2019\u201d Goldenberg said.\nThe rough stretch for owners of rent-stabilized buildings began with the\nradical rent law\nof 2019. Then came the pandemic, \u201ccancel rent,\u201d eviction moratoriums, inflation, soaring mortgage rates and insurance premiums,\nderegulation rollbacks\nand, last week, the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n.\nZohran Mamdani, other progressives and even President Donald Trump keep talking about affordability, but the apartment that Goldenberg has been trying to take back from a tenant since 2017 is hardly unaffordable. \u201cOn a $1,000 rent, he still owes me $65,000,\u201d the landlord said.\nAdvocates talk about the need for a strong safety net, but the safety net worked for that tenant: When the pandemic hit, the state\u2019s Emergency Rental Assistance Program paid thousands of dollars of his arrears.\nHowever, as with some\nother rent-aid programs\n, tenants could only get free money from ERAP if they stopped paying rent. It was a perverse incentive, fueled by socialists\u2019 \u201c\ncancel rent\n\u201d movement. ERAP ended, but the notion that rent is optional didn\u2019t.\nUnderlying Goldenberg\u2019s comment that tenants would be foolish to pay rent is a simple fact: People have all kinds of ways to\nlive rent-free\nfor years. One is to repeatedly damage your apartment, then tell housing court you\u2019re withholding rent because the unit needs repairs. Yes, this happens.\nYou can also buy time by calling Adult Protective Services and asking for help. The housing court judge will keep adjourning your eviction case until APS decides what to do. This can buy you a few months.\nDidn\u2019t get free legal counsel from the city? Got a cognitive issue that might justify a guardian ad litem to represent you? Need to care for a sick relative? Tell the court! Judges hand out adjournments like Halloween candy, and city officials will help, because the last thing they want is for tenants to end up in a homeless shelter.\nPerhaps tenants\u2019 most common tactic is to apply for a\none-shot deal\nfrom the Human Resources Administration. The judge won\u2019t kick you out if there\u2019s a chance HRA will come up with money to pay your arrears. If it does, the eviction case will be dismissed.\nThen, after a month or two, you can stop paying rent again and apply anew. Rinse and repeat!\nSome tenants get a one-shot every year. It\u2019s become an annual ritual \u2014 like Christmas, except the gifts come from taxpayers.\nIn theory, you have to pay back your one-shot. Reality check: Tenants living paycheck to paycheck often can\u2019t save thousands of dollars for arrears while also paying rent.\nGoldenberg had 36 good years in the landlord business before the tide turned against him in 2019, so he\u2019s hardly headed for the poor house. But he says 14 percent of all rent-stabilized buildings are in pre-foreclosure or foreclosure, and he expects that to double.\nHis average rent is $1,386 per month. After property tax, water and sewer, heat, mortgage and insurance payments, little or nothing is left. Sometimes less than nothing.\nThe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, he said, \u201chas totally destroyed multifamily, rent-stabilized housing.\u201d But despite the law\u2019s stranglehold on rent, too many tenants still don\u2019t pay. As Goldenberg put it, \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The biggest proposed project of 2025 was not an apartment building or office tower. It was a casino.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s plan for a 3.8 million-square-foot gaming facility near Citi Field was the largest new development for which permits were filed with the city\u2019s Department of Buildings this year.\nTwo city jails, a hospital and a warehouse were also among the 10 largest projects proposed in 2025, an analysis of permit applications by\nThe Real Deal\nshows.\nFour of the top developments were residential, though one was a dormitory for college students. After the approval of the property tax break 485x, developers have increasingly favored apartment projects with 99 or fewer units, to avoid construction wage requirements that kick in at 100 units, and steeper rates at 150 units. That may explain why more residential projects didn\u2019t top\nTRD\n\u2019s list.\nOnly one office building made the cut: Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management\u2019s highly anticipated 350 Park Avenue. The project is a testament to the continued demand for class A, trophy office towers \u2014\u00a0and the importance of lining up an anchor tenant to get such a project off the ground.\nHere are the largest projects filed with DOB:\n121-09 Roosevelt Avenue, Queens\nThe competition for up to three state casino licenses in New York came to an end this month, with state officials\nselecting\nthree winners: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, a facility planned near Citi Field; the complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nOnly Cohen\u2019s $8 billion plan made the list of the largest project filings of 2025 (the other teams haven\u2019t filed applications as of the end of November). The development, which will rise on 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field, is expected to include a 1,000-room Hard Rock hotel and a 5,650-person live music venue.\n350 Park Avenue, Manhattan\nThree years ago, Vornado and Rudin announced that they had reached a deal with Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel that would allow the developers to build a massive office tower in Midtown East.\nSince then, the developers have\nrezoned\nthe site and\npurchased\nhundreds of thousands of\u00a0 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and\nSt. Bartholomew\u2019s Church\n. In November of this year, they\nfiled\na permit application for a more than 2 million-square-foot building that will rise 62 stories.\nGriffin agreed in late 2022 to master lease the site, with Citadel and Citadel Securities set to occupy 850,000 square feet of the new tower. As part of the deal, Griffin has until June 2030 to either buy a majority stake in the joint venture developing the property (with Vornado and Rudin respectively taking a 36 and 4 percent interest) or to buy the site outright for $1.4 billion.\n357 Southern Boulevard/\n745 East 141st Street\n, Bronx\nIn October, the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction filed plans for a new jail at the site of the former Lincoln Hospital and NYPD compound.\nThe facility is expected to span 1.1 million gross square feet, including 1,040 beds, 120 parking spaces and 40,000 square feet of commercial space.\nLast year, the city awarded a\n$2.9 billion design-build contract\nto an entity led by the Sweet Group to build the facility.\n45 West Street and 15 Oak Street, Brooklyn\nTF Cornerstone\nplans\nto build 1,060 residential units across two buildings on this Greenpoint waterfront site. The larger of the two, at 45 West Street, is expected to span 808,000 square feet and include 792 units.\nThe other is expected to have 268 units across 249,000 square feet.\n125 White Street, Manhattan\nThe city\u2019s DDC filed plans for the Manhattan jail in October. DOB filings indicate that the facility, which will be constructed on the site of a current detention center, will span more than 1 million square feet. It is expected to have 1,040 beds, 125 parking spots and 20,000 square feet of commercial space.\nThe city awarded a\n$3.8 billion contract\nto a joint venture led by Tutor Perini to build the facility.\n61-06 Junction Boulevard, Queens\nUnited Construction and Development Group filed plans in August for a two-tower residential project in Corona.\nUpdates filings call for 706 units across the two buildings, which will respectively rise 23 and 29 stories. Together, the projects are expected to span more than 960,000 square feet.\n431 East 66th Street, Manhattan\nA permit application filed for the Kenneth C. Griffin Pavilion at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer in November describes a 730,000-square-foot building on York Avenue between East 66th and East 67th streets. The hospital\u2019s new cancer center will rise more than 480 feet and feature 28 operating rooms and more than 200 patient beds.\nThe cancer center will eventually be connected with the existing hospital by a two-story skybridge.\n376 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn\nAlloy Development says its\nplanned\n730-foot tower on Schermerhorn Street, known as One Third Avenue, will be the world\u2019s tallest passive house. The building is expected to span nearly 640,000 square feet and 583 residential units, of which 143 will be affordable.\nThe developers are\nnot planning\nto apply for the property tax break 485x, but will instead make payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\nThe tower is part of a larger development, dubbed the Alloy Block, which will eventually include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable.\n2768 Webster Avenue, Bronx\nDeveloper Mark Stagg filed plans for a 545,000-square-foot dormitory for Fordham University students in November. The building is expected to include 510 dorms and is part of a broader development that will also feature 485 units of affordable housing.\nThe Stagg Group and Maddd Equities purchased two lots at 2740 and 2768 Webster Avenue for\n$40 million in April\n.\n12-18 38th Avenue, Long Island City\nSan Francisco-based real estate investment trust Prologis filed plans for a 500,000-square-foot warehouse in Long Island City in April.\nThe proposal came as the Adams administration began\nadvancing\na zoning text amendment that would require developers of last-mile facilities 50,000 square feet or larger to first secure a special permit. At the time, Prologis said the timing was a\ncoincidence\n.\nThe Adams administration did not begin the review process for the text amendment, meaning it will be up to the next administration to pick up on the effort.\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group paid a record\n$520 million\nthis week for a Brickell assemblage they plan to develop with a hotel and branded condos.\nIt marked the biggest development site deal in South Florida and likely the state.\nThe pair purchased the 4.25-acre bayfront assemblage consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami. Mariposa Real Estate, which is tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, also partnered on the deal.\nThe seller, Denver-based Aimco, has been unwinding its portfolio for the past year. Led by Wes Powell, Aimco is primarily a multifamily investor that last month announced its\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slowing apartment market nationwide.\nAimco first listed the Brickell assemblage for\n$650 million\nin March of last year.\nOak Row \u2013\u2013 led by David Weitz and Erik Rutter and with offices in New York and Miami \u2013\u2013 put the site under contract a year ago, at the time only revealing Mariposa as a partner. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later.\nIn past ventures, OKO Group has partnered with London-based Cain International on most of its projects, while Oak Row has had various partners for its developments. While Oak Row has primarily focused on apartment projects, OKO has developed condos and hotels. Both target the luxury market. Franklin\u2019s only known South Florida investment is his\n2022 purchase\nof a big minority stake in the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThis is the first known partnership between OKO and Oak Row. Here\u2019s a look at each firm\u2019s South Florida projects.\nOKO Group\n830 Brickell\nIn perhaps their most notable project, OKO and Cain completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year.\nThe building, at 830 Brickell Plaza, benefitted from fortuitous timing because it was under construction during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. The new-to-market firms sought top tier offices and many leased big blocks of space at 830 Brickell, the newest standalone office tower in Brickell in over a decade.\nTenants include Microsoft; law firms\nKirkland &amp; Ellis\nand\nSidley Austin\n; Corient, formerly called\nCI Financial\n;\nThoma Bravo\n; Marsh Insurance and Santander Bank. OKO and The Bastion Collection, a subsidiary of Jamal Daniel\u2019sHouston-based Crest Investment Company, plan members-only club\nSeia\nwith an Italian restaurant on the 54th and 55th floors of 830 Brickell.\nMissoni Baia\nOKO and Cain developed the 57-story\nMissoni Baia\ncondo tower at 777 Northeast 26th Terrace in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nDesigned by Hani Rashid of Asymptote Architecture, the tower with 249 units was the first\u00a0 Missoni-branded residential building in the world at the time of its construction. Since then, the Italian luxury fashion house has branded several projects.\nUna Residences\nThe 47-story Una Residences has 135 condos in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nOKO also partnered with Cain on the tower, at 175 Southeast 25th Road. It\u2019s designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture.\nThe tower is nearly sold out, and completion is expected next year, an OKO representative said.\nAman Miami Beach\nOKO, in partnership with billionaire Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries, plans the redevelopment of the historic Versailles structure in Miami Beach into an\nAman-branded project\n.\nThis year, construction started on the oceanfront project, at 3425 Collins Avenue, that will consist of a 56-key hotel in the Versailles structure, which is now a shell, and a new 18-story building with\n22 Aman-branded condos\n.\nThe project is sold out, and completion is expected in 2027, according to the OKO spokesperson.\nDoronin owns Aman Group, with its investors including Cain.\nPalm Beach Residences\nOKO and Cain have expanded their South Florida activity to Palm Beach.\nOn the barrier island, the pair plan a five-story, three-building oceanfront condo complex. In October, they scored\napproval\nfrom the Palm Beach Architectural Review Commission to demolish the existing condo buildings on the site, the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences, at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard, and Edgewater, at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nDesigned by OMA, the project will include 41 units.\nAt an August meeting in front of the architectural commission, a project representative said the project will be\nbranded by Aman\n, but OKO has denied this will be an Aman-branded development.\nFort Lauderdale\nOKO\u2019s plan for the 34-story, 251-unit One River apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale has stalled, and is the subject of a lawsuit.\nIn a\ncomplaint\nfiled in August, more than 40 investors in the project claimed the developer has failed to advance any \u201cmeaningful construction\u201d and is yet to secure a general contractor, three-plus years after obtaining a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan. The investors sued OKO, FPR Investor, the entity in which investors purchased a membership interest, and FPR US 1, the sponsor manager of FPR Investor. Cain is a partner in the project, and wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\nThe investors allege FPR has been \u201cnothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d according to the complaint.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit.\u201d OKO, FPR Investor and FPR US 1 also denied the allegations in a court response to the complaint.\nOak Row\nWynwood Plaza\nThis year, OKO completed the 1 million-square-foot mixed-use Wynwood Plaza project with a 12-story, 266,000-square-foot office building and a 12-story, 509-unit apartment building. The project is at 95 NW 29th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nThe project partners are New York-based L&amp;L Holding Company, led by David Levinson and Robert Lapidus; San Francisco-based Shorenstein, led by Brandon Shorenstein; and Claure Group, led by Marcelo Claure. Claure is the former CEO of Sprint and SoftBank Group International.\nClaure Group leased a headquarters office at Wynwood Plaza. Amazon also took\n75,500 square\nfeet at the office building. Law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg \u2013\u2013 led by co-founding members Arthur Luxenberg and Perry Weitz, who is David Weitz\u2019s father and an Oak Row investor \u2013\u2013 leased a Wynwood Plaza office. Other tenants haven\u2019t been announced yet.\n2900 Terrace\nIn June, Oak Row scored a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 38-story 2900 Terrace luxury apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nThe 324-unit building is under construction on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue. Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development is partnering on the project.\nCompletion is expected in late 2027.\n2600 Biscayne\nOak Row landed a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan last year for the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne apartment tower, also in Edgewater. It\u2019s under construction at 2600 Biscayne Boulevard.\nMore than half of the 187,000 square feet of commercial space at the tower is pre-leased, with Equinox signing up for\n30,700 square feet\n. Coastal Construction, 2600 Biscayne\u2019s general contractor, pre-leased space at the tower, where it will move its headquarters, and Ferraro Law Firm will move into a 28,000-square-foot office.\nFirst&amp;Fifth\nOak Row scored\napproval\nin January for the First&amp;Fifth apartment tower across the street from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami.\nThe Miami Urban Development Board greenlit the project after taking issue with the tower\u2019s design last year. At the time, some board members\ncalled out\nwhat they said was a mismatch between the five-story podium, which had exterior arches, and the rest of the tower, and the incorporation of the historic Salvation Army Citadel building on the site instead of highlighting the building. The Salvation Army Citadel will be preserved.\nThe tower was approved for 45 stories and 526 apartments, though a recent Oak Row news release said the firm is finalizing the design.\nFirst&amp;Fifth will be at 49 Northwest Fifth Street and 50 Northwest Sixth Street.\nVenus\nIn 2022, before Oak Row had escalated to the upper echelons of Miami real estate, it revealed plans for the 26-story, 440-unit\nVenus\napartment tower in North Miami Beach.\nConstruction of the project, at\u00a0 2050 Northeast 164th Street, hasn\u2019t commenced. Oak Row is advancing in the permitting process, according to the company\u2019s news release announcing the Brickell assemblage purchase.\nThe Oasis\nOak Row\u2019s first known investment in Miami real estate came in 2018, when the firm paid\n$14 million\nfor a 1.7-acre development site at 2335 North Miami Avenue in Wynwood.\nAt the time, the real estate industry paid little attention to Rutter and Weitz, apparent novices in real estate investing. Their firm at the time was called Carpe Real Estate Partners, which they later rechristened to Oak Row, an homage to the oak trees that line the entrance to their Wynwood property.\nThe pair developed The Oasis mixed-use adaptive reuse project on the property, where\nSpotify\nleased space for its South Florida headquarters.\n",

        "content": "Trilogy Real Estate Group landed an $82.3 million construction loan for a planned multifamily tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nChicago-based Trilogy, led by president and CEO Neil Gehani, received the financing from Bank OZK, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. The project, dubbed Edgewater 27, is slated for the 0.6-acre site at 2728 Northeast 2nd Avenue.\nTrilogy is a multifamily development and investment company with a portfolio that spans more than 14 cities. Trilogy\u2019s Gehani is also the founder and owner of the Concours Club in Opa-locka, a members-only car club where entry costs $350,000, according to published reports.\nTrilogy bought the site for\n$12.5 million\nin 2021, records show. Edgewater 27 is set to rise 20 stories, with 247 units and 8,000 square feet of commercial space, the outlet reported. Units will range from studio to three-bedroom apartments, Trilogy\u2019s website shows. The tower\u2019s amenities will include a pool, fitness center, lounge and coworking space. Trilogy tapped Coral Gables-based SB Architects to design the project.\nEdgewater 27 is one in a growing pipeline of projects for Trilogy in the neighborhood. In 2022, the firm dropped\n$30.6 million\non a 1.6-acre site at 2201 Northeast Second Avenue, an Opportunity Zone site, with plans for a 36-story tower. Trilogy is planning another multifamily development, the 369-unit Edgewater 23, for the site.\nIn June, Trilogy acquired Crescent Heights\u2019 Edgewater headquarters for\n$41.9 million\n. They are planning a mixed-use development with condos and apartments on the 2-acre site at 2200 Biscayne Boulevard. The project will rise up to 60 stories with 834 units that will include between 60 and 80 condos.\nEdgewater has been a magnet for development in recent years. In November, Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group partnered with hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian to launch\nHQ Residences Miami\n, a planned 35-story, 229-unit condo tower.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "It may sound like a broken record at this point.\nA look at 2025\u2019s nine priciest deals had Beverly Hills-based Carolwood Estates\u2019 fingerprints all over them. Six of the nine transactions had Drew Fenton\u2019s brokerage involved in representing at least one side. That comes off a\n2024\nwhere Carolwood was involved in half of the year\u2019s 10 priciest deals.\nIn 2025, the brokerage can lay claim to being involved in the year\u2019s record sales of 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills and 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air. Each of the properties fetched $110 million to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s most expensive closings in 2025.\nWhile some have said the year proved to be more challenging in the County\u2019s high end, the following list, compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nResearch, shows what agents were able to still get deals done\u2013with some setting high-water marks while they were at it.\n1. 594 South Mapleton Drive, Holmby Hills | Eric and Wendy Schmidt | $110 million\nIt turns out 2025\u2019s magic number was $110 million.\nThe sale of\nSpelling Manor\nmade for the year\u2019s second trade for that price when it closed in July to tie for the year\u2019s priciest residential sale in Los Angeles County.\nCarolwood Estates double-ended the deal with CEO and co-founder Drew Fenton the listing agent on behalf of a reported Saudi national. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Linda May represented former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt and his wife Wendy\nin their purchase.\nThe Schmidts have plenty of room to work with in their new residence, with over 56,000 square feet. They won\u2019t have to travel far for their daily needs and entertainment. The Manor comes complete with bowling alleys, beauty salons, rose gardens to wander through, library and a professional screening room.\n2. 630 Nimes Road, Bel-Air | James Packer | $110 million\nAustralian billionaire\nJames Packer\nwas so excited over his purchase of the Le Belvedere residence in Bel-Air that he let slip to a\nhometown media outlet\nnews of the sale before it officially closed.\nThe former Crown Resorts chair snapped up\n630 Nimes Road\nin May to make for a 2025 record in LA County, holding the top spot alone until Spelling Manor traded for the same price a few months later.\nSome of the market\u2019s biggest names had a hand in getting the off-market deal done.\nPacker tapped Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Westside Estate Agency co-founder Kurt Rappaport to represent himself in the deal.\nThe seller, a limited liability company tied to European Investment Management Services Inc. with headquarters in Los Angeles, was represented by Carolwood\u2019s Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, David Parnes and James Harris.\n3. 28719 Grayfox Street, Malibu | PDPG LLC | $80 million\nWho ever heard of a surf shack selling for\n$80 million\n?\nIn Malibu, that\u2019s just another day and another deal\u2013altough it\u2019s notable that the late July closing marked the city\u2019s priciest for 2025.\nThe off-market trade was done quietly and involved two shell companies. On the buy side was PDPG LLC, which records trace to a Longview, Texas address.\nThe seller was a Wyoming LLC, called Surfwatch, managed by Wendy Schreiber Fiske, according to property and state records. The company is tied to a Santa Barbara address that Schreiber Fiske owns with Orlo James Fiske, chief technology officer of electric energy storage tech company Gravity Power.\nCompass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo represented both sides in the trade of the roughly 1,300-square foot home, sitting on a 1.4-acre lot. A second, vacant lot was also part of the deal.\n4. 10905 Chalon Road, Bel-Air | RoadX LLC | $67.5 million\nHidden from wandering eyes, behind privacy hedges running alongside the street, is the contemporary home once owned by Dara Mir.\nMir is the estranged husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lilly Ghalichi, who filed for divorce earlier this year.\nThe businessman quietly sold the property at the end of June to a Delaware-registered limited liability company called RoadX.\nThe hillside property sits on a 1.6-acre lot, with the home spanning roughly 30,000 square feet and includes a sports court and subterranean parking.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Ben Y. Mason and\nJoyce Rey\nwere the listing agents, according to the Multiple Listing Service. The buyer was represented by attorney Nima Stephen Vokshori.\n5. 71 Beverly Park, Beverly Hills Post Office | Paris Hilton and Carter Reum | $63.1 million\nAnother celebrity couple made a move behind the gates of Beverly Park when\nParis Hilton\npaid $63.1 million for a mansion in the upscale community.\nHilton and husband Carter Reum reportedly bought the property from Gu Fang, who is married to Chinese billionaire Xu Hang, whose fortune comes from starting medical device maker Mindray Medical International.\nThe couple didn\u2019t hold the property for very long but appears to have made a tidy return on their investment. They bought it in 2023 for $55 million from actor\nMark Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham\n, who had originally sought\n$87.5 million\nfor the over 30,000-square-foot mansion in 2022.\nHilton tapped family to represent her and Reum in the deal: Barron N. Hilton and his wife Tessa Hilton, who were co-founders and co-CEOs of Hilton Hilton up until their departure from the brokerage to Compass in September.\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass and Alexandra Glass were the listing agents.\n6. 1028 Ridgedale Drive, Beverly Hills | Stancheck Capital LLC | $60 million\nWhat a year for\nJames Packer\n.\nNot only was the billionaire and son of late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer the buyer in a deal tied for No. 1 in Los Angeles County residential for 2025, but he preceded that trade about a month earlier with his sale of 1028 Ridgedale Drive. The April closing marked Beverly Hills\u2019 priciest residential sale of the year.\nThe property was once a rental for Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Before that, comedian couple Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman owned the residence for about two decades before they sold it for $26.6 million in 2015.\nPacker enlisted Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton to represent him in the sale. Rappaport also represented the buyer.\nProperty and state records indicate the buyer is a shell company called Stancheck Capital, with a New York address tied to accounting firm Spritzer Kaufman.\n7. 391 North Carolwood Drive, Holmby Hills | David Zander | $57.3 million\nA 1920\u2019s Spanish Villa quietly made its way onto the market for the first time in more than 20 years before being sold in one of the year\u2019s pricier transactions.\nThe sellers were\nBradley Bell\n, executive producer and head writer for CBS soap \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d and his wife Colleen Bell, property records show. Colleen held several roles for \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d including director of special projects, and was later nominated in 2013 by President Obama to serve as ambassador to Hungary.\nThe couple sold the home in May to TV and film producer David Zander, according to property and state records.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal was the listing agent, while Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton brought the buyer.\n8. 942 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills | 942 Alpine Peak | $51.8 million\nNapa Valley in Beverly Hills. That\u2019s what the late architect Howard Backen was going for with\nVilla Oliva\n, which nabbed a buyer to become one of the city\u2019s more expensive 2025 trades.\nThe over 12,000-square-foot estate counts six beds and seven baths, sitting on nearly an acre.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Linda May held the listing on behalf of a trust tied to Stephen Paul and his wife Nancy Paul. Stephen\u2019s family holds a minority stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers and also founded steel maker Ampco-Pittsburgh.\nThe buyer was a limited liability company called 942 Alpine Peak, which tracks to the NBC Tower at 455 North Cityfront Drive in Chicago, according to property and state records.\nCompass\u2019 Carl Gambino and John Bercsi brought the buyer in what was briefly Beverly Hills\u2019 most expensive trade before 1028 Ridgedale Drive sold later that same month.\n9. 11740 Crescenda Street, Brentwood | Davidson Construction LLC | $44 million\nWhen Milwaukee Brewers minority owner\nRobert Beyer\nsold his Brentwood home, nicknamed Ocho Manos, the purchase price was Brentwood\u2019s highest since a $57 million sale in late 2021 at 13058 Rivers Road.\nBeyer originally\nsought $75 million\nfor the 3.5-acre property and then later reduced the listing price a few times, with the most recent cut in June to $54.9 million.\nThe estate resulted from several parcel transactions and their assemblage\u00a0 before a new home was designed and built over the course of about five years. It was completed in 2005.\nProperty records show the seller was Davidson Construction. A state registration statement ties the company to Westlake Village business Transparent Accounting Solutions Inc. and its owner Evan Ingram.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian brought the buyer. Meanwhile, Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Andrew Beyer, Beyer\u2019s son, were the listing agents.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s priciest home sales in 2025 continue the previous year\u2019s trend\nIn 2024, the priciest home sold set a new record for San Francisco and came with a familiar resident. Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, purchased a Broadway mansion in Pacific Heights for $71 million, more than 50 percent higher than the previous home buy record set in 2021.\nThis year, the highwater mark also sits on Broadway, just about 500 feet west of Jobs\u2019\u00a0 home. There were some departures from the trend, too, as this year\u2019s top deal went for tens of millions of dollars less, and the LLC on the purchasing documents was tied not to one of the Bay Area\u2019s tech titans but a Texas oil magnate.\nMany of the other priciest sales this year also followed 2024\u2019s general trend on the high end, with ultrawealthy homebuyers showing an affinity for the heights \u2014 Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights. Six of the top seven trades happened within 0.2 square miles. And, just as in 2024, a prominent sale along Sea Cliff Avenue helped to break up the high-priced home huddle.\nHere are San Francisco\u2019s most expensive home sales in 2025:\n2930 Broadway \u2013 $42 million\nThis Pacific Heights mansion\nmoved in October for $42 million. The property was sold by the estate of Brooks Walker Jr., a long-time business and civic leader who died last year at 96.\nThe 7,320-square-foot home was built in 1928 by famed San Francisco architect\u00a0 Arthur Brown Jr., who also counts\u00a0 San Francisco City Hall, the War Memorial Opera House and the Veteran Building to his credit.\nThe buyer was listed as HOS Pacific LLC, which is also listed as the owner of a home at 2600 Pacific Ave. The LLC has been tied to Joseph O\u2019Neill, a Texas oil and gas executive, real estate investor, and friend of George W. Bush.\n260 Sea Cliff Avenue \u2013 $30 million\nFrom the time\nthis seaside home sold for $30 million in January\n, this stood as the citywide high-water mark through much of the year, until getting topped by the above sale on Broadway.\nOut of all the high-end home sales in 2025,\u00a0 however, both sides of this transaction featured perhaps the highest profiles, and in its own way told the story of old San Francisco transitioning to new.\nFor four decades, the 8,300-square-foot home was owned by well-known developer Douglas Shorenstein, son of famous real estate executive Walter Shorenstein. Shorenstein bought the three-story mansion for $3 million in the 1980s. For years, actor and comedian Robin Williams lived around the corner.\nThe home was most recently owned by Shorenstein\u2019s daughter and owner of the Curran Theater, Carole Shorenstein Hays.\nSea Cliff House LLC bought the property in January. According to public records, Max Novendstern is listed as the manager of the LLC \u2014 a previously unreported fact. A Max Novendstern is also listed as the head of Worldcoin, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company he co-founded with OpenAI founder Sam Altman.\n2440 Pacific Avenue \u2013 $27.5 million\nThis 12,000-square-foot home saw an off-market sale in May. Built in 1906, the eight-bedroom, six bathroom Pacific Heights mansion was the only Pacific Avenue residence to make the list this year. The home includes a wine cellar, staff bedroom and bathroom, and an original carriage house.\nThe estate was sold by Lindsay Bolton, ex-wife of finance executive George Brown Bolton, who helped with Microsoft\u2019s and Oracle\u2019s IPOs in 1986. The buyer was the Aeonian Trust, which is managed by New York-based tax attorney Johsua Milgram at Dechert LLP.\n2990 Broadway \u2013 $26.5 million\nWhether you call it the Gold Coast or Billionaire\u2019s Row, the grand, historic stretch of mansions in Presidio Heights, Pacific Heights and the Sea Cliff neighborhoods are San Francisco\u2019s most desired. Yet, even on Billionaire\u2019s Row there are levels to the opulence, and this three-level home has long stood out as one of the most coveted.\nWhere many Gold Coast mansions were built in the early 20th century, this 10,100-square-foot home was custom built in 1987 for Bay Area power couple George \u201cFritz\u201d Jewett Jr., the heir to a logging fortune, and his wife, Lucy, a prominent supporter of the arts. Known as the last house on Outer Broadway, the home, designed by architect Sandy Walker, has panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, with the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Marin Headlands all within view.\nThe Jewetts had the house built later in their lives to entertain friends and guests. Names such as Prince Phillip, George H.W. Bush, and Nancy Pelosi have all visited the home.\nThe house was originally listed for $38 million when it went on the market in 2024. In March, CI Investments, a company associated with serial entrepreneur Kevin Rose.\n3701 Washington Street \u2013 $26 million\nBuilt in 1902, this 8,500-square-foot mansion sits two blocks from the Presidio Wall. The property was purchased in 2011 by William Matthes, a former managing partner at New York-based private equity firm Behrman Capital, and his wife, Leigh, an advisory board member for Stanford\u2019s School of Education Challenge Success program. The house, completely remodeled in the early 2000s, notably used as the stage for the San Francisco Decorator Showcase in 2006.\nThe property was purchased by Roxy Bear Trust, which is managed by David Geffon, the former head of games at Youtube.\n2006 Washington Street, Unit #10 \u2013 $24 million\nAmong the collection of single-family mansions, the 5,700-square-foot Pacific Heights property is the only unit in a multifamily building on this year\u2019s list.\nThe penthouse unit on this 11-story building was sold by Christopher Redlich, former CEO of Marine Terminals Company, a shipping and cargo firm. It apparently is also the lone home on the list that was sold at a markdown \u2014 Redlich bought the three-bedroom home for $32 million, and initially listed the unit for $35 million.\nThe unit underwent a major renovation at the hands of renowned architect and interior designer team Andrew Skurman and Suzanne Tucker. Jon Rubenstein, the engineer who helped develop Apple\u2019s iPod and iMac, also lives in the building, and recently listed his unit for $25.5 million.\nIn co-ops, buyers sign a lease to own the exclusive rights to occupy the unit, which creates more opacity around who actually lives in the space. Attorney James Burdette Parker signed the lease. His name has appeared on other\nco-op leases for anonymous buyers.\n2750 Vallejo Street \u2013 $22.5 million\nTroon Pacific renovated and sold this five-story, 7,800-square-foot Pacific Heights home in 2023 for $23.5 million \u2014 one of the top sales of that year.\nThe buyer, 2750 Vallejo Trust, managed by San Francisco wealth manager Tracy Keyser, turned around and sold the property this year for a slight loss. The buyer was Lomax Trust, managed by Lonnie Dorn of San Francisco-based Clear Rock Capital Partners.\nTroon Pacific, the seller in 2023, has made recent headlines. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman bought his Russian Hill mansion from the company in 2020. However, Altman has apparently run into issues with the home, and accused Troon Pacific of selling him a \u201clemon\u201d in a still-open lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "A frenzy of multifamily sales in Chicago boosted the commercial real estate market in the second half of the year.\nMultifamily sales made up eight out of the 10 priciest sales in Cook County this year, data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nshows. All but one of those multifamily sales took place in the third or fourth quarter of the year.\nStill, two industrial properties traded in high-profile deals, including the priciest commercial sale of 2025.\nThe highest dollar transaction in Cook County this year was High Street Logistics\u2019 sale of a $270 million industrial portfolio in the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\nTRD\nfound. It was the only sale that came in over $200 million.\nIn 2024, by comparison, Cook County\u2019s top three sales all\ncame in well over $200 million\n, with\nthe $504 million sale of the Sheraton Grand Riverwalk\nhotel topping the list.\nDespite lackluster sales on the priciest end of the market, Cook County still recorded a solid flow of deals between the $100 million and $200 million range. Multifamily deals dominated the market, as the region\nexperienced rent growth that outpaced most of the U.S\n.\nMuch of that is due to a historically low supply of new multifamily developments hitting the market. Construction has been slowed by high interest rates and construction costs coupled with\nrestrictive city policies\nand\na challenging property tax environment\nin Cook County.\nWhile developers may be struggling to get new projects started in Chicago, the limited supply of new properties started to draw investors during the second half of the year.\nContinuing that momentum, already an early contender exists for top commercial sale of the year for 2026. Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, announced Dec. 15 that\nthe firm is selling its portfolio of seven rental complexes\nacross the Chicago area for $455 million.\nThe sale to LaTerra Capital, based in Marina Del Ray, California, and Respark Residential, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is set to close in the first quarter of 2026. It is part of Denver-based Aimco\u2019s\nbroader plans to liquidate\nand wind down operations.\nHere are the top commercial deals of 2025, based on\nTRD\nresearch:\nHigh Street Elgin industrial portfolio | $270 million\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s $270 million investment in Elgin in June nabbed the top spot for the priciest commercial sale of the year and was one of the most expensive industrial real estate purchases in the Chicago area in recent memory.\nThe Kansas City-based firm\nbought a portfolio of about a dozen warehouses\nspanning 2.8 million square feet in the northwest Chicago suburb, paying about $96 per square foot, public records show. Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics cashed in on an upswing in the region\u2019s industrial market with the sale.\nNorthPoint, founded by former Trammell Crow executive Robert Chagares 23 years ago, bought the portfolio for about $230 million in 2021.\nNorth Water Apartments | $175 million\nAmid a Chicagoland buying spree, FPA Multifamily purchased\nthe North Water Apartments\nfor $175 million in December.\nTrinity Property Consultants, a firm with ties to Greg Fowler\u2019s FPA Multifamily, bought the 398-unit apartment building at 340 East North Water Street from Miami-based developer Crescent Heights. The deal includes only the multifamily portion of the building \u2014 a 400-room Loews hotel occupies the rest of the building.\nCrescent Heights secured a $112 million Freddie Mac loan on the building in 2023 at an interest rate of 5.5 percent, maturing in July 2028, and it was assumable by a buyer. That was likely a selling point for FPA, offering relief from higher interest rates in today\u2019s market.\nWhen the building hit the market earlier in the year, the property was listed as 93 percent occupied, with average rents of $3,574 per unit. Newmark brokers Liz Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson represented Crescent Heights on the listing.\nFor FPA, the North Water Apartments acquisition was the latest in a flurry of activity for the firm across the Chicago area.\nThe San Francisco-based company bought a Naperville apartment complex in March for $68 million, a month after it sold\na Downers Grove building to Laramar Group\n. FPA also\npurchased a 500-unit South Loop building\nin March 2024 for $144 million, following that with\na $60 million Oak Park tower\nin July 2024, and\nanother Oak Park acquisition\nin August of that year.\nFulbrix Apartments | $170 million\nMoceri &amp; Roszak sold a Fulton Market apartment development for $170 million in April, snagging a win after the firm\u2019s struggle in the office sector.\nA venture of New York-based Normandy Real Estate\nacquired the 27-story, 375-unit Fulbrix Apartments at 160 North Elizabeth Stree\nt from developer Moceri &amp; Roszak and equity partner Ares Management. The price equated to $453,000 per unit.\nEastdil Secured brokers Bryan Rosenberg and Donald Kelly represented the sellers. The buyers scored a $120 million Fannie Mae loan originated by Greystone\u2019s Eric Rosenstock and Jesse Yodice. It\u2019s a 10-year loan term with seven years of interest-only payments.\nMoceri &amp; Roszak completed the building in 2023. The buyer, Normandy Real Estate, is reportedly connected to the group that purchased McDonald\u2019s global headquarters in Fulton Market in 2020, which was a high-profile vote of confidence in the corridor\u2019s long-term potential.\nLeft Bank at K Station | $151 million\nHouston-based Hines added to its growing Chicago multifamily portfolio by buying\nthe Left Bank at K Station\napartment tower for $151 million in November.\nA venture of New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate sold the 37-story, 451-unit building at 300 North Canal Street in West Loop to a Hines-affiliated fund, according to Cook County property records. The sale amounted to $335,000 per unit.\nThe deal was brokered by JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman.\nPGIM put the tower on the market in June, one of several downtown multifamily listings this year, as strong rent growth and minimal new supply enticed investors back into the market.\nCompleted in 2006 by PGIM and Chicago-based Fifield Companies, Left Bank sits near the confluence of the Chicago River and marks one of the earliest residential components of Fifield\u2019s master-planned K Station community, which also includes the K2, Echelon and Alta towers. PGIM later bought out Fifield\u2019s stake in 2007.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials touted an opportunity for upgrades, noting that about 17 percent of units have yet to be modernized \u2014 a potential value-add play for Hines, which has been expanding its residential portfolio nationally.\nRents at Left Bank ranged from $2,432 for studios to $4,162 for two-bedrooms when the property hit the market.\nFifteen 98 | $136 million\nAmid a busy year for suburban sales, a New Jersey-based firm joined in on the action in August.\nThe Solomon Organization\nbought the 640-unit Fifteen 98 Naperville,\nat 1598 Fairway Drive, from San Francisco-based FPA Multifamily, DuPage County property records show.\nThe $136 million sale price equated to $212,500 per unit.\nFPA had paid $98.5 million for the 34-acre property in 2017.\nSolomon, based in Summit, New Jersey, controls about 21,000 units across nine states.\nThe firm financed the Naperville buy with a $91 million loan from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. The property built in 1984\u00a0 \u2014 formerly known as the Addison of Naperville \u2014 includes 39 low-rise buildings with a 6.6 percent vacancy rate. Asking rents average $1,879 a month, or $2.11 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nMilieu | $134 million\nAmli Residential made a purchase in December to make the list of top commercial transactions of 2025.\nThe Chicago-based\nfirm paid more than $134 million for Milieu\n, a 19-story, 275-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street in the West Loop.\nSeller Pacific Life Insurance developed the tower and completed it in 2019. The company partnered with White Oak Realty Partners and Crayton Advisors on the project. Pacific Life later bought out its partners and financed the property with an $86 million loan in 2021, Cook County records show.\nMilieu includes 215 parking spaces, a rooftop pool and deck and a full slate of amenities. When JLL brought the property to market in July, occupancy stood at 96 percent, with new leases signed at 5 percent rent increases, year-to-date, according to marketing materials.\nThe building is in the West Loop neighborhood which has become one of the city\u2019s most competitive submarkets. Interest in the area is driven by recent office conversions, an uptick in the dining scene and its proximity to Fulton Market.\nOne East Delaware | $130 million\nA California investor scooped up one of the Gold Coast\u2019s marquee apartment towers, closing a nine-figure deal that underscored the strength of Chicago\u2019s rental market and the painful price resets that are still rippling through the city\u2019s investment landscape.\nSan Francisco-based\nFriedkin Property Group paid $130 million for the 26-story, 304-unit One East Delaware\nin November, according to Cook County records. It marks one of downtown\u2019s priciest multifamily trades of the year, yet still a steep markdown from the sellers.\nThe building at 1 East Delaware Place was sold by a venture of Golub &amp; Co. and Alcion Ventures, which bought it for $146 million in 2016 and later poured another $30 million into renovations. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman brokered the deal.\nThe building also offers 37,000-square-feet of retail space that is 87 percent leased.\nThe Golub-Alcion venture refinanced the property in late 2021 with a $113.5 million loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2024. Whether the lenders provided an extension was unclear, but the clock was ticking.\nBuffalo Grove, Elgin and Vernon Hills industrial portfolio | $102 million\nSilverman Group began the year by doubling the size of its Chicagoland commercial property portfolio.\nIn January, the New Jersey-based real estate investment\nfirm spent about $102 million on a 925,000-square-foot collection of low-rise buildings\naimed at light industrial and office tenants in the northern and northwest suburbs of Chicago, public records show. The price was about $110 per square foot.\nThe seller was San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group, which has offloaded a series of Chicago-area industrial, multifamily and office investments in recent years. Stockbridge paid $63.4 million ($69 per square foot) to buy the buildings in 2019, property records show.\nThe properties are in Buffalo Grove, Vernon Hills and Elgin and include 17 buildings that were 92 percent leased at the time of sale. The deal brings Silverman\u2019s Chicago-area portfolio to just under 2 million square feet, according to a news release.\nMike Tenteris, Adam Tyler and Jim Carpenter with Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Stockbridge in its sale to Silverman.\nAlgonquin Commons | $100 million\nA suburban turnaround led by a California-based retail redevelopment specialist paid off for the seller.\nRed Mountain Group and investment partner F&amp;F Capital sold the Algonquin Commons shopping center\nto Nuveen for $100 million\nin September, four years after buying the site for $33 million. The prior owners, Inland Real Estate, gave it up via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut Nuveen didn\u2019t necessarily overpay either. Inland bought the property for $154 million in 2006 before the Great Recession led to several store closings and ultimately Inland\u2019s default.\nThe Red Mountain joint venture spent the last few years on a $30 million plan to bring the once struggling shopping center back to life.\nThe California-based company quickly attracted new tenants, including The Fresh Market, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and a Twin Peaks restaurant. Over the past four years, the shopping center has gone from 60 percent to 94 percent occupied, according to Red Mountain. The firm put the property on the market late last year.\nNewmark\u2019s Bill Bauman, Kyle Miller, Keely Polczynski and Conor Lalor represented Red Mountain and F&amp;F in the sale.\nThe Mil\u2019Ton | $100 million\nA longtime Chicago investor eyed opportunities in the suburbs this year.\nTLC Management purchased a Vernon Hills apartment complex for $100 million in August.\nInvestor Stuart Handler\u2019s Chicago-based company\nacquired The Mil\u2019Ton,\na 294-unit, three-building property at 1155 Museum Boulevard, from financial services firm Mesirow, according to property records. The price amounted to $340,100 per unit.\nMesirow bought the complex in 2018 for $87.1 million and listed it in March with CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck, Jillian Jaeger and Tricia Carolan.\nThe firm rebranded the property as The Majestic Luxury Apartments after a round of amenity renovations that included the clubhouse, gym, coworking areas, yoga space and pool. The seven-story complex, built in 2004, is 94 percent occupied with asking rents averaging nearly $3,000 a month.\nMesirow is doubling down on multifamily. The firm announced in May it had raised $1.25 billion for a new national apartment fund, a 66 percent increase, with plans to target top-tier markets across the U.S.",
