        "content": "Two years after falling into bankruptcy and closing all of its stores across the United States, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is poised for a retail comeback \u2014 just not in California.\nMarcus Lemonis, executive chairman and principal executive officer of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond parent company Beyond Incorporated, handed down the decree, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. California won\u2019t get any Bed Bath &amp; Beyond storefronts as the company prepares to relaunch some brick-and-mortar operations.\n\u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about reality,\u201d Lemonis said. \u201cCalifornia has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses in America. It\u2019s a system that makes it harder to employ people, harder to keep doors open, and harder to deliver value to customers.\u201d\nCompanies that operate in the Golden State face \u201chigher taxes, higher fees, higher wages that many businesses simply cannot sustain, and endless regulations that strangle growth,\u201d he said.\n\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond filed for\nbankruptcy\nin 2023 and closed all 360 of its stores from coast to coast. In early 2022, a year before the troubled retailer filed for bankruptcy, there were 87 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations in California, per Statista.\nThe company is in the midst of a rebirth as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home. The first location opened in Nashville earlier this month. About 75 former Kirkland\u2019s Home locations across the country are expected to turn into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home stores by next year.\nCustomers in California will still have access to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s inventory via the company\u2019s website. In response to Lemonis\u2019 statement, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office brushed off the executive\u2019s rebuff of the state.\n\u201cAfter their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath &amp; Beyond no longer existed,\u201d the governor\u2019s office wrote on social media. \u201cWe wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again as they try to open a second store.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An East Austin landfill that closed decades ago has become the unlikely roadblock to one of the city\u2019s most ambitious mixed-use projects.\nGraham Development is suing Travis County after officials denied its plan to relocate an auto scrapyard to a 42-acre site at 9500 East U.S. Highway 290 \u2014 a former landfill that stopped accepting waste in 1982 but allegedly still leaks toxins into nearby soil and water, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Austin-based firm needs the scrapyard, LKQ Auto Salvage, off its South Congress Avenue property in order to move forward with a planned 43-acre project that would deliver more than 1,200 apartments, 210,000 square feet of offices, and 136,000 square feet of retail. The development would be positioned next to where Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority is building a new\nOrange Line\nrail route.\nThe problem: LKQ\u2019s lease at 7900\nSouth Congress Avenue\nruns until 2036. Without relocating it, Graham\u2019s transit-oriented project is stuck in limbo. The developer and the landfill\u2019s owner, Moo Moo Meadows, filed a lawsuit July 31 in federal court, arguing the county exceeded its authority when it blocked the scrapyard relocation and claiming the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \u2014 not the county \u2014 should decide land use questions for closed landfills.\n\nThe suit also accused Travis County of decades of neglect, saying the landfill has been leaking hazardous leachate into the ground since the 1960s and still tests positive for unsafe levels of arsenic, barium and lead. Graham alleges the county is using the contamination as a \u201cbludgeon\u201d to stifle development.\nCounty officials pushed back, pointing to ongoing cooperation with TCEQ and past efforts to address the landfill. Travis County commissioners voted unanimously in August 2023 to deny the scrapyard move, citing risks to human health and environmental safety.\nThe stakes go beyond legal wrangling. The South Congress project could reshape a corridor already under heavy development pressure, bringing both density and affordable housing to a rapidly growing part of the city. But until the scrapyard has left the vision on ice.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New Yorkers retreat to the Hudson Valley to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.\nThey find refuge in the quieter expanses in a two-hour range of Manhattan, where drool-worthy properties aren\u2019t glitzy high-rise condos, but quaint farmhouses, Victorian mansions and sprawling estates. Historically, the firms trading those properties were boutique mainstays that embrace the pace of small(er) town life.\nEnter Serhant.\nThe five-year-old brokerage\nset up shop\nin the region in October with a 10-person team poached from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices\u2019 Hudson Valley franchise.\nThe then-four-year-old brokerage was relatively early\namong its New York City-born competitors\nin establishing a Hudson Valley presence. Corcoran launched Corcoran Country Living in 2020 and Compass earlier this year added the 14-agent Upstate Untapped Team.\nThe interest from brokerages has followed a rising tide in the Hudson Valley market. Home prices hit record highs last year, just as Serhant opened its doors, with the median sale price in every county in the region beating $300,000, the Times Union reported earlier this year.\nAlmost a year into the Garay-Michaud Team\u2019s tenure at the brokerage and it appears the team has embraced the firm\u2019s signature social media- and content-friendly stunts to sell homes.\nThis week, broker Jordan Vaccaro hosted roughly 60 brokers at a mountaintop estate in East Fishkill for a sunset soiree, complete with a DJ and private chef. An unusual addition to the broker open house \u2014 off-road ATV tours of the 120-acre property, on the market for just under $4 million. (Vaccaro had initially planned for a helicopter to sail over 401 Woodmount Road, known as the Cloud Walk Estate, but wind conditions kept the party grounded.)\nCruising between the estate\u2019s two homes, barn and three-car garage meant a trove of Instagram-worthy shots, and while taking an ATV around the streets of Manhattan likely won\u2019t happen any time soon, the footage posted on social media rivals the drone shots of Billionaires\u2019 Row towers that Serhant is famous for.\n\u201cJaws\u201d in the Hamptons\nA luxury residential broker who\u2019s a fixture in Manhattan\u2019s social scene said she was caught in a beachfront fray in East Hampton this week. Gail Bomze, a 75-year-old Compass agent who has brought eight-figure listings to the market, was accused of biting a seven-year-old in a dust-up at a community concert.\nAn\narrest report seen by Page Six\ndescribed an account from an event worker that a woman was seen \u201ckicking and punching kids\u201d to get hold of a t-shirt thrown as a giveaway at a beach concert in East Hampton last week. In the frenzy, a child told police, a woman \u201cgrabbed her right arm and bit,\u201d drawing blood.\nBomze, who was arrested Tuesday and charged with third-degree assault and endangering a child, has denied the allegations. In a statement to the outlet, her attorney said Bomze was instead \u201cknocked to the ground\u201d in the chaos of the t-shirt toss and reported the incident to organizers, who returned with an apology for the fray.\n\nNot so fast\u2026\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is back in the news this week after two of the New York City leader\u2019s associates\nwere indicted\non Thursday.\nProsecutors accused the mayor\u2019s former aide, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, of accepting bribes and other perks from real estate developers in exchange for helping them secure city contracts and expediting their projects.\nJesse Hamilton\n, who oversaw the city\u2019s office leasing portfolio, allegedly conspired with Lewis-Martin and heeded her directives to give certain developers preference.\nThe developers identified in the indictments are Tian Ji Li and Yechiel Landau. One of the indictments also alleges Lewis-Martin conspired with Anthony and Gina Argento, the owners of a production studio, to ditch the protected bike lanes included in the redevelopment plans for McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nLewis-Martin \u2014 who was already facing charges in a December indictment \u2014 allegedly accepted $75,000 worth of bribes over two years, including a speaking role in the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem.\u201d\nHamilton resigned from his post at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, or DCAS, on Thursday following news of the indictment. Lewis-Martin resigned from the administration last year.\nAdams was previously facing federal charges of fraud and bribery, among others, though a federal judge dropped the case in April.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in public records this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s One57, which traded at a loss. Unit 51C at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower sold for just under $15 million, or $4,300 per square foot \u2014 down from its 2015 purchase price of $19 million.\nThe discount is in line with other\nresales at the building\n, which has seen units trade for roughly 24 percent less than their sponsor sale price.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment has drifted on and off the market since 2018, when it was listed for $22 million, and last asked $18 million.\nBespoke had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Remember when real estate executives were dropping Andrew Cuomo and backing Eric Adams\u2019 re-election bid?\nThat now seems like\nages ago\n, and I\u2019m hearing from some in the industry that we shouldn\u2019t expect the level of spending that we saw in the lead up to the primary \u2014 on either candidate. One source noted that industry insiders were shocked by Cuomo\u2019s loss in the primary and responded by throwing their support behind Adams. Some may now step back, the source said.\nThis week, I asked readers of this newsletter \u2014\u00a0specifically those who had decided after the primary to back Adams \u2014 if they had changed their mind given the mayor\u2019s place in the polls and the additional corruption\nallegations\nagainst those in his inner circle.\nI heard from two people who firmly feel the mayor\u2019s fate in the election shouldn\u2019t be swayed by the accusations against his former top aide and his former real estate chief. Nor the\npotato chip incident\nwith former aide Winnie Greco. They also remained supportive of the mayor, even after he was personally indicted (charges that were dismissed this year).\n\u201cI am sticking with re-electing Mayor Adams because I think he did a pretty good job considering that he had so little support from the City Council and had an impossible job fixing all the mistakes made by [Bill] de Blasio\u2019s disastrous mayoralty,\u201d attorney Stuart Saft said in an email.\nFor his part, the mayor was defiant at a press conference on Friday, noting that some reporters had asked his staff if he was going to announce his exit from the race. He said he couldn\u2019t leave the city to the other candidates in the race.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to go backwards,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d\nOthers in the industry appear to be watching and waiting. For example, RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler, who indicated last month he was open to supporting Adams, has not formally decided who to support, per a rep. He previously donated $250,000 to Fix the City, a super PAC tied to Cuomo.\nToday was the deadline for mayoral campaigns to report their donation hauls between July 12 and August 18. As of early Friday evening, the filings for most of the campaigns were not on the Campaign Finance Board\u2019s website.\nI was able to start sorting through Mamdani\u2019s filings. He reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. The filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors (including those who identified as working in real estate, development, brokerage, property management, construction and architecture). That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nI\u2019m expecting to see donations pop up from fundraisers held for Adams last month (the results of an SL Green fundraiser didn\u2019t seem to be in the last set of filings). The race is fluid, and the donations made in July already seem somewhat stale, perhaps not reflective of where the industry stands today in the race.\n\nOf course, that won\u2019t stop us from writing about which real estate executive donated to each of the campaigns, so keep an eye out for that.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMore mayoral candidates should want to sit down and talk to nerds. Specifically, this nerd here \u2014 me. With this in mind, I ask you: Will Zohran Mamdani\u2019s press people ever respond to me? Send help to kathryn@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In 2010, Houston, Texas,\nbanned\na number of attention-getting items that are typical outside car dealerships \u2014\u00a0think giant inflatable gorilla strapped to a roof or those brightly colored \u201ctube men\u201d that thrash in the wind. The changes were made over traffic safety concerns,\nper Next City\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0The family of Julia Hyman, the 27-year-old Rudin associate killed in the Midtown mass shooting last month, has hired a lawyer to investigate her death, according to the\nNew York Post\n. A source told the paper the elevators should have been shut down as soon as the shooter entered with a semi-automatic rifle, which might have prevented him from getting past the lobby. The family is also looking into whether Rudin provided adequate security given the building\u2019s high-profile tenants.\n\u2014\u00a0The city issued a permit to self-driving taxi company Waymo for a pilot program,\nGothamist\nreports. The permit allows the company to test eight self-driving cars on city streets, provided a driver is present and no passengers are on board. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$13.3 million\nfor a condominium unit at 443 Greenwich Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,000 square feet and last sold on the market for $8 million in 2018.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$28.9 million\nat 229 West 43rd Street. The New York Times building retail space formerly owned by the Kushner family sold at a steep discount of $114 per square foot.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10.5 million for a condo unit at 127 East 64th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is 4,000 square feet and is listed by\nCompass\u2019\nTrade Residential Team.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "It\u2019s time to start using the B-word in L.A. That is, it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market.\nAfter months of hemming and hawing and getting mixed answers depending on if someone is speaking on or off the record, those who have no problem telling it like it is are coming around to what this is \u2014 with some market-specific caveats.\nThe shift was perhaps tiptoed into sometime in the first quarter. That\u2019s when Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, who compiles the group\u2019s weekly signed contracts report, suggested the possibility of a buyer\u2019s market \u201cin the near future.\u201d That\u2019s when the brokerage\u2019s data pointed to weekly growth of luxury listings, without comparable signed contracts to offset the inventory ramp. In the case of the week ended March 15, there were 23 homes that went into contract, while 97 listings were added.\nThe most recent Eklund Gomes report for the week ended Aug. 17 had 20 signed contracts, while 76 homes were added to the market.\n\u201cThe word I would use is challenging because the market is shifting, but not completely,\u201d said Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California COO Nina Zokhrabyan. \u201cYes, it is a buyer\u2019s market, but interest rates are high.\u201d\nThe part of the cycle L.A. real estate finds itself in is at a \u201cweird moment\u201d in time, she said.\nIn some cases, sellers still think their properties are worth what they originally asked, and buyers are seeing through the glossy photos and marketing speak.\nMuch like how the industry talked up good agenting following last year\u2019s NAR settlement over an antitrust lawsuit on commissions, this is where skill matters, some say.\n\u201cThe sellers and the buyers are now trying to figure out that price, that happy medium, and this is where the agents come in,\u201d Zokhrabyan said. \u201cIf you have really good agents on both ends, they\u2019ll be able to navigate and negotiate on the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s behalf to make the deal.\u201d\nULA throws off \u201cnormal\u201d cycle\nThere\u2019s more on Zokhrabyan\u2019s point about the market oddities.\nThat\u2019s so for a couple of reasons that are not cyclical. First off, there\u2019s the\nMeasure United to House LA\nfactor that has impacted the $5 million and above market.\nThe tiered tax for properties only in the city of Los Angeles kicks in with deals of $5.3 million getting assessed a 4 percent levy and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more. The thresholds are adjusted annually by the city.\nThe \u201cmansion tax\u201d has been a wet blanket for deals since the November 2022 ballot measure went into effect in April 2023.\nThe Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana has a client, David Maman of David Maman Design, who in March sold 1050 Stradella Road in Bel-Air for $25 million and had to pay $2 million for\nULA\n. The end result was no profit on the sale.\nThe developer bought the property in 2018 for $4.8 million, built it anew into a seven-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion and listed it in March 2024 for $33.8 million.\n\u201cULA, the fires, the economy\u2014all that has created uncertainty in the L.A. market,\u201d Arana said.\nThe fires factor\nThe question of insurance bubbles up to the surface when looking at post-fire recovery and dealmaking.\nAltadena, Pasadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu are all coming back from January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires. The blazes razed whole neighborhoods and communities, but it also added to jitters around the state\u2019s existing insurance crisis.\nInsurance\n, which one needs for a mortgage, is hard to come by or quite pricey.\n\u201cInsurance has quietly become one of the biggest deal killers in California real estate,\u201d said\u00a0 Parker Beatty, Compass regional vice president of Southern California and Hawaii.\u00a0 \u201cPost-fires, it\u2019s now one of the first questions a buyer asks, and the rising cost of ownership can spook people. With traditional insurance pulling back, many homeowners are being pushed into the state\u2019s\nFAIR Plan\n. Enrollments nearly doubled this year, highlighting both the depth of the problem and the scramble for solutions.\u201d\n\nThose in real estate can usually find the bright side, and Parker said there are opportunities to be had in the challenges: \u201cThose willing to navigate it are finding openings that others overlook,\u201d he said.\nMowbrays\u2019 $65M Moves in Malibu\nBrothers\nNick and Mat Mowbray\nfound success in toys, but recent real estate acquisitions in Malibu could place them at the forefront of the city\u2019s fire rebuilding process.\nThe Mowbrays are behind the mysterious buys of nine plots of land on Malibu\u2019s La Costa and Carbon beaches after the fires, spending $65 million on the real estate. The transactions were first reported by\nRealtor.com\n, and\nKevin Shelburn\nof Mar Vista-based Shelburn Realty Group sleuthed out the buyers\u2019 identity.\nIt\u2019s what the Mowbrays plan to do with the land that\u2019s now most interesting. The company did not return requests for comment on the purchases this past week, but one wonders if the oceanfront lots will be case studies for the Mowbrays\u2019 Zuru Tech pre-fabricated housing subsidiary. That\u2019s the software platform that promises the ability to design a custom home or commercial property online, with the components built in a factory and then delivered to the site.\nLast year, Nick Mowbray told\nBloomberg\nthe business is expected to \u201cdwarf everything we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nPerhaps Malibu will have a front-row seat to that.\nWhat buyer\u2019s market? $110M listing hits Santa Monica\nBranden and Rayni Williams are testing the theory of the ultra-wealthy bubble that can skirt broader market trends.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates co-founders placed a\n$110 million listing\non the market that is Santa Monica\u2019s priciest home for sale and one of eight in Los Angeles County in the nine-figure club.\nFor as much as agents talk up \u201cunique\u201d properties selling, 859 Woodacres Road really fits that profile. The 12,000-square-foot residence, asking $9,167 per square foot, sits at the Riviera Country Club\u2019s 7th hole and was designed by the late Howard Backen. The architect was known for his residential and winery work.\nThe asking price is about a 168 percent jump from the last known trade, which occurred off market in 2017. That\u2019s when the property sold for $41.1 million. At the time, the closing was Santa Monica\u2019s priciest-ever deal.\nChunk of OC history up for sale\nOrange County history buffs will appreciate this one.\nCompass\u2019 Annie Clougherty and Mike Johnson brought\n245 Crescent Bay Drive\nonto the market with an ask of just under $20 million. The estate of James and Martha Newkirk, the couple who bought the property in 1979, is selling the Laguna Beach home. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom property spans about 6,900 square feet and looks out onto the Pacific Ocean.\nThe home\u2019s only traded hands a few times since the 19th century.\nThat starts with the 1905 sale of what was once part of Irvine ranch to the McKnight family from the Irvine family. Irvine Ranch was made up of Spanish and Mexican land grants from 1864 and is the predecessor to the Irvine Company.\nThe McKnight family\u2019s L.C. McKnight was among a group of individuals who are credited with developing Laguna Cliffs, the first neighborhood in Laguna Beach.\nIn the 1920s, planes flown by Florence Lowe \u201cPancho\u201d Barnes passed by and landed close to the Crescent Bay Drive property. Barnes started the first stunt pilots union and broke Amelia Earhart\u2019s air speed record in 1930.\nNow, Chateau du Soleil\u2019s big claim is that it sits across from Los Angeles Times\u2019 billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s blufftop estate, which he bought for $45 million in 2016.\n",

        "content": "A development site in the West Loop that\u2019s zoned for up to 362 multifamily units is hitting the market during a historic supply drought.\nBut it\u2019s not just available space that developers are looking for. It\u2019s lower interest rates, lower construction costs, willing lenders and a more predictable property tax environment.\nIf the West Loop site sells, it will be because the appeal of the property has overcome all the other headwinds developers are facing in the city.\nLocated at 309 South Green Street, the listing consists of a parking lot and an industrial, loft-style office. With access to Fulton Market directly north and the Loop directly east, the site could benefit from demand for housing from young professionals. It is being marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Susan Tjanksen and Anna Lovell; the seller hasn\u2019t been identified.\nFewer than 300 units are slated for delivery this year, a historically low figure for the market, Integra Realty Resources found. It\u2019s been difficult to get apartment projects off the ground, but those that do get started will benefit from the city\u2019s strong rent growth.\n\nDowntown Chicago\u2019s luxury apartment rents rose 2.56 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching $3.60 per square foot, Integra found. Rents in general are expected to grow 4 percent this year.\nJust north of the listing, Fulton Market is seeing some of the only major multifamily developments taking off.\nIn May, Cedar Street scored a discount on a Fulton Market property, setting the stage for a 300-unit apartment project. The Chicago-based firm paid $6.5 million for the former Leslie Hindman Auctioneers property at 1332 and 1338 West Lake Street.\nThe two connected buildings span roughly 36,000 square feet on just over half an acre at the northeast corner of Lake and Ada streets. Hindman listed it for sale in mid-2020 with an $11 million asking price.\nAn asking price isn\u2019t included in the 309 South Green listing but it will likely sell for a significant markup. The property has been held in a trust since the 1990s when it sold for just $375,000.",

That led to a lawsuit from\nlenders\nincluding JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank over unpaid debt.\nAt one point, San Francisco Centre was one of the best-performing malls on the West Coast, but it\u2019s largely become a ghost town. The shopping center is between 30 percent and 40 percent occupied, according to the\nSan Francisco Examiner\n, representing a steep drop from 96 percent in 2016. By that estimate, between 750,000 and 1 million square feet is vacant at the 1.5 million-square-foot mall.\nThe mall\u2019s court-appointed receiver Trident Pacific and real estate broker JLL are not involved in the auction process.\n\nRetailers and restaurants have been running for the doors over the past two years.\nIn 2023, Nordstrom\nclosed\nits flagship at the mall as part of its citywide exodus. It was followed by another anchor department store,\nBloomingdale\u2019s\n, earlier this year. Several other retailers have exited in recent months, including\nZara\n, Steve Madden, Kate Spade, Sunglass Hut, Oak + Fort and Razer electronics.\nIt\u2019s gotten harder to find a bite to eat at the barren shopping center. Restaurants and food court outposts have closed up shop, with the latest departees including Jamba Juice, Blondie\u2019s Pizza, Izzy &amp; Wooks sandwich shop, Mija Cochinita taco shop, Mai Savory Hot Dogs and a Fires of Brazil barbecue restaurant.\nFoot traffic has dropped off significantly as the mall empties out. Visitors to San Francisco Centre fell 63.3 percent between 2019 and 2024, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. It was just as bad from January to May of this year with foot traffic down 68 percent from the same period in 2019 and between 25 and 40 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Wood will also manage leasing alongside Noah Dodge and Ben Wallace. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.\nMcKinney Air Business Park will consist of two buildings spanning 250,000 square feet.

It\u2019s supposed to be completed by 2031. The city said the project could accommodate up to 1 million passengers annually, providing an alternative to Dallas Fort Worth International and Love Field.\nThe airport expansion has inspired other industrial developments, too.\nHolley Development Company\nrecently collected 461 acres nearby for an industrial development.\n\nMcKinney Air Business Park will enjoy easy access to the future Spur 399, an eight-lane freeway currently under construction that would connect U.S. 75 with U.S. 380.\nThe airport expansion project and construction of Spur 399 come as Collin County, home to McKinney, is growing residents by the bushel: the county added around 46,700 residents between July 2023 and July 2024, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\nCaprock specializes in acquiring and developing industrial real estate in Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington.

        "content": "Carolwood\u2019s\ndeal\nto purchase EY Plaza for $130 million fell through. The office tower is coming back to market, a source familiar told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nServicer commentary indicated it was \u201cunable to negotiate acceptable documentation with the selected buyer,\u201d according to Morningstar. A month earlier, the special servicer said a buyer was selected, approvals were obtained, documentation had commenced and a closing was expected soon.\nThe sale to the Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld-led firm still would have been less than the $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the 41-story office building that was placed in receivership two years ago after Brookfield missed payments \u2014 and less than the 900,000-square-foot office property\u2019s latest value: $150 million. The office tower was once valued at $446 million four years ago.\nTo receive, or not to receive\nThe Rising Realty Partners-owned One California Plaza could be placed in\nreceivership\nafter defaulting on $300 million of CMBS debt, if the court agrees to the lender\u2019s request.\nOn behalf of the loan holders and through a special servicer, US Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the foreclosed, 1-million-square-foot office tower downtown and collect rents, according to a complaint filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The complaint notes that the plaintiff believes the borrower intends to consent to the appointment of a receiver.\nChristopher Rising\u2019s company and Colony Capital purchased the office tower at 300 South Grand Avenue for $465 million eight years ago. But the 42-story, Bunker Hill office property is now worth less than the debt connected to it and less than its purchase price. A recent appraisal put its value at about $121 million, compared to $459 million at loan issuance in 2017.\nPost-pandemic occupancy is down at the property to about 63 percent this year compared to 88 percent at underwriting.\n\u201cBorrower is in default under the loan documents and is depriving plaintiff of its interest in the rents, causing material, immediate and irreparable damage to plaintiff,\u201d the complaint reads. It later notes: \u201cunless a receiver is appointed, plaintiff will suffer great and irreparable damage.\u201d\nValue haircut\nRealty Bancorp\u2019s Los Angeles County office portfolio ran into some more\ntrouble\n. After the roughly $67 million in CMBS debt connected to the five-property portfolio landed in special servicing, the borrower became delinquent, with the offices worth less than half as much as it was at underwriting six years ago.\nThe 346,800-square-foot portfolio, located throughout Aguora Hills, Woodland Hills and Calabasas, was recently appraised at $47.8 million compared to $101.6 million in 2019.\nOne of the Aguora Hills properties was home to the Los Angeles Rams for nine years, but the team\u2019s billionaire owner, Stan Kroenke, moved the headquarters, part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center in Woodland Hills. Total occupancy declined to 72 percent at the end of June from 98 percent at underwriting six years ago \u2014 and the office buildings are not bringing in enough money to pay off the debt.\nThe latest servicer commentary notes that the borrower is requesting a short term forbearance, or a temporary suspension of loan payments for a set period, which the special servicer is reviewing.\n\nHundreds of million in bonds\nOne Beverly Hills could receive up to $550 million in bond\nfinancing\n, after the Beverly Hills City Council gave developers Cain International and OKO Group the greenlight to allot a Community Facilities District.\nThat means of the $550 million special taxes, $390 million would be used to fund public improvements and $160 million would be allocated for \u201cfuture city council to fund major repairs or enhancements to the public improvements decade from now without needing to revisit voter approvals,\u201d according to a presentation at the council meeting.\nThe 17.5-acre mixed-use development is set to include an Aman resort, two condominium towers and the renovation of Beverly Hilton hotel. Development is underway after the city council approved the plan in 2021, and the project is anticipated to be completed three years from now. Revenues would then be used to repay the bonds.\n\u201cThe CFDs really act like takeout financing,\u201d Cain\u2019s managing director said at the council meeting. \u201cIt is not a gift or a subsidy. There is no financial risk to the city, and there is no impact to the existing taxpayers outside of the CFD.\u201d\nMega-project moves\nMore development news out of the opulent Beverly Hills: the city planning commission\nvoted\nin favor of Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Saks Global\u2019s 3.7 acre mixed-use development. The approval came despite criticism during the public hearing, and with some amendments to logistics such as an area for pedestrians to walk and retail and restaurant space.\n\u201cAt the last meeting, there were questions about the retail and restaurant distribution. To clarify this issue and move the project forward, we\u2019re prepared to accept a limit of 15,088 square feet of restaurant use, as shown on the concept plan, exclusive of the hotel and private club,\u201d Douglas Adams, senior vice president of Saks\u2019 real estate development arm, said during the August meeting.\nThe plan calls for 76 apartments, a boutique hotel, a spa, a social club, 45,000 square feet of offices and 64,000 square feet of retail \u2014 and is designed by Marmol Radziner. It is expected to take more than four years to complete.\nHollywood refi\nHackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital secured a three-year, $165 million\nfinancing\npackage for Raleigh Studios. The financing will be used to repay $135 million of existing debt.\nNetflix leases most of the 314,940-square-foot Hollywood film studio as a hub for some of its biggest-budget deals that include production companies owned by Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Shonda Rhimes \u2014 the woman who gave the world\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy\n. The streaming giant is about halfway through a 10-year lease.\nHackman, Affinius, and Raleigh Enterprises are all owners: Hackman holds a 36 percent stake, Affinius 34 percent and Raleigh Enterprises 30 percent, though the latter has owned the property since 1979.\n",

        "content": "As Mayor Brandon Johnson strives to reset his standing with voters and Chicago\u2019s real estate community, some more of the city\u2019s big landlords are working to reset theirs with lenders.\nJohnson is a little over halfway through his first term, but his\nreal estate report card\nis a mixed bag. Go inside his grades on real estate-related policies according to industry players and a deputy mayor, from an A for\neliminating parking minimums\nto an F for his\nfailed transfer tax hike\n.\nLenders keep piling up lawsuits in the office market. New York-based\nFeil Organization\nis staring down foreclosure on a 35,000-square-foot West Loop loft office on Madison Street, after occupancy fell below 50 percent. It\u2019s just the latest Chicago headache for Feil, which already\nsurrendered a River North property\nand is battling\nlitigation over its LaSalle Street tower\n.\n\nIn the multifamily market, student housing\nsyndicator Versity Investments has fallen behind on $83 million in loans\ntied to The Buckingham and Tailor Lofts, two student towers near Roosevelt and UIC, respectively.\nBut bigger deals are getting back to flowing. Stuart Handler\u2019s firm\nTLC dropped $100 million on a Vernon Hills apartment complex\nto mark the highest price in the suburbs so far this year. In Chicago, developer\nNoah Properties scored a $34 million exit for The Avondale\n, a 52-unit rental townhome complex on Belmont Avenue. The buyer is eyeing a rare rental-to-condo conversion, flipping the script on a decade of deconversions.\nDevelopment site prices remain down. In the Gold Coast, investor Don Wilson\u2019s real estate firm\nConvexity scooped up a property entitled for 304 apartments\nat 1120 North State Street for $39 million, more than a third below its 2019 sale price. The parcel was once slated for a 42-story tower, but may see a fresh plan under Convexity.\nThe\nmegaproject once set to transform the Chicago River\u2019s North Branch\nis splintering some more.\nSterling Bay has put the only finished Lincoln Yards building\non the market \u2014 a vacant 284,000-square-foot lab-and-office property at 1229 West Concord. Once envisioned as the anchor to a $6 billion neighborhood, it now overlooks empty land that\nnew developers, JDL and Kayne Anderson, move ahead\nhave rebranded portions of with new plans for over 3,000 apartments.",

        "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping deportations raised an alarm for apartment associations recently, amid reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers hitting landlords with subpoenas seeking information on tenants.\nThe National Apartment Association and the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas\nissued advisories\non the federal overreach, informing members of the difference between the immediate urgency of a warrant, and a subpoena, which doesn\u2019t have to be answered right away.\nEven though Dallas-Fort Worth is the market where ICE is most actively cracking down, there is little evidence of multifamily landlords being hit with ICE subpoenas. But that has been reported in Georgia and Massachusetts.\nTexas politicians who have spoken out against ICE raids in Texas, such as U.S. Representative Greg Casar, haven\u2019t yet weighed in on the situation.\nHere\u2019s more Texas real estate news from this week.\nAustin lost an influential real estate player with the death of brokerage executive and developer\nTodd Wallace\n. Wallace, who was president of JLL\u2019s Central Texas region and CEO of CSW Development, died late last month after a six-year battle with cancer. He was 53.\n\nAshford Hospitality Trust, led by Dallas investor Monty Bennett, failed to refinance a $580 million hotel portfolio, according to the loan\u2019s special servicer, as reported by Morningstar Credit. The firm said it received an\nextension until January\nand is waiting for interest rates to drop before refinancing. The portfolio, comprising 18 hotels across 13 states (with several in Texas), went into special servicing in June after a missed balloon payment.\nThere is optimism in Austin\u2019s multifamily market, despite the area\u2019s\noversupply\nof new apartments. Occupancy dropped to 85 percent and average rents are down 7.5 percent year-over-year, making financing and valuations more difficult. However, reduced construction starts and strong absorption suggest the market may rebound next year.\nAustin-based\nCapital Commercial Investments\nacquired Energy Crossing I in West Houston, after buying its twin, Energy Crossing II, last year. The buildings, purchased from Dallas-based Invesco Real Estate, span 560,000 square feet. Capital Commercial Investments, helmed by Doug Agarwal, has been targeting newer suburban office properties amid a market trend favoring modern buildings.\nThe most expensive home sold in Houston last month was a 1938 mansion at\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\n, which was listed for $18.9 million, or $2,004 per square foot. The 1.6-acre estate includes a 9,400-square-foot main house and two additional dwellings, and was purchased by philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade.\nThe Dallas City Council unanimously rejected a proposal to ditch the city\u2019s\n\u201cpay-to-delay\u201d ordinance\n, which allows nearby property owners to postpone zoning cases for a $150 fee. The decision highlighted the divide between the council and Mayor Eric Johnson, who is pushing for streamlined development and zoning reforms.\n",

        "content": "Upwards of 20,000 apartment units in San Francisco\nare in limbo\nas projects face years of delays or fall by the wayside entirely.\nOnly 1,453 housing units were completed last year, representing less than a third of the more than 5,000 delivered in 2020. Last year, plans were filed for just 2,541 new homes. Meanwhile, the city is way behind on its state-mandated goal of permitting 82,000 units by 2031 as part of its Housing Element.\nResidential developments like\nTreasure Island\n,\nMission Rock\nand\n5M\nadded hundreds of housing units during the pandemic. But apartment starts have largely stalled in recent years as developers deal with inflation, city fees, a construction materials shortage and tariffs.\nConsider FivePoint Holdings\u2019 Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point developments. More than 10,000 homes were approved for construction in 2010, but environmental hazards and other setbacks have kept the projects in limbo. The following year, Parkmerced was approved for 5,600 new units, but construction was pushed continually before falling by the wayside entirely during the pandemic.\nA mixed-use project was set to rise at 655 Fourth Street in South of Market in 2020 but was revised and approved in 2023 for 1,110 housing units, plus office space. Like other major developments in SoMa, that project has yet to get off the ground. Nearby, other projects like\n88 Bluxome\nand the\nSan Francisco Flower Mart\nare seeking plan revisions that could include an increased focus on housing as office demand in the city claws back from pandemic lows.\nUCSF\u2019s Power Station development\nConstruction at the Power Station mixed-use development in Dogpatch is about to take a big jump forward.\nAssociate Capital and the University of California, San Francisco\nwill start construction\nnext week on an eight-story, 300,000-square-foot cancer center that will provide proton therapy and other health services to patients. UCSF bought the 50,000-square-foot parcel from Associate Capital in the spring for $75 million.\nConstruction will be funded in part by up to $575 million in tax-exempt, fixed-rate revenue bonds from the\nCalifornia Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank\n. Costs are estimated to be about $400 million.\nThe first tranche of housing at the Power Station development, the 105-unit Sophie Maxwell affordable housing project, is slated for delivery in October. Up to 2,600 homes and 1.6 million square feet of space are approved for the site.\nMadison Capital\u2019s swing for crypto HQ\nMadison Capital\nis making a play on one the largest cryptocurrency headquarters in San Francisco.\nThe New York-based investment firm bought a loan from Affinius Capital backed by 600 Battery Street, a 125,000-square-foot building near Jackson Square currently serving as the corporate home of crypto company Ripple. The sale price of the loan hasn\u2019t been disclosed, though Madison is thought to have spent more than $80 million,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\n\nAffinius predecessor Square Mile Capital originated a $106.2 million loan for the property in 2019 when TMG Partners and Invesco acquired the building for about $115 million, or $920 per square foot.\nRipple planted its flag at 600 Battery in 2022 when it leased the whole three-story building for its headquarters. It will stay in its space at the site.\nWith Madison now owning the building\u2019s debt, it could be well positioned to buy the building outright.\nSan Jose\u2019s ADU condo sale\nFor the first time ever in California, homeowners can sell accessory dwelling units as standalone condos.\nThe city of San Jose\napproved a backyard ADU\non Jos\u00e9fa Street near downtown to be sold as a condominium, utilizing Assembly Bill 1033 to make the sale happen. AB 1033 became state law last year, and San Jose was the first large city in the state to adopt the law last July.\nMayor Matt Mahan called the sale a \u201cproof of concept for California.\u201d\nThe ADU was developed by Bay Area real estate firm AlphaX RE Capital. San Jose has permitted 1,500 ADUs since 2022 and issued final building permits for more than 1,110.\nCarmel Highlands price record\nA\nmansion in Carmel Highlands\nfeatured on film and television is listed for an eye-popping price.\nThe estate at 157-163 Spindrift Road is asking $91.2 million \u2014 $7,600 per square foot and more than double the record for the most-expensive sale in Monterey County. A $45 million\nhome in Pebble Beach\nset the bar last year.\nThe property was featured in the 1992 thriller \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d as well as an episode of the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which was set in the nearby seaside enclave of Monterey.\nThe property consists of five parcels spanning 5.4 acres and six houses, including a 12,000-square-foot main house, four cottages and a new one-bedroom abode. Colorado-based software entrepreneur Gary Vickers and his wife Kerry Vickers are the sellers of the property that once belonged to world record-holding aviator Steve Fossett.\n",

        "content": "Developer and real estate attorney Isaac Kodsi\u2019s final project will be completed by members of his family following his unexpected death.\nKodsi\ndied in early August\nat the age of 59.\nHe was nearing completion of Arbor Residences, a Coconut Grove condo project that he acquired out of foreclosure in 2023. He was working closely with two of his adult children, Joseph and Camilla, at the family firm.\nKodsi\u2019s brother, condo developer Dan Kodsi, will work with Camilla to complete the 45-unit building at 3034 Oak Avenue, just north of the neighborhood\u2019s downtown, Dan tells me. Arbor has secured contracts for more than 60 percent of the building. Remaining units start at $1.7 million. Sandra Masis from Cervera Real Estate has been handling sales.\nDan says he will ensure the project is completed but that Camilla will take the lead and continue her father\u2019s legacy.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a great grip on what\u2019s happening on the property,\u201d he says. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t have that level of experience, she\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d\nIsaac lived nearby in Coconut Grove with his wife, Teresita, and their children.\nDan says that while the residential market has been slow, Arbor is priced slightly lower than other buildings in the area, giving it an advantage. The building is expected to receive its temporary certificate of occupancy by the end of the year.\nIt will mark the long-awaited next chapter for Arbor. The previous developer, a partnership led by Nick Hamann and Jeremy Waks, launched sales at Arbor in 2017 and planned to deliver the building in 2019. Completion was delayed before the pandemic.\nCamilla Kodsi wrote in a statement that completing the project, alongside her brother and uncle, \u201cis deeply personal for me.\u201d\nIsaac bought the property out of foreclosure, returned buyers\u2019 deposits and paid the general contractor and subcontractors who were owed money. Had the lender foreclosed on the site, the buyers likely would not have received their deposits back, he told me in 2023.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI\u2019m working on a story about the state of the Brickell condo market, focusing on new developments in the pipeline. What are you hearing? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\n\nResidential\n: Billionaire Russell Weiner\npaid $35.3 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 43 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach. The late Dr. David Frankel, a prominent dermatologist, owned the 11,104-square foot, eight-bedroom mansion with his wife, Linda Frankel. Weiner plans to renovate and expand the home, eventually listing it for sale for more than $100 million.\nCommercial\n: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate investment arm, Property Reserve, paid $152.5 million for a 384-unit building known as Del Ola at 7801 North Federal Highway in Boca Raton. Clarion Partners sold the apartment building.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe 14,321-square-foot, seven-bedroom estate at 2315 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach hit the market for $73 million. The 1.8-acre property, with two pools, a theater, gym, guest quarters and more, is listed with Gary Pohrer of Serhant and Nick Malinosky of Douglas Elliman. It previously\ntraded in 2022\nfor $44.9 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nWeiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, is the real owner of the waterfront home at 5300 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. He\u2019s been assembling a portfolio of ultra-luxury waterfront properties in the city in recent years.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA federal judge ordered the state to stop accepting new detainees at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d and dismantle infrastructure added to the former airport site in the Florida Everglades. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by environmental groups and a Native American tribe over the detention center\u2019s effects on the ecosystem,\nCNN\nreports. The state is appealing the ruling.\nSiemens Energy signed a 242,000-square-foot office relocation lease in Lake Nona, marking the largest office lease in Orlando since 2009 and one of the top three ever recorded in the city, according to a press release. Tavistock Group, Lake Nona\u2019s parent company, is the landlord for the building at 6876 Marwick Lane.\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Transportation ordered Miami Beach to remove its rainbow Pride crosswalks by early September, or face state removal and a bill for the costs, the\nMiami Herald\nreports. Overnight last week, FDOT painted over the rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that was a memorial to the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016.\nFlorida\u2019s Board of Education voted to end awarding certificates of completion to students with disabilities, leaving them unable to earn a diploma without any formal recognition upon graduation, according to\nCentral Florida Public Media\n.",

The house includes six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half-baths.

What about an office-to-hotel conversion?\nKensico Properties proposed converting 509 Madison Avenue in Midtown from a 21-story office to a 30-story hotel with ground-floor retail space, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Nabil Chartouni\u2019s firm filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning.\nThe conversion plans call for 96 hotel rooms, as well as a lobby and amenity spaces, all stretching across 139,000 square feet. The retail space would occupy 3,300 square space and have separate frontage from the hotel.\nA decade ago, it wasn\u2019t even clear if Kensico would be holding on to the property. In 2017, it\nput its leasehold of the office property on the market\n, despite high occupancy rates remaining strong. The leasehold never sold.\nTenants at the building today include investment firm Banyan Tree Capital Management, private equity firm Yellowstone Capital Partners and Kensico itself, all of which would likely be displaced by a conversion that doesn\u2019t appear to leave any office space behind.\nNone of the relevant players commented to the outlet about the application. Should the conversion take place, the hotel would be competing with the likes of Omni Berkshire Place, Lotte New York Palace and Hotel Elysee in the neighborhood.\n\nNew York City\u2019s hotel market is\noutperforming\nthe rest of the sector nationally in a number of key metrics, including average weekly occupancy rate \u2014 82 percent in the first half of the year, according to CoStar \u2014 and revenue per available room in the city per night, which averaged $238.93 a week.\nThe city\u2019s hotel owners are benefitting from a pair of critical legislative changes in recent years.\nA 2021 City Council bill mandated a special permit for new hotel developments, essentially\nfreezing the sector\u2019s construction pipeline\n.\nTwo years ago, the city began cracking down on short-term rentals, blocking platforms from processing payments to hosts that were either unregistered with the city or didn\u2019t have approval to rent their properties for fewer than 30 days.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties is facing a foreclosure push at one of its Downtown Brooklyn office buildings, where Rialto Capital Management alleged a $132.7 million loan default.\nRialto, acting as special servicer, filed a pre-foreclosure complaint on Aug. 21 in New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, according to\nPincusCo\n. The loan, originated in 2013 at $170 million and securitized into a Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch CMBS trust, matured in September 2023. The borrower, Forest City Myrtle Associates \u2014 controlled by Brookfield \u2014 allegedly failed to pay off the balance at maturity.\nRialto claims at least $132.7 million remains due, a total that doesn\u2019t include reserves but factors in principal, interest and default interest. The loan is secured by 115 Myrtle Avenue, a 692,000-square-foot office building formerly known as 15 MetroTech Center.

Records show the building generated $25.9 million in revenue in the most recent year, about $37 per square foot, roughly in line with its assessed market value of $132.7 million.\nFor Brookfield, the foreclosure threat comes as its New York portfolio remains heavily weighted toward office \u2014 58 percent of its holdings \u2014 with $13.8 billion in debt across city properties.\n\nThe firm isn\u2019t alone in facing maturing CMBS debt with limited refinancing options, but a foreclosure fight in Brooklyn highlights the growing risks for landlords outside Manhattan\u2019s core.\nRepresentatives for Brookfield and Rialto did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRialto\u2019s aggressive tactics have proven\nnewsworthy\nin recent months. Citywide, property owners and court records show Rialto waging war against Signature Bank borrowers, creating defaults on deals in good standing by ignoring borrowers\u2019 notices to exercise loan extensions and then suing to foreclose.\nRialto has said it is following the rules and has only enforced its rights and remedies in \u201crare instances\u201d in which sponsors defaulted and failed to communicate.

The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, which logged 23 pending deals.\nStreisand paid $420,000 for the 9,200-square-foot home in 1970. The five-story, 25-foot-wide property hit the market last June asking $18 million.\nThe Art Deco-style townhouse, built in 1930, has eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, a landscaped garden and three terraces. It also features an elevator and six wood-burning fireplaces.\nCorcoran\u2019s Cathy Franklin and Alexis Bodenheimer had the listing.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a co-op in Carnegie Hill, with an asking price just under $13 million. The pending deal price was down significantly from its last sale price of\n$16.5 million\nwhen retired advertising executive Dick Tarlow and his wife, Kristin Kehrberg, bought it roughly nine years ago.\n\nThe 19th-floor apartment at 1050 Fifth Avenue was once two separate units, which were combined and renovated in 2011. It hit the market last March asking $17 million, and though it spent more than a year searching for a new owner, the signed contract came after a bidding war.\nThe home spans 4,000 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.

        "content": "More than seven years of legal proceedings seeking damages for targeted, systemic overcharging for Section 8 tenants ended last week.\nPangea Properties was accused of systematically overcharging the Chicago Housing Authority for housing choice voucher tenants as alleged in a 2018 whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former employee of Pangea, Antoni Muhawi. The case was closed with a joint stipulation of dismissal, the Promote\nreported\n. Court records filed Aug. 18 show that unless the charges are reinstated in 30 days, the allegations are dismissed with prejudice. Any specific damages awarded to the federal government or Muhawi were not outlined in the court filings. Previously, Pangea denied committing fraud or systemic overcharging while admitting that there were some isolated cases of overcharging.\nWhistleblower complaints against Pangea\u2019s practices began a decade ago, when an investigator with CHA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General received a complaint from a voucher tenant, who was told when touring an apartment that the rent was $820 per month, according to internal emails filed as evidence in the lawsuit. But when she said she had a Section 8 voucher, Pangea told her the rent would be $970. Pangea had 1,130 units with Section 8 tenants at the time of the investigation.\nMuhawi\u2019s complaint alleged that Pangea had an \u201cestablished internal policy\u201d instructing property managers and leasing agents to quote new Section 8 tenants a monthly rent price $150 higher than the target rent for the unit, an amount that matched what the Section 8 renter told the CHA in her complaint.\n\nPangea was one of Chicago\u2019s largest landlords until it sold its portfolio of more than 400 buildings \u2014 amounting to 7,500 units \u2014 to New York-based\nEmerald Empire\nin 2022 for $600 million. It was one of the largest multifamily real estate deals in Chicago\u2019s history. The 2022 sale came after another lawsuit was filed against Pangea Properties. More than a dozen tenants accused the landlord of ignoring repeated requests for repairs, threatening their safety by deferring property maintenance.\nThe 153-page class-action\ncomplaint\nsaid Pangea racked up 5,000 reports of city violations since 2009, including no heat in the winter and rodent and insect infestations.\nEarlier this\nmonth\nThe Real Deal\nreported that Fannie Mae and Emerald entered a forbearance agreement on at least $125 million worth of loans associated with the purchase of Pangea\u2019s holdings.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The South Bay retail market had a tough second quarter.\nSilicon Valley retail vacancy increased, and asking rents dropped in April through June, compared to the previous three months, the Mercury News\nreported\n, citing Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The exit of several national retailers, such as\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nand Barnes &amp; Noble, was partially to blame.\nThe South Bay saw a retail vacancy rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter, up from 4.7 percent in the first quarter, when vacancies hit a six-year low in the area. Retail rents fell from about $2.92 per square foot in the first quarter to $2.81 in the second.\nSome parts of Silicon Valley and the South Bay fared better than others. The retail vacancy rate in\nSunnyvale\nand\nCupertino\nwas 3.1 percent, while North San Jose and Milpitas were at 4.5 percent.\nPalo Alto\n, Mountain View and Los Altos had a 5.1 percent vacancy rate, while downtown San Jose, south San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell registered a 5.4 percent retail vacancy. The markets in the area with the highest retail vacancy rates were Santa Clara with 5.5 percent and Morgan Hill and Gilroy at 7.5 percent.\n\nWhile the trend might raise some concerns, investors don\u2019t appear to be shaken and are looking toward the long term in the South Bay.\nLast December, Arc Capital Partners and Milan Capital Management bought The Plant shopping center in San Jose for $95 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. After that purchase, a supermarket and discount store moved into spaces that had been empty and several new leases at the property were signed.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, retail centers have begun finding more tenants for previously vacant spaces. At Almaden Plaza in south San Jose, for example, the former homes of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Barnes &amp; Noble have been filled by Hobby Lobby with a 62,000-square-foot lease and Sports Basement renting 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Charles Cohen is eking out a little liquidity.\nVornado has entered an agreement to buy Cohen\u2019s Manhattan office tower at 623 Fifth Avenue for $218 million, the company announced Monday.\nA sale would help pay off Cohen\u2019s nearly $200 million judgement to Fortress Credit Corp. But the price was likely less than he was hoping for; The property was valued at nearly three times that amount, $640 million, in 2023, according to a financial statement filed with the court.\nCohen\u2019s fight with Fortress is a result of personally guaranteeing a $534 million loan portfolio. When the billionaire defaulted, Fortress waged war, going after the his personal assets. He lost the buildings backing the loans when Fortress took them in what was among\nthe largest UCC foreclosures of all time\n.\nThe lender scored a\n$187 million judgement\nin the case in March. With interest, that is now $194.4 million before legal fees, according to a letter from Fortress to the court.\nBut Cohen says he needs to sell his assets first. Fortress has accused him of dragging his feet, and is seeking to appoint a receiver for the buildings.\nCohen\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, have said he\u2019s motivated to sell.\n\n\u201cFortress\u2019s aggressive pursuit of Mr. Cohen is doing nothing more than interfering with efforts to maximize the value of his assets and generate the most amount of liquidity to pay down the Judgment,\u201d his lawyers wrote to the court in June.\nBetween April and the end of June, Cohen\u2019s representatives met with five different buyers to discuss a sale of 623 Fifth, according to a letter from his lawyers to the judge. The letter from law firm Blank Rome to the court also describes a publicly traded REIT in talks to purchase the property \u2014 likely Vornado \u2014 alongside a hotel operator and two New York City developers.\nThe 36-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue is more than 352,000 square feet and owned by a company that Cohen fully controls. He had intended to convert the building into residential units. As such, it\u2019s 75 percent vacant, according to the release from Vornado.\nThe Midtown-based real estate firm doesn\u2019t intend to move forward with the conversion, instead intending to redevelop the tower as a Class A office building. Vornado said it plans to close the deal next month and to finish the redevelopment in 2027.\nFortress declined to comment. Cohen Brothers Realty as well as Donald Harwood, an attorney for Cohen in the Fortress case with Harwood Reif LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAt least four of Cohen\u2019s properties are in foreclosure proceedings, including one that he intends to sell, 3 East 54th Street, according to a letter from Fortress to the court.\n",

Nearly a fifth of them would also be reserved specifically for formerly homeless individuals.\nThe 66,000-square-foot lot is largely vacant, zoned for light manufacturing use. The site, which Phipps wants to be altered to allow for medium-density residential use, is bound by Intervale Avenue, East 169th Street and Kelly Street.\nThe project would be anywhere from six to 12 stories tall and include nearly 6,000 square feet of community facility space. There would also be amenities, including two laundry rooms, a fitness room, a playroom, bicycle storage and a doorman.\nThe nonprofit did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\n\nPhipps has been involved in major residential developments in New York City before. A couple of years ago, it scored\na $225 million construction loan\nfor a 436-unit affordable housing complex on Euclid Avenue in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn.\nThe project represented one of three the nonprofit housing developer plotted between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue.\nDevelopment is springing up all over the South Bronx. Last month, Scale Lending provided\na $305 million loan\nto the Beitel Group for its 755-unit project at 355 Exterior Street.\nLast summer, Arian Liton filed plans for a 99-unit mixed-use project at 36 Bruckner Boulevard.

The site is in the Country Walk neighborhood, south of Miami Executive Airport.\nDevelopment of the project, called Tamiami Logistics Center, has started, Whitfield Hamilton, the firm\u2019s CEO, said in a news release. Construction is expected to be completed in the spring of next year, the release says.\nLast year, Hamilton filed an application for administrative site plan approval to Miami-Dade officials. The county approved the project this year, records show.\nThe development site is within a 9.5-acre property. Hamilton only purchased the portion of the property, including the 42,000-square-foot office building, where Hamilton will build Tamiami Logistics Center. The office building was completed in 1979.\nBaptist Health kept ownership of its emergency room on the property, records show.\n\nJose and Sebastian Juncadella are part of the Fairchild Partners team leasing Tamiami Logistics Center.\nWhitfield Hamilton founded his eponymously named firm in 2023 after a nearly two-decade career as regional partner at Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development Company. Former Panattoni executives Scott Abbott, Bill Hudgins, Jeff Konieczny and Hayne Hamilton also are founding partners of Hamilton.\nThe firm has projects underway in 12 markets in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic areas.\nAt Miami-Dade\u2019s Flagler Station business park, Hamilton plans three warehouses in place of the office buildings at 9675, 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, records show. The properties are in an unincorporated area of the county.\nIn May, Hamilton acquired the building at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue from Bridge Investment Group through a deed-in lieu of foreclosure, and it paid\n$20.8 million\nfor the building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue. Hamilton also filed a $59.3 million foreclosure suit against Bridge Investment on the building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue, records show.\nSouth Florida suburban offices are getting\nredeveloped\ninto industrial and multifamily projects.

        "content": "A year after selling a Lincoln Park mansion for $35 million under asking, Richard and Michaela Parrillo downsized to a $6.5 million Gold Coast penthouse in July.\nThe couple bought the discounted 6,800-square-foot condo at 1300 North State Parkway for $956 per square foot. The two-story penthouse has five bedrooms and six bathrooms.\nThe buyers, United Automobile Insurance Company chairman and CEO Richard Parrillo and his wife made headlines when they set the record for the most expensive single-family home sale in Chicago with the sale of their\nLincoln Park mansion\nfor $15.25 million in August 2024. The home was initially listed for $50 million and sold at a steep loss.\nThe condo was sold under a land trust that obscures the sellers\u2019 identities. But documents from 2016 list the previous owners as Christian Zann and Amy Everard. Zann, the chief investment officer at Sourcerock Group, was an asset manager for Balyasny in Chicago until 2019.\n\nTimothy Salm of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyer in the deal, and he previously represented the Parrillos on the $15.25 million Lincoln Park deal. Rachel Krueger, also of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s, represented the seller. Salm declined to comment, and Krueger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe condo last sold in August 2015 for $6.9 million. In October 2022, it went up for sale asking $8 million, about a 15 percent increase. But the home proved difficult to sell in the weaker downtown market. The listing was removed in August 2023 and put back up for sale in February 2024 with a $1 million price cut.\nThen in June 2024, it was listed for rent at $30,000 a month, but the listing was removed a month later.\nThe condo is a significant downsize from the 25,000-square-foot estate in Lincoln Park the Parrillos sold last year. The couple spent $65 million acquiring the land and building the six-bedroom, 11-bathroom house, Crains previously reported.\nThe Lincoln Park mansion\u2019s buyer was David Cocagne, CEO of Vermilion Development. Cocagne\u2019s Vermilion is\ndeveloping a 447-unit\n, 31-story apartment tower in Evanston, which would be the city\u2019s tallest building.",

        "content": "The yearslong fight over Pepper Square is over, and the developer came out on top.\nThe Save Pepper Square Neighborhood Association dropped its lawsuit against Dallas and developer Henry S. Miller Company, ending a high-profile zoning dispute that had stalled plans to redevelop the aging Far North Dallas shopping center, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe Dallas-based firm is moving ahead with a $200 million mixed-use project with 868 apartments on the 15.5-acre site near Preston and Belt Line roads. The maximum height was set to 165 feet by the Dallas City Council, and a minimum of 35,000 square feet of retail, office or other personal service business space must be set aside. Miller originally pushed for as many as 2,000 units at the site before negotiations with City Hall slashed the density.\nThe outcome underscores the sweeping impact of a new Texas law that could accelerate redevelopment of aging retail centers across Texas. For developers, it opens the door to higher-density plays on underperforming commercial sites. Set to take effect Sept. 1, the law requires cities to allow\nmixed-use residential\nand multifamily development in a zoning classification that allows office, retail or industrial development and applies to cities with more than 150,000 residents located in counties with more than 300,000 people.\n\nMatt Bach, who led the neighborhood opposition group, told the outlet that winning the lawsuit would have been a hollow victory once the law takes effect, prompting the organization to\ndrop\nthe case.\nThe developer expects to start construction by the end of next year, starting with a midrise fronting Belt Line Road and moving next to an eight-story building along Preston. Gregory Miller, president of Henry S. Miller Company, said the new law would let him pack in closer to 1,900 units, but market fundamentals make that unrealistic. The project\u2019s scale was cut substantially, as the originally proposed\n12-story tower\nand higher apartment number was scrapped.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer David Martin is now involved in Michael Stern\u2019s planned luxury condo tower in Miami Beach, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nState records show that in late July,\nMartin\u2019s\nname and Terra\u2019s address were added to LLCs that are tied to the planned project. JDS Pulse, an anonymous blog that\nStern sued in May\n, first disclosed Terra\u2019s involvement.\nMartin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra does have an interest in the deal to develop the condo project at 1250 West Avenue, a spokesperson for Terra confirmed.\nGianluca Vacchi\u2019s\nGV Development and RG Development are also partners in the project. A statement from JDS said that Terra is part of the development team for the project.\nThe developers did not disclose additional details.\nRecords show JDS and its partners have purchased at least two dozen condos at the building at 1250 West Avenue, which is home to the 15-story, circa-1964 Bay Garden Manor condos. It has 238 units. The developer\u2019s 1250 West Ave LLC has been in contract to acquire the remaining majority of units, and could close on them soon, according to sources.\n\nThe JDS-led LLC secured a\ncontentious approval this summer\nfrom the Miami Beach City Commission that will allow for a taller and slimmer tower on the bayfront West Avenue site, which is next to the Stern-developed Monad Terrace luxury condo project.\nThe new building at 1250 West Avenue can be up to 330 feet tall, more than double what was allowed as of right. But a reduction in density brings the maximum number of condos down to 125 units from the 286 allowed by right.\nThe JDS-led venture will redevelop the Bikini Hostel property across the street at 1247 West Avenue as part of a public benefits package it\u2019s providing to the city. The developer has been in contract to buy the property for months. Stern declined to disclose the purchase price at a recent commission meeting.\nThe commission granted final approvals to the development agreement and zoning amendments at a special meeting in late June, where Martin also secured an upzoning for the\nDeauville Beach Resort\nproperty. Martin is a 25 percent owner of that property; the controversial Meruelo family holds the majority interest.\nMartin has a history of involving himself in tricky deals, including the Deauville project. He was working on a bulk purchase of the Castle Beach Club property, an aging condo building in Miami Beach, but that\ndeal expired early last year.\nDevelopers have been increasingly joining forces with their competitors, bringing on additional equity partners or forming a joint venture partnership with other developers as they deal with rising costs. Earlier this year, Martin partnered with Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group to pay a\nrecord $205 million\nfor a Key Biscayne development site where they plan a 56-unit ultra-luxury condo building.\n",

        "content": "After a post-primary spike in donations from real estate executives, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaign saw contributions from the industry level off.\nReal estate donors gave Adams a little more than $60,500 between July 12 and August 18, according to the latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board. That\u2019s down considerably from the more than $480,000 he received from the industry between June 25 and July 11, following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s defeat in the Democratic primary.\nThe sudden boost from the industry was\nseen\nas an early sign that real estate professionals \u2014\u00a0who had rallied behind Cuomo\u2019s campaign leading up to the primary \u2014\u00a0were shifting support to the mayor\u2019s re-election bid.\nBut over the last month, Adams, who is running as an independent, has ranked fourth in multiple\npolls\n, trailing behind Assembly member and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Though he escaped federal corruption charges himself, allegations have continued to plague his inner circle. Last week, current and former members of his administration were\nindicted\non charges related to speeding up construction approvals and steering contracts to certain developers.\nThe real estate contributions during the latest filing period \u2014 based on donors who self-reported working within various sectors of the industry \u2014 represent roughly 14 percent of the total $425,000 Adams brought in over the last month. During the previous filing period, he received $1.5 million in total donations.\nTodd Shapiro, a spokesperson for the Adams campaign, brushed off any suggestion that the latest donations indicate waning enthusiasm among industry players. He pointed to a number of fundraisers held by real estate executives after the primary.\nSL Green Realty\u2019s Marc Holliday hosted a fundraiser for Adams in July, and employees of the real estate investment trust\ndonated\nmore than $67,000 to the mayor\u2019s re-election period after the primary. Shapiro noted that the donations and fundraisers happen at different times, and looking at one filing period fails to account for big-picture support from the industry.\n\u201cThe real estate industry wholeheartedly supports Mayor Eric Adams,\u201d he said.\nBefore news of the indictments, as well as\nreports\nthat one of his campaign advisors handed a reporter a potato chip bag stuffed with cash, real estate executives gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams.\nAn LLC tied to Two Trees Management gave the super PAC $100,000 on August 11. GFP Real Estate\u2019s Jeff Gural contributed $25,000 on August 15. In an email, Gural said he still thinks Adams is the best choice, but acknowledged that the \u201clatest batch of arrests make it much harder for that to happen.\u201d He doesn\u2019t, however, intend to support another candidate.\nDeveloper Gary Barnett gave the PAC $250,000 on July 2, and billionaire Alexander Rovt donated $15,000 on June 6. Officials paused a city office lease at Rovt\u2019s 14 Wall Street in November amid questions of whether the property got special treatment because of Rovt\u2019s previous support of Adams. The administration ultimately allowed the lease to\nmove\nforward.\n\nThose who gave the Adams campaign the maximum $2,100 include Tao Group Hospitality co-CEOs Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, based out of Manhattan and Las Vegas, respectively; Harry Bajraktari, whose eponymous Bronx firm owns and manages more than 70 buildings; Corcoran broker Dana Power; Nest Seekers broker Andy Kim; Adam Falk, a principal and co-portfolio manager at BH3 Management in Manhattan; Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Gil Gideon; and Broadway Construction Group\u2019s Joseph Aiello.\nLandlord Paul Gjonaj gave $1,000, while his brother, former Bronx Council member Mark Gjonaj, also an owner and property manager, gave $500. The former Council member, who had been subject to a\nprobe\nrelated to government contracts awarded to campaign donors (no charges or discipline were ever announced), dropped his bid for re-election in 2021, telling City &amp; State that the \u201ccurrent political climate is not favorable to a centrist ideology.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s donations from the industry have bounced back since the last filing period. Over the last month, he brought in a little more than $53,700 from the real estate industry. After the primary through July 11, he only received $2,115 in total, with a $25 donation from one real estate agent (at the time, Cuomo\u2019s team indicated that the campaign had stopped fundraising after maxing out on donations ahead of the primary).\nRFR Realty\u2019s Charles and Gabriel Rosen each gave $2,100 in August. Others who gave the maximum amount to Cuomo during this filing period include Icon Realty Management\u2019s Todd Cohen, CBRE\u2019s Ken Meyerson, Florida developer Peter Brock and Rob Vecsler, CEO of Hyperion Group, a development firm based in Manhattan and Miami.\nBetween July 12 and August 18, the Cuomo campaign reported receiving just over $472,500 in donations. The campaign also transferred\n$68,000 from a state account\n.\nThe super PAC, Fix the City, received millions of dollars from industry donors in the lead-up to the primary. The PAC has indicated that it will still support Cuomo in the general election, but it hasn\u2019t received many contributions from real estate donors since the June primary. Equity Residential gave it $10,000 earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Mamdani reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. Though many in the industry have been critical of Mamdani\u2019s policies,\nsome have donated\nto his campaign. They tend, however, to be nonprofit or affordable developers or otherwise smaller industry players.\nOne developer who donated to Mamdani explained that his support was a product simply of Mamdani being the Democratic nominee, and that the developer\u2019s kids are roughly the same age as the Assembly member and are supporting him.\nMamdani\u2019s latest filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors. That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nOver the last month, Sliwa raised roughly $406,400, with more than $9,000 coming from real estate donors. Attorney Jim Walden, who is running as an independent, received a total of $8,200 over the last month and reported some small donations from construction professionals.\n",

        "content": "Thrive Living\u2019s affordable housing development in East Hollywood is moving forward with the help of a $65 million construction loan.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer, an affiliate of New York-based Magnum Real Estate Group, secured the loan from J.P. Morgan for a seven-story building at 1141 North Vermont Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe development will feature 290 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units for residents making up to 80 percent of the area median income. In Los Angeles County, this is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual income of $84,850 for one person or $121,450 for a household of four.\nTo bring the 1141 Vermont development to life, Thrive Living will use prefabricated modular units, thus allowing for a speedier construction timeline. Work on the site could be completed within 14 months, according to Urbanize. The property will feature amenities like a rooftop deck, a community room and various landscaped outdoor spaces.\nAnother modular Thrive Living project, a 376-unit development at 1457 North Main Street in Chinatown, also benefited from a J.P. Morgan construction loan, per Urbanize. By using modular construction there, Thrive\nexpects\nto cut costs by 15 percent.\n\nThe area near the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro station, where the 1141 Vermont development will rise, is in the midst of a transformation as other affordable housing projects get underway nearby.\nOutside the train station entrance, Little Tokyo Service Center built a 187-unit affordable housing complex, while one block to the east, Jamison Properties is similarly building a 177-unit mixed-income development.\nPrefabricated modular projects such as Thrive Living\u2019s latest East Hollywood endeavor are proving to be beneficial in the Los Angeles area for both single-family and multifamily developments.\nIn the wake of January\u2019s deadly wildfires, some homeowners in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones have turned to\nprefabricated models\nto erect\ntemporary housing\non their property. As Altadena, the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other surrounding areas emerge from the ashes, modular housing could end up being a boon for these homeowners .\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "How much did Waterton pay for the Warner Center?\nIt shelled out $167.4 million for the Woodland Hills apartment complex, property records reveal.\nWaterton\npurchased\nthe 522 apartments from AMLI Residential last month, but a price was not disclosed.\nAMLI Residential developed the property almost two decades ago. The complex at 21200 Kittridge Street is now called The Kitt at Warner Center and boasts a resort-inspired pool and spa, al fresco dining and an outdoor fireplace. The value-add, Chicago-based investor plans to renovate the one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and revamp common areas.\n\n\u201cWhat made it attractive was primarily the value-add upside. The vast majority of units are in either original condition from 2007 or have been partially upgraded over the years. The common areas and amenities can be reconfigured and improved,\u201d Kol Rath, vice president of acquisitions at Waterton, said when the deal was announced. The company, founded and helmed by David Schwartz, owns thousands of apartments in Los Angeles.\nThe Kitt at Warner Center is within a master-planned community, the Warner Center, where the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams, Stanley Kroenke, has proposed a $10 billion\ndevelopment\n.\nWoodland Hills has a 4.3 percent multifamily vacancy rate, and commands $2,788 average rent per apartment, according to a second-quarter CBRE market\nreport\n. That\u2019s on par with typical vacancies and rents throughout the Los Angeles market. The highest multifamily sale price for that period was $126 million for a 235-unit apartment building in Glendale, according to the report.\nWaterton has been pretty active, on the buy and sell side. The company recently began\nmarketing\ntwo 14-story apartment buildings in Chicago. Waterton paid about $82 million for the complex, called Grand Central, two years earlier. In another deal, last year Waterton\npurchased\na San Francisco complex encompassing seven six-story buildings from Brookfield for $177.5 million.\nAMLI last summer\nsold\na 325-unit apartment complex for around $89 million in South Florida.",

        "content": "Dry Creek Capital is getting in position to gain a second foothold in the office market with distressed debt deals surrounding Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nThe Denver-based firm acquired the loan note for the $47.3 million non-performing mortgage tied to the O\u2019Hare International Center, a two-building, 530,000-square-foot property at 10255 and 10275 Higgins Road in Rosemont, Steve Emerson of Dry Creek confirmed. The property is owned by Utah-based Bridge Investment Group\nThe loan note traded for about $26.5 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. Emerson declined to discuss the price. But a transaction for that amount would have dealt a blow to Alabama-based lender Regions Bank, which originated a $50 million mortgage loan to Bridge in 2018 for the landlord\u2019s $64 million purchase of the property. Bridge poured another $8 million into improvements during its ownership, meaning the landlord is feeling some financial pain as the property\u2019s value is likely well below its investment.\nThe deal sets Dry Creek up to seize the property from Bridge, though Emerson said the path forward is still being discussed between the companies. The asset is 76 percent leased, according to JLL.\nThis is the buyer\u2019s second distressed debt acquisition in the O\u2019Hare office market. Dry Creek seized the 210,000-square-foot building at 25 Northwest Point Boulevard in Elk Grove Village earlier this summer from a venture of Michigan-based landlord Farbman Group.\nIt may not be Dry Creek\u2019s last deal in the area, either, though it has recently been active in the Washington, D.C., region, Emerson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ton of dry powder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mainly purchase loans from banks.\u201d\nBridge and Farbman are far from the only victims of the downturn for suburban Chicago office properties. The sector is rough for landlords, as vacancy is hovering near record highs of over 30 percent on average, with demand from tenants shrinking as companies cut space while remote and hybrid work schedules linger and interest rates are elevated. Landlords are being forced to offer steep concessions just to attract or keep tenants.\nOn top of that, landlords are skittish about sinking more money into their properties when leasing absorption has been negative for years, leaving a lot of suburban offices stuck in limbo.\nDry Creek stripped Farbman of the Northwest Point property two years after buying the loan note for the building, which took its second consecutive nosedive in value as the former landlord\u2019s loan came due, Cook County property records show. Farbman bought the property for just under $20 million in 2013 from a John Buck Company venture that had bought it in 2007 for $31.5 million. Farbman used a $16 million mortgage loan from KeyBank to finance its acquisition, and distressed debt specialist Dry Creek acquired the note in 2023.\nJLL\u2019s Tom Hall, Kyle Kaminski, Pat Shields and Sam DiFrancesca marketed the O\u2019Hare International Center loan for sale.\n",

        "content": "Boutique office properties are drawing the attention of real estate firms looking for big discounts on well-positioned buildings.\nThat\u2019s the case with a deal inked last week by Chicago-based Cubed Real Estate and developer R2, who jointly paid just shy of $5 million for a River North loft office building, which the lender had seized a year prior, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That puts the price at about $95 per square foot. The six-story, 52,500-square-foot building at 225 West Ohio Street was sold well below its going price a decade earlier of $13.3 million. Green Bay-based lender Associated Bank seized the property last year to resolve an outstanding loan on the building.\nAssociated took over the deed in a foreclosure from Dallas-based Transwestern Investment Group last summer. Transwestern refinanced the property in 2020 with a $9.4 million mortgage from Associated. Transwestern paid down the loan balance by $2.7 million, buying an extension beyond the original maturity date in 2023, but eventually the lender seized it.\nThe discounted price reflects the struggle office buildings have faced across the country post-pandemic, as high interest rates and work-from-home policies became the norm.\n\nCubed and R2 are betting on discounted offices increasing in value amid the trend of converting larger office towers into residential, removing some competition, Cubed principal Eric Weber told the outlet.\nThe River North building is 78 percent leased, and the buyers plan to lease it up. The largest tenant in the building is engineering and landscape design firm Terra Engineering. R2 has been testing investor interest in net-leased properties, which are characterized by a single long-term tenant covering most operational costs.\nThe purchase follows a\ntrend\nfor R2, which purchased another six-story building in\nRiver North\nearlier in August.The 70,000-square-foot\noffice\nproperty at 303 West Erie Street sold for $7.5 million, and it followed a similar steep discount pattern. The seller, New York-based Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, paid double that for the building in 2017.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Glencoe officials are debating how far the village should go to preserve its historic housing stock, as teardown pressure chips away at the North Shore suburb\u2019s architectural legacy.\nThe Preservation Commission pitched a package of new incentives, from tax rebates to permit fee discounts, aimed at encouraging owners to landmark their properties, the Record North Shore\nreported\n. But trustees balked at the potential price tag, questioning whether the village should shoulder the cost of keeping older homes intact.\nGlencoe designates homes in three categories: \u201ccertified landmarks,\u201d which carry strict protections and qualify for state and local incentives; \u201chonorary landmarks,\u201d subject only to demolition delays and advisory reviews; and \u201chistorically significant\u201d homes, which come with no regulatory teeth. Since 2013, when the state limited tax benefits to certified landmarks only, honorary designations have plummeted \u2014 and demolitions have picked up. Just three homes have received honorary status in the past 12 years, compared with 92 between 1990 and 2013. Eight honorary landmarks have been torn down since 2013, nearly matching the 13 lost over the prior two decades.\nIn an effort to reverse the trend, the commission proposed giving certified landmark owners rebates of up to 90 percent on building permit fees and $2,000 annual property tax breaks for eight years. Honorary landmarks would qualify for 50 percent fee rebates. Both programs would be capped annually to control village costs.\n\nThe group also asked trustees to consider zoning incentives, such as flexible setbacks and height allowances, as a lower-cost way to make preservation more appealing. Other recommendations included doubling demolition delays to 360 days and requiring owners to consent to honorary designations. The Village Board asked staff for more detail and is set to revisit the issue at its Sept. 18 meeting.\nThe question of preservation versus development is also being put to the test in other high-end\nChicagoland\nsuburbs. Last year, buyers in Winnetka wanted to tear down a $12.3 million historic mansion known as the\nClement Stone Mansio\nn, at 445 Sheridan Road, a Spanish revival built in 1912. And after rolling out an anti-teardown incentives package in\nHinsdale\nthree years ago, that town\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission changed the minds of the buyers of a 1930s colonial mansion set to be demolished.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A month\u2019s worth of political donations isn\u2019t the definitive record of who the real estate industry is supporting in the mayoral race.\nIt is, however, a pulse check. Leading up to the primary, the big industry players were overwhelmingly donating to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. That changed after he lost, and then Mayor Eric Adams saw a sudden surge in industry donations. He brought in more than $489,000 from real estate donors after the primary, up through July 11.\nNow we have the latest donations, received between July 12 through August 18:\nZohran Mamdani\nReal estate donations: $19,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $1 million\nEric Adams\nReal estate donations: $60,545\nTotal contributions reported this period: $425,181\nAndrew Cuomo\nReal estate donations: $53,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $472,537 (plus a $68,225 transfer from a state fund)\nCurtis Sliwa\nReal estate donations: $9,939\nTotal contributions reported this period: $406,392\nJim Walden\n\nReal estate donations: $250\nTotal contributions reported this period: $8,222\nThe bottom line? The industry is still by and large supporting Adams and Cuomo. Donations to the mayor have slowed since the last filing period, but that seemed to be driven by an immediate (panicked) reaction to Cuomo\u2019s primary loss.\nThe next filing deadline is Oct. 3, at which point we should have a better sense of whether the industry is deciding to pull back further on its spending ahead of the general election. Of course, if someone drops out, everything could change.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill anyone drop out of the mayoral race before the general election? Have you heard anything about the land use ballot questions lately? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe term synanthrope (undomesticated creatures that live in close proximity to humans, such as rats, pigeons or squirrels) comes from the Greek \u201csyn,\u201d meaning \u201ctogether with\u201d and anthropos, which is \u201cman,\u201d according to the book \u201cThe 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to The Hidden World of Everyday Design.\u201d\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 former chief advisor, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted last week on charges that she accepted kickbacks, including a brief cameo on the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem\u201d, in exchange for interfering with a controversial traffic redesign. But she isn\u2019t the only member of the mayor\u2019s inner circle to get a gig with the show.\nGothamist\nreported that Adams\u2019 son, Jordan Coleman, acted as personal assistant to actor Forest Whitaker during the show\u2019s second season, in what was described by two production employees as a \u201cpolitical hire.\u201d\n\u2014 Gothamist\nprofiled\nDrew Warshaw, who is emerging as a challenger to state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Warshaw\u2019s platform focused on the affordability crisis. As part of his campaign, he wants to invest $10 billion of the state pension fund into affordable housing projects.\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign held a scavenger hunt over the weekend,\nNewsweek\nreported. The activity dovetailed with the mayoral candidate\u2019s campaign promise of fast, free buses, as participants used public transit to cross the city to various stops, several of them transit-themed. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit at 63 West 17th Street for\n$7.8 million\n. The unit at The Lyla Condominium is 4,100 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nThe Davis Team.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.4 million\nfor 856 Greene Avenue. The Bedford-Stuyvesant rental building is three stories, has six units and is 5,800 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7 million for a penthouse unit at 545 West 110th Street. The Morningside Heights condo is 3,100 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nDeirdre De Risi and Marissa Galletti have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 222,596-square-foot, six-story school building at 153-10 Hillside Avenue in Queens. Carrie Moore of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That\u2019s $2,266 per square foot. The venture capitalist\nlisted the property\nat 164 Elena Avenue for more than $33 million last year. The buyer\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nAndreessen paid $16.6 million for the home in 2007. The cofounder of the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm and early web browsers Mosaic and Netscape moved in the year after marrying Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, daughter of billionaire developer John Arrillaga who helped build up Silicon Valley into the tech hub it is today.\nThe main house boasts two kitchens, seven fireplaces and media entertainment options via \u201cvisible and concealed screens,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nBesides the main home, the property also has a one-bedroom guest house, a detached studio and a four-car garage partially converted into an office space. The home has a reflecting pool, fountains and a pergola; however, there\u2019s no swimming pool or sports court.\nAndreessen dropped more than $250 million on three properties in Malibu in 2021 and 2022. He, along with basketball power couple Steph and Ayesha Curry, objected to Atherton city officials adding density to the town at that time.\nAtherton has become a go-to escape for Silicon Valley\u2019s tech titans over the past decade.

Schmidt\noffloaded\nhis Atherton property last year and\nspent $24 million\non a three-bedroom apartment in San Francisco\u2019s swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood.\nAndreessen\u2019s Atherton home sale price represents about half of the year\u2019s priciest sale in the Peninsula town.

        "content": "The most expensive residential property that sold in Austin last week is a suburban compound that sleeps 32 people, according to the Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate.\nThe estate at 1304 Bouldin Avenue packs 15 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, eight parking spots and a heated pool into a quarter of an acre. The sale price of the 6,400-square-foot property isn\u2019t available, but it was asking $5 million when it sold after 101 days on the market, about $777 per square foot and $1 million higher than its last tax appraisal.\nThe listing agent, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Jeff Burke, didn\u2019t mince words in the listing summary: This single-family home is a business. The Bouldin Compound, as it\u2019s known on Vrbo, is projected to generate $700,000 in revenue this year as a short-term rental. (It\u2019s booked already for Labor Day weekend.) Catering to corporate retreats, the property managers have planned a conference area among other renovations. They\u2019re also \u201cactively working to build partnerships with major events like SXSW, ACL, F1 and the BLAST.tv Major, one of the world\u2019s largest e-sports tournaments,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nThe Bouldin Creek neighborhood is just across the river from downtown Austin and the Rainey Street Historic District, a nightlife hotspot.\nThe property has changed hands three times since it was built in 2018, and every owner after the original \u2014 a couple named Samuel and Lucia Ruiz \u2014 has been a business. The seller, an LLC registered to Adam Coleman, acquired the property last summer. Travis County hasn\u2019t published records relating to the sale yet.\nThe Bouldin Compound shouldered a West Austin new build to second place in the city\u2019s most-expensive residential sales last month. A five-bedroom mansion on 0.62 acres at 1604 Barclay Drive was asking $3.9 million when it sold last week.\n",

        "content": "The developers of a $1 billion project in Leander were dealt another setback by the Austin suburb.\nAustin-based iLand Development Group\u2019s updated plans for the 78-acre Leander Springs project was denied by the Leander City Council last week, Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The unanimous vote denied amendments to its public utility district agreement with the city, further delaying any dirt moving on the ambitious mixed-use project centered around a 4-acre artificial lagoon, which was first announced five years ago.\nThe developer requested amendments to reduce the required number of apartments from 1,600 to 1,200, as well as some changes to the timeline. It asked for removal of the date required for certificate of completion on the lagoon, and to remove the time requirement for hotel construction and delivery. The PUD requires the hotel to be complete by the end of 2028.\nThe amendment also would\u2019ve removed the requirement that the Lagoon be open to the public, with admission offered at a discount to Leander residents.\nKey sticking points in moving the development forward have been water usage, stakeholder investment, a terminated\n$22 million\ncity incentive package \u2014 lost by tapping the federal EB-5 program, which trades permanent resident status to foreign investors and their families in exchange for investment in commercial enterprises. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\u2019s website lists a permit application for an entity tied to the project to discharge up an average of 1.4 million gallons of treated effluent and stormwater per day. Leander Mayor Christine DeLisle has long been skeptical of the project due to concerns over water usage.\n\nAnother request in the PUD amendment was to designate the lagoon as a \u201cnon-essential use\u201d in terms of water so that it would have had to comply with conservation.\nAfter\u00a0 the Aug. 21 meeting, iLand said in a statement that the company is eager to move forward with the project, and that the water management plan presented to the City Council and residents is robust. iLand dropped Miami-based Crystal Lagoons as the lagoon developer, and Austin-based VVater has replaced it.\nThe setbacks don\u2019t stop with just water-use concerns for the project, at FM 2243 and the 183A frontage, intended to transform Leander into a\nCentral Texas\ndestination. Since announcing the project in 2020, iLand has faced setbacks that include $3 million in liens to contractors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The leases bring the property\u2019s occupancy to 80 percent, according to a release from property owners Glenstar and Singerman Real Estate, which are based in Chicago.\nThe resi brokerage, which had a 17,000-square-foot office in Grapevine, will occupy 18,000 square feet on the first floor of the 278,000-square-foot Building 8 starting in September.\nIn addition, workforce development company Pluralsight moved its headquarters from Draper, Utah, to a 26,000-square-foot space in Building 6. Defense contractor M1 Support Services is shifting its headquarters from Denton to Building 5 of Terraces, where it inked a deal for 26,000 square feet of the 124,000-square-foot building.\nThe leasing momentum at the property follows a $25 million renovation completed in 2021. The campus now has 50,000 square feet of amenity space, including a restaurant, conference center, gym and covered parking.\n\nThe amenities sealed the deal for Century 21 Mike Bowman, said president Dave Bowman. Specifically, the brokerage will be able to host national events in the conference center.\nThese wins for the property speak to the strength of the office market in Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. Companies are eager to locate closer to where employees live, in places like Westlake, which is an upscale suburb about 30 miles northwest of Dallas.\nHalfway through the year, JLL reported positive net absorption for the North Texas office market. It was highest in the second quarter in suburbs like Plano, McKinney and Irving\u2019s Las Colinas area.\nVacancy is stuck at 27.7 percent across Dallas-Fort Worth, according to JLL. The high rate is attributable to empty space in the region\u2019s office properties built in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\nThe vacancy rate has declined for Class A properties, CBRE reported, highlighting the continued prevalence of the flight-to-quality trend that has office users seeking properties with high-end amenities to lure their remote workers back to the office.\n",

        "content": "Dallas has been working behind the scenes to map out a new home for the Mavericks, even as officials keep the details under wraps.\nThe city hired Hillwood Urban Services this spring under a $75,000 consulting deal to identify potential sites for a new NBA arena, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The three-month contract \u2014 approved administratively without City Council sign-off \u2014 tasked Hillwood with site evaluations, feasibility analysis and final recommendations for where the Mavs might land after their lease at American Airlines Center expires in 2031, in time to open an arena by the 2031-2032 NBA season.\nNeither the city nor Hillwood, the developer behind the AAC and Victory Park, disclosed what sites were studied. Dallas rejected a public records request\u00a0 from the outlet for related documents, citing confidentiality exemptions tied to economic development negotiations. The city appealed to the Texas Attorney General to keep the information sealed, saying disclosure would reveal incentive offers still in play.\n\nThe cloak-and-dagger approach comes as speculation mounts. Mavericks CEO Rick Welts confirmed last month that officials floated several possible locations and said the team is assessing two of them, though he cautioned that \u201cneither may work.\u201d Sources have suggested possibilities ranging from land near the planned convention center downtown to the former Valley View mall site in North Dallas. The county-owned jail land has also been floated, though officials say no talks have occurred.\nWelts, who previously oversaw the development of the $1.4 billion Chase Center in San Francisco during his time with the\nGolden State Warriors\n, said the\nMavericks\nare leaning toward a basketball-only facility. Hiring Welts to lead the organization last year might also provide fuel to the idea of anchoring a new stadium to a\ncasino\n.\nThe hunt for a site is only half the battle \u2014 financing could prove far trickier. In San Antonio, where officials are mulling a $1.3 billion arena for the\nSpurs\n, the funding plan includes $311 million in tourism taxes and up to $489 million in city money, alongside $500 million from the team.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two decades ago, the\nFallon Company\ndeveloped a 20-unit condominium on Sackett Street in Brooklyn. Since then the Boston-based builder has finished more than $5 billion worth of projects, but not a single one in New York City.\nIt\u2019s not because CEO Michael Fallon, whose father\nJoseph Fallon\nfounded the company in 1993, has anything against New York City.\n\u201cNew York is such a fabulous place,\u201d he said, describing it as the social, cultural and business mecca of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s such a deep pool of opportunity.\u201d\nYet Fallon sees greener pastures for his firm in the Southeast, in particular Nashville and Charlotte, as well as his home market of Boston.\n\u201cWhy are we focused on the markets we\u2019re focused on? Scale and access to capital,\u201d the 36-year-old said in a Zoom interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFallon likes building in Nashville and Charlotte because of their good infrastructure, financial health, amenable stakeholders, business-friendly political climates and nice weather. Also, both have a National Football League franchise.\nMost of Fallon\u2019s $6 billion pipeline is in the Southeast. There, he doesn\u2019t have to worry that locals will elect political leaders eager to \u201cdecommoditize\u201d housing \u2014 a concept that popped up as Fallon researched\nZohran Mamdani\nin preparation for his\nTRD\ninterview.\nIn one campaign video, Mamdani says, \u201cIf we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the\nfull de-commodification of housing\n.\u201d\nTo the contrary, the only feasible strategy to end \u2014 or prevent \u2014 a housing crisis is to allow for-profit development at scale.\nFallon does that by building affordable units the traditional way, typically with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, partnerships with big insurers such as Mass Mutual and Prudential, and debt from major lenders including\nFortress Investment Group\n; Santander,\nBank OZK\n, Wells Fargo and Key Bank.\nThe first phase of his next\nNashville project\nwill be 100 percent affordable and have north of 300 units. In the second phase, 10 percent of the units will be income-restricted. The\n$3 billion project\n, of which Fallon is the master developer, is expected to break ground next year.\n\nFallon is also working with\nCharlotte\u2019s housing authority\non a mixed-use project with 975 residential units, 405,000 square feet of office, 36,000 square feet of retail and amenities, and a 180-key hotel. Phase one includes 329 units, 20 percent of which will be affordable.\nTo be sure, the Fallon Company\u2019s last New York project was long before the socialist Mamdani came along. It has steered clear because like most developers, it prefers to operate in markets where it knows the players and the regulatory, cultural and political environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about de-risking that whole spectrum of development as much as you can,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIn New York, it\u2019s very complex and challenging to build.\u201d\nHis company has been in Charlotte since 2016, Raleigh since 2018 and Nashville since 2019.\n\u201cNashville in particular is very focused on \u2018how do we make this a compelling investment opportunity for a company relocation?\u2019\u201d Fallon said. \u201cYou need the city to remove friction points, and that is what the city and state are really good at.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s capital city is pursuing smart growth and striving to be competitive with other Southeast markets in attracting development, the CEO said.\nNew York has become more\nhospitable\nto new housing since the city\u2019s vacancy rate was found to have sunk to a\nrecord low of 1.4 percent\nin 2023, but it still requires\nhigh wages\nand\nsubstantial affordability\nin large multifamily projects. The hotel workers union has effectively\nblocked nonunion hotels\n. Rezoning remains a\ncrapshoot\n, and\nhistoric districts\nand\nlocal opposition\nare major obstacles.\nDoing a big project in New York would mean navigating these pitfalls and competing with firms familiar with the ins and outs of the city; Fallon cited the Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nand Tishman Speyer\u2019s\nthe Spiral\nas among his favorite developments. He would also have to find investors to bet on that proposition.\n\u201cWe need to focus on markets where we have a competitive edge in product, in relationships, in policy,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cThat works for partners with very long-term capital.\u201d\n",

County fell 44 percent from a year ago to $86.7 million in asking volume, in what some in the industry are calling August\u2019s typical\nsummer cool down\n. Fourteen properties went into contract last week, which is four fewer than the comparable period in 2024, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe report is compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team and counts single-family homes and condominiums listed at $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nRoth called the week\u2019s performance a \u201csimple blip in the market,\u201d that is historically seen with the back-to-school period.\n\u201cAugust is traditionally our slowest month of the year and has, previous to this week, been performing above expectations, so we see no cause for alarm in regards to a decline in the market,\u201d Roth said.\nTopping last week\u2019s signed contracts was 130 South Cliffwood Avenue, which has a listing price just shy of $14 million.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\u2019 David Offer holds the listing on behalf of a family trust, according to property records.\n\nThe\nBrentwood\nresidence has seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms, coming in at nearly 6,300 square feet. The lot is more than 20,000 square feet sitting behind gates with hedges for further privacy. Built in 1925, the New England traditional-style home recently received some touch-ups that included oak floors and interior paint.\nAside from the main residence, there\u2019s a two-story guest house with a bedroom, kitchenette and two bathrooms. Outdoors has a pool and sprawling lawns.\nThe next priciest listing to go into contract last week was 1760 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills, which is listed for $13.5 million.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Robby Sutton and Rayni Williams are the listing agents. Property records show a family trust is selling the home.\nThe Trousdale Estates residence has five bedrooms and five bathrooms across nearly 5,000 square feet. It offers big views of Century City, Downtown Los Angeles, the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains.\nThe Mid-Century modern home was designed by Rex Lotery, the architect behind Elvis Presley\u2019s Trousdale Estates home.\n",

Additionally, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, is infusing $120 million in equity and taking a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, will continue to lead development and is kicking in $40 million.\nAccording to Alloy, the 730-foot tower is slated to be the world\u2019s tallest built to passive house standards, a design method aimed at cutting energy costs through extreme insulation. The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools (also passive house) at 489 State Street.\n\nOne Third Avenue will include 143 affordable housing units, with monthly rents starting at $1,023 per month. These apartments will be reserved for tenants earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income.\nResidential space will span the 11th through 60th floors, and the tower\u2019s podium will include 60,000 square feet of office space. Two buildings constructed in the 1800s on State Street and Schermerhorn Street will also be incorporated into the development, and house 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nDemolition work on the site began earlier this year, and the development team expects to begin construction in the fall.\nWhen finished, Alloy Block is expected to include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable. The electric tower at 505 State Street was completed in July 2024. The developers\nsecured\n$290 million to replace a $210 million construction loan in December.\n",

The firm wants to turn the low-rise shopping center into a mixed-use complex with nearly 500 units.\nRosenwach proposed a 412,000-square-foot complex that would be between eight and ten stories tall. The property would include 492 residential units, 25 percent of which would be affordable for those earning a maximum of 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe proposal also includes a significant retail component \u2014 62,000 square feet in all on the ground floor, including a 2,300-square-foot cafe and gallery \u2014 which would allow the tenants of LaGuardia Center to remain in place when the redevelopment is completed.

Because of previous work, however, Rosenwach expects to qualify for the lapsed 421a tax break, for which construction needs to be completed by the middle of June 2031 after the deadline was extended last year.\nRosenwach acquired the site in 1989 for an undisclosed price and operates out of the address.

        "content": "Catellus Development and Deca are looking to turn a petroleum refinery near Long Beach into a modern industrial hub with restaurants and retail.\nThe developers have proposed replacing 406 acres of oil-refining operations and another 228-acre refinery site into millions of square feet of industrial space with grocers, restaurants, sports facilities and greenways available to nearby residents, CoStar\nreported\n. If approved, it would be among the largest conversions of previously environmentally hazardous land in California history.\nLast year,\noil giant Phillips 66\ntapped Catellus and Deca to help redevelop its Los Angeles refinery operations which include the 406-acre site at 1660 West Anaheim Street in Wilmington and a 228-acre site at 1520 East Sepulveda Boulevard in Carson. Catellus and Deca have filed plans with the city of Los Angeles for its Five Points Union Specific Plan, which would require zoning changes before any shovels can hit dirt.\nAt the Wilmington site, the Anaheim Street land will be split into two portions: A commercial and recreation strip along Anaheim Street with grocery stores, cafes, sports courts and greenways, and a logistics area with warehouses to the south.\n\nThe Wilmington development would stretch across three parcels including the 410-acre refinery site, a 10-acre vacant lot north of Anaheim Street and a 20-acre propane and butane storage yard. Plans have yet to be announced for the Carson site, though it could be redeveloped for industrial logistics use. It could also face separate legal and logistical hurdles due to its location in the city of Carson.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Catellus has undertaken such a project.\nIn 2003, the Emeryville-based firm redeveloped the 200-acre former Pacific Refinery Company near San Francisco into a residential subdivision known as Victoria by the Bay. In order to do that, the company had to remove contaminants from the site, not unlike what it will have to do in Wilmington and Carson.\nMeanwhile, in Huntington Beach, Shopoff Realty is\nlooking to redevelop\nthe\nMagnolia Tank Farm\nwith housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
