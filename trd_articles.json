He bought the property for $1.5 million in 2015 and built the 17,600-square-foot home in 2019.\nAdams bought the 0.7-acre Manalapan property for $1.7 million in 2017, records show. He built the 14,800-square-foot mansion in 2021. It includes six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a theater, 250 feet of waterfront and a dock.\nHe first listed it in 2021 asking $34.9 million, Zillow shows.

The final sale price isn\u2019t available, but the property was listed for $21 million when it sold last month. It spans over 910 acres on multiple parcels, bringing the price to $23,073 per acre.\nBarry joined the Texas Rangers during the state\u2019s brief period as an independent republic and later served in the Confederacy during the Civil War. He lived at the fork of the Bosque and East Bosque Rivers until he died in 1906 and was buried in a family cemetery on the property.\nThe ranch also hosted veteran and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d author Chris Kyle, who competed in bronc riding during his time at Tarleton State University in nearby Stephenville, according to\nIcon Global\nlisting agent Don Bell.\nThe ranch is 10 minutes from Glen Rose, an hour and a half from Dallas and an hour each way to Fort Worth and Waco.\nAlmost 9,000 square feet of living space are spread among several residences on the property, including a 3,500-square-foot, four-bedroom main house. The property includes a manager\u2019s house, several stocked tanks and a shooting range.\nBarry\u2019s memoirs testify to excellent hunting on the property, but Bell also talked up the property\u2019s fenced pastures and \u201cfull-service, world-class\u201d roping arena. The listing was marketed first to members of the National Cutting Horse Association.\nPatton, an oil and gas investor, Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioner, University of Texas donor and part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is also the owner of a less accomplished but more famous horse named Metallic Cat, which starred in an episode of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d Patton reportedly bought Metallic Cat for $14 million and won the rights to have the horse featured in the show at a charity auction.\nBell has a \u201cYellowstone\u201d connection as well. He joined Icon Global after\nselling the historic Four Sixes ranch to show creator Taylor Sheridan\n.\n",

        "content": "A four-year battle over a proposed 5,000-seat concert venue near the Austin suburb of\nDripping Springs\nis ending with a plot twist: the land is changing hands, and the venue is dead.\nAn affiliated entity of the Austin-based conservation group the Shield-Ayres Foundation agreed to buy the property near Fitzhugh Road and Crumley Ranch Road, where California-based Blizexas planned to build the Rockingwall Ranch Event Center, a move that will almost certainly terminate one of the Hill Country\u2019s most contentious projects, KXAN\nreported\n.\nThe plan had been a lightning rod since it surfaced, largely because the site sits atop environmentally sensitive terrain within the Barton Creek watershed and over a portion of the\nEdwards Aquifer Recharge Zone\n.\nNeighbors and environmental advocates warned that the amphitheater\u2019s wastewater and runoff could threaten the watershed, while sound, lighting and traffic from thousands of concertgoers would overwhelm the rural corridor.\nBlizexas sought a state permit to irrigate up to 12,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater on the site \u2014 a proposal that galvanized opposition.\nFor residents like Carrie Napiorkowski, whose driveway faces the property, the idea was almost unthinkable. The venue became a symbol of the\nHill Country\u2019s\nbroader fight over growth and land use as development pressure intensified west of Austin.\nShield Ranch, a long-standing conservation group and large landowner in the\nregion\n, emerged early as an opponent.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been actively opposed to this venue since the get-go,\u201d said Marshall Ayres Bowen, the group\u2019s vice president and general counsel. Bowen stressed the organization isn\u2019t anti-development but viewed the amphitheater as a severe mismatch for the area\u2019s ecological and community needs.\nThis week, Fitzhugh Ridge \u2014 a Shield Ranch-owned entity \u2014 announced a contract to purchase the land from Blizexas. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and the sale is expected to close in January. Blizexas didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nBowen framed the deal as the outcome of a broad, measured community effort rather than a reflexive NIMBY campaign. Residents met, organized and pressed regulators for years, presenting environmental concerns that ultimately shaped the alternative outcome.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just, \u2018We don\u2019t want this because we don\u2019t like it,\u2019\u201d Bowen told the outlet. \u201cIt was, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this\u2026 why we don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u2019\u201d\nWhat comes next for the land is unclear, but Bowen was definitive that a concert venue will not be built on that particular property. Napiorkowski said the announcement brought palpable relief.\n\u201cI really did believe David could beat the Goliath if you have enough people behind you,\u201d she said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is part of the Viterbi School of Engineering.\nIt was erected to \u201cfacilitate USC\u2019s artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced computing programs,\u201d per the suit filed in California Superior Court on Tuesday.\nThe HOK-designed building, which replaced a parking lot, marks USC\u2019s first LEED Platinum-certified structure. It includes a two-story lab for researching and testing autonomous aerial vehicles, open-plan robotics labs, student collaboration spaces and creativity zones, plus a 300-seat auditorium and amphitheater.\nAt a\nribbon-cutting ceremony\nin September 2024, then-USC President Carol Folt called the new building, \u201ca revolutionary space.\u201d She also touted to the media that the project took \u201cmore than 500,000 hours of labor, 12 million pounds of concrete and 145,000 bricks.\u201d\nIt is a \u201ccenterpiece in Folt\u2019s Frontiers of Computing \u2018moonshot,\u2019 a more than $1 billion initiative that supports ethical advancement in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced computing,\u201d the school said in a news release following the ceremony.\nYannis Yortsos, dean of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, said Ginsburg Hall was envisioned as the final piece of a campus trio with the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience and the Ray Irani Hall for Molecular and Computational Biology \u2014 a cluster meant to fuel work on everything from cancer to climate change.\nTurner signed a construction contract with the school on Nov. 17, 2020, making Turner the prime contractor for the project. The project was completed by this June.\nUSC is \u201crefusing to honor their contractual and legal obligations to compensate Turner and the trade contractors for their work,\u201d the suit says.

UTA has operated out of the DivcoWest-owned building at 9336-9346 Civic Center Drive since 2011;\nDivcoWest bought the building in 2018\nfrom the Rockefeller Group for $236 million. UTA shares the building with entertainment giant Live Nation, which also has its headquarters at UTA Plaza.\nUTA joins Artists First, another talent agency, in committing to office space Los Angeles as Hollywood studios have had leasing issues since the outbreak of the pandemic. Artists First signed a lease for nearly 23,000 square feet at Irvine Company\u2019s building at 2121 Avenue of the Stars in Century City. In 2023, Verve Talent Agency signed a 53,000-square-foot lease at Lincoln Property Company\u2019s BA/SE campus in Hollywood.\nIn August, Hackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital\nlocked down a $165 million refinancing loan\nfor the 315,000-square-foot Raleigh Studios campus on Melrose Avenue. Earlier this year, Hackman earned approval from the Los Angeles City Council for its $1 billion redevelopment endeavor at Television City; the firm is currently embroiled in a legal spat with Rick Caruso, who owns The Grove mall across the street, over the City Council\u2019s purported violation of environmental law in allowing the project to proceed.\nOn-location filming in Los Angeles has been on a decline since last year.

        "content": "The red-hot market for southwest Michigan luxury homes isn\u2019t slowing down.\nAs lakefront\nproperties in New Buffalo\nare getting slim, demand is moving northeast to Union Pier. A lavish contemporary house on Lake Michigan hit the market Friday asking nearly $9 million in Union Pier, which would set a record for the city if it sells at that price. On the same day, a nearby lakefront home closed for $5.1 million, well over its $4.6 million asking price and the highest sale price in Union Pier this year.\nThe activity underscores the success of the high-end second home market in Harbor Country, and elsewhere on Chicagoland waterfronts, where tight inventory is driving home prices up. In New Buffalo, two homes\nworth $7 million\n, and another at\n$9 million\n, went under contract in a matter of days this fall.\nPeggy Sayre, the listing agent for 15800 Lakeshore Road, the Union Pier home that sold for $5.1 million, said she set an ambitious price because of those recent New Buffalo sales. Sayre, part of the Dawn McKenna Group at Coldwell Banker Realty, listed the property alongside Mara Walsh.\n\u201cThey were selling like hotcakes,\u201d she said of the New Buffalo homes. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018All those people are going to come to ours next.\u2019 We went a little more aggressively with the price point and it really worked.\u201d\nSayre and Walsh got four offers over asking, and were able to close the deal quickly, going under contract five days after it hit the market on Oct. 31. The sale of the 3,000-square-foot home comes out to about $1,659 per square foot.\nThe property features a four-bedroom, three bathroom main house and a two-bedroom, one-bath coach house. The main Cape Cod-style house was built in 1992. The house has six beds and four bathrooms. It has 150 feet of private beach frontage.\nThe flurry of activity for luxury property in Harbor Country is unique for the usually sleepy month of November, Sayre said.\n\u201cIn all of the price points that I have listings on, I\u2019m getting multiple offers even on properties that have been sitting awhile,\u201d she said.\nThe home was recently renovated, which was a selling point for the buyers, said the buyer\u2019s agent Rob Gow of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago. \u201cIt was just a really beautiful renovation of a home,\u201d he said.\nThe house was owned by a trust under the name Joshua Hanna, and it was last purchased in 2018 for $2.3 million.\nJust down the road, the house at 15930 Lake Avenue in Union Pier is taking another shot at selling in the new buzzy market. The home was listed between June and October 2024 asking $7 million before being taken off the market. It went back on the market Friday asking $9 million.\nThe 4,510-square-foot Lake Avenue home has a circular design with floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows that look over Lake Michigan. The house has five beds and seven bathrooms, along with a detached guest house.\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\u2019s Liz Roch is the listing agent. Roch, who also listed the three homes in New Buffalo that went under contract recently, did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe home sits on nearly an acre and has 132 feet of private lake frontage, along with an in-ground pool and a tennis court.\nThe current owner bought the house in 2019 for $2.2 million.

        "content": "A California investor scooped up one of the\nGold Coast\u2019s\nmarquee apartment towers, closing a nine-figure deal that underscores the strength of Chicago\u2019s rental market and the painful price resets still rippling through the city\u2019s investment landscape.\nSan Francisco-based Friedkin Property Group paid $130 million for the 26-story, 304-unit One East Delaware, according to Cook County records \u2014 one of downtown\u2019s priciest multifamily trades of the year, yet still a steep markdown from the sellers\u2019 basis, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe building at 1 East Delaware Place, was sold by a venture of\nGolub &amp; Co. and Alcion Ventures\n, which bought it for $146 million in 2016 and later poured another $30 million into renovations. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman brokered the transaction.\nAt roughly $428,000 per unit, the sale trails only the\nFulbrix\ndeal in Fulton Market and the Left Bank in the West Loop among 2025\u2019s top multifamily trades. The 233,115-square-foot building sold for about $558 per square foot.\nThe building also offers 37,000-square-feet of\nretail space\nthat is 87 percent leased.\nBut the pricing also highlights how far values have fallen for older downtown towers as large transactions are difficult to pencil amid high interest rates.\nThe Golub-Alcion venture refinanced the property in late 2021 with a $113.5 million loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2024. Whether the lenders provided an extension was unclear, but the clock was ticking.\nIt\u2019s not the first Golub-related asset to take a hit. Chestnut Place, across the street from One East Delaware and recapitalized last year by another Golub venture, traded at roughly 20 percent below its 2017 price. That 280-unit building sold for $85.2 million, or about $304,000 per unit \u2014 another marker of the reset underway in the\nGold Coast\n.\nGolub\npublicly brushed off the broader market turbulence when it brought One East Delaware to market in May, calling it a \u201chigh-performing asset\u201d in a prime neighborhood.\nThe fundamentals back that up: the 1989-built tower was 95 percent occupied at listing, with studio, one- and two-bedroom units averaging nearly $3,000 a month, or $3.90 per square foot, according to CoStar. With only one major downtown apartment building delivered this year,\nrents climbed\nmore than 8 percent year over year in the third quarter, Integra data shows.\nFor Friedkin, the deal adds a rare downtown stake to a Chicago-area portfolio otherwise concentrated in the suburbs, including Naperville, Evanston, Elk Grove Village and Aurora.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Plan Commission plowed through a backlog of long-awaited proposals Thursday, advancing a slate of projects that could reshape pockets of the city from\nLincoln Park\nto the\nFar South Side\n.\nThe approvals don\u2019t guarantee shovels in the ground, but they clear the first major hurdle for developers angling to move forward after years of community debate, shifting market conditions and pandemic delays, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nDePaul\nUniversity\u2019s $42 million basketball practice facility was among the headline items.\nThe school won initial approval to build the four-story training hub at 2300\u20132316 North Sheffield Avenue, replacing a row of historic three-flats in the Sheffield National Historic District.\nThe project, first floated in 2022, drew opposition from preservationists and neighborhood groups who argued the demolitions would chip away at a streetscape that\u2019s stood since the 1890s. The Sheffield Neighborhood Association said the plan represented \u201ca continuation of the deterioration of the historic street wall,\u201d even as it emphasized its long-standing partnership with the university.\nPreservation Chicago\nalso lined up against the proposal, noting that two of the structures DePaul plans to raze are orange-rated \u2014 indicating potentially significant architectural features.\nBut university leaders pointed to support from other community organizations and stressed the need to upgrade facilities to stay competitive. Architect Joseph Antunovich told commissioners DePaul has \u201cfallen behind\u201d its peers. To soften the blow of demolitions, the school agreed to back landmark status for Cortelyou Commons and Byrne Hall, two of the oldest buildings on campus.\nOn the Far South Side, commissioners granted first approvals for\nMorgan Park Commons\n, a redevelopment of the long-vacant former Jewel grocery site and adjacent Halsted Indoor Mall.\nThe 12-acre corner at 115th and Halsted streets has sat empty for roughly 15 years, but Far South Community Development Corporation and its partners have been working since 2018 to revive it with housing, retail, open space and cultural programming. The city, which owns half the land after acquiring it from Albertsons, plans to transfer its stake to the nonprofit developer.\nPhase one calls for a $65 million investment across two buildings totaling 70 apartments \u2014 including studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms \u2014 as well as live/work units.\nInfrastructure work will remake local streets, creating South Peoria Street and West 114th Place. Preservation of Affordable Housing is slated to co-develop the first residential phase, with construction targeted for next year.\nPlanning commissioner Ciere Boatright called the effort \u201ca long time coming\u201d for a corridor that hasn\u2019t seen a mixed-use residential project in more than half a century.\nOn the North Side in\nEdgewater\n, a five-story condo building at 6150 North Sheridan Road also secured approval. The 40-unit structure, slated to replace the former Kindred Hospital parking lot, will feature underground parking, a roof deck and private outdoor space for ground-floor units. Developer Vladimir Zeleni expects the $15 million project could be delivered by mid-2027, pending City Council sign-off.\nThe commission approved two more towers in the development hotspot Fulton Market.\nProjects at 1200 West Carroll Avenue and 214 North Morgan Street will bring a combined 665 apartments to the booming district. The Carroll Avenue building will also carve out green space programmed for craft markets and outdoor movie nights \u2014 a rare amenity in one of the densest pockets of the Near West Side.\nAnd in\nNorth Lawndale\n, commissioners advanced plans for the $38 million One Lawndale Recreation Center, replacing a vacant former CTA storage lot at Springfield Avenue and Cermak Road.\nThe proposed multisport complex would house two indoor turf fields, five basketball courts, boxing and wrestling rooms, a multipurpose space, concessions and a pro shop. The center is projected to host roughly 250,000 visits annually and could start construction next year, with completion slated for fall 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A number of notable landlords and developers found themselves in trouble in New York this week.\nSteve Croman is combating\nmore than 28 active foreclosure lawsuits\ntargeting properties he controls. In total, lenders allege Croman\u2019s entities defaulted on more than $231 million in loan principals.\nTwenty-one of the foreclosure suits were filed in the last week, many zby lender Orange Owner LLC. The principal of those associated loans totals more than $189 million\nIn a court filing, Croman denied many of the allegations.\nBut it\u2019s just the latest issue for the man once dubbed the city\u2019s worst landlord, who served an eight-month stint for mortgage and tax fraud and was sued over the summer by his own father.\nCroman\u2019s not the only real estate figure involved in a difficult family affair. The Ostad brothers,\na trio of New York real estate investors\n, were named as\ndefendants\nin nine foreclosure suits related to loans totaling more than $70 million.\nThe brothers stopped making payments on the loans in April, according to the plaintiff. That\u2019s the same month that\nMichael and Edward sued Steven\n, hoping to dissolve their family partnerships; Steven is only named in three of the cases, while his brothers are named in all of them.\nThe older Ostad brothers lead fix-and-flip lender Flatiron Realty Capital. Steven is the founder of residential brokerage Empire City Realty and lender Real Quick Capital, though both appear to be closed.\nNo stranger to his only family drama, Alex Sapir is in the midst of the messy process to wind down his business.\nSapir Corp\nplaced\nits Nomo Soho hotel into Chapter 11, the latest development in the ongoing collapse and liquidation of the Israeli-backed real estate company.\nThe firm is seeking to run a court-supervised auction for the 26-story boutique hotel at 9 Crosby Street. Its petition is designed to cement a sale and pay down Sapir Corp\u2019s $155 million in bond debt across two Israeli bond series.\nThe bankruptcy filing comes three weeks after Sapir\nentered insolvency proceedings\nin Israel, where the company told the Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court it could no longer meet bond payments or cover operating costs. All of its directors resigned and a trustee is overseeing the company as it winds down.\nElsewhere in the city, Manhattan\u2019s favorite contested sculpture garden was back in the news this week, courtesy of a feud between the outgoing and incoming mayors.\nThe would-be developers of the Haven Green affordable housing complex at the Elizabeth Street Garden\nsued\nthe city, claiming the mayor illegally dedicated the site as a city park.\nPennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester, who were chosen in 2017 to build 123 senior housing units on the city-owned site, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday.\nThey want the court to annul the parkland designation.\nAhead of the November election, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nindicated\nthat he would move forward with Haven Green and evict the garden. After the Adams administration declared the land a park, Mamdani told reporters that pursuing the project would be \u201c\nnearly impossible\n,\u201d as using city parkland for other uses would require action by the state legislature.\nPerhaps the lawsuit makes it a little less impossible.\nFinally, when the city began its search for developers of a site in the Meatpacking District, the request for proposals encouraged \u2014 but did not mandate \u2014 the\ninclusion\nof an \u201cemerging developer.\u201d\nThe RFP described a candidate that had completed fewer than 10 projects in the past decade, each with fewer than 150 residential units, no more than 100,000 square feet and a cost below $30 million. Simple enough.\nSo the EDC\nselected\nKinwood Partners \u2014 alongside Douglaston Development \u2014 to build 590 housing units on a city-owned site.\nKinwood hasn\u2019t developed anything, so all good, right?\nWell, it\u2019s led by someone \u2014 David Himmel \u2014 who spent a decade working for a major real estate firm as well as on projects in the neighborhood. Himmel is the former chief operating officer at Jamestown and son of Leslie Wohlman Himmel, co-founder of investment firm Himmel &amp; Meringoff Properties.\nNaturally, the firm\u2019s selection raised questions about the intent of designations like \u201cemerging developer\u201d in public-private endeavors.\n",

        "content": "Some of the biggest names in residential real estate traded the boardroom for a drab Manhattan courtroom this week.\nThe four-day hearing kicked off on Tuesday with testimony from Compass CEO Robert Reffkin on his firm\u2019s lawsuit against Zillow\u2019s rules barring agents from listing homes on the platform that were publicly marketed outside of the MLS.\nCompass\nsued the aggregator\nin June, seeking to block what it deemed \u201canticompetitive\u201d policies enacted after the firm rolled out a new marketing strategy, which begins with sellers listing their homes on Compass\u2019 private exclusive listing network.\nJoining Reffkin\nin the courtroom\nwere some of his top New York City agents, including the company\u2019s chief evangelist, Leonard Steinberg, leader of the Litvak Team, Eugene Litvak and Heather Domi, who co-founded the New York Residential Agent Continuum.\nReffkin and his attorneys echoed arguments laid out in court filings, including that Zillow\u2019s updated rules, dubbed the Zillow Ban, were adopted specifically \u201cto quash the threat posted by Compass,\u201d the firm\u2019s lawyer, Kenneth Dintzer, said in court.\nThe following day, Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman, in from the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle,\ntook the stand\n, where he pushed back against the notion that Zillow implemented its listing rules to target Compass alone. He also rebuffed Dintzer\u2019s attempts to cast Compass as one of Zillow\u2019s direct competitors.\nIf you ask the two firms involved, the fight unfolding in court isn\u2019t just a clash of corporate egos. It\u2019s also about the future of how residential agents conduct their business and who gets a hand in the process. (Though what it\u2019s really about is the potential millions of dollars either company could forfeit if the other gets its way.)\nManhattan is a fitting venue for the two companies to duke it out. It\u2019s not just that Compass is headquartered here, but if Reffkin prevails, he\u2019ll also be expanding a home marketing system that already exists, to a certain degree, in New York City and other luxury markets.\nThe city runs on deals inked off public listing platforms. Earlier this month, a mansion in Gravesend, Brooklyn,\nsold for $32 million, setting a borough record\nwithout ever hitting the open market.\nAt new developments, developers often start signing contracts for units before any listings ever make it to StreetEasy or Zillow. Take Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital\u2019s 80 Clarkson. Rumor has it that a significant share of its condos have\nalready found buyers\n, yet the sales team hasn\u2019t posted a single listing.\nRelying on well-connected agents who facilitate trades for high-profile or high-net-worth clients behind closed doors, the city\u2019s market thrives on relationships and access, and having the right dose of both is how agents prove their value. Reffkin\u2019s vision mirrors this environment: agents working with Compass, soon to be the largest brokerage by far, have access to the most inventory, which they can (and likely already are) leveraging to bring more buyers their way.\nDespite the prevalence of off-market deals in the city, most sales are still the result of properties hitting the open market, and it\u2019s likely that will remain the case. Even Compass\u2019 own data shows that most homes marketed as private exclusives ultimately end up on MLSs, and therefore, aggregators like Zillow.\nNot so fast\u2026\nA New York City-based proptech startup just snagged a fresh venture capital infusion.\nTulu, which allows tenants to rent items such as vacuum cleaners, virtual reality headsets and Play Stations through an artificial intelligence-powered app, closed its Series A funding round with $37 million in investments, including $17 million from GreenSoil PropTech Ventures, Bosch Ventures and New Era Capital Partners.\nThe fresh round of financing for the startup \u2014 which counts among its clients major landlords in the city such as Related, Brookfield and RXR \u2014 comes after venture capitalists\nlargely shied away from\ninvesting in proptech startups.\nFunding for proptechs hit all-time highs in 2021, when investors pumped\nroughly $9.5 billion\ninto the sector to back ventures such as residential agent back-end service, Place, and data platform, CompStak.\nBut the rush of capital proved to be overkill. Several once-promising startups were failing or showing major signs of collapse, scaring off venture capitalists looking to throw their weight behind a rising industry. In the first half of 2024, funding for proptechs fell more than 14 percent compared to the same period in 2023, according to data from the Center for Real Estate Technology and Innovation.\nBut earlier this year, Brendan Wallace, CEO and CIO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\ntide could be turning\n. He may have cited his own company\u2019s moves as proof \u2014 including CBRE\u2019s acquisition of Industrious, a company Wallace backs, in a deal valued at $800 million \u2014 but he was firm in his prediction of a \u201cmomentum shift.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to hit city records last week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street. Unit 42E, which has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, sold for just under $45 million to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an LLC known as Pipedream 66.\n",

        "content": "New York University\u2019s Furman Center held a panel Wednesday morning on the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock.\nAt one point, Samuel Stein, a senior policy analyst at Community Service Society, made a somewhat radical suggestion: Given the distress in rent-stabilized buildings, if landlords don\u2019t take part in well-designed city programs meant to help them, maybe someone else should take over.\nThen, suddenly, the lights went out.\n\u201cThe specter of government ownership!\u201d Stein joked.\nIt\u2019s an interesting time for rent-stabilized housing. Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful mayoral campaign has contributed to a sense of left-wing momentum, all while distress in the sector is growing and buildings are selling for a fraction of their peak prices. Could those conditions give rise to a government or nonprofit takeover of buildings?\nSome progressives think so. Mamdani has\ncooled his anti-landlord rhetoric\nrecently, but the advocates who may have his ear still have bold ideas about the future of New York\u2019s housing stock.\nStein acknowledges that distress in rent-stabilized buildings is a real problem. Government programs can provide relief, he said, but not if they are poorly designed, like the city\u2019s Unlocking Doors program. (Gothamist reported that\nnot one landlord\nhas participated in the program.)\nHowever, even when programs are well-designed, many landlords may just not want to work with the government, Stein contends. Or they may be more focused on ways to achieve higher rents, which increases property values.\nAnd if landlords aren\u2019t interested in what the city\u2019s offering, maybe it\u2019s time for tenants, community land trusts or the city itself to take over, he said.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not interested in doing the right thing, that\u2019s when we move to alternative ownership,\u201d Stein said in an interview.\nCea Weaver, who directs Housing Justice for All, has a similar vision. Writing for\nPhenomenal World\na few weeks ago, Weaver imagines the city could purchase buildings, now at fire sale prices, from owners who want to sell. It could then lease out the ability to collect rents and, with a vast enough portfolio, cross-subsidize between higher- and lower-income buildings.\nSetting aside ideological objections, experts and advocates I\u2019ve chatted with had some concerns with these plans. They would be expensive, for one, not to mention the city is bad at stewarding things, they said. Plus, a change in ownership would not inherently fix the issue of economic distress in these buildings. Revenue (i.e., rent) would still have to go up.\nStein accepts this last point, but says there are other benefits to these models, like greater trust and more democratic control of tenants\u2019 living conditions.\nStill, despite the ascendance of the city\u2019s left wing, many politicians wouldn\u2019t be on board for this level of intervention.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any need for some fundamental change in the ownership structure of these buildings,\u201d said State Sen. Brian Kavanagh when I asked him about Stein\u2019s ideas.\nBut some are taking small steps in that direction. A City Council committee is considering the bill COPA, which, as written, would delay building sales by several months to allow nonprofit organizations a first opportunity to purchase.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement, there\u2019s a lot of organizing,\u201d Stein said of this political moment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hair-pulling among the landlord class.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThree state senate committees are running an investigation into why residential insurance costs have skyrocketed. Do you have thoughts about why premiums are up? Have soaring insurance costs wrecked your finances? Drop me a line at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe average household income among renters in Veris Realty\u2019s properties is $480,000, as Jay Parsons spotted and\nposted to X/Twitter\nthis morning.\nElsewhere:\n\u2013 Mamdani met President Trump at the Oval Office today. The two struck a positive tone. \u201cI feel very confident that he can do a very good job,\u201d Trump said of Mamdani, adding that the two agree on more than he thought.\n\u2013 Nydia Velazquez, the 16-term, 72-year-old state representative, said she will not run for reelection in 2026. That opens up a seat in New York\u2019s seventh congressional district, which runs through many Mamdani strongholds, including Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Bushwick, Ridgewood, Long Island City and the mayor-elect\u2019s own Astoria.\n\u2013 One man singlehandedly delayed 755 subway trains in October by pulling copper wiring off the tracks at 149th Street-Grand Concourse,\nGothamist\nreported.\nClosing time:\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$21 million\nfor 111 West 57th Street, Unit 58. The Midtown Central condo is 4,200 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nNikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18.03 million\nfor 212 Lafayette Street. The rental unit in Soho is five stories, has 16 units and is 8,800 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $26.9 million for 133 East 73rd Street, Unit PH. The Lenox Hill condo is 6,700 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "President Donald Trump joins the list of New York City developers who see common ground with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani when it comes to housing.\nTrump said on Friday that he was surprised by how much he agreed with the democratic socialist, especially when it came to issues of affordability.\n\u201cHe wants to see no crime, he wants to see housing being built, he wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,\u201d Trump told reporters\nduring a joint media briefing\non Friday.\nMamdani met with Trump in Washington, D.C., on Friday, and then the two fielded questions from reporters in the Oval Office.\nIt seems Mamdani was able to tap into an issue core to Trump\u2019s personality: New York City development. The president said one of the things he gleaned from their meeting was that Mamdani agreed that the way to drive down rents is to build more housing. The president said this hadn\u2019t been clear to him, based on media reports. He was presumably referring to Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. The mayor-elect has also said he wants to build 200,000 apartments in the next decade.\n\u201cHe\u2019d like to see them come down, ideally, by building a lot of additional housing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate way. He agrees with that, and so do I.\u201d\nThe two would presumably not see eye to eye on zoning reform. The Trump administration rolled back Obama-era rules that required local governments that receive federal funds to address discriminatory housing policies, including zoning rules that have reinforced segregation. He has also\ndecried\nforcing suburbs to welcome low-income housing into their neighborhoods.\nMamdani said the two also discussed the need for housing regulations to be manageable and not further delay construction. When asked about comments he made about wanting to raise taxes on \u201cricher, whiter neighborhoods,\u201d Mamdani pushed back on the reporter\u2019s characterization of the phrase as \u201crace-based property taxes,\u201d saying that this was referring to the makeup of neighborhoods, not an expression of intent.\n\u201cWe intend to create a fair property tax system because we want a New York City that is not only fair and equitable, but also one that every New Yorker can afford,\u201d the mayor-elect said.\nThe two displayed a surprising amount of warmth toward each other, given that Trump has referred to Mamdani as a \u201c\ncommunist lunatic\n\u201d and stoked fears that he would deploy National Guard officers in the city. Mamdani has also not been shy about criticizing the president. During his\nvictory speech\nthis month, Mamdani addressed Trump directly and said the city could show the rest of the nation how to defeat him.\nBut Trump said he wants to help New York City and said he would feel comfortable living under a Mamdani administration.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI expect to be helping him, not hurting him.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A pair of neighboring waterfront properties spanning more than 13 acres set a new record for the tony Connecticut enclave of Westport.\nTogether, the Beachside Avenue plots sold for $45 million, according to listing agent Leslie Clarke of Compass. The sellers, former commodity trader Andrew Bentley and his wife Fiona Garland, built the sprawling waterfront home on 120-122 Beachside Avenue and commissioned a 75-foot pool on the neighboring property, along with a contemporary barn.\nOne of the properties was previously owned by TV personality Phil Donahue and his wife, actress Marlo Thomas, which Bentley and Garland bought for $20 million in 2013. They purchased the other for another $20 million in 2010, according to property records.\nAnother of the famous couple\u2019s former properties, at 114 Beachside Avenue,\nheld the previous price record for the area\nwhen it sold for $25 million in 2006.\nSpanning over 11,000 square feet and sitting on over six acres, the mansion at 120-122 Beachside Avenue originally hit the market alone in 2020,\nasking $28 million\n. After popping on and off the market over the next several years, it returned at the start of this year asking $25 million.\nThe home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and a four-car garage.\nClarke said that combining the properties presented a \u201cunique opportunity for the buyer to have almost 14 acres that couldn\u2019t have happened anywhere else.\u201d\nBentley and Garland appear to be trying to liquidate their holdings on the exclusive stretch of road running along the Long Island Sound. The pair also listed the former properties of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein for\n$21 million in 2023\n.\nThose properties, at 26 and 28 Beachside Avenue, sold for over $17 million combined in separate but related transactions, according to Clarke. Bentley and Garland bought them for $16 million in 2018.\n",

        "content": "The Creedmoor Psychiatric Center is one step closer to a massive housing redevelopment, a project that will leave housing advocates wondering if more could\u2019ve been constructed.\nThe state\u2019s Public Authorities Control Board approved the administration\u2019s redevelopment plans for a 58-acre portion of the Queens Village campus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Construction is expected to start in 2027 and wrap in 2029, though a developer still needs to be selected for the site.\nUnder the plan, a mix of 2,000 affordable and market-rate rental and purchasable units will be developed on the long-vacant site. There will be senior, veteran and supportive housing options.\nThe development will also include more than 10 acres of open space, retail and community space, expected to include a public school, a childcare facility and space for seniors.\nThe administration will pull funds from a $500 million pot earmarked for housing developments on state-owned land. That is not expected to cover the entirety of the project.\nThe master plan for Creedmoor, released in December 2023, called for\nmore than 2,800 homes\n. But density concerns led to negotiations between Empire State Development and local officials, resulting in a compromise that cut roughly 850 units from the proposal.\nFive of the planned eight-story buildings were also axed from the proposal. The agreement,\nrevealed\nin August, created a 27 percent decrease in overall unit square footage and a 15 percent reduction in units allocated for individuals with mental illnesses.\nCreedmoor has been around since 1912, when it opened as a satellite facility of Brooklyn State Hospital. It began as a psychiatric \u201cfarm colony\u201d where patients took part in daily work as part of a therapy regimen.\nThe full campus spans 125 acres. Most of its buildings \u2014 19 out of 25 \u2014 are vacant. Multiple state-led agencies are expected to continue providing services to patients on the remaining 67 acres at Creedmoor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Morgan Chase\nbranch in\nMountain View\nblew up at a tense city council meeting this week.\nThe South Carolina-based developer threatened to sue the City of Mountain View moments before officials voted on its $350 million plan calling for 299 apartments, ground-floor retail and a rebuilt Chase branch at 749 West El Camino Real, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAt the center of the debate was Greystar\u2019s request to stretch its construction timeline from two years to eight, as well as other requests for financial credits for the project\u2019s public benefits and to build a permanent loading zone along Victor Way.\nThe timeline extension was the biggest sticking point; officials approved the project plan and more than $1 million in credit toward community benefits and asked that the company work with city staff to designate a loading zone on Victor Way. But it denied the request for the eight-year timeline.\nGreystar has worked five years on the project, and its attorney accused the city of \u201ca lot of negative intent,\u201d\n\u201cWhen the market and interest rates are funky, you just can\u2019t finance a $350-million project on the drop of a hat, especially with an artificial deadline in front of you,\u201d Tamsen Plume, an attorney for the developer, said at the meeting.\nGreystar had asked for an extension several times prior Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but the City turned down each one. City officials said Greystar didn\u2019t provide evidence that extending the timeline by six years would cut down on the costs of building\naffordable apartments\n, instead saying it would actually increase costs.\n\u201cIt took us four years as an applicant to get the project approved, and then you\u2019re going to hold us to two years to break ground,\u201d Dan Diebel, a representative for Greystar, said at the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable. All we\u2019re asking is for the city to be reasonable.\u201d\nThe council also echoed staff concerns that the extension amounted to land banking, a practice that has earned a derided reputation in cities desperate for near-term housing production. The City of Mountain View must\nplan\nfor 11,135 new housing units by 2031 as part of its state-mandated housing goals.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Tishman Speyer handles leasing at the property.\nNvidia\u2019s plans for the site are not yet known. Its relatively small size and proximity to the headquarters of artificial intelligence companies like\nOpenAI\n, Anthropic and Sierra implies it could be a sales office or events space rather than a home for engineering and research and development operations.\nSierra signed the largest office lease of the year in San Francisco a few blocks away at 185 Berry Street in China Basin, rivaling OpenAI\u2019s 315,000-square-foot\nexpansion in Mission Bay last year\n.\nNvidia\u2019s San Francisco lease comes after the tech giant shared better-than-expected profits in its third-quarter earnings report as its valuation grew past $5 billion.\nIts third-quarter profits were $31.9 billion, up 65 percent from the third quarter of last year and 245 percent from the third quarter of 2023. The company controls about 90 percent of the market for chips used to power AI technology.\nThe Golden State Warriors and Coinbase also have leases at Mission Rock\u2019s Building B, which has 30,000 square feet left to fill.\nMission Bay\u2019s vacancy rate is 9.1 percent, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield. San Francisco\u2019s citywide vacancy rate, meanwhile, hovers around 33.6 percent.\nNvidia has dropped more than $1 billion on real estate in and\naround its headquarters in Santa Clara\nover the past two years of rapid growth.\nIt\nbought its 550,000-square-foot headquarters\noutright last year for $374 million.\nThe firm kicked off this year with the\npurchase of four 125,000-square-foot buildings\nfrom the Sobrato Organization for $254 million.\nIn May, it\npaid $123 million in cash\nfor a 10-building research and office campus, and in September, it\nbought a 125,000-square-foot building from Sobrato\nfor $83.2 million.\nThe company is reportedly shopping for more offices in south San Jose.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Meyers Accesso won a Boca Raton board\u2019s backing of its proposed 289,677-square-foot, mixed-use development.\nThe Boca Raton Planning &amp; Zoning Board voted 4 to 0 Thursday evening to endorse a request by Meyers Accesso affiliate BRI 1885 Atrium at Boca LP to approve two ordinances and three resolutions that pave the way for the development of an eight-story complex. It will have 222 apartments (including 23 affordable and 12 workforce housing units), 2,015 square feet of restaurants and retail and a four-level parking structure on what is now a parking lot for the office building called Atrium at Broken Sound at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway. The office building will remain.\nThe developer also is seeking to rezone from recreational to light industrial research park its 0.9-acre sliver of the 140.2-acre Old Course at Broken Sound. Michael Marshall, an attorney with Nelson Mullins who represents BRI 1885 Atrium, said his client does not intend to build on the golf course portion, is forbidden to do so by a restrictive covenant, and the request is just a \u201chousekeeping measure.\u201d (Most of The Old Course golf course is owned by Broken Sound Club, a private golf club.)\nArchitect Garcia Stromberg\u2019s design for the eight-story building shows a 12,945-square-foot amenity rooftop deck with a 2,200-square-foot pool. The development\u2019s apartments would consist of 39 three-bedrooms, 109 two-bedrooms, 73 one-bedrooms and an efficiency, according to a city memo.\nThe 10.5-acre property, which includes the Atrium at Broken Sound office building and a 2.43-acre portion of the golf course, was acquired by Meyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso Partners,\nfor $25 million in January 2024\n.\nAtrium at Broken Sound is within the Park at Broken Sound, a 700-acre residential and commercial planned development that has attracted investment and development in recent years. In June, the Boca Raton City Council approved plans for a seven-story,\n289-unit mixed-income apartment project\nat 900 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway that will include 44 workforce and affordable housing units, a barbeque area and a dog park. And in March, Oak Plane Partners proposed a\n243-unit Live Local Act project\nnext to its office headquarters at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard.\nFormed in 2022, the Meyers Accesso joint-venture recently proposed building an eight story,\n200-unit apartment development in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek area\ncalled Avery Cypress Creek. Meyers Accesso also\ncompleted a $46 million, 200-unit apartment community in Lake Worth Beach\n.\nMeyers Group was founded in 2015 by Stuart I. Meyers, who served as CEO and chairman until his death in June at the age of 83. Following Meyers\u2019 passing,\nAlan Losada\nwas named CEO. Meyers Group is negotiating to build a\n$192 million mixed-use commercial project near Disney\nin Kissimmee.\nFounded 21 years ago, Accesso Partners is led by managing partners Ariel Bentana, Moises Benzaquen, Claudio Dombey and Daniel Goldstein. According to its website, Accesso Partners has owned or managed $3.3 billion of commercial or residential development in multiple states.",

TMC president\nBill McKeon\nunveiled the plan at the system\u2019s annual State of the TMC event last week.\nConstruction is slated to start next year. McKeon kept quiet on development partners but said the project fills a glaring gap in the campus: space for people to stay, meet and network without shuttling across the city.\nThe three-pronged buildout would mark a major expansion of Helix Park, the Old Spanish Trail site that until recently was mostly parking lots.\nThe first phase opened in 2023, with the TMC3 Collaborative Building and\nBeacon Capital\u2019s\nDynamic One\ntower, creating a landing spot for commercial tenants hoping to plug into TMC\u2019s research pipeline.\nVenture capital firm Portal Innovations is already subleasing to startups there, and anchors like Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist and Rice\u2019s RBL have moved in.\nMcKeon signaled this next step months ago.\nTMC said last year that a hotel, conference center and multifamily residences were always part of the master plan, with the final unit count dependent on market demand and how the buildings stack up on the northern edge of the site.\nThe hotel and conference center are intended to serve everything from investor summits to scientific gatherings \u2014 events TMC has long hosted but lacked the infrastructure to keep on campus.\nThe project arrives as TMC pushes to make Helix Park a 24/7 district rather than a 9-to-5 research zone. Housing would give the campus its first wave of full-time residents and further blur the line between academic, clinical and commercial activity.\nFor a cluster that draws millions of visitors annually, lodging and meeting space have been conspicuously absent.\nMcKeon also rolled out a companion initiative: a $5.5 million overhaul of The Commons at 6550 Bertner Avenue.\nElkus Manfredi Architects\n\u2014 the Boston firm behind Helix Park\u2019s design \u2014 is planning to convert the concrete structure into a park centerpiece.

What are we?\u201d Glasser asked the audience in his pep rally-style address.\n\u201cHousing providers!\u201d the crowd chanted in unison.\nGlasser hadn\u2019t prepped them on what to say before his callout at the annual Lincoln Park Builder\u2019s Forum at the Theater on the Lake, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been working behind the scenes to get his message across.\nDemocratic Socialist Zohran\nMamdani won New York City\u2019s mayoral election\nthis month by positioning landlords as the enemy of affordability and Glasser said he fears that same image can be applied to Chicago\u2019s landlords.\n\u201cWe know that public perception counts,\u201d he said.\nGlasser\u2019s audience at the annual gathering of real estate players seemed energized by his speech. They cheered when he talked about thwarting Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s progressive agenda and laughed when he threw in double entendres for extra flair.\nIf New York\u2019s real estate industry is\nabout to begin its competition to win back political power\n, Chicago\u2019s is at halftime and feeling confident.\nGlasser, who was accepting the Lincoln Park Builders\u2019 2025 Impact Award, listed off recent accomplishments of his organization, the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance, which has become an active lobbying group.\nIt was instrumental in\na well-funded campaign\nto defeat Johnson\u2019s proposal to increase the city\u2019s real estate transfer tax and successfully swayed two aldermen to\nrevoke their support for a right of first refusal ordinance\nfor the Northwest Side\u2019s multifamily market.\nStill, fears remain over another\nright of first refusal rule proposed for South Shore\nand any possibility that rent control could gain traction at the state house.\nMeanwhile, more than\nhalfway through Johnson\u2019s term\n, his approval rating is faltering and\nrents are growing more quickly in Chicago\nthan pretty much anywhere else in the country \u2014 a trend the mayor campaigned on reversing. Part of that rent growth can be attributed to a\nsteep dropoff in new multifamily construction\n.\nBut who, or what, to blame that on is up for debate. Some have pointed to broader economic factors like interest rates and construction costs while others focus their attention locally, especially on\nChicago\u2019s complex property tax system\n.\nFollowing Glasser\u2019s speech, a forum with developer AMLI\u2019s CEO Gregory Mutz, former Illinois Senate President John Cullerton and former Chicago Alderman James Cappleman aimed to find answers.\nThe forum\u2019s moderator Belgravia Chairman Alan Lev dressed up as an English barrister complete with a powdered wig and judge\u2019s robe. He began the forum by asking the panelists to swear to tell the whole truth \u201cor a little bit of the truth.\u201d\nDown in Texas, Austin has been\nbuilding significantly more housing per year\nbecause, Mutz said, the city\u2019s affordable housing policies are less restrictive than\nChicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance\n. Chicago\u2019s rule, commonly referred to as the ARO, generally requires that multifamily developers seeking zoning changes or financial assistance from the city set aside 10 to 20 percent of their units as affordable to people making 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe result is that developers either choose not to build at all or justify higher market rate rents via amenities to offset the cost of the lower-rent units, Mutz said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got amenities out the wazoo. I mean, it\u2019s crazy what we\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re a poor person with a dog, Christ \u2026 these dog spas we\u2019re building are nuts,\u201d he said.\nCappleman, the former alderman whose soft-spoken cadence is likely a remnant of the time he previously spent as a Franciscan friar, chimed in.\n\u201cIf we look at all the affordable housing in the city of Chicago \u2014 I\u2019m talking about CHA housing, HUD housing, not-for-profit housing, and housing finance through Low Income Housing Tax Credits and ARO housing \u2014 how much of that do we get from the ARO? It is 1.8 percent. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe moderator, Lev, who had removed his wig by this point, cut in.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. How do we get our governmental officials to see that, understand that and change it, as opposed to just tweaking it and making it more onerous?\u201d he asked Cappleman.\nCappleman responded that the ARO is ineffective but changes to it would be a political landmine for aldermen who list landlords \u201cbelow drug dealers\u201d on their list of priorities. Instead, Cappleman said, the members of the audience should focus their messaging toward renters and push for policies that allow developers to build more naturally occurring affordable housing.\nThe strategy talk comes at a time when political power is up for grabs in Chicago. In 2026, Illinois will see\na major shakeup\namong its members of Congress with five seats set to be vacated. Among the candidates running for U.S. Senate is\nJason Friedman, son of Chicago real estate giant Al Friedman\n. (Any mention of the 18 years he spent as president of his father\u2019s development firm was left off his campaign website).\nWhile incumbent J.B. Pritzker is favored to win the governor\u2019s race, he is also a rumored candidate for president in 2028. And commercial real estate and video gambling company owner\nRick Heidner recently threw his hat in the gubernatorial ring\n.\nIn 2027, Mayor Johnson will be up for re-election and he\u2019s already drawn potential opponents. Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas\nannounced her run this week\nand several other candidates across local and state levels of government are rumored to be joining her.\nIn the meantime, Glasser ended his speech with two final requests for the audience.\n\u201cFor those of you who are interested, please come join us. For those of you who aren\u2019t interested, but you still benefit from what we do, think about that transfer tax that didn\u2019t happen and cut us a check,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "The Rexford takeover rumors seem to have traction.\nThe industrial real estate investment trust indicated as much a couple days ago, after market close, when it announced a chief executive shakeup and a changed capital allocation strategy.\nThe dual announcements came months after a report that Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management built an active stake in the company. Rexford more recently took the opportunity of an earnings call, to disclose that it had met with the relentless activist investor.\nRexford chief operating officer Laura Clark is now in line to succeed co-CEOs and co-founders Michael Frankel and Howard Schwimmer, the company announced. Chairman Tyler Rose, who recently replaced Richard Ziman, said the \u201ctransition is the culmination of the board\u2019s multi-year succession planning process.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to it, according to Newport Beach-based industry tracker and data analyst Green Street.\n\u201cIt appeared Ms. Clark was on the path to eventually succeed Co-CEOs Frankel and Schwimmer upon their retirement, but there is no question that Elliott\u2019s involvement sped up the timeline,\u201d a Green Street analysis read.\nFrankel and Schwimmer aren\u2019t only dropping their C-suite gigs, but their seats on the board of directors, too, which was characterized as a surprise in a recent BMO analysis.\nNonetheless, Frankel and Schwimmer have entered into a transition and separation agreement, each being granted a restricted stock award valued at $22.6 million. That\u2019s more than their $13 million total\ncompensation\nfor 2024.\nIn a separate announcement, Clark said the company would maximize returns by selling assets and reinvesting capital into high-yielding assets and share repurchases. During the latest\nearnings\n, the company said it had no planned purchases, only dispositions, a change from its buy-happy days.\nThe company said it would add a new independent director by the end of the year, too. Any guesses? Either way, shares of the $10 billion, typically vanilla-REIT, rose on the news.\nReversal behind Hudson Pac reverse split?\nIn other publicly traded, real estate investment trust news: Studio and office owner Hudson Pacific Properties announced a board-approved 1-for-7 reverse stock split that\u2019ll take effect Dec. 1.\nReverse stock splits consolidate the number of existing shares into fewer, higher-priced shares and are sometimes done to avoid being delisted \u2014 but the company\u2019s shares are trading under $2 per share, with the $1 mark a red flag for delisting. Still, the announcement comes after the Victor Coleman-helmed company\u2019s\nlosses\nballooned to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nSelling debt\nDistressed debt, anyone?\nEastdil is marketing\nan offering\nto purchase the mortgage loan connected to a Brookfield-owned office tower on Bunker Hill. The Downtown Los Angeles property, at 333 South Grand Avenue, includes a 54-story office building, called the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower, along with a three-story retail asset called the Halo.\n(A sister South Tower is not included in the deal).\nThe roughly $506 million debt on the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower is in default, but how much the note would fetch, if it trades, is unclear. Eastdil shared no hints in the offering memorandum, nor did it say whether it was representing Brookfield or its lenders.\nBut the loan connected to EY Plaza, another Brookfield-owned Downtown Los Angeles office tower, now in a receiver\u2019s hands after debt default, may offer a clue. Colliers is marketing the $275 million note connected to the property, on behalf of lenders, and expects the note to trade at a massive\ndiscount\n.\nReal estate whodunit solved\nCue the Law &amp; Order theme song \u2026\u00a0 The J.J. Abrams\u2019 Bad Robot building\nmystery buyer\nis Teddy Schwarzman\u2019s Black Bear.\nThe independent studio founded by Schwarzman \u2014 son of Stephen Schwarzman, billionaire chairman and chief executive of Blackstone \u2014 purchased the three-story, brick building located in Santa Monica for about $31 million.\nBut will Schwarzman keep Abrams\u2019 esoteric typewriter sign, an inside joke about the Hollywood pro\u2019s personal style and direction choices?\nAnother mystery.\nEnd of an era\nRelated California chairman and chief executive Bill Witte is\nstepping down\nafter more than three decades at the helm. Witte will become chairman emeritus, and two company executives Gino Canori and Ann Silverberg will split the CEO title effective Jan. 1. Canori will head market-rate, mixed-use and commercial with Silverberg in charge of affordable residential developments.\n",

        "content": "A\nMamdani\nequivalent in Los Angeles? Some are wondering with housing advocate\nRae Huang\nnow in the 2026 race for mayor.\nThe deputy director of affordable housing group Housing Now aims to unseat Karen Bass, with an agenda that isn\u2019t far off from a blend of the mayor\u2019s own 2021 campaign talking points and those of New York City mayor-elect\nZohran Mamdani\n.\nWhile the Los Angeles Times called the the Democratic Socialists of America member (she reportedly pays dues) a \u201clong shot,\u201d it\u2019s notable that Mamdani was a longshot democratic socialist when this year dawned, and another longshot with the same political pedigree, Katie Wilson, just got\nelected mayor of Seattle.\nAgainst that backdrop, Huang joins the mix at a time when talking up public housing and free bus rides have sometimes mobilized voters. Indeed, that\u2019s what she highlighted in her campaign launch video, calling Los Angeles \u201cstuck\u201d when it comes to housing, transit and affordability.\nThe self-described reverend and Sawtelle resident paints a broad brush when it comes to what she intends to tackle: lower rent, housing for all, an economy \u201cfor the people, not the billionaires,\u201d renewable energy, free transit, support for small business and public safety by bolstering mental health services.\nThat was all presented in the video against a montage of imagery that included Bass, the\nPalisades and Eaton fires\nand Downtown L.A.\u2019s biggest commercial black eye in the graffiti towers, AKA\nOceanwide Plaza\n.\nWhile Bass\u2019 No. 1 priority was homelessness at the time of her 2022 swearing in, Huang called the mayor\u2019s programs to date \u201cband-aid\u201d solutions. It\u2019s unclear what the mayoral hopeful\u2019s position is on\nMeasure United to House LA\n, the tax that\u2019s dogged commercial and residential real estate since going into effect in 2023.\n\u201cThe city is unaffordable, and our leaders are unaccountable,\u201d Huang offered.\nCity hall power struggles boil over\nThat last point of Huang\u2019s comment hits on a big headline from this week: accountability at L.A. City Hall.\nWhat\u2019s clearly an internal battle over who the heck is in charge of the rebuilding contracts spilled out into public view on Monday when Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez bluntly asked \u201cWho\u2019s calling the shots with\nAECOM\nand [the city\u2019s Bureau of Engineering]\u201d as Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery members considered whether to move $8 million to the BOE to pay the infrastructure and engineering firm as work gets completed around rebuilding-related strategies.\nRodriguez\u2019 disbelief that spending is happening so loosely with nothing much to show for it as the one-year mark for the Palisades and Eaton fires nears was palpable as she cried \u201cbullshit\u201d over the city\u2019s numerous \u201cfalse starts\u201d in getting homes rebuilt. She offered that Bass\u2019 office \u201ctotally botched the first few months of this recovery,\u201d first tapping a chief recovery officer in\nSteve Soboroff\n, whose clashes with the mayor\u2019s office were well publicized. Then there was a contract with Illinois-based disaster recovery firm\nHagerty Consulting\nthat drew the ire of some Palisades residents who wondered what the company was doing and for how much.\nBass\u2019 office dismissed the latest condemnations.\n\u201cWhile some in the city criticize without providing solutions, Mayor Bass remains focused on leading the fastest disaster recovery effort in modern California history and on getting families home \u2014 full stop,\u201d a spokesperson from the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nOn Measure ULA\nBass\u2019 idea to have the city council pass an ordinance that would allow for a one-time pause on\nMeasure ULA\nfor Palisades residential deals is inching forward.\nThe Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery approved a motion this week requesting the city attorney provide a report in the next 30 days on the feasibility of such a pause.\nThe proposed carveout would apply to single-family homes, condos and other residential properties. Commercial was left out of the discussion with the aim of the pause to \u201ccreate more housing citywide.\u201d The one-time exemption would be good only for a three-year period.\nThe effort would seem to address attempts by Traci Park, who represents the Palisades on the city council and also chairs the recovery committee, to have ULA funds funneled to renters who lost their homes from the fire or to workers who lost their jobs as a result of the fire and could not pay for housing. Park said she was told amendments to ULA, a 2022 ballot measure, could only be handled at the ballot box.\nULA was passed as a means of funding affordable housing and to prevent homelessness with tenant rights education, rental assistance and other programs. Why fire survivors facing housing instability would not qualify for such funds under ULA\u2019s current $425 million budget is unclear.\n",

        "content": "Companies can often represent a mirror of their leaders. Understand the top executive, and you\u2019ll have a better chance to understand the why and how of the organization beneath.\nSo, changes at the top create some intrigue, as is the case for Related California, a subsidiary of the dominant Related Companies and one of the state\u2019s most prolific developers. This week, The Real Deal\u2019s Lauren Elkies-Schram\nbroke the story\nthat Bill Witte, Related California\u2019s chairman and CEO, planned to step down.\nFor more than 35 years, Witte, 74, led the once-upstart Related California and its development of tens of thousands of new housing units \u2014 a portfolio worth several billion dollars \u2014 across the state. To continue his work,\nWitte has tapped two successors\n: company president Gino Canori and in-house affordable housing executive Ann Silverberg. Canori is based in San Francisco and will become president and CEO of Related California\u2019s market rate and mixed-income development group. Silverberg will take over as president and CEO of all affordable housing work.\nSometimes succession plans don\u2019t work out, as evidenced this week by the news that Victor MacFarlane has returned as CEO of the development firm he founded, MacFarlane Partners. MacFarlane, now 74, had stepped down in 2022 from the San Francisco-based company, which the\nSan Francisco Business Times called\n\u201cone of the first and largest Black-owned real estate development firms in the country.\u201d MacFarlane thought he had a succession plan in place, handing the keys and his legacy over to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Landon Taylor.\nAccording to the Business Times, Taylor struggled to \u201cpursue business opportunities without MacFarlane\u2019s involvement.\u201d Taylor is now starting up his own company, LegacyFirst, which will reportedly work with MacFarlane Partners to complete Freedom West, a $2.3 billion megaproject in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore neighborhood envisioned to have more than 2,000 new housing units, a hotel, and commercial space. Momentum on the project\nhas slowed in recent years\n, and MacFarlane told The Real Deal the focus is on entitling the property for the development.\nRegarding succession plans for MacFarlane Partners, MacFarlane, 74, told The Real Deal he has none, and that he now hopes to wrap up the firm before he turns 80.\nWhat hasn\u2019t slowed in San Francisco is the artificial intelligence agency\u2019s grip on commercial real estate. Earlier this week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Nvidia, the multi-trillion-dollar chip manufacturer,\nleased 45,000 square feet at the Mission Rock project,\nwhere they\u2019ll be neighbors with Visa, Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors. Nvidia has largely taken up space in Silicon Valley but now stake out a presence in OpenAI\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood.\nUp around the Embarcadero, OpenAI rival Anthropic, creator of the large-language-model Claude, is reportedly finalizing a long-term lease at 300 Howard Street.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n, the lease terms could be as long as 13 years, and \u201cwould involve the company taking over the entire 420,000-square-foot building.\u201d The building was previously leased to FitBit.\nSuch a lengthy lease would fly in the face of\nthe city\u2019s recent trends.\nYes, high-end office leases are flying off the charts, but many leases are for three-to-five years \u2014 terms which provide necessary flexibility for young companies to grow fast, but add a layer of long-term uncertainty to the local office market.\n",

Newgard is planning Natiivo Fort Lauderdale, a 40-story short-term rental-friendly condominium with 384 units.\nHernandez did not respond to requests for comment, while Kushner\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\nNewgard acquired the site from Kushner and Aimco for\n$31.2 million\nin 2023. The same year, Kushner provided Newgard with a $21.2 million mortgage that the developer failed to repay in full by a June 15 maturity date, the Fort Lauderdale lawsuit alleges. The $22.9 million allegedly owed includes fees and interest.\nTo secure the mortgage, Newgard pledged 100 percent of its equity interest in the development entity as collateral, the foreclosure complaint states.\nAccording to the Miami-Dade complaint, Kushner alleges Hernandez \u201cabsolutely and irrevocably guaranteed and promised to pay the lender, among other things, for any losses, costs, judgments, awards, court costs and legal or other expenses.\u201d\nKushner is also seeking a court order to force Newgard\u2019s affiliate to fork over $23,471 in monthly rent the developer is collecting from using the development site as a parking lot, the lawsuit states.\nLast year, Newgard launched sales for Natiivo Fort Lauderdale, initially enlisting Cervera Real Estate to handle sales. In December,\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\ntook over marketing for the project, which has not yet broken ground.\u00a0Newgard\u2019s other major developments are in partnership with Miami-based Two Roads Development. The joint venture is developing Lofty Brickell and Standard Residences, a pair of condominium projects in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood along the Miami River. In September, the partnership secured\n$513 million\nin construction financing for the two towers.",

The buyer was Pontegadea, the family office of Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega.\nNow Comras is back in a big way. He has scooped up nearly a dozen storefronts, mostly along the 700 and 800 blocks of Lincoln Road. Current tenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery on Lincoln Lane. Comras is designing NoLi as a pedestrian retail experience, lined with boutique storefronts and cafes with outdoor seating and centered around a fountain and landscaping.\nHis investment is another sign of the next era for Lincoln Road. Record rents ($150 to $300 per square foot) set years ago resulted in record vacancies, and a number of storefronts sit empty.\u00a0 National tenants have moved onto competing neighborhoods like the Miami Design District and Wynwood.

Earlier this year, Satter announced plans to develop a spec mansion on the property, listed for $285 million. Now he\u2019s listing the land, with plans for the 55,000-square-foot estate. Satter paid $27.5 million for the ocean-to-Intracoastal Waterway property last year.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMiami commissioners deferred a vote on a Watson Island land sale to their Dec. 11 meeting. The Motwani family\u2019s Merrimac Ventures and BH3 plan to develop a plot on the south side of the island into a mixed-use project with a condo component.

The old headquarters site is home to the Alo Gym and a content studio.\nBreevast U.S., the American offshoot of Dutch investment firm Breevast, was the seller of the three-story La Peer Building. Breevast\nbought the building in 2019\nfor $107.5 million. The sale to Alo marks a 16 percent discount from the previous sale price, but the transaction is still the second-pricest of the year in Beverly Hills.\nThe office market in the ritzy Los Angeles-area city has faced increasing office demand and limited construction, driving down the vacancy rate from 17 percent a year ago to 15 percent. The broader Los Angeles office market is unstable, but the purchase by Alo is the latest transaction in Beverly Hills to buck that trend.\nLast year,\nFashion Nova bought\nthe 175,000-square-foot building nearby at 407 North Maple Drive from Tishman Speyer for $118 million, or $676 per square foot, for its headquarters.\nIn September, Kilroy Realty bought the 290,000-square-foot building at 345 North Maple Drive for $205 million, or $707 per square foot, making it one of the priciest deals of the year in the Los Angeles area. That same month, a\nCorinthia Hotels affiliate bought the office building\nat 9800 Wilshire Boulevard and an adjacent parking structure for $100 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a significant drought in investments for a while, but this deal is a sign we\u2019re turning a corner,\u201d Madison Partners founder and president Bob Safai, who represented Breevast in the deal, told the outlet. \u201cBeverly Hills is always an attraction for high-end investors because they see it as safe in good and bad markets.\u201d\nLa Peer Building has been vacant since 2022 when\nParadigm Talent Agency\nleft the property. Alo\u2019s timeline for moving into the building has not been disclosed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Companies can often represent a mirror of their leaders. Understand the top executive, and you\u2019ll have a better chance to understand the why and how of the organization beneath.\nSo, changes at the top create some intrigue, as is the case for Related California, a subsidiary of the dominant Related Companies and one of the state\u2019s most prolific developers. This week,\nThe Real Deal\n\u2018s Lauren Elkies-Schram\nbroke the story\nthat Bill Witte, Related California\u2019s chairman and CEO, planned to step down.\nFor more than 35 years, Witte, 74, led the once-upstart Related California and its development of tens of thousands of new housing units \u2014 a portfolio worth several billion dollars \u2014 across the state. To continue his work,\nWitte has tapped two successors\n: company president Gino Canori and in-house affordable housing executive Ann Silverberg. Canori is based in San Francisco and will become president and CEO of Related California\u2019s market rate and mixed-income development group. Silverberg will take over as president and CEO of all affordable housing work.\nSometimes succession plans don\u2019t work out, as evidenced this week by the news that Victor MacFarlane has returned as CEO of the development firm he founded, MacFarlane Partners. MacFarlane, now 74, had stepped down in 2022 from the San Francisco-based company, which the\nSan Francisco Business Times called\n\u201cone of the first and largest Black-owned real estate development firms in the country.\u201d MacFarlane thought he had a succession plan in place, handing the keys and his legacy over to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Landon Taylor.\nAccording to the Business Times, Taylor struggled to \u201cpursue business opportunities without MacFarlane\u2019s involvement.\u201d Taylor is now starting up his own company, LegacyFirst, which will reportedly work with MacFarlane Partners to complete Freedom West, a $2.3 billion megaproject in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore neighborhood envisioned to have more than 2,000 new housing units, a hotel, and commercial space. Momentum on the project\nhas slowed in recent years\n, and MacFarlane told\nTRD\nthe focus is on entitling the property for the development.\nRegarding succession plans for MacFarlane Partners, MacFarlane, 74, told\nTRD\nhe has none, and that he now hopes to wrap up the firm before he turns 80.\nWhat hasn\u2019t slowed in San Francisco is the artificial intelligence agency\u2019s grip on commercial real estate. Earlier this week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Nvidia, the multi-trillion-dollar chip manufacturer,\nleased 45,000 square feet at the Mission Rock project,\nwhere they\u2019ll be neighbors with Visa, Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors. Nvidia has largely taken up space in Silicon Valley but now stake out a presence in OpenAI\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood.\nUp around the Embarcadero, OpenAI rival Anthropic, creator of the large-language-model Claude, is reportedly finalizing a long-term lease at 300 Howard Street.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n, the lease terms could be as long as 13 years, and \u201cwould involve the company taking over the entire 420,000-square-foot building.\u201d The building was previously leased to FitBit.\nSuch a lengthy lease would fly in the face of\nthe city\u2019s recent trends.\nYes, high-end office leases are flying off the charts, but many leases are for three-to-five years \u2014 terms which provide necessary flexibility for young companies to grow fast, but add a layer of long-term uncertainty to the local office market.\n",

It\u2019s the most expensive home sale ever recorded in Chicagoland, breaking the previous record of $31.3 million for a\nWinnetka home in August\n.\nThe sale was not recorded in public listing channels, but a Cook County deed recorded Nov. 19 shows the property changed hands for $32.5 million. It was bought and sold under land trusts that obscured the identities of the parties. Because the sale was off-market, the records do not show the real estate agents involved with the deal.\nJena Radnay of @properties Christies International Real Estate brokered the August record-breaker and has been involved in many of the top\nWinnetka sales\nthis year.\nThe Real Deal\ncontacted Radnay about the most recent sale, and she declined to comment.\nThe most recent listing information for the home shows it had five bedrooms and four bathrooms, but satellite images show the home was likely rebuilt since that listing. It was last sold in 2013 for $8 million, and it was listed for sale in 2014 for $10.5 million with @properties, listing portals show. When the home was last listed, it was advertised as a potential teardown.\nThe home sits on about 1.6 acres and had 11,000 square-feet of living space when it was last listed.\nThis is a developing story.\n",

        "content": "Colin Fitzgibbons, president of Hunt Realty Investments and a rising force in North Texas real estate whose career touched some of the region\u2019s most transformative projects, died unexpectedly at 46, leaving behind a deep imprint on Dallas\u2019 development landscape and the colleagues he led.\nThe company did not release a cause of death, though two people close to him told the Dallas Morning News who first\nreported\nhis passing Nov. 21 that he died from complications related to cancer. In a statement, Hunt Realty CEO Chris Kleinert called Fitzgibbons a singular leader whose loyalty, intellect and self-deprecating humor powered the investment firm through a slate of high-impact projects.\nA Dallas native, Fitzgibbons straddled journalism and real estate before choosing the latter. His mother, Ruth Fitzgibbons, was a longtime D Magazine editor, while his father, Jay Fitzgibbons, ran JSC Realty and developed industrial sites across the region. Fitzgibbons tried the newsroom first, working as a sports reporter at The Washington Post, then pivoted to commercial real estate at the\nStaubach Company\nin New York.\nHe returned to Dallas for graduate school at SMU, earning an MBA that propelled him into KDC in 2010. There, he helped steer some of the metroplex\u2019s most ambitious developments: Richardson\u2019s 186-acre, $1.5 billion\nCityLine\n, Plano\u2019s $3 billion Legacy West and Liberty Mutual\u2019s 1-million-square-foot regional hub. Fitzgibbons often said Legacy West was the project he was proudest of, writing on LinkedIn that he loved an industry where \u201cpeople are rewarded if they\u2019re willing to hustle.\u201d\nThat drive led him to Hunt Realty in 2020. Fitzgibbons said the chance to work on marquee developments in Frisco, Uptown and downtown Dallas sealed the deal, along with a seasoned bench he described as one of the firm\u2019s biggest draws. Hunt Realty \u2014 backed by the family of oil magnate H.L. Hunt \u2014 has long shaped the Dallas skyline, from its 1970s investment in the\nReunion project\nto its current role as a heavyweight source of capital.\nBeyond the office, Fitzgibbons was active with The Real Estate Council, NAIOP North Texas, SMU\u2019s Folsom Institute and the Oak Cliff YMCA, reflecting a civic streak that matched his professional ambition.\nHe is survived by his wife, Jessica, and their three sons.\nKleinert\ntold the outlet that Fitzgibbons\u2019 influence at Hunt would endure far beyond his six years at the company, adding that his devotion to family guided how he showed up for colleagues and partners alike.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

At the same time, the median U.S. sale price rose 2.3 percent year over year.\nDallas tied with Jacksonville, Florida, for second place with a decline of 3.3 percent.\nFort Worth is leading a big pack. While the median home sale price increased nationally, it decreased in 18 of the 50 top cities, the most in over two years.\nNew home sales might be applying downward pressure on the resale segment, Dave Bowman, head of the Southlake-based brokerage Century 21 Mike Bowman, speculated.\n\u201c\nThe builders\nare going to make deals, period. Now, they\u2019re not going to go broke doing it. But\nthey\u2019re offering buyers incentives now\n; they have to.

I never saw price appreciation like that, and I\u2019ve been doing this almost 40 years,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting back now to where we were before.\u201d\nThe median Fort Worth-area home sold for $354,000 in October, according to Redfin.

San Antonio led the nation in\ncanceled home purchases\nin July. Dallas and Houston had the highest shares of\ndiscounted sales\nin the country in August. Houston and Austin tied for the greatest\ndecrease in median home prices\nnationally in September. Austin had the\nhighest ratio of sellers to buyers\nin October, and it suffered the\ngreatest loss in average home value\naccording to Zillow in November.Austin also posted the\nlargest decrease in median price\nfor the third quarter, according to TRD Data.\n",

Vista sued Venetos, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex.\nThere\u2019s a fraud element to Vista\u2019s accusation, too. In the suit, the lender accused Venetos of \u201cattempting to obtain credit at another financial institution using false, altered, or fraudulent account statements of Vista.\u201d\nThat makes two lenders going after Venetos for debt remaining after the foreclosure process. Acore is asking for\nan $81 million judgment\nrelated to a $394 million loan tied to properties in Florida and Texas.\nSince the end of October, Venetos has been hit with a\nlawsuit from Fannie Mae\n, accusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex. While some floundering multifamily investors can blame distress on interest rate hikes and floating-rate loans, that\u2019s not the case with this debt, which had a fixed rate of 5.1 percent. Plus, Lurin is on the receiving end of a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nThe list of aggrieved parties is adding up; lenders and investors want their money back, and residents of the aging apartments Lurin still owns are forced to make do in the properties left to waste.\nHard times for Harwood\nHarwood International was dealt\nanother critical blow\n. Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm was trying to hold together its office empire until its next project, Harwood No. 15, could be built. The nationally prominent law firm Jones Day, which occupies 133,000 square feet of another Harwood building and was set to anchor the new project, according to several sources.\nThe news is the latest rough patch in a tough year for the Uptown landlord, which has faced three recent office building foreclosures and lost two properties to lenders so far.\nAustin\u2019s other side\nTexas has seen a sharp downturn in home valuations, and\nAustin\nis leading the pack. The former tech boomtown, which had meteoric growth during the pandemic, has suffered a 20 percent decline in home values, according to Zillow\u2019s Zestimate function. The rest of the Texas Triangle hasn\u2019t fared well either. The top five cities for home valuation losses include Austin, San Antonio and Dallas.\nAnother look at Tesla deal\nNot sure if the dip in home values has folks in Travis County, home of Austin, getting cranky over its deal with Elon Musk, but the locals are\nholding up Tesla\u2019s tax incentives\n. The EV giant has paid $19 million in county property taxes since 2021; per a 2020 agreement, it\u2019s eligible for rebates of up to 80 percent. However, the agreement caps the percentage of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers \u2014 contractors and temporary staff \u2014 Tesla can count toward its job totals. For the first decade of the contract, just 30 percent of qualifying full-time roles can be held by contingent workers. Tesla, however, is refusing the provide that information.\nSharp sense of history\nA Houston home\nonce owned by fraudster Frank Sharp\nsold after asking double the price of its last trade. The 11,200-square-foot mansion at 2307 River Oaks Boulevard was last listed for $16 million. The seller, steel magnate Daniel Benditz, bought the property in 2015 when it was asking $7.9 million. Until 1984, the home belonged to Sharp, the developer behind the Oak Forest neighborhood and Sharpstown, the city\u2019s first master-planned subdivision. He was found guilty of a stock fraud scheme that brought down several prominent Texas politicians in the 1970s.\nSaks says downtown Neiman to stay put for now\nIn February, Saks Global gave the Neiman Marcus flagship store in downtown Dallas just weeks to live.

        "content": "Steve Ross bought the One Clearlake office tower for $55.4 million, expanding his empire in downtown West Palm Beach, where he is the dominant developer and investor.\nRoss\u2019 West Palm-based Related Ross bought the 18-story building at 250 South Australian Avenue from Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors, according to records. The buyer secured a $40 million loan from City National Bank of Florida.\nCompleted in 1987 on a 2.9-acre lot, One Clearlake spans about 221,700 square feet and\u00a0 includes an attached four-story, 669-space garage, according to records. Roughly 20 percent of the office space is available for lease, according to a Related Ross spokesperson.\nTenants include Northwestern Mutual, Ideal Nutrition, RM Anderson Co., SouthState Loan Office and Rubenstein Law.\nThe purchase marks at least Related Ross\u2019 11th office property in downtown West Palm, including those purchased, developed, under construction and planned.\nThe tower is adjacent to the two-story, 70,100-square-foot WPTV studio and office building at 1100 Banyan Boulevard, which Related Ross bought for\n$40 million\nin May.\nThe One Clearlake and WPTV sites now give Related Ross a combined 7.6 contiguous acres facing Clear Lake.\nAny potential redevelopment would have to wait because The E.W. Scripps Company, WPTV\u2019s parent company, leased back its building for a term of at least two and a half years.\nThis is the second time One Clearlake traded this year. In May, Bradford Allen bought it for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from its sale price four years ago. The sellers \u2013 Rockpoint and New England Development, both based in Boston, Miami-based Tricera, and Palm Beach-based NDT Development \u2013\u2013 had paid\n$60.7 million\nfor One Clearlake in 2021.\nRoss, 85, founded New York-based Related Companies over 50 years ago. After leading the firm that helped shape New York\u2019s skyline, he stepped back last year, carved out Related\u2019s Southeast division and put it under his newly founded\nRelated Ross\n. Related Ross primarily focuses on downtown West Palm and also on other South Florida areas.\nThis year, Related Ross completed the 25-story\nOne Flagler\nat the foot of the Royal Palm Bridge. It\u2019s also developing the\n10 CityPlace and 15 CityPlace\noffice towers on the site of AMC West Palm Beach 12 at 545 Hibiscus Street, and at the closed Brio Italian Grille at 550 South Rosemary Avenue.\nAside from offices, Related Ross also has built apartments and is developing condos in downtown West Palm. The firm\u2019s portfolio includes the CityPlace mixed-use complex that Related Companies completed in 2000.\nRoss\n, a major benefactor in Palm Beach County, has played a role in the county\u2019s reinvention. The billionaire has tapped his New York network to lease up his West Palm offices with financial firms, aligning with county boosters\u2019 yearslong push to turn the county into \u201cWall Street South.\u201d More recently, he has talked about attracting tech firms, in a bid to create \u201cSilicon Valley South\u201d in Palm Beach County. He also supported Vanderbilt University\u2019s plan to open a campus in West Palm.\nRoss remains nonexecutive chairman and the biggest single shareholder at Related Companies.\n",

Last possible days of operation range from Dec. 31 to Jan. 31.\nSan Francisco Centre\u2019s imminent demise comes after a\nforeclosure auction\nlast week shifted control of the 5.9-acre, two-building complex to a mortgage trust owed nearly $600 million by previous owners Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties. The pair defaulted and abandoned its ownership post in 2023. The mall\u2019s new owner is an LLC known as DBJPM 2016-SFC Emporium.\nThe trust, advised by special servicer Midland Loan Servicing, was the only one to submit a minimum bid of $133 million, or 70 percent of the property\u2019s assessed value of roughly $195 million,\nper\nthe Business Times. The sales price was a far cry from the more than $1.2 billion value the property boasted in 2016.\nTenants have been voluntarily\nfleeing San Francisco Centre in droves\nover the past two years. Occupancy collapsed to roughly 9 percent after Nordstrom and Bloomingdale\u2019s walked away from their anchor leases at the shopping center in 2023 and earlier this year, respectively, helping trigger a cascade of store closures. Only two restaurants remain open after several\nrestaurants and retailers closed this summer\n.\nCBRE has been tapped to market the 1.2-million-square-foot property for sale, and a sales brochure is framing the site as a chance to transform the existing structure or pursue a large-scale mixed-use redevelopment on Market Street. It\ncan\u2019t, however, be turned into housing\nin its current form, as nine of the shopping center\u2019s floors don\u2019t get enough sunlight legally required for new housing units.\nBy emptying out a retail property this large, with few profitable tenants inside, the mall\u2019s owners could lower the daily operating cost of maintaining the site, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. At the same time, prospective buyers would have a clean slate to do whatever they want with the mall. JLL is staying on as the manager of the property under its new ownership.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

He sang the same tune at an\nevent\nThe Real Deal\nand his firm put on in Downtown Austin in October.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t sell them, fucking kick the keys back,\u201d he said.\nThe real estate investor and CEO of Rastagar Capital may have to do just that, as he is facing foreclosure on the four properties tied to a $22.7 million loan from Greystone, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The debt works out to $139,263 per unit.\nThe loan is backed by Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender,\u201d a dispute he plans to continue litigating even if he loses the properties. He added that the properties are such a small percentage of his portfolio.\nHe\u2019s focusing on the firm\u2019s high-profile projects, like\nInfinity Square\n, a 318-acre master-planned community between Austin and San Antonio in Kyle. At full build-out, Infinity Square will have 1,000 single-family homes and 1,400 apartments. He secured a\n$31.7 million construction loan\nfrom Trez Capital for the project in 2024.\nRastegar also said Class C apartments in Austin have been \u201cannihilated by the market.\u201d\nAustin has been flooded with a historic glut of multifamily deliveries in the last few years. Deliveries peaked in 2024, and Rent Cafe predicts the city will see 26,715 units delivered by the end of this year, a 5 percent drop from 2024.\nThe apartment oversupply has put a downward pressure on rents, which have fallen so much that it\u2019s become the most affordable city in the country for renters, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said at a\nTexas multifamily conference\nthis summer.\nEven in the face of foreclosure, Rastegar appears to be maintaining his cool. \u201cThis is part of the business, dude.\u201d\n",

He and others argue that the rules would disrupt the city\u2019s housing market by tying up inventory and scaring investors away.\nNurse is expected to introduce amendments to the bill, though as of Friday, the potential changes on the table appeared to be minimal, according to one source familiar with negotiations.\nMultifamily \u201cbomb\u201d\nUnder COPA, owners looking to sell their buildings would need to notify HPD at least 180 days before moving forward with such plans. They also need to provide the agency with various records, including a detailed income and expense report for the past year.\nThen a \u201cqualified entity\u201d \u2014\u00a0defined as nonprofits on HPD\u2019s\nQualified Preservation Buyers List\nor community land trusts, which are committed to providing housing affordable to low- to extremely-low income tenants \u2014\u00a0has 60 days to submit a notice that they intend to bid on the property. The qualified entity has 120 days from the owner\u2019s notice to HPD to make an offer.\u00a0 During that time, the owner cannot accept other offers, giving the qualified entity time to match any other bids.\nDelayed closings can make it harder to line up financing and get title insurance. Injecting uncertainty into these deals would deter investors and lenders, opponents say.\n\u201cIt will slow transactions dramatically,\u201d said Matt Cosentino, who leads multifamily sales at Brooklyn-based brokerage TerraCRG. \u201cA lot of the owners that we deal with are smaller, so-called mom and pop owners, who don\u2019t necessarily have time to waste.\u201d\nSuch rules also preclude 1031 exchanges, he said. These deals, which allow a real estate investor to defer capital gains from the sale of one property by investing that profit into a similar property, must close within a 180-day window.\nFor some, the mere concept of the city getting involved in these transactions is anathema.\n\u201cThe idea of having to tell your government that you are selling your property seems like the most basic, un-American idea,\u201d Cosentino said.\nDeveloper Humberto Lopes called the bill \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described its requirements as an unfair steering to a specific kind of buyer.\n\u201cWhat gives you the right to supersede everybody?\u201d he asked.\nProponents of the bill say it will help curb speculation and level the playing field for nonprofits to bid on properties.\nLast year, East New York Community Land Trust bought a 21-unit, rent-stabilized apartment at 248 Arlington Avenue for $3 million. The group was able to do so without COPA, but Hannah Anousheh, director of the East New York Community Land Trust, said the bill will help pave the way for deals where the landlord is not willing to negotiate with tenants or nonprofits.\nThe East New York Community Land Trust is working with the building\u2019s tenants to convert their units to co-ops. In this arrangement, the group will maintain ownership of the land and the building is leased to the co-op, where prices are kept at a certain level.\n\u201cThis is about helping to bring tons of buildings under responsible ownership,\u201d Anousheh said.\nNational trend\nOther cities have implemented\nsimilar policies\n. In San Francisco, nonprofits have 30 days to act on their right of first refusal. Washington, D.C., is home to the nation\u2019s oldest Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, enacted in 1980, where a building\u2019s tenants are given the first crack at buying their building. Chicago is\npiloting\nits own version. The state legislature in New York has also proposed a version of TOPA.\nCritiques of these programs are similar to those raised around COPA in New York and led to\namendments\nto TOPA in Washington, D.C., this year. Still, since 2006, tens of thousands of D.C. units have been preserved as affordable as a result of TOPA, according to a 2023 report by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\nSupporters and even some critics of these policies agree that the success of COPA and TOPA programs hinges on nonprofits being able to tap into a steady stream of capital and tenants\u2019 ability to organize.\nSome of the owners who spoke to\nThe Real Deal\nabout COPA thought a pilot version that applied to a smaller pool of buildings, along a shorter window than 180 days, would potentially be workable.\nNurse would not comment on what amendments she is considering, but in a statement, said that her bill has the support of 33 other council members and 35 affordable housing providers.\n\u201cWe are in an affordability crisis in New York City and COPA gives us another tool to preserve and create more affordable housing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are thrilled to be engaging with many stakeholders to develop a program that helps us address the housing crisis.\u201d\nJay Martin, executive vice president of the New York Apartment Association, called the bill\u2019s scope \u201cridiculous\u201d and said few nonprofits are in a position to buy buildings, especially those that require extensive renovations.\n\u201cAnother buyer into the market isn\u2019t the problem. It is that the resources needed to buy the buildings aren\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s also a question of whether HPD\u2019s staff will be overwhelmed as the intermediary in these deals.\nDuring the June\nhearing\n, HPD echoed that concern, recommending that the program be narrowly tailored to the distressed buildings to avoid administrative challenges and negative impacts to the housing market.\nAgency spokesperson Matt Rauschenbach said on Friday that HPD remains \u201cengaged\u201d with Nurse.\n\u201cWhen legislation is proposed that may significantly impact the housing landscape, we are committed to providing input and feedback to ensure that all potential effects are fully evaluated and considered,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThese negotiations are happening as the industry also tries to fend off a\nbill\nthat would set minimum construction wages for housing projects with 100 or more units that receive $1 million or more in public financing. The Council is also considering a\ntrio of bills\nthat would set minimum thresholds for the percentage of two- and three-room apartments in city-funded projects, cap the percentage of studio apartments in senior housing and mandate that a minimum percentage of city-funded housing is affordable to very and extremely low-income tenants.\nOne affordable housing developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, posited that the City Council, in the final weeks of the Adams administration, is trying to reclaim oversight over housing in the city, after voters approved ballot measures that weaken its authority over certain land use actions.\n\u201cOverall, they just keep making it harder to do business in New York City,\u201d the developer said. \u201cWe are at a point where the city council and certain advocates are viewing investors as a negative.\u201d\n",

Architecture firm CetraRuddy, which has become a go-to for office-to-residential conversions across the city, is leading the redesign.\nAbramson Brothers has owned the building since around the time of its founding in 1957. This will be the firm\u2019s first office-to-residential conversion.\nPlans call for ground-floor retail and parking, while the bulk of the 1928 building is slated to become apartments. The lower level will include a co-working space. Amenities include a fitness center and terrace.\nAdam Abramson, who is listed as the applicant on the filing, said he plans to use the\n467m tax incentive program\n, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting outdated office buildings into apartments. He declined to comment further on the project, saying they are early in the process. The plans were first reported by PincusCo.\nThe project adds to a growing roster of conversions in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Midtown West, where smaller office footprints and fluctuating demand have pushed landlords toward residential conversions. Older mid-rise buildings like 333 West 52nd Street have emerged as prime candidates for redevelopment.\nNearby, Yellowstone Real Estate Investments is\nconverting the 600-key Watson Hotel\nin Hell\u2019s Kitchen into a 249-unit apartment building. Isaac Hera\u2019s firm is also planning\na 422-unit conversion\nof a Midtown West office building at 1730 Broadway.\nMadigan Development\nis converting a 12-story Midtown property at 45 West 55th Street into a 17-story residential building that will feature 42 units.\n",

        "content": "You might have heard that landlords are\ngoing crazy\nabout COPA.\nWord is spreading that the City Council aims to reduce rents by giving nonprofits an exclusive window to buy apartment buildings before profiteers can.\nCouncil members are close to voting on a bill from Sandy Nurse called the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act.\nIf COPA is a good idea, why not apply the same logic to things besides housing? After all, the affordability problem is also about food, clothing, energy and other necessities.\nTake supermarkets, for example. These profit-seeking institutions buy food from wholesalers, then mark up the prices so they can make a profit. Outrageous, right?\nSupermarkets\u2019 profit margins\nrange from 1 percent to as high as 3 percent. No wonder so many New Yorkers go hungry!\nAs socialists repeatedly tell us, profit makes things more expensive for consumers. The official slogan of the New York City tenants group Metropolitan Council on Housing is \u201c\nhousing for people, not profit\n.\u201d\nSo, to make food cheaper, I propose COPA for Groceries. Let\u2019s call it COPA-G.\nHere\u2019s the plan: Before farmers or manufacturers sell food to a store, restaurant, catering business or food cart, they would have to notify nonprofits of the opportunity to purchase it.\nSoup kitchens and other charities would have an exclusive window to buy this food before the greedy capitalists do. When\nZohran Mamdani\nopens his four\ncity-run supermarkets\n, they could get in on the action.\nThe window would have to be shorter for fruit, vegetables, meat and other perishables so not too much of it spoils during the waiting period. For products with a long shelf life, such as cereal, nonprofits would have 120 days to put in their bids, just like with COPA for buildings.\nAre you with me? Cheap food, people!\nWith a good video from Mamdani\u2019s social media team and a door-knocking operation by the\nDemocratic Socialists of America\n, we could quickly build popular support for this idea.\nOnce the law takes effect and proof of concept is achieved, as it surely would be, we could expand it to other products. Nonprofit thrift shops could get six months to buy clothing and shoes from manufacturers before evil retailers can get their claws on these desperately needed items and extort New Yorkers who need them.\nA side benefit of COPA-C (for clothing) is that some items might be out of fashion by the time the capitalists get them, forcing retailers to put them on the discount rack. New Yorkers could then experience what it\u2019s like to shop in Cuba, which would be a nice benefit to people who can\u2019t afford international vacations.\nCynics might say this would never work. They note that COPA-type laws in other cities\nmerely delay sales\n, and that tenants and nonprofits were already free to bid on buildings at any time.\nBesides, the critics say, nonprofit landlords in New York City are\nstruggling\nto keep their rent-stabilized buildings above water, because the\nHSTPA\nin 2019 put a tourniquet on rents,\nhousing court\nmakes it\nincredibly time-consuming\nto evict tenants who don\u2019t pay and insurance premiums have soared.\nThe skeptics also point out that even if buildings are owned by nonprofits, they must still generate more revenue than they pay in operating expenses. This surplus is technically not \u201cprofit,\u201d but it\u2019s used to pay the salaries of staffers and executives.\nFor example, mission-driven Riseboro Community Partnership, one of the city\u2019s best nonprofit housing providers,\npaid its staffers $30 million\nand its executives $2.5 million last year \u2014 which accounted for 46 percent of its expenses.\nI have a message for all the COPA critics: Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.\n",

        "content": "A developer and a nonprofit are reading up on how to update a library into a mixed-use complex with more than 100 rent-stabilized apartments.\nCity officials tapped Kalel Companies and nonprofit Settlement Housing Fund to redevelop the Grand Concourse Library in the Claremont section of the South Bronx, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The site at 155 East 173rd Street will become The Heartwood, complete with 113 units atop the renovated library.\nThe residences are all intended to be affordable, rent-stabilized units. A chunk of those units will be reserved for those previously experiencing homelessness. Amenities will include outdoor terraces, community rooms and a fitness center.\nThe library will span more than 17,000 square feet and include meeting rooms, study areas and a host of technological options. The New York Public Library is looking for funding to launch a temporary branch for the duration of the renovation.\nIt\u2019s expected to be certified as an\nenvironmentally friendly Passive House\n, which would make it the first branch in the public library system to receive that designation.\nThere\u2019s no estimated cost for the project available. The timeline is also murky, as the project will need to go through the land-use review procedure.\nBut it is part of a broader effort known as the Living Libraries initiative, designed to add more housing and services to the library system. The New Utrecht Library in Bensonhurst is being targeted for potential affordable housing additions.\nSettlement Housing Fund has experience in the Bronx and a development portfolio of more than 8,900 units since its founding more than 50 years ago. The nonprofit was\nthe agent\nfor the entity owning the Starrett City apartment complex when Rockpoint Group and Brooksville Partners took full control in 2021.\nKalel Companies, which has preserved or redeveloped more than 4,000 homes, recently\nmade waves\nwhen it partnered with the Masjid Abdul Muhsi Khalifah mosque on a mixed-use redevelopment of the latter\u2019s space at 1166 Bedford Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\nThe venture aims to raze the three-story property and replace it with a 12-story, 94,000-square-foot building with 144 senior housing units.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners sold an oceanfront penthouse at its Seaway at the Surf Club for $86 million, making it the most expensive condo ever sold in Miami-Dade County.\nRecords show the Fort Partners affiliate SCR Residences LLC sold unit PH-11 at 9149 Collins Avenue in Surfside to Surfclub 11 LLC, a Delaware entity. Public details about the unit are limited, but it spans 16,053 square feet. That means the sale works out to $5,358 per square foot.\nIt tops\nthe previous condo price record\nin Miami-Dade, set last year at Fort\u2019s adjacent condo, Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club, when an entity tied to Apple sold an oceanfront penthouse for $44 million.\nBut winning the title could be a short-lived victory. Last year, a penthouse at the to-be-completed Auberge-branded Shore Club in Miami Beach reportedly went into contract for\n$120 million\n. The deal has not closed, but could as soon as next year if Witkoff Group and Monroe Capital finish the 49-unit oceanfront development by its projected 2026 completion date. If it sells at that price, it would set a Miami-Dade record for both condo sales and residential sales overall.\nThese sales are another symptom of the region\u2019s wealth migration. As a wave of billionaire and multimillionaire buyers moved into the market, demand surged for homes at the\nextreme end of the luxury scale\n.\nAshi completed the 34-unit, 11-story, two-building\nSeaway\nlast year. The design team included architect Joseph Dirand and landscape designer Peter Wirtz. Seaway residents have access to the amenities at the Surf Club next door, which includes four pools, a private club and Thomas Keller restaurant.\nThe Seaway complex has attracted a set of high-profile buyers since closings began last year. Jeff and Shari Aronson, the philanthropist founders of Coconut Grove-based Centerbridge Foundation, bought a unit for $12.3 million. David Foley, a senior managing director in Blackstone\u2019s private equity group, bought a condo for $24.5 million. In January, financier Bippy Siegal and his wife, Jacqueline Siegal, bought a trio of units for\n$18.5 million\n. In December, an entity linked to health care mogul Frederick Howe bought two units for a combined\n$31.1 million\n.",

        "content": "A home on Bayview Drive was the latest to sell for more than $8 million in Lake Geneva last week, extending the bull run on lakefront property in the Wisconsin resort town this fall.\nThe home at 831 Bayview Drive sold in an off-market transaction on Nov. 17 for $8.3 million. The 7,100-square-foot house has five bedrooms and two bathrooms. It has between 50 and 100 feet of lake frontage, according to listing information.\nCompass agent Daniel Oleston represented the sellers, and Wendy Murphy with Mahler Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyers. Both declined to comment on the sale.\nThe home\u2019s buyers appear to have traded their previous Lake Geneva residence for the larger Bayview Drive home. The buyers were Philip and Melody Lekousis, who sold a 3,300-square-foot house on\nPark Drive for $6 million\nearlier in November, according to public records. Wayne and Brenda Williams were the sellers.\nLake Geneva, along with other\nChicagoland waterfront getaways\nlike the North Shore and southeast Michigan, has had a luxury market boom this fall. The Bayview Drive sale is the seventh lakefront home to sell in\nLake Geneva\nsince October, and the fourth to fetch a price of more than $8 million. One of those homes is next door at 837 Bayview Drive, which sold in October for $8.6 million.\nOther notable sales this fall include a Lake Shore Drive house that\nclosed for $10.3 million\n, about $500,000 above its asking price, and another on Bonnie Brae Lane that sold for\n$8.7 million\n.\nThe highest sale price for Lake Geneva this year came in June, when an\nestate on Lackey Lane\nsold off market for $20 million.\nThe Bayview Drive house was last sold in November 2022 for $5.8 million. The 2025 price tag marks a 43 percent appreciation in about three years, in line with other homes on the lakefront that have seen their values surge in the post-pandemic years.\nThe fall heat may be cooling down going into the winter: only two lakefront homes are currently listed for sale in Lake Geneva, and both appear to have had trouble finding buyers.\nA 7,800-square-foot spec build was listed for nearly $10 million in September, and dropped its asking price by about $1 million on Friday. A 3,900-square-foot log cabin-style home has struggled to find footing, cutting its ask from $6.75 million in August to a current $5.6 million after two price chops.\n",

        "content": "A rare pulse of capital is hitting Chicago\u2019s moribund office market, where a $700 million refinancing for the Bank of America Tower is moving ahead as many downtown landlords are still fighting for survival.\nThe deal, backed by mortgage bonds, stands out in a city where few investors have been willing to touch office paper. The tower\u2019s\nowners\n\u2014 Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital \u2014 are taking on the debt. The sale marks the largest office-backed bond offering in Chicago since the pandemic, a sign that commercial mortgage-backed securities buyers will still write checks for top-tier assets, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nChicago\u2019s office fundamentals are still scraping bottom. The city\u2019s vacancy rate climbed to a record 26.5 percent in the third quarter, according to CBRE. While New York has started to regain some\nmomentum\n, Chicago continues to wrestle with hollowed-out towers, sluggish leasing and the lingering drag of remote work.\nThe Bank of America Tower, though, remains one of the\nexceptions\n. The 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive is 98 percent leased, with Bank of America anchoring 17 floors and contributing roughly a third of total rent, according to bond documents cited by the publication. Its riverfront site and proximity to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center have kept it competitive, and its slate of amenities \u2014 including restaurants from celebrity chefs such as Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \u2014 gives it the kind of hospitality edge landlords now need to draw tenants.\nThe refinancing replaces a loan held by a group of banks, the outlet reported, and lands at a moment when falling interest rates have started to thaw capital markets.\nOffice-backed CMBS issuance all but froze after the pandemic, eventually saddling bondholders with once-unthinkable losses on AAA-rated slices. The resurgence began about a year ago with splashy New York deals tied to Rockefeller Center and the MetLife Building. Chicago, still viewed warily by many national investors, hadn\u2019t yet joined that rebound.\nBut earlier this year,\nSalesforce Tower\n\u2014 just across the Chicago River from the Bank of America building \u2014 secured a $610 million refinancing, another data point suggesting lenders are tiptoeing back into the Class A towers with strong rent rolls.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The four-bedroom apartment was the priciest of 29 properties in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals last week.\nAn entity tied to Falic bought Unit 32A from the developer in 2018 for\n$26.5 million\n. In August 2022, he listed the 3,700-square-foot condo for $37.5 million before pulling it off the market three months later.

Billionaire hedge funder Joseph Edelman bought the Lenox Hill condo through an LLC in 2008 for $30.5 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nEdelman first sought to offload the 7,200-square-foot apartment in 2021, when he listed it for more than $33 million. But the unit struggled to find a buyer a year later, even after Edelman dropped the asking price to just under $30 million, and he pulled it from the market. He listed it again in March with a $30 million price tag, though he lowered it to $27 million six months later.\nThe triplex has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

Amenities in the 11-unit building, developed by Property Markets Group, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche, Clare Cukier, Michelle Flikerski, Catherine Rutter and Reilly Lavrich had the listing.\nThe total of 29 pending deals was up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n. Of the properties, 22 were condos, five were co-ops and two were townhouses. Half of the contracts signed were for new development homes.\nThe properties asked a combined $243 million, which works out to an average price of $8.4 million and a median of $5.2 million.

        "content": "A troubled Midtown condo project is sliding deeper into disarray as its developer faces another aggressive move from a lender.\nWaterfall Asset Management is seeking to seize Rudy Gabsi\u2019s stake in 611 West 56th Street after the developer allegedly ignored an eight-figure court judgment tied to the luxury tower, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court to take control of Gabsi\u2019s 90 percent interest in the 35-story, 80-unit building, according to the court filing.\nIn May, a judge ordered Gabsi to pay $92.1 million for defaulting on a 2016 loan backing the project. He never paid, the suit says, nor did he show up to defend himself. With interest and fees, the tab has climbed to $93.4 million.\nWaterfall wants the court to authorize the sheriff to seize any documents needed to transfer Gabsi\u2019s ownership stake. The lender wants a judge to reroute future condo-sale proceeds from the building directly into its hands.\nGabsi personally guaranteed the debt on the project, developed with Sumaida + Khurana.\nReaching him has proven difficult. His Leny Group lists no contact information and court records place him in Tel Aviv. Waterfall and its attorney, meanwhile, did not return calls from the publication.\nThe tower opened in 2022 on a gritty edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen known historically as Automobile Row, sporting an offering plan projecting a $232 million sellout. But units have been slow to move: nine sponsor apartments were still on the market Friday, priced from $1.1 million to $6.7 million.\nThe fight adds to a growing pile of setbacks for Gabsi, whose New York portfolio has been unraveling since the pandemic. His boutique condo at 534 West 29th Street was headed for auction this fall over a defaulted mortgage until he signed over the keys in a deed-in-lieu agreement.\nEarlier this year, he also lost six mixed-use sites in Williamsburg through a bankruptcy process after defaulting on a $92 million note; CIM Group picked up the properties\nfor $56 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani named 24 people to his transition committee on housing. Here are the real estate people who made the cut.\nMamdani started the week by naming more than 400 people to 17 different committees. The housing-related group includes nonprofit housing organizations, union reps, Yimby groups, religious leaders, tenant groups, private real estate developers and multifamily lenders.\nThose representing the private side include:\nReal Estate Board of New York Chair and Two Trees Management CEO Jed Walentas\nL+M CEO Lisa Gomez\nM Squared COO Carolee Fink\nMerchants Capital vice chair Matt Wambua\nNew York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Carlina Rivera (a nonprofit that represents affordable housing developers)\nThe representatives from the private sector are largely affordable housing developers, though obviously REBNY represents various sectors in the industry. The committee doesn\u2019t include leaders from the landlord groups that mostly represent rent-stabilized owners, but it does include Rafael Cestero, CEO of the Community Preservation Corporation, who has been\nsounding the alarm\nabout\nmounting distress\nin the city\u2019s stabilized housing stock.\nSome members of the committee are also veterans of the de Blasio and Bloomberg administrations. Gomez was a senior vice president at the city\u2019s Housing Development Corporation under Bloomberg.\nFink was chief of staff to Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen during the de Blasio administration. Before that, she was executive vice president and chief development officer of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. She also was a senior advisor to Deputy Mayor Robert Steel under Bloomberg.\nWambua headed the Department of Housing Preservation and Development under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Before that, he was executive vice president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation and had served as a senior policy advisor for Dan Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development.\n(If the name Merchants rings a bell: My colleague wrote about Merchants\u2019 parent company,\nMerchant Bank\n, which lent to a number of people who were charged as part of a federal mortgage fraud probe. During the second quarter, the bank recorded write-downs for 14 customers totaling $46.1 million in the second quarter this year, citing fraud.)\nThe Partnership for New York\u2019s Kathy Wylde was named to a separate committee focused on economic and workforce development.\nOn the tenant side, the committee includes New York State Tenant Bloc\u2019s Cea Weaver, CAAAV\u2019s Alina Shen, Legal Aid Society\u2019s Adriene Holder, New York Communities for Change\u2019s Olivia Leirer and Community Service Society\u2019s Iziah Thompson.\nPro-housing policy reps include Open New York\u2019s Annemarie Gray, Regional Plan Association\u2019s Moses Gates and Paul Williams, executive director of the think tank Center for Public Enterprise.\nSomething else that is likely to catch the attention of the industry: At least five representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America were named to various committees.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What issues do you think should be at the top of the agenda for the housing-focused transition committee? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Tuesday marks a largely\nforgotten\nNovember celebration known as \u201cEvacuation Day,\u201d which marked the day that British troops left Manhattan after the Revolutionary War in 1783.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Monday\ndismissed\nmortgage fraud charges against state Attorney General Tish James. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in an order that Lindsey Halligan, the acting federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia who charged James, was improperly appointed and had \u201cno lawful authority to present the indictment.\u201d\n\u2014 ICYMI, the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America voted against endorsing Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 in his potential primary challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Through an online survey, 626 members voted against the endorsement, 555 voted in favor and 24 abstained. After the results of the vote were released, Oss\u00e9 posted on X: \u201cNYC DSA FOREVER \u2764\ufe0f IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$6.3 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 830 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer, and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$80.8 million\nfor the 87,620-square-foot, 12-story office building at 322-326 Seventh Avenue in Chelsea. GDS Development Management completed the project in 2022 and was sold to Capstone Equities.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$8.5 million\nfor a 2,723-square-foot condominium unit at 23 East 22nd Street in the Flatiron District. The Riback Team at Corcoran has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The approval comes after the home passed inspection and was deemed safe to inhabit.\nThe property was sold a year ago, a couple of months before the wildfire that would destroy the structure, for $3.4 million according to the report. Neither the cost nor value of the new home on the site have been disclosed.\nThe home was built by developer\nThomas James Homes\n. The permitting process for the property took two months, while the rebuild took six. \u201cGiven that the community needs housing, we thought this would be a great opportunity to show them what we can do,\u201d Thomas James chief executive Jamie Mead said.\nThomas James Homes bought the property before the fires ripped through the Pacific Palisades in January; the company purchased the home for $3.4 million last November. The new Palisades home is larger than its previous iteration, spanning four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms across nearly 4,000 square feet. By contrast, the original home that burned down was a 1,600-square-foot ranch. The rebirthed Kagawa Street property boasts fire-resistant features like closed eaves to block embers and plumbing for a fire defense system that homeowners can opt to add; in the case of an approaching fire, the home will be covered in water and fire retardant.\nThe new home was constructed as a showcase home, meant to show other residents looking to rebuild what could be possible for their burned lots. Thomas James Homes is building residences for 30 families in the Palisades and plans to build 100 more next year. A grand opening for the home, in which the community will be able to visit, is set for Dec. 6.\nSo far, nearly 2,000 permits have been issued in both the Palisades and\nEaton fire\nzones,\naccording\nto the state\u2019s rebuilding dashboard.

        "content": "Meritage Homes\nis continuing its building blitz across Greater Los Angeles with a redevelopment plan in West Covina.\nMeritage subsidiary MLC Holdings is planning to build a townhome development on a former school site at 1501 Del Norte Street, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The proposal calls for constructing 282 homes, including 248 attached townhomes and flats and 34 detached single-family homes, on a 13.5-acre site.\nThe homes would be delivered in two- to four-story buildings. Floor plans would include a mix of two-, three- and four-bedroom units. The development would come with 641 parking spaces as well as an 18,000-square-foot central community park with a pool, shade structures, barbecue space and lawn. Designs for the project are being handled by KTGY and C2 Collaborative.\nIf city officials sign off on the project, including a general plan amendment and a zone change, construction of the Spanish and Seaside-style development could break ground as early as January. Construction is expected to take two years to complete.\nMeritage Homes has other townhome projects in the pipeline. The Scottsdale, Arizona-based firm is currently developing a 93-unit townhome project in Norwalk and an 86-unit endeavor in Santa Ana. The firm\nbought the vacant office building\nwhere the latter project will rise at 2020 East First Street earlier this year for $19.2 million.\nLast week, Meritage bought the former Trinity Broadcasting Network campus in Costa Mesa for $44.5 million with plans to turn the 70,800-square-foot property into 142 homes. The purchase comes after it secured approvals from the\nCity of Costa Mesa\nin August to build housing at the site. Irvine-based Khoshbin Company bought the site in 2021 for $22 million and marketed it as an event venue prior to its sale;\nMLC previously worked with the Khoshbin Company\non a housing development plan for the location. Meritage, acting through MLC, is planning for detached two-story single-family homes and four-story stacked flats at the site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The City of Pleasanton is weighing a large-scale redevelopment of parking lots surrounding the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station into as many as 1,300 homes.\nThe Pleasanton City Council reviewed early conceptual plans from city staff to begin the process of redeveloping the 14.9-acre site at 5835 and 5859 Owens Drive into a transit-oriented, mixed-use community, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. Bay Area Rapid Transit owns 250 acres of developable land in 22 cities across the region; the transit authority believes the land has the potential to hold more than 28,000 units of housing.\nThe City Council reviewed two options from staffers that could eventually shape what a request for proposals from developers would look like. One option calls for building 870 to 1,088 units in two five-story buildings and two-seven story buildings; the other proposes between 1,047 and 1,309 units in two seven-story buildings and one five-to-eight-story building. The property can be split into three or four parcels, with city officials leaving the door open to future developments like hotels, offices or education space.\nThe Dublin/Pleasanton BART station was identified as a housing opportunity site as part of its housing element. When the City created that housing plan, it estimated that the site could house up to 555 units. New state legislation incentivizing transit-oriented development, however, has allowed developers to swing bigger on such projects near train stations, bumping up the purported capacity at the Pleasanton station by more than double. Under AB 2923, transit-oriented projects near some hubs in the Bay Area must have a minimum density of 75 units per acre and a minimum height of five stories; of those units, 20 percent must be set aside as affordable housing.\nUnder its housing element, the City of Pleasanton must\nplan\nfor 5,965 new units of housing by 2031.\nOther BART stations in the region are already becoming the center of new transit-oriented developments. Last year, Oakland-based affordable housing developer East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation broke ground on a 97-unit, seven-story affordable senior housing\nbuilding at the Lake Merritt BART station\n; that project is the first phase of a mixed-use development that will ultimately boast more than 550 units.\nThe\nNorth Berkeley\nand Ashby BART stations are similarly getting new developments. In July, city officials chose Adeline Alliance Partners, a development team including Pacific Companies, SUDA and Resources for Community Development, to\nbuild 620 units at the Ashby station\n. And in El Cerrito, a joint venture between Holliday Development,\nRelated California\nand Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA) are planning a 750-unit mixed-income project slated for construction in five phases.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Marquette Companies is joining in on the action as the Chicago suburbs\u2019 multifamily market extends its hot streak.\nNaperville-based\nMarquette\nbought the 198-unit Arlington Lakes Apartments from Deerfield-based Orion Residential for $46 million. The deal came out to just over $232,000 per unit. Though it\u2019s unclear what Orion\u2019s total investment in the complex was, the firm took over the apartments via a quit claim deed in 2018 and took out a $27.9 mortgage against the property.\nThe sale of the property at 909 East Golf Road in\nArlington Heights\nwas also the result of the companies\u2019 recent partnership. Marquette and Orion announced earlier this month that the two firms would join some of their operations and that Orion executive Dan Gumbiner would serve as an adviser while Orion\u2019s senior vice president of asset management, Cheryl Charnas, would join Marquette\u2019s asset management team as executive vice president.\nNow that Marquette has purchased the Orion Arlington Lakes Apartments at 917 West Golf Road, the firm will step in as property manager, perform renovations and rebrand the property to Avery at Arlington Lakes.\nThe spreadout, 1985-built complex of garden style units has been consistently 97 percent occupied, said Jim Cunningham, president of Marquette Management.\nChicagoland\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well all year because the city didn\u2019t experience the same Covid-era building boom that caught on in some cities in the southeast and Sun Belt.\nA steady job market and low supply of new construction has drawn investors, especially in the suburbs where they don\u2019t have to contend with Chicago\u2019s political environment. But the Arlington Heights property still faces the downside of dealing with Cook County\u2019s unpredictable property tax system.\nAs a result, suburban properties bordering Cook County have seen the most interest and that has recently extended to more buyers looking at outer ring suburbs as well.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage Interra Realty found, and a few outer ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nOut of the metro area\u2019s total multifamily sales, the share of sales that took place in Kendall County was up 300 percent, and a whopping 550 percent in Will County, compared to the same time period last year, according to new analysis from Interra.\n",

        "content": "Onni Group is closing in on its second major Loop office bet, negotiating to buy the 50-story tower at 161 North Clark Street \u2014 a move that would plant the Vancouver developer directly across from Google\u2019s future Chicago headquarters.\nThe firm is in advanced talks to acquire the nearly 1.1 million-square-foot skyscraper from an affiliate of\nSociete Generale\n, which seized the property last year through a $237 million foreclosure, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing people familiar with the offering.\nIt would be\nOnni\u2019s\nsecond turnaround project in the heart of the Loop. The company recently overhauled\n225 West Randolph Street\n, rebranded as The Bell, and nearly filled it at a time when most downtown landlords are bleeding occupancy. A purchase of 161 North Clark would double down on its thesis that Google\u2019s redevelopment of the Thompson Center \u2014 set to finish next year \u2014 will pull foot traffic, talent and tenants deeper into the central Loop.\nThat halo effect is already visible. Firms have cited proximity to Google as a reason to sign leases nearby, and the Clark Street tower itself just landed law firm Wilson Elser in a 20,000-square-foot deal tied directly to the tech giant\u2019s arrival. CoStar pegs the building at almost 89 percent leased, well above the downtown average of 72 percent, buoyed in part by Cook County\u2019s 106,000-square-foot swing-space lease signed in 2022.\nThe price Onni is offering is unclear, but it will almost certainly reflect the brutal reset in downtown\u2019s office values. Societe Generale inherited the tower when its prior owners \u2014 a Korea Post-led venture advised by CBRE Investment Management \u2014 defaulted amid rising interest rates and collapsing workspace demand. A discount may force the bank to absorb a sizable loss on 161 North Clark Street, which last sold for roughly $331 million in 2013.\nSociete Generale initially signaled it would hold the tower long-term, boasting of new leasing momentum even as it hired\nEastdil Secured\nbrokers Bryan Rosenberg and David Caprile to shop the property. Onni\u2019s pursuit suggests a familiar pattern for the firm: buy distress, invest in modernization and ride a potential rebound, this one perhaps driven by the Thompson Center\u2019s next phase.\nOnni has become one of Chicago\u2019s most prolific developers, best known for its residential push in Fulton Market, River North and Goose Island, where it has more than 5,000 apartments proposed. But the firm also has deep Loop credentials, owning 200 North LaSalle Street since 2012.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The\nChicago area\nalso slipped in the firm\u2019s affordability index, ranking 39th out of the 50 largest metros. And the market\u2019s imbalance isn\u2019t easing anytime soon. Only 9,800 apartments are under construction \u2014 just 1.7 percent of total inventory \u2014 and fewer than 1,500 are expected to be delivered this year, according to CoStar.\nPrice tags at the One Chicago apartment complex for instance, located at 14 West Superior Street in River North, start around $2,700 a month, with three-bedrooms topping $13,000, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThose eye-watering prices aren\u2019t outliers anymore, as the city\u2019s supply of attainable housing is shrinking, testing the limits of Chicago\u2019s long-touted affordability edge.\nDemand is being stoked on multiple fronts. Americans are renting longer as the average first-time homebuyer hits 40, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. Elevated interest rates and economic churn make renting feel safer, and remote workers with six-figure salaries continue to arrive from New York, California, Florida and Texas. Many can comfortably afford Class A rent \u2014 and compared to the coasts, Chicago still looks like a deal.\nThat\u2019s especially true downtown.\nLuxury Living\n, a boutique residential brokerage, told the outlet that gross rents for the Class A market \u2014 about 28,500 units across 85 properties built since 2016 \u2014 climbed 6.3 percent in the third quarter to $3,228 a month. River North led the surge with a 13 percent jump, pushing average rents to $3,738. The typical luxury renter is making six figures, has been leasing for several years, and isn\u2019t in a hurry to buy, founder Aaron Galvin said.\nThe high-end boom isn\u2019t limited to the city.\nSuburban developers\nare rolling out luxury products aimed at downsizers and remote workers with deep pockets. One Winnetka on the North Shore has a waiting list for units renting from $7,000 to over $12,500, developer John Murphy told the outlet. Tight supply, pricey construction and a reshuffled office market are pushing demand\noutward\n.\nBut as the luxury tier balloons, the middle is evaporating. Chicago\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 older, unsubsidized units that rent below market \u2014 is disappearing. Two- and four-flats in neighborhoods like Lincoln Park and Lakeview are being scrapped for single-family homes; others in areas like Logan Square are trading hands, renovated and repriced.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an erosion of the low-cost rental supply, and that just means to the extent that renters need affordable housing, they\u2019re having a harder and harder time,\u201d Geoff Smith, executive director of DePaul University\u2019s Institute for Housing Studies, told the outlet.\nOwners of modest buildings say demand is so intense they raise rents without losing tenants. Silver Property Group\u2019s Ron Abrams likened it to \u201cshooting fish in a barrel\u201d at a recent real estate panel.\nChicago remains cheaper than New York or L.A., but rents are rising faster than wages. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows wage growth slowing and employment gains flattening. Zillow economist Orphe Divounguy warned that if that gap widens, Chicago\u2019s talent pipeline could feel the strain.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller of the White Rock Lake waterfront home, Darren Phillips, had originally listed the property in January of 2023 for $15.8 million and dropped the price several times since then.\nThe home\u2019s nearest competitor is a landmark estate dubbed Mount Vernon, the former home of H.L. Hunt and the most expensive listing of July. The replica of George Washington\u2019s home at 4009 West Lawther Drive has a price history similar to Haidar\u2019s purchase, having wobbled between $30 million and $15 million under the same ownership since 2012.\nHaidar co-founded the tech companies Dialexa, Vinli, Robin and Rosy, and he holds several patents. Born Mahmoud Haidar to a family of Lebanese refugees in Kuwait, he was selected in 2019 to be a Presidential Leadership Scholar, a collaborative recognition of the presidential centers of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Lyndon B. Johnson. The younger Bush painted Haidar\u2019s portrait for his book \u201cOut of Many, One: Portraits of America\u2019s Immigrants.\u201d\nAlthough the price threshold of ultra-luxury in Texas has risen considerably in the past few years,\nrelistings\nhave taken up a greater share of Texas ultra-luxury inventory in the latter half of 2025, and price cuts have become more common.\nThe three-story main house at 4231 West Law, meanwhile, includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a 2,700-square-foot basement with two wine cellars. It shares almost four acres with an eight-car garage, horse stables, a guest house and a cabana overlooking White Rock Lake, the lake nearest Downtown Dallas.\nCompass Real Estate agent Mark Godson had the listing when the property sold, though Frada Sandler of Dave Perry Miller was representing the seller in 2023, when it was the most expensive listing in Texas.\n",

Broker Salman Tabani of Tabani Realty first told the Dallas Morning News of the development.\nThe seller is TOG Hotels Downtown Dallas, tied to California-based TOG Hotels, owned by Terry Tognazzini, who has owned the property since 2007. The hotel, last valued at $17.15 million by the Dallas Central Appraisal District \u2014 a figure that often diverges widely from market pricing \u2014 is among downtown\u2019s older\nbranded assets\n. Built in 1969, the Crowne Plaza underwent more than $10 million in upgrades in 2020 aimed at keeping pace with newer competitors.\nThe last couple of years have brought unflattering attention.\u00a0 Last summer, ownership abruptly canceled the\nDaddyLand Festival\n, a gay music event booked at the hotel, and directed attendees to leave. The move came after hotel staff received guest complaints about the gay-themded event, reportedly from members of two collegiate sorority groups that were also holding events on the property at the time.\nThe hotel\u2019s ownership entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February of this year, a case Tabani said it expects to conclude this month. A restructuring brought in a new management company, Arizona-based Universal Hospitality Solutions, and a new general manager, Joseph Jennings.\nDespite the rough patches, buyer appetite for downtown Dallas hospitality assets hasn\u2019t dimmed. Earlier this year, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners paid roughly $111 million for the\nFairmont Dallas\n, a deal that signaled investor confidence in the city\u2019s convention-driven demand and its post-pandemic travel recovery.\nThe Crowne Plaza\u2019s proximity to the convention center \u2014 and to redevelopment efforts swirling around the southern edge of downtown \u2014 could bolster interest, even as rising operating expenses and softening business travel weigh on underwriting. FIFA will use the existing convention halls as its International Broadcast Center during the\nWorld Cup\nnext year all while developers work through the first phase of the project known as Inspire Dallas, a multibillion-dollar redevelopment of the convention center at 650 South Griffin Street.\nThe sale would represent a sizable step-up from its county appraisal and a reset for a hotel that\u2019s cycled through controversy, capital projects and operational shifts in just a few years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "HN Capital Partners is doubling down on the Design District, unveiling a slate of new restaurants and a fitness concept as it works to turn the eclectic showroom enclave into a round-the-clock neighborhood.\nThe Dallas-based firm is adding five eateries plus an indoor padel complex across its growing portfolio in the area, where it now owns roughly 40 acres at 1650 Oak Lawn Avenue, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Jo\u2019seon Wagyu Omakase, a Korean-Japanese fusion format, is slated to debut in early December. Delilah \u2014 the celebrity magnet born in Los Angeles \u2014 is expected to open within 60 days, potentially with a January splash. Ospi, La Lupita Taco &amp; Mezcal and Alara Modern Mediterranean will follow in stages through early 2026.\nVipin Nambiar, founder and managing partner of HN Capital Partners, told the outlet that he expects to announce a sixth restaurant in the coming weeks. HN Capital \u2014 along with McCort Partners \u2014 began amassing properties mostly within the\nDesign District\nfour years ago and now owns about 40 acres in the area Northwest of downtown.\nIt\u2019s a major jolt for a district with about 17 existing eateries and a widening profile among developers chasing Dallas\u2019 next creative cluster. HN won\u2019t say how much it\u2019s spending, though it notes that top-shelf concepts like Delilah run into the millions. The Dallas outpost will span about 15,000 square feet and host private and corporate events \u2014 a strategy modeled after the brand\u2019s Vegas location, where snagging a table can be a sport.\nThe strategy is \u201cthoughtful placemaking,\u201d Nambiar said, tapping into the district\u2019s artsy identity without sanding down its edge.\nAsana Partners\u2019\nnew open-air center, The Seam, is rising nearby, and HN\u2019s moves are designed to help stitch the area into a coherent all-day destination rather than a nighttime-only hotspot.\nLunchtime traffic is a big part of that equation, which helped put Ospi \u2014 an Italian-American concept from \u201cTop Chef\u201d alum Jackson Kalb \u2014 at the top of HN\u2019s list to backfill the shuttered Meddlesome Moth.\nHN is layering in recreation too.\nThe firm is bringing New York-based Padel Haus to a 24,000-square-foot warehouse on Dragon Street, aiming for a first-half 2026 opening.\nPadel\n, a racket sport played inside glass enclosures, hasn\u2019t matched pickleball in popularity yet, but Nambiar told the outlet that he believes it could surpass it, calling the club a mix of fitness and social glue for Uptown, Oak Lawn and Design District residents and office workers.\nThe new leases preview the scale of HN\u2019s ambitions. Last year the firm and McCourt Partners unveiled plans for\nHi Line Square\n, a two-tower project expected to break ground in early 2026 and reshape the district\u2019s skyline.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Other highlights included Miami condo dollar volume spiking by 18 percent, Broward single-family home dollar volume climbing by 13 percent, and Palm Beach total sales exploding by 22 percent, year-over-year.\n[TheRealDeal]\n$4.8 billion\nDemonstrating that the September report was no fluke, total dollar volume across the region in October 2025 showed a year-over-year increase of 14 percent. Key takeaways from this report include Miami single-family home dollar volume jumping by 14 percent, Broward condo closings rising by 11 percent, and Palm Beach single-family home sales leaping by 33 percent.\n[TheRealDeal]\n$1 million (and above)\nSingle-family home sales in this price range demonstrated remarkably different demand across the region\u2019s three counties in October. In Palm Beach, sales of $1 million-plus houses soared by 33.1 percent, with Miami not too far behind with a 27.2 percent increase. But Broward\u2019s luxury market struggled last month, as sales of homes in the price range declined by 2.3 percent.\n[SFBJ]\n426\nAt its current pace, the number of $10 million-plus home sales expected in South Florida for the calendar year. This number is just shy of the record of 444 set in 2021, when market conditions were dramatically altered by trends associated with the Covid pandemic.\n[MiamiHerald]\n100\nPercentage that Miami condo prices have increased since 2015. Despite that figure, this sector is still facing challenges, as median prices decreased 3.61 percent, year-over-year, from $415,000 to $400,000.\n[SouthFloridaAgentMagazine]\nThis column is produced by the Master Brokers Forum, a network of South Florida\u2019s elite real estate professionals where membership is by invitation only and based on outstanding production, as well as ethical and professional behavior.",

        "content": "Coldwell Banker Realty General Manager\nMatthew Clayman\nis making good on a promised recruiting ramp-up nearly four months into new gig overseeing the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices.\nThe brokerage announced five new agents to the Beverly Hills office, bringing with them sales of almost $95 million in the past 12 months. The brokerage said two additional agents also moved their licenses to Coldwell Banker but held off on naming their publicly. When counting all seven agents, the total production over the past 12 months for the incoming wave of recruits topped $150 million.\nClayman, the former broker of record and general manager of the\nBeverly Hills Estates\n, succeeded long-time Coldwell Banker Managing Broker Tom Dunlap in early August.\n\u201cI really want to focus on driving retention and recruitment, looking at top producers across the industry given my background and the number of brokerages I\u2019ve been at as an agent,\u201d Clayman told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of his appointment in discussing his goals in the first 90 days on the job.\nHere\u2019s a look at who Clayman recruited to Coldwell Banker, in addition to other recent local brokerage additions.\n\u27a4 Severin Braham is now with Coldwell Banker. Braham was formerly with the Beverly Hills Estates, where he served as director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group, a team helmed by the brokerage\u2019s founders Branden and Rayni Williams.\n\u27a4 Hannah Babitt made the move to Coldwell Banker from Rodeo Realty. Babitt cited Clayman as the reason for her joining the brokerage, with the two having once worked together in the music industry.\nBabitt also launched and is CEO of music management firm BABZ.\n\u27a4 Katy Johnson joined Coldwell Banker Realty from the Oppenheim Group, where she had been for a little over two years. The professional model runs a travel blog and also started a nonprofit called One Model Mission aimed at telling the stories of women from around the world.\n\u27a4 Former Hilton Hilton agent Mary Swanson is also now with Coldwell Banker. The move places her back under the same roof as Coldwell\u2019s top agent in the state,\nJade Mills\n, for whom Swanson was an assistant at the start of her real estate career.\n\u27a4 Myles Lewis, who holds licenses in California and Texas, was most recently with Compass before joining Coldwell Banker.\nHe joins with a music industry background, having served in senior executive roles at American Idol, BMI and Epic Records.\n\u27a4 Joseph Baena has moved his license over to\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\n. Baena, the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, was most recently with LPT Realty Inc. for about a year. He\u2019s also been with La Mesa Partners, Keller Williams R &amp; LS Investments and Marina Brokerage Partners since obtaining his license in 2021.\nBaena focuses on Santa Monica, Venice, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and other high-end markets in Los Angeles County.\nOutside of real estate, he also has a background in business, fitness and entertainment.\n\u27a4 Carl Gambino\u2019s Gambino Group at Compass added Sebastian Lorefice to its Los Angeles team with a focus on the Westside and broader L.A. real estate markets.\nLorefice joins after having served as a director of operations for two other teams. Before entering real estate, he was involved in corporate events for Hyatt Regency in Jersey City, New Jersey and then Newport Beach, Calif.\n",

        "content": "North Shore builder couple\nLeo and Milena Birov\nare setting an aspirational price on a Kenilworth spec mansion, which hit the market Monday asking $16.8 million.\nThe home is not yet built, but renderings and floor plans show the vision for a 17,000-square-foot house on the Kenilworth lakefront. The transitional-style house on a nearly one-acre lot will have seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms.\nThe listing advertises a refrigerated wine cellar, media room, wet bar and a four-car garage.\nIf sold for its asking price, it would be the most expensive home sale on record in Kenilworth. A historic six-bedroom, 8,280-square-foot mansion set the record for Kenilworth at\n$14.5 million last month\n.The home is being built by Heritage Luxury Homes, the North Shore homebuilder operated by the Birovs. Milena Birov is the listing agent on the home.\nAlthough it has yet to be developed, it\u2019s the second-priciest home listed now in the ritzy North Shore suburbs, after a Lake Forest estate seeking $27.5 million.\nLeo Birov told\nThe Real Deal\nhe\u2019s confident the home will reach its asking price, citing the $14.5 million sale at 219 Sheridan Road and the recent record-setting sale of an estate in Winnetka for $31.3 million. That record held until last week, when another\nWinnetka home closed for $32.5 million\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brand new construction, it\u2019s very different than 219 Sheridan,\u201d he said, noting that house was more than 100 years old. \u201cMy lot is much bigger too. I\u2019m very comfortable with this.\u201d\nThe house has a projected construction date of 2027, and Birov said he\u2019s in the process of obtaining permits for the house. The buyer will be able to make custom specifications on the details and finishes, Birov said.\nThe couple bought the original 1.6-acre property, which covered two parcels,\nfor $6.8 million in September\n. They split the parcels and are advertising a separate house for nearly $6 million on the smaller of the two parcels, which faces Sheridan Road and does not have lakefront access.\nThe home previously on the two lots was initially listed for $14 million in 2021, but went through several price cuts before closing at $6.8 million with the Birovs purchase.\nThe Birovs are frequent North Shore builders, having listed new construction homes in Kenilworth, Glencoe, Winnetka and Wilmette. In addition to the two Kenilworth homes, Heritage Luxury Homes is marketing another spec mansion in Glencoe asking $5.7 million.\nIn June, another home they developed in Glencoe sold for $4.7 million. Their sales in Wilmette include a $2 million home on Sunset Drive in 2024, as well as a 9,000-square-foot French Colonial on Michigan Avenue that fetched $4.8 million in 2022.\n",

        "content": "Another Union Square real estate deal is the latest sign of a potential\nrebirth of the neighborhood\n.\nSuitsupply bought the first two floors of retail space in the Grace Building at 166 Geary Street at a foreclosure auction for $19.6 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The menswear retailer has a 5,000-square-foot store in the building with a dedicated entrance one block over at 175\nMaiden Lane\n. The retail parcel had been in receivership since 2022.\nSuitsupply was already making real estate moves at the building prior to the acquisition. The Dutch fashion brand previously took on commercial mortgage-backed securities debt by buying the defaulted loan for the retail space from the mortgage trust that was given control of the building. The\nparcel\u2019s previous owner, the Jackson Group\n, bought the 12,907-square-foot retail space in 2014 for $46 million and was facing $38.5 million worth of CMBS debt before selling it.\nThe retail space was appraised at $26 million in 2016, but its value fell to $17.3 million last year. Suitsupply opened its flagship there in 2016 and continues to occupy 5,000 square feet of retail space. The apparel company also previously leased separate office space in the building; both the retail and office leases were slated to expire this May, but Suitsupply opted to pivot to a path to ownership. The building\u2019s top 14 floors of office space are tied to a separate loan and borrower than the retail parcel and acquired by a mortgage trust in June for $5.9 million.\nSuitsupply isn\u2019t the first retailer to become an owner in the Union Square area. In 2022,\nChanel bought the 340 Post Street building for $63 million\nwith plans to eventually move its San Francisco flagship there from its current home at 156 Geary Street next door to Suitsupply; Williams-Sonoma currently occupies the 340 Post building.\nSuitsupply has seemingly been venturing further into real estate acquisitions. Last month, prior to its purchase of the 166 Geary space, it formed the purchasing vehicle Suit Supply Real Estate San Francisco LLC. Earlier this year, it registered another entity, Suit Supply Real Estate Manchester Limited, in the U.K.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Old Parkland\nhas long been whispered about in Dallas finance circles as the place where the big checks get written.\nThe home of that mystique is growing: developer Harlan Crow has added three new office buildings to the 16-building compound, which now features 842,000 square feet of office space, reinforcing Old Parkland\u2019s status as the most elite address in North Texas wealth.\nBloomberg\nchronicled\nthe phenomenon, describing a setting at 3819 Maple Avenue near Reverchon Park that leans more Ivy League campus than office park, complete with manicured oaks, marble-clad and wood-paneled interiors as well as enough artifacts to fill a small museum.\nCrow\n, heir to the influential Trammell Crow real estate dynasty, has decorated the property with dinosaur eggs, presidential portraits and even a replica surgical amphitheater. Former President George W. Bush keeps an office on-site. Prospective tenants don\u2019t apply \u2014 they\u2019re invited, and often personally recruited.\nThe expansion comes as Dallas chases higher-end office demand.\nGoldman Sachs\nis building a $500 million campus,\nBank of America\nis adding a new tower and the\nregion\u2019s finance jobs\nnow outnumber those in Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBut trophy space is still hard to come by. Family offices and private equity shops want exclusivity without the sprawl, and Old Parkland \u2014 where\nCrow Holdings\nis headquartered in a restored 1913 hospital campus \u2014 charges some of the highest rents in the city. Even so, the new East Campus is reportedly 80 percent leased, and the\nNYSE just grabbed 28,000 square feet\nfor its Texas operation.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Old Parkland\u2019s draw goes beyond polish. The property hosts roughly 450 lectures and debates a year in its underground chamber, attracting everyone from Joe Biden to Rahm Emanuel to Karl Rove. For Austin-based founder Matt Weiss, a single lunch inside led to \u201ca couple million\u201d in commitments for his AI startup and a stack of new contacts. Other tenants say the address alone signals a level of access, noting amenities that verge on the theatrical, such as a parking garage that pipes in classical music.\nCrow, now more focused on politics than development, still shapes the campus culture. The selective roll-out of new buildings and the slow-burn leasing strategy aim to preserve the project\u2019s country-club aura, a rarity in the wider Dallas office market where vacancies hover around 25 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Rivani lives in Miami\u2019s Morningside and purchased the home as an investment.\nThe seller is Tom Sullivan, the founder and CEO of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee-based Lumber Liquidators, records show. Sullivan\ninked the contract\nto sell the 0.8-acre property in October.\nThe six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom house was listed with Venetian International\u2019s Luis Bosch, asking $24.9 million. It hit the market in December for $27.9 million, and was previously listed in 2021 for $32.5 million.\nDina Goldentayer of Douglas Elliman represented Rivani. She is also listing the house for rent, asking $79,500 a month.\nThe house was built in 1930, and previously sold for $11.5 million in 2008, records show. The lot has 220 feet of water frontage that can fit a yacht of up to 205 feet, according to a press release from Rivani\u2019s firm.\nPalm Island is one of Miami Beach\u2019s gated islands that\u2019s attracted ultra-luxury buyers seeking privacy and security. In March, gaming mogul Richard Skelhorn paid a record\n$45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue, making it the most expensive home ever sold on the island.\nRivani has bought and sold a handful of properties this year. In September, the firm sold the commercial condo leased to Michael Schwartz\u2019s Amara at Paraiso restaurant in Miami\u2019s Edgewater to a Chicago real estate investor\nfor $19.8 million\n.\nIn August, his firm paid\n$37 million\nto acquire the Lincoln Theatre, a historic Art Deco building at 551 Lincoln Road in Miami Beach.

        "content": "Famed hotelier Steve Wynn\ncontinues to drop the price on his Beverly Hills mansion.\nThe Wynn Resorts founder slashed the list price of his home at 1210 Benedict Canyon Drive to $65 million, Mansion Global\nreported\n. It now returns to a previous asking price from a year ago, still higher than the $48.7 million Wynn paid for it in 2015.\nWynn first started shopping the property around off-market in 2020 for $135 million, officially\nlisted it in 2021\nfor $115 million and repeatedly lowered the price in the years since, getting down to $65 million last year and\nreturning to market earlier this year for $75 million\nbefore now reverting back to last year\u2019s listing price. The current listing price marks a more than 50 percent reduction from its original 2020 figure.\nThe property spans roughly 27,000 square feet on a 2.7-acre compound. Longtime Wynn Resorts collaborator Roger Thomas designed the interiors of the mansion, part of a full renovation of the property that included landscape work from designer Robert Truskowski.\nThe main house boasts 11 bedrooms, including four ensuite guest rooms, a lanai suite with its own veranda, and separate living space for staff and security. Inside, there is a wellness suite, a private cinema, a wine-tasting room and a great room featuring retractable glass walls with views of the city. Outside, residents and guests have access to a tennis court complete with an air-conditioned viewing pavilion, a pool house and a garage and carport space capable of holding 26 vehicles.\nIn 2022, Wynn listed five of his properties from coast to coast\nfor a combined $300 million\n. That included the previous listing of the Beverly Hills estate as well as his Central Park South duplex in New York City for $90 million; two abodes in Sun Valley, Idaho for $27 million; and a Palm Beach property for $78.5 million. The Palm Beach home sold for $66 million, and he followed it up in the area with a\n$12.9 million waterfront teardown purchase\nin West Palm Beach last December.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Newport Beach residents are going to get a say in their city\u2019s state-approved housing plan and choose whether to slash the number of homes slated to rise in the ritzy coastal enclave.\nThe initiative is headed to the November 2026 ballot after former Mayor Marshall \u201cDuffy\u201d Duffield and local organizations collected nearly 9,000 signatures for the measure that would scrap the city\u2019s current housing plan in favor of one that cuts its planned housing capacity by more than half, Voice of OC\nreported\n. The city council unanimously voted to put the so-called Responsible Housing Initiative on the ballot next fall at its meeting last week.\nUnder the proposed plan, Newport Beach would have to zone for 2,900 new homes as opposed to more than 8,000 as part of its current housing element. Of the 2,900, 2,160 would be set aside for low- and very-low-income families; the rest would come mostly from other housing projects already in the works.\nNewport Beach, like every city in California, is under pressure to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation; it was assigned more than 4,800 homes by 2029, including more than 2,300 for low- and very-low-income households. Officials ultimately approved a plan that nearly doubled the required capacity,\nclaiming\nthe extra buffer was needed because not every project delivers affordable units, thereby \u201callowing for market-rate units to help support and subsidize the creation of\naffordable housing\n.\u201d\nIf voters give the go-ahead next November, the\nCity of Newport Beach\ncould face off against state housing officials in court. Meanwhile, in neighboring Huntington Beach, city council members continue to challenge their own state-mandated housing quotas in court; a federal\nappeals court declined to hear the city\u2019s challenge\nearlier this year.\nSupporters of the Responsible Housing Initiative believe city leaders ignored the voter-approved Greenlight Initiative, a voter-approved law from 2000 that requires public approval for major changes to the city\u2019s general plan. Opponents argue that state law supersedes local measures \u2014 a position supported by an Orange County Superior Court judge who rejected lawsuits last year seeking to force a citywide vote. In addition, detractors like Councilman Noah Blom believe the initiative is a developer-driven effort to kneecap competitors, calling out\nbuilder Ken Picerne\nas the endeavor\u2019s primary funder.\n\u201cWe were first told that you would comply with [the Greenlight Initiative], of the city charter by allowing us to vote on the housing plan, but after two years and at the last minute, you reversed course, claiming that California law barred a local vote,\u201d former councilmember Jeff Herdman said at last week\u2019s meeting. \u201cYou\u2019re also improperly interfering with our constitutional rights to control the destiny of our community.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The building is part of Tower Plaza, a five-building complex including the 12-story office structure, that\nTourbineau bought from TPG Real Estate Trust\nin June for $22 million total.\nThe entire property spans 202,014 square feet, though the 12-story office tower is the only building at the complex planned for conversion. The remaining four one- to two-story office buildings will stay open and continue operating as they do now.\nTourbineau\u2019s purchase of the 3.4-acre property marked the firm\u2019s first acquisition in San Mateo. At the time, it was floating various mixed-use reimaginings of the complex, including apartments and hotel uses. The company viewed the property as \u201can empty slate,\u201d CIO Ben Wong\ntold\nthe San Francisco Business Times. \u201cThis was the one [property] we were most excited about.\u201d In June, Tower Plaza was nearly 80 percent vacant \u2014 a sign of the Bay Area\u2019s\nhigh post-pandemic office vacancy rate\nas companies downsized or went remote entirely.\nTourbineau plans to build studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments averaging 553 square feet. Of the 156 units, 15 percent will be set aside for income-restricted housing. Residents at the building will have access to amenities like a lounge, a gym and landscaped courtyards. It will also get an architectural makeover including a new modern facade with energy-efficient window systems. TCA Architects is handling designs for the project.\nTPG Real Estate Trust, the former lender for the complex,\nseized the property last year\nafter previous owner\nRialto Capital Management\ndefaulted on a $75.8 million loan. The $22 million sale price marked a 71 percent drop from the $77.3 million Rialto paid for it in 2019.\nEarlier this year, Tourbineau\nbroke into another new market \u2014 Nashville\n\u2014 with similar conversion plans.

The vote will take place on Dec. 2, Miami Dade College President Madeline Pumariega said.\nEarlier this month, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz temporarily blocked the college from conveying the land to the state as a result of a lawsuit filed last month by historian and activist\nMarvin Dunn\n.\nIn his complaint, Dunn alleged trustees violated Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law by failing to clearly disclose which parcel was on the line and that it was intended for Trump\u2019s presidential library when they unanimously approved the transfer on Sept. 23. Gov.\nRon DeSantis\nand the Florida Cabinet subsequently voted to give the property to the foundation spearheading the presidential library project, which is led by\nEric Trump\n, one of the president\u2019s sons, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley.\nRuiz had also recently set a trial date for August. Faced with the prospect of a monthslong court battle, board chair Michael Bileca told the Miami Herald it made more sense to hold a new vote than remain tied up in litigation.\nValued at about $67 million by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser, the 3-acre parcel is one of the few remaining undeveloped sites in downtown Miami. Real estate analysts said the property \u2014 surrounded by luxury condo towers, two museums and two waterfront parks \u2014 could fetch several times its assessed value if sold on the open market.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

The homes that went pending last week total $271.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 120 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 29 contracts totaling $235 million in asking dollar volume, up from 10 contracts and $67.7 million.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 58 new listings, and a total of 1,198 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 17 were single-family homes and 13 were condos. The average asking price for the condos is $5.5 million, or $2,138 per square foot. They spent an average of 117 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes is $11.7 million, and they spent an average of 123 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to go pending last week is the 10,500-square-foot mansion at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard in Manalapan, asking $84.9 million. Records show the sellers are Frank and Dolores Mennella, who bought the 1.9-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal property for $7.5 million in 2018. Frank Mennella heads Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania-based Valley Tools &amp; Plastics, a natural gas distributor, according to Buzzfile.\nThe Mennellas are frequent investors in Palm Beach County luxury real estate. In February, they paid\na record $48 million\nfor a mansion in Jupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club. In 2023, they sold an oceanfront Manalapan estate for\n$48.4 million\n. In this latest Manalapan deal, the mansion built in 2022 has six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa facilities, a theater, game room, craft room, two bowling alleys, a dock and a tunnel to the beach.\nThey listed it for $84.9 million in May, Zillow shows. Philip Lyle Smith and Carla Ferreira-Smith with Luxury Resort Portfolio have the listing.\nThe next most expensive home to find a buyer is unit 1704 at the Bristol at 1100 South Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach, asking $17.8 million.

City National Bank is the lender, with participant Abanca.\nPebb, led by Ian Weiner, and BH Group are redeveloping the 29-acre campus, marking continuing repurposing of suburban office campuses in South Florida. The property, commonly known as Office Depot\u2019s headquarters because the retail giant is based there, has been rebranded as The Eclipse.\nBerkadia\u2019s Scott Wadler and Michael Basinski arranged the financing.\nPebb and BH are preserving and renovating two existing office buildings, which span a combined 405,000 square feet, and are building out a pair or outparcels, including with 21,500 square feet of retail and restaurant space. The outparcels also will have a\n37,000-square-foot Equinox\n.\nOffice tenants include\nAtlantic Pacific Companies\n,\nKanner &amp; Pintaluga\nand MN8 Energy. ODP Corporation, Office Depot\u2019s parent company, sold Pebb and BH Group the campus in 2023 for\n$104 million,\nand leased back a portion of the office space.\nTo replace the third office building, Pebb and BH are partnering with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group on a planned eight-story, 500-unit apartment building. Related bought the 10-acre multifamily development site for\n$50 million\nin July. The trio scored\nfinal approval\nfor the project in February.\nBH Group has emerged as a prolific South Florida developer and investor over the past three years. In February, it paid\n$83 million\nfor the 10-story, 338-unit waterfront apartment complex at 7501 and 7525 East Treasure Drive in North Bay Village. It partnered with Mast Capital on the\n$20-plus million\nbulk condo buyout for the majority of units at the aging Bayshore Park at 2545 South Bayshore Drive in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove, with plans to redevelop it into a luxury condominium.\nPebb, BH and Related are partnering on other projects.

        "content": "New York City may be ready to reclaim a\ncontroversial piece of its past\nas a tool for its present housing emergency.\nOn Tuesday, Council member Erik Bottcher introduced a bill \u2014 backed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development \u2014 that would once again allow construction of single-room occupancy units as small as 100 square feet, the New York Times\nreported\n. Such units typically omit private kitchens and bathrooms and rely on shared facilities.\nThe proposal would also make it simpler to convert office buildings into these micro units.\nCity officials argue S.R.O.s and other shared housing can be delivered fast and cheap enough to meet demand from single adults, newcomers to the city and people exiting homelessness. In neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill, shared rooms with communal kitchens can rent for $1,500 or below, compared with median rents well north of $3,000.\nOfficials point to shifting household patterns as part of the rationale: single-person households rose almost 9 percent between 2018 and 2023 and nonfamily households grew more than 11 percent over the same period.\nBut others have pointed to the perception S.R.O. units have had in the city as sites of crime, drugs, overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.\nThe legislation speaks to this and would not resurrect the flophouses of a century ago; it sets operational and safety standards \u2014 for example, limiting kitchens or bathrooms to serve no more than three units, requiring sprinklers and mandating minimum electrical capacity \u2014 and would attempt to bring co-living operators out of a largely unregulated gray market.\n\u201cThese are not yesterday\u2019s S.R.O.\u2019s,\u201d Bottcher said, pitching modern, well-managed shared housing as a pragmatic addition to the city\u2019s housing stock.\nThe measure places New York alongside global peers like London, Zurich and Seoul, which have experimented with compact shared housing. City Council banned the construction of new S.R.O.s in 1955. Today, there are approximately 30,000 to 40,000 S.R.O. units in New York City, less than half of what existed in the early 20th century, according to the NYU Furman Center.\nIf enacted, the policy could free up larger units by legalizing smaller alternatives, offer lower-cost options for a growing cohort of single households and reshape how the city thinks about density.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Lenders poured billions into Manhattan office towers in October, originating almost $4 billion in CMBS debt.\nFive office towers landed the month\u2019s largest financing deals, led by a pair of trophy towers owned by Brookfield Properties. Both loans \u2014 for\n5 Manhattan West at Hudson Yards\nand\n660 Fifth Avenue in Midtown\n\u2014 cleared the billion-dollar mark.\nLenders leaned heavily on trophy assets with strong tenancy, recent renovations and deep-pocketed owners. Other deals ranged from CMBS loans backing Class A towers to an owner-originated loan that helped facilitate a major Midtown acquisition.\nHere are more details.\nManhattan West windfall | $1.25B | Hudson Yards\nCiti Real Estate Funding, Bank of Montreal, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Societe Generale\noriginated a $1.25 billion CMBS loan for Brookfield Properties\u2019 5 Manhattan West, a 1.7 million-square-foot trophy office tower at 450 W. 33rd Street. The loan matures in five years and has a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The 16-story building, which has undergone major renovations, is part of Brookfield\u2019s five-building Manhattan West megaproject. The development also includes two other office buildings, a retail building, a garden and plaza, and a 62-story, 844-unit residential tower called the Eugene. Tenants include Amazon and JPMorgan Chase, which opted to\ntriple its space\nat the property back in 2017. Whole Foods also leases 60,000 square feet of retail space at the property.\nTower turnaround | $1.21B | Midtown\nCiti Real Estate, Barclays, ING Capital, Bank of America and Santander Bank\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan for Brookfield Properties\u2019 recently redeveloped office tower at 660 Fifth Avenue. The lenders also provided an $89.4 million mezzanine loan, per Morningstar, which appraised the 1.3 million-square-foot, 39-story trophy tower at nearly $2 billion. The interest-only CMBS loan has a two-year term with three one-year extension options. Proceeds will go toward repaying\nprevious debt\n, including a $750 million loan from ING Group and a $300 million mezzanine loan from Apollo Global Management. Brookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 1950s building, formerly known as\n666 Fifth Avenue\n.\nLiberty loan | $900M | Financial District\nJPMorgan Chase, German American Capital and Goldman Sachs\noriginated a $900 million CMBS loan for Fosun International\u2019s 28 Liberty, a 2.1 million-square-foot office tower in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District. The refi follows a 140,000-square-foot lease expansion by Stripe that helped bring the property to 93 percent occupancy. The three-year loan refinances $895 million in existing debt. Fosun, which bought the former Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725 million in 2013, will contribute $78 million in fresh equity to close the transaction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 2 million-square-foot property was recently appraised at $1.35 billion. Tenants have inked 14 new lease deals totaling 438,000 square feet since early 2024 at the building once hobbled by high vacancy after losing\nMilbank to Hudson Yards\n, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nMidtown momentum | $570M | Times Square\nJPMorgan Chase, German American Capital and Wells Fargo Bank\noriginated a $507 million CMBS loan for 11 Times Square, a 40-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office and retail building owned by A joint venture of PGIM Real Estate, Norges Bank Investment Management and SJP Properties. The two-year, floating-rate, interest-only loan has three one-year extension options, according to Fitch. The landlords will chip in $42.8 million in equity. The 2011 building is about 87 percent occupied, according to Fitch. Tenants include law firm Proskauer Rose and Microsoft. Last year, British company PATH Entertainment Group inked a 50,000-square-foot lease for a long-vacant retail space, where it\u2019s planning to open an immersive experience.\nNorges notch | $372M | Times Square\nA joint venture between Norges Bank Investment Management and Beacon Capital Partners\nprovided a $372 million loan for their own purchase of 1177 Sixth Avenue. The JV bought the 47-story, 1 million-square-foot office building for $571 million from Silverstein Properties and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. Norges \u2014 a sovereign wealth fund for Norway\u2019s government pensioners \u2014\u00a0 is taking a 95 percent ownership interest, while Beacon is picking up the remaining stake. The deal for the building breaks down to $571 per square foot. Incoming ownership is expected to maintain the property as an office building.\n",

        "content": "Readers have been sending me examples of bureaucratic city rules that waste time and money. Here\u2019s one that has persisted for decades: HPD\u2019s annual property registration.\nAs the treasurer of a small condominium, I have been doing this annoying task for 30 years \u2014 and it still hasn\u2019t been digitized.\nAs multifamily owners and property managers know, the form is online and is populated with the information from the previous year, which is helpful. But here\u2019s the problem: You have to print it, sign it and mail it in. What the heck?\nHPD\u2019s technology is decades behind. In 1969, NASA engineers on Earth could chat with astronauts on the moon. Today, someone on a street corner can FaceTime a climber on the summit of Mount Everest. Yet HPD is still using paper for property registrations.\nThat means mail by the truckload is still being dumped at the agency\u2019s doorstep and physically opened by city employees. Perhaps these millions of signed documents are being digitized and shredded, but my guess is the city leases storage space for them.\nNot only does that waste time and money, but every so often, a fire erupts and irreplaceable records are\nincinerated\n. But the main problem is the inconvenience for multifamily owners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t upload it like other things \u2014 check, check, check, e-sign and you\u2019re done,\u201d said David Eshaghoff, a Great Neck-based owner of rental buildings in Washington Heights and Hamilton Heights.\nAdding insult to injury, for the privilege of mailing in registration forms, owners must pay $13 per property. At one time, they had to pay by check. The lone innovation that I can recall in three decades of filing is that the $13 can now be paid by autopay, like property taxes.\nWhat happens if you forget to sign or miss the deadline to mail the form to HPD? You end up \u201cspending hours dealing with them because they don\u2019t respond to emails or phone calls,\u201d one landlord told me via LinkedIn. \u201cIt is awful and pointless.\u201d\nSkipping the process is not an option, Eshaghoff said, because if a building\u2019s registration is not current, violations cannot be cleared.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDoes using contractors with higher-paid construction workers pay for itself? It\u2019s a crucial question for projects using 485x, with its wage floor for 100-or-more-unit projects. Developer Eli Lever has done the math and his answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that often (but not always) these firms may produce a higher quality build in a shorter timeline, going from 15 months to 12 months on a $40 million total deal might save $1 million or so in interest payments,\u201d he said by email. \u201cThe additional cost to build with prevailing wages is multiples of that.\u201d\nAdd in the compliance costs of building a 485x project with more than 99 units and it\u2019s easy to see why few are being done. The difference is less glaring in expensive neighborhoods, Lever noted, but there, condo developers \u2014 who don\u2019t use 485x and have no affordability requirements \u2014 tend to outbid rental developers for sites.\nSend thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: About 15 percent of positions at the city\u2019s housing agencies are said to be vacant, but I suspect it\u2019s higher because the city\u2019s hiring process is even\nmore insane than I thought\n.\nFor civil service positions, even if an applicant can figure out what the obscure job titles mean and how to apply, it can take about a year to get through the process. A former employee for DCAS, the city\u2019s administrative agency, told me this cannot be fixed without cooperation from the unions. Zohran Mamdani should junk the whole system and start from scratch.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA longtime critic of New York City\u2019s real estate industry\ncomplained on X\nthat Zohran Mamdani appointed Jed Walentas, chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, to his transition team\u2019s\nhousing committee\n. Her issue was that Walentas heads a lobbying group.\nI\nreplied\nthat everyone on the transition team is an advocate for something.\nFor a completely unbiased transition team, the incoming mayor would have to appoint only newborns. Between feedings and nap time, they would have little time to accomplish anything.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$26.5 million\nfor a 6,618-square-foot condominium unit at 520 West 28th Street in Chelsea. The Hudson Advisory Team at Compass\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $88.6 million for 205 East 42nd Street in Grand Central. The Durst Organization sold the property to David Werner Real Estate. The three transactions included the\nfee title transfer,\nthe condo units\ngoing to one company and\nanother deed\nfor part of the condos going to two entities.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.25 million\nfor a 2,619-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 520 Fifth Avenue in Midtown. Corcoran Sunshine has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 108,838-square-foot, 29-unit, mixed-use project at 31 Church Avenue in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects filed the permit. The property is tied to Ben Tyberg.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Meadows is facing a drought.\nThe office complex in Rutherford, New Jersey, has taken a 30 percent valuation cut in the last decade \u2014 from $128 million to $90 million, according to Morningstar Credit. The property entered special servicing in May and the servicer said it recently initiated the foreclosure process.\nThe owner, commercial real estate investment firm\nAmerican Landmark Properties\n, has requested a modification of the loan, according to information provided to Morningstar.\nThe office market in north and central New Jersey hasn\u2019t recovered from its pandemic-era dive as firms\nembrace hybrid work and pursue Class A space\n.\nAmerican Landmark purchased the two-building complex at 201 Route 17 North for $125.2 million in 2015, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company took out a senior loan for $92 million from LCF and $12 million in mezzanine debt from Harbor Group International, according to Morningstar. The senior loan matured in September.\nBut by 2018, the complex\u2019s largest tenant, Malo Consulting, had defaulted on its lease. Malo, which operated a medical facility at the office complex, had taken up about 12 percent of the leasable area. That put the Meadows on its servicer\u2019s watchlist.\nThen revenue dipped precipitously during the pandemic \u2014 from $16.6 million when the loan was written to just $11.9 million in 2020, according to Morningstar Credit. Things picked back up but by 2024 numbers were trending in the wrong direction. Occupancy fell to 83 percent that year as net operating income dropped to $7.2 million from $8.6 percent nine years earlier.\nAmerican Landmark focuses mostly on office investments, and owned Chicago\u2019s Willis Tower from 2004 to 2015. Yisroel Gluck, a principal at American Landmark who is listed as the sponsor of the loan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMost recently, the office complex is occupied by several smaller firms, with none leasing more than 9 percent of the total area. The biggest tenant, according to Morningstar, is the American arm of Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido, which owns its titular brand, as well as NARS and Drunk Elephant.\nOther major tenants include United Healthcare Service and the headquarters of tutoring chain Kumon. The office space is nearby the Meadowlands Sports Complex, home to the Giants and Jets and\nthe American Dream mall\n, the debt-laden megamall concept by the\nGhermezian family\u2019s Triple Five Group\n.\nThe office market in north and central New Jersey has slowed in recent years, according to a\nreport\nfrom Colliers International. The vacancy rate in the region has ticked up since the beginning of 2022, and currently stands at about 25 percent. The high availability is expected to remain, although 2025 may see the sector\u2019s first positive net absorption since 2019, Colliers analysts wrote.\n",

        "content": "Rudin\u2019s Midtown East\nconversion\nis getting a shot in the arm, courtesy of both a construction loan and the arrival of an equity partner.\nThe developer is nearing a $350 million recapitalization of 845 Third Avenue, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The financing will aid the conversion process, for which Rudin filed plans with the city a couple of months ago.\nBDT &amp; MSD Partners are set to provide a $250 million construction loan to Rudin. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani negotiated the loan.\nAdditionally, Idan Ofer\u2019s Quantum Pacific paid $80 million for a stake in the project, first reported by\nPincusCo\n, making the company a 75 percent equity partner. Overall, the recapitalization is well above the $222 million Rudin was seeking in financing, according to an offering memorandum.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Doug Harmon and Josh King arranged the recapitalization. All of the parties involved in the transaction declined to comment to the Observer.\nRudin filed plans in September to turn the 21-story Manhattan office into a 411-unit apartment building. There will also be 9,100 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and residential amenities like a party room, a gym, a spa, a sauna, a plunge pool, media rooms and coworking spaces.\nThe conversion is expected to cost approximately $41.7 million. It\u2019s also expected to utilize the\n467m tax abatement program\n, meaning 25 percent of the units would be set aside as affordable housing.\nConstruction is expected to begin in the first quarter once Rudin clears the office tenants from the property. Work is expected to wrap in the third quarter of 2027.\nThe conversion has been on tap for years. As of early last year, the 1963-built property had more than 100,000 square feet of available space and hadn\u2019t seen a lease signed in nearly 24 months.\nThe firm\ndidn\u2019t immediately\npursue its conversion plan because the project didn\u2019t pencil out, but the math changed with the City of Yes rezoning, which allowed for added floors.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is a financing tool that encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. Alexandra Cooley, CEO and chief investment officer of Nuveen Green Capital, said in the release that C-PACE offers \u201clow-cost, long-term financing and structuring flexibility.\u201d The $235 million C-PACE financing marks the largest of its kind in Florida, she said in the release.\nJEM is a planned 67-story tower at 1016 Northeast Second Avenue in downtown Miami. It calls for 259 condos, 530 apartments, about 3,300 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a parking garage.\nPeggy Olin\u2019s OneWorld Properties is leading condo sales, which include a recently signed $8 million contract for a sky villa, according to the release.\nConstruction began in April 2024, and workers have surpassed the sixth floor of construction.

        "content": "TGS Management is teeing up an eyebrow-raising office play in Orange County in the form of a low-density corporate compound in the Irvine Spectrum district.\nThe Fred Taylor-led quantitative hedge fund filed plans with the City of Irvine for a 207,395-square-foot office building on a 42-acre site north of the I-5 Freeway, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. The firm\nbought the agricultural parcel\nnorth of Barranca Parkway from a FivePoint Holdings affiliate in 2023 for $240 million, marking one of the priciest land deals in the region. The new project is expected to push the firm\u2019s total investment past $300 million.\nThe development has seemingly been in the works for years. Taylor formed Barranca Properties LLC, the entity controlling the land and leading development, in 2021.\nThe new offices will nearly double TGS\u2019 current office space, an entire 115,000-square-foot building at the\nIrvine Company\n\u2019s Spectrum Terrace office campus. The new office building is expected to rise two stories with one level of subterranean parking. The property is slated to feature amenities like a skate park, apool and sport courts as well as a 14,335-square-foot private recreation center.\nStill, the proposed campus will be notably low-density compared to other office campuses including its current\nSpectrum Terrace\nhome. Buildings are expected to cover 6.5 percent of the site, while a maximum of 65 percent is allowed. About two-thirds of the property is expected to hold landscaping, going far beyond the minimum 15 percent site coverage requirement for foliage.\nTGS\u2019 digs at Spectrum Terrace are similarly fenced off from other buildings at the campus. That facility has amenities like a rock-climbing wall, private gym and kitchen area for the approximately 100 employees that use the current offices there. That headcount is about one-fifth of the employee density that offices of that size typically can hold.\nTGS hasn\u2019t been focused entirely on expansion, however. Last year, TGS\nsold off two office buildings\nat 1 and 3 Banting in Irvine to Bridge Industrial for $60 million. TGS previously planned to redevelop the 165,000 square feet of vacant office space into a distribution complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It has four beds and five baths across 3,823 square feet.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Nick Segal has the listing.\nProperty records show the seller is a trust tied to a woman named Anne K. Costin.\nA total of 15 homes went into contract last week in L.A. County. That was good for $79.7 million in asking volume, which was off about 49 percent from the year-ago period.\nEven still, actual closings across single-family homes and condominiums were up year-over-year in the third quarter, according to Multiple Listing Service data compiled by\nWestside Estate Agency\n.\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, volume of sold L.A. County homes of $4 million or more totaled $3.9 billion, according to Westside Estate Agency. That\u2019s a jump of nearly 25 percent from a year ago. That volume was across 497 properties, which was also up 21 percent from the number of deals a year earlier.\nThe median closing price in the quarter ticked up 2.1 percent from a year ago to $5.5 million.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s MLS hit back at Zillow\u2019s accusation that a Private Listing Network can pave an avenue for racial discrimination, accusing Zillow of weaponizing fair housing concerns to protect business interests.\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED)\n, which runs the MLS, said Zillow\u2019s recently publicized research was motivated by profit and protecting the online home search giant\u2019s access to listings. MRED dismissed the\nZillow analysis\nthat found listings on the MLS\u2019s private network were more than twice as common in majority white neighborhoods than majority non-white neighborhoods.\n\u201cZillow\u2019s approach in Illinois and its recent criticism of MRED\u2019s PLN appears to be driven less by data and more by a cynical strategic objective: securing control over listing distribution to protect its revenue,\u201d MRED said in the statement, which was also sent as an email to MLS members.\nThe MLS pointed to an internal document recently made public as part of Zillow\u2019s\ncourt case with Compass\n.\nThe document, authored in December 2024 and shared widely by Compass CEO Robert Reffkin, detailed Zillow\u2019s plans for enforcing public listings and punishing brokers and brokerages who advertise off-market listings in the event that the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy is rolled back. Among other strategies the document outlined, it detailed Zillow\u2019s plan to \u201cmobilize local and national organizations to publicly warn brokers and agents on the fair housing risks of reduced access to real estate information.\u201d\nZillow has been blasting\nMRED\u2019s Private Listing Network\n\u2014 which allows sellers to show their homes to all the agents in MRED\u2019s network while keeping them off public channels like Zillow\u00a0 \u2014since the company introduced its new Listing Access Standards earlier this year. The standards would block listings that were previously on the private network from appearing on Zillow, but Zillow hasn\u2019t yet begun enforcing them in the Chicago market. Zillow argued in its analysis last week that private listings cloud the market and deepen segregation in Chicago.\nA Zillow spokesperson said the company document referenced by MRED, which was labeled \u201coutdated as of 12/17/2024\u201d was \u201ccreated as a scratch pad by a few employees in December 2024 but quickly sunset\u201d because the business changed course and began developing its listing standards. The Zillow spokesperson said MRED should consider \u201cif there are unintended consequences to your practices that are leaving buyers of color out in the cold in the Chicago market.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see defensiveness when the data is so clear that this practice is continuing Chicago\u2019s long and sad history of a segregated housing market,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nPrivate listings key to marketing strategy\nThe fight between Chicago\u2019s MLS and the home search giant comes\namid a court battle\nin Compass\u2019 lawsuit against Zillow over the listing standards. In Chicago, the Private Listing Network is a crucial part of the three-phased marketing for Compass at the center of that lawsuit.\nIn the Chicago market, 45 percent of listings this year by Compass agents started out as office exclusives, Regional Vice President Fran Broude told\nThe Real Deal\nin a recent interview. Of those listings, 87 percent end up on the Private Listing Network. If sellers don\u2019t accept an offer during those private periods, the listings generally then go public.\nBut properties that do sell during the private marketing period essentially cut Zillow out of the equation and prevent consumers who aren\u2019t already working with an agent from seeing the homes are available.\nThe frequency varies from agent to agent, and sellers have the final say on how their property gets listed. Broude said the popularity of private listings among Compass clients shows that sellers view them as a valuable way to test pricing and market their homes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re choosing to pre-market their properties and find out as a seller what their options are, from what their needs are, through our private exclusives,\u201d she said.\nCompass has defended its private listing strategy from fair housing critiques, noting that consumers who search on the Compass website are told when there are exclusive listings that match their search \u2014 though consumers have to contact a Compass agent or visit an office to see those listings.\nFair housing advocate questions MLS system\nAs Zillow and MRED trade attacks about the scale of the problem, an Illinois fair housing advocate said he has been worrying for years about the threats private listings pose.\n\u201cI have had this unshakeable, deep concern that this migration toward more and more private listing networks will just create a new age of redlining,\u201d said\nMichael Chavarria\n, executive director of Wheaton-based HOPE Fair Housing Center.\nAlthough brokers have equal access to listings in MRED\u2019s private network, Chavarria said the system is still unfair because it keeps the listings out of sight of potential buyers who haven\u2019t started working with an agent. About 43 percent of homebuyers begin their search by looking at online listings, around twice as many as the share who start by contacting a real estate agent, according to NAR research.\nChavarria said he sees brokerage-exclusive listings as a bigger problem than the MLS-wide private network, but that both limit transparency for consumers.\n\u201cTo me, the only way it\u2019s truly available is if it\u2019s available to the consumer, and it\u2019s not this fee for service that you have to have a real estate license to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it really goes back to my firm belief that people start their housing search these days long before they start their Realtor search.\u201d\nMRED vows to protect fair housing\nIn its statement, MRED said it is committed to fair housing and that the Private Listing Network was created to address the transparency concerns presented by off-market offerings.\n\u201cMRED takes fair housing very seriously, with rules and processes in place to scan all private and active listings for violations,\u201d the MLS\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe also believe that any bad actors deserve all consequences, professionally and legally, that come to them.\u201d\nMRED also questioned the methodology Zillow used in its analysis, which surveyed listings available on a single day in October. It noted that majority white neighborhoods have three times as many listings as non-white neighborhoods and institutional investors and companies that make fast cash offers on homes tend to target purchases in non-white neighborhoods. MRED argued that since every broker has access to the Private Listing Network, it promotes a fair market.\nZillow claimed its analysis controlled for price, home type, location and broker activity.\n\u201cMRED was built to safeguard open access, prevent discrimination, and ensure that every brokerage, large and small, can compete on equal footing,\u201d the MLS said. \u201cOur PLN was created to prevent exclusionary shadow markets, not enable them.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Draper &amp; Kramer is beefing up its suburban Chicago footprint with the acquisition of Eleven33, a 263-unit luxury apartment building in Oak Park.\nThe 12-story complex, which garnered more than $88 million in the transaction, was completed in 2019 and sits steps from both the CTA Green Line and Metra\u2019s UP-West Line at 1133 South Boulevard.\nThe deal gives the buyer, a century-old local firm, another stabilized, transit-rich asset as Class A rental demand keeps outpacing supply in inner-ring suburbs, according to a news release from Draper &amp; Kramer.\nNewmark represented the sellers in the transaction, Willow Bridge Property and AEW; Draper &amp; Kramer didn\u2019t use a broker.\nThe sale looks to be a win for Willow Bridge and AEW. Willow constructed the property on two former Oak Park village parking lots and later secured a $53 million loan to refinance the building from a MetLife Real Estate Lending venture in late 2023, according to Cook County property records.\nDraper said in the release that it will also take over management of the property, which is 95 percent leased and has averaged roughly 94 percent occupancy this year. The deal marks a hometown play for Draper &amp; Kramer, whose holdings stretch across major Sun Belt metros but remain anchored in Chicago. Blas Puzon, chief investment officer for the firm, said that the Oak Park apartment complex purchase amounted to a \u201cspecial opportunity to invest in our own backyard.\u201d\nEleven33 sits within walking distance of Oak Park\u2019s Lake Street retail corridor, the Pleasant District and parks, the public library and the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District \u2014 a package that has turned the village into one of metro Chicago\u2019s most durable renter magnets. Current rents start at $1,945 for studios and scale up to three-bedrooms spanning as large as 1,500 square feet.\nUnits come with 9- and 10-foot ceilings, oversized windows, plank flooring, in-unit laundry and contemporary kitchens with quartz countertops and two-tone cabinetry. Some apartments add balconies or terraces. Amenities are in line with the product level: a 24-hour fitness center with yoga studios, clubroom and entertainment lounge, conference rooms, indoor bike storage, a fifth-floor sun deck with fire pits and grills, and a pet suite that includes an indoor dog run. There\u2019s also a 252-space controlled-access garage for residents and 148 public spaces.\nManagement of the building folds neatly into an existing Chicago-area platform for Draper &amp; Kramer that now spans more than 5,500 multifamily units across six states. Puzon said the firm is keeping most of Eleven33\u2019s on-site staff.\n",

        "content": "Elk Grove Village is emptying its net in an aggressive push to assist multifamily developer Nick Papanicholas Jr.\u2019s goal of building a new indoor ice arena on the Chicago suburb\u2019s west side.\nThe local government is playing a hands-on role, cutting a $27 million, zero-interest loan to the developer, whose firms include local builder\nWingspan Development Group\nand Nicholas &amp; Associates.\nThe financing \u2014 backed by general fund reserves \u2014 will support a 72,560-square-foot twin-sheet ice rink complex rising at the northwest corner of Meacham and Biesterfield roads, a site local leaders say has sat stubbornly vacant for decades, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The\nvillage\napproved a 20-year redevelopment agreement and repayment term with Papanicholas, whose firms recently delivered a similar project in Rosemont and operate rinks in\nMount Prospect\nand Vernon Hills.\nAs part of the deal, Papanicholas is personally guaranteeing repayment. The\nvillage\nalso sold him the underlying 9.7-acre parcel for $4.5 million, the same price it paid to buy the property last year, and threw in two retail spaces for $1 each. The developer plans to lease the retail pads to food-service tenants.\nMayor Craig Johnson framed the financing as a catalyst play, pointing to the promise of future sales tax revenue from the project and the long-vacant state of the corner. Johnson said the village \u201chad to take a bold step,\u201d adding that it\u2019s partnering with a proven rink operator rather than an untested developer.\nDemolition wrapped this fall on the shuttered Aldi and Staples stores that previously occupied the block. Construction is now underway on the arena\u2019s structure, which will include an 8,800-square-foot second-floor restaurant, a grab-and-go shop, study spaces and a physical therapy clinic.\nThe price tag for the arena itself is pegged at $28 million excluding land, according to the project budget. Under the loan terms, Papanicholas will submit monthly reimbursement certificates to access funds.\nThe repayment schedule calls for $800,000 annually over the first five years, rising to $1 million a year in years 6 through 10, $1.1 million in years 11 through 15 and $1.2 million in years 16 through 20, before a final $6.5 million balloon payment. The facility is slated to open in August 2026 and will host youth hockey organizations including Chicago Mission and the Northwest Chargers.\nPapanicholas is already busy elsewhere in town: his firms are also behind The Vue, a 287-unit development under construction on Elk Grove Village\u2019s east side.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The company plans to have the space fully built out by mid-February.\nThe booming artificial intelligence sector has helped inject new life into the recovering San Francisco office market. AI giants like\nAnthropic\nand\nNvidia\nhave been grabbing additional space, as have other firms like\nSierra\nand\nPostman\n. Overall, approximately 30 percent of office demand last quarter\nwas from AI companies\n.\n\u201cAI is hot right now,\u201d Peri Demestihas, head of North America real estate for Industrious, told the Business Times. \u201cBut not all of this is AI-related.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just in San Francisco that Industrious is growing.\nLast month, it leased\nnearly 19,800 square feet\nat 220 Park in Burlingame on the San Francisco Peninsula in an effort to reach workers closer to home. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of coworking in San Francisco and a fair amount in Palo Alto, but nothing in Burlingame,\u201d Demestihas\ntold\nthe Business Times last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket filled with folks who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go into San Francisco or Palo Alto. I want to live and work here.\u2019\u201d\nUnlike the\nformerly bankrupt WeWork\n, Industrious has homed in on selective expansions and high-quality locations rather than unfettered growth. CBRE invested in Industrious in 2020 and bought the remaining stake this year in a deal placing the coworking company at about $800 million. CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic believes Industrious can attract workers as companies adapt versatile\nreturn-to-office\nstrategies.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re beyond a return to the office,\u201d Sulentic told investors earlier this month. \u201cThe leasing markets are back.\u201d\nOther Industrious locations in the Bay Area include outposts in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Concord and Walnut Creek.\nOn the AI front, San Francisco hosts 6.8 million square feet of AI-focused offices, per CBRE data noted by the Business Times; AI companies have leased another 6 million square feet in Silicon Valley. Still, the office vacancy rate in San Francisco remains at 31 percent, according to Colliers data cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Both are five-bedroom, five-bathroom homes asking about $1,000 per square foot; 1704 Newton Street, the top deal, was asking $4 million when it went under contract, and 701 West Elizabeth Street was asking $3.9 million.\nBoth homes listed at higher prices in March, with the former asking $4.1 million and the latter $5 million.\nThe sellers of both homes also bought them relatively recently. Alexander Lo bought 1704 Newton in 2024, and entrepreneurs Elizabeth and Greg Mercer bought 701 West Elizabeth in 2022.\nSellers who bought their homes during the post-pandemic boom contribute significantly to the\ntrend of price cuts among Austin\u2019s top deals\n, according to Redfin agent Abby Alwan, who represented 701 West Elizabeth. Quick flips could yield profits in 2021 and 2022, but that\u2019s not the case this year.\n\u201cThis is a situation of buying in the\nheight of the market\nand then having to sell during a rough time,\u201d Alwan said.\n\u201cWe had pretty good feedback on pricing in the private network. And then, you know, buyers took their time. There\u2019s a lot of inventory in 78704 right now, and all over, buyers are a little more picky about all the little things and exactly where they want to be because they have homes to choose from.\u201d\nThe final sale price isn\u2019t disclosed, and the deed hasn\u2019t been recorded yet, but the buyer is local, Alwan said.\nThe Mercers are both entrepreneurs. They co-founded JungleScout, a tech company that makes search tools for Amazon sellers, and Elizabeth is the founder of Sleekform, an ergonomic office furniture seller.\nKuper Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate Agent\nKumara Wilcoxon\nrepresented the seller of 1704 Newton.\n",

        "content": "Arlington is doubling down on\nSam Mahrouq\u2019s bid\nto reimagine one of the city\u2019s most tired commercial corridors.\nCity council signed off on a $3.8 million Chapter 380 grant Nov. 18 to help his firm Mahrouq Enterprises International assemble the last parcels needed for a sweeping mixed-use redevelopment along East Division Street, a key connector between downtown, UT Arlington and the city\u2019s stadium-packed\nEntertainment District\n, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe grant is for two land purchases: 806 East Division Street, a 0.3-acre plot that\u2019s currently home to a tire shop, and 632 East Front Street, a 0.6-acre vacant tract. The incentives are meant to unlock what staff describe as a \u201ccatalytic\u201d project that could feature a food hall, multifamily, retail, restaurants and structured parking.\nMahrouq has started construction on\nCaravan Court\n, a 145-key upscale hotel at 205 North Collins Street, after receiving $8 million in incentives last year.\nMahrouq has emerged as the city\u2019s most influential player on Division Street. He previously received a $7 million grant for keeping his company Ikon Technologies in Arlington while helping the city chart a\nredevelopment strategy\nfor the corridor. Mahrouq has said he intends for Caravan Court to be the spark that helps shift Division Street\u2019s identity away from its long-standing cluster of auto dealerships \u2014 many of which he owns \u2014 and toward something closer to Dallas\u2019 transformed former industrial strips.\nCity officials appear to agree. Economic development director Gus Garcia called Division Street a crucial link tying together the city\u2019s marquee districts and said the partnership with Mahrouq is part of a coordinated push to revive a corridor\nArlington\nhas been trying to reinvent for more than two decades.\nThe new agreement lays out a staged timeline: a conceptual brief within 18 months, construction drawings within 36, financing secured by month 54 and vertical construction underway within 60. Arlington will also enter a long-term parking lease on the property, which Mahrouq\u2019s group can later buy out if the full project proceeds.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rainey Street\u2019s skyline sprint is nearly finished, but one stubborn holdout remains: a 1990s IHOP squatting in the shadow of Waterline, the 74-story tower soon to be the tallest in Texas.\nThe diner at 707 East Cesar Chavez Street is headed to a Dec. 2 foreclosure sale, meaning one of the last underbuilt corners in downtown Austin\u2019s hottest district may finally be in play. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthe auction notice, adding another chapter to the unraveling of Nate Paul\u2019s\nWorld Class Holdings\n.\nThe 0.8-acre parcel \u2014 appraised at $26.8 million \u2014 is among the once-sprawling portfolio Paul has shed since a 2019 FBI raid. The site has been posted for foreclosure three months running, with previous sales rescheduled, leaving questions about whether the December date will hold.\nIf it does, buyers will be circling one of the few remaining development opportunities in a district that has transformed from bungalow row to a hyper-dense cluster of hotels, luxury apartments and condo towers. Roughly 7,500 residents will eventually live in the\nRainey Street Historic District\n, with that number swelling to around 10,000 when visitors are factored in.\nNext door, Waterline is still rising; a few blocks away, the convention center overhaul is gaining steam. But anyone dreaming of a ground-up project will first have to contend with the IHOP lease.\nNeither the manager nor the chain\u2019s corporate office would comment to the outlet on its status. Developers say an expiring lease would unlock near-term redevelopment, while a longer one would require a buyout or a wait-and-see approach with rent checks rolling in. That uncertainty complicates an otherwise logical land play.\nEven so, the site\u2019s potential is obvious. Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns, behind several Rainey towers, said the parcel is large enough to support a major high-rise. He sees a hotel or apartments as the likeliest uses, noting the freeway adjacency makes\ncondos\nless attractive. Intracorp Texas president Brad Stein also pointed to hospitality and retail as best fits, though his firm isn\u2019t a bidder.\nAustin\u2019s zoning only sweetens the pot. With participation in the Downtown Density Bonus Program height limits would be freed up, allowing the site to reach a 15:1 floor-to-area ratio, and it would be free of Capitol View Corridor constraints. Austin City Council\u2019s new temporary\n350-foot height cap\ncan be exceeded through the bonus program.\nIf the auction finally proceeds, the last conspicuous gap on Rainey Street\u2019s skyline may not stay low for long.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After cashing out of Rockstar Energy in a multibillion-dollar sale to PepsiCo five years ago, founder Russell Weiner turned his attention from energy drinks to luxury Florida real estate.\nWeiner, who says he recently changed his name to Russell Savage, an homage to his father\u2019s radio name, started with a pair of\nmodest flips\n. In September 2020, he paid $32.9 million for two North Palm Beach homes \u2014 one on the ocean and the other across the street. The seller was Swedish model Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods.\nA month later, in October 2020, Savage sold the two houses for $48.2 million to billionaire\nRobert F. Smith\n. That marked a 47 percent gain in about 35 days.\nSavage was fresh off the sale of his company, a deal that was valued at more than $4 billion, according to Forbes. The publication also pegs Savage\u2019s current net worth at about $5.4 billion.\nHe continued to bet on luxury real estate in the Sunshine State. Most recently, he signed contracts to purchase\ntwo mansions\nin Stone Creek Ranch, a high-end, gated neighborhood in Palm Beach County where his neighbors will include actor Mark Wahlberg. He\u2019s paying more than $40 million for the two houses. Another flip could be on his radar, though he said last week in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he hasn\u2019t decided what he will do with the properties.\nWhile he said he\u2019s received offers to flip both homes for millions more, \u201cthere is far more upside to go,\u201d he added. He called Florida the new Golden State, and cited its lack of state income tax, pro-business policies and perception of low crime.\n\u201cEverything keeps going up in Florida,\u201d he said.\nHere\u2019s a look at his growing portfolio:\n9303 Hawk Shadow Lane in Stone Creek Ranch\nHe\u2019s under\ncontract to purchase\nthe 11,500-square-foot estate on 2.5 acres at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane. It\u2019s on the market for nearly $22 million with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Senada Ad\u017eem.\n16071 Quiet Vista Circle in Stone Creek Ranch\nHe\u2019s also\nin contract to buy\nthe 11,500-square-foot mansion at 16071 Quiet Vista Circle. The 2.6-acre property is on the market with Talbot Sutter of Sutter &amp; Nugent, asking $20.9 million.\n43 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach\nIn August, Savage paid $35.3 million for the 1.1-acre property at 43 Star Island Drive on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island. The 11,104-square-foot, eight-bedroom mansion previously belonged to former talk show host and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell. The property has 200 feet of water frontage, two guest houses, a boat house and tropical landscaping, according to the listing. Savage plans to renovate and expand the estate into a 15,000-square-foot mansion with a master suite, gym, spa, padel court and cabana. It will likely hit the market for more than $100 million.\n5300 North Bay Road in Miami Beach\nSavage owns the waterfront 5,552-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 5300 North Bay Road. Developer and hospitality mogul Keith Menin\npaid $16.1 million\nfor the 0.3-acre property in 2024, but Savage said he is the true owner. He hired Menin to renovate the home into a seven-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom house that spans 6,023 square feet. It\u2019s on the market with Marko Gojanovic and Reid Heidenry of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty for $32.5 million.\n5011, 5101 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach\nSavage has spent years assembling land for a compound on Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach. In 2021, Leila and David Centner sold the properties at 5011 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive, which totaled nearly 3.5 acres, to Savage\nfor more than $35 million\n. Earlier this year, Savage foreclosed on the middle property at 5101 Pine Tree Drive.\nConstruction of his massive, $100 million estate on the assemblage began in 2023, but was held up by messy litigation involving Savage and his former project manager, Andrea D\u2019Alessio, and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s companies.\n",

        "content": "Across the feast of Edwardian-era buildings that help define San Francisco\u2019s architectural style, few command reverence like the patina green Sentinel Building in North Beach.\nEven Francis Ford Coppola, one of cinema\u2019s great appreciators of beauty, couldn\u2019t help himself. The director bought the seven-story structure, modeled after Manhattan\u2019s Flat Iron Building, for $500,000 in 1973, one year after he secured artistic renown with the release The Godfather.\nNow, one year after the release of arguably his most epic theatrical flop, Megalopolis, Coppola is using the building as collateral on a private loan.\nAccording to documents filed with the San Francisco assessor-recorder earlier this month, Francis Ford Coppola Presents, one of the director\u2019s companies, has taken out a loan with Capital Holdings VI LLC, and has offered the Sentinel Building as a guarantee. The Sentinel Building, owned by another of Coppola\u2019s companies, Sofia Properties LP, hosts the historic Caf\u00e9 Zoetrope on the ground floor, and the offices for Coppola\u2019s production company, American Zoetrope above.\nThe loan amount is undisclosed, as is the assessed value of the building. In any case, a default would make\u00a0 Capital Holdings VI LLC the landlord of the property, which the\ncity designated as historic in 1970\n. Neither Gordon Wang, an executive at multiple Coppola companies who signed the documents, nor Natalie Talbott, listed as the agent for Capital Holdings VI in state records, returned The Real Deal\u2019s calls for comment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Coppola has used the building to guarantee a loan. In the 1980s, Coppola nearly lost the building in a debtor\u2019s auction, but allegedly paid off a $1.7 million loan from Security Pacific Bank just in time to keep the property. In 1998, Coppola used the address again to secure a $1.5 million loan from First Republic Bank.\nCoppola\u2019s financial straits in recent years have been well reported. To fund Megalopolis \u2014 released in 2024 but conceived decades earlier \u2014 the director merged his Sonoma County wineries with a Napa-based brand. He then borrowed $200 million against his ownership stake to finance the project. Despite costing $120 million, Megalopolis grossed just $14.4 million at the box office.\nCoppola used the rest of that $200 million loan to fund improvements at both his high-end Inglenook Winery in the Napa Valley and the Sentinel Building.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal\n, part of those improvements to the San Francisco flat-iron tower included converting the offices formerly occupied by his production company into hotel rooms.\nThe director recently said he was broke, telling music producer Rick Rubin in a podcast that \u201cI don\u2019t have any money because I invested all the money that I borrowed to make \u2018Megalopolis.\u201d Coppola recently made headlines when he announced that, in December, he planned to auction off seven of his watches \u2014 one of which is expected to fetch north of $1 million.\n\u201cI need to get some money to keep the ship afloat,\u201d he told the New York Times last month.\nEarlier this month, he closed on the sale of his Belize island for $1.8 million,\na move the Hollywood Reporter tied to his financial losses\nfrom Megalopolis.\nCoppola is no stranger to financial stress driven by creative risks \u2014 his 1979 Vietnam War epic, Apocalypse Now, famously drove him into debt. He has reportedly spent much of the last year in Europe, working on his next project, a musical adaptation of Edith Wharton\u2019s novel, \u201cGlimpses of the Moon.\u201d",

        "content": "The saga of the Elizabeth Street Garden is taking a holiday break.\nThe would-be developers of the affordable housing project at the Nolita site paused\ntheir lawsuit\nagainst the city over the weekend, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The freeze appears to stem from negotiations with the city over an alternate site for the project, though those discussions seemed to be taking place when the lawsuit was filed.\nThe talks revolve around 22 Suffolk Street, a smaller lot a half-mile away from the garden. Council member Christopher Marte endorsed a 200-unit, all-affordable development for that site.\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached an agreement with the development team that brought this lawsuit that puts the litigation on pause until after the new year and withdraws the application for a temporary restraining order regarding the garden\u2019s status,\u201d First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said in a statement.\nDespite the pause in litigation, the developers are still against transferring the Elizabeth Street Garden lot to the Parks Department.\nPennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester filed a lawsuit a week ago alleging that Mayor Eric Adams illegally designated the site as a city park. The developers had been chosen almost a decade ago to build 123 senior housing units on the city-owned site, a project dubbed Haven Green.\nThe complaint accused Adams of deciding the site\u2019s future use without going through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park.\nThe administration claims Ulurp is only needed when it is transferring city property to private interests, not when it is moving a site from one city agency\u2019s purview to another.\nLast year, it seemed like Haven Green would\nfinally break ground\nafter years of protests and delays. The Adams administration, however,\nreversed\nits position on the project, announcing it would not kick out the sculpture garden from the site. Instead, the administration made a deal with Marte, who agreed to support the rezoning of three other sites that would net 620 affordable units, more than 400 apartments than were planned for the garden site.\nThe reversal\ndrew criticism\nfrom City Council leaders, housing advocates, developers and other elected officials.\nThe city will decide on the request for a preliminary injunction early next year, when a new mayor will be in charge.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "UHealth, the health care division of the University of Miami, continues expanding its portfolio of South Florida medical office facilities after acquiring a Deerfield Beach building for $16.4 million.\nCoral Gables-based UHealth bought a 45,136-square-foot building at 1192 East Newport Center Drive, records show. The two-story facility is leased to the health system\u2019s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The\nUniversity of Miami\nis led by President Joe Echevarria.\nThe deal breaks down to $363 per square foot. UHealth paid roughly $7 million above the previous sale price 14 years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Toledo, Ohio-based Welltower, paid $9.5 million for the 3.1-acre site in 2011, records show. The sale to UHealth is part of Welltower\u2019s sell-off of a\n$6 billion\nmedical office portfolio.\nCompleted in 2001 within the Newport Center business park, the building houses a radiation oncology center and chemotherapy infusion unit.\nUhealth also owns an adjacent medical office building at 1300 East Newport Center Drive in Deerfield Beach, which it purchased for $8.2 million in 2018, records show.\nThe latest Deerfield Beach acquisition is part of UHealth\u2019s growth strategy beyond its main campus in Allapattah\u2019s Miami Health District, according to the health system\u2019s website. In January, UHealth leased 11,200 square feet at Northwest 87th Avenue and Northwest 53rd Terrace in\nDowntown Doral\nfor a new medical outpost, offering services from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and physical therapy programs.\nThe health system also leases the six-story, 160,000-square-foot UHealth Doral Medical Center that is also within Downtown Doral, a massive mixed-use community master developed by Coral Gables-based Codina Partners.\nIn December, UHealth assembled three commercial properties near its Allapattah medical school campus for a combined\n$68 million\n, including a medical office\u2013anchored strip mall and a parking lot just north of Jackson Memorial Hospital. Last summer, UM paid\n$40 million\nfor the former Macy\u2019s furniture store at 13251 South Dixie Highway in Pinecrest, hinting at another potential health care expansion.",

        "content": "Real estate has often sat opposite\nRae Chen Huang\non key housing issues. Now, as a Los Angeles mayoral hopeful, can the movement organizer and ordained Presbyterian minister bridge the gap with the industry?\nSince the dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America and Sawtelle resident announced the launch of her campaign earlier this month at an Arts District brewery, the public has been served broad strokes on a platform. The pledges might sound like familiar fodder from left-of-center, but they take on recent resonance on the heels of winning campaigns by one-time longshots in New York City and Seattle: Affordable housing, free transit, transition to renewable energy and addressing public safety through a boost in mental health services.\n\u201cWe need a new kind of leadership, free from the tired establishment and the billionaire class,\u201d Huang said in her launch video. \u201cMayor Bass failed to deliver the housing you need and wasted taxpayer dollars with little to show for it.\u201d\nThe launch video zeroed in on a particular sore point of commercial real estate, showing the bankruptcy, abandoned and graffiti-scarred towers of the Oceanwide Plaza across the the Los Angeles Convention Center as a knock on Bass\u2019s effectiveness.\nHuang currently works as deputy director of Housing Now! California, a Los Angeles organization that calls itself a \u201cmovement\u201d pushing for affordable housing. The group is aligned with over 150 other organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, multiple local DSA chapters, the Los Angeles Tenants Union, Eviction Defense Network and other groups.\nIt\u2019s early for Huang\u2019s campaign and money raised has not yet been reported to the city\u2019s Ethics Committee, according to a check of records Tuesday.\nWhile the immediate reaction to Huang\u2019s bid for mayor was to liken her to New York\u2019s\nZohran Mamdani\n\u2014 and there are similarities \u2014 others have put a finer point on it. Indeed, some political spectators see Huang as a longshot who nevertheless holds the potential to play a key role in forcing a runoff by keeping Bass from a clear majority in the June primary. Candidates need more than 50 percent of the votes to clinch a victory in the first round, and Huang along with former Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent and City Hall veteran Austin Beutner and 11 others could lay the field wide open.\nFormer Los Angeles County Board of Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky pointed out to the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nthat LA is more diverse when it comes to its voter base than New York or Seattle, both of which voted in so-called \u201clongshot\u201d candidates with Mamdani and\nKatie Wilson\n, respectively. Those diverse views could prove to be an uphill battle for Huang if she has to hunt up votes in the San Fernando Valley, which has traditionally been more conservative than the rest of the city.\nThe mayoral hopeful did not respond to an interview request from\nThe Real Deal\nMonday, and she has yet to stake a clear position on\nMeasure United to House LA\n, the city\u2019s so-called mansion tax.\nLegislative maneuvering\nHuang did tell the\nLos Angeles Times\nshe supports the 120-unit affordable housing project on Venice Boulevard, known as Venice Dell.\nA look back at legislation Housing Now! has supported offers a closer view of her broader outlook, with one clue apparent in the backing Housing Now! gave SB 567, which was authored by longtime labor leader Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) and boosted tenant protections in 2023.\nThe California Apartment Association, California Association of Realtors, Apartment Association of Orange County, Building Owners and Managers Association of California and Institute of Real Estate Management were among the industry groups opposed to the bill.\nThe law creates more restrictions in no-fault evictions, where a landlord seeks to end a lease for reasons unrelated to the tenant, such as major remodeling or a decision to take the unit off market.\nHuang\u2019s group also backed SB 555, authored by Aisha Wahab (D-Hayward) and signed into law in 2023.\nThe California Association of Realtors was among SB 555\u2019s opposition.\nThe bill requires the state\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development to complete a social housing study. This would map out how to increase social housing for low- to moderate-income residents.\n\u201cSocial Housing\u201d\nHuang spoke on the concept of \u201csocial housing\u201d \u2014 which can range from publicly-owned developments to tenants taking ownership cooperatively \u2014 during a May\npanel\nhosted by affordable housing publication Shelterforce and Nonprofit Quarterly. She said she sees a need for publicly- or community-owned housing when it comes to answers around funding, development and acquisition.\n\u201cOne of the challenges, and one of the dangers, with [private involvement] is that if we do lean into private funding for social housing, it does then return back into the same old situation that we have, in which case then it becomes another place of profit,\u201d Huang said during the panel.\nThe state\u2019s Housing and Community Development agency, meanwhile, tapped UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center for Housing Innovation to handle the SB 555 report, with the study expected to be completed by 2027.\nIt\u2019s been estimated the study could pave the way for anywhere between 1.2 million and 1.4 million affordable homes. It could also hold implications for cities\u2019 housing elements \u2014 the roadmap municipalities are required to create for their long-term housing plans. Those plans must be certified by the state. Notably, an unapproved housing plan paves the way for developers\u2019 use of builder\u2019s remedy, which has been tapped for projects in\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nand\nBeverly Hills\n.\nState of play\nHuang enters a candidate pool that\u2019s so far stirred little buzz outside of political circles.\nFirst off, there\u2019s incumbent Mayor Karen Bass, who has raised $1.6 million, according to city records through June 30. However, Bass has been dogged by the handling of the\nPalisades Fire\nleading some calls for her\nresignation\n, and a nearly $1 billion budget deficit earlier this year that has since been closed.\nA total of 13 challengers to Bass have emerged so far. The biggest name currently is Beutner, a Democrat. There\u2019s also Asaad Alnajjar, a civil engineer and chair of Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council\u2019s Safety and Transit Committee. Alnajjar has raised nearly $39,000 from the CEO of Los Angeles-based Caltron Construction and the head of Hillsborough venture capital firm Andra Capital among others, according to city records.\nAnother potential candidate is\nRick Caruso\n, with the developer yet to say whether he might make another run for mayor, pursue the governor\u2019s office or sit out electoral politics in 2026.\n",

        "content": "A long-contested slice of Schaumburg near the Rolling Meadows border is back in play, this time with fewer units and a potential tax boost to make the numbers work.\nThe village is set to kick off a public process next month that could extend a nearby tax increment financing district to cover the 33-acre Loeber Farm property, even as a revised residential plan heads to its first hearing. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat on Dec. 9 the village board will begin weighing whether to stretch its existing TIF district north of Algonquin Road.\nThe next day, the zoning board of appeals will take up Nitti Group LLC\u2019s new proposal for 122 for-sale homes \u2014 a mix of single-family houses, row homes and townhouses. It\u2019s a significant downshift from the\n357-unit rental-heavy plan\nthat sparked pushback from Rolling Meadows residents and officials last year. That version never reached a trustee vote.\nThe property, situated off Meacham Road near Algonquin Road, has a long history within the Loeber family, which is known for its luxury car dealerships. Purchased as a rural retreat, the site was used to raise racehorses and foster a countryside upbringing for the Loeber children.\nAttempts to develop the land have been ongoing since 2002 but have repeatedly stalled, most recently in 2016 when a proposal for 92 homes was rejected. The revised plan from\nNitti\nwas proposed last year.\nThe Nitti plan carries an estimated $82 million price tag. Schaumburg is considering directing $4.8 million in\nTIF-eligible spending\ntoward needed infrastructure, a fraction of the roughly $17 million the site is expected to generate before the district expires. The TIF is already 12 years old and could run only another decade, but officials say that\u2019s enough time to produce the required revenue.\nThe Loeber land has drawn a parade of redevelopment concepts over the years, but none sought TIF help until now. The district already covers the Verdian redevelopment and the emerging entertainment pocket along Meacham Road.\nVillage officials said infrastructure challenges on the site have kept density high in past proposals. Elevation swings require a sanitary lift station. The creek needs a bridge stout enough to support fire trucks, a fix the mayor pegs at $1 million. Water and sewer extensions aren\u2019t cheap either.\nSchaumburg\u2019s economic development\ndirector has called these \u201cextraordinary\u201d costs \u2014 the kind TIF dollars are designed to offset.\nMayor Tom Dailly said the village wants the TIF and development tracks to move in tandem. He also argued the incentive could be the lever that finally brings the project\u2019s scale in line with neighborhood expectations, adding the new plans provide an opportunity to reduce density.\nA joint review board representing local taxing bodies will need to be reconvened as part of the extension process. With required notices baked in, the village board could vote on the TIF expansion as soon as March.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A group of building owners claims New York\u2019s housing regulator is unlawfully coming after them for deregulating their rent-stabilized properties.\n\u201cBalanced Housing Solutions,\u201d the group listed as plaintiffs and led by political consultant Hank Sheinkopf, is suing the Division of Homes and Community Renewal, alleging that the agency is wrongfully applying rule changes around \u201csubstantial rehabilitations\u201d that went into effect in 2023. Former mayoral candidate Jim Walden is the group\u2019s attorney on the case.\nSubstantial rehabs are one of the only remaining avenues for owners looking to deregulate stabilized apartments after the state passed sweeping rent reform legislation in 2019.\nThe state defines a substantial rehab as the replacement of at least 75 percent of a building\u2019s systems in a property that is \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated.\u201d It matters how the building got that way: An owner can\u2019t deregulate their building if they drove tenants out through harassment or, on the extreme end, arson.\nOne way owners used to be able to prove a building was \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated\u201d and in need of renovation was if it was at least 80 percent vacant. The thinking was that if a building was mostly vacant, it was in bad shape and needed an overhaul.\nHCR proposed eliminating that option in 2022, and then\nfinalized\ngetting rid of it in November 2023.\nIn June of that year, state lawmakers\napproved\nlegislation that would have required owners of buildings that had undergone substantial rehabilitation to submit applications to HCR within six months of the bill becoming law. In other words, the agency would need to retroactively approve deregulation for every building that had been gut-renovated and deregulated. In some cases, this would have happened decades ago. The\nmeasure\nalso reiterated the emphasis on the need to prove that a building was in \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated condition,\u201d with no mention of a vacancy threshold.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\napproved\nthe\nmeasure\n, but with key changes, such as striking the retroactive nature of the bill: The new application rule would apply to substantial renovations initiated on or after January 1, 2024. Owners, from that point on, would need to submit applications to the state within one year of completing a substantial rehab in order to legally deregulate the building.\nThe group of owners suing the state argues that, despite completing work before November 2023, when HCR issued its new rules, the agency is trying to enforce the new regime, demanding proof that a building was \u201cuninhabitable\u201d rather than just at least 80 percent vacant.\nThe move violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s takings clause, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe bottom line here is that BHS\u2019s members invested tens of millions of dollars in rehabilitating housing for New Yorkers, and HCR is attempting to seize and/or redistribute the fruits of that investment through a fundamentally unfair, retroactive application of new rules to already completed projects, despite the fact that the Governor and then the Legislature expressly rejected any retroactive application of the Amendments,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeks an injunction barring the HCR from retroactively applying the November 2023 rules to substantial rehabs that were initiated before the new guidelines.\nAn HCR spokesperson said the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\nJim Walden, attorney for Balance Housing Solutions and previously an independent candidate for mayor, would not disclose specific properties or owners who are part of the group that filed the lawsuit. During a video press conference on Wednesday, he said the specific owners would not be disclosed at this point due to fear of retaliation from regulators. Presumably, if the lawsuit continues, the claims of specific owners will need to be presented to the court.\nThe owners renovated 31 buildings, all of which were at least 80 percent vacant at the time, according to the lawsuit. HCR is calling for the properties to be re-regulated and for the owners to reimburse tenants for rent overcharges resulting from the buildings\u2019 deregulation, the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that HCR has erroneously determined that any vacancies achieved through buyouts can\u2019t count toward the 80 percent threshold. Walden indicated that HCR applied this interpretation of the 80 percent rule sometime in 2023, though it isn\u2019t clear if this happened exclusively before the November 2023 rule change.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nhighlighted\nHCR\u2019s rejections of a rehab application at 117 North Fourth Street in Williamsburg. An entity called Creas Inc. bought the building for $9.75 million in 2023 from an LLC linked to Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties.\nThe building was deregulated after a substantial rehab in 2022.\nHCR said one of the reasons the renovation didn\u2019t meet its criteria was because three tenants who vacated the building had accepted buyouts ranging from $150,000 to $175,000. The agency maintained that the pricing of the buyouts suggested the properties weren\u2019t in poor shape.\nWalden, who dropped out of the mayoral race ahead of the general election and endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has been critical of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. He indicated on Wednesday that the lawsuit would likely be the first of many battles related to bringing \u201cmore common sense to the city\u201d when it comes to maintaining and growing the city\u2019s housing stock.\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago\u2019s most neglected subsidized housing complexes is poised for new ownership, ending a turbulent run under a pair of out-of-state investors who branded their company after a Ferris Bueller joke.\nIndian Trails Apartments \u2014 a 180-unit Section 8 development at 221 East 121st Place in West Pullman \u2014 is under contract to be sold as tenants recount years of unsafe conditions, revolving management and broken promises of repairs, WBEZ\nreported\nin partnership with the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe property\u2019s current owner, the Sausage King of Chicago, is primarily controlled by California investors\nAlan Smolinisky and Brian Chien-Chih Chen\n, best known for a portfolio of HUD-subsidized buildings held through companies named after 1980s movies. Public records show entities linked to their businesses collected more than $37 million in federal rent subsidies last year across 24 properties in 13 states. Indian Trails alone brought in over $2 million in HUD payments.\nResidents say the revenue hasn\u2019t shown up in their buildings. Since the complex was acquired in 2017 for $16.6 million \u2014 from longtime owner Kenneth Ringbloom, whose era is remembered for on-site maintenance and responsive management \u2014 conditions have deteriorated rapidly.\nThe Sausage King is now preparing to cut and run. Minority owner Robert Budman confirmed to WBEZ that the complex is being sold to another\nCalifornia developer\n, the Transcend Group, with closing expected by year-end. A prior financing application shows Transcend attempted to buy the property in 2023 for $27 million \u2014 a markup of more than $10 million over the 2017 sale price.\nChicago\u2019s City Council has already approved up to $31 million in loans for Transcend to rehabilitate apartments, upgrade common areas and enhance security. The firm has also requested additional HUD subsidies to support the rehab. But tenants worry about displacement and say trust has been eroded after years of neglect.\nThat comes after Indian Trails spent more than two years in building court for\nrepeated violations\n: failing heat and hot water, electrical issues, nonfunctioning fire safety equipment and plumbing failures. Tenants describe flooded basements, sewage leaks, rodent infestations and maintenance requests ignored for months.\nMultiple renovation plans announced by ownership never materialized, including two failed applications for state financing through the\nIllinois Housing Development Authority\n. The property cycled through managers before landing with a Conquest Housing affiliate, which residents and organizers say has been the least responsive yet.\nAdvocates warn the saga is emblematic of a broader business model in which investors extract HUD-backed rents while allowing buildings to decay.\nAs one organizer told the council, \u201cThe Sausage King is trying to cash out \u2026 If we don\u2019t talk about what happened, the Transcend Group becomes the next Sausage King.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Silicon Valley\u2019s commercial market saw a breakneck comeback in the third quarter, with leasing coming at a clip not seen since before the pandemic.\nLeasing activity for commercial property in Santa Clara County, San Mateo County and Fremont totaled 20.4 million square feet in the third quarter, the Mercury News\nreported\n, citing new findings from the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies and JLL. The pace of commercial leasing was up 48.9 percent from the 13.7 million square feet that was leased in the second quarter.\nArtificial intelligence, unsurprisingly, is a big factor.\n\u201cAI is driving a lot of what\u2019s happening in Silicon Valley and San Francisco,\u201d Phil Mahoney, an executive vice chairman with Newmark, said. \u201c\nNvidia\n, Google,\nMeta\n, Microsoft and\nApple\nare all doing well, and that is great for the overall environment. You have the major companies, and you have the rising up of AI-funded growth companies. These have certainly helped to absorb a lot of the better space.\u201d\nThat improvement is expected to continue into next year, with leasing activity predicted to increase even further.\nThe surge follows a string of headline deals, such as major downtown Sunnyvale leases by\nDatabricks\nand Crowdstrike, that helped absorb large blocks of space. Tenants who might have sat on their hands in recent years are now back on the hunt, some brokers say.\n\u201cTenants are out right now looking for real deals,\u201d Colliers executive vice president David Sandlin said.\n\u201cThe market is certainly more positive than it was two years ago,\u201d Newmark\u2019s Mahoney added. \u201cThere was a lot of momentum going into the election last year that was lost in the first quarter. But that momentum is now coming back.\u201d\nCommercial development, meanwhile, is also inching toward a comeback. About 5.6 million square feet of new space was delivered in the third quarter, up 5.5 percent from the 5.3 million square feet of completed development in the previous quarter. A newly built office building in San Jose\u2019s Santana Row has been among those new constructions drawing several leasing tenants.\nAt the same time, the market\u2019s scars are hard to miss. While office vacancies dipped slightly to 22.2 percent from a record high of 23 percent in the second quarter, they remain more than double pre-pandemic norms and above dot-com bust levels. Laboratory space, once viewed as a shining light in the commercial property sector after the pandemic, reached a 37 percent vacancy rate after a development boom far outpaced demand. Asking rents also slid 7 percent from last year, marking their lowest point in a decade.\nStill, the quarter saw positive net absorption, suggesting companies are taking slightly more space than they\u2019re giving back. Colliers\u2019 large-user pipeline, for example, has ballooned to 11 million square feet, up from 2 million during the pandemic.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

The buyer was a trio of firms: AM Management, Eyn Holding and Axonic Capital.\nThe deal for the 350,000-square-foot building \u2014 which closed on Tuesday night \u2014 breaks down to $380 per square foot. That\u2019s a 53 percent discount from the\n$282 million\n\u2014 and $800 per square foot \u2014 Clarion doled out to acquire the property from EQ Office in 2018.\nAt the time of the deal, which was financed with a $141 million loan from MetLife, the property was a darling of the TAMI tenant movement. Tenants included Roku, VTS and Guess. That financing is remaining in place under the incoming ownership.\nEastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips, Will Silverman and Jeff Organisciak advised the seller. All involved companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nThe century-old, 22-story building between Sixth Avenue and Broadway and West 40th and 41st Streets was renovated in 2015. Tenants include Quartet Health, AI platform Snowflake, Demandbase, MediaRadar and French bakery Maman, which occupies retail space at the building\u2019s base.\nDespite the conversion boom taking hold in Manhattan, there are no plans to turn the property into a residence.\nThis isn\u2019t the only tough situation Clarion is facing.\nThe developer and Alchemy Properties are in\ndanger of foreclosure\nat 209-211 East 43rd Street, a 24-story, 211,000-square-foot property only a block from Grand Central Terminal. A Miami-based plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court against a limited liability company with apparent links to a venture between the two owners, alleging default on a $57 million loan.\nElsewhere around Bryant Park, Salesforce recently\nadded 71,000 square feet\nto its footprint at La Caisse\u2019s 3 Bryant Park.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

A total of 18 districts across the state tied to major research universities are commanding higher rents, lower vacancies and outsized investor interest as tenant demand consolidates around talent, walkability and lab-ready space.\nThe Stanford Research Park,\nUCLA\nInnovation Park, UC San Diego\u2019s Science Research Park and San Diego State\u2019s Mission Valley Innovation District are among the 18 college markets that have proven most resilient and promising, delivering higher rents and occupancy rates than nearby office and retail markets.\nOffice properties in these districts average a 10 percent rent premium and vacancy rates 220 basis points below the national norm, the JLL report says. Older innovation districts post an even sharper edge, with office asking rents running 36 percent above U.S. averages. And when looking at the surrounding metro areas of each of these communities, offices in the innovation districts fetch a 26 percent premium and maintain vacancy nearly 300 basis points lower than nearby submarkets.\nRetail is riding the same wave. Mixed-use developments in particular, such as properties with student-friendly food and services on floors below labs and research and development spaces, help activate these neighborhoods and boost performance. Retail rents in innovation districts are 28 percent higher than in surrounding areas, powered by high foot traffic from students, researchers and\nadjacent residential growth\n.\nUniversity-anchored innovation districts first emerged in the mid-20th century and grew in the 1950s and 1960s.\nStanford\nResearch Park, for example, now the epicenter of the research and development market in Silicon Valley, was founded in 1951. While districts such as these have become real estate hotspots across various sectors, they often spend many years working to reach that status.\n\u201cFostering the growth of such economic development engines takes time,\u201d Emily Crutcher, senior vice president for JLL\u2019s government and education division, told Globe Street. \u201cUniversity-anchored innovation districts may take decades to cultivate and grow, which requires committed university leadership across multiple administrations; the support of local, state and federal agencies; partnerships with corporations; exposure to\n[venture capital]\nnetworks; programs with local community colleges and more.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of Houston\u2019s busiest retail hubs is bracing for another overhaul as MetroNational tees up the redevelopment of Memorial City Mall, adding to the sweeping changes already reshaping the west Houston corridor.\nEarly filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation indicate that the owner plans to level about 216,000 square feet of interior space, relocate a mall entrance and carve out a new ground-floor lobby with tenant areas. The Houston Chronicle\nreported\nthat another 190,000 square feet outside the mall would come down to make room for a reworked parking layout and other site updates.\nThe project is expected to cost $8.8 million. Gensler is listed as the architect.\nMetroNational\nconfirmed the demolition will include portions of the old Sears wing but didn\u2019t specify which segments are on the chopping block. Sears was the mall\u2019s original anchor when it opened in 1966 and\nMetroNational\nrazed the main store building in 2020 after the chain shuttered the location two years earlier. Construction documents label the latest project \u201c400 Gessner\u2013North Site Phase 2,\u201d hinting that the work could land near the Cinemark theater. Temporary tenants, including kiosks and pop-ups, will be moved before the walls come down.\nWork is scheduled to start in May 2026. The parking-related improvements are expected to wrap by January 2027, with the broader redevelopment finishing that April. The landlord said it will release final details as plans take shape.\nThe mall revamp is separate from MetroNational\u2019s splashier 27-acre \u201ctown square\u201d proposal unveiled in 2022, which the company said remains under evaluation. Still, the amount of capital flowing into the area shows how aggressively MetroNational is repositioning its portfolio around Memorial City.\nAcross I-10, the firm teamed up with Radom Capital on\nGreenside\n, a 35,000-square-foot mixed-use project set to bring retail, restaurants, offices and wellness concepts online in 2026. And earlier this year, MetroNational snapped up the 309,000-square-foot retail component of CityCentre, one of the city\u2019s most trafficked open-air shopping districts, soon after acquiring the former\nMarathon Oil\ntower next door.\nTaken together, the project point to another wave of reinvestment in a submarket where retail density keeps climbing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What do you do when your new home purchase turns out to be as good as dirt? What about if it turns out to be dirt itself?\nA San Francisco couple unknowingly bought an unpaved alleyway in the\nOuter Sunset\ndistrict after what they believed was a bargain purchase for a property at 1924-1926 Kirkham Street being auctioned off for as little as $1, Realtor.com\nreported\n.\nJ.J. Hollingsworth and Alemayehu Mergia, who lived next door, jumped on the opportunity to buy what they believed was a two-unit\nrental\nproperty that had sold for more than $1 million last December. The couple submitted a bid for $25,000 as well as an additional $8,000 for the transfer tax.\nWhen their transfer tax check was returned, they did more research and found that they had, in fact, not purchased the building at 1924-1926 Kirkham Street, but instead bought the 83-foot-long, 7-foot-wide unpaved alley between that property and their home. The property is officially listed as \u201cDirt Alley\u201d on\nGoogle Maps\n, though the couple has since taken to nicknaming it \u201cHollingsworth Alley.\u201d\nIt was a simple case of not reading the fine print. After closely re-reading a letter from the tax collector that initially notified them of the auction, they realized they missed several key pieces of information, including a note that the auction was for the sale of plots that had been \u201crendered unusable by their size, location or other conditions.\u201d\nBy the time they realized their mistake, the couple had already celebrated prematurely.\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d Hollingsworth\ntold\nCBS News. \u201cIt was absolutely devastating. We had already celebrated and told our friends. I went over and said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m your landlord now. We\u2019re not going to kick you out or raise your rent.'\u201d\nTo make matters worse, the couple paid much more than any other bidder had offered in the auction. About half of the 47 plots in the sealed auction were sold, four for just $1; the rest sold for between $10 and $11,000, with the median sale price (omitting the couple\u2019s bid) being $435, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nMergia and Hollingsworth are now working to get their money back, though that would involve the\nBoard of Supervisors\nvoting to overturn the sale \u2014 something it\u2019s only done once in the past.\nThe tax collector\u2019s office, meanwhile, insists it communicated the nature of the property as clearly as possible.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The U.S. Social Security Administration is also a tenant.\nThe buyer paid roughly $939 a square foot for the building, and $15.5 million above the previous sale price 11 years ago.\nAn entity managed by Coral Gables-based investor Dominic Cavagnuolo, bought the 1-acre site for $8 million in 2014, records show. The two-story building was completed in 1982. The seller previously filed plans with the city to redevelop the property into 5,000 square feet of retail and office space, but the project is now off the table, according to Vizzda.\nAs of June, JPMorgan held $578 million in deposits at the Chase Alton Road branch, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nThe banking giant also recently spent\n$53.7 million\nfor Shoppes at Heron Lakes, a 145,618-square-foot retail center in Coral Springs. The pair of single-story buildings sold for $369 per square foot. Tenants at Shoppes at Heron Lakes include Crunch Fitness, the Fish Joint, Lefty\u2019s Tavern &amp; Grille, Club Men Barbershop, Pasquale &amp; Son\u2019s Pizza Co. and Aldo Cleaners.\nShoppes at Heron Lakes traded for nearly $48 million more than its prior sale price two decades ago, reflecting continued investor confidence in South Florida\u2019s retail sector.\nIn other recent Miami Beach commercial trades,\nComras Company\n, led by Michael Comras, this month acquired a portfolio of Lincoln Road retail buildings for about\n$140 million\n, partially financed with a $117 million loan from San Francisco-based Acore Capital. Comras plans to renovate the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road.",

        "content": "Garland\nis sketching out one of North Texas\u2019 biggest\nsuburban makeovers\n, drafting a long-range blueprint to transform Lake Ray Hubbard shoreline into a string of mixed-use projects.\nThe proposal to develop the 820-acre site could add more than $1 billion in taxable value to the northeast Dallas suburb over the next several decades, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. City staff presented \u201cSetting Sail: South Garland Lakeside Area Plan\u201d to the Garland Plan Commission late last month. Commissioners voted to advance the plan, setting up a Dec. 1 briefing with the City Council and a Dec. 16 vote. Approval would give staff the green light to begin rezoning the area.\nThe framework divides the site \u2014 a small peninsula stretching into the lake, spanning the Interstate 30 and State Highway 190 interchange, across the lake from the\nstrained Sapphire Bay development\nin Rowlett \u2014 into five districts, each with its own development strategy. The effort is driven in part by the future extension of the President George Bush Turnpike, which could wipe out several existing businesses and crack open redevelopment opportunities, according to planning director Nabila Nur.\nThe plan calls for long-term urban regeneration, such as a broader housing mix, better lakefront access, upgraded trails, and more community amenities. Some of the land is city-owned, but a patchwork of private parcels and already-developed sites will complicate how fast the pieces come together.\nOfficials estimate the full buildout could stretch 30 to 50 years.\nZion Point, the first focal area, is envisioned as a hub for new residential options alongside future retail and commercial development, adding an estimated $236 million in taxable value. Plans for North Point involve a lakefront commercial strip and improved connections to I-30 and Marvin Loving Road. That area could produce roughly $114 million in value.\nSouth Point, positioned as a town-center style subdistrict, could generate an estimated $254 million in potential value. Windsurf Bay, the area most in flux due to the turnpike extension, could either stay as-is or evolve into a recreation-anchored district with residential and educational uses, adding up to $307 million. The fifth node, Locust Grove, could generate about $103 million via mobility upgrades and higher-density residential or mixed-use development.\nThe lakefront redo is just one piece of Garland\u2019s redevelopment push. This summer the council\nrezoned 317 acres\nnorth of Interstate 635 for a dense, mixed-use community. Garland was poised to partner with Atl\u00e9tico Dallas on a\n$71 million soccer complex\n, but the city abruptly scrapped the deal in September.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

The 1.9-acre site, known as School Street Plaza, will feature 41 income-restricted units for households earning up to 80 percent of\nMarin County\n\u2019s area median income.\nThe conditional go-ahead was characterized by resident opposition and even a recall election targeting Mayor Lisel Blash and Vice Mayor Stephanie Hellman.\nLocals derided the project\nfor its height, density and potential wildfire-evacuation implications. Blash and Hellman faced criticism for purportedly not doing enough to stop the project from moving forward.\nThe long road to approval came after a legal back and forth between town planning director Jeffrey Beiswenger and Mill Creek attorney Riley Hurd. Beiswenger initially told Mill Creek in July that the project didn\u2019t qualify for ministerial processing because it sat in a high-fire-severity zone and would displace tenants. He reversed course in September, though that didn\u2019t last long, as he issued a letter the following month listing 25 deficiencies with the project that brought it out of compliance. Mill Creek argued that the Town of Fairfax had passed its statutory deadline to act and that the development was already approved by operation of law.\nBlash and Hellman fired back, weeks before the recall election against them. \u201cLet\u2019s be crystal clear: Fairfax followed the law, and this project was not approved,\u201d Blash said. Hellman stated that \u201cFairfax has values, and we intend to uphold them.\u201d\nThe timing was convenient, and now Blash and Hellman have seemingly thrown their arms up, saying that denying the project could lead to bigger problems for the town down the line.\n\u201cCalifornia law imposes significant risk on local jurisdictions that deny housing projects. The Department of Housing and Community Development has issued a warning of revoking the town\u2019s housing element compliance related to this application. The risk of the\nunthinkable builder\u2019s remedy\nis very high should we lose our housing element certification,\u201d Hellman told the Independent Journal.\nUnder its approved\nhousing element\n, the Town of Fairfax must zone for 490 new units of housing by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller was a trust tied to late billionaire media titan\nSumner Redstone\nand two other trusts tied to his daughter,\nShari Redstone\n, also a media executive.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the city was in the Flatiron District.\nOlmstead Properties\npaid $104 million for two office buildings at\n381 and 373 Park Avenue South\n. The seller was\nATCO Properties\n.\nEmpire Capital\nwent into contract earlier this year to purchase the properties, but instead it has retained a small stake in them. The property at 381 Park Avenue South stands 17 stories tall and spans 244,000 square feet, and the 12-story 373 Park Avenue South spans about 112,000 square feet.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAt\nOne High Line\nin Chelsea,\nWitkoff Group\nand\nAccess Industries\nsold another sponsor unit at its new development at\n500 West 18th Street\nin Chelsea.\nJiny Prime Properties LLC\ndropped $11.8 million on a more than 3,000-square-foot unit with four bedrooms and four and a half baths. The transaction pencils out to about $3,900 per square foot. Corcoran\u2019s\nDeborah Kern\nand\nSteve Gold\nhad the listing. The unit\u2019s original asking price, back in 2022, was just under $13 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nCompass broker\nClayton Orrigo\nparted with a corner co-op at the Hudson Mews Cooperative at\n256 West 10th Street\nin the West Village for $4.3 million. The buyers were\nThomas and Susan Whitesell.\nThomas Whitesell is the head of the debt investment group at Kennedy Wilson. The pad has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Orrigo purchased the unit in 2017 for $2.1 million and renovated it, according to StreetEasy.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Lenox Hill, a co-op at\n956 Fifth Avenue\nchanged hands for $9 million. The full-floor home, which had not been on the market for five decades, has five bedrooms and four bathrooms.\u00a0 It went on the market in June for just under $9 million.

The seller of the 20-unit, four-story building was an LLC tied to\nHaskell Real Estate\n. The buyer was an LLC linked to\nBahram Hakakian\u2019s Allied Realty &amp; Development\n. The property has been in the Haskell family for decades. There do not appear to be any vacant units at the complex, but earlier this year a two-bedroom pad was listed for $5,600 a month.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. industrial rents climb 6% as vacancy inches up\nAcross the U.S., rents for\nindustrial assets\nrose nearly 6 percent year over year to reach $8.73 per square foot in October.\nNone of the top markets saw rent fall over the past year. But the sector\u2019s rental growth comes as the vacancy rate also increased, by 240 basis points, over the past 12 months to 9.6 percent amid increased inventory, according to\nYardi Matrix\u2019s November industrial report\n.\nThe market that recorded the strongest year-over-year rent growth was Miami, where the average rent in October was $12.91 per square foot, a roughly 9 percent spike. The vacancy rate in that market was just over 11 percent.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "The last decade has seen New York City\u2019s luxury market overtaken by its biggest rivals.\nA\nreport from Redfin\nshows how the Big Apple\u2019s market has stood stagnant in the last decade as prices in the Sun Belt and South Florida surged.\nBetween October 2015 and October 2025, luxury home prices in New York have hardly budged, rising just 15 percent in the same time period to $4.1 million. The market notched the smallest growth among major metropolitan areas, followed by Houston with over 49 percent luxury price growth.\nOn the leaderboard were West Palm Beach and Miami, where prices grew by over 187 percent and 148 percent to hit just over $4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nThe Sunshine State\u2019s ascent among the country\u2019s top luxury markets has been well-documented, riding a wealth migration sparked first by the 2017 tax regulation changes and exacerbated during the pandemic supported a wave of activity and a boom in new development.\n\u201cThe luxury market has expanded far beyond its traditional boundaries,\u201d\u00a0 Redfin\u2019s Head of Economic Research, Chen Zhao, said in a statement. \u201cThe priciest homes used to be more concentrated in a smaller number of East and West Coast metros. Today, high-end wealth is increasingly distributed across the Sun Belt \u2014 from Florida to Texas to Arizona.\u201d\nThe discrepancy in growth rates could be a sign that the luxury market across the five boroughs is just more mature \u2014 it didn\u2019t have the same growth potential because prices had already hit a reasonable ceiling.\nBut other metrics included in the report indicate that market maturity isn\u2019t the only explanation. In the platform\u2019s rankings of luxury markets, New York fell from No. 2 in 2015 to No. 6 in 2025, slipping behind San Francisco, which claimed the top spot in both years, Los Angeles and Miami.\n\u201cNew York\u2019s luxury housing market was already cooling before the pandemic as new taxes on high-priced homes and a flood of new condo developments tempered demand,\u201d the report explains. \u201cWhen the pandemic hit, that slowdown deepened as wealthy buyers fled the city for larger suburban or Sun Belt homes and foreign investment dried up.\u201d\nDespite its 10-year downward trend, the city could be\npreparing for a rebound\n, if last month\u2019s deal prices are any indication. Luxury home prices rose 10 percent in October compared to the same month last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nAlexander Zakharin,\na broker and real estate content creator\n, is the newest addition to a team at Ryan Serhant\u2019s eponymous brokerage.\nZakharin, who counts roughly 1 million followers across his Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts, has joined a team led by Nile Lundgren, a broker who was featured on the first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOwning Manhattan.\u201d\nBefore teaming up with Lundgren, Zakharin was an agent with Compass for just six months after a two-and-a-half-year stint with Nest Seekers, the brokerage where Serhant began his real estate career.\nLundgren is bringing on a new team member just in time for the premiere of the\nsecond season\nof \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d which follows Serhant and brokers with his firm. The show\u2019s eight episodes will be available starting Friday, Dec. 5.\nEarlier this month, the streaming service released a sneak peek of the season, which featured a new cast member, Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, who heads sales at some of the city\u2019s buzziest new developments such as Naftali\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf.\nPreviously with Corcoran\n, Zaitzeff was also one of agents behind a $60 million deal for a penthouse at 150 Charles, which set the record for the most expensive condo ever sold in Downtown Manhattan.\nInside a New York courtroom\u2026\nDisgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother, Alon Alexander, were back\nin a New York federal courtroom\nthis week, ahead of their sex trafficking trial set to begin in January.\nTheir appearance came days after prosecutors dropped a fourth indictment against the trio, adding a new charge accusing Oren of sexually exploiting a minor in 2009. In total, the government has brought 11 charges against one or more of the brothers.\nThe latest indictment also broadened the scope of the conspiracy charge. Prosecutors now claim the alleged \u201csex trafficking scheme\u201d stretched from 2008 to 2021, pushing the start date back by a year.\nDefense attorneys on Monday pushed back against the government\u2019s proposed witness list, which included 17 alleged victims whose accounts don\u2019t form the basis of standalone charges but would instead be used to support the conspiracy count or a history of alleged sexual assault.\nTwo of those victims were taken off the list, and United States District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said that while prosecutors can choose how to pare down their case, she won\u2019t allow all of the remaining witnesses to take the stand during the trial.\nThe brothers are due back in court on Tuesday, when Caproni will hear arguments over whether the newly added charge against Oren should be separated from the rest \u2014 a response to the defense\u2019s argument that it came too close to trial \u2014 and the inclusion of certain expert witnesses.\n",

        "content": "Two of New York\u2019s most prominent multifamily landlords have been hit with two foreclosure suits targeting their portfolios.\nLenders filed for foreclosure on two portfolios connected to investors Peter Hungerford and Arthur Haruvi. The portfolios together comprise 31 multifamily buildings in Manhattan. Entities associated with Hungerford and Haruvi took out a total of $173.4 million in loans against the two portfolios, but didn\u2019t pay them back by their June maturity date.\nHungerford said he was \u201cshocked\u201d the lenders filed the suits, saying the investors were in the midst of negotiating mezzanine financing and an extension to the loans.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend why they chose to do this,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cI hope we can come up with a reasonable agreement to push forward with the extension and the mezz agreement that we\u2019d already fully negotiated.\u201d\nRialto Capital Advisors, a special servicer associated with the plaintiffs on one of the cases, has gained a reputation for using\nscorched-earth tactics on a number of borrowers\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this year. The servicer has previously maintained it is playing by the rules and only goes after borrowers in \u201crare instances.\u201d An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe investors have been ready to refinance the portfolio Rialto was servicing, Hungerford said, but family legal disputes have gotten in the way. In 2022, Haruvi reorganized the family assets. He\nbrought in Hungerford\nto take on a stake and manage the portfolio. But Michelle Haruvi, Arthur Haruvi\u2019s daughter, sued her father and Hungerford, alleging she had been unfairly cut out of the family companies. The case was\ninitially dismissed\nbut\nrevived on appeal\n. Arthur Haruvi could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\u201cI, as the sponsor and manager of this deal, have done an excellent job managing the properties and improving the condition of the properties,\u201d Hungerford said.\u2029\u201dBut because of the family disputes, we\u2019ve been unable to refinance.\u201d\nHungerford and Haruvi are named as defendants in the suits because they served as limited guarantors on the loans. The lenders are seeking judgments to collect at least some losses from Hungerford and Haruvi personally if portfolio sales don\u2019t cover the debt, alleging the two are liable because the borrower failed to make certain deposits. Hungerford, however, said the property is worth more than the loan.\nThe investors\u2019 Midtown West portfolio, serviced by Rialto, comprises 18 buildings in the blocks between West 54th and 57th streets, and between Eighth and Tenth avenues on the West Side. The other portfolio is made up of 13 buildings across the Upper East Side, Upper West Side and Murray Hill. Notes on the two portfolios, which include rent-stabilized units, were both transferred to the plaintiffs in February.\nHungerford has become one of the city\u2019s most well-known multifamily landlords for his strategy of\nbuying up rent-stabilized buildings\n. The buildings have been considered deteriorating assets by many in the industry after statewide legislation made it harder to raise the rents in regulated apartments. With buildings selling at a fraction of their peak prices, investors like Hungerford have swooped in, believing they can hold on long enough to make a profit.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Larry Ellison is set to take over more than just Paramount from Shari Redstone.\nThe founder and former CEO of Oracle bought two units from trusts tied to Redstone and her late father, Sumner Redstone, at the Pierre Hotel for $24 million, according to public records.\nSkydance Media, run by Ellison\u2019s son David Ellison, acquired Paramount parent company National Amusements for over $8 billion in a deal that closed earlier this year. The elder Ellison was later reported to be replacing Shari as the media giant\u2019s largest shareholder.\nThe wealthy families have apparently continued their wheeling and dealing. Ellison purchased Unit 2508 for $10.1 million and Unit 2501 for $13.9 million with the same trust that is taking control of Paramount\u2019s licensed television broadcast stations. Both deals appear to have occurred off-market.\nEllison has apparently not been scared off by the recent controversy swirling around the hotel, which includes private units for purchase.\nResidents at 795 Fifth Avenue\nsued the co-op board earlier this month over a proposed $2 billion sale\nof the building that they claim would have them vacate their apartments and lose their share of the proceeds.\nThe complaint claims the co-op board struck a term sheet in September with an unidentified LLC allegedly tied to the Khashoggi family, which would fold the building into the Brunei-owned Dorchester Collection.\nThe uproar included high-profile owners like fashion designer Tory Burch, a named plaintiff, against United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who bought the penthouse for $44 million in 2017 and\nallegedly helped prepare the building for a sale\n.\nOpened in 1930, J. Paul Getty bought the Pierre eight years later and turned it into a cooperative in 1959. In 2005, the building underwent a $100 million renovation and now serves as a luxury hotel with private homes.\nResidents complaining of deteriorating maintenance and services hasn\u2019t stopped high-profile buyers from staking a claim in the historic building.\nIn March, former Disney chief executive officer Michael Eisner bought a $4.3 million apartment. In a sign of its waning value, Eisner paid the same price the seller bought it for in 2004.\nBeyond dropping $8 billion for the media company, Ellison has been on a bit of a buying spree himself. Earlier this week, an entity tied to the Larry Ellison Foundation\npaid $30 million for a 254-acre wildlife park in Palm Beach.\nLast year, Ellison also bought an eight-acre oceanfront resort in Manalapan, Fla. for over $277 million following his $173 million purchase of an estate in the same wealthy enclave in 2022.\n",

The path for refiling is unclear, however, as the DOJ\u2019s prosecutor was ruled ineligible to bring the indictments again.\nA federal grand jury\nindicted\nJames last month. Allegations included marking on a mortgage application that a house she and her niece bought in Virginia would be a primary residence, misrepresenting the number of units at a row house in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and falsifying documents to secure better mortgage terms.\nJames\u2019 legal team argued the case was part of a \u201cpolitical retribution campaign.\u201d\nHundreds of city influencers are thankful to be part of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s transition team. That includes\ntwo dozen people\non his transition committee for housing.\nThe housing group includes nonprofit housing organizations, union reps, YIMBY groups, religious leaders, tenant groups, private real estate developers and multifamily lenders. Representatives from the private sector include Real Estate Board of New York Chair and Two Trees Management CEO Jed Walentas, L+M CEO Lisa Gomez and M Squared COO Carolee Fink.\nMembers of the committee also include veterans of the de Blasio and Bloomberg administrations. Notably, The Partnership for New York\u2019s Kathy Wylde is on another committee and five representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America were named to different committees.\nAbramson Brothers is thankful for the\n467m tax incentive program\n, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting office buildings into apartments.\nAbramson is\nconverting\nits 90,000-square-foot office building at 333 West 52nd Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen into a 108-unit residential property; architecture firm CetraRuddy is leading the redesign.\nThis represents the longtime office landlord\u2019s first office-to-residential conversion. Amenities will include a fitness center and a terrace.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is thankful these days. Turkeys, for one, probably aren\u2019t loving this holiday, nor are air traffic controllers.\nThe same could be said for brokers and owners\nfearful of a bill\nworking its way through the city.\nThe Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is a proposed measure that would grant city-approved nonprofits first dibs to buy buildings with three or more residential units.\nOpponents, including brokers and property owners, are not pleased, arguing the bill will \u201cdisrupt the city\u2019s housing market,\u201d bring transactions to a crawl, deter investors and lenders due to delayed closings and preclude time-sensitive 1031 exchanges.\nProponents, however, are gobbling it up, saying COPA will curb speculation and help nonprofits create and preserve affordable housing for low-income tenants.\nIt\u2019s a fight that doesn\u2019t appear likely to be settled at the Thanksgiving table.\n",

        "content": "Robert A.M. Stern, the renowned architect and founder of the eponymous firm that shaped Manhattan\u2019s luxury residential landscape, has died.\nHe was 86. His death followed a brief pulmonary illness, his son told the\nNew York Times\n.\nStern told\nThe Real Deal\nin a 2009 interview\nthat he \u201cannounced\u201d his intention to be an architect around the age of 14, and as a child was \u201cbusy playing with blocks, making drawings of hypothetical cities.\u201d\nHe went on to earn a Bachelor\u2019s in History from Columbia University in 1960 and a master\u2019s degree in architecture from Yale University in 1965. (He later served as dean of the Yale School of Architecture from 1998 to 2016.)\nHe founded\nRobert A.M. Stern Architects\nin 1969, and shaped the firm with an emphasis on incorporating architectural history and\n\u201cthe complexities of place.\u201d\nThe New York-based firm was behind commercial and civic projects, but made its mark in history with a rare combination of commercial and design acclaim at\n15 Central Park West\n.\nThe luxury residential building developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf known as the most successful condominium in New York City history. Dubbed \u201cLimestone Jesus\u201d for its facade\u2019s distinct nod to prewar grandeur, the property attracted buyers including celebrities and Manhattan power players who sold the building out before it completed construction.\nThe firm designed 15 Central Park West, the limestone condominium where total sales topped $2 billion, making it the most successful apartment building in the world.\nElsewhere in Manhattan, the firm made its mark on the luxury market with the\nSuperior Ink Condominiums in the West Village\n,\n30 Park Place in Lower Manhattan\nand\nthe Chatham on the Upper East Side\n, where Stern was a resident until his death.\nOutside of New York City, the firm was also behind a number of commercial projects, including Philadelphia\u2019s Comcast Center skyscraper, residential colleges at Yale University and the George W. Bush Presidential Library in Dallas, Texas.\nStern\u2019s work has been the subject of 20 books and included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Paris\u2019 Centre Pompidou, among others, according to a bio on his firm\u2019s website.\nOn the subject of being deemed a \u201cstarchitect,\u201d he told\nTRD\nin 2009 that he would differentiate the \u201cstar status\u201d of certain architects from the acclaim awarded most movie stars.\n\u201cWe\u2019re much more interesting than movie stars and much more important, and what we do is much more enduring,\u201d Stern said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the movie you\u2019re watching, you can turn it off or walk out of the theater, or fall asleep. I do all of those things. But if it\u2019s a building and it\u2019s across the street from your window and it\u2019s an abomination, what are you going to do about it? Not much.\u201d",

        "content": "The classic Soho loft drama begins in the 1970s with artists moving into buildings that no one else wants.\nThen the neighborhood gentrifies, and the artists battle real estate professionals trying to oust them from properties that have become extremely valuable.\nThat story is playing out at 36 Greene Street, but with an ironic twist: The holdout renter, Alexander Riguardi, isn\u2019t a peer of\nPatti Smith\nbut a commercial real estate broker who arrived five years ago. The landlords seeking to oust him were the original tenants.\nRiguardi is the son of Peter Riguardi, JLL\u2019s New York region chairman and president. His landlords are Antonio Morello and\nDonato Savoie\n\u2014 the founding architects of\nStudio MORSA\n\u2014 and artist\nTheodosius \u201cTed\u201d Victoria\n. They purchased the five-story, five-unit building in 1977 from the estate of Westchester landlord Anna Donovan.\nCity records show they paid $75,000. Today it would sell for about $15 million.\nBut only if they can get Riguardi out.\nHumble beginnings\nThe three men had scratched together $27,000 in the late 1970s and got a mortgage from the seller for the $48,000 balance. Victoria, the artist, who was less than a decade into what has been a 60-year career, signed for the buyers. Their monthly payment was $379.\nFive years later, in 1982, the state\npassed the Loft Law\n, allowing owners of Soho lofts to collect rent while converting them to legal residences. The law also locked in low rents for tenants, but let landlords deregulate units if they could buy out the occupants.\nSoho at the time was a gritty, even dangerous industrial area. No one anticipated that it would become among the most coveted neighborhoods in the city, or that the Loft Law would spur intense, protracted landlord-tenant disputes and a cottage industry of lawyers.\nOne reason was that the statute allows tenants to pay little or no rent until the owner gets a certificate of occupancy and gives them tools to stall the process for years. They can challenge renovation plans and submit their own, using delay as leverage to maximize buyouts.\nLoft owners, if they can get through these headaches, also have the potential to make a killing. Soaring demand to live in Soho, which has supercharged rents, pushed owners to create as many free-market units as possible.\nThe three owners of 36 Greene Street avoided this madness, in part because they were their own tenants. Morello and Victoria registered 36 Greene Street in February 1983 with the newly created Loft Board, triggering a timeline for them to get the building up to code and obtain a certificate of occupancy. Savoie amended the filing that September.\nAfter that, things went sideways. One year ran into the next without the owners doing the renovations and paperwork needed to get a residential certificate of occupancy.\nIn 1996, they had a brush with disaster: The building was pulled into the city\u2019s tax lien sale. It was released a year later, and in 1999, the owners finished paying their $48,000 mortgage.\nIn 1982 and again in 2000, their ownership entity was dissolved, suggesting disagreements among the three partners. Each dissolution was later annulled, state records show.\nOne problem lingered: The owners, despite having two architects and a successful artist among them, never legalized the building.\nIn 2006, the Loft Board brought a case against 36 Greene for being out of compliance with the Multiple Dwelling Law. The owners settled the case in 2007, paying a $10,000 fine and agreeing to a new legalization timeline \u2014 which they did not meet.\nMost surprisingly, the owners apparently did not realize the risk of renting Apartment 3 to Alex Riguardi in 2020. Tenants are famously well protected by New York laws, and none more so than those in regulated loft apartments.\nRiguardi\u2019s unit spanned the entire third floor of the elegant brick building at the corner of Grand Street \u2014 prime Soho. Morello had the young broker pay half the $7,250 rent to him and the other half to the LLC that owned the building.\nThe lease provided the landlords an immediate revenue boost, but would come back to haunt them.\nThe holdout\nRiguardi was nothing like the original tenants of 36 Greene Street or other starving artists of 1970s Soho, a raw neighborhood that had lost its manufacturers to the scourge of deindustrialization.\nAs a Michigan State freshman in 2014, he and two classmates had\ncreated an app\nto drive inebriated Hamptons and Jersey Shore partiers home. The effort earned them a feature story in the New York Post but petered out a couple of years later. Riguardi\u2019s road to riches, like his father\u2019s, would be in real estate, albeit by a route he never expected.\nRiguardi began his career in traditional fashion for kids who can tap into a parent\u2019s network. He landed summer analyst positions in 2016 and 2017 at JPMorgan and Tishman Speyer, the kind of gigs that are much easier to get if you have connections.\nAlex\u2019s father certainly had connections. Peter had followed his own father into the business at GVA Williams Real Estate in 1983, co-founding what would become Colliers International in 1994 and joining JLL in 2002.\nAlex joined his father\u2019s firm upon graduating in 2018 and had been promoted twice by the time he leased the full-floor unit at 36 Greene Street from Morello.\nThis was late 2020, when the market was still reeling from Covid, and Morello was not convinced that the 24-year-old could pay the $7,250 rent on his own. Riguardi, however, had something that Soho tenants of the 1970s lacked: a wealthy father to guarantee the lease. Dad hand-wrote his address on the agreement as 212 Fifth Avenue, a Nomad condominium where units\nfetch more than $10 million\n.\nNine months later, his son would purchase a summer home, nabbing a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house with a\nheated pool\non 1.3 acres in East Hampton. Alex Riguardi paid\n$1.65 million\nfor a property that today would fetch nearly $2.2 million, according to Trulia.\nRiguardi had no idea that his Soho lease would soon be worth more than that. The deal with Morello, unbeknownst to its signatories, was a golden ticket. The only question was when it could be cashed in.\nThe answer came late last year when the owners decided to punch their own ticket.\nTime to sell\nThe three men, now in their 70s or 80s, had watched their building appreciate more than they could possibly have imagined. It had 69 feet of frontage on Greene Street and 20 on Grand Avenue, four full-floor apartments and a ground-floor commercial space in one of the city\u2019s richest retail corridors.\nExcept for the fact that one or more of them still live in the building, there was no reason to wait any longer. It was time to sell.\nThey hoped to find a condo developer who would pay $15 million or more, but to get that price, they would need to deliver the building empty. That meant Riguardi had to go. Morello served him with the required 90-day notice that his lease would not be renewed.\nRiguardi\u2019s experience was in commercial real estate, not tenants\u2019 rights, so he did not initially realize the tremendous leverage he enjoyed. But he knew enough to consult a knowledgeable attorney, something Morello apparently failed to do before leasing the unit.\nRiguardi\u2019s lawyer, Gregory Byrnes, had his client apply to the Loft Board for status as a protected loft tenant, an obscure but enormously consequential designation. The application was dated Feb. 28, the final day of Riguardi\u2019s lease.\nIf granted, it would entitle the silver-spooned JLL broker with the Hamptons house to stay in his $8,400 apartment for just a few hundred dollars a month. Eat your heart out, Zohran Mamdani.\nBecause the owners had never bought out a previous occupant of the third floor, they cannot charge its tenant anywhere close to what Riguardi was paying. Instead, it would be what the unit went for when the building was registered in the 1980s, plus three increases totaling 20 percent.\nThe new rent might be $600 or less, according to people familiar with the situation. Riguardi has asked the Loft Board to come up with a number.\nThen, after the building gets a certificate of occupancy, Apartment 3 would become rent-stabilized, subject only to the minimal increases allowed each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. Riguardi and his descendants could, in theory, remain in the low-rent unit for the rest of this century, forcing a developer to work around them.\nRent-free living\nTechnically, Riguardi can live there rent-free until the owners legalize the building, because the owners missed the deadline to do so. Protected-rent status would also entitle Riguardi to claw back about 95 percent of the approximately $450,000 he has paid his landlords.\nThe owners, who belatedly tapped Loft Law attorney Michael Bobick to represent them, have challenged Riguardi\u2019s application for protected status. Their filing notes that he arrived 38 years after the Loft Law took effect and did not provide proof of rent payments or that 36 Greene Street was his primary residence. The non-renewal notice, they say, establishes that Riguardi no longer resides in the building with the owners\u2019 consent.\nThe Loft Board is not likely to be persuaded.\nAlthough loft tenants\u2019 protections were geared for 1980s occupants in unfinished buildings, not trust-fund kids paying $8,400 a month, Riguardi appears to qualify. That would entitle him to reimbursement for rent overcharges, and more importantly, the right to stay in Apartment 3.\nAs a legal occupant, Riguardi could drag out the legalization for years \u2014 something loft tenants have mastered by objecting to landlords\u2019 renovation plans. As a commercial broker for a publicly traded brokerage, it might not be in his professional interest to do so, but the potential is there.\nThe owners of 36 Greene Street would have to start virtually from scratch because, after registering the building as a loft, they never registered any tenants or filed a narrative describing how they would bring it up to code.\nThe lawyers for both sides declined to comment.\nThe owners have no interest in keeping Riguardi in place, but did ask what it would take to buy him out. He came back with a number close to $4 million. It\u2019s a bitter pill that the owners don\u2019t want to swallow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unfair for who he is,\u201d said one person familiar with the situation, calling it \u201clegal extortion.\u201d\nBut the key word is \u201clegal.\u201d\nAt first blush, it does seem unfair that the folks who nurtured a building for half a century, from near worthlessness to trophy status, must now cede millions of dollars of their gain to a five-year tenant who comes from money.\nAnd it certainly makes no sense that someone who, on his own free will, has been paying $8,400 a month should have his rent reset to $600 based on what people paid in 1983.\nOn the other hand, real estate operates by rules, no matter how arcane. Had the owners followed them, none of this would have happened. Savoie, Morello and Victoria never took the basic step of registering Riguardi or other tenants, if there were any.\n\u201cI can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why someone didn\u2019t give them guidance \u2026 to make sure their paperwork was all in order,\u201d said one real estate executive.\nBecause the building is in a residential zone, R7X, they had another option as well: \u201cAt any point in the 40 years, they could have \u2026 deregistered it with Loft Board and gotten a residential C of O,\u201d the executive said.\nThese were not naive newcomers, but grizzled New Yorkers and longtime Soho residents. Two were architects \u2014 partners with three decades of experience. They had plenty of time to legalize their building and no tenants standing in their way.\nUntil now.\n",
