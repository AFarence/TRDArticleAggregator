        "content": "\u201cYou need a building that actually works, not a building that just checks a lot of boxes.\u201d\nScott Short, former RiseBoro CEO\nOne failure of the real estate industry is clinging to LEED certification as the standard for eco-friendly buildings.\nLEED was all the rage for a while and remains the most popular way for owners to showcase how \u201cgreen\u201d their buildings are. But with carbon emissions now dwarfing other environmental concerns, what matters most is how efficient buildings are at heating and cooling.\nOperating costs are also crucial, especially for affordable housing.\nLEED does not ignore these metrics, but some of the ways developers rack up\nLEED points\nto achieve certification have little to do with them.\nScott Short knew this 15 years ago when he set out to build the state\u2019s first passive house multifamily building: a 24-unit affordable project with day care at\n803 Knickerbocker Avenue\nfor the Brooklyn-based nonprofit now named RiseBoro. (The honor ultimately went to\nanother RiseBoro project\nthat he started later but finished sooner.)\n\u201cWe were trying to do something new, to break the mold,\u201d said Short. \u201cOne of the things that attracted me to the passive house standard was, unlike LEED or these \u2018green building\u2019 [designations] where you get certified based on plans, with passive house it\u2019s really all about the performance of the building.\u201d\nAt the end of construction, a\nblower door test\ndetermines how leaky the building is.\n\u201cIf the building doesn\u2019t perform as you project it to, you\u2019re not going to get the certification,\u201d said Short, who was RiseBoro\u2019s housing director and later became CEO. \u201cYou need a building that actually works, not a building that just checks a lot of boxes during the design phase.\u201d\nIn the early 2010s, no passive house apartment buildings existed in New York, and city officials who controlled affordable housing subsidies were skeptical.\n\u201cWe had to go in for funding four times,\u201d Scott recalled, \u201cand chip away at the bureaucratic hurdles.\u201d\n\nContractors were also skittish about passive house construction and inflated their bids by 20 percent, Short estimated. \u201cIt was the novelty premium,\u201d he said.\nThat premium has largely disappeared as more contractors have become comfortable with the methods, equipment and materials needed to make a building virtually airtight, with carefully controlled ventilation.\nIn New York City, most affordable projects are now built this way, although they don\u2019t often seek passive house status because the certification process is expensive. Perhaps the biggest is the 277-unit\n425 Grand Concourse\nin the Bronx, finished in 2022 by Monadnock Construction and Dattner Architects. (Outside of affordable housing, a 352-unit\nCornellTech NYC residential building\ncompleted in 2017 is among the city\u2019s passive house pioneers.)\nI checked with Short\u2019s successor as CEO,\nKieran Harrington\n, to see how 803 Knickerbocker is doing a dozen years after opening. \u201cThere have been meaningful savings,\u201d he said.\nThe six-story, 35,000-square-foot building uses about\n20 percent as much energy\nas an average building of that size in the city. Its annual cost for gas, electricity and water is 62 cents per square foot, about half of the Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $1.12 benchmark.\nBut the benefits of the super-insulated building go well beyond cost savings, according to its architect, Chris Benedict.\n\u201cNot only do we have a very good air barrier on the exterior of the building to meet passive house [standards], we also create an air barrier between each apartment so that air, bugs, smoke, sound, none of these things can pass from one apartment to the other,\u201d she said in a\nYouTube video\n.\nBuildings guru Henry Gifford was a consultant on 803 Knickerbocker. His role, in part, was to ease the anxiety of its contractors. As the construction team met near the end of the project, a plumber worried about being blamed if the 400,000 BTU boiler proved too small to heat a 24-unit building.\nGifford didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThe boiler is not going to provide the heat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to provide the heat\nand the hot water\n.\u201d\n\u201cNobody doubted I was taking full responsibility,\u201d Gifford recalled, \u201cand everyone calmed down.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rule number one: Know your audience. Rule number two: Answer the question you want to answer, not necessarily the question asked.\nAt least that is the playbook I assume mayoral hopefuls were following as they made their case to an industry-heavy crowd on Wednesday morning at a\nforum\nheld by Crain\u2019s. Candidates abided by the second rule to varying degrees, though the moderators did their best to keep them on track.\nEach of the candidates took turns on the stage to talk about a range of topics, including property tax reform and housing policy. Because this wasn\u2019t a debate and the candidates weren\u2019t presented with the same questions, I\u2019m not going to compare the candidates\u2019 performances.\nInstead, here are superlatives for the real estate-related topics covered during the forum:\nMost likely to make landlords\u2019 heads explode:\nThe \u201crent-stabilized landlords make too much money\u201d claim\nAssembly member Zohran Mamdani said the Rent Guidelines Board\u2019s own data on landlord profits should result in a rent freeze for stabilized tenants. Every year when this data comes out, landlord groups\npoint out\nthat the RGB\u2019s Income and Expense report includes market-rate units and leaves out a slew of other costs. In other words, the number is not an accurate picture of how rent-stabilized owners are faring.\nNot to mention, the RGB already recommends ranges based on its own data, and these ranges tend to make both tenants and landlords unhappy.\nMost likely to make Yimbys throw their copies of \u201cOn the Housing Crisis\u201d against the wall:\nThe ballot questions dodge and low-density exceptions\nNone of the mayoral candidates gave a glowing endorsement of\nthese measures\non Wednesday. In fact, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa vehemently opposes them, referring to the proposals as \u201cCity of Yes on steroids.\u201d\nCuomo wasn\u2019t asked (but his reps have called the proposals a\n\u201cno brainer\u201d\n), and Mamdani said he hasn\u2019t taken a position. This was after he said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the idea that one of the biggest costs developers face is caused by time passing, projects dragging. One of the biggest themes of those ballot measures is cutting approval timelines.\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nAt one point, Crain\u2019s reporter Nick Garber asked Cuomo about a line in his housing plan that states that low-density neighborhoods should be spared from rezonings, \u201cwith limited exceptions such as transit-oriented development,\u201d until \u201cthe impact of recent rezoning efforts are absorbed in these areas.\u201d\nInitially, Cuomo rejected the idea, saying that what he has said is \u201cyou have to take the characteristics of a neighborhood into consideration.\u201d Then, he was helpfully reminded of the above quotes in his housing plan and said, \u201cI get this political sensitivity, and I get the City of Yes and what everybody went through, but it\u2019s going to be on a case-by-case basis, and all of it is going to be hard, by the way.\u201d I reiterate:\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nMost likely to earn points with real estate and other business leaders:\nThe Michael Bloomberg name drop\nIf I had a nickel for every time a real estate source has spoken wistfully of the Bloomberg administration, I would have\u2026I don\u2019t know, $7?\nIn any case, mentions of the former mayor fall into the previously mentioned \u201cknow your audience\u201d rule. All three candidates mentioned an aspect of Bloomberg\u2019s approach to being mayor that they admire and/or want to replicate.\nMost likely to grab headlines because, holy cow, someone actually made news at this thing:\nThe Rikers reboot\nThere\u2019s nothing like the excitement of an event where a speaker breaks news, until you realize that another publication was given the news the day before under embargo. I\u2019m not bitter.\n\nCuomo announced that as mayor, he would abandon plans to close Rikers and build four borough-based jails. Instead, he would rebuild Rikers and use the four sites for housing and commercial use.\nThe New York Times was first to report the proposal.\nMost likely to make\nTRD\neditors say \u201cWait, what?\u201d:\nThe \u201csimultaneous\u201d housing pledge\nCuomo said his first big project as mayor would be to build 500,000 housing units across 300 sites \u201csimultaneously.\u201d That \u201csimultaneously\u201d raises a lot of questions, but most critically: How?\nMost likely to be harder than it looks:\nProperty tax reform\nCall me pessimistic, but a lot of mayors have promised to tackle this issue, and it hasn\u2019t happened. The candidates didn\u2019t offer up specifics, though Cuomo said he believes the courts will have to force the city and state to the table. More on that\nhere\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNow that Pacific Park has a\nnew development team\n, how will the vision for the remaining sites change? Who will pay for a platform over the rail yard? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Less than two months after the Midtown South rezoning, an office-to-residential conversion in the neighborhood is already in the works. Sheridan Wall\nreports\nthat Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger paid $25 million for 29 West 35th Street with plans to convert it into 107 studio apartments.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Outdoor gear and clothing store REI is closing its Soho flagship store in 2026,\nCurbed reports\n. Stores in Paramus, N.J., and Boston, Mass., are also closing next year.\n\u2014 The NYPD\u2019s highest-ranking uniformed officer, Chief of Department John Chell, is retiring after less than a year in the role,\nGothamist reports\n. Chief Michael LiPetri will assume the position on an interim basis.\n\u2014Three state judges filed a lawsuit this week challenging New York\u2019s mandatory retirement age for judges,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The state constitution caps the age for judges at 70.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a pre-war cooperative unit at 1100 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Jane R. Andrews and John Cronin of Coldwell Banker Warburg\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.5 million\nfor a 33,374-square-foot, mixed-use property at 6 Greene Street in Soho. It has six stories and 12 residential units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 4,603-square-foot condominium unit at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher with CORE NYC has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 133,619-square-foot, 160-unit residential project at 525 Wales Avenue in Mott Haven in the Bronx. Esther Dockery of NBO4 Architecture filed the permit on behalf of John DiBattista.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s rental market is cooling, but not by much.\nThe median rent for a brokered apartment in Manhattan was $4,550 in September, down ever so slightly from the month before, but still up more than 8 percent over last year, according to a monthly report from appraiser Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman.\nAcross the city, rents are in a holding pattern. After beginning a streak of\nhigh prices in February\n, they\u2019ve since passed peaks and continued bobbing at the top of the chart. Although the pressures that pushed rents up are easing off, there\u2019s unlikely to be a significant decline in prices anytime soon, said Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201c[The only] economic force that could drive rents lower would be a severe recession,\u201d said Miller.\nFor the past several months,\nelevated mortgage rates have kept would-be buyers\nin the rental market, driving up demand for those units, Miller said. In July, Manhattan rents set a new all-time record at $4,700.\nMortgage rates have begun to come down slightly, and demand typically falls in autumn. But those headwinds are not enough to really turn the march of rents around, Miller said.\nThe market remains tight. Inventory in Manhattan was low for the month, at 9,244 listings, a decline of nearly 8 percent year over year. That could indicate a high number of lease renewals, Miller said. Renewals are typically at lower prices than new leases and are not captured in the report.\n\nLow turnover and high renewals may suit landlords just fine, as an uncertain economic picture makes locking in tenants look preferable to testing the market. And renters might be deciding that what they\u2019re seeing on StreetEasy just isn\u2019t worth it.\nTurnover may dip lower in the future if mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani wins the election and institutes a\npromised rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments\n. That policy could put pressure on rents in market-rate apartments, Miller said, by lowering inventory and prompting landlords to make up money on any market-rate apartments they own.\nCompetition for a unit wasn\u2019t at record highs in September, but it was still elevated. About 22 percent of leases in Manhattan were subject to bidding wars, according to Miller. That number was 23 percent in Queens and 33 percent in Brooklyn.\nMedian rent for brokered apartments in Brooklyn was $3,925 in September, just $25 lower than\nthe median in August\n. Prices have risen 7.5 percent in the last year.\nInventory was down in Brooklyn as well. At 5,681, it was 3 percent lower than in August.\nThe median rent in Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, was $3,650. That was a 4 percent increase year over year.\n",

The purchaser was an LLC linked to\nZihang Chen\n, which took out $11.3 million in financing from an affiliate of\nS3 Capital\nfor the deal. Tsang had owned the property since the early 1990s and had planned to build a residential complex there.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA sponsor unit at\n500 West 18th Street\nin Chelsea sold for just under $6 million.

        "content": "After five years without a property tax hike, Evanston homeowners are facing a potential 12.9 percent increase next year under a $342 million draft budget proposed by City Manager Luke Stowe.\nThe proposal calls for filling a $6.5 million gap in the budget with the tax increase to balance the budget and maintain city services. If approved by the City Council, the hike would raise annual tax bills for the owners of median-value properties by $174 to $400, the Chicago Tribune first\nreported\n.\nThose figures include the library\u2019s proposed levy increase and are based on 2023 Cook County tax rates, since 2024 data is not yet available.\nFor a condo valued at the city\u2019s median of $294,000, the owner would owe roughly $174 more. A single-family homeowner with a $675,000 valuation would pay about $400 more, while a\nmultifamily building owner\nwith a property worth $620,000 would see a $367 bump.\nThe proposal ends a half-decade of tax stability driven by one-time revenue sources, federal stimulus funds and inflation-fueled growth, the city manager said.\n\nThe\ncity\u2019s\nrising pension obligations for police and firefighters, guided by a new funding policy aimed at meeting state mandates by 2040, are a major cost driver.\nAlthough the proposed 12.9 percent increase applies only to the city and library\u2019s share of the tax bill, that portion makes up just 19 percent of an\nEvanston\nhomeowner\u2019s total tax load. The city said the hike would translate to a 2.4 percent rise in the total bill, with roughly two-thirds of all property tax revenue flowing to local school districts.\nEvanston\u2019s\nbudget also includes fee hikes \u2014 including $7 a month more for yard waste and bulk pickups \u2014 and $91.5 million in capital spending. Projects include nearly $32 million for street and sewer work, $17 million for park improvements across multiple sites, $11.7 million for city facility upgrades, and $7 million for an electrical reliability project at the Evanston Water Plant, funded largely by regional partners.\nPublic hearings begin next week, and a final council vote is expected later this fall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It was the third quarter\u2019s largest office transaction.\nMason Creek I, at 21420 Merchants Way, is a 135,000-square-foot office building constructed in 2013. Nicola Wealth has owned it since 2015. It\u2019s about 24 miles west of downtown Houston.\nThe property is in Houston\u2019s Katy submarket, which accounted for 7.8 percent of leasing activity in the third quarter. It ranked sixth in terms of submarkets with the largest amount of positive absorption. West Loop and the\nEnergy Corridor\ntopped the list; both logged more than 200,000 square feet of positive absorption.\nHouston\u2019s office market has been\nslow to recover from the pandemic\n, but the market indicators are gradually improving.\n\nThe metro\u2019s overall vacancy rate dropped from 27.9 percent a year ago to 27.4 percent. In the third quarter last year, the market saw\n23,700 square feet of negative absorption\n. This year, 555,000 square feet was absorbed in July through September, marking the second quarter in a row that more space was leased than vacated, marking the first sustained positive absorption since 2019, Colliers said.\nThe flight to quality office trend seen throughout the country is also at play in Houston.\nThe average vacancy of properties built in the last decade is 11.9 percent, highlighting companies\u2019 preference for newer office space with top-of-the-line amenities.\nFor example, Skanska delivered Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a 386,000-square-foot office building at 1550 Lamar Street, last year. The 28-story building is 62 percent leased, with\nThird Coast Infrastructure\nbeing the latest company to sign a deal to move into the trophy building.\n",

        "content": "A waterfront estate hit the market in Austin for $11 million, as a shrinking buyer pool pushes ultra-luxury properties onto public listing services.\nThe eight-acre property at 11941 Overlook Pass includes a 4,000-square-foot main house as well as a guest house and a saloon-styled party hall. The property is one of a few that fronts Barton Creek, a popular Austin recreational spot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to build on Barton Creek,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Jeanne Parker, who has the listing along with with Julie Mack.\nParker and Mack are expecting a buyer who values privacy and family considerations.\n\u201cThree of the best private schools in Austin are within a 10- to 15-minute drive of this property,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cA lot of celebrities live there, a lot of professional athletes, because of the privacy. They don\u2019t like drones following them around, and you can\u2019t do that here,\u201d Mack said.\n\nMost agents would prefer to market a property of this price in private. However, fewer buyers means more luxury homes are hitting the MLS, Mack said.\nAustin has one of the\nhighest median days on market\nof any luxury market in the country, according to Redfin. Toward the end of the hot season, the market overall had more than two sellers for every buyer, making Austin one of\nthe most seller-saturated markets in the country\n.\nAs a result, price cuts have become more common for luxury homes in the area. The two most expensive homes sold on the MLS last week\ncut their asking prices\nbefore selling, and one spent over 190 days on the market.\nWhile Parker and Mack are marketing the nearby schools, most people who have taken an interest in the property are retired grandparents, the agents said. Single-family properties in the area are attracting more luxury buyers than\ncondos\nare, suggesting that the tech industry\u2019s waning interest in Austin is siphoning more single, childless workers than parents back to the coast, Parker speculated.\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, we had a lot of people coming in from California, which raised the prices, and that has slowed down,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cMost of our people are coming in from New York, New Jersey, Chicago, probably for tax reasons,\u201d Mack said.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is finally trying to unload one of its biggest real estate embarrassments after years of dysfunction.\nThe city listed 7800 North Stemmons Freeway, an 11-story 228,300-square-foot office building that has cost at least $29 million in taxpayer funds after an initial purchase price of $14.1 million. CBRE is marketing the site as an \u201coutstanding redevelopment or owner-user opportunity,\u201d the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe property, built in 1981 and renovated about a decade ago, was supposed to house the city\u2019s beleaguered permitting office.\nBut according to an April after-action report from\nCity Manager\nKimberly\nTolbert\n, the building was so structurally unsound that the city couldn\u2019t even secure a certificate of occupancy. Despite sinking another $15 million into repairs, the site remains uninhabitable, forcing staff back to their old digs on East Jefferson Boulevard.\nFallout from Tolbert\u2019s report included the short-term suspension of any public real estate purchases unless previously approved by the\nCity Council\n, as well as a review of the city\u2019s working agreement with CBRE going forward and to finalize a request for proposal for a comprehensive citywide\nreal estate master plan\n.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a costly blunder to maintain: Dallas is spending roughly $73,000 a month on security and upkeep. The city recently pulled permits \u2014 totaling nearly $650,000 \u2014 to install a new fire alarm system, even as it moves to offload the property. CBRE\u2019s marketing materials highlight the building\u2019s 5-acre site, flexible zoning and proximity to the Medical District, but the listing is unpriced and being sold strictly \u201cas-is, where-is.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s decision to buy the building in 2022 was made under then\u2013City Manager\nT.C. Broadnax\n, following what Tolbert later called \u201conly a surface-level review\u201d by JLL.\nDallas officials, including Council Member Chad West, confirmed they only learned the property had quietly hit the market after inquiries from the media. CBRE broker Patrick Benoist, who worked on the deal, declined to comment to the outlet, citing instructions from his client \u2014 the city. Offers are due in about three weeks, after which the council will review its options privately.\nCommercial brokers said the property is likely a teardown, given its condition and location along the moribund Stemmons Corridor. City Hall is hoping to cut its losses and turn a costly cautionary tale into someone else\u2019s redevelopment play.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If the Florida condo crisis were a hurricane, the worst of the storm appears to have passed by Palm Beach.\nWhile the government doesn\u2019t control the weather, it does have command over the regulatory environment that created difficulties for the state\u2019s condo market. In the wake of the deadly Champlain Towers collapse in Surfside, lawmakers scrambled to prevent another tragedy with a slate of\nnew safety laws\nthat have their own consequences. The legislation mandated that condos complete milestone inspections and reserve studies. While these rules apply to every residential building 30 years or older, the effects are evolving into a story of the haves and have-nots, especially when the multimillion-dollar assessments roll in.\nAs the statewide condo market continues to absorb the shock of regulations,\nPalm Beach\n, where money is no issue, illustrates how affluent communities are better equipped to handle the impact.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s reading the same doom and gloom about this market,\u201d said Scott Gordon, a Douglas Elliman agent in Palm Beach. \u201cFor the luxury market, those buildings are in better shape than they\u2019ve been in a decade.\u201d\nWhile Palm Beach\u2019s oceanfront estates and nine-figure residential sales are perhaps better known, the island also has dozens of condominiums, both in town and on the South End, the majority of which are older than 30 years and subject to the new safety laws. With the\nregulations, rising insurance rates and competition\nfrom new development in West Palm Beach, agents said the island\u2019s condo market suffered in the first half of the year.\nBut as activity picks up ahead of the busy winter season, brokers say the sky is clearing for the island\u2019s aging condo supply. The median sale price for condos in Palm Beach has ticked up to $2.7 million, Redfin shows. One hundred sixty-four units are listed for sale, with prices ranging from $315,000 to $17.9 million, according to the listing site. Earlier this month, one Palm Beacher dropped\n$9.4 million\non a unit at Bellaria at 3000 South Ocean Boulevard after selling her home for $30 million.\nCosts for assessments and repairs are averaging between $75 and $100 per square foot, with most of the funds going to cover concrete restoration, Gordon said. That translates to $150,000 to $200,000 for a 2,000-square-foot condo. Brokers declined to comment on assessments of specific buildings.\n\u201cAll these buildings have either completed [assessments and repairs] or have almost completed them,\u201d said Corcoran Group\u2019s Dana Koch.\n\nElsewhere in South Florida, similar assessments are financially devastating for unit owners. Howard Konetz, who lives on a fixed income and owns a unit at Aventura\u2019s Mediterranean Village, told\nFox Business\nhe is facing a $224,000 assessment fee. He wanted to sell, but took the condo off the market after multiple price cuts failed to lure a buyer, Zillow shows.\nMarket insiders say Palm Beach\u2019s condo owners have deeper pockets than most. If a building had a problem, they had the money to throw at it. Now, the worst is behind them, and all of the improvements are a boon for resales, brokers say. Many buildings are in better physical condition and fiscal health than in recent years, thanks to the regulations. Design updates are also helping to close deals, said Elliman\u2019s Chris Leavitt.\n\u201cIt really highlights the buildings that are in perfect condition,\u201d said Leavitt, who pointed to the recently renovated Biltmore at 150 Bradley Place. Leavitt closed two sales in the building over the summer, which he credited in part to the updates.\nPalm Beach\u2019s older condo buildings benefit from immediacy; they are ready to use now, rather than the\nnew developments\nin West Palm Beach that have years-long waits. Buyers are also coming in educated and asking the right questions, agents say.\n\u201cBuyers have just gotten smart. They will ask, \u2018Have you done your milestone inspection? Have you done this? Have you budgeted for it?\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie said.\nPricing is also playing an important role. Sellers are letting go of pandemic-era dreams, Gordon said.\n\u201cPrices are coming down to reflect the reality of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to get a lot of these deals done, the sellers have been much more receptive to paying off special assessments just to move the deals forward.\u201d\nKoch said one of his sellers paid $62,000 to cover assessment fees and move a deal along. Some buildings are adopting \u2018due on sale\u2019 clauses to mandate sellers pay off their share of assessments, including the Cove at 2784 South Ocean Boulevard, Meridian at 3300 South Ocean Boulevard and Halcyon at 3440 South Ocean Boulevard. Gordon said he had a deal in the Meridian, which took out a $10 million loan for its repairs, that involved a $122,000 payment for its \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause.\n\u201cI think every contract that we\u2019ve written lately has a \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause for the special assessment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seller in almost every sale that we\u2019ve done is responsible for the full payment of the assessments.\u201d",

Yimby\nreported\n. The project would\nreplace a one-story office building\nand adjacent parking lot.\nThe proposal calls for Orr to build 330 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments across eight floors above ground. Underground, residents will have access to three levels of subterranean parking accommodating 357 vehicles and additional space for bicycles.\nOf the proposed apartments, 10 percent of them, or 33 units, will be set aside as deed-restricted affordable housing for moderate-income, low-income, and very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, moderate income for one person is\ncategorized\nas making less than $89,550 annually, while low-income is a maximum of $84,850 and very-low-income falls under $53,000 for one person. By including affordable units in the development, the project qualifies for density bonus incentives, allowing the developer additional height and floor area than what zoning limits permit.\nThe ground floor includes floor-to-ceiling windows for resident amenities and lobby space, while units above have recessed balconies. The upper floors step back from the street\u2019s edge to create landscaped terraces and a rooftop green space. In addition to recessed balconies, residents will benefit from passive sustainability touches like solar shading as well as the planned landscaping to improve environmental performances.\n\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the City of Santa Monica is required to build or plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029. Of those, 69 percent must be priced at various affordable-income levels.\nThis summer, the City of Santa Monica put out a call to developers interested in\nbuying plots of city-owned land\nwith plans for affordable housing, with the largest of the three parcels just around the corner from Orr\u2019s proposed construction site.

        "content": "Barbara Corcoran, founder of the eponymous real estate firm and a star investor on the \u201cShark Tank\u201d television series, has cashed out on her New York City penthouse.\nThe 76-year-old entrepreneur listed the condo at 1158 Fifth Avenue in May and\nfound a buyer a day\nafter listing it,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. The closed deal came out to $13.5 million, exceeding her\noriginal asking price by $1.5 million\n, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nCorcoran purchased the historic penthouse at 1158 Fifth Avenue for $10 million in 2015 and invested an additional $2 million in renovations to tailor the home to her taste.\nThe Corcoran Group founder has talked publicly about her longtime personal connection to the residence.\nHer relationship with the Upper East Side penthouse dates to 1992, when she was working as a messenger. One of her deliveries led her to the home, which she has described as captivating,\u00a0 despite being out of her financial reach at the time. She even asked the owner to keep her in mind if the property ever became available. In 2015, after being contacted by the owner, Corcoran purchased the property.\nShe later embarked on a complete overhaul, reconfiguring the upstairs and downstairs spaces, transforming a greenhouse area into an indoor/outdoor dining space, and upgrading the kitchen.\n\nThe enhanced home now has 11 rooms across two floors, with views of Central Park and the city\u2019s skyline.\nAfter nearly a decade as her primary residence, Corcoran decided to sell the penthouse due to her husband, Bill Higgins, struggling with the staircase that connected the two levels. They began searching for a single-story home to suit his mobility needs. Their search included a disappointing miss with an offer for a Fifth Avenue co-op formerly belonging to Hollywood icons\nPaul Newman and Joanne Woodward\n.\nCorcoran has relocated to a single-floor penthouse located nearby in the uptown neighborhood.\nThe real estate heavyweight also this year lost her Pacific Palisades trailer home in the\nCalifornia wildfires\n. She has said she plans to rebuild the home.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Nearly a year after a group of unit owners at a two-tower condo on Brickell Avenue in Miami voted to oust their association president, a judge ordered that the board, including its president, turn over all records and control of the association.\nThat means Jacob Kassel, the board president who led the association\u2019s passage of a $21 million special assessment, the elimination of electronic voting and other\ncontroversial actions\n, is out at\n1060 Brickell\n, a two-tower, 45-story complex with 592 units at 1060 Brickell Avenue.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Joseph Perkins ordered in late September that the board be replaced by Dorinda Spahr, Jermaine Jones and Javier Noriega. The Kassel-led board was also ordered to turn over all records and property of the\nBrickell\nassociation by last Friday, according to the court order. The order is part of the lawsuit the association filed against unit owner James Duddey and others who introduced the recall effort.\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t resolve the litigation involving owners and the\nassociation\n, but it marks a big win for the owners who twice voted to recall their board over the past year. And it reaffirms the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation\u2019s final order, issued in July, that certified one of the recall efforts. That order determined that the current board be removed and that the board turn over all records and association property, including checkbooks, within 10 business days. Spahr, Jones and Noriega were to be appointed to the board effective immediately. But the association appealed.\n\u201cThis case really illustrates some of the issues with the current versions of the recall laws,\u201d Haber Law attorney Jonathan Goldstein told\nThe Real Deal.\nGoldstein and his colleague, Ariella Gutman, represent unit owners Duddey, Spahr and Nu\u00f1ez and other owners.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Marc Halpern, and Kassel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cOur outcome followed nearly a year of intense and costly legal battles against a board that refused to step down,\u201d Spahr, the new president, said. \u201cWe won this case because a committed group of owners united, they financially supported the cause and they were relentless.\u201d\n\nThe new board will remain in place at least until the annual election in November.\nLast November, an official election was not held because the Kassel-led association disqualified the three candidates (Spahr, Jones and Noriega), so the existing board remained in power. Jones and Noriega challenged this via a separate arbitration petition filed with the state, while Spahr and other unit owners sued the association in January, alleging that the November 2024 election was canceled \u201con the incorrect and improper stated basis that there were an insufficient number of candidates to hold an election,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nOwners previously told\nTRD\nthat they had spent more than half a million dollars on attorney fees since last year, in addition to funding the association\u2019s legal fees via their monthly dues. The group of owners said the special assessment, which called for work that included nearly $8 million in fa\u00e7ade restoration and $3.5 million in work to the garage and basement, was unwarranted for a complex that was completed in 2008 \u2014 17 years ago.\nIn a separate lawsuit, Jessica Bergman and Antonio Sevillano, a married couple, sued the condo association in December. Their complaint, seeking a class action, amended in January, alleged that the board\u2019s passage of the special assessment violated Florida law by failing to provide a description of the special assessment and by failing to allow unit owners to vote on it. Bergman and Sevillano alleged that the board\u2019s 2-1 vote on the assessment also violated the property\u2019s condo declaration.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Halpern, told\nTRD\nthis summer that it is the board\u2019s fiduciary duty to maintain the property and make necessary repairs, and Kassel said that his priority was ensuring the property is safe.\nJudge Perkins\u2019 latest order was the result of a Sept. 26 hearing. Perkins found that Duddey had demonstrated a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d on the recall effort.\nPerkins wrote that the court found the association\u2019s violations of the Florida Condominium Act resulted in \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d His granting of a temporary injunction, he wrote, \u201cwill serve the public interest.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Investors in homebuilder stocks responded to comments from President Donald Trump and\nfederal housing head Bill Pulte\nwith a selloff that set off a four-day losing streak.\nThe sector\u2019s S&amp;P index saw a downturn of nearly 9 percent this week, marking the worst performance for homebuilders since Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nHomebuilders have faced mounting challenges this year, from\nrising inventory levels\nto new tariffs on imports of timber, lumber and other wood goods essential to home construction. The administration has further intensified the situation by blaming builders for the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\nThe situation worsened after Trump\u2019s post on social media, which criticized homebuilders for having millions of empty lots and urged them to begin constructing homes.\nPulte, grandson of\nPulteGroup\u2019s founder William J. Pulte\n, echoed the sentiment, claiming major homebuilders now control 50 percent to 60 percent of the market and bear the bulk of the responsibility to contribute to housing supply.\nPulte also said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require disclosures for \u201cBig Builder\u201d loans, potentially increasing scrutiny on their practices.\n\nUrging builders to construct more homes could further harm the industry, given the existing unsold inventory and declining margins, Renaissance Macro Research economics head Neil Dutta told the outlet. He described Pulte\u2019s comments as \u201cbullying\u201d builders.\nThe hardest-hit stocks in the sector this year include LGI Homes, Champion Homes and Century Communities, each down more than 20 percent, while Lennar has dropped more than 8 percent. PulteGroup, on the other hand, has seen a 17 percent increase in its stock price.\nThe sector has seen a 19 percent decline in the last 12 months, a significant underperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 16 percent rally.\nMarket analysts have pointed out the underlying issues for builders, such as rising margin pressures due to increasing inventory, which has led to price reductions in critical markets. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, new-home supply is at its highest level since 2007.\nRising tariffs on softwood lumber and kitchen cabinets could increase the cost of a new home by more than $10,000, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Drew Reading warned last month, while the\noverall sentiment of homebuyers remains depressed\n.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Officials have put a face to the start of the deadly Palisades Fire.\nJonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old former Uber driver living in Florida, has been arrested and charged with federal arson for allegedly setting a fire in January that became the Palisades blaze, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nRinderknecht, who reportedly lived in the L.A. area before moving to Florida this year, allegedly dropped off a passenger in the\nPacific Palisades\nnear where a fire was later discovered to have started just after midnight on Jan. 1. The 29-year-old purportedly walked up a hiking trail, took videos on his phone and listened to a rap song, \u201cUn Zder, Un The\u201d by French artist Josman, with a music video showing \u201cobjects being lit on fire,\u201d Bill Essayli, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, said,\naccording\nto\nBloomberg and ABC News.\nEnvironmental sensors detected the beginnings of a fire in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, and Rinderknecht himself called 911 to report the fire. He allegedly fled the scene but returned after seeing fire trucks driving back up to where it started.\n\u201cThe fire continued to smolder and burn underground within the root structure of the dense vegetation,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cSo that fire started on Jan. 1, and it smoldered underground for about a week until on Jan. 7. Heavy winds caused this underground fire to surface and spread above ground, causing what became known as the Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive\nwildfires\nin Los Angeles city history.\u201d\nWhen federal authorities seized Rinderknecht\u2019s digital devices, they found an AI-generated image from Chat GPT depicting a burning city. The accused arsonist moved to Florida \u201cbecause he was aware that people might be looking for him,\u201d Essayli said.\nInvestigators spent months tracking down the fire\u2019s origins and even re-staged the blaze in an attempt to learn more about how it started. Kenny Cooper, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the San Francisco Field Division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Rinderknecht bears sole responsibility for the kindling of the fire.\n\n\u201cThat fire burned deep within the ground, in roots and in structure, and remained active for several days,\u201d Cooper said,\nper\nthe L.A. Times. \u201cNo matter how good they are, they can\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\nThose who dealt with Rinderknecht knew him to be a relatively reserved person. \u201dHe kept to himself,\u201d one anonymous neighbor told the Times.\nAnother former neighbor, 39-year-old Peter Chang of\nHollywood\n, was shocked to learn Rinderknecht was accused of lighting the fire. \u201cHe was actually a really nice guy,\u201d Chang said.\nA former roommate who lived with Rinderknecht in the Palisades didn\u2019t believe the suspect would do such a thing. \u201cI can only tell you the Jonathan I know would never do anything like that,\u201d the anonymous roommate told the Times. He noted that Rinderknecht would sometimes \u201cjust start talking fast and get bratty with people who confronted him. But he wouldn\u2019t get violent; he would maybe just smoke some pot and go to sleep.\u201d\nRinderknecht\u2019s preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 17.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "At a time when many downtown office tenants are downsizing, one logistics player is making the most of Chicago\u2019s centrality and doing the opposite.\nAustin, Texas-based Arrive Logistics, a major freight brokerage connecting shippers with trucking carriers, signed a lease for 77,700 square feet across three floors at 30 South Wacker Drive, expanding its space by 21,000 square feet, according to property owner Tishman Speyer and first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Located at the\nCME Center\nin the West Loop, the firm plans on bringing 100 new jobs to Chicago next year.\nThe deal extended Arrive\u2019s commitment to the two-tower complex through 2037. It\u2019s the third expansion for Arrive since the firm set up shop there a decade ago. Terry Herlihy of NAI Hiffman represented Arrive in the deal. Ellen May and Isabella Rapken negotiated for\nthe landlord\n.\nThe move bucks the broader trend of contraction across the Loop, where downtown office users have collectively shed more than 2 million square feet over the past two years, according to CBRE.\nMany firms are rethinking their office space needs amid hybrid work patterns, leaving landlords scrambling to fill gaps.\n\nBut transportation logistics firms \u2014 long anchored in Chicago \u2014 have proved an exception. Companies such as MoLo Solutions, Loadsmart and Total Quality Logistics have all grown their downtown presence since 2020, riding a post-pandemic surge in e-commerce and supply chain demand.\nArrive has about 470 employees in\u00a0 its Chicago office, and its headcount is expected to top 570 next year. The company\u2019s fast growth \u2014 projected to lift this year\u2019s revenue 35 percent year-over-year to $2.5 billion \u2014 drove the need for more space. The firm also touted Chicago\u2019s talent pool.\nArrive\u2019s employees are largely in the office full-time, and the lease will consolidate its offices within CME Center in a contiguous space. The buildout will be phased through next year, with completion slated for October.\nNew York-based\nTishman Speyer\nrecently modernized the CME Center lobby and retained other key tenants \u2014 including\nBP\n, which earlier this year renewed its 240,000-square-foot lease through 2032. The 2.3 million-square-foot complex is about 85 percent leased, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

When the Priztkers pushed for\u00a0 and the Pritzkers wanted an expensive upgrade to the property.\nTrump saw the demand, which required more cash from each owner, as an attempt to take advantage of him at his weakest moment, as his three casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were in Chapter 11 at the time, according to a\nWall Street Journal story published in 2016\n.\nTrump sued the Pritzkers, accusing them of civil racketeering to force him out of the deal, an allegation they denied.\n\u201cI called Jay [Pritzker] and said, \u2018You\u2019re a bad guy, Jay. I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u2019\u201d Trump told the Journal in 2016.\n\nTrump later settled the suit and the Pritzkers\u2019 Hyatt Corporation bought his half of the property for $140 million. Jay Pritzker, JB\u2019s uncle and Trump\u2019s main antagonist in the drama, died in 1999.\nMore recently, the Illinois governor has clashed with the president over Trump\u2019s claims of crime and immigration issues in the Windy City.\nTensions reached a fever pitch last week after federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security\nraided a building on Chicago\u2019s South Shore\n, resulting in the arrests of 37 people and outcry from local officials over the atypical detainment of tenants, including children, during the operation.\nThe raid raised questions about\nlandlord and tenants\u2019 rights in the city\namid an escalation in federal scrutiny,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nTrump this week deployed 300 Illinois National Guard members and 200 Texas troops to Chicago. Pritzker condemned the move as unconstitutional, and the state filed a lawsuit seeking a restraining order. Trump responded to Pritzker\u2019s rebukes of immigration agents on the ground by saying he, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, \u201cshould be in jail.\u201d\nThe governor isn\u2019t the only Pritzker family member still engaging in the long-running clash with Trump.\nJB\u2019s sister Penny, who served as finance chair for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, has engaged in recent months\nin a separate battle with the Trump administration\nover antisemitism claims at Harvard University, where she now serves as a senior fellow on its governing board.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

It\u2019s expected to be listed for $13.5 million, or $2,113 per square foot.\nCompass\u2019 Josh Flagg has the listing.\nRecords show Hawn and Russell bought the property in 2004 for $4.1 million and held it for over a decade, before selling it in 2017 for $6.9 million. The seller is a trust tied to Champion Real Estate Company founders Robert and Marjorie Champion, according to property records.\nThe Santa Monica-based real estate firm began in 1987 and focuses on multifamily, retail, office, mixed-use and adaptive reuse projects. It has invested more than $2 billion into properties since the firm was founded, according to its website.\nThe Champions invested in the Capri Drive home and renovated it before placing the traditional-designed property on the market.\n\nSeveral features of the home lend to entertaining, including a bedroom conversion to a temperature-controlled wine tasting room, a pool, fire pits, barbecue area, outdoor dining and putting green. Other highlights include four fireplaces, a den with its own skylight and primary suite touting a custom walk-in closet and a connected bonus room.\nFlagg said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\nPalisades\nis seeing \u201crenewed momentum.\u201d\n\u201cWith many lots being sold in the aftermath of the fires, there are few move-in ready homes available, and this street remains one of the rare areas untouched,\u201d Flagg said.\nRodeo Realty\u2019s Jimmy Heckenberg and The Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana currently hold the Palisades\u2019 highest-priced listing, located at 766 Paseo Miramar. The 18,000-square-foot, new-build went on the market in June for $54 million and was relisted in August for $39 million, or $2,123 per square foot.\nThis year\u2019s priciest known residential sale in the Palisades was\n1124 Napoli Drive\n, which closed off market in late August for $25.8 million, or $2,437 per square foot. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Zac Mostame represented the seller and buyer.\n",

In May, Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure complaint against the Bridge Investment entities that owned the 24.4-acre assemblage, alleging default on a $59.2 million mortgage.\nAs part of its purchase for all three buildings, Hamilton assumed the mortgage, records show.\nHamilton plans to tear down the buildings at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue and at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, and replace them with two industrial facilities spanning more than 300,000 square feet, a press release states. The office building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain as part of the new development that will be called Flagler Logistics Center.\nHamilton plans to break ground on the warehouses next year and expects to complete the project in 2027, the release states.\nThe firm is also planning an office-to-industrial conversion in\nKendall\n, a suburban unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade.

The\nbuilding\n, which spans 735,000 square feet, is just 47 percent leased, according to the listing. The starting bid amounts to $13.60 per square foot.\nSeller\nCW Capital\ntook over the 36-story asset from Fortis Property Group after a winning foreclosure-auction bid of $80 million in 2021. Fortis bought the property in 2006 and spent $10 million on renovations in 2011, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe building\u2019s appraisal took a 20 percent haircut back in February, when it was valued at $51.2 million \u2014 just 41 percent of its 2014 valuation of $124 million, according to Morningstar. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $45.4 million.\nMajor tenants include engineering giant Jacobs, which has its global headquarters there, along with Omnicom Management and the General Services Administration.\nBuilt in the early 1980s, the tower is zoned for mixed-use, and redevelopment could include residential or hotel conversions. The property sits near the St. Paul DART station and the M-Line trolley, with more than 1,300 parking spaces.\n\nTranswestern\u2019s Mike Hardage, Stephen Simon and Steve Pumper are marketing the property.\nA 0.16-acre slice beneath the\nHarwood\nCenter is also for sale, listed by\nColliers\n. The listing offers ownership of a ground lease set to expire in 2077. The land takes in an annual rent payment of $65,232 according to the listing.\nDallas\u2019 Central Business District has one of the highest vacancy rates in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Buildings from the 1980s are faring worse as tenants demand newer offices with top-tier amenities and attractive locations.\nUptown\nattracts major tenants and new development \u2014 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the region\u2019s 2.7 million-square-foot pipeline \u2014 while downtown\u2019s aging stock has struggled.\nFor prospective buyers, that reality could cut both ways: Harwood Center\u2019s half-empty floors may look like a liability now, but for the right investor, they could be the blank canvas for downtown\u2019s next big conversion.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, the board claims, he used it for unrelated real estate ventures through JDS.\nStern had agreed he would fix the defects before abandoning the project and leaving the board and unit owners to repair and replace issues in the building and completing proposed amenities, according to the complaint.\nStern served as president of the condo board from 2020 until February 2025, during which time the building\u2019s sponsors, through Stern, controlled the board, according to the complaint.\nThe board is seeking at least $5 million in damages.\n\nThe complaint lists a litany of alleged issues, including cellar drains that \u201crepresent the inverse of proper installation,\u201d leaking sinks and floors in units and dryers that \u201croutinely malfunction.\u201d\nThe board claimed that it hired architects to inspect the building\u2019s alleged defects every year starting in 2022, and that as of Aug. 2024, it was estimated to cost at least $4 million to cure defects in the common areas.\nStern and Largo Investments did not respond to requests for comment.\nGrowing pains\nThe 14-unit building, which was declared condo-effective in 2019, closed its first sale in 2020. It had a projected sellout of over $160 million, including non-residential units.\nThe lawsuit is not the first related to the work done at the site, which Stern and Brooklyn-based Largo Investments\npurchased for almost $35 million in 2014\n.\nIn 2020, Stern\nsued his equity partners\n, Largo co-founders Nicholas Werner and Nissim Ben-Nun, accusing them of misrepresenting their development experience, which the pair denied. A judge ruled in Werner and Ben-Nun\u2019s favor in 2023.\nStern has also weathered a flurry of lawsuits at his Billionaire\u2019s Row tower at 111 West 57th Street, which has seen a turnaround in formerly sluggish sales this year to the point where the building is now over 90 percent sold as of the end of September.\nStern, who primarily lives in Miami, has otherwise\nturned his professional sights to the Sunshine State\n, where JDS is behind high-profile projects,\nincluding branded condos\nbearing the names of\nDolce &amp; Gabbana\nand\nMercedes-Benz\n.\n",

The buyer is a land trust named after the address.\nThe home was completed last year by developer\nTodd Michael Glaser\n, according to the listing. The 0.3-acre property features 170 feet of water frontage, a pool and spa. It hit the market last year for $32.5 million, and was most recently asking $29.5 million with listing agent\nNelson Gonzalez\nof Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s Eloy Carmenate and Mick Duchon represented the buyer.\n\nThe property previously traded for $9.5 million in 2021, records show. The new house has a chef\u2019s kitchen, master suite with a night bar, a wellness suite and a three-car garage. It\u2019s on Sunset Island III.\nThe selling entity is managed by Randall Smith and Heath Freeman, the multimillionaire co-founders of West Palm Beach-based Alden Global. It\u2019s one of a handful of properties tied to Smith and his wife, Barbara Stovall Smith, in Miami Beach.\nIn 2022, the Smiths were linked to the sale of the waterfront mansion at 34 Star Island Drive to LoanDepot\u2019s billionaire founder, Anthony Hsieh,\nfor $30 million\n. The previous year, they sold\u00a0 three homes in Palm Beach for $56 million.\nCompanies managed by the same attorney the Smiths used for the Star Island house and the Sunset Islands house also purchased the waterfront home at 4774 North Bay Road in 2021, had the house demolished and hired Glaser to build a new home. They sold the house in May of this year\nfor $29.5 million\n.\nThe Alden Global LLC\u2019s sale marks the latest pricey Sunset Islands deal.\nIn September, waste management mogul Patrick Dovigi\npaid $15 million\nto acquire a waterfront house on the Sunset Islands in an off-market deal. It\u2019s next door to the 11,300-square-foot waterfront mansion he bought for\n$27.5 million\nin April. Between the two properties, his estate now spans 1.2 acres.\nThis summer, ex-Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam sold a waterfront home for\n$21.5 million\n, and disgraced luxury broker Oren Alexander sold his waterfront mansion for\n$51.5 million\n.\n",

        "content": "FlightWave Aerospace Systems is taking flight with its latest lease in the Los Angeles area.\nThe subsidiary of drone technology company Red Cat Holdings, signed a five-year lease for 51,023 square feet of space at a creative industrial and office property in Torrance, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal is purportedly valued at almost $5.4 million. The facility at 2660 Columbia Street is owned by Chicago-based\nFirst Industrial Realty Trust\n.\nWith the new lease, FlightWave will more than triple its office footprint. The company currently operates out of a 14,616-square-foot space at Carson Industrial Center in Carson. FlightWave signed a three-year lease agreement at the DWS Group-owned property in late March, though it quickly outgrew the space. The company plans to sublease its Carson offices after setting up shop in Torrance.\nOf the 51,023 square feet of industrial space at the new Torrance facility, 12,079 square feet are refurbished offices. The property has a clear height of 20 feet with four dock-high positions, an early suppression-fast response sprinkler system and 75 on-site parking spaces.\n\nFlightWave\u2019s new home is in a fitting location, as the aerospace industry has deep roots in the South Bay dating back to the World War II era. It still remains popular for aerospace companies today; the\nBill Gates\n-backed Heart Aerospace, for example, signed a lease for 30,000 square feet at 1830 West 205th Street in Torrance last month. And in March, aerospace and aviation industry manufacturer\nTrio Manufacturing tripled its footprint\nto more than 123,000 square feet at a facility in Gardena.\nIn Torrance, besides Heart Aerospace, FlightWave will join Honeywell Aerospace at 2525 West 190th Street, Cadence Aerospace at 22906 Frampton Avenue, and In Orbit Aerospace at 20600 Gramercy Place. Several companies are also clustered around Zamperini Field, formerly known as the Torrance Municipal Airport, including Howmet Aerospace, Lisi Aerospace and Microcosm.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

I think we\u2019re just used to complex deals that are very dynamic, and with complex characters as well.\u201d\nWitkoff and Kushner spent the recent critical days of talks in in-person meetings, arriving in Egypt on Tuesday to meet a group of mediators who had already been working there for days to convince Hamas to disarm and to return Israeli hostages who were taken in October 2023. The duo reportedly spent the flight discussing ways the deal could collapse and what they could do to save it in such a case, with Witkoff doing direct negotiating over the phone while Kushner would draft up plans.\n\u201cThe experience that Steve and\u2004I have as\u2004deal\u2004guys is that\u2004you have to understand people,\u201d Kushner added. \u201cYou have to be able to kind of\u2004get the bottom line\u2004out of them, and then\u2004see who\u2004do you think is\u2004playing games, and how much\u2004room\u2004do you have to push things?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the people who do this are history professors, because they have a lot of experience, or diplomats,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just different being deal guys \u2014 just a different sport.\u201d\n\nKushner and Witkoff\u2019s roles in the discussions have drawn criticism from some who view their role as being personally rather than politically driven.\nAlong with their personal ties to Trump are potentially huge business gains.\nAffinity Partners,\nKushner\u2019s private equity firm, has raised billions\nfrom wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cIn order for the next stage of this agreement to be successful, Jared Kushner needs to stop approaching this issue as a real estate deal and start focusing on political and human rights,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.\nThe deal marks the second ceasefire agreement in the region signed this year, the first being in January shortly before Trump took office. Israel reportedly violated that agreement more than 1,000 times, leading to the collapse of that ceasefire in March, according to a\nletter\nsent to the United Nations from Riyad Mansour, the State of Palestine\u2019s Permanent Observer in the body. In the hours since the new agreement was announced, Israel has\nreportedly\nnot ceased its bombing campaign.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Its ownership venture \u2014 Rubenstein Partners of Philadelphia and Chicago-based Glenstar \u2014 was sued in 2023 over an alleged default on an $85 million loan tied to the property.\nThe debt, now controlled by Miami-based special servicer Rialto Capital on behalf of CMBS investors, has since been a test case for suburban office workouts.\nRialto\u2019s deal with\nVerizon\nhelps steady cash flow for the complex, which was only 53 percent leased as of July, well below the suburban average of about 68 percent, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cThis extension is a good indication that a Class A property with stellar amenities and convenient access can draw and retain high-quality tenants,\u201d said Transwestern\u2019s Joe Stevens, who represented ownership in the transaction. Stevens and Steve Degodny handle leasing for the building.\nContinental Towers has faced a turbulent stretch in recent years.\nWhen Rubenstein and Glenstar paid $122 million for it in 2018, the property was nearly 90 percent leased. Soon after, major tenants including Komatsu and Panasonic exited more than 150,000 square feet combined, and the pandemic slowed backfilling efforts.\nOwnership has since poured $28.5 million into upgrades, from lobby renovations to tenant amenities.\nVerizon\n, which has anchored the complex since 2016, is its largest tenant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s $2,364 for the 11,000-square-foot home. The manse was originally listed in 2023 for $32 million.\nThe asking price is more than eight times what Willenborg and his wife, Barbara, paid for the home nearly four decades ago. The couple purchased the property in 1988 for $3.4 million; the house has undergone extensive renovations since then.\nIf the sale closes, it would be one of the\nbiggest luxury purchases in San Francisco\nthis year.\nThe top spot goes to an 8,300-square-foot property at 260 Sea Cliff Avenue which sold off-market in January for $30 million. In March, the Jewett House at 2990 Broadway, a block away from Willenborg\u2019s home, sold for $26.5 million. The onetime\nSan Francisco Decorator Showcase home\nat 3701 Washington Street also sold off-market for $26 million.\n\nThe home at 2898 Broadway was completed in 1899 and designed by architect Walter D. Bliss, who went on to design landmarks like the St. Francis Hotel, Oakland Hotel, California State Building, the James Flood Mansion, Southern Pacific Building and the Geary Theatre.\nIt gained recognition on screen,\nappearing in movies\nlike 1960\u2019s \u201cPortrait in Black\u201d with Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn and 1985\u2019s \u201cJagged Edge\u201d with Jeff Bridges and Glenn Close.

The property is owned by an affiliate of China-based Z&L; that entity filed for bankruptcy in July to stave off the foreclosure seizure.\nOn Oct. 2, a federal judge cleared the way to proceed by issuing an order that would effectively terminate the bankruptcy case and allow the lender to proceed with the foreclosure and seizure. That same day, the Z&amp;L affiliate filed a lawsuit to block the foreclosure, alleging wrongful foreclosure and unfair business practices among other claims.\nThe suit claims that about a year ago, the lender proposed a way for the Z&amp;L affiliate to reorganize financing for the property, albeit primarily via a loan with a 10 percent interest rate, higher than the 8 percent rate on the delinquent loan.\n\u201cThe October 2024 renewal was not a real workout,\u201d the Z&amp;L affiliate said in a court filing. \u201cIt was a foreclosure trap.\u201d\nThe Z&amp;L affiliate is already approved to develop about 700 housing units on the former Greyhound station site, though the developer never broke ground on the project. Because so much time has passed, the permits for the site have expired, so a developer would have to start the planning process over from square one.\n\nStill, both the Z&amp;L affiliate and the lending group haven\u2019t given up hope on building, as they\u2019ve both stated in court filings that they have new plans to develop housing at the site.\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a series of real estate scandals in San Jose tied to Z&amp;L Properties and its affiliates.\nA Z&amp;L-owned historic church at 43 East Saint James Street in downtown San Jose, for example, has drawn complaints for its dilapidated state. In June, Machine Investment Group bought a two-tower residential complex at 188 West Saint James Street in a foreclosure proceeding that took ownership of the property from a Z&amp;L affiliate.\nNearly all of Z&amp;L\u2019s real estate empire in San Jose\nhas fallen apart\nthrough deeply discounted property sales or foreclosure proceedings, and the Greyhound station appears to be part of its last stand.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The legal fallout from DJE Texas Management Group\u2019s collapse keeps widening.\nDenver-based Platte Canyon Capital filed a new lawsuit against the multifamily syndicator\u2019s former chief, Devin Elder, accusing him of fraud and breach of contract tied to the July sale of a San Antonio apartment complex, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nPlatte\u2019s suit seeks more than $1 million in damages and accuses Elder of effectively stealing $52,000 in rent from the property after the sale, records from Bexar County\u2019s 37th Civil District Court show. The complaint centers on the 268-unit\nAllure Apartments\nat 7770 Pipers Lane, one of several DJE assets unloaded this summer amid the firm\u2019s unraveling. Platte claims Elder and his affiliates, including\nDJE Properties\nand 7770 Pipers LLC, misrepresented the building\u2019s occupancy rate and financial health leading up to the sale.\nDJE allegedly told Platte the complex was more than 90 percent leased, with tenants lined up to fill remaining vacancies, according to the Oct. 6 petition. But once Platte took over, it found that numerous tenants were delinquent or had stopped paying rent altogether \u2014 and that DJE hadn\u2019t filed any evictions or taken steps to address the arrears, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe actual occupancy rate, Platte contends, was about 15 percent lower than DJE represented.\nOn top of that, the lawsuit accuses DJE of continuing to collect rent for two months after closing, taking in more than $52,000 through its online payment portal in violation of the sales agreement. Elder has not returned the money, Platte alleges.\n\n\u201cElder\u2019s communications convey not refusal, but inability, to return what is in effect stolen rent,\u201d Platte\u2019s attorney David Denton wrote. \u201cPlatte construes the inability to pay to mean that the money is already disbursed and gone \u2014 especially given the backdrop of lawsuits, investigations and investor demands.\u201d\nThe sale was financed with an $18.2 million loan from Prime Finance Partners, though the full transaction terms weren\u2019t disclosed. Platte and its attorney declined to comment. Elder, his counsel and broker Newmark did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet.\nElder and DJE\u2019s pile of legal and regulatory troubles has grown since February, when communications to investors abruptly stopped. Multiple investor lawsuits are pending, and the FBI is investigating DJE for alleged money laundering and wire fraud.\nIn August, federal investigators opened a\ncriminal probe\ninto Elder\u2019s DJE Texas Management Group, following a June warrant to seize DJE properties, including over 1,000 acres of land tied to Elder\u2019s\nDJE portfolio across six counties\nin South Texas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani has been criticized for fantastical proposals, including free day care, free buses, a $70 billion bond issue, a $30-an-hour minimum wage and 200,000 union-built homes built for $500,000 apiece.\nCampaign platforms might be irresponsible or even dishonest, but \u201cwhatever works\u201d has become an accepted strategy \u2014 one that seems to have helped Mamdani, who leads his main competition in the mayoral election, Andrew Cuomo, by 13 points in the latest poll (more on that below).\nCuomo seems to have gotten the message. At a\nCrain\u2019s mayoral forum\non Wednesday, the former governor said: \u201cThe big project has to be 500,000 units of affordable housing on 300 sites\nsimultaneously\n. I think that\u2019s the first big project.\u201d\nThat makes Mamdani\u2019s pie-in-the-sky ideas seem mundane.\nCuomo\u2019s\ninitial housing plan\nwas to build or preserve 500,000 units over 10 years. Now he\u2019s saying build (forget preserving) 500,000 all at once. And not just any units \u2014 affordable ones. Those require subsidies.\nThe number of 1,000-unit projects being built in the city at any given time is in the single digits. To say we should attack the housing crisis by building 300 of them at once is like saying\nDaenerys Targaryen\nshould have conquered the Seven Kingdoms by hatching 300 dragons instead of three. (Yes, I miss \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d)\nEven if Cuomo could find 300 sites for projects averaging 1,667 affordable units, and the money to finance them, I don\u2019t think there would be enough tower cranes to build them. Or tower crane operators, for that matter.\nGetting licensed as a tower crane operator in the city typically requires getting into the International Union of Operating Engineers\u2019 training program. As mayor, Mike Bloomberg tried to break the\nunion\u2019s stranglehold\non the process, a fight that Bill de Blasio\ncontinued\n. (For this and other reasons, tower crane operators are in high demand and can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.)\nI cannot think of a single element of Cuomo\u2019s statement that is even remotely feasible. The least absurd one would be finding 300 sites for big developments. But that would require buying or condemning (by eminent domain) a lot of private property, which alone would take years. This is so not happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOffice sublet queen Ruth Colp-Haber wrote in her entertaining newsletter that 1,000-unit projects \u201chere and there\u201d are nice but not enough to meet demand, so the next mayor should launch a competition for architects and developers to pitch \u201cvisionary new projects and even new neighborhoods.\u201d\nBig housing ideas have been floated: Comptroller Brad Lander suggested developing on four city golf courses. Mike Bloomberg called for dredging the harbor and using fill to extend the Lower East Side into the water. Bill de Blasio wanted to deck over Sunnyside Yard. Mayor Eric Adams swapped land to the Port Authority to do a $3.5 billion\nBrooklyn Marine Terminal development\nthat promises 6,000 homes.\nWhat\u2019s your big housing idea?

That flexibility is good: New York City has many childless adults and couples doing the roommate thing because small units are in short supply.\nAlso, office conversions create tricky layouts not conducive to multiple bedrooms. Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger\u2019s conversion of\n29 West 35th Street\nwill be all studios, and\n5 Times Square\nby RXR, SL Green and Apollo will be 1,050 studios and 200 one-bedrooms.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA\nQuinnipiac poll\nreleased Thursday \u2014 Quinnipiac\u2019s first since a Sept. 10 poll in which Adams was at 12 percent \u2014 found Cuomo\u2019s support grew by 10 points and Mamdani\u2019s by 1 point. This suggests that nearly all Adams voters moved to Cuomo, who still trails Mamdani 46 percent to 33 percent.\nThe poll also found 48 percent of likely voters felt Mamdani would do the best job of lowering housing costs, and 25 percent said Cuomo would. That was the only issue on which Mamdani bested his top-line 46 percent number. He did worse on managing the schools (41 percent), public safety (35 percent) and growing the economy (35 percent).\nQuinnipiac also asked likely voters which candidate\u2019s views were closest to their own on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Forty-one percent said Mamdani and 26 percent said Cuomo. That might come as a shock to members of the real estate industry who consider Mamdani\u2019s position on Israel to be disqualifying.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$8.4 million\nfor a 3,162-square-foot condominium unit at 104 Wooster Street in Soho. Danny Davis, Lisa Balbuena and Lisa Davis of the Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$25 million\nfor a 71,180-square-foot office building. Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger\nplan to convert\nthe property to 107 studio apartments.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$42 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot co-op at 55 Central Park West. The Nickman O\u2019Neal Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Jeff Krasnoff\u2019s securitized debt heavyweight\nRialto Capital\nsnagged control of a distressed\nRosemont\noffice property, helping to wrap up one of the Chicago area\u2019s most severe suburban office meltdowns.\nThe Miami-based special servicer for mortgage debt tied to the nine-story\nColumbia Center III property\nat 9525 West Bryn Mawr Avenue took over the building from Adventus Realty Trust in late September through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, resolving a yearslong lawsuit over a $29 million loan default, public records show.\nThe transfer marks the latest twist in a downward spiral for Adventus, the once-aggressive Canadian investor whose U.S. office portfolio has been in freefall since its 2023 bankruptcy. Adventus leadership didn\u2019t return a request for comment, and Rialto declined to comment.\nRialto\u2019s takeover also highlights how deeply the property\u2019s distress had begun to weigh on the lender\u2019s own books. Columbia Center III \u2014 which is in a three-building complex spanning 620,000 square feet \u2014 produced just $4.7 million in revenue last year while expenses topped $5 million, including $1.7 million in debt service, according to loan data.\nEarlier this year, the property was appraised at just $11.7 million, loan data shows, down bigtime from $41 million back in 2014, when its $29 million loan was originated by JP Morgan and then packaged up with other commercial property debts and sold off to investors.\nThe imbalance mirrored the broader dysfunction inside Adventus\u2019 debt web. A letter filed Sept. 26 in New York U.S. District Court sheds light on the messy unwinding.\n\nThat lawsuit regards a separate\n$350 million CMBS debt pool\nwith an adjustable interest rate that\u2019s tied to Adventus-owned office properties that have drawn loan defaults, including the other two Columbia Center buildings and more in Illinois and Georgia. Attorneys for the bondholders of the property loans in that case told Judge Margaret Garnett that the parties had reached a \u201csettlement in principle\u201d covering multiple distressed assets \u2014 but that the \u201ccomplex deed-in-lieu agreements\u201d and receivership logistics had slowed final execution.\nFive of Adventus\u2019 Georgia properties had already been seized via nonjudicial foreclosures, the letter said, while deed-in-lieu transfers for three more \u2014 including the Columbia Centre I and II offices in Rosemont as well The Crossings in suburban Chicago\u2019s Oak Brook and Cantera Meadows in Warrenville \u2014 were \u201csubstantially final.\u201d\nDuring the origination of the $350 million loan a little more than four years ago, the properties used as collateral included five in the Atlanta area and three in the Chicago area, with the two Columbia Center buildings, Cantera Meadows and The Crossings also getting wrapped into the deal. The buildings were appraised at $439 million at the time, but were valued at $47.8 million in November, according to loan data.\nThe court document confirms that Adventus\u2019 unraveling extended far beyond Chicago. Its multi-state office portfolio, once touted as a stable income play, instead triggered litigation in multiple jurisdictions.\nNow Rialto must decide whether to hold, sell or reposition the Rosemont asset it just seized. While Rosemont remains one of the better-performing suburban submarkets, even its Class A towers face tough math. As hybrid work and higher interest rates reshape office demand, Rialto\u2019s newest acquisition may prove less a trophy than a test of timing.\n",

It\u2019s been cited as a significant hurdle in the Palisades, a community within the city of Los Angeles, with many agents saying the assessment has stopped deals from happening.\nBass, in a\nletter\nto members of the 15-seat City Council sent on Thursday, requested they pass an ordinance that would give the finance director the authority to enact the limited ULA pause.\nThe move came after Bass met with developer Rick Caruso in his capacity as founder of the nonprofit Steadfast LA, which he established to aid in the rebuilding of the Palisades and Altadena after both areas were hit by wildfires earlier this year.\nThe stirrings of action brought some early cheers from the residential marketplace.\n\u201cPausing the ULA mansion tax is a game changer for Pacific Palisades,\u201d Amalfi Estates founder\nAnthony Marguleas\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nThursday evening. \u201cFamilies rebuilding after the fire need relief, not more financial hurdles.\nMarguleas said the move would \u201chelp unlock much needed inventory for our community.\u201d\nBass proposed the one-time exemption on residential properties only, which would mean single-family homes, condominiums and what she described in her letter to the council as \u201cother residential housing\u201d impacted by the fires.\n\nSuch a move would \u201cspeed up sales of these properties and spur rebuilding and rehabilitation of the Palisades,\u201d Bass said in her letter. \u201cThis will create more housing citywide and generate higher Measure ULA tax revenue when these rebuilt or renovated properties are subsequently sold to new homeowners because those second and subsequent sales will remain subject to Measure ULA.\u201d\nAs it currently exists, Measure ULA \u201cis silent on an issue now affecting our Palisades community,\u201d Bass said of the tax\u2019s cost implications for those trying to recover from the fire.\nIt\u2019s unclear if any moves have been made to place discussion of the ordinance on a future city council meeting agenda. An inquiry to Bass\u2019 office was not immediately returned Thursday evening.\nFirst crack\nWhile Bass\u2019 proposal is temporary, if passed, it would be the first crack in an armor that\u2019s shielded ULA from exemptions or other changes since the ballot measure was passed and went into effect in 2023.\nLawsuits and a new ballot measure to have the tax repealed have routinely drawn the ire of housing and homeless advocates whose vocal responses have so far helped create a fortress around adjustments to the tax.\nBass\u2019 proposal hits at a criticism some have had for the tax in its unilateral application to real estate transactions \u2014 both commercial and residential \u2014 without taking into account realities such as if a home sells at a loss or what happens in the case of a natural disaster.\nBeyond residential, the tax has affected commercial transactions and land deals as it\u2019s viewed as another layer of cost making it harder to get deals to pencil out.\n\u201cThere are no parameters and no boundaries on the measure,\u201d Beverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO\nRayni Williams\ntold\nTRD\nlast month in discussing the tax. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that [addresses] if you\u2019re taking a loss on a sale or if it\u2019s an inherited property. At least capital gains [tax] has parameters.\u201d\n",

        "content": "More single-family homes in Sawtelle are slated to be replaced with multifamily residential properties.\nTerra Capital filed an application to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning to build a new eight-story building at 2219 South Wellesley Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The property sits a few blocks southwest of the Expo/Bundy Metro station, and as a result, would benefit from\nTransit Oriented Development\nincentives.\nThe project proposal calls for the construction of 42 studio, one- and three-bedroom apartments and parking for five vehicles on the site. To help make it happen, the developer is requesting entitlements including Transit Oriented Incentive Area development bonuses, which would allow the developer to build a larger structure than zoning rules would otherwise allow.\nIn exchange for the larger-sized development, nine of the apartments are to be set aside as affordable housing for low-income residents. The \u201clow-income\u201d in Los Angeles County is currently\nset\nat an annual income of $84,850 or less for one person.\nKevin Tsai Architecture is designing the building. When complete, it will feature a rooftop deck and a backyard for residents to use.\n\nThe project site is adjacent to the location of another Terra Capital project also designed by Kevin Tsai Architecture. The two firms are planning to build a fully affordable housing project at 2215 South Wellesley Avenue, a planned seven-story building with 82 studio, one-, and three-bedroom apartments. The companies are also planning a 54-unit development at 2478 South Purdue Avenue, also in\nSawtelle\n.\nThe area to the south of the Expo/Bundy station has seen a number of developments spring up after being rezoned from single-family use to clear the way for multifamily development as part of the Expo Transit Corridor neighborhood plan. Carmel Partners, for example, has already taken advantage of the new zoning regulations to\nbuild projects in Sawtelle\nto the tune of more than 600 units combined.\nThe 2219 South Wellesley project is expected to be completed in 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate Partners didn\u2019t just swoop in\nto take over Greenland USA\u2019s troubled Brooklyn project: It also bought up most of the firm\u2019s debt in the U.S.\nCirrus\u2019 Joseph McDonnell on Thursday said that his company purchased a majority of the outstanding debt held by\nthe struggling Greenland\n, which is a subsidiary of Shanghai-based conglomerate Greenland Group.\nHe said that debt was valued at $200 million, excluding the more than $300 million tied to Pacific Park.\nDuring a public meeting on Thursday, McDonnell provided some more details on how Cirrus restructured Pacific Park,\na long-delayed development in Prospect Heights\nthat was supposed to deliver 6,400 apartments, of which 2,250 would be affordable. Under a 2014 agreement, developer Greenland was supposed to finish the affordable units \u2014\u00a0of which 876 have gone unbuilt \u2014 by May 31, 2025.\nThis week, the state approved a joint venture led by Cirrus and LCOR to\ntake over the sites\n. Through a foreclosure auction, six rail yard sites were transferred to the team. Through a separate deal, the joint venture also took over a site near the Barclays Center, referred to as site 5, and development rights tied to a public plaza in front of the arena. Greenland previously planned to transfer those rights to build a larger project at site 5.\nThis handoff is a long time coming. In 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million tied to the rail yard sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s USIF, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owned a stake in the debt. Greenland, USIF and Fortress are part of the new joint venture, but will not have a role in the day-to-day management of the project.\nCirrus paid outstanding bills to architects, engineers and others who have worked on the project and took care of other liabilities, according to McDonnell. Some of those bills were paid in the form of new debt issued by Cirrus. As part of the new arrangement, USIF and Fortress took a deferred interest in repayment of new debt on the project, discounted for their stake in the new joint venture and subordinated to Cirrus and LCOR.\nGreenland has already invested $950 million in the project.\nChanging hands to forge ahead\nMcDonnell said Cirrus\u2019 takeover of all of Greenland\u2019s U.S. debt provided leverage to come to an agreement on how to move forward at Pacific Park.\n\u201cThis project, as everybody knows, has been stuck for a period of time. It was carrying a debt load which was unsustainable even when rates were lower,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the leverage we had over those three counterparties, Greenland, USIF and Fortress, we came in to clean up the structure so that it can hopefully move forward at a quicker pace.\u201d\nGreenland\nbought a 70 percent stake in Pacific Park, previously Atlantic Yards, in 2013, eventually taking another 25 percent as the previous developer, Forest City Realty Trust, backed away from development and eventually\nsold\nits assets to Brookfield Asset Management.\nThe firm was then hit by economic challenges, including China\u2019s slowing economy and the government\u2019s\nscramble\nto pull back on its U.S. investments and save developers who took on excessive debt. Then the pandemic hit, and interest rates soared. Greenland began trying to sell off its California assets, including its trophy apartment tower in Los Angeles known as Metropolis, which it sold at a\n$200 million\nloss in late 2022.\nAdditional details on Greenland\u2019s other debt taken over by Cirrus were not immediately available.\n\nMcDonnell and Anthony Tortora, co-chief investment officer and principal at LCOR, gave a brief overview of their companies at Thursday\u2019s meeting, held by the Atlantic Yards Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Empire State Development that reviews and makes recommendations on the project.\nMcDonnell repeatedly said the development team is not \u201ccondo-focused,\u201d and that Cirrus is dedicated to \u201cmaking a dent in the housing crisis\u201d by building housing accessible to a range of incomes. He noted that \u201cit is a lot easier\u201d to make the development work with condos, so the team expects public investment alongside private money. The developers didn\u2019t provide any information on how they will seek to change plans for the sites.\nMembers of the Atlantic Yards Community Development Corporation raised concerns about the project\u2019s timeline, given that the platforms over the rail yards between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue could alone take years to construct. That, along with the time it will take for an environmental review and for a new plan to be approved, could mean construction of buildings won\u2019t begin until after 2030.\nSome also asked how the platforms over the rail yards will be financed, and raised the possibility of implementing a similar arrangement to Hudson Yards. There, Related Companies is using $2 billion worth of payments in lieu of taxes to pay for a platform over train tracks on Manhattan\u2019s West Side.\nThe developers didn\u2019t specify how much public subsidies it is hoping will help finance the housing and platforms, but indicated that it is looking at a number of city and state programs.\n\u201cThe current plan for the rail yards predates the iPhone,\u201d Tortora said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity to optimize the plan, bring it current, which will facilitate the delivery of more housing, more affordability.\u201d\nChanges to the project will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of the development. The state expects to begin a public engagement process in November.\nAs part of its agreement with the state, the developers will pay $12 million, in installments, to a fund that will finance affordable housing in the neighboring communities. The payment comes\nafter ESD halted fines\nthat were intended to kick in when Greenland missed the May 2025 deadline. Missing that deadline was supposed to result in fines of $2,000 per month per unfinished affordable housing unit \u2014 a sum that would ultimately be far greater than the $12 million.\nIf the developers do not sign a memorandum of understanding outlining the new project by July 31, 2026, the state could impose the 2014 fines.\nMichelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, which is a member of BrooklynSpeaks, a coalition that was party to the 2014 agreement, said $12 million is not sufficient to make up for the level of displacement seen in the surrounding neighborhoods as residents waited for this housing to be delivered. She said she doesn\u2019t believe ESD has not always acted in the best interest of the public.\n\u201cThis is a long time coming. We\u2019re at a critical moment, and there\u2019s obviously decades of distrust and skepticism that need to be overcome,\u201d she said, noting that she was referring both to the developers and ESD.\nIn an interview this week, Assembly member Jo Anne Simon expressed the need to establish that the project is feasible after multiple developers have been unable to deliver.\n\u201cMy concerns are, we\u2019ve gone a long time without this housing,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we have any faith in what is being done here?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Fourth &amp; Central development in Downtown Los Angeles got the green light from the Planning Commission Thursday, inching the $2 billion project closer to final approval.\nPlans for the 7.6-acre site at 4th Street and Central Avenue call for 1,589 residential units with a minimum of 249 affordable units, along with 401,000 square feet of creative office space and 145,748 square feet of retail and restaurants.\nA master plan of the site proposes 10 buildings, ranging in height from two to 30 stories. In addition to residences and commercial space, the project would include 2 acres of public open space on the street level.\nThe City Planning Commission unanimously voted to recommend approval of Fourth &amp; Central.\n\u201cThis project represents a significant stride toward addressing the region\u2019s housing challenges,\u201d Nella McOsker, president and CEO of DTLA advocacy organization Central City Association, said at the meeting. \u201cPlus, the new retail and restaurant space will attract business and people to Downtown.\u201d\nHousing construction in Los Angeles has\nplunged\nsince early last year, nearing a 10-year low.\n\nFourth &amp; Central accounts for the biggest chunk of units in the\ncurrent pipeline\nof nearly 30,000 units on the drawing board for the downtown area.\nThe development,\nannounced by Denver-based Continuum\nin 2021\n, would raze a 130-year-old cold storage warehouse next to the Arts District and Little Tokyo. Continuum formed a partnership with the property owner, Los Angeles Cold Storage, to develop the site.\u00a0Continuum is no longer involved in the project, a spokesperson for L.A.

        "content": "A federal judge dismissed a\nlawsuit filed by a group of Winnetka homeowners\nagainst the village over new regulations on lakefront construction, dealing a temporary blow in the legal battle over the contentious ordinance.\nThe homeowners brought the lawsuit in May 2024 in response to a Winnetka ordinance that restricts constructions on the bluffs along the lakefront. The ordinance creates a setback limiting development from the toe of the property\u2019s bluff or 50 feet from Lake Michigan\u2019s high water mark, whichever is farther from the high water mark.\nThe lawsuit, joined by more than a dozen homeowners, argued that Winnetka\u2019s ordinance amounted to an unconstitutional taking of their property without compensation. They argued the ordinance may reduce property values \u201cin the hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d cumulatively along the lakefront.\nU.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt ruled Oct. 3 that it was too early for the homeowners to claim damage from the ordinance. The judge said that because none of the plaintiffs had submitted development plans or been denied permits under the new rules, the court could not determine if any harm had actually occurred. Two other counts in the lawsuit alleged violations of the Illinois Constitution, but the judge ruled only on the federal claim.\n\u201cThe village is pleased that the court granted the village\u2019s motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the complaint,\u201d Peter Friedman, Winnetka\u2019s village attorney, said in a email.\nThe plaintiffs have until Oct. 30 to file a new complaint in response to the judge\u2019s ruling. An attorney for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJena Radnay\n, a broker with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate who deals in multimillion-dollar lakefront homes, said she expects the homeowners to file an amended complaint to keep the lawsuit going.\nRadnay told\nThe Real Deal\nshe knows at least six lakefront homeowners who have considered selling but are worried their home\nvalues could fall by millions of dollars\napiece because they don\u2019t have modernized amenities in the areas that they\u2019re now restricted from building in. Houses with such features, like pools, recreational facilities and stunning waterfront viewing rooms, are what buyers are after in the North Shore power town, Radnay said.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole silent slew of lakefront owners sitting back waiting to see what the lawsuit is going to do,\u201d Radnay said, adding she fears there could be cuts by as much as 30 to 40 percent at some properties.\nEven though Winnetka\u2019s lakefront homes reached unprecedented values for Illinois this year, as Radnay recently brokered the\n$31 million waterfront sale\nof a former Goldman Sachs executive\u2019s house, that\u2019s only because such properties had been recently updated and \u201coptimized\u201d before the ordinance took effect, she said.\nPlus, the sellers of the record-breaking deal this year spent far more assembling the land on which their property sits and improving it over the years, with their investment in the home likely exceeding $60 million.\nThe village has maintained that the regulations are necessary to protect the bluffs from erosion and are in the interest of public safety. The ordinance was passed unanimously in February following heated public meetings.\nThe passage of the ordinance, along with a separate ordinance from December limiting lot consolidation, was largely in\nreaction to billionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s sprawling construction\nproject in the village. In 2023, Ishbia pieced together multiple properties in order to create a 68,300-square-foot megamansion. The properties and construction cost $78 million.\nIshbia\u2019s project included removal of greenery and destruction of the lakefront bluffs, which caused controversy in the village and prompted the new restrictions on lakefront constructions.\nOther North Shore towns with high-end lakefront property have long had restrictions on development along the lakeshore bluffs. Highland Park and Evanston require 40-foot setbacks from the property\u2019s bluff, while Kenilworth requires a 35-foot setback and Glencoe\u2019s requires setbacks on a case-by-case basis. Lake Forest requires a 75-foot setback from bluffs.\n",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has long run a processing center in Broadview, a west suburban site that\u2019s become a flashpoint between agents and protesters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down, and we\u2019re going to be in more parts of Chicago,\u201d Noem said during a cabinet meeting. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out in the streets.\u201d\nThe comments followed Noem\u2019s visit to Broadview last week, where she told ICE and Border Patrol agents she wanted to buy a nearby building. The Broadview location has served as the command center for Chicagoland\noperations\n.\nConservative influencers embedded with the administration\u2019s deportation\ncampaign\nlater posted videos of Noem and officials touring vacant warehouses across the metro area as potential ICE sites. It\u2019s unclear which facilities DHS is pursuing or whether purchases are imminent.\nThe real estate push adds a new layer to the federal government\u2019s growing physical presence in and around Chicago. The\nSun-Times\nreported National Guard troops began arriving outside the city this week, including at the Broadview facility, while courts weigh the legality of the deployment.\nThe agency also ramped up security spending recently. Noem said DHS is \u201chardening all of our buildings\u201d in response to a September shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, adding that measures could include rooftop snipers and expanded protective teams.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions from\nCrain\u2019s\nabout where or how it plans to expand. But any purchases could ripple through the region\u2019s industrial and office markets, where\nfederal tenants\noften pay top dollar and can alter local property dynamics overnight, leaving little room for\nlegal recourse\n. It was also unclear why DHS is considering purchasing locales rather than renting space.\nMeanwhile, the federal government said in March it plans to cancel leases and shut down Chicago offices for Health and Human Services and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Los Altos Hills officials might be having some buyer\u2019s remorse about allowing housing in the tony enclave.\nThe town council is looking to reduce the size of a multifamily development, which includes the municipality\u2019s first affordable housing, after voting in 2023 to legalize apartments at Twin Oaks Court, Cal Matters\nreported\n. The vote came out of a need to meet state-mandated housing requirements of 489 new units by the end of the decade as part of the town\u2019s housing element.\nNow, the proposed Twin Oaks Court development could be shaved down in size. Developer Twin Oaks Court LLC filed a preliminary application for a 598-unit project there, hoping to take advantage of state density bonuses by including 56 units for affordable housing. Residents revolted, however, and the council is looking to cut the site\u2019s capacity to 92 units total.\n\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been asking you to protect us from,\u201d resident Martha Bowden told officials. \u201cThis would be a disaster.\u201d\nThe idea of squeezing in hundreds of people on a small cul-de-sac next to I-280 was \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d according to resident Michael Grady, who created a petition for the town to reconsider its original plan for the site.\n\u201cThis is illustrative of exactly why I\u2019ve been saying for over a year and a half that the housing element as drafted is a time bomb,\u201d Grady said.\nLos Altos Hills wouldn\u2019t be alone in its pursuit. Other wealthy enclaves like Carmel and South Pasadena have moved to tweak state-approved housing plans, often citing \u201ccalculation errors\u201d or resident backlash. In Sausalito, officials successfully reduced densities on a contested condo site, while Rancho Palos Verdes tried the same before backing off under legal pressure.\n\n\u201cLocal agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project,\u201d the California Housing Defense Fund, wrote in a\nletter\nto the California Department of Housing and Community Development on Los Altos Hills.\nGovernor Gavis Newsom has also stood fast behind the\nstate\u2019s mandated goals\nin the housing element.\nSome residents, though, are on board with the plan to keep as many units as possible at the site.\n\u201cAfter the housing element was accepted, residents and the council were wailing, \u2018But it\u2019s steep at Twin Oaks,\u2019\u201d Anne Paulson, a member of the Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance, said. \u201cThey nevertheless chose those sites, instead of flatter sites down the hill. They shouldn\u2019t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.\u201d\nThe fight over the Twin Oaks project\u2019s size is indicative of the larger long-running issue of state versus local control in housing development. \u201cWe\u2019re in the testing-the-waters phase,\u201d Matt Gelfand of Californians for Homeownership said. \u201cIf some smaller cities can get away with it, others will follow.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Midtown Capital Partners advanced its plan to build 300 apartments, including 60 affordable housing units, on a parking lot at a Plantation office park, under the state\u2019s Live Local Act.\nThe Plantation City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a site plan for the six-story multifamily development on a parking lot that has an industrial land use designation and is zoned for light industrial operations.\nThe 7.9-acre development site at 7510 West Sunrise Boulevard is an under-utilized parking lot at the\nPlantation Pointe office park\n, where entertainment technology company\nMagic Leap\nand pet supplies retailer Chewy have their headquarters.\n\u201cThe location is a parking lot that is seldom used. If you drive by there, on most occasions, you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s vacant,\u201d Dan Holmes, Plantation\u2019s director of planning, zoning and economic development, said at the city council meeting.\nMiami-based Midtown Capital Partners, led by CEO and managing partner Alejandro Velez, bought the parking lot as part of its\n$56.6 million\nacquisition in 2017 of multiple properties at Plantation Pointe, including two buildings at 7600 and 7700 West Sunrise Boulevard that span about 221,000 square feet.\nThe 60 rent-restricted affordable housing units that Midtown Capital plans to build will include 10 studios, 23 apartments with one bedroom, 21 with two bedrooms and six with three bedrooms.\n\nThose 60 apartments, which equate to 20 percent of the 300 planned apartments at\nPlantation Pointe\n, will remain affordable housing units for 20 years under a declaration of restrictive deed covenants that Midtown Capital agreed to execute.\nUnder the Live Local Act, if a developer chooses to designate at least 40 percent of planned dwellings as affordable housing, the project is subject only to administrative municipal approval and bypasses a local government\u2019s review in a public hearing.\nIf at least 10 percent of the dwellings are designated as affordable housing, the state law gives local governments the option to hold a public hearing to review the project.\n\u201cIn this case, the applicant [Midtown Capital] is requesting to provide 20 percent of the units as affordable,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cUnder the Live Local Act, they\u2019re asking to bypass \u2026 rezoning and land use [changes]. So, that\u2019s something the city council has the discretion to do or not.\u201d\nPlantation\nCity Council member Jennifer Andreu unsuccessfully proposed a declaration of restrictive covenants under which 60 of Midtown Capital\u2019s planned apartments would remain affordable housing units for 30 years instead of 20 years.\n\u201cI feel 20 [years] is a reasonable request,\u201d said Timothy J. Fadgen, another member of the city council, \u201cbecause they are giving us double [the percentage of units] what they\u2019re required to under the Live Local [Act].\u201d",

The offices are minutes away from landmarks like\nSouth Coast Plaza\nand Metro Pointe at South Coast malls and\nJohn Wayne Airport\n.\nEarlier this year, the Costa Mesa City Council considered a proposal from Bay Area-based multifamily developer Legacy to demolish the existing office buildings at The Hive to make way for a new mixed-use development.

        "content": "Los Angeles-based developer Caruso hasn\u2019t built in its hometown for years\u2013and that\u2019s intentional.\nRick Caruso, who runs his namesake company, revealed that strategy on Thursday when he took the stage during Bloomberg\u2019s Screentime conference held at the campus of Nya Studios in Hollywood. Caruso delivered a talk mainly to the Hollywood, media and tech crowd, but nevertheless focused on the city\u2019s issues around affordable housing, taxes and post-wildfire rebuilding.\n\u201cAs a company that takes great pride in being L.A. based, we no longer build within the city of Los Angeles because of the unpredictability, the cost of doing it [and] the multiple layers of bureaucracy you have to go through for approvals,\u201d Caruso said on stage. \u201cAnd I made that decision long before I ever ran for office [in 2022].\u201d\nThe developer of retail centers, including Americana at Brand, The Grove, and\nPalisades Village\n, went on to attribute 40 percent of housing costs to regulations. That includes the permitting process, parking requirements for multifamily, energy efficiency and seismic standards and environmental impact reviews. Since 2023, developers can also tack Measure ULA, a city-specific tax on all property transactions starting at $5.3 million, on the other end of the deal, often making an eventual sale more difficult or less profitable.\n\u201cWhat people need to understand, what leadership needs to understand, is money is going to travel in directions that have the less friction to it, the less risk to it,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cAnd L.A. is redlined now, because of the fires, because of the homeless problem, because of the crime problem. Find a crane in L.A. In 10 years, the lowest amount of housing is now.\u201d\nCaruso delivered a roughly 20-minute talk on stage in which he walked the line between airing out issues in the city from the perspective of a developer and resident, to\ncampaigning\n.\nThat would include what some have viewed as attacks on Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass since January\u2019s Palisades Fire. Wednesday\u2019s release by the fire department of the after-action report for the blaze further fanned critiques around the wildfire response. The long-awaited assessment indicated a number of operational lapses, including communication issues, lack of adequate staffing and water supply problems.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go on the attack; I was honest,\u201d Caruso said when asked about his statements made around the fire. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m attacking Karen Bass. I\u2019m not attacking Karen Bass. I\u2019m saying what the facts are and now we know it. It\u2019s in black and white.\u201d\n\nChatter\nhas continued to mount since January on whether Caruso might make another run for Los Angeles mayor or perhaps a go at California governor. He has repeatedly stated publicly his intent to make a\ndecision\nby the end of the summer.\nWith that deadline now passed, Caruso kicked the can further into the future and said he\u2019ll decide \u201cwhen I decide.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m waiting for? I\u2019m taking this very seriously,\u201d he said at the conference before stating his priority is Steadfast LA and the rebuilding.\nThe nonprofit he launched in February has focused on public-private partnerships aimed at expediting rebuilding in Altadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu. The group linked early on with prefab home builder and Airbnb spinoff\nSamara\non a program that will give about 100 homes to fire survivors unable to rebuild their homes.\nCaruso\u2019s also been credited with pushing for the use of\nArchistar\n, an artificial intelligence-backed software that is now being used by the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County to fast-track permitting. Steadfast, LA Strong Sports and the city of L.A. also partnered to rebuild the Palisades Park and Recreation Center.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a candidate; I want to get this work done,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got time to be a candidate.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The saga over the debt backed by 201 California Street is heading into a new chapter.\nRidge Capital Investors is working to acquire a loan backed by the Financial District property for approximately $75 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. That price would value the 17-story, 273,333-square-foot building at about $275 per square foot.\nIf the deal closes, it would end years of questions about the building\u2019s ownership fate. The 201 building is currently owned by\nColumbia Property Trust\n, which is\nlooking to offload the property\nafter defaulting on a $1.7 billion mortgage tied to 201 California and six other buildings in 2023.\nColumbia secured an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July of this year with the additional option to extend the maturity into early next year. The firm opted not to use that additional extension and wasn\u2019t able to pay off the loan. By selling the debt to Ridge Capital, Columbia and its lenders can resolve the dispute without extending the loan further.\nMarketing materials for the debt pitched it as \u201ca path to ownership\u201d for the offices. If the deal closes, Columbia could opt to hand over ownership of the building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\nThe building\u2019s valuation collapse helps paint a picture of the troubles at 201 California. It was appraised at $81.5 million in February, down from $218 million in 2021. Columbia bought the property from Beacon Capital Partners in 2019 for $238.9 million. At the time of the 2019 sale, the building was 99 percent leased; when it hit the market this summer, it was just 35 percent leased.\nSnapping up distressed San Francisco offices is the name of the game for Ridge Capital. In 2023, the firm\nbought 180 Howard Street\nin a $54 million sale-leaseback. Earlier this year, much like what could happen with 201 California, it\nacquired a loan backed by 33 New Montgomery Street\nthrough a similar loan acquisition and deed in lieu of foreclosure process.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s condo market is starting to crack as condo markets in other Texas metros heat up.\nListings in Alamo City piled up in recent months as buyers retreated, forcing sellers to slash prices and offer perks to move units, according to a new Redfin report. There are 585 active condo listings in the city and just 120 buyers in the hunt, creating a roughly 4-to-1 seller-to-buyer imbalance, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMonths\u2019 supply of condos sits around six \u2014 the upper edge of what the San Antonio Board of Realtors considers a balanced market. That\u2019s causing many units to linger while sellers struggle to recalibrate.\nTexas cities have already been slower than peers around the country to embrace high-rise living, but the product type is even less popular in San Antonio. A sizable military population favors single-family homes or short-term rentals that can be offloaded easily, leaving condos sidelined, the outlet reported.\nMeanwhile,\nnew construction\nhas swelled supply by about 20 percent, adding lower-priced single-family alternatives to the mix, leaving buyers overwhelmed by local options, Local Redfin agent Jesse Landin told the outlet.\nThe local slowdown mirrors a national pattern.\nRedfin found that in August, there were 72 percent more condo sellers than buyers across the U.S.\u2014 the fifth straight month of oversupply. Rising costs are largely to blame. Homeowners association fees now eat up as much as a quarter of a typical buyer\u2019s monthly budget, while insurance premiums and special assessments for maintenance have climbed sharply since 2020.\nThose costs can kill deals. Landin cited a $250,000 condo that lost three contracts because its $1,000 monthly HOA fee drove total monthly costs near $3,000 for a 1,000-square-foot unit. Cancellation of San Antonio\nhome purchases\noverall has trended higher than the national average recently.\n\nAbout 10 percent of single-family and condo listings in San Antonio risk selling at a loss, Redfin found, which is above the national average. Investors have pulled back, with some resorting to converting units to short-term rentals just to stay afloat.\nBuyers\nhold the upper hand, currently. Sellers are starting to cover HOA fees or closing costs to sweeten deals, particularly around the Medical Center area, Landin said.\nMeanwhile, residents of other Texas metros have been flocking to luxury condo properties popping up in the Texas Triangle.\nIn Houston, developer\nSatya recently expanded its St. Regis condo tower\ndue to strong demand. Nearly 40 percent of the 90 units were reserved before construction started on the project. The now 38-story tower is set to rise at 102 Asbury Street between Memorial Drive and Buffalo Bayou.\nIn addition, the\nfirst standalone Ritz-Carlton condo tower in Texas\nis rising in the Woodlands. And,\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s London House in River Oaks pre-sold\nall but two of its 23 units at 2323 San Felipe Drive, reinforcing demand for vertical luxury living in the metro.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The firm focuses on developing apartment projects that include market-rate and workforce housing units via public-private partnerships with local governments.\n\u201cSouth Florida is the epicenter of the housing affordability crisis.\u201d Burns said in a statement. \u201cOver 60 percent of renters in the South Florida area are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent.\u201d\nThis marks the second time in five years that Affiliated looks to raise equity capital for its projects. In 2020, the firm launched its inaugural fund that raised $100 million, an Affiliated spokesperson said. The funds were used for current projects such as\nThe Pierce\n, a planned eight-story building with 236 apartments, half of which would be workforce housing; plus 16,800 square feet of restaurant and commercial space; and a 150-space garage in Boynton Beach. Affiliated is building the project on 2.3 acres that the firm acquired for $100 from the Boynton Beach Community Redevelopment Agency in exchange for providing the workforce housing units.\n\nThe inaugural fund also provided capital for The Dune, another planned eight-story project in Boynton Beach with 336 apartments and 2,600-square-foot of ground-floor commercial space;\nThe Era\n, a planned eight-story project with 400 apartments in Fort Lauderdale; and The Spruce, a planned 270-unit mixed-income apartment project in West Palm Beach.\nIn May, Affiliated scored an\n$80 million\nconstruction loan for The Era, and nabbed a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan for The Spruce last year. Bank of Montreal provided the financing for both projects.\nThe $250 million fund will provide equity capital for Affiliated\u2019s new pipeline of projects, including The Ray, a 400-unit mixed-income workforce housing development in Sunrise that was recently approved by the city, the release states.",

        "content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin, who owns well over $1 billion of South Florida residential and commercial real estate, wants to open a private megayacht marina in Miami Beach.\nGriffin, through an affiliate, filed a proposal for a 30,000-plus-square-foot marina with four buildings at 120 MacArthur Causeway, a 3.7-acre site on the tip of Terminal Island.\nThe facility will be exclusively for Griffin and his guests, adding to his massive real estate empire in Miami-Dade County, and further solidifying his hefty investment in South Florida. Griffin moved his Citadel hedge fund and sister company Citadel Securities\u2019 headquarters to Miami\u2019s Brickell from Chicago in 2022 and plans to develop a\n$2.5 billion\nbayfront supertall for the firms\u2019 main offices, also in Brickell. The 1.3 million-square-foot project will include a 212-key hotel, spa, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and more.\nGriffin, 56, owns a 308-foot Viva superyacht with interior design by Peter Marino, according to Superyacht Fan.\nThe Miami Beach Planning Board will vote on a conditional use permit requested for the marina at its Nov. 4 meeting.\nDesigned by BMA Architects, the project will include a gatehouse at the entrance of the marina with security offices, and a pavilion for crew members with laundry, kitchen, gym with sauna and showers and a \u201cmodest\u201d rooftop pool, according to the application. Also, the project will have an operations center with a repair shop and marina staff offices, as well as an owner\u2019s pavilion with a grand seating area, storage spaces and an adjacent pool.\n\u201cReflecting his long-term commitment to Miami, Ken is investing to improve an industrial section of Terminal Island,\u201d a Citadel spokesperson said.\nTerminal Island, which juts out from the MacArthur Causeway\u2019s eastbound lanes toward PortMiami, currently has a Florida Power &amp; Light plant, a Miami Beach maintenance facility and a parking garage and ferry terminals servicing the exclusive Fisher Island.\n\nThe marina development site previously was owned by the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, which scrapped its planned office project on the property. Coconut Grove-based Related originally had planned a 34-story, 90-unit condo tower, and then switched plans to a 160,000-square-foot office project that could have reached 75 feet in height.\nIn 2023, Related sold the property to multifamily developer Lincoln Property Company for\n$77 million\n, records show, canceling the office project. State corporate records show that the ownership of the entity One Island Park, which owns the marina development site, was amended in September to substitute Lincoln for people tied to Griffin.\nBecause the change in ownership was made through the acquisition of the interest in the ownership entity and not through a deed, Griffin\u2019s purchase price for the site is unknown.\nAccording to the South Florida Business Journal, which first reported on Griffin\u2019s proposed marina, the project could host private events during Art Basel or the Formula One Miami Grand Prix.\nForbes pegs Griffin\u2019s net worth at $50.6 billion, making him the 32nd wealthiest person in the world.\nIn Miami, Griffin paid a record\n$106.9 million\nfor Adrienne Arsht\u2019s 4-acre Coconut Grove estate at 3031 and 3115 Brickell Avenue in 2022. He also owns residential land in Palm Beach and waterfront properties on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island.\nHis Brickell office supertall is planned on a 2.5-acre site at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, a site Griffin bought for a record\n$363 million\nin 2022. As a whole, entities tied to Griffin have paid a total of nearly\n$670 million\nfor a Brickell assemblage, which totals about 4.2 acres\nIn the meantime, his firms are leasing space at the 830 Brickell office tower.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire developer Jeff Greene filed suit against West Palm Beach, alleging the city has improperly stalled approvals for his planned luxury condominiums.\nThe developer said he believes Mayor Keith James is delaying the project as retaliation for Greene\u2019s opposition to a city land deal with billionaire Steve Ross.\nThe suit, filed this week in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeks to force approval for Greene\u2019s\nHerzog &amp; de Mueron-designed condos\nplanned for the 4.5-acre site at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive, court filings show. The twin towers are slated to each span 30 stories with 76 units, and will include 5,100 square feet of commercial space.\nIt\u2019s been two years since Greene received approval for the project from the\nWest Palm Beach\nPlanning Board. But since then, plans have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo, according to the suit.\nRepresentatives for the city declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.\nAt the heart of the conflict is a land deal between Greene and the city. Greene had agreed to pay $6 million and swap land with the city to connect Northwood Road to the soon-to-be\nredeveloped Currie Park\n.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really hung up on whether I get a few dollars more or less for my land, but the city was totally unresponsive,\u201d Greene said. \u201cThey just dragged their feet, dragged their feet.\u201d\nThe 2023 approval mandated the developer and city close the transaction before a building permit is issued, the suit shows. In communications between Greene\u2019s representatives and the city, city planners argue the land deal is a condition of final approval, not just a condition of issuing the building permit. The city also did not recognize Greene\u2019s request for an extension when the planning board\u2019s approval was set to expire, the complaint shows.\n\nIn recent weeks, Greene received a letter from James stating the city would withdraw its height allowances for the planned 350-foot tall Herzog &amp; de Mueron-designed condos, capping the height for each at 111 feet, Greene said. He requested meetings with James, but the mayor canceled.\n\u201cHe was at my son\u2019s bar mitzvah, he\u2019s been to my home in the Hamptons,\u201d Greene said, describing a years-long relationship with James.\nGreene is not absolutely certain why the mayor would seek to punish him, but he suspects it has to do with Greene\u2019s opposition to an effort to\nsell Steve Ross 55 acres at a steep discount for the purpose of a school\n. In April, the West Palm Beach City Commission voted to begin negotiations with developer\nRoss\n, chairman of Related Ross, with a proposed sale price of $6.6 million. Greene said he found the sweetheart deal offensive, given his own investment into the Greene School and Bill Koch\u2019s $100 million donation to start the nearby Oxbridge Academy.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very kosher,\u201d he said of the Ross land deal. \u201cThis mayor is just using his power to go after me.\u201d\nGreene said he hopes his towers ultimately win approval, but if not he could pursue up to $1 billion in damages from the city. He also sees waiting as an option.\n\u201cWhat we would do is leave it empty and wait till there\u2019s another mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this mayor wants me to just be a land banker and not build anything, I won\u2019t build anything.\u201d\n",

It included city sign-off for annexation, rezoning and a development agreement on the long-anticipated project.\nThe community at 1100 East FM 150 \u2014 once known as Project Sahara \u2014 still needs a second reading and several follow-up steps, including formation of a public improvement district and a certificate of necessity swap for city utilities. Those are set for the council\u2019s Oct. 21 meeting.\nATX Capital\n, which acquired the site earlier this year from San Antonio\u2019s\nStreamline Advisory Partners\n, specializes in turning raw land into shovel-ready projects or partnering with other developers. The firm is also behind the 94-acre Legacy Park project in Hutto.\nCityPoint\u2019s plan calls for up to 630 multifamily units, split between market-rate and affordable housing, plus 330 single-family and townhome-style residences. About 70,000 square feet of commercial space is also slated, with 13 acres set aside for retail, 48 acres for single-family homes and 28 acres for apartments. Three acres will be donated for a municipal facility, along with nearly 18 acres for open space, trails and road expansion.\nConstruction is expected to unfold in four phases through 2038, starting with a 2027\u20132031 first phase that includes 315 multifamily units, 150 homes and 15,000 square feet of commercial and civic uses. ATX Capital committed to making at least 20 percent of the housing townhomes, a key condition council members pressed to preserve the city\u2019s comprehensive plan goals for higher density and \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing.\n\nSome council members, including Bear Heiser, expressed frustration that early concepts promising diverse housing types had been watered down.\nATX managing principal Jorge Canavati said the market, not intent, drove the mix.\nMayor\nTravis Mitchell\ncountered that existing townhomes in Kyle \u201call do extremely well.\u201d\nAustin-based Lionheart Places is leading urban planning for the project, which adds to a growing slate of large developments reshaping the\nfast-growing suburb\nabout 20 miles south of Austin.

Vroman\u2019s is an institution that also proved to be a pioneer among bookstores, offering itself as a \u201cthird space\u201d with amenities such as coffee bars, literary readings, live musical performances and an emphasis on local ties before chains such as Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders spread the concept to malls or main streets across America.\u00a0 Vroman\u2019s shelf-lined shop floor, cafe and wine bar has hosted literary legends ranging from Dr. Seuss and Joan Didion. Its longtime owner the Sheldon family announced it would sell the bookstore at 695 East Colorado Boulevard, and another in Pasadena and West Hollywood, last year.\n\u201cVroman\u2019s has been a part of Pasadena\u2019s history for over a 100 years. It\u2019s an honor to be able to be a part of that history in any way possible,\u201d GD Realty founder Arash Danialifar said.\nThe bookstore was founded by Adam Clark Vroman, who sold his book collection to raise the capital after his wife passed away. Upon his passing he left the bookstore to the great grandfather of the current owner.\n\nWhen current owner Joel Sheldon announced he was selling, he said it was time to go beyond the family and find a new owner with vision, energy and a commitment to preserve the shop. The 80-year old owner acknowledged the change can mean a time of some uncertainty but offered a sense of optimism, too.\nHe could not be immediately reached for comment upon the announcement of the sale.\nDanialifar\u2019s company recently purchased a nine-story office tower minutes away at 790 East Colorado Boulevard, a thoroughfare famous for hosting the annual Rose Parade to mark New Year\u2019s Day, for $31.5 million. That was a nearly 50 percent discount compared with its prior $59 million price.\n",

        "content": "Chicago tech and media entrepreneur Michael Ferro is giving his Gold Coast penthouse a multimillion-dollar facelift.\nFerro and his wife, Jacqueline, are planning an estimated $2.85 million renovation of the 8,000-square-foot penthouse they bought last year for $7.7 million, according to city building permits filed in July, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe project will bring the couple\u2019s total investment in the landmark 1920s co-op at 1500 Lake Shore Drive to more than $10.5 million. That\u2019s about $1,312 per square foot. The Ferros already live on another floor in the same vintage building and appear to be expanding their home.\nThe planned work includes selective interior demolition, new partitions, system upgrades to mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure and the replacement of windows with fire-rated glass.\nThe building, designed by\nRosario Candela\nin partnership with Chicago firm McNally &amp; Quinn, is among a handful of the famed architect\u2019s designs outside New York and one of the Gold Coast\u2019s grandest co-ops.\nThe duplex, which spans the 24th and 25th floors, offers 5,000 square feet of outdoor space, including a rooftop lawn and fountain overlooking Lake Michigan. Inside, the residence features a 39-foot walnut-paneled gallery with hand-frescoed vaulted ceilings, original limestone staircases and a carved wooden ceiling soaring 20 feet above the living room.\nThe Ferros bought the property last year. Architect Dorota Betancur is overseeing the renovation.\nColette Cachey Smithburg\nis one of the couple\u2019s real estate brokers.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which historic details will survive the planned updates, but the co-op\u2019s ornate craftsmanship makes any renovation a delicate balancing act between preservation and modern luxury.\nThe Ferros\u2019 Chicago project comes as the couple adds to a growing real estate portfolio. Earlier this year, Ferro purchased a\n$120 million\nmansion on\nStar Island off Miami Beach\n, one of Florida\u2019s priciest residential enclaves.\nFerro, 58, built his fortune through a string of technology ventures, including Click Commerce, and later became a major figure in Chicago media. He served as nonexecutive chairman of Tribune Publishing from 2016 to 2018 before selling his stake to Alden Global Capital, now the company\u2019s owner.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The space spans 3,900 square feet and has capacity for 250 guests.\nIngka Centres purchased a\nvacant 250,000-square-foot mall\nat 945 Market Street in 2020. Last year, it completed the transformation of the six-story property into\nSan Francisco\u2019s first IKEA store\n. The outpost came with a 46,000-square-foot co-working space on the fifth floor known as Hej!Workshop and a multi-level food-hall called\nSaluhall\n.\nL4 is part of Ingka Centres\u2019 plan to create a so-called mixed-use meeting place in downtown. When Ingka\u2019s work on the building is complete, the property will offer a mix of retail, office and entertainment options. The third floor of the building is vacant, while the fourth floor is closed to the public and mainly used for IKEA\u2019s offices.\nThe food hall hosted 11 vendors when it launched, and several other restaurant spaces on the second floor of the venue are available.\n\nIngka Centres is hopeful that its revamp of a blighted Market Street property will work in tandem with other similar projects to help revive foot traffic on the corridor. This includes renovations across the street at 934 Market, slated to house a long-awaited Jollibee location, the latest opening of a Ross Dress For Less at 901 Market, and\nUniqlo\u2019s announcement\nthat it\u2019s returning to the city at 801 Market.\nThe 945 Market building is \u201cabout contributing to the development of downtown San Francisco, with community at the center,\u201d said Miia Kautovaara of Ingka Centres. The company has been \u201cfocused on creating a place where people feel welcome, where they can gather, connect and experience something new,\u201d all while \u201cstaying flexible, listening closely to its neighbors and building strong local partnerships.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Cinematic interiors will nod to The Stoneleigh\u2019s Jazz Age origins.\n\nPlans also call for a reimagined pool and terrace, a new fitness center, and programming aimed at reviving the hotel\u2019s role as a cultural hub with live music, curated events and culinary pop-ups.\nThe only cost estimate available for the overhaul is $2.725 million according to a permit filed with the state in\nMay\n, but those fillings are often estimates, preliminary in nature and subject to change. The filing only lists the basement and level one public spaces for renovation with a completion date at the end of November of this year, meaning more filings and cost estimates are to follow.\nOpening just a decade after The Adolphus, The Stoneleigh is Dallas\u2019 second-oldest hotel and a cornerstone of Uptown\u2019s architectural and social history.

        "content": "Blink and you might have missed a string of recent changes to listings on StreetEasy.\nIn September, the platform introduced a new tool for agents to input all of the costs associated with renting an apartment. On the front end, the additions appear below the asking rent via the hyperlinked phrase \u201csee full breakdown,\u201d which opens a pop-up showing the amount due monthly and the upfront fees required to rent the apartment.\nThe update came on the heels of chatter among agents claiming StreetEasy had removed the Days on Market metric from for-sale listings. The count, however, is still featured, though much less prominently. It\u2019s now under the Property History section in a bulleted list alongside Price Change.\nWhile the changes to its interface may seem small, they mark the Big Apple-exclusive changes amid industry-wide conversations about the finer points of how brokers market their listings. StreetEasy has been fine-tuning its platform in recent months to fit a new set of circumstances.\nIt added the cost breakdown on rental listings in response to\nNew York City\u2019s FARE Act\n, which bars agents hired by landlords from charging tenants broker fees. A spokesperson for StreetEasy said the new tool will make it easier for agents to comply with the law and enhance transparency for tenants.\nBut the change to Days on Market has been accompanied by different interpretations. Some pointed to its rumored absence as the platform buckling under pressure from Compass CEO Robert Reffkin, who has\npublicly disavowed\nthe metric as potentially damaging to a seller\u2019s prospects.\nHowever, a spokesperson for Streeteasy said the choice to move Days on Market was a practical one, not a response to push back against its inclusion. (It\u2019s worth noting that Reffkin\u2019s brokerage, Compass, is\nsuing Zillow,\nthe parent company of StreetEasy, over a policy banning agents from listing properties once marketed as private exclusives on the platform, a policy the company adopted in response to the rollout of Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing plan.)\nThe spokesperson added that the platform decided to concentrate the top metrics on costs associated with purchasing the home, which would bring StreetEasy listings more in line with those on Zillow.\n\u201cFeedback from buyers shows they\u2019re looking to understand pricing information first and foremost \u2014 such as price, square footage, and estimated monthly costs \u2014 which informed this update,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in a statement.\nStreetEasy did, however, adjust the period required to reset days on market, shortening the timeframe from 90 days to 30 days.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nBarbara Corcoran\u2019s latest trade proves the real estate icon knows what she\u2019s doing.\nThe brokerage founder and \u201cShark Tank\u201d cast member found a buyer for her Upper East Side co-op just one day after putting it on the market and sparking a bidding war. The sale closed earlier this week for $13.5 million \u2014\nmore than $1 million\nover its asking price.\nThe deal was a flip for Corcoran, who bought the five-bedroom penthouse for $10 million in 2015 and spent $2 million on renovations.\nCorcoran\u2019s 3,800-square-foot home was featured on CNBC back in 2020, when she gave her fellow \u201cShark Tank\u201d star, Kevin O\u2019Leary a tour. However the apartment\u2019s hallmarks \u2014 a lush terrace overlooking Central Park and a glass solarium \u2014 weren\u2019t exhibited in their full glory until earlier this summer, when her home made the rounds on social media again after she listed it.\nCorcoran invited Caleb Simpson, an influencer known for asking strangers for tours of their apartments, to feature her home on his social media channels.\n\u201cWelcome to my penthouse,\u201d Corcoran\nsaid in a video\nposted to Simpson\u2019s YouTube channel, standing in front of a dining table in the solarium. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for seven years, but if you want it, and you\u2019ve got $12 million in your pocket to spend, I\u2019ll sell it to you.\u201d\nCorcoran\u2019s deal closed on the heels of a period of gains for co-ops in Manhattan, which logged a 6 percent annual uptick in signed contracts in September, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report for Douglas Elliman. Listings for the property type in the borough also rose 6 percent year-over-year.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit city records this week was a\ntie between two units\nat 220 Central Park South \u2014 though the condos, one directly below the other, could be headed for a combination. Unit Nos. 25A and 24A each traded for $16.2 million, which if purchased by the same buyer, would bring the total to $32 million.\nThe buyers listed in the city register are two different shell companies, though the contracts were signed on the same day. Unit 25A last traded for $13 million in 2018, while 24A sold for just under $12 million the same year.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern had the listings.\n",

        "content": "A conversion project is already on tap for the newly-rezoned Midtown South \u2014 it wasn\u2019t one city leaders expected.\nEarlier this week, developers Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger announced the\n$25 million purchase\nof 29 West 35th Street and their plans to turn the aging office into more than 100 studio apartments.\nNews of the project, the first to take shape in the neighborhood, is coming less than two months after the City Council approved the measure, and it stands in stark contrast to the building\u2019s fate just a year ago, when\nnot one person\nbid on it when it went up for auction at just $270 a foot.\nThough it\u2019s kickstarting development in the area, the building actually wasn\u2019t among the\nroughly 60 sites\nthe Department of City Planning identified as ripe for conversion. The city actually listed a parking garage next to the building as one of the likely locations instead of the building itself.\nThe rezoning is expected to deliver 9,500 housing units, according to the city\u2019s estimates \u2014 a conservative number that doesn\u2019t encapsulate all of the sites within the area that developers could turn into apartments.\nHeiberger said he and Burger had been keeping tabs on the rezoning leading up to the deal, though they signed the contract about four months before it crossed the finish line.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a lot of risk that this wasn\u2019t going to be approved, especially on the heels of City of Yes,\u201d Heiberger said. \u201cIt actually got approved three months earlier than we expected.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he and Burger were concerned about last-minute carveouts affecting the site, Heiberger said, \u201cno, we weren\u2019t worried at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a landmark, and it wasn\u2019t in the area they wanted to keep as the Garment District,\u201d he said. \u201cWe underwrote it based on potential to convert it without expecting air rights, so the air rights turned out to be a bonus.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The government officially shut down 10 days ago, and the country is starting to feel the impact. A shortage of air traffic control staffers has caused flight delays at several major airports, including Newark Liberty International Airport. The Trump Administration has also begun firing federal workers.\n\nBut as the shutdown continues, its effect on the industry remains unclear. Is the uncertainty holding up deals? Are buyers and sellers asking questions? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA former outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, Mike Greenwell,\ndied of cancer\non Thursday at age 62. Just last year, Greenwell won re-election to his seat on the Lee County Board of Commissioners, to which he was appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022. During his tenure, the board rezoned 76 acres of his land for development despite pushback from local residents.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A four-alarm fire ripped through a commercial building on Long Island on Thursday night, drawing roughly 200 firefighters to the site in Hicksville,\nNBC New York\nreported. The fire likely began in a restaurant in the basement of the building, spreading from there and damaging neighboring businesses, including a donut shop.\n\u2014 A potential nor\u2019easter is heading toward the East Coast, and Tri-State towns along the coast are expected to begin feeling its impact on Sunday,\nCBS News\nreported. Those counties have issued coastal flood alerts spanning Sunday and Monday. New York Harbor will be under a gale watch on the same days, as winds could reach as high as 50 miles per hour.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$5.7 million\nfor a triplex townhome at 230 Bergen Street. The Boerum Hill residence is 4,400 square feet and last sold on the market in 2013 for $2.8 million.\nCompass\u2019s\nTamara + Noah Team has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$572.3 million\nfor 1177 Avenue of the Americas. Silverstein Properties and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System sold the one-million-square-foot, 47-story building to joint venture Norges Bank Investment Management and Beacon Capital Partners,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45.5 million for 125 East 65th Street. The Lenox Hill mansion is 14,300 square feet.\nSerhant\u2019s\nMelissa Post and Ryan Serhant have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 33,564-square-foot, nine-story residential building at 3848 Bailey Avenue in the Bronx. Jakov Saric of Node Architecture, Engineering, Construction P.C. is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A Kenilworth house that mixes traditional architecture with modern updates has sold for $6.1 million, making it the most expensive non-lakefront property to sell in the North Shore village since at least 2020.\nThe 8,100 square-foot house at 149 Kenilworth Avenue was designed in 1896 by architect Franklin Pierce Burnham. The house maintains the original neoclassical facade, but it went through major renovations in 2022 that transformed the interior with an open floor plan and modern finishes.\nThe house, on a 0.6-acre lot, has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a detached three-car garage that includes an office. The backyard hosts a large enclosed patio with a pizza oven and grill.\nThe extensive interior work and expansion of the back of the house was led by the previous owners, Stephan and Janet Scholl, who bought the property in 2021. The identity of the buyers hasn\u2019t yet been made public in real estate records. John Mawicke of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who represented both the buyer and seller in the deal, didn\u2019t provide comment.\nIt was initially listed in July seeking $6.85 million, making the final sale price of $6.1 million an 11 percent cut from the ask. There doesn\u2019t appear to have been a previous non-lakefront sale for more in the village\u2019s history, according to public real estate records.\nThe Scholls bought the house in 2021 for $3.82 million. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 under its previous owners, Brad and Suzette Bernstein.\nThe house was built by the Kenilworth Company as part of the original development of Kenilworth in the 1890s. Its neoclassical design was a rarity in residential architecture at the time, and one of only a few houses in Kenilworth in that style.\n\nThe previous owners paid about $75,800 in\nproperty taxes in 2023\n, Cook County records show.\nThe house is a few blocks from the\nLake Michigan shoreline\n, and its price tag appears to be a record among inland Kenilworth properties. Even counting lakefront properties, it is among the most expensive homes sold in the village dating back to at least 2020, based on public listing services and reports.\nTwo other homes are currently pending sales with higher list prices: A mansion on Sheridan Road listed for\n$15 million went under contract\nin September, and a property off the lakefront on Cumberland avenue is under contract with a $6.5 million list price.\nThe Kenilworth house isn\u2019t the only new construction in the North Shore village known for historic buildings. Developer Leo Birov listed an upcoming new construction house this week\nnear the lake for nearly $6 million\n. The house is on part of the property he paid\n$6.8 million for in September\n, and it\u2019s likely another spec mansion is in the works on the second parcel there.\n",

        "content": "Commercial real estate professionals shuffled through a film set and gathered at stages five and six at the Lot at Formosa Wednesday morning \u2014 and after chatting over coffee and some very-L.A. breakfast burritos, they heard from Ethan Penner, the pioneer of commercial mortgage-backed securities running for governor.\nPenner is an independent candidate and a decided long-shot in our Golden State, but you would not have known the latter as he made his case to a room full of decision makers in a studio in West Hollywood.\nHe set his premise with a fundamental question: Is real estate still all about location, location, location? After all, downtown Los Angeles was hot once and now it\u2019s not \u2014 something his company knew all too well, he said, with soured investments that touched him personally.\nPenner then pivoted to the real reason he was on stage: Politics.\nHe showed some fang right off the bat, blaming politicians \u2014 not the pandemic \u2014 for the rough shape of downtown these days. Penner said we all made one of the worst decisions in entrusting politics to the politicians.\nPenner went on to trash the two parties and media for creating our current disconnect. He took aim at the toxic political atmosphere, mentioning that his son went through a breakup over the president (no more details on that unfortunately). Then he turned his longshot status into a flex of sorts, claiming that crazy things happen when there\u2019s \u201csystemic capitulation.\u201d\nUnplugged on ULA\nThe latter half of the conference was just as interesting, a panel on policy proving particularly so. Measure ULA, the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d came up. California Landmark Group\u2019s Ari Kahan said it wasn\u2019t the elephant in the room, but the elephant running through the room.\nKahan, similar to others, claimed the city is redlined so long as Measure ULA is in effect. That\u2019s because, he explained, it doesn\u2019t make sense to throw your capital at development when the economics don\u2019t make sense and a tax eats your profits.\nHe said all this while the Los Angeles Department of City Planning\u2019s Kevin Keller was one person down on the same stage. He did, however, give his public-sector colleague a break, noting that Measure ULA isn\u2019t a planning issue \u2014 rather something voters adopted in a citywide vote.\nThe Max Collaborative\u2019s Kevin Ratner didn\u2019t hold back either. Investors see beyond Measure ULA when coming up with reasons to cross L.A. off their list, with many steering clear because they don\u2019t want to be around when the next shoe drops, he said. It used to be worth it, going through the arduous entitlement and development process, because then you owned something in Southern California.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case anymore, he said \u2014 investors expect bad news around every corner now.\nWill the real Leo Pustilnikov please stand up?\nLeo Pustilnikov of Builder\u2019s Remedy fame has made another downtown buy.\nHe joined fellow investors in\npurchasing\nthe PacMutual, an office complex encompassing three interconnected structures, for less than $50 million. Ivanhoe Cambridge, now La\u202fCaisse, purchased the historic real estate a decade ago for $200 million.\nIt\u2019s the second piece of DTLA history for Pustilnikov, who a month earlier\nbought\nthe Original Pantry, a shuttered diner once owned by the late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. Pustilnikov said the beloved restaurant and its workers were making a comeback.\nWhen he made his office buy, he and partners said they were thrilled to contribute to downtown\u2019s revival as the owners of the century-old architectural jewel box.\nIt raises the question of whether Pustilnikov is a white knight, a bargain buyer \u2014 or both?\nRetail deals by the numbers \u2014 all the way up to nine figures\nDeal number one:\nA company connected to Metlife sold the two-story shopping center called One Westside to an entity that names Mark Darwish as a manager for $66.9 million, records show. Darwish confirmed the deal; the seller declined to comment.\nDeal number two:\nMamo\u2019s Long Beach Marketplace, an outdoor retail center,\nnotched\na $56 million refinance. LoanCore Capital provided the fresh financing on the property, which is home to fan-favorite Trader Joe\u2019s and, eventually, apartments, if all goes as planned.\nDeal number three:\nCenterCal Properties, owner of 2ND &amp; PCH, and DRA Advisors\npurchased\nthe Long Beach Towne Center for $145 million.\n",

        "content": "The South Shore immigration raid that shook Chicago late last month wasn\u2019t just about border politics. It was about real estate, including some buildings that have been falling apart for years while\nowners, lenders and the city point fingers\n.\nAs\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported,\ncommercial property dysfunction served as a prelude\nto federal enforcement. The 130-unit complex at 7500 South South Shore Drive \u2014 where ICE and other federal agents charged in with ground forces, rappelled from helicopters and arrested 37 people \u2014 was already deep in foreclosure and buried in lawsuits.\nThe city had sued property owner Trinity Flood over chronic code violations. Flood sued the previous owner and its brokers.\nWells Fargo had moved to foreclose\non three of Flood\u2019s South Side properties after she defaulted on a $27 million loan, going so far as to seek a court-appointed receiver to take over the properties.\nAmid the rigamarole, the complex devolved into chaos:\nsquatters\n, shootings and hallways so neglected inspectors stopped entering.\nThe collapse became a petri dish for a federal operation.\nStrength in Management, the firm hired last year to help stabilize the property, allegedly couldn\u2019t get a handle on it; city lawyers wrote that the company had \u201clost control.\u201d Tenants said the elevators were broken, security had been cut well before the feds arrived.\nCorey Oliver of Strength in Management\ndeclined to comment when reached by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhen feds step in\nWhen local oversight evaporates, federal agencies step in. Their arrival in Chicago isn\u2019t necessarily to fix real estate, but Trump\u2019s troops are apparently looking to occupy a good bit of the stuff. And, like much of what\u2019s\nbuzzing around the city these days\n, there\u2019s little clear about how that might happen or what it might look like.\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nSecretary Kristi Noem said the agency is looking to buy more real estate\nin the Chicago area, but her representatives won\u2019t say what kind or why. Asked by\nTRD\nwhether the department needs new facilities to sustain its immigration crackdown, officials refused to elaborate, instead citing Noem\u2019s vow to \u201cdouble down\u201d in Chicago.\n\nThe answers, or lack thereof, underscored a lack of transparency around the latest phase of immigration enforcement.\nThere is some overlap between housing instability and federal policing, and the dynamic isn\u2019t unique to Chicago. Across the U.S.,\nICE raids have sent shockwaves\nthrough rental, labor and residential development markets.\nIn Los Angeles,\nhomebuilders grew uncertain over labor markets\namid immigration raids that threatened many construction workers in the region. Similarly,\nMiami\u2019s construction sector\nhas been hit repeatedly, with ICE detaining hundreds of workers across South Florida and Tallahassee. Builders warned that lost labor, combined with rising material costs, could slow the pace of residential and commercial projects for months, if not years.\nAnd\nTexas landlord and tenant advocacy groups have struggled\nto respond to what they describe as \u201csubpoena abuse,\u201d highlighting the difficulty property owners face in navigating federal investigations.\nHousing market chill\nGrigory Pekarsky\n, head of Chicago residential brokerage\nVesta Preferred\n, told\nTRD\nthat the raids are producing a chill over the market, as some would-be buyers who have been looking for property in the area are ending their searches.\n\u201cThere\u2019s people dropping out, just simply because they\u2019re getting a bad sense of what is actually going on in Chicago,\u201d he said, noting that political rhetoric, even from the White House, amplifies fear. \u201cBusiness is down at certain places, like restaurants. All of that is just negative for the overall sense and feel of the economy.\u201d\nPekarsky emphasized the interplay between sentiment and markets. Showings are up, but offers are lagging. \u201cListings are just not getting anywhere near the showing traffic that you would think, even though it\u2019s a great piece of real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, through the showings that it does get, it doesn\u2019t get the offer that you would think. You\u2019re getting 30 tours with no offers. You should be getting at least two offers from that point.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Three downtown Dallas buildings have defined the city through the eras:\nNeiman Marcus\n, Dallas City Hall and American Airlines Arena.\nNow all three are in question as city leaders strive to reshape downtown to fit the city\u2019s image as a growing metropolis and\nfinancial center\n.\nDowntown Dallas\u2019 sustained problems with vagrancy and\ncrime\n, along with outdated office-building inventory, are among the turning points pushing the central business district to Uptown.\nThe crumpled status of the original Neiman Marcus store on Commerce Street hurts, and AT&amp;T\u2019s impending departure from downtown would be a brutal blow and a signal that those problems are\nbeyond urgent\n. The telecom giant spent $100 million just seven years ago to develop a four-block headquarters campus that included the AT&amp;T Discovery District with a food hall and public plaza. Now it is searching for office space in the suburbs, potentially taking the Dallas-based company\u2019s post-pandemic return-to-office spending out of the city.\nMeanwhile, the city\u2019s play to keep the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks arena in downtown could come with the\ndemolition of the I.M. Pei-designed Dallas City Hall\n. The city spent $100 million in 1978, overrunning its budget by $40 million, on a brutalist building that is meant to withstand the Texas sun and weather. More than that, it was meant to present Dallas to the world as a serious modern city after the JFK assassination dubbed it the \u201ccity of hate.\u201d\nPurchasing or leasing an office building could be in the cards for Dallas\u2019 next City Hall if Mavs owners Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont get a deal they like.\nCity leaders could be up against a wall there, as no one wants to be remembered for losing Dallas\u2019 last pro sports teams to the suburbs. Yet that scene could be set if Stars owner Tom Gagliardi\nexits American Airlines\nCenter in favor of Plano and the Mavs decide to develop\nan arena in Irving\n.\nAAC cost $420 million to build with major backing from city bond financing in 1996.\nAll of that is playing out against a backdrop of ambitious visions for downtown by real estate power players anxious to keep the city\u2019s center on pace with the new sheen of Y\u2019All Street that\u2019s coming with a slew of major financial industry moves in Uptown.\nThe city\u2019s $3 billion-plus\nconvention center redevelopment\nand Hunt Realty\u2019s\n$5 billion Reunion Tower-area megaproject\n, slated for thousands of apartment units, aim to turn the Union Station area into a happening neighborhood.\nRay Washburne\u2019s plans for the former Greyhound Station at 205 South Lamar Street, and Mike Ablon and Mike Hoque\u2019s proposal for Bank of America Plaza, at 901 Main Street, are also in the air lately.\nAll of the grand planning could be undone by\ncrime hotspots\n, which isn\u2019t the only point of tension when it comes to downtown dreaming. There\u2019s also the question of what Dallas is willing to offer Saks Global and AT&amp;T and the Mavericks and the Stars to retain key points of the city\u2019s identity.\n\nDowntown Dallas doldrums\nIf you doubt downtown has challenges, consider that nothing says hard times like a property auction.\nAnd Harwood Center, a half-empty office building at 1999 Bryan Street in downtown Dallas, is up for sale through online auction platform Marketplace.\nSeller\nCW Capital took over the 36-story asset from Fortis Property Group\nafter a winning foreclosure-auction bid of $80 million in 2021. Fortis bought the property in 2006 and spent $10 million on renovations in 2011, according to Morningstar Credit.\nDistressed CRE debt\nBig D and its downtown aren\u2019t alone\u2013the amount of commercial property headed to foreclosure auction in Texas this week\ndipped to $575 million\nthis week, despite broader concerns of a coming multifamily debt meltdown.\nPreston-Royal highrises\nIt\u2019s not all downbeat.\nLocal developers Burk Interests and Greenway Investment Company have a plan to redevelop 7 acres at the southwest corner of Preston Road and Royal Lane in Dallas, across from Central Market, with two high-rises. They are seeking a zoning change to develop\noffice, retail, condos and a hotel\nacross buildings rising 24 and 28 stories in Preston Hollow, where Burk Interests\u2019 Leland Burk has run for City Council in the past.\nPersonal guarantees gone wrong\nJohn Venetos is feeling the pain after personally guaranteeing $394 million in debt for his Dallas-based multifamily syndication firm Lurin Capital. Lender Acore Capital\nsued him for $80.7 million of that debt\nrecently, after foreclosing on a dozen of Lurin\u2019s Florida assets earlier this year.\n",

        "content": "Any guess why luxury home sales in San Francisco are up 14 percent year-over-year lately?\nOr why the high-end more than tripled the 4.2 percent year-over-year increase in overall sales in the city this summer?\nPut it on AI\u2019s tab.\nWith artificial intelligence exploding in the Bay Area, it\u2019s more than just offices and apartments that are being gobbled up by companies and employees. In fact, just like apartments, there\u2019s seemingly\nnot enough mansions to go around\nfor everyone.\nThe San Francisco real estate market is going through a mansion shortage, as AI barons and other well-paid executives and workers move into town and search for high-end digs to call home. As AI startups scale, luxury listings that previously sat unclaimed for months are now getting multiple offers within days of hitting the market.\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d luxury broker Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties,\ntold\nthe San Francisco Chronicle. Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said \u201cthe future wealth in AI\u201d is currently touring homes in San Francisco, whether they be $2 million condos or $20 million houses. \u201cThat wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Lynn said.\nThe mansion shortage is the latest evidence of the growing AI sector\u2019s effects on real estate throughout the city, whether residential or commercial. VTS\npredicts\noffice leasing from AI firms will accelerate in the coming months as demand from the sector has more than doubled in the past year. The city saw a 107 percent year-over-year increase in office demand as of last month, marking a more than 350 percent jump since\nOpenAI\n\u2019s ChatGPT was first released to the public in 2022.\nIn total, AI is expected to bring between 50,000 and 60,000 tech workers to San Francisco by 2030,\naccording\nto experts at CBRE. At the same time, the office footprint of these firms could balloon in that same period from around 5 million square feet to 21 million square feet by decade\u2019s end.\nLenders seize more SF offices\u2026\nWant a silver lining? The increasing willingness of lenders to take back buildings rather than play along with borrowers looking to \u201cextend and pretend\u201d could be taken as a sign of some fundamental faith in the Bay Area office market.\nLately the trend has visited the owners of the 1019 Market Street building, which fell into default in August. Lenders\ntook control of the building\nlast week in a foreclosure bid.\nThe building, once home to the headquarters of Zendesk, went for $10.3 million \u2014 a steep tumble from its appraised pre-pandemic value of $71.4 million. The previous owner was 1019 Market Street LP, reported to be an affiliate of Deutsche Bank asset management arm DWS.\nOther office buildings nearby have similarly faced foreclosure in recent months.\nIn August, a lender named JPMBB 2014-C22 Jackson Street LLC, listed in state records with an address at Starwood Capital Group\u2019s Miami office,\ntook over\nthe 244 Jackson Street building following a foreclosure auction.\n\nThat same month, lenders sued Kylli to place the office building at 225 Bush Street into receivership after the company defaulted on a $350 million loan backed by the property last November. In March, lender\nDeutsche Bank looked to sell\nthat distressed building.\n\u2026and other lenders look to do the same in San Jose\nThe\nunraveling of Z&amp;L Properties\u2019 Bay Area real estate empire\nhas prompted lenders to take action.\nA lending group linked to real estate executives William Wang and\nChris Jiashu Xu\nis\npursuing foreclosure\non the abandoned Greyhound bus station in downtown San Jose, the centerpiece of a monthslong fight over the Chinese developer\u2019s debt obligations. A Z&amp;L affiliate previously filed for bankruptcy in July to fight off any\nforeclosure\nthreat.\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to have done much. Now, a federal judge is trying to allow the lenders to proceed with a foreclosure seizure after handing down a ruling that would scuttle that bankruptcy case. But Z&amp;L quickly fought back by suing to block the foreclosure, claiming the lender lured them with a bait-and-switch when it came to securing a debt workout deal last year with a higher-interest loan it called \u201ca foreclosure trap.\u201d\nLike other projects in downtown San Jose, Z&amp;L had big plans for the Greyhound site but never followed through with its redevelopment. Z&amp;L agreed to renovate an old church and build housing towers on the site, though\nthe firm neglected\nit and the housing development fell apart, as did a proposed housing development on Terraine Street.\nDistressed office buildings need buyers\nIn the latest sign of the office market\u2019s slow-but-steady recovery in other parts of the Bay Area, the two-building Concord Tech Center in Concord is on the market.\nAfter lender Wells Fargo moved to pursue judicial foreclosure on the property following Partners Group\u2019s default on a $400 million loan backed in part by the East Bay office campus, court-appointed receiver Stapleton Group is now\non the hunt for a buyer\n.\nSan Francisco\u2019s One Market Plaza could be headed for a similar fate, as an $850 million loan tied to the building is nearing maturity and owners Paramount Group and Blackstone have yet to indicate what they\u2019re going to do. The duo have already\npaid down a loan\nbacked by the complex from $975 million to $850 million in order to\nsecure an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity\nfrom February 2024 to February 2026; an extension option included a forbearance that would push maturity to February 2028.\nAlameda neighborhood poised to go hungry\nBay Farm Island is in danger of losing its only grocery store, leaving residents in a food desert in the middle of San Francisco Bay.\nThe True Life Companies\nhas filed plans to build more than 300 homes on the site of the Harbor Bay Landing shopping center, anchored by a Safeway, the only grocery store on Bay Farm Island. Harbor Bay was identified by city officials as an ideal site to build new housing in order to meet state-mandated housing goals.\nTrue Life plans to demolish the existing 130,000 square feet of commercial space to clear the way for 305 new homes. Of those, 88 would be rental apartments and 217 would be for-sale townhomes; 55 of the units would be designated for affordable housing.\n",

        "content": "The gap between condo sellers and buyers in Miami is huge.\nA Redfin report found that in August, Miami had nearly 11,500 condo listings and just 3,270 buyers \u2014 250 percent more sellers than purchasers.\nMiami was No. 2 on Redfin\u2019s report. The biggest gap on a percentage basis was in San Antonio, Texas, where condo sellers outnumbered buyers 585 to 120 \u2014 by 386 percent. Other cities in Texas and Florida were among the five metros with the largest gaps, according to the report, which looked at the 50 most populous metros in the U.S.\nTampa, ranked third, with 241 percent more sellers (5,183 listings) than buyers (1,519).\nFarther down the list, Fort Lauderdale had 10,517 condo sellers to just 3,300 buyers in August: a 219 percent difference.\nIn Jacksonville, 1,808 sellers outnumbered 578 buyers, a 212.5 percent difference.\nOrlando had 2,886 sellers to 988 buyers, 192 percent more.\nAnd West Palm Beach had 190 percent more sellers (6,847) to buyers (2,359).\nThis trend isn\u2019t isolated to Florida or Texas. The report found that more sellers than buyers exist in all but seven of the biggest metros, including in Nassau County, N.Y., and Newark, N.J.. It makes sense. The housing market is still slow, and single-family homes hold more of their value than condos. Houses appreciate in value faster than condos due to the ownership of land.\nBut Florida, the condo capital of the U.S., is definitely feeling a bit more pain.\nWhat does this mean for the market?\nBuyers have more leverage, and should be able to score a good deal. But it\u2019s not so easy to purchase a condo today. Many buildings still don\u2019t have sufficient financial reserves, which means buyers who are using traditional financing have to put at least 25 percent down. A number of condo buildings are also beginning to fully fund their reserves or pay for maintenance and repair projects they had avoided for years, as required by the post-Surfside law.\nOther cost hikes make it difficult to purchase a condo: Insurance and property taxes are high.\n\nBut if you have the cash to pay for all of this, and eventually could resell the unit for a profit, you\u2019re in a good position. The issue is that most people can\u2019t afford that. The gap will remain high unless a large number of sellers sell (less likely), lower their prices (we\u2019re seeing lots of price reductions) or remove their listings from the market. Some will also have to sell at a loss, or could lose their condos via foreclosure.\nRedfin agent Cecilia Cordova wrote in the report that there\u2019s enough condo inventory for two years\u2019 worth of buyers: \u201cMy message for people who are interested in a Miami condo: Buy it now with no competition, if you have the buffer to afford future hikes in HOA fees and special assessments.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe aging condo stock in Palm Beach has\nweathered the worst\nof the crisis hitting buildings across Florida, and many buildings are in better physical and financial conditions than they were before. What other cities may be more insulated? And what cities will be hardest hit by the post-Surfside laws?

The buyers were Dan Fischel and Sylvia Neil, who are prominent legal experts from Chicago.\nCommercial\n: Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s Ponte Gadea acquired the Sabadell Financial Center at\n1111 Brickell Avenue\nin Miami for $274.4 million. New York-based KKR and Orlando-based Parkway sold the 30-story tower in what is the region\u2019s largest office sale so far this year.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe waterfront mansion at\n176 Spyglass\nLane in Jupiter hit the market for $39.9 million. George and Sarah Ann McMahon paid $24 million for the 1.5-acre property in 2021. The McMahons founded Palm Beach Gardens-based investment firm American Infrastructure Partners. Their 19,206-square-foot mansion, with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, was built in 2016 and expanded in 2023, according to the listing. The Admirals Cove property is on the market with Rob Thomson of Waterfront Properties &amp; Club Communities.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nWhooping cough cases in Florida have\nsurged 81 percent\nthis year, with 1,295 reported as of late September compared to 715 in all of 2024. Doctors warn that the alarming rise, which is driven by waning immunity and lower vaccination rates, puts babies and unvaccinated children at greatest risk.\nElsewhere in Florida\nBillionaire Ken Griffin said that Citadel\u2019s planned Brickell office tower will likely cost about $2.5 billion to develop, more than double earlier estimates, due to inflation and a \u201cmore fully developed site program,\u201d Griffin told\nBloomberg\n.\nGriffin is among the heavy hitters headlining the America Business Forum conference in early November. President Donald Trump, Lionel Messi and Will Smith will also be in attendance, marking Miami Mayor Francis Suarez\u2019s last hurrah before leaving office. Suarez is president of the event\u2019s board and was part of the effort to relocate the conference to Miami,\nBloomberg\nreports.\nThe new owners of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Galleria Mall, led by developer Russell Galbut, plan a major redevelopment of the property that could add nine 30-story towers, a hotel and workforce housing under Florida\u2019s Live Local Act. Galbut said the plans, which were filed by the previous owner, are being revised and will be resubmitted, according to the\nSun Sentinel\n.\nPublix Super Markets are now allowing open carry following a recent appeals court ruling that overturned the state\u2019s ban,\nMiami New Times\nreports. The publication called stores across Miami-Dade, including Brickell, Coral Gables, Sunny Isles Beach, Kendall and Doral.",

Dynamic Star, led by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, is developing the megaproject with Namdar and Gorjian Acquisitions.\nA mysterious lender, which shares an address with Brooklyn-based Cremac Asset Management, alleges entities tied to Segal and Zackson\u2019s Dynamic Star, along with their development partner Namdar Realty, owe $55.1 million on a loan tied to 320 West Fordham Road, according to the notice.\nThe lender also alleges the Dynamic Star entities owe $18.9 million on a loan for 2371 Exterior Street, 2391 and 2401 Exterior Street, and 301 West Fordham Road.\nTwo foreclosure auctions are scheduled for Dec. 2. The lender can credit bid using its existing debt to put it on a path to seize control of the properties at the auction, which will be overseen by Matthew Mannion of Mannion Auctions.\nThe non-judicial foreclosure auction compounds the intrigue of the development led by a strange cast of\nplayers\n, including Dynamic Star\u2019s\nBrad Zackson\n, a man known for acting as Paul Manafort\u2019s real estate fixer,\nNamdar\n, a distressed mall and office buyer, and an obscure Great Neck-based firm called Gorjian Acquisitions.\nIn Fordham Landing\u2019s north phase, Dynamic Star planned to build 2.7 million square feet with 1.8 million market and affordable housing, 744,000 square feet of office, and 143,000 square feet of retail, according to its website.\n\nFordham Landing\u2019s south phase plans to build over 900 units of 100 percent affordable housing. The developers secured over $55 million from the state to assist with site infrastructure. The project is also expected to provide public waterfront access, a new road and Metro-North station access to a vacant site south of the University Heights Bridge.\nBut parts of the development are now facing multiple foreclosures. And one of the developers, Dynamic Star\u2019s Gary Segal, alleges his business partner Igal Namdar is behind some of the project\u2019s recent problems.\nThe first sign of distress began in January when a joint venture between Blackstone and Rialto alleged the developers defaulted on a $55 million loan for four parcels in Fordham Landing North, and initiated a\nforeclosure\non the properties.\nBut the loan was eventually assigned to a new lender. The lender continued to pursue the foreclosure on the Fordham Landing properties.\nSegal alleged in court filings, however, Igal Namdar was the true buyer of the loans. Namdar, Segal alleges, bought the loans in an attempt to foreclose on Segal\u2019s equity interests and take control of the project. This amounted to a breach of Segal\u2019s loyalty as a partner, according to court filings.\nNamdar declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "A new class-action lawsuit claims that it\u2019s not just high interest rates that have made mortgages more expensive.\nHomeowners in Tennessee, Minnesota, Delaware and Rhode Island claimed that mortgage software provider Optimal Blue enabled nearly 30 major lenders, including Rocket Mortgage, CrossCountry Mortgage and United Wholesale Mortgage, to inflate residential mortgage fees and rates.\nPlano, Texas-based Optimal Blue provides market intelligence and pricing software to mortgage lenders. In 2019, it launched its pricing software, which gives lenders access to real-time pricing data provided by other lenders.\u00a0 As of this year, Optimal Blue counted 3,500 clients for its pricing analytics services, according to the complaint.\nThe complaint claims that in a competitive market, loan originators \u201cwould guard this data jealously. Instead, Defendants freely share this intelligence as the price of cartel membership, ensuring uniformly inflated mortgage prices for American families.\u201d\nThe lawsuit echoes the\nsuits filed against rent-pricing software RealPage\n, which have argued that its real-time rent pricing software allows landlords to collude to reduce competition and artificially inflate rents.\u00a0 Earlier this week, a host of landlords\nagreed to a settlement\nin their class-action case that would result in a payout of $141 million.\nThe proposed class includes borrowers who received residential mortgages priced using Optimal Blue starting in October 2021. The complaint claims that Optimal Blue and the named lenders violated antitrust laws, and are seeking unspecified damages.\n\nReuters first reported the lawsuit.\nThe complaint comes during a period in which borrowers have been hemmed in by persistently high mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hasn\u2019t fallen below 6 percent since Sept. 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nTennessee homebuyers have seen their monthly mortgage payments increased to over $1,600 from $1,029 since 2022, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also claims that the average prime offer rate for mortgages issued by Optimal Blue was almost 50 percent higher from mortgages issued by non-Optimal Blue users.\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 price-fixing scheme has transformed the American dream of homeownership into a financial nightmare for countless Nashville and Tennessee families,\u201d the complaint claims.\nOptimal Blue has had several owners in the past few years, all of whom are also named as defendants. Real estate data and analytics firm Black Knight purchased Optimal Blue from private equity firm GTCR in 2020.\nIn 2023, software conglomerate Constellation purchased Optimal Blue through its Perseus operating for $700 million.\n",

The final sales price isn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe four-bed, seven-bath home on two acres was designed by William Ward Watkin, a Houston architect who designed much of Rice University and served on the faculty in the early 20th century. The property includes a 9,900-square-foot, three-story main house and an 1,800-square-foot garage apartment over a three-car carriage house.\nThe sellers are Kenneth and Cara Moczulski, whom Preservation Houston recognized in 2021 for restoring the home. Kenneth Moczulski leads MM Properties, a real estate investment trust. Rancher and political donor Ashley Watt is the buyer, according to county records.\nNotably, the home beat out others in the River Oaks and Memorial neighborhoods, which typically dominate Houston luxury sales.\nNo other neighborhood cracked the top 11 listings of 2024\n. In 2022, the Memorial neighborhood had\nHouston\u2019s first single-family sale above $20 million\n. The country club-anchored River Oaks neighborhood had Houston\u2019s\nmost expensive sale of 2024\n, and it\u2019s taken the top monthly spot\nmore\nthan once\nthis year.\n\nThe other nine top September sales included three River Oaks homes and four Memorial Villages homes, according to HAR.\nVictoria Minton with Martha Turner Sotheby\u2019s International Realty listed the home.\nIt took some time to sell. The owners listed the home at $11.8 million in April 2023, cut the price slightly that September and then removed the listing in January 2024, according to Zillow. The home listed again in February for $11.25 million, left the market in April, then relisted again for $10.6 million last October, remaining on the market for almost a year until the parties closed on September 2.\nAlthough the luxury market is softening in many metros\n, Houston luxury homes had the lowest median days on market of any city in Texas in August, according to Redfin. The median sale price of Houston luxury homes, categorized as the top 5 percent of the market, rose 5 percent year over year to $1.3 million.\n",

The chairman of GFP Real Estate \u2014 which owns and manages almost 19 million square feet in New York City \u2014 packed up after college and headed west to work for the California highway department.\n\u201cI had no interest in the family business,\u201d\nGural\ntold the crowd at\nThe Real Deal\u2019\ns Salon Series event Thursday night. \u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those people where their father drove them around and showed them buildings on the weekends. My father was playing golf on the weekends.\u201d His father, Aaron Gural, was chairman of Newmark &amp; Company from 1957 to 1998.\nBut fate \u2014 and his father and his partners \u2014 had other plans. After he moved back to New York and spent a stint working for Morse-Diesel Construction Company, Gural joined the family brokerage business. That would become the foundation for a commercial real estate empire.\nGural, whose passion was\nconstruction\n, started buying old warehouses and turning them into co-ops. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make money, but it was fun,\u201d he said. Then he partnered with Barry Gosin, who brought ambition, flash and a hunger for deals.\n\u201cI had no desire to be particularly wealthy. I thought middle class was good,\u201d Gural said. \u201cBarry was driven.\u201d\nIn the 1980s, they started scooping up B- and C-class buildings across Manhattan in \u201cback-of-the-envelope deals\u201d in forgotten manufacturing blocks that are now the neighborhoods everyone wants to be in. Gural would find the buildings and Gosin would handle the leasing.\n\n\u201cIf I thought a building could make 10 percent in two to four years, I bought it,\u201d he said.\nOver the next four decades and several downturns, Gural grew the landlord and management firm, eventually changing the name to GFP Real Estate to eliminate confusion between the company and its affiliate,\nNewmark Knight Frank\n.\nGural stuck to his thesis of holding onto properties and resisting the urge to sell.\n\u201cI hated selling,\u201d he said. \u201cI look around and who are the richest real estate people in New York? The people who never sell.\u201d\nToday, GFP is converting his most famous asset \u2014 the\nFlatiron Building\n\u2014 into luxury condos that so far start at just below $11 million for a 3,000-square-foot unit, according to an offering plan filed with the Attorney General\u2019s office. A buyer recently signed the first contract at the conversion and the building has two other offers, Gural said.\nGural is also managing partner of the Meadowlands Racetrack and owns a racino and a casino in upstate New York, where he responds to every comment card and is known for his orange Crocs.\n",

        "content": "Tokyu Land US Corporation made a splash in the Lower East Side last week.\nThe firm, the American arm of Japan\u2019s Tokyu Fudosan Holdings Group and a\nco-developer of 425 Park Avenue\n, acquired an 83-unit multifamily building at 10 Rutgers Street from Maurice Kaufman\u2019s AMAC for $56 million, the New York Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal for the 75,000-square-foot property breaks down to $747 per square foot and nearly $675,000 per unit.\nNeither party commented to the outlet on the sale.\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group subsidiary MUFG Bank \u2014 Japan\u2019s largest bank \u2014 provided a $31 million loan for Tokyu Land\u2019s acquisition.\nConstruction on the building was completed in 2018, the same year AMAC acquired the property for $59 million. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any availability at the property, but listed rents this year ranged from $4,560 and $8,500, according to StreetEasy.\n\nLast month, the median rent for a brokered apartment in Manhattan\nwas $4,550\n, down slightly from the previous period, but still up more than 8 percent year-over-year, according to a monthly report from appraiser Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. Elevated mortgage rates have kept would-be buyers in the rental market, helping to pace an all-time record in July, when the median rent in Manhattan stood at $4,700.\nIn November, Tokyu Land teamed up with Robert Morgenstern\u2019s Canvas Investment Partners on the\n$112.8 million acquisition\nof the 150-unit Azure tower at 436 Albee Square in Downtown Brooklyn. Joel Gluck\u2019s Spencer Equity was the seller of the rental building.\nAMAC, meanwhile, owns or manages 71 buildings across 10 states. The developer secured a\n$34 million loan\nfrom Affinius Capital to refinance Main &amp; Mill, an apartment complex delivered two years ago in downtown Lewisville, a suburb northwest of Dallas.\nElsewhere on the Lower East Side, Austin-based MML Hospitality recently purchased the 113-key Nine Orchard hotel at 9 Orchard Street from DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners\nfor $92 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "In a\nrecent edition\nof Daily Dirt, I asked readers to submit bold ideas for large-scale housing development in New York City.\nThe most plausible one came from Ken Fisher, a land-use lawyer at Cozen O\u2019Connor, who recently unveiled it in an\nop-ed\n. His idea expands on a\nrezoning proposal\nby the New York Building Congress to allow housing along the route of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s\nInterborough Express\n.\nFisher, a former City Council member, called for the state agency Empire State Development to use a general project plan instead of separate rezonings. \u201cIn addition to being comprehensive and faster, a GPP could allow revenue sharing with the MTA, which zoning can\u2019t,\u201d Fisher noted.\nHousing along the IBX route will be the subject of a\npanel discussion\nOct. 29.\nSome places\nfund mass transit from private development along train routes, which is what the MTA should have done with the Second Avenue subway. The gist: Transit projects boost property values, so why not\ncapture some of that gain\nto fund the projects? The Bloomberg administration basically did that when it extended the 7 train to Hudson Yards. (H/T Dan Doctoroff.)\nAnother idea came from commercial debt collection attorney Bernard D\u2019Orazio, who suggested, \u201cExtend the 7 train to the Meadowlands and build a big neighborhood in and around the parking lots. People don\u2019t need to live in the city, just close to the city. Ditch the new Port Authority Bus Terminal [plan] and build it in New Jersey on the new subway line.\u201d\nThis is a new take on a Bloomberg administration\nproposal from 2011\n. A study commissioned by the city found trains could go from Secaucus to Grand Central in 16 minutes. But the MTA didn\u2019t want to do it.\nSeveral readers responded that New York state should change the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act to allow more mothballed rent-stabilized units to be renovated and re-rented. That is surely the most cost-effective way to add housing, as I wrote about\nhere\nand\nhere\n, but in this case I was seeking ideas for large-scale development.\nNone of the responses I received was more imaginative \u2014 or impossible \u2014 than this one for southern Brooklyn, from a former New Yorker who moved to California 33 years ago:\n\nIn the UAE, the government built floating islands.\u00a0 Why not do that off Canarsie Pier? Also, there\u2019s an\nactual island\nout there that looks uninhabited.\u00a0 Perhaps build a tunnel under the water, build a subway line through the tunnel, and build a bunch of high-rises on the island with no parking spots.\u00a0 You would need to have a heli-pad on the island for emergencies and a clinic or small hospital on the island for urgent medical care.\nThe reader included this screenshot:\nI try to reply to all readers\u2019 messages, no matter how outlandish, so I sent a polite, six-paragraph response:\nThat is certainly a bold idea, but not a practical one.\nNew York City did have a floating jail in the Bronx, but it has been closed and\nsold as scrap metal\n. Building floating housing would be expensive, especially because we cannot import foreign laborers and\nexploit them\nthe way Abu Dhabi allegedly did. What is possible is extending a land mass by using fill.\nAs for that island off Canarsie Pier, I believe that is\nCanarsie Pol\n. It\u2019s part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, so it is off-limits to housing. It\u2019s made of sand and fill from dredging \u2014 old maps show it was much smaller in 1910 \u2014 and thus would not be conducive to building towers, which need a more solid subsurface for their pilings to be secure.\nBuilding a subway to the island would be\nextraordinarily expensive\n\u2014 at least $10 billion and probably more, which would make the housing uneconomical. The closest subway is the L train, which terminates at\nRockaway Parkway\n, 1.5 miles from Canarsie Pier. It\u2019s above ground. There is no right-of-way to extend it further.\nEven with a subway, the trip to Manhattan would be too far for this land to have much value to commuters. If not for its status as a federal recreation area, you might be able to put summer cottages there, accessible by boat.\nA better island for housing would be Governors Island off Lower Manhattan, but there are restrictions stemming from the island\u2019s transfer from the federal government to the city. So the\ndevelopment plan\nfor Governors Island only includes student and faculty housing.\n",

The duo were the priciest of 25 Manhattan properties asking $4 million or more to find buyers last week, down from 29 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe buyer signed a contract just 16 days after the homes, Nos. 6-8, hit the market. The buyer won a bidding war and agreed to pay above the asking price for the properties, which the buyer plans to convert into one single-family residence. The combined townhouse would stretch 41 feet wide and span 12,600 square feet.\nThe Met has owned the Gilded Age mansions for nearly 50 years. No. 8 also once belonged to George Schaefer, a brewing mogul who purchased it in 1890. The Schaefer family began producing beer in Brooklyn in the 1840s.\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang and Andres Perea-Garzon had the listing.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a condo at JDS Development and Property Markets Group\u2019s\n111 West 57th Street\n. Unit 54 last asked $21 million, down from the just under $27 million the developers sought when the building began\nmarketing off floor plans\nnine years ago.\n\nThe apartment spans 4,200 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park. Amenities in the supertall include a fitness center, pool, terrace and private dining room.\nThe Billionaires\u2019 Row tower has notched\n49 closed sales out of 60 units for an average of $4,500 per square foot. Unit 54 is the 12th condo in the building to land among the top two contracts in weekly reports so far this year.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International\nhad the listing\n.\nOf the 25 properties, 16 were condos, six were co-ops and three were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $217 million, for an average price of $8.7 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home spent more than a year and a half on the market and was discounted 9 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "\nWhen Donald Trump took office this year, he promised ruthless governmental efficiency.\nBut an investor tied to a Chelsea condo project is claiming in a lawsuit filed against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office that it can hardly get an email back.\nThe lawsuit was filed by an\nentity raising EB-5 funds\nfor Legion Investment Group and AVRS Partners\u2019\n83-unit luxury development at 550 West 21st Street\n.\nThe complaint names the USCIS-designated regional center facilitating the EB-5 investment into the project among the defendants. The regional center, which is responsible for sponsoring job-creating projects into which EB-5 investors can participate, filed an I-965F application with USCIS on July 3, which has been pending for over three months, according to the lawsuit.\nThe goal of the project was to raise anywhere from $60 million to $80 million in EB-5 funding, which would be converted into mezzanine debt that would help fully fund the over $320 million project, according to the I-965F application filed in court.\nInvestors seeking to participate in the program, which provides a pathway to citizenship for those investing at least $800,000 in a qualifying project focused in a rural or high-unemployment area, must submit their own petitions to the government along with their financial contributions. The petitions can only be submitted once USCIS approves the I-965F application, which includes documentation showing that the project complies with EB-5 requirements.\nBecause of the delays, it has been a \u201cstruggle to convince investors\u201d that the regional center\u2019s application and investor petitions will be approved when the government has yet to rule on the initial application, \u201cmany months after filing and long after\u201d other projects secured approval, according to the complaint.\nRegional centers have not reported any broad changes in application processing time, according to Aaron Grau, executive director of Invest in the USA, the non-profit trade group for the EB-5 Regional Center Program. \u201cThere could be some unjust delays, but we\u2019re not hearing anything on the macro level,\u201d he said.\nWhat the lawsuit means for the project at 550 West 21st Street is not clear.\n\nThe capital stack was also projected to include $117.5 million in equity and a $155 million construction loan, according to the application. Legion and AVRS just\nclosed on the construction loan last week\nfrom the real estate investing arm of Eldridge Capital Management.\nThe application specified that the EB-5 loan proceeds would be used to fund the costs and expenses of construction, as well as potentially reimburse qualified bridge capital.\nRepresentatives from Legion Investment Group and the EB-5 lender did not respond to a request for comment.\nAfter an email follow-up inquiring on the status of the application on Sept. 26 from an attorney for the regional center, the immigration office responded: \u201cThis case is with an Immigrant Investor Program officer. We appreciate your patience.\u201d\nBut the investor in the West 21st Street project blames the delays on the \u201c[d]efendants\u2019 policy decisions to under-staff the USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office.\u201d No official numbers have been published on staffing cuts at USCIS, and the office did not return a request for comment.\n\u201cUSCIS is probably understaffed to begin with,\u201d Grau said, noting that application times are often context-dependent.\nThe department could be facing changes after Trump in September\nrolled out a \u201cGold Card\u201d visa program\n, in which individuals can pay $1 million to receive U.S. residency. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously told reporters the Gold Card would replace existing employment-based visas, EB-1 and EB-2, that allow foreign nationals with extraordinary or exceptional abilities to seek permanent residency.\nHe added that other visa green card categories will likely be suspended after a trial period, making the Gold Card, and another more expensive and more flexible Platinum Card, the main vehicle for entry into the country.\nTrump first floated the Gold Card\nas a replacement for the EB-5 program in February. Created in 1990 to incentivize foreign investment into job-creating projects, then-President Joe Biden extended the program in 2022 until 2027.\nThe White House\u2019s comments about immigration pathways have been a surprising boon to the EB-5 program, spurring \u201cadditional conversation and interest around EB-5,\u201d said Grau.",

        "content": "Union Investment\u2019s 140 Broadway\nscored another lease from an office tenant looking to switch up its Financial District digs.\nLaw firm Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard &amp; Smith signed a deal for 70,000 square feet at the property, the New York Business Journal\nreported\n. The lease was disclosed in a CBRE report, which noted the lease was the second-largest in Lower Manhattan in the third quarter.\nLewis Brisbois will occupy three floors and house more than 200 lawyers. One of the firm\u2019s partners said the space would help the firm \u201cmeet our ever-increasing demand from new and existing clients,\u201d adding that its proximity to the legal courts was a plus.\nThe asking rent for the lease was not disclosed, but the average asking rent from landlords in the Financial District is $61.99 per square foot, according to Avison Young.\nLewis Brisbois expects to make the move to 140 Broadway next year. It will be leaving 7 World Trade Center, where it had temporarily relocated.\n\nThe law firm previously occupied space at\n77 Water Street, which the Vanbarton Group is converting\ninto residential space. It\u2019s at least the second company to wind its way from 77 Water to 140 Broadway, following in the footsteps of global sustainable development consultancy Arup, which signed a deal for nearly\n100,000 square feet\na few months ago.\nAt the time of Arup\u2019s lease, there was still reportedly 300,000 square feet available at the 51-story, 1.25 million-square-foot property.\nTenants\ntook 9.4 million square feet\nin the third quarter, a 2 percent gain from the second quarter and nearly 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a Colliers report. Leasing volume has already surpassed 30 million square feet for the entire year, surging past pre-pandemic levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "David Iannarone\u2019s securitized debt enforcer isn\u2019t biting on a big suburban Chicago office landlord\u2019s offer to buy a troubled loan note at a hefty discount.\nCWCapital Asset Management\n, the commercial loan special servicer, whose CEO is Iannarone, filed an $87 million foreclosure lawsuit last week in Cook County court against New York-based Group RMC over the\nWestbrook Corporate Center\nin Westchester, escalating a yearlong loan dispute that encapsulates the turmoil gripping Chicago\u2019s suburban office market.\nThe special servicer, acting on behalf of a CMBS trust, has so far rejected Group RMC\u2019s offer to pay $52.5 million in exchange for the loan note tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot complex spread across five buildings, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\nThe offer amounted to $48 per square foot.\nSuch a transaction would amount to a painful discount for the lender but also avoid the costs of further litigation by essentially handing control of the property to Group RMC by\nacknowledging its slide in value\namid the post-pandemic pullback from the office sector.\n\u201cGroup RMC remains committed to the asset, working to ensure its long term success and avoiding foreclosure,\u201d a company spokesperson told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cWe are in active discussions with the lender to reinstate the loan and formulate a plan to stabilize the property.\u201d\nThe lawsuit followed months of default notices and \u201creservation of rights\u201d letters in which CWCapital\u2019s counsel at Troutman Pepper alleged Group RMC missed payments, breached cash management protocols and made other violations of the loan agreement, according to court records reviewed by\nTRD\n.\nEven though the loan doesn\u2019t mature until June 2028, the lender is citing multiple missed payments related to the operation of the property as a reason for accelerating the due dates for the remainder due on the $99 million loan that Group RMC took out on the asset in 2018, when it bought it from Blackstone for $132 million.\nGroup RMC had made repeated efforts to reach a workout before the lawsuit, however, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition to the discounted payoff offer of $52.5 million, the landlord also tried to modify the note and temporarily reduce debt service and sell \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the collateral, such as extra land on the campus, and the lender declined.\nThe proposed modification would have involved a $6 million equity injection from the landlord to create working capital liquidity and lease up vacant space left in the wake of recent tenant departures and downsizing. The lender may still opt into one of the landlord\u2019s proposed workout solutions later on, to resolve the litigation.\nMuch of the vacancy can be attributed to the recent space cutback by Follett Higher Education Group, a major tenant whose lease reduction earlier this year to 45,000 square feet from 128,000 previously triggered a \u201cspecified tenant\u201d default, according to loan and legal documents.\n\nCWCapital began warning of such \u201ctrigger periods\u201d last year, later layering on payment defaults and protective advance reimbursements as the property\u2019s income slipped, the lawsuit shows.\nThe foreclosure filing puts added pressure on Group RMC, which over the past decade amassed a large portfolio of suburban office properties across the U.S. and specifically the Midwest.\nAlthough the company has struggled to make good on loan agreements in the face of declining commercial property values, it has negotiated its way out of multiple financial disputes over its buildings, according to a person familiar with its business dealings.\nSince the pandemic rattled the office market, the firm has put about $70 million into paying off lenders for its properties, using the money to strike extensions of maturity dates, discounted payoffs and other lifelines in a bid to work out its debts, the person said.\nAt least two other Group RMC loans for suburban Chicago assets had landed on lender watchlists as of earlier this year, signaling mounting stress across its portfolio.\nThe firm\u2019s\nExecutive Towers West\ncomplex in Downers Grove \u2014 three buildings totaling 681,000 square feet, also purchased in 2018 from Blackstone \u2014 was flagged after occupancy fell below 80 percent, despite posting a relatively healthy debt-service coverage ratio of about 1.3 last year.\nAnother $40 million loan to Group RMC tied to three properties, including the 427,000-square-foot Oak Creek Center in Lombard, the 118,000-square-foot Oakmont Lane in Westmont and a third in Indianapolis, was also watchlisted after debt coverage slipped just below break-even.\nThe properties are current on payments, suggesting Group RMC is injecting additional cash to cover shortfalls, much as it has tried at Westbrook Corporate Center.\nGroup RMC\u2019s troubles are emblematic of a wider reckoning across suburban Chicago, where office values have plunged and special servicers are increasingly turning to the courts.\nLoan data shows CMBS delinquency rates for suburban office loans climbing to post-pandemic highs this year, with workouts giving way to foreclosures as reserves run dry.\nIf CWCapital proceeds, the lawsuit \u2014 scheduled for its first hearing in April \u2014 could become\none of the largest suburban office foreclosures\never in Cook County, underscoring the market\u2019s harsh new reality: even borrowers willing to put in fresh equity are finding that lenders, too, are out of patience.\n",

        "content": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul wants to bring\none of the Adirondacks\u2019 most storied private estates\ninto public hands, despite the wishes of its late owner.\nThe governor wrote to the trustees of the late John Hendrickson\u2019s estate expressing the state\u2019s interest in buying most of the 36,600-acre Whitney Park, a vast wilderness tract dotted with lakes and forests in Long Lake, the Adirondack Explorer\nreported\n.\nHochul\u2019s Oct. 10 letter also went to Texas-based developer Todd Interests, which signed a deal this spring\nto purchase\nthe property when it was\nlisted\nfor $125 million. In the letter, Hochul said her administration hopes to acquire roughly 32,000 acres to add to the Adirondack Forest Preserve, leaving a smaller portion for private development.\nThe move puts the state in direct conversation with Todd Interests, led by Shawn Todd, which has been weighing conservation options while planning a resort complex on about 4,600 acres. Todd floated concepts ranging from a golf-and-ski destination to a high-end residential subdivision, but he also acknowledged discussions with the Department of Environmental Conservation about a large conservation easement.\nA potential sale to the state is complicated by claims that Hendrickson was opposed to such a transaction. Before his death last year, Hendrickson \u2014 widower of philanthropist Marylou Whitney \u2014 publicly opposed state acquisition, blaming the loss of native trout on earlier state management of part of the property.\n\nTodd says he has yet to see any binding deed restriction, though the trustees have refused to discuss terms.\nEnvironmental advocates are urging Hochul to push for outright purchase rather than limited easements. Claudia Braymer of Protect the Adirondacks argued that anything short of full state ownership \u201cwould fall far short of the public\u2019s long-standing expectation\u201d for permanent protection.\nWhitney Park, on the state\u2019s conservation wish list since 1992,\nencompasses 22 lakes and more than 100 miles of untouched shoreline\n. The state\u2019s push could tap funds from the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act or the $425 million Environmental Protection Fund, according to Braymer.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is being marketed by brokers Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman. The asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe listing comes as a growing number of downtown landlords move to cash in on strong rent growth and tightening supply. Several high-end buildings recently hit the market, part of a wider thaw in Chicago multifamily investment as interest rates stabilize and investor appetite rebounds.\nFulton Market, one of the city\u2019s priciest rental districts, has been a magnet for recent trades. Chicago-based Waterton paid nearly $90 million for a 14-story property at\n180 North Ada Street\n, while a New York investor shelled out $170 million for the Fulbrix Apartments at\n160 North Elizabeth Street\n.\n\nAn LG venture landed a $94.2 million construction loan for Arthur on Aberdeen in 2022, Cook County records show. The property includes about 10,000 square feet of fully leased retail space.\nLG CEO Brian Goldberg\nsaid the building could draw strong interest from buyers seeking value relative to coastal markets. Apartment rents in the Fulton Market neighborhood start at about $1,900 a month.\n\u201cInvestors are seeing a disconnect in pricing between Chicago and metros like L.A., Nashville or Florida,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a discount here, but also more upside because of limited supply.\nDowntown\u2019s top-tier apartment rents have surged\n6.4 percent year-over-year\nas of the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources, which might point to why developers like LG are looking to sell into momentum.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

They will work alongside managing broker Veronica Zorzi and agent Diema Diaz, the release shows. They will be working in a temporary office at suite 350 at 515 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach, Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Florida CEO Peter Giese confirmed.\nTo Giese, the expansion is an obvious next step.\n\u201cSince Covid, Palm Beach County has been our most profitable [market],\u201d he said. Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers already has offices in Jupiter, Wellington, Boca Raton and Delray Beach. Giese said he saw West Palm Beach as a gap in their coverage for luxury clients.\n\nOliveros is the former director and chairman of the board of Activo Bank in Puerto Rico, now known as TBB International Bank. TBB is suing Oliveros in the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico, alleging he orchestrated a fraud scheme that cost the bank more than $29 million, court filings show. The suit was filed in 2023 and litigation is ongoing. Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nUrdaneta joins the brokerage from eXp Realty, where he was an agent in Boca Raton for three years, according to his LinkedIn. He is also a yacht broker with interglobal Yacht Sales, and advises foreign business owners on starting businesses in the U.S. He markets himself as an adviser to Latin American investors and families, according to LinkedIn.\nTogether, they will head an office in a market with growing competition. A number of brokerages and teams have expanded to Palm Beach and West Palm Beach in recent years, including\nSerhant\nand\nCervera Real Estate\n.\nEngel &amp; V\u00f6lkers\u2019 growth efforts extend beyond Palm Beach County. In June, the firm announced\nnew offices\nin Miami\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood and its plans to reopen in Coconut Grove. Last year, it opened in\nPompano Beach\n. Giese said following the Compass-Anywhere Real Estate merger news, it was a good time to be a growing boutique brokerage.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had individuals really engage with us more,\u201d he said of agent recruitment efforts. \u201cPeople are talking about boutique being popular, and we\u2019re already there.\u201d",

The company is searching near its headquarters in Palo Alto but is also reportedly looking farther south, as far as Santa Clara.\n\nNeuralink, known for its brain-computer interface designed to help people with paralysis control devices using their thoughts, is valued at more than $3 billion. The company began human trials last year with 12 patients around the world reportedly now using its implant technology.

Commissioner Darrell Herbert called the tower \u201cout of scale and out of step\u201d with the area\u2019s historic character.\nCity staff had recommended approving a scaled-back rezoning allowing up to five stories, far less than the requested 25.\nAdebayo\u2019s team said they were willing to lower the height to 15 stories and pointed to a nearby 13-story\napartment building\nas precedent. Even so, opponents argued that Winners Tower \u2014 at its size and price point \u2014 risked symbolizing\ngentrification\nmore than growth.\nThe project\u2019s estimated cost, about $250 million, was expected to be funded in part from EB-5 visa investors affiliated with the Okpa Company, a Dallas real estate and consulting firm led by commercial appraiser and prior Dallas mayoral candidate Edward Okpa.\nAdebayo has assembled land for the effort since 2007 and said several tenants and retailers had expressed interest.\nWhile Thursday\u2019s denial marked a serious setback, the developer can still appeal to the City Council, but overturning the commission\u2019s vote would require a three-fourths supermajority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The relocation will allow Scale to more than double its in-office headcount in Manhattan.\nThe asking rent for the space on the 74th and 75th floors of the building was $65 per square foot and the sublease runs until the beginning of 2030. CBRE\u2019s Eddie Sisca and David Opper represented the subtenant, while Savills\u2019 Scott Bogetti and Will Joumas and CBRE\u2019s David Hollander represented the sublandlord.\nNone of the numerous parties involved in the sublease or the building commented to the outlet on the deal.\n\nThe building co-owners are The Durst Organization and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The building spans 3.1 million square feet and more than 100 stories.\nIn May, Durst made the 89th and 90th floors\navailable to lease\n, the first time they\u2019re being marketed to office tenants. The landlord is looking to capitalize on the sky-high floors and score rents in the ballpark of $160 per square foot.\nThe Bank of New York last month agreed to\nsublease 192,000 square feet\nfrom media giant Conde Nast. The bank plans to occupy the four floors for four years while it renovates its headquarters at 240 Greenwich Avenue.\nA year ago, Scale agreed to sublease\nbetween 170,000 and 180,000 square feet\nat 650 Townsend Street in San Francisco, one of the larger leases of the year in the Bay Area.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The owner of 4231 North 58th Avenue is 58 Oak, LLC, led by\nAri Pearl\nof PPG Development, and Reuven Rogatinsky.\nThe rest of the site, at 4220 North 58th Avenue, is owned by 4220 N 58th Avenue Partners, LLC, led by Fort Lauderdale attorney Samuel Rogatinsky.\n\nKushner plans to build an eight-story multifamily building and a seven-story parking garage with 786 spaces on the west side of the street, and a 4,000-square-foot synagogue and 9,300-square-foot clubhouse on the east side.\nThe multifamily building would have 80 studios, 132 one-bedroom units, 122 one-bedroom units with a den, 52 two-bedroom units, 76 two-bedroom units with a den and eight three-bedroom units.\nKushner also plans to renovate the historic Bryan House, a vacant structure on the west side of 58th Avenue and convert it to a private residential library on a courtyard enclosed by the multifamily building. John Milton Bryan Jr. and his wife, Guilda Rose Bryan, built the house in the early 1900s on a remnant of an orange grove they owned. Hollywood designated the house as a local historic site in 1999.\nThe\nHollywood\nCity Commission rezoned the development site from \u201cnorth mixed use\u201d (N-MU) to \u201cplanned development\u201d (PD) and approved a partial demolition of Bryan House to remove a portion of the structure that was not part of the original construction.\nKushner has been very active in South Florida. In May, the company scored a $115 million construction loan and broke ground on a three-story, 68-unit\nluxury apartment building\nin Surfside. Kushner also has developments in Miami Gardens, in Miami\u2019s Wynwood and Edgewater neighborhoods, and in Fort Lauderdale. In December, the company\npaid $190 million\nfor the 28-story, 276-unit Hamilton apartment tower in Edgewater.",

        "content": "A sprawling Hudson Valley farm that took more than four decades to piece together has hit the market for $90 million, a price that would shatter sales records across Columbia and Dutchess counties.\nMill Farm, in the hamlet of Ancramdale, spans roughly 2,150 acres of contiguous land surrounded by conservation areas, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. Compass agent James Augustine, who\nco-listed\nthe property with Byron Anderson, said such a large, unbroken tract is extremely rare for the region.\nThe listing price breaks down to nearly $42,000 per acre.\nOwner Daniel Slott, a former Bear Stearns banker who later ran a junk-bond fund, spent 43 years quietly buying up 29 parcels to create the massive compound. Slott began the assemblage in 1982 with a $250,000 purchase of 160 acres. Over the years, as Columbia County farmland languished and dairy operations shuttered, he expanded his holdings at discounted prices ranging from $250 to $20,000 an acre.\nAt the heart of Mill Farm is a converted 18th-century grist mill. Slott spent a decade transforming the roughly 5,500-square-foot structure \u2014 known as the Mill House \u2014 into a four-bedroom residence overlooking a waterfall that still generates a trickle of hydropower.\n\nThe property also includes nine other homes, 15 barns (some historic, others relocated or rebuilt), miles of gravel roads and a 2.5-mile stretch of former New York Central Railroad track used as a horse gallop.\nSlott, who once kept 30 Icelandic horses on the farm, moved to the property full-time around 2000. The estate has roughly 18 miles of private roads and three miles of Punch Brook Stream running through it and a windmill system supplying water across the acreage.\nSlott said he hopes the next owner keeps the property intact and plans to spend more time in Iceland, home to the horses that first inspired the farm.\nIf it trades anywhere near its asking price, the sale would eclipse the area\u2019s previous high mark,\nan $18.5 million, 290-acre sale\nin Dutchess County in 2022. While neighboring properties list for a fraction of that sum, Augustine said Columbia County\u2019s luxury market has surged as New Yorkers seek land and low density.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The purchase is Publix\u2019s latest acquisition in a buying spree that began last year.\nPublix paid $347 a square foot for Hammocks Town Center, which is in\nKendall\n, an unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade County. The deal did not include five outparcels owned by other entities, including Bank of America, Extra Space Storage, McDonald\u2019s, 7-11 and Kendall Ice Arena, records show.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Jacksonville-based Regency Centers Corporation, led by CEO Lisa Palmer, sold Hammocks Town Center for nearly $54 million above the previous sale price 26 years ago.\n\nIn 1999, Regency Centers paid $18 million for the 26.3-acre site, records show. The shopping center was completed in 1987. Hammocks Town Center\u2019s tenant roster includes West Kendall Regional Library, CVS, Dollar Tree, YouFit and Subway.\nIncluding Hammocks Town Center, Publix has dropped a combined $344.9 million for a standalone store and seven South Florida shopping centers anchored by its supermarkets since May of last year.\nIn March, the grocer acquired a Publix store and an outparcel building leased to Starbucks in Fort Lauderdale for\n$25 million\n. The property is adjacent to the\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\nmall that was recently sold to a partnership led by Miami-based developer Russell Galbut.\nIn January, Publix paid\n$40.8 million\nfor a North Miami strip mall and two outparcels on 11.8 acres. In addition to being anchored by a Publix supermarket, the property\u2019s tenants include McDonald\u2019s, Elevation Fitness, Wells Fargo Bank, GNC and GoPet Hospital.\nLast year, Publix acquired five shopping centers anchored by its stores in\nCoral Springs\n, Davie, Lake Worth Beach and\nRoyal Palm Beach\nfor a combined $208.5 million.",

        "content": "A Powerball winner is using his winnings to help rebuild his hometown of Altadena.\nEdwin Castro, who bought a record $2 billion Powerball lottery ticket at a gas station in 2022, is one of the biggest buyers of lots in Altadena after January\u2019s deadly Eaton fire, The Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The 33-year-old has spent $10 million to buy up 15 lots so far.\nMany\nAltadena\nresidents have grown fearful of a neighborhood takeover by wealthy investors as many struggle to get back on their feet. A petition to stop investors from buying Altadena lots, for example, has collected almost 1,500 signatures.\nCastro hopes to act as a benevolent force in the community in which he grew up.\n\u201cThis is for a family that wants to move in,\u201d Castro told the Journal while looking at burned lots. \u201cThose are the people that need to be looked out for right now.\u201d\nCastro is focused on rebuilding single-family homes for local families\nrather than developers\nor landlords. The lottery winner has already submitted plans for his first two houses, which would be Craftsman-style designs with an\naccessory dwelling unit\nattached. He expects to break ground once county permits are cleared; his plans for a broader reconstruction could take a decade.\nCastro isn\u2019t looking to make out like a bandit.\n\u201cThe profit margin doesn\u2019t need to be egregious,\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cBut I\u2019m not building these homes just to give them away.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people who were affected by the fires in Altadena cannot or do not want to rebuild and aspire to move on and start elsewhere,\u201d Edwin Castro and his brother Jesse, with whom he runs\nBlack Lion Properties\n,\nsaid\nin a statement. \u201cThese purchases will help some of them, while keeping ownership of the property local.\u201d\nCastro himself\nbought a $25.5 million estate\nin the Hollywood Hills in 2023.\nSome locals, such as\nAltadena\nnative Joel Bryant, are happy to see Castro stepping in while other investors circle the neighborhood. \u201cI feel better about him than anybody else because he\u2019s from the area,\u201d Bryant said.\nOther residents, however, aren\u2019t as convinced.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just another person trying to get some profit,\u201d Seriina Covarrubias, whose home suffered severe smoke damage but was still standing after the fires, said.\nUltimately, Castro hopes to restore as much of the Altadena he knew and loved as possible. \u201cI want it to feel like the old neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cLike if you put all those houses pre-fire in a time bubble.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The sale of the complex, which is about 20 miles southwest of Chicago, comes out to about $110,000 per unit.\nWaterton had held onto the apartments for over 20 years. The firm bought the property in 2003, and it was built in 1987.\nRent for the units in the three-story apartment community range from about $1,100 to $1,600 per month. Turner specializes in workforce housing investments, according to its website. The company\u2019s Multifamily Impact Fund was established specifically to buy and preserve naturally occurring affordable housing.\nRepresentatives of Waterton and Turner did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe sale took place off market, CBRE broker John Jaeger said, and it\u2019s part of a flurry of activity coming from Waterton.\n\nWaterton has been active in Chicago\u2019s multifamily market as interest picks up from local and out-of-state buyers. Suburban Chicago has been ranked one of the most active multifamily markets in the country consistently this year as supply dries up and demand in Sun Belt cities decreases.\n\u201cHousing prices are very high, so people are renting for longer. And there\u2019s really not a lot of new product to choose from,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting some great interest in our suburban assets.\u201d\nLast month, Waterton dropped $90 million to buy a 263-unit building known as the Mason in buzzy Fulton Market. The price came out to about $342,000 per unit. Over the summer, it spent $320,000 per unit with the $167 million purchase of a 522-unit property in the Los Angeles area.\nIn Chicago\u2019s Buena Park neighborhood, the company is looking to offload the Montrose Apartments, which the firm has owned since 2015.\nWaterton purchased the 18-story, 287-unit building for $65 million, with a $61 million mortgage from JPMorgan. The deal came out to $226,000 per unit.\nEarlier this year Waterton also listed the 346-unit Grand Central apartments in the South Loop for sale, two years after acquiring it for $81.9 million, or $237,000 per unit.",

The previous record was set in January with the $30 million\nsale of 260 Sea Cliff Avenue\nin Sea Cliff by the Shorenstein family.\nThe seller of the\nPacific Heights property\nwas the estate of\nBrooks Walker Jr.\n, a longtime business and civic leader in the Bay Area who died last year at 96. The property had been in the family for about 60 years.\nThe buyer was listed as HOS Pacific LLC, a California company with ties to Texas, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The\nSan Francisco Standard\n, meanwhile, reported that the LLC is connected to Joseph O\u2019Neill, a Texas oil executive and friend of former President George W. Bush.\nIt\u2019s the second major transaction on Broadway in the past week. The\nsale of 2898 Broadway\na block away is now in contract after listing for $26 million. The seller was Jim Willenborg, managing partner at local investment firm Baker Street Partners; the mansion was originally listed at $32 million in 2023.\nSan Francisco\u2019s luxury market is red-hot, and the latest record-setting sale is an indicator of just how in-demand high-end homes are. As artificial intelligence grows and tech workers flock to the city, it\u2019s become increasingly difficult for luxury buyers to find properties, leading to an apparent\nmansion shortage.\n\nSales of homes in San Francisco that were priced above $5 million were up 55 percent last month compared to the previous September. Total home sales were up 35 percent year-over-year.\nDespite the $42 million price tag, the 2930 Broadway sale doesn\u2019t touch the all-time record for home prices in San Francisco. That record belongs to Laurene Powell Jobs, who bought a mansion down the street at 2840 Broadway last year for $71 million.\nOutside the city, the biggest transaction of the year in the Bay Area was the\nsale of the 74-acre Green Gables estate\nlast month for $85 million. That price was a sizable haircut from its original listing at $135 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It was the third-lowest share among major metros across the United States behind New York and Newark, New Jersey.\nThe Bay Area\u2019s housing market tells diverging stories. Home values in the region have dipped, but many sellers aren\u2019t budging, betting on a market rebound driven by the\nartificial intelligence boom\nand an influx of interested buyers to the Bay Area.\nSellers who do cut prices in San Francisco usually shave off about 6 percent or $100,000. Two-thirds of single-family homes ended up selling above list price in August, the highest rate in the region.\nThe $42 million\nhome sale in Pacific Heights\nmarked the priciest deal in the city so far this year, showing no signs of a market downturn,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\n\nDown south in San Jose, however, sellers are experiencing the opposite effect. Those looking for buyers in the San Jose metro area, made up of Santa Clara and San Benito Counties, cut prices slightly more often than the national average, signaling a cooldown in one of the country\u2019s priciest markets.\nNearly one in five homes for sale this summer in the San Francisco metro area, defined as San Francisco and San Mateo Counties, were at risk of selling for less than they were purchased, the highest rate of any region in the U.S.,\naccording\nto Redfin.\nYear-over-year, typical home values in San Francisco and San Mateo Counties were flat. San Francisco\u2019s median home price was more than $1.2 million, or $100,000 below pre-pandemic levels. With\nAI gobbling up office\n\u2014\nand now, residential\n\u2014 space, San Francisco home sellers are sticking with their list prices.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 150,000-square-foot lease was the market\u2019s biggest absorption in the third quarter.\nFrazer announced the move last year and shared plans to invest $4 million updating and expanding the building, which was built in 2001.

West Loop and the\nEnergy Corridor\ntopped the list; both logged more than 200,000 square feet of positive absorption.\nSince the pandemic, Houston\u2019s office market has been on a\nslow path to recovery\n, but market indicators are improving, according to Colliers.\n\nThe city\u2019s overall vacancy rate dropped from 27.9 percent a year ago to 27.4 percent. In the third quarter last year, the market saw\n23,700 square feet of negative absorption\n. This year, 555,000 square feet was absorbed in July through September, marking the second quarter in a row that more space was leased than vacated, marking the first sustained positive absorption since 2019, Colliers said.\nLIke other cities around the country, the flight-to-quality office trend dominates the Houston market.\nThe average vacancy of buildings constructed since 2015 is 11.9 percent, pointing to companies\u2019 preference for new office space with top-of-the-line amenities.\nFor example, Skanska delivered Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a 386,000-square-foot office building at 1550 Lamar Street, last year. The 28-story building is 62 percent leased, with\nThird Coast Infrastructure\nbeing the latest company to sign a deal to move into the trophy building.\n",

        "content": "Senate Bill 79\n, the landmark legislation allowing for transit-oriented upzoning across the state, is now officially on the law books. But\nnot all officials are happy\n.\nDespite Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature of the bill last week, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass isn\u2019t thrilled about the mandate coming down from Sacramento, The Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\n\u201cThe rigid timelines and limited flexibility for alternative plans set forth in SB 79 create unnecessary burdens for Los Angeles communities,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhile I support the legislation\u2019s intent to accelerate housing development statewide, the bill as written diminishes neighborhood input on planning and zoning.\u201d\nBass\nwas joined in dissent\nby Los Angeles Councilwoman Traci Park, who last month said that SB 79 \u201copens the floodgates to developers, displacement and gentrification.\u201d The new law allows for the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile.\nPark said the legislation would allow multi-story residential buildings to rise \u201cwith no regard for impacts on traffic, infrastructure, the environment, evacuation routes, public safety, quality of life or community character.\u201d\nBefore passing the California legislature, lawmakers shaved down the proposal\u2019s reach significantly. Only eight of California\u2019s 58 counties are eligible for SB 79-related upzoning, with efforts focused in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nContra Costa County barely escaped enforcement\nthanks to specific language in the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s not just local politicians who are upset or nervous about how it will all play out, either.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. One-size-fits-all does not work,\u201d Annette Mercer, a longtime resident of West Los Angeles\u2019 Rancho Park, told the Journal. \u201cHowever, maintaining single-family homes forever when we have a homeless issue doesn\u2019t work either.\u201d\nThe\npush and pull between local and state governments\nis nothing new, though Newsom\u2019s signing of SB 79 is the latest instance of local control over zoning and construction being lost to state mandates. As California works to meet its housing crisis, Newsom and other officials, such as SB 79 author Scott Wiener, have been working to increase building and cut red tape wherever possible.\nIn July, for example, Newsom\nsigned a landmark rollback of the California Environmental Quality Act\n. Environmental reviews under CEQA for many projects would gum up the approval process, but now developers for most infill projects in the state will be able to bypass such approvals.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The developer paid more than $55 million for the land and secured $150 million in construction financing before construction in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are pursuing all opportunities with this development, including lease or sale, offering flexibility for potential users who plan to be in the Chicago market for the long term,\u201d a Logistics Property spokesperson told the outlet.\nThe company has previously said the facility could support 600 to 800 permanent jobs.

The only holdout is the Cinemark Theater, which is open and untouched by the wrecking crews.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a blank slate for the nearly 70 acres in the center of West Dundee, and we\u2019re excited about what the future may bring for that acreage,\u201d Village Manager Joe Cavallaro told the outlet.\nChicago-based planning firm\nHouseal Lavigne\nis expected to deliver conceptual designs by year\u2019s end to guide redevelopment of the mall property, which opened in 1980 and shuttered in March 2024. Village President\nChris Nelson\nsaid the municipality plans to start marketing the site early next year with an eye toward a mixed-use plan blending housing, retail and entertainment.\nA recent feasibility study suggests the area within the mall\u2019s ring road \u2014 plus 32 adjacent acres \u2014 could support 1,500 residential units and 325,000 square feet of commercial development.\nWest Dundee began acquiring portions of the dead mall in 2023, buying the former Sears and Macy\u2019s stores for $2 million and $1.25 million, respectively. Last year, the village paid another $7 million to purchase the mall\u2019s core, including the old Carson Pirie Scott store, after New York-based\nKohan Retail Investment\nagreed to sell off its remaining stake in the\nmall\n.\n\nOfficials said public ownership was the only way to pave the path for a full-scale redevelopment.\nAbout 20 percent of the property, including the former Carson\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s sites, sits within neighboring\nCarpentersville\n. Earlier this year, Carpentersville agreed to buy the Kohl\u2019s building for $2 million, giving it control over the site\u2019s future. West Dundee will oversee most of the redevelopment, but Carpentersville will retain final approval on its portion.\nDemolition, originally expected to cost $3.8 million and run through November, is finishing ahead of schedule \u2014 a milestone Nelson said \u201csets the table for a complete revamp rather than trying to reuse old buildings that were not necessarily useful in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\nCavallaro added that legal and logistical \u201cspaghetti,\u201d including access covenants, still need to be sorted out before redevelopment can begin.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A sprawling Houston estate modeled after a European castle is back on the market at a\nprice\npoint more familiar to coastal buyers.\nThe 22,000-square-foot home dubbed the Lodge at Hunters Creek, at 107 Timberwilde Lane, relisted for $59.9 million \u2014 or about $2,723 per square foot, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s the most-expensive publicly listed home price in Texas, according to the\nHouston Association of Realtors\n. The 9-acre property overlooking Buffalo Bayou is now represented by Coldwell Banker\u2019s Carol Wolfe, who took it over from the previous agent and raised the price by $10 million from its ask last year.\nThe mansion has appeared on and off the MLS for years, but Wolfe is betting that Houston\u2019s expanding pool of high-net-worth buyers will see value in what she calls a \u201cfortress-level\u201d property with craftsmanship and materials comparable to estates in Beverly Hills or Palm Beach.\n\u201cEstates of this scale and pedigree often command $80 million to $100 million in other markets,\u201d Wolfe told the outlet, adding that Houston\u2019s luxury homes are undervalued by national standards.\nThe property listed in 2022 for\n$60 million\nand increased to\n$65 million\nfor a few months the following year before dropping to\n$49.9 million\n, where it stayed for a year before the listing was removed in November, according to its\nRedfin\nlisting history.\n\nThe estate took six years to construct and was completed in 2005. It includes a 3,500 square-foot guest home as well as staff quarters.\nBuilt by seller Colleen Romanov, the estate channels Richardson Romanesque design with limestone from the same Indiana quarry used for the Empire State Building and the Pentagon. The home blends old-world architecture with discreet modern technology \u2014 such as carved mahogany woodwork, hidden doors and a two-story library accented by iron detailing, situated alongside concealed televisions and sound systems.\nThe estate has manicured gardens, a pool house and a guesthouse designed in Texas Hill Country style, all tucked behind gates in the affluent Memorial Villages enclave.\nWolfe compared the listing to the most-expensive house ever sold in Houston, at 120 Carnarvon, a 27,000-square-foot mansion that sold for more than $21 million in\n2022\n, or about $778 per square foot. The Romanov estate is asking almost triple that, and a sale anywhere near that would turn heads in the national ultra-luxury market.\nSales of homes priced above $10 million in Houston surged 75 percent year-over-year in 2023, according to Compass, and the number of millionaires living in the city has jumped 75 percent in the past decade, to roughly 82,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a long year for the Brooklyn Mirage.\nThe East Williamsburg live music venue may be starting down a new path after the building\u2019s owner has filed for a demolition permit for at least some of the venue, part of a bigger space called Avant Gardner.\nA demolition would cap a tumultuous series of months \u2014 ones that included canceled shows, bankruptcy filings and overrun renovation costs.\nThe application is for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet. The overall complex is roughly 80,000 square feet and estimated cost is $1.5 million, according to the permit application. Avant Gardner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTroubles for the Brooklyn Mirage and Avant Gardner started in 2023, after two separate incidents of patrons being found dead after attending the venue. (The venue said the deaths were tragic but denied responsibility.)\nBut the party kept going until earlier this year, when the venue closed for a slate of renovations. The company set a May 1 opening date and booked a summer full of shows.\nInstead the venue was silent. The venue failed to meet its inspection deadline and the buildings department yanked its temporary occupancy certificate, Brooklyn Paper\nreported\n.\n\nAlthough the Mirage applied for the permit every year, the buildings department told Brooklyn Paper the latest edition of the venue not only didn\u2019t meet permitting guidelines, it was flat out unsafe.\n\u201cDOB had numerous objections to the performance space, both safety related and technical in nature, that prevented the project from being code-compliant and safe enough to open for the public,\u201d a DOB spokesperson told Brooklyn Paper. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a question of red tape, but rather a list of legitimate issues with the constructed space.\u201d\nAvant Gardner fired its CEO and replaced him with Gary Richards, who is also known by his DJ alias Destructo. Adding to the drama,\nBKMag\npublished the eyewitness account of an eavesdropper who overheard Richards telling his dinner companion at French restaurant Per Se that the company was struggling to find a buyer.\nAvant Gardner\u2019s parent company filed for bankruptcy in early August. It reported\n$153.3 million in funded debt obligations\n, according to Bloomberg.\nRichards blamed the financial troubles on the loss of the Mirage and aggressive lenders, with some advancing the company $20 million to stay afloat, according to Bloomberg. The company said it was working with the buildings department on a remediation plan.\nMost recently, Avant Gardner has proposed a settlement with creditors, Law360\nreported\n. An affiliate of the company\u2019s lender is slated to purchase the venue\u2019s assets after no other qualified bids were received, according to bankruptcy documents.\nA hearing to approve the sale is scheduled for Oct. 22.\n",

        "content": "CMBS issuance in New York could reach $121 billion this year, its highest level since 2007, with office deals\nhelping lead the resurgence\n, according to\ndata\nfrom Trepp and Commercial Real Estate Direct.\nSeven of the 20 largest single-asset-single borrower CMBS deals so far this year have included office collateral, according to Trepp. New York represented the largest CMBS office deal of the year.\nTishman Speyer secured a $2.65 billion CMBS loan for the Spiral\n, a 66-story high-end office building in Hudson Yards.\nLonnie Hendry, chief product officer for Trepp, said CMBS is the \u201cperfect marketplace\u201d for the billion-dollar-plus deals.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen some very large deals in that single asset, single borrower cohort in the office sector of New York, where they were able just to do it all in one fell swoop, instead of having to compete with multiple different lenders,\u201d said Hendry in an interview last month.\nCMBS has long been New York City office developers\u2019 preferred method to refinance office loans. The financing mechanism, which bundles loans together and sells them to investors, usually offers the cheapest source of financing.\nDemand for CMBS financing fell off in 2008 when the property markets crashed during the Financial Crisis. But the market rebounded in the following years thanks to a renewed interest in commercial real estate.\nCMBS issuance fell to just $55 billion in 2020\n, only for it to nearly double the following year to $109 billion.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve started to increase rates in 2022, spreads on CMBS loans jumped and issuance declined. But spreads, or the perceived risk of CMBS loans, recently decreased to around 80 basis points as the Federal Reserve moved to cut the Federal Funds rate a quarter of a percentage point.\nCMBS office deals are for sure becoming more palatable to investors.\nBut most of the new issuance is concentrated in single-asset, single-borrower loans, instead of conduit loans, according to Trepp. This shows that investors are being highly selective and not taking bets on the asset class, but rather on a single office building.\nMuch has been made about the\nresurgence of the city\u2019s office market\nand institutional investors\u2019 return to the asset class. But a closer look shows investment is mostly concentrated in hyper-local\nsubmarkets such as Grand Central\n.\nCMBS is exhibiting a similar trend. Investment is increasing, but only in select parts of the market.\nAt the same time, distress is continuing to play out, and CMBS delinquency rates remain at record levels. In August, CMBS office loans had a remarkable 11.66 percent delinquency rate before notching 11.13 percent in September, according to Trepp, which tracks securitized mortgages.\n",

The firms have previously partnered on several projects, including two\nGowanus developments\nand a $370 million mixed-use multi-family project\nin Long Island City.\nThe firms declined to disclose the acquisition price.\nDomain co-founders and co-CEOs Matt Schwartz and Chris Papamichael will continue to lead the company. Vorea\u2019s founder, Peter Papamichael \u2014 cousin to Domain\u2019s Papamichael \u2014 will join as executive managing director, overseeing development acquisitions and business development, the firm announced.\nDomain will acquire Vorea\u2019s development arm, its commercial brokerage, and its general contracting business. Vorea\u2019s existing assets are not included in the deal and will become part of Peter Papamichael\u2019s family office.\n\nThe move comes as construction and financing costs continue to pressure margins citywide. By pulling Vorea\u2019s construction and leasing teams in-house, Domain will control more of its supply chain, a strategy that\u2019s become increasingly common among New York developers trying to keep projects on budget and on schedule.\nVorea, founded in 2009, developed mixed-use and residential projects in the outer boroughs while expanding into general contracting and commercial leasing, expertise Domain will use to help scale its growing New York City pipeline.\nThat pipeline includes roughly $2 billion in upcoming projects, such as the next phase of Greenpoint Landing, a 1,000-unit development set to break ground in 2026. The firm is also planning a 400-unit residential project across two towers in Astoria,\nCrain\u2019s reported\n.\nMeanwhile, Domain has major holdings in New Orleans and Salt Lake City, where it\u2019s expanded into hospitality, office and life sciences.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that landlords have not been happy about\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rent\nin nearly half of New York City apartments.\nBut with the election just weeks away and a Mamdani mayoralty looking more likely than ever, some rent-stabilized players have shifted their focus. If a rent freeze is a near certainty, they ask, what else can be done to mitigate\ngrowing distress in rent-stabilized portfolios\n? Policies that tamp down on landlords\u2019 expenses have the potential to ease distress and also win support from a tenant-focused administration.\n\u201cWith Mamdani, it\u2019s not in his political interests for buildings to fall apart,\u201d said Ben Carlos Thypin, CEO of the real estate brokerage Quantierra. \u201cThe dynamics are such that the likelihood of change seems higher than it was before.\u201d\nRafael Cestero, CEO at Community Preservation Corp, said he has been watching distress grow in even the most conservative portfolios. The nonprofit lender has seen foreclosures in rent-stabilized buildings with little debt and fixed-rate mortgages\nincrease eightfold\nin the past two years.\nMuch of that is due to eye-popping expense increases, such as a\n52 percent increase in insurance costs over five years\n.\nPolicies to address that side of the equation could help, according to Cestero. A public property insurance option, such as what the federal government offers homeowners in flood-prone areas, could bring down prices. An as-of-right tax abatement for rent-stabilized buildings could also help property owners who pay city taxes.\nPolicies like that could make a significant impact on curbing distress in rent-stabilized buildings, an issue some policy experts fear could slowly make buildings uninhabitable due to deferred maintenance.\n\u201cPolitics and campaigns are done in poetry. And then governance is done in prose,\u201d Cestero said. \u201cThe assemblymember, should he be the mayor, has shown over the last few weeks that he understands that governance is different from campaigning.\u201d\nMamdani has begun talking about some of those policy adjustments. He\ntold the audience\nat Crain\u2019s mayoral forum this month that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d\nsupports comprehensive property tax reform\n. And a rent freeze does not preclude policies to lower insurance or energy costs, he said.\n\u201cThe impetus here is to provide relief to a disproportionately working- and middle-class set of New Yorkers,\u201d said Mamdani. \u201cIt is not, however, to punish the landlords of those units.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for rent-stabilized landlords have taken note of Mamdani\u2019s change in tone.\n\u201cCertainly conversations seem to have shifted,\u201d said Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association. \u201cTime will tell what the results of this will be, but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d\nTo be sure, those policies are likely expensive. Property tax reform would be a major political lift, and one that former mayors have failed to execute on. And policies often need to be carefully designed. Some of the city\u2019s other attempts to help out rent-stabilized property owners have made no impact. For example, a program to reimburse landlords for renovations of vacant units has gone completely unused, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nEven with these expense-side tweaks, costs could still overtake revenue, Cestero said. A politically viable solution on the revenue side, he said, may be to peg allowable rent increases to inflation and other indexes, as California does.\nBut a focus on compromise could win Mamdani some tacit support in the real estate industry.\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely a solution there that makes everybody happy,\u201d said Peter Hungerford, an investor in rent-stabilized properties. \u201cIf Mamdani can deliver on that, he\u2019s going to earn my vote for re-election.\u201d\nHungerford and his business partners are making a bet that they can buy rent-stabilized buildings at fire sale prices and hold onto them until a change in circumstances raises their value. Other rent-stabilized investors, typically low-profile New York landlords, are making that same wager.\nFor those investors, a rent freeze may not make a real difference to their bottom line, but they still welcome help on the expense side.\n\u201cIf things get worse in the meantime, because there is no compromise, that scenario doesn\u2019t scare us as investors,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cBut it absolutely scares me as a New Yorker.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In the final months of the Adams administration, these rezonings are heading to the finish line.\nThe rezoning of some 230 blocks in Jamaica, Queens, is slated for a final City Council vote this month. Last week, the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises and the Committee on Land Use approved the rezoning with a few changes.\nThose changes shaved 490 units off the city\u2019s housing projections for the rezoning. Instead of 12,300 units, the rezoning is expected to pave the way for roughly 11,800 units.\nThe modifications included reducing the density allowed in areas south of downtown Jamaica, as well as removing \u201climited portions\u201d of certain districts along the southern corridor from the rezoning.\nThe changes, explained Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the zoning subcommittee, are aimed at creating a transition from the higher densities downtown to the residential areas to the south, \u201cwhere there are blocks of occupied homes and less access to transit.\u201d\nThe Adams administration also committed to providing $413 million for infrastructure, parks, schools and other improvements. That\u2019s in addition to more than $300 million promised as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity.\nThe City Council is also expected to vote this month on the rezoning of 50-plus blocks in Long Island City, though local Council member Julie Won hasn\u2019t publicly committed to supporting the rezoning, calling for deeper affordability and investments for infrastructure improvements.\nThose rezonings, assuming they are approved, will close out five neighborhood rezonings completed by the Adams administration. Meanwhile, some other major initiatives, such as a text amendment that would require special permits for most last-mile facilities and the Manhattan Plan, will be left to the next mayor (should the next mayor choose to pick them up).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nReporters got a somewhat unusual email today: James Felton Keith, who is planning to challenge Rep. Adriano Espaillat for his seat in New York\u2019s 13th district, says he met with developer Bruce Teitelbaum, who committed to building a 100 percent affordable building as part of One45 in Harlem. This isn\u2019t new: Teitelbaum already agreed to increase the amount of affordable housing in the project if the city and/or state provide additional subsidies. Keith is calling on the mayoral candidates to commit to financing this affordable housing. Will the next mayor provide funding for One45? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: \u201cChi Oss\u00e9 and the People\u2019s Fight to End Forced Broker Fees,\u201d a short documentary by ABC Localish\u2019s Cameron Covell, won a New York Emmy this weekend. The video details the passage of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act last year, from Oss\u00e9\u2019s perspective.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nIf contract negotiations stall, Broadway musicians are prepared to strike,\nGothamist reports\n. The union that represents the musicians, Local 802 AFM, authorized a strike on Sunday night, meaning that a strike could take place if the union and Broadway League are unable to reach an agreement. Musicians are seeking higher wages, better health care coverage and layoff protections, according to Gothamist. Meanwhile, Broadway actors and stage managers have also threatened to strike if they cannot agree on terms for a new contract with the Broadway League.\n\u2014\nA 76-year-old woman was killed in Brooklyn on Sunday by an airborne solar panel on Monday in Brooklyn\n,\nCBS News reports\n. Video of the incident shows strong winds carrying a solar panel from a parking lot structure and falling onto the woman\u2019s head.\n\u2014\u00a0The state Assembly this month will hold a hearing to examine why more upstate localities haven\u2019t adopted rent stabilization. \u201cI want to gauge how strong it is, and whether there are things that would make it easier for localities to accept,\u201d Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who chairs the Housing Committee,\ntold the Times Union\n.\nClosing Time\nDue to the holiday on Monday, no closings were recorded. Check back Tuesday for information on the latest deals.",

The mandate comes after\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nsigned Assembly Bill 628 into law last week.\nThe legislation goes beyond apartments and affects single family rentals as well, if they\u2019re owned by corporations, real estate investment trusts or limited liability companies.\nAssemblymember Tina McKinnor\n, whose district spans from Venice to Hawthorne, authored the bill. McKinnor created the legislation after realizing that refrigerators and stoves were legally labeled as amenities.\nThe average rent in Los Angeles is nearly $2,800 a month, nearly $700 higher than the national average, according to Zillow. San Francisco has some of the highest residential rents in the country, averaging almost $3,700 a month.\n\nA 2022 Los Angeles Times investigation\nfound\nthat California had more apartments without refrigerators on the market than any other state. Landlords were only required to maintain some \u201cstandard characteristics\u201d for a residential unit, including hot and cold running water, heat and weather proofing. McKinnor advocated to include a fridge and stove as similar necessities for a rental unit to be considered habitable.\n\u201cA working stove and a working refrigerator are not luxuries. They are a necessary part of modern life,\u201d McKinnor\nsaid\nin a statement prior to\nNewsom\u2019s signature\n. \u201cBy making these necessary appliances standard in rental homes, California can provide all of its residents with a safer, more affordable and more dignified place to call home.\u201d\nLandlords looking to skip out on providing these appliances only have another two and a half months to do so. The law requiring them to provide a stove capable of generating heat for cooking and a refrigerator capable of safely storing food for new leases goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The community, southeast of Morris Dido Newark and Bonds Ranch roads near Eagle Mountain Lake, is slated for nearly 1,800 homes, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nPMB Capital secured city approvals in 2022 for a 1,900-home plan, but Centurion has since adjusted the layout to 1,761 single-family homes built across four phases.\nIBC Bank is providing financing for the development, which will feature homes from Coventry Homes, D.R. Horton, First Texas Homes and HistoryMaker Homes on lots between 50- to 80-foot lots.\nConstruction on the first phase is expected to begin in early 2027. Fort Worth\u2019s explosive population growth is driving suburban housing demand, Moayedi said.\n\nThe deal deepened Centurion\u2019s bet on the north Fort Worth market.\nThe company is planning\nAlpha Ranch\n, a 1,825-acre community along Sendera Ranch Boulevard north of Fort Worth that could eventually include 4,000 homes. Rio Claro also sits near the Estates at Eagle Mountain, an 836-acre, 1,126-lot subdivision in the works by other builders, adding to the surge of residential activity around the lake.\nAs rooftops rise, infrastructure is trying to keep pace. Fort Worth officials are weighing a $200 million plan to widen\nBonds Ranch Road\n, add streetlights and upgrade intersections to ease congestion tied to the area\u2019s rapid build-out. The corridor has become a magnet for national homebuilders, including Lennar and D.R. Horton, both of which already have multiple projects nearby.\nCenturion American has developed more than 200,000 home lots across North Texas since 1990, including Collin County\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLegacy Hills\nand the billion-dollar overhaul of the former\nCollin Creek Mall\nin Plano.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $47.6 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 263 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 19 contracts totaling $71.5 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe team\u2019s report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 49 new listings, and a total of 1,065 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that found buyers last week, nine were single-family homes and one was a\u00a0 condo. The condo that went pending is asking $6.5 million, or $2,311 per square foot, and spent\u00a0 541 days on the market.\n\nThe single-family homes total $41.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 91 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $4.6 million.\nThe top listing to find a buyer last week was the 7,600-square-foot house at 17153 Ericarose Court in Boca Raton asking $9.5 million. Records show the owner is David Kreiss, the president of Palm Beach Gardens-based KM2 Solutions, a firm that specializes in outsourcing customer relationship management services. He bought the home, which is in the gated St. Andrews Country Club community, for $4.7 million in 2020, according to property records. It was built in 1988 on 0.9 acres and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a pool, records show.\nKreiss listed it in September, Zillow shows. Jeannine Patricia Morris and Blake Benjamin Morris with Lang Realty have the listing.\nThe second-most expensive home to go pending was unit A2 at One Royal Palm Way at 100 Royal Palm Way in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $6.5 million. Records show the seller is the trust of the late Elizabeth Bowden, who bought the unit with her late husband Charles W. Bowden Jr. for $600,000 in 1994. He was a real estate developer in the Philadelphia area, according to his obituary. The unit spans 2,810 square feet, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, records show.\nIt hit the market for $9.3 million in 2023, Zillow shows. Dana and Paulette Koch with the Corcoran Group have the listing.\n",

        "content": "A city north of the Illinois border \u2014 popular with Chicagoland commuters \u2014 was one of the hottest real estate markets in the country in September, according to a ranking that showed strong activity in affordable Midwest markets.\nKenosha, Wisconsin, was the third-hottest real estate market nationally last month. The city, about 60 miles north of Chicago, was joined by six other Wisconsin markets and two in Illinois in the top 20, ranked by days on the market and activity on Realtor.com\u2019s listing page.\nKenosha properties received about 2.7 times more views per property than the U.S. average in September. Kenosha houses spent about 34 days on the market last month, compared to the national median of 62 days.\nThe rankings reveal buyers are increasingly interested in low-cost markets outside major hubs like Chicago, where prices are rising and\nlow inventory is squeezing availability\n.\nKenosha is a popular destination for\npeople moving out of the Chicago area\n, said Ben Gentile, a broker with Epique Realty who works in Kenosha and nearby communities. As the Chicago\nsuburbs have gone up in price\nand\nproperty taxes keep rising\n, Gentile said he\u2019s seen a growing number of buyers leaving the area for southeast Wisconsin.\n\u201cPeople from Cook County are moving into the suburbs for affordability, safety, things like that,\u201d Gentile said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s pushing people out of the suburbs to relocate out to these other areas that are less expensive.\u201d\n\nKenosha\u2019s placement on Interstate 94, between Chicago and Milwaukee, makes it a common place for commuters to the larger cities, Gentile said. He said a sizable chunk of new Kenosha residents are commuters who work in the Chicago area, often in the suburbs.\nOne reason for Kenosha\u2019s red-hot market is a persistent low inventory, Gentile said, as construction has not kept up with demand. Sellers can command high prices for their listings, and there\u2019s a large pool of buyers eager to snatch up available houses. That influx of interest can make buying difficult for locals, especially first-time buyers, Gentile said.\nThe median home sale price in Kenosha increased from $185,000 in August 2020 to $296,000 in August of this year, according to Redfin. Prices this August were up 22 percent year-over-year from last August.\nA similar picture is playing out elsewhere in Wisconsin: Appleton and Wassau tied for fifth place in Realtor.com\u2019s hotness rankings, while Racine, just north of Kenosha, came in seventh. The Janesville and Green Bay markets ranked ninth and 10th, while the Milwaukee metro ranked 19th. Properties in those Wisconsin markets were viewed at least twice as much as the national average and spent fewer than 40 days on the market.\nIn Illinois, two markets cracked the list: Rockford came in eighth, with 2.9 times more views per property than the national average. The average Rockford house was listed at $250,000 and spent 38 days on the market. Springfield, where the average listing price was $204,000, ranked 12th. Houses there were viewed 2.4 times more than the national average and spent 34 days on the market.\nSeveral apartment and residential projects are underway in the Kenosha area, according to local reporting. But with the long timeline and high cost of construction, it\u2019s likely Kenosha will stay hot and remain a seller\u2019s market for at least the next few years.\n",

        "content": "In a case that typifies landlords\u2019 exasperation with New York City\u2019s dysfunctional eviction process, on Oct. 9, Tasheem Jenkins was finally ousted from Apartment D of 367 Wadsworth Avenue, where he had\nlived rent-free\nfor two years.\nThe Washington Heights case was remarkable in that Jenkins, with some help from the Adams administration but without a lawyer, staved off eviction for so long.\nYet at the same time it was unremarkable: It echoed the experiences of landlords and their lawyers in the post-pandemic era, during which housing court\u2019s pace has slowed from that of a sloth to that of an oak tree.\nThe last three months were a microcosm of the entire case against Jenkins and the fashion model Aubrey Hill, with whom Jenkins had shared the rent-stabilized apartment before taking it over.\nThe landlord had not been aware of their sublet agreement. But in New York City, once people are inside a unit, even if they have no lease and do not pay rent, it can be exceedingly difficult to get them out.\nIn mid July, Justice Adam Meyers ruled that Jenkins had exhausted his legal arguments, noting that the landlord \u201cwas awarded judgment of possession against Jenkins almost a year ago, and its ability to realize this relief cannot be delayed indefinitely.\u201d\nStill, the judge paused the eviction through Aug. 29 to give Jenkins six more rent-free weeks \u201cto vacate the premises with dignity.\u201d\nBut Jenkins did not vacate. Just before he was to leave, he filed a motion with the court, as he had done repeatedly each time his eviction date neared. The judge, despite his earlier decision, pushed back the date yet again, to Oct. 7.\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, Jenkins filed another order to show cause on Oct. 6. This time, he didn\u2019t contest the eviction but asked the court to postpone it once more, \u201cpossibly a few more days while I am trying to move out.\u201d He said he was looking for movers and added, \u201cI have an update from HRA/APS.\u201d\n\nJenkins was referring to the Human Resources Administration, and a division of it called Adult Protective Services. According to its\nwebsite\n, APS \u201cprovides services for physically and/or mentally impaired adults\u201d and \u201cworks to help at-risk clients live safely in their homes.\u201d\nBut Meyers had ruled over the summer that Jenkins was not impaired, based in part on his able representation of himself in housing court since the fall of 2023. APS had reached a similar conclusion in February.\nThe judge denied Jenkins\u2019 last-ditch request, writing by hand that he \u201chas been afforded ample time to complete his move.\u201d\nJenkins, as he had signaled, then turned back to APS, a card he\u2019d\nplayed twice before\n. The unit, like its parent agency, has gotten into the business of delaying evictions and thus the city\u2019s obligation to provide shelter.\nAPS then apparently persuaded the Department of Investigation \u2014 which oversees city marshals, who carry out evictions \u2014 to stop the clock on Jenkins\u2019 removal. How DOI can trump a housing court judge is unclear, but this was not the first time.\nThis spring, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported, the agency forbade a marshal from enforcing a co-op\u2019s eviction order against an elderly woman named Emma Oliver, who was squatting in a building from which she had\nembezzled $122,680\nand then stopped paying maintenance for six years.\nBut Jenkins\u2019 third go-round with APS bought him less time than the first two. After a two-day stay, DOI cleared the eviction with APS and allowed the marshal to execute it.\nJenkins will never have to pay the landlord a dime, in all likelihood, because he never had a lease for the $1,675-a-month apartment. The leaseholder was his family friend Hill, the first high fashion model from West Virginia, so the arrears \u2014 which exceed $60,000 \u2014 are technically her responsibility.\nIt is uncertain if the landlord will seek a judgment against Hill or, if he gets one, whether he could even collect on it: After agreeing to a settlement for her back rent in late 2023, Hill neglected to pay and instead\nmoved to Europe\n. Interest and arrears have been accruing ever since.\n",

        "content": "Housing Trust Group won approval from the city of Hollywood for Hillcrest Village, an all-affordable, eight-story apartment development with 110 units in the city\u2019s Hillcrest area.\nThe Hollywood City Commission voted unanimously last week to rezone the Hillcrest Village development site, approve the proposed site plan, and modify a master plan for the planned development of\nthe city\u2019s Hillcrest area\njust west of I-95 along Pembroke Road.\nThe market for rent-restricted apartments at Hillcrest Village probably will include current residents of the Hillcrest area, Hollywood Vice Mayor Idelma Quintana said at the city commission meeting.\n\u201cOne of the reasons that I gave for supporting this project was the understanding that there are many current Hillcrest residents who are having trouble meeting their own housing costs and are concerned about being able to stay in the community,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cSome of the folks there are afraid of losing their condos.\u201d\nHTG plans to reserve the one- and two-bedroom apartments for renters who earn 30 percent to 80 percent of area median income. That equates to a range of $28,860 to $76,960, based on data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that shows that Broward County\u2019s median household income is $96,200.\n\nThe longtime owner of the 2.5-acre development site at 1101 Hillcrest Drive is Hollywood-based\nTobin\n, a family owned real estate business led by Chairman and CEO Herbert A. Tobin and President and COO Jason L. Tobin.\nTobin jointly applied for city approvals for the\naffordable housing\ndevelopment with Miami-based Housing Trust Group, led by President and CEO Matthew Rieger and Executive Chairman and founder Randy Rieger.\nThe mixed-income apartment building would have a specific number of units for renters based on their income. The majority, 52 units, would be reserved for renters with up to 60 percent of area median income. Another 31 units would be for renters with up to 70 percent of AMI. Renters with up to 30 percent of AMI would occupy 17 of the units, and those with up to 80 percent would occupy 10 of the units.\nAmenities planned for Hillcrest Village include a pool, gym, clubhouse and caf\u00e9, along with Amazon parcel lockers, a playground and a rooftop community garden. The mixed-use development also is designed with 744 square feet of office space.\nIn approving the site plan for Hillcrest Village, city commissioners also selected one of two possible architectural designs for the development. The commissioners chose the original design at their meeting last week, after\nHousing Trust Group\npresented an alternative design to them.\nIn August, the Hollywood Planning and Development Board recommended approval of HTG\u2019s proposed site plan, on the condition that the developer prepare and present an alternative design for the Hollywood City Commission\u2019s review.",

        "content": "It was the personal touch that won over Jay Luchs when Antonio Villaraigosa \u2014 a Democrat making his second run for California governor \u2014 called to talk about real estate.\n\u201cI respect him for picking up the phone and calling me to talk business personally and it made me interested in supporting him,\u201d Luchs, executive vice chairman at Newmark in Los Angeles, said via email.\nPlus there\u2019s the former Los Angeles mayor\u2019s stance on\nMeasure ULA\n, a property tax which is criticized by developers in California for increasing the cost of and slowing the pace of development, despite being intended to fund housing solutions.\n\u201cHe seems to get [that Measure] ULA not working and is sensitive to it,\u201d Luchs said. \u201cIt took the life out of residential and commercial property sales. It\u2019s nice to have someone get that.\u201d\nLuchs donated a total of $10,175.25 for Villaraigosa\u2019s 2026 campaign, according to\nan\nanalysis of contributions to 2026 gubernatorial candidates via\nCalifornia Secretary of State records\nby\nThe Real Deal\n.\nVillaraigosa, 72, leads on fundraising from donors among a crowded field\nof contenders in the governor\u2019s race, which is slated for a primary election in June, with the top two finishers squaring off in the general election in November 2026. He has garnered $4.5 million via 787 contributions.\nThe top fundraiser overall, so far, is Stephen Cloobeck, a Democrat and former CEO of timeshare company Diamond Resorts. Cloobeck, who has raked in $13.6 million on 172 contributions. Cloobeck\u2019s own $13 million in donations\u00a0 to himself put him at the top of the fundraising list at this point, but he also got some contributions from real estate executives, including $72,800 from\nWilliam Meldman, chairman of\nDiscover Land Company\n, a Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered real estate developer and operator of private residential communities and resorts, and another $20,500 from five of his employees. Cloobeck also received $51,400 from family-owned real estate investment firm Randall Realty Group, led by\nJames Randall\n, the airplane rivet king-turned-philanthropist, and $36,400 from Jim Murren, former CEO of MGM Resorts International.\nVillaraigosa served as the mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013, the first Latino to hold the post since 1872. He started in elected office in the state Assembly, and served as Speaker from 1998 to 2000, lost a run for mayor in 2001, and served two years in the Los Angeles City Council before winning the mayor\u2019s race in 2005. Villaraigosa ran for governor\nin 2018\n, losing to eventual winner Gavin Newsom in the primary, failing to make the runoff.\nNo L.A. mayor has ever made it to the governor\u2019s office, according to\nCalMatters\n. But that hasn\u2019t stopped other high-profile real estate players like\nWestside Estate Agency\n\u2019s\nKurt Rappaport\n, developer\nJoseph Moinian\nand Related California\u2019s\nBill Witte\nfrom supporting Villaraigosa.\nRappaport, a top broker and co-founder and CEO of Westside Estate Agency, has shelled out $72,800 (the maximum contribution per candidate in an election cycle, including $39,200 for the primary and $39,200 for the general election). Moinian, a New York City-based developer with Los Angeles properties in its portfolio, and Witte, chairman and CEO of Related California, dropped $5,000 apiece.\nAlagem Capital Group\u2019s Beny Alagem, a\nminority partner\nin One Beverly Hills, and owner of the Beverly Hilton and the adjacent Waldorf-Astoria, donated $35,000.\nBeyond real estate, Villaraigosa received donations from bigwigs in the entertainment industry, including \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d host Ryan Seacrest ($72,800), film director Rob Reiner ($7,500), and Jon Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate film studio ($5,000). (In his first run, Villaraigosa appeared at an event hosted by Seacrest.)\nIn addition, Villaraigosa received $72,800 from one of the biggest landowners in the state, Stewart Resnick, chairman of Wonderful Company with food and beverage brands including Wonderful Pistachios &amp; Almonds, POM Wonderful and FIJI Water. The candidate also got $5,000 from Dominic Ng, chairman and CEO of East West Bank, a major commercial real estate lender.\nL.A. Mayor\nKaren Bass\n, who endorsed her longtime ally, contributed $1,046 to his campaign.\nThe playing field\n\nDeveloper Rick Caruso, a Democrat since 2022,\nmay or may not\nrun for governor and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla is\nmulling\nentry to the race, but there are a slew of candidates who have declared their intention to replace incumbent Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited out.\nOne is Katie Porter, who served as a U.S. representative from California from 2019 to 2025. The Democrat, who has come under fire for her conduct in several recently released videos, brought in just under $3 million in 13,794 contributions. Her donors include Richard K. Robbins, owner of construction company Wareham Property Group ($39,200); Thumbrack CEO Marco Zappacosta ($20,000); and Joseph Kampfer, chairman of McArthurGlen Group, developer and manager of designer outlet malls ($5,000).\nBritish native, former conservative political adviser and former Fox News host Steve Hilton garnered $1.88 million via 1,306 contributions, all in small sums. The Republican received $500 donations from real estate professionals such as Andrew Mortaza, director of the luxury estates division at The Agency, Sotheby\u2019s agent Jeffrey Earl Warren and Papadopoulos Properties\u2019 Thomas Papadopoulos.\nChad Bianco, the Republican sheriff of Riverside County, California, collected $1.87 million in 3,256 contributions. Those came from retail developer Alexander Haagen III, chairman and CEO of Haagen Company ($39,200), and Highland Fairview, a full-service real estate development company ($39,200).\nFormer state controller Betty Yee, a Democrat, notched $1.6 million through 4,588 contributions for her gubernatorial run, including $5,000 from Dara Smith, deputy assessor for the Los Angeles county assessor\u2019s office, the nation\u2019s largest property assessment agency.\nDemocrat Tony Thurmond, the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and a former social worker, claims $1.4 million in support through 1,421 contributions. Among his donors are\u00a0 Gerry Kamilos\u2019 Kamilos Companies ($36,400); Moses Libitzky of Emeryville, California-based Libitzky Property Companies ($39,200); and John Sobrato, co-owner of the NFL\u2019s San Francisco 49ers and chairman of the Sobrato Organization real estate organization ($20,000). Robbins, who contributed to Porter, gave $15,000 to Thurmond.\nIndependent candidate\nEthan Penner\n, the\npioneer of commercial mortgage-backed securities\n, received $552,506.02 in 50 contributions, with more than $100,000 coming from\nhimself\n. He received backing from James \u201cWatty\u201d Watson, managing partner of commercial real estate CT Realty Investors. The executive, based in Dallas, coughed up $39,200.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Ethan for over 30 years, which feels like a lifetime,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, solution-minded, a financial rockstar, exceptional business builder/value creator and has a huge heart.\u201d\nAmong other things, Watson said via email: \u201cHe is passionate about California and is particularly focused on repairing the tragic condition of California for his children. As a proven financial genius and fair-minded and practical business manager, it\u2019s possible he can prevent this great state from hitting the wall.\u201d\nWatson\u2019s colleague, Carter Ewing, managing partner at CT Realty based in Newport Beach, contributed $25,000.\n\u201cEthan has some very creative ideas for righting the ship,\u201d Ewing shared over email, \u201cfrom eliminating state income tax to establishing investment savings accounts for California\u2019s youth. He has some unique ideas for balancing our budget and ensuring California\u2019s residents are vested in the fiscal success of our state.\u201d\nIn addition to Penner\u2019s financial background, Ewing said, \u201cEthan\u2019s family reflects California\u2019s diversity, with his wife Marisol (an immigrant from Venezuela) and their five children, including two adopted sons from Ethiopia and Venezuela.\u201d\nChad Carpenter, founder and CEO of La Jolla-based real estate investment management firm Reven Capital, shelled out $2,868.52 for Penner\u2019s campaign.\nBrian Lavin, executive chairman of NTS Capital who handles the firm\u2019s real estate development and land acquisitions, paid out $10,000.\nCandidates that have recently raised less than $500,000 or had no funds listed include Republican Leo Zacky, a business executive and entrepreneur and former candidate for governor; former Assemblymember Ian Calderon, a Democrat; and former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration. But Becerra has more than $1 million for his campaign thanks mostly to a transfer of money from a previous congressional campaign.\n",

        "content": "The trade of a\ngrocery-anchored shopping center\n\u2014 home to an outpost of\ngrocer H-E-B\n\u2014 marks the largest retail transaction in Alamo City since 2021.\nA joint venture of MCB Real Estate, Epic Real Estate Partners and Centerbridge Partners purchased the 440,000-square-foot Northwoods Shopping Center, according to a release from MCB, which is based in Baltimore. Epic is based in Austin, and Centerbridge is in New York.\nTruist Bank provided the acquisition loan.\nNorthwoods, at 18140 San Pedro Drive, is at the intersection of Highway 281 and Loop 1604. The spot has a daytime population of 114,000 people within a 3 mile radius.\nBarshop &amp; Oles Company developed the property in 1996. In addition to H-E-B, the center is home to Nordstrom Rack, Marshall\u2019s, Ulta and\nBarnes &amp; Noble, which is having a renaissance\nafter years of being dominated by Amazon. The shopping center is 91 percent leased.\n\nMCB has been on a retail tear in the last two years, picking up Falcon Ridge Shopping Center in Fontana, California, and Takoma Park Shopping Center near Washington, D.C. The firm also acquired a former Century 21 store in Brooklyn with plans to spend $100 million redeveloping the property.\nRetail has proven to be a wise real estate investment after warnings about the death knell of retail after the Great Financial Crisis kept developers from building new products. As a result, space is limited and rents are high.\nRetail rents are up from a year ago in San Antonio, increasing from $19.47 to $19.82 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are low, hovering between 3.9 and 4 percent over the last 12 months.\nThe lack of inventory means the market has been able to weather headwinds like the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\nand Forever 21.\nExperiential users like gyms\nare gobbling up that space.\n",

        "content": "New York elected officials think they can use regulation to bend the laws of economics. And sometimes they can. Rent stabilization, for example, uses price controls to keep rents\nartificially low\non 1 million apartments.\nUsually, however, the government must heap regulation upon regulation and build a\nrobust enforcement infrastructure\nto defy natural market forces \u2014 and even then, there will be\ncheating\n. The marijuana industry is discovering this now.\nWhen New York lawmakers legalized weed, they didn\u2019t just revoke criminal statutes. They insisted that all weed sold in New York also be grown in New York.\nBut weed grown elsewhere is cheaper. California, for example, has more farmland, more sun, and a mature industry. Economies of scale makes West Coast cannabis less costly than New York\u2019s, even with the transportation expense and the illegality of shipping it here.\nAs a result, between 50 percent and 80 percent of weed sold by licensed retailers in New York is not grown here, contrary to the law, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Market forces are strong, and cannabis enforcement is too weak to overcome the Pollyannish ideal imagined by New York legislators: an entirely in-state, seed-to-sale system.\nThe big takeaway is that as supply has flooded in from beyond our borders, the price of cannabis biomass has fallen by 45 percent.\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice (for tenants, homebuyers and employers) if New York could reduce rents and home prices by 45 percent?\nOf course, we cannot simply import dwellings (except for modular homes, but we cannot import land to put them on). We could, however, boost housing supply by reforming\nproperty taxes\n, zoning, rent stabilization, the \u201c\nscaffold law\n\u201d and other regulatory schemes.\nJust to take one of a thousand examples, think about the process for replacing a small, decrepit apartment building with a larger, modern, energy-efficient one.\n\nBecause of\ntenant protections\n, it takes years and sometimes decades to empty a building. For all that time, units sit empty while the owner waits for a few remaining tenants to move, die or accept a buyout.\nPerhaps that helps tenants in that one building, but it doesn\u2019t help tenants overall to keep units empty in the teeth of a housing shortage. The bigger issue is that the process is so costly and onerous that most undersized, aging buildings remain in place year after year.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of how lawmakers have made housing more expensive in an effort to make it cheaper.\nAt the very least, the state should let developers replace small apartment buildings with large ones if they keep the same number of rent-stabilized units, house tenants during construction and give them the right to return.\nBut the biggest supply boost would come from putting the interests of all tenants over those in a particular building.\nLegislators should think about the housing crisis as they try to fix the marijuana cheating problem that they created.\nThe economic lesson is simple: Weed sellers (and some farmers) are bringing down the cost of cannabis by buying it from states that have a surplus.\nHousing would be cheaper, too, not to mention nicer, safer and more energy-efficient, if we allowed developers to create a surplus. And it\u2019s a lot better for you than weed.\n",

The state-run Lawyer\u2019s Fund for Client Protection, which reimburses victims of attorney theft, denied Brown\u2019s claim this year, partly because Bragg\u2019s office never investigated.\nThe Fund has reimbursed just two of Zekaria\u2019s former clients to date, despite reports from a court-appointed receiver that roughly 30 people may have been affected.\n\n\u201cThe silence from the Manhattan DA continues to be deafening,\u201d the receiver wrote to Brown last year.\nBragg\u2019s office said it would \u201cre-review\u201d the complaint and contact the Fund after questioning from the publication. A spokesperson said the DA takes \u201cfinancial fraud in Manhattan, especially misconduct by attorneys, very seriously.\u201d\nThe Fund\u2019s chair, Eric Seiff, admitted that without DA findings, claims often stall. In Brown\u2019s case, he said, \u201cIf we had any kind of document to confirm that the money was received in Zekaria\u2019s escrow account, it would make it a different story.\u201d\nZekaria pleaded guilty to robbing almost $400,000 from three other clients, stealing escrow funds and performing no legal work despite imposing a significant fee. She faces six years in prison if she fails to pay restitution by May.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Vacancy has climbed above 32 percent, with tenants averaging just under four years left on their leases, according to marketing materials.\nThe German-born and Chicago-based Jahn, who died in 2021, completed the building in 1986, adding tiered outdoor terraces on each floor from the third up. He once shrugged off questions about the design\u2019s likeness to an \u201cN,\u201d telling the Chicago Tribune that \u201csometimes it\u2019s better to let somebody generate their own perceptions.\u201d\nThe sale comes as the post-pandemic office slump weighs on suburban landlords. Across the\nChicago\nregion, hybrid work and high borrowing costs have depressed property values, prompting institutional owners like Equus to test the market for assets that may have long-term upside.\n\nEven so, Newmark broker Jim Postweiler told the outlet that he sees \u201csigns of an improving market\u201d for office trades, particularly for buildings with strong visibility and leasing potential.\n\u201cOffice is still discounted by any historical standard,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for properties like MetroWest that are high quality with leasing upside, the market is trending in a positive direction.\u201d\nNewmark\nis marketing the tower as a chance to acquire a well-known suburban office at a deep discount, touting its location, architecture and move-in-ready spec suites.\nEquus also put its\nMid America Plaza\ncomplex in Oakbrook Terrace on the market earlier this year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A pair of developers propose two separate Live Local Act projects in Miami with 791 units combined, continuing the flurry of applications under the state\u2019s workforce housing law.\nIn the Wynwood Norte neighborhood, Alexis Bogomolni\u2019s ABH Developer Group wants to build the 36-story, 293-unit Wyn Park at 3311 and 3327 Northwest Second Avenue, 169 Northwest 33rd Street and 182 Northwest 34th Street, according to the developer\u2019s filings to the city.\nIn Overtown, an entity tied to restaurateur Alan Omsky, co-founder of KYU restaurant, proposes a 55-story, 498-unit tower 1210 Northwest Second Avenue and 211 and 223 Northwest 12th Street, according to the developer\u2019s filings.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board will vote on each proposal at its meeting on Wednesday.\nDesigned by Modis Architects, Wyn Park would rise atop a nine-story parking podium with commercial space, and would consist of studio and one- and two-bedroom apartments. It will have 117 apartments with below-market rate rents, in line with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement that at least 40 percent of a project\u2019s units are for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nOmsky\u2019s Kobi Karp-designed tower would have 200 apartments at below-market rate rents, which also equates to 40 percent of the total units. It would consist of studios, one- and two-bedroom units, plus 200 micro-units spanning over 275 square feet each. The application doesn\u2019t specify whether the micro-units will be the below-market rate rentals. The tower will rise atop a nine-story podium with exterior murals of portraits of Overtown residents by artist Yana Volf.\n\nThe\nLive Local Act\n, a state law approved in 2023, allows developers to build bigger buildings as long as they include below-market rate apartments. The units have to remain designated for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI for at least 30 years.\nMiami-based ABH Developer, founded in 2021 by Bogomolni, is a real estate investment, land entitlement and development firm, according to its website. It lists projects in Bay Harbor Islands, Hollywood, Wynwood and Wynwood Norte.\nThe Wyn Park project appears to have been tweaked and enlarged under the Live Local Act. ABH\u2019s website describes it as a 120-unit mixed-use project with multifamily, offices and retail.\nThe firm has had a hefty Wynwood Norte\nfocus\n, where its projects include the six-story, 44-unit Wyn Ave with 2,400 square feet of retail at 3332 Northwest Fifth Avenue; the five-story, 24-unit W35 with 2,500 square feet of retail at 319 Northwest 35th Street. Both are apartment buildings.\nWynwood Norte\nis a district near Wynwood that city officials approved in 2021, spurring more development. Proponents have argued the zoning rules also will preserve the district\u2019s character. Wynwood Norte spans about 140 acres between Northeast and Northwest 29th Street and 36th Street, and between North Miami Avenue and Northwest Seventh Avenue.\nOvertown\n, once a preeminent commerce and culture center for Miami\u2019s Black community, is experiencing redevelopment, including with affordable housing. Housing Trust Group and NBA Hall of Famer Alonzo Mourning\u2019s nonprofit AM Affordable Housing plan the $58 million\nCourtside Apartments II\nwith 120 affordable apartments in a pair of seven-story buildings at 1698 Northwest Third Avenue and 1501 Northwest Fourth Avenue.\nOthers are bringing luxury development to Overtown. Last summer, PMG, Michael Simkins\u2019 Lion Development Group and Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development launched sales of the 22-story. 372-unit short-term rental-friendly\nOne West Twelve Residences\ncondo project at 105 Northwest 11th Terrace.",

That part of the mall is occupied by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Burlington.\nBurlington assumed the lease at the property from\nprevious tenant Joann\nafter the fabric and craft chain\nclosed all of its locations, including 31 in Southern California\n.\nThe other property, a 30,600-square-foot single-tenant building at 26583 Carl Boyer Drive, was sold to a Washington-based 1031 exchange buyer. That building is occupied by Sky Zone Trampoline Park and sold in an off-market deal for $8.8 million. Sky Zone reportedly signed a new long-term lease at the site.\nOther\nretail properties in Southern California\nhave been trading hands in recent weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, Costa Mesa-based real estate investor CenterCal Properties and private equity firm DRA Advisors acquired the Long Beach Towne Center for $145 million. Phoenix-based mall giant Vestar was the seller of the 870,000-square-foot property.\nLast month, Steerpoint and Steelwave jointly\npurchased The Shoppes at Carlsbad\nfor $71.5 million, or $98 per square foot, marking quite a drop in value from the $170 million that previous owner Brookfield Properties paid for the mall in 2015.\nIn August, a joint venture between Pacific Retail Capital Partners,\nLyon Living\nand Silverpeak\nspent $332.1 million\nfor the Lakewood Center mall in Lakewood.

        "content": "As LuxUrban Hotels winds its way through the bankruptcy process, a branch of the Justice Department is calling for an independent trustee to be placed in charge of the company.\nAttorneys for the Office of the U.S. Trustee filed a motion last week for an independent trustee to take over the bankrupt firm, Bisnow\nreported\n. The motion described the bankruptcy case as a \u201cfree fall\u201d and described \u201cchaos\u201d encountered by customers and creditors alike, pointing to \u201cgross negligence\u201d on the part of LuxUrban.\n\u201cA hotel operator \u2026 that leaves customers stranded, places people in rooms where no services are available, and where union workers appear to have been unpaid, is untenable, and dangerous,\u201d said U.S. Trustee trial attorney Andrea Schwartz.\nLuxUrban filed for bankruptcy a month ago, citing less than $10 million in assets and at least $50 million in liabilities. The company said the Chapter 11 filing would allow it to continue operating four hotels in New York City.\nShortly after the filing, however, news outlets reported that paying customers\nwere showing up\nto claim room reservations at the company\u2019s Manhattan properties, only to be turned away. That prompted letters to the bankruptcy judge, requesting an emergency hearing due to potential consumer harm.\nOne of those letters was sent on the same day the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council alleged that LuxUrban owed weeks of wages to unionized workers and managers. The union also claimed the company was illegally withholding at least $57 million in retirement contributions.\n\nThere are at least 85 lawsuits pending against LuxUrban in either state or federal court, according to Schwartz. The attorney also claimed LuxUrban omitted additional creditors and debtors in its initial bankruptcy filing, including $118 million in overdue state sales taxes.\nLuxUrban\u2019s bankruptcy attorney, Leo Jacobs, did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nThe company has faced a myriad of issues in New York.\nAt the 166-key property known as The Herald, LuxUrban allegedly\nracked up at least $1.6 million in arrears\nthrough December, leading a judge to approve the landlord\u2019s eviction request this summer as ownership tried to fend off foreclosure.\nOther problems range from\na $1.2 million city fine\nover illegal Airbnb rentals to a Nasdaq delisting. The company\u2019s also been accused of overstating its hotel holdings and is facing a shareholder class action lawsuit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Justin Rundle is rescinding his accusations that his ex-business partners, the father-and-son team that leads Canero Group, allegedly committed fraud and misappropriated project funds in connection with six developments in Miami-Dade County.\nOn Sept. 19,\nRundle\n, son of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Rundle, voluntarily dismissed his lawsuit against Jose Canero Sr., Jose Canero Jr., Miami-based Canero Group, and Ricardo Casanova, a business associate of the Caneros, after reaching a settlement, court records show.\nRundle\nsought in excess of $3 million in damages after investing $625,000 in the projects, and also claiming to have raised $6.3 million from other investors. In an emailed statement provided by his attorney, Rundle said an \u201cindependent third-party accountant has made a finding that there was no fraud or misappropriation of funds.\u201d\n\u201cI have accepted that opinion and hereby withdraw all fraud allegations previously made against the Caneros and Casanova,\u201d Rundle\u2019s statement said, adding that he is no longer a partner in the six projects, which include a 54-unit townhouse project in Homestead and a 10-townhome development in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside neighborhood.\nRundle\u2019s lawyer, Melanie Damian, said her client reached a confidential settlement with the Caneros and Casanova.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Canero Jr. said Coral Gables-based accounting firm Shechter &amp; Everett conducted a full review of the entities that own the projects.\nCanero Group\n, founded in 2012, has built \u201ca reputation for honesty and transparency,\u201d Canero Jr. added.\n\u201cEveryone connected with The Canero Group is extremely grateful to get this matter behind us,\u201d Canero Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult when one\u2019s reputation and character are unjustly assailed, but have been vindicated.\u201d\nCanero Group primarily focuses on development of luxury homes and townhouses, but recently expanded into multifamily projects. In May, the firm paid a combined\n$17.3 million\nto buy out all the owners of Chateau Grove, a 25-unit condominium in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. Canero Group plans to convert the property into apartments.\nIn his May complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, Rundle alleged that the Caneros grossly mismanaged the projects. Rundle also accused the Caneros of paying themselves and Canero Group expenses by using project funds without investors\u2019 authorizations.\nIn a June response to Rundle\u2019s lawsuit, Canero Jr. and his father accused their ex-business partner of skirting Florida Bar rules governing conflicts of interests. Rundle, a real estate attorney who previously represented\nCanero Group\non some transactions, allegedly got into business with Canero Sr. and Canero Jr. without first obtaining a conflict of interest waiver from both of them, the response states.\nInstead, Rundle allegedly sought to get the Caneros to sign the waiver in 2024, two years after they became partners, according to the response. The Caneros also alleged Rundle attempted to sideskirt an arbitration clause in the operating agreements for the entities that own the projects.",

County Board member Sam Tornatore, who chairs the development committee, said the measure represents regulatory and revenue opportunity.\nThe fees would funnel into a county housing fund to support long-term affordability efforts, including low-interest loans and construction financing. The plan aligns with County Board Chair Deb Conroy\u2019s broader housing strategy, which includes a proposed $5 million down-payment assistance program for first-time buyers, to be launched using surplus funds from the 2025 budget.\n\nThe amendment also caps occupancy at five unrelated guests per property, though hosts could seek special event permits for larger gatherings. Inspectors would ensure compliance with county and state codes before properties are cleared for operation.\nIf approved, DuPage would join a growing number of suburban governments taking a structured approach to short-term rentals, balancing resident complaints with demand from homeowners looking to monetize their properties.\nOther cities have addressed issues with short-term rentals with various strategies.\nChicago aldermen squabbled this spring over whether to lower the threshold of ward-wide bans on short-term rentals if enough residents sign a\npetition\n.\nHighland Park blocked a timeshare plan for \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of Michael Jordan\u2019s former\nestate\nlast month.\nNaperville banned short-term rentals in 2020, while other municipalities have adopted hybrid systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The properties are owned by affiliates of San Francisco-based Swift Real Estate Partners, and Newmark has the listing.\nThe offices are Mount Diablo Plaza, a two-building, 340,600-square-foot office property in Walnut Creek; Amberglen, a 157,700-square-foot office in Hillsboro, Oregon; and Bel-Kirk 520, a 92,800-square-foot office in\nBellevue, Washington\n.\nSwift\nbought Mount Diablo Plaza in 2017 for $117 million. It purchased Amberglen that same year and Bel-Kirk 520 two years later. The loan originated for $101.7 million between 2017 and 2019 and was cross-collateralized last February. The Walnut Creek property accounts for 82 percent of the unpaid principal balance on the loan.\nThe listing opens the door for an investor to acquire the three office properties via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. That maneuver has become common in the region over the past year.\n\nLast October,\nLakeside Group took ownership\nof 180 Grand, an office building in Uptown Oakland, via deed in lieu after\npaying about $30 million\nwith Rubicon Point Partners to acquire the property\u2019s debt.\nIn December, Blox Ventures bought the debt secured by an eight-story office building in Emeryville Public Market; it acquired the property outright earlier this year. And in July, the debt tied to Oakland\u2019s Bruener Building hit the market.\nMount Diablo Plaza is 61 percent leased. Power company Calpine Corporation is the anchor tenant at the property. Under Swift\u2019s ownership, the firm made $13 million of capital investments at the offices, including a revamp of the common areas. Tenants have access to an onsite conference center, fitness center and cafeteria.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two luxury Manhattan hotels have been sold in separate transactions, a sign of returning investor confidence in New York\u2019s high-end hospitality market.\nIn one of the city\u2019s priciest hotel trades in recent years, Kam Sang Company has snapped up the\nEdition Clocktower Hotel\nat 5 Madison Avenue from the\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority\nfor around $250 million, or more than $800,000 per key, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThat makes it one of the highest price-per-key purchases for a New York City hotel in the past two years; MML Hospitality scooped up\nNine Orchard\nin August for $92 million, which worked out to $814,000 per key.\nThe $250 million sale price is still a steep drop from the $337 million the sovereign wealth fund shelled out when it\nbought the hotel\nfrom Marriott International in 2015 as part of its $815 million purchase of three Edition hotels.\nMadison Realty Capital provided a $180 million loan for the purchase. The 273-key property, housed in the iconic clock tower overlooking Madison Square Park, will continue to operate under the Edition brand.\nIn a separate deal, Cain closed on its $175 million purchase of the\nDominick Hotel\nin Soho from CIM Group, sources said. Hudson Bay Capital provided a $155 million loan for the deal.\n\nCIM acquired the 391-key property, formerly known as the Trump Soho Hotel Condominium, through foreclosure in 2014. The firm rebranded the 46-story tower in 2017 after ending a licensing agreement with the Trump Organization. CIM considered selling the hotel several times in recent years, first in 2019 and then again in September 2022. Cain will likely look to reposition the property, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Kam Sang, CIM Group and Cain International did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Eastdil Secured\u2019s Jeffrey Davis and Scott Ellman advised on both deals. Eastdil\u2019s Rob Turner arranged the financing. Eastdil declined to comment.\nThe deals come as New York\u2019s occupancy rates approach pre-pandemic levels and the city\u2019s luxury hotel market surges on the back of rebounding tourism and business travel.\nThe average occupancy rate surpassed 84 percent a week in 2024, up from a pandemic low of about 50 percent, according to a report by Lodging Analytics Research &amp; Consulting. But expenses tied to labor costs, high interest rates and property taxes have hampered the recovery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a healthy hotel market from a revenue perspective,\u201d said Daniel Lesser\nof LW Hospitality Advisors. \u201cThere are and will continue to be challenges in terms of turning revenue into bottom-line profit.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Developer Moishe Mana could be on the hook for $6.6 million to Miami-Dade County tied to a decade-old land swap deal.\nMana\n, who is considered the biggest landlord in downtown Miami and Wynwood, had made a deal with Miami-Dade to trade properties in Wynwood, and he was supposed to develop a Puerto Rican community center and other facilities on one of the lots. But the project never came to fruition.\nNow, Mana and the county have struck another deal. On Thursday, the Miami-Dade Appropriations Committee will vote on a new agreement, which frees Mana from having to develop the project \u2014 as long as he makes the $6.6 million payment and complies with other terms of the agreement. The county plans to use the funds to develop affordable housing.\nMiami-Dade commissioners are expected to consider the item at their Nov. 4 meeting.\nMiami-Dade \u201ctook the money and the land. That\u2019s what I understand from them,\u201d Mana said. \u201cMy lawyer has been dealing with it. But they need to get paid.\u201d\nUnder the original 2015\nland swap agreement\n, Mana was supposed to transfer to the county the 0.4-acre parcel at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue, and the county was to transfer to him a 1.4-acre property at 270 Northwest 23rd Street. Because the county was giving Mana a bigger, \u201cmore valuable\u201d property, according to the memo included in the county committee item, he was supposed to build the Puerto Rican center, and offices for the Miami-Dade\nCommunity Action and Human Services Department and the district 3 commissioner at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue.\nDue to environmental contamination on the development site, Miami-Dade and Mana tweaked their agreement in 2018, with Mana now transferring to the county the 0.4-acre site at 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue where he also would build the 43,600-square-foot Puerto Rican community center and county offices. The project\u2019s estimated cost was $8.4 million, and the county was to contribute $2.5 million from the Building Better Communities General Obligation Bond.\nThe deal was amended twice in 2019 and 2020 to extend the construction deadline and allow for a smaller facility. In 2022, commissioners directed county staff members to re-negotiate the agreement entirely, this time removing Mana\u2019s obligation to develop the project in exchange for the $6.6 million payment.\n\nThe county plans to build affordable housing at 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue, partly funded with Mana\u2019s payment.\nMana, who called this \u201can old deal\u201d that \u201cevolved\u201d over the years, said it was Miami-Dade that decided not to build the Puerto Rican community center and other facilities.\nProperty records show the county transferred the site at 270 Northwest 23rd Street to Mana in 2015, and the parcels at 2153 Northwest Second Avenue and 2900 Northwest Fifth Avenue remain under the ownership of Mana affiliates.\nMana, who has come under scrutiny regarding his slow-moving projects in Miami, recently expanded his Wynwood portfolio. Last month, he paid\n$25.5 million\nfor the 0.7-acre assemblage at 2200-2230 Northwest Second Avenue and 224 Northwest 22nd Terrace in Wynwood.\nIn July, he scored a\n$150 million\nrefinancing for 56 Wynwood properties surrounding the Mana Wynwood Convention Center.\nCurrently, he is focused on his\ndowntown Miami\nredevelopment, he said. He has described his plan as a campus, often using terms such as \u201cconnectivity\u201d among the residents and companies.\nHe has been targeting tech firms in Latin America as potential tenants, mainly through his Mana Tech organization, he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s not about the buildings. It\u2019s really about the content,\u201d he said, adding that the city\u2019s permitting process is cumbersome and slow. \u201cThe idea is we are working on making Latin America and North America one economy.\u201d\n",

Meli\u00e1 Miami Brickell will mark the first Meli\u00e1-branded residential project in Miami. It was previously called Visions at Brickell Station.\nThorne said he also signed a deal with Meli\u00e1 to brand a 520-key hotel in Orlando.\nUNCG\nhired Compass earlier this year\nto handle sales and marketing of Visions at Brickell Station, but parted ways shortly after making the announcement and brought sales in-house. The developer had a ceremonial groundbreaking, but construction did not begin until recently.\nThorne said he will offer agents 10 percent commissions until the end of the year. Sixty percent of those commissions will be paid after the rescission period ends on each contract, with the remaining 40 percent paid at closing.\nThorne said he has presold 58 units. \u201cWe hope to be sold out in six months,\u201d he said.\n\nThe developer secured a $30 million construction loan from Arixa Enhanced Income Fund in September, and construction is underway. It\u2019s expected to be completed in about 20 months, Thorne said.\nProperty records show Thorne paid $8.5 million for the 0.3-acre site in 2023.\nThe design team includes Miami Lakes-based DTI Architects and interior designer Adriana Hoyos, according to a press release.\nUNCG\u2019s portfolio of residential projects includes hundreds of planned condos and townhomes in Orlando, as well as the planned\nElle Residences Miami\n. Thorne is partnering with Fernando de Nu\u00f1ez y Lugones\u2019 Vertical Developments on the 25-story, 180-unit magazine-branded tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater neighborhood.\nThe majority of condo-hotels and short-term rental-friendly condo projects in Miami\u2019s pipeline are concentrated in Brickell, downtown Miami and surrounding neighborhoods, which is expected to result in an oversupply of these units competing with each other, experts say. Investors\nare attracted to condo-hotels\nbecause of the prices and the promise of rental income.\nMeli\u00e1 branded a\ncondo-hotel tower in Hollywood Beach\nthat was completed in 2018.\n",

The property was most recently appraised at $1.19 billion \u2014 south of the $2 billion it was at a decade ago, per Morningstar Credit.\nThe new valuation follows the property\u2019s loan being sent to special servicing and then modified. Cash flow is down at the building but investors say tenant improvements are coming.\nThe property, a 44-story office building between West 47th and 48th streets, is better known as the News Corp building, since it\u2019s home to the Fox News studios, as well as the offices for News Corp publications the Wall Street Journal and New York Post.\nBeacon Capital Partners purchased 1211 Sixth Avenue in 2006 for more than $1.5 billion, the New York Times\nreported\n. Quebecois firm Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge (now called La Caisse) then bought a 49 percent stake in 2013 before purchasing the entirety of the property three years later, for a total value of $1.8 billion.\n\nHowever, conditions at the office building have not kept up the momentum since then. Though revenue improved nominally, it declined in real terms. Last year, revenue was about $170 million, down from an inflation-adjusted $187 million in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit.\nLaw firm Ropes &amp; Gray, which occupies about 17 percent of the space, announced it would be relocating ahead of its 2027 lease expiration.\nDeveloper RXR bought a\n49 percent stake\nin the Midtown building this past January. The property\u2019s loan, with $1.04 million outstanding, was transferred to special servicing in May ahead of an August maturity date. But by the end of the summer, the lender agreed to a\nthree-year extension and modification\n.\nEarlier this month, RXR secured a\n$1.45 billion recapitalization\nof the property. About $367 million is expected to go to improving the tenant experience, leasing commissions and finding a new renter for the space Ropes &amp; Gray occupies.\nRXR and La Caisse did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s suburban office market just logged its strongest quarter of tenant demand since before the pandemic \u2014 but landlords aren\u2019t\ncelebrating\nyet.\nThe suburban vacancy rate held at an all-time high of 32.4 percent at the end of September, according to JLL. That\u2019s virtually unchanged from midyear and up from 31.4 percent a year ago and 22 percent when the\npandemic\nhit, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. It\u2019s also the 19th straight quarter of record-breaking suburban vacancies.\nThe long slide in\noccupancy\n, driven by remote work and corporate downsizing, has left landlords with 4.7 million fewer\noccupied square feet\nsince 2020.\nStill, the third quarter offered a flicker of optimism: net absorption \u2014 the amount of newly leased and occupied space minus what was vacated \u2014 rose by more than 216,000 square feet. That\u2019s only the third positive quarter since 2022 and the strongest performance since late 2019.\nLeading the charge, Fortune Brands Innovations relocated its headquarters to the three-building Amgen campus in Deerfield, dramatically expanding its footprint. ADP also upgraded, subleasing 149,000 square feet in Zurich North America\u2019s Schaumburg headquarters \u2014 a move from an Elk Grove Village site that\u2019s being demolished for a data center redevelopment.\n\nDespite those wins, the\nvacancy rate\nstayed high as inventory swelled. The trend underscores the market\u2019s new normal: firms are trading up to top-tier buildings while bypassing dated offices that now make up the bulk of the empty stock.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t just looking to what\u2019s available \u2014 they\u2019re being creative,\u201d JLL\u2019s Andrea Van Gelder told the outlet, noting that companies are targeting high-amenity workplaces.\nSome balance may be ahead. Major rightsizing is largely done, Van Gelder said, while a growing number of obsolete properties are being razed or converted. A former Walgreens campus along Lake Cook Road has already come down, and the Bannockburn Lakes complex is being repositioned.\n\u201cThere is absorption,\u201d Van Gelder said, \u201cBut the normal levels can\u2019t eat up what the pandemic did.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "On a recent post in r/realestateinvesting, a New York City resident asked their Reddit peers: \u201cManhattan real estate investment, is it still worth it?\u201d\nThe answer for many condo buyers in the last decade has mostly been \u201cno,\u201d according to a report from Brown Harris Stevens. The firm analyzed over 2,500 condo resales from July 2024 and July 2025 and found that one in three units sold during that time went for a loss.\nSellers who bought between 2016 and 2020 were hit the hardest, with more than half of those that sold in that last year suffering a loss. The vast majority of the more than 700 buyers from before 2010 that sold in the last year saw price appreciation.\nFor those tracking Manhattan pricing over the long term, the results may not come as a surprise. From 2016 to 2024, the\naverage price per square foot for a Manhattan condo\nhas fallen by 4 percent, according to Miller Samuel report for Douglas Elliman.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the public is completely aware of the fact that housing prices in Manhattan for the last decade have been relatively flat,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller.\nThe extended time horizon captures several inflection points that have shaped the Manhattan market.\nThe precedent to the lackluster resales was a period of \u201csuper normal growth\u201d from 2013 to 2015, according to Brown Harris Stevens managing director Jared Antin, before a surge in pricing \u201calmost overnight.\u201d From\n2015 to 2016, median condo sale prices\nincreased over 10 percent, according to Elliman\u2019s 10-year market report.\n\u201cThere was a lot of extrinsic pressure to buy, because you had this FOMO that if you didn\u2019t buy, prices were going to run away,\u201d Antin said. \u201cThat led people to make some potentially less than savvy purchase decisions.\u201d\n\nAs condo projects came to market, a slew of state and local policies dampened the city\u2019s appeal for wealthy buyers.\nThe introduction of the\ncap on state and local tax deductions in 2017\ndisproportionately focused on New Yorkers, who were subject to deductions nearly double that of the next highest county in the country. Two years later, the\ncity implemented a progressive mansion tax\nto replace its flat 1 percent tax on home sales. The mansion tax can stretch as high as 3.9 percent for the city\u2019s most expensive homes.\nBoth policies imposing steeper costs for high-end homebuyers, but the luxury market has seen the most consistent price appreciation. Just 20 percent of the homes in the study that sold for at least $10 million sold for a loss, and for homes bought from 2016 to 2020, the luxury segment was the only one to see price appreciation.\n\u201cYou\u2019re rich and you\u2019re buying because you want it,\u201d Antin said of the luxury market\u2019s resilient buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t really care about what\u2019s happening around you.\u201d\nNew York lost wealthy would-be buyers to low-tax, warm-weather states. From 2018 to 2022, roughly 125,000 New Yorkers moved to Florida and the percentage of millionaires living in the state fell to 8.7 percent from 12.7 percent from 2010 to 2022, according to a Citizen\u2019s Budget Commission report.\nThe trend cooled as the post-pandemic housing boom and skyrocketing insurance costs made South Florida a more expensive destination.\nThe stock market\u2019s unprecedented run over the last five years has also kept money out of New York real estate as investors have watched their bank accounts grow, but fears over a looming market correction have become more pervasive.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interesting pieces that are happening here that could help buoy the purchase market,\u201d Antin said.\n",

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani wants more rental vouchers, but as mayor would he actually make them easy to use? That takes administrative skill, attention to detail and doggedness.\nSo far, no mayor has been willing, let alone able, to reform the bureaucracy that causes apartments to fail inspection for the most infuriating reasons.\nAs one landlord\ntweeted\nthis week, \u201cI\u2019ve had a unit fail because of a single screw missing in a 4 screw window guard. The super was right there, proper tools, corrected the issue in 5 minutes. Nope, failed. Next available appointment for inspection was a month later.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeless Services claims that most reinspections occur within 72 hours. If that\u2019s true, it must be because landlords who are asked to wait longer say \u201cno thanks\u201d \u2014 and rent to someone without a voucher.\nRegardless, an inspector should never reject an apartment because of a missing screw that the superintendent replaced on the spot.\nIn another case, a unit failed inspection because a 79-cent\noutlet cover was cracked\n. Can you imagine? \u201cBack to the homeless shelter, people, this apartment is unsafe!\u201d\nThey are not unsafe dwellings, of course. They are perfectly legal for tenants without vouchers to rent, but not for tenants with vouchers. Think about that. The city discriminates against voucher holders \u2014 which is\nillegal for landlords\n.\nThis results in situations where a homeless mother with a 4-year-old kid finds a place she wants, and the landlord is willing to rent it to her, but cannot because the second bedroom is one floor plank short of 80 square feet.\nWhy not let the tenant sign a waiver allowing her to move into the apartment despite the 79-square-foot bedroom or the cracked, 79-cent outlet cover? These are not hazardous conditions.\nI\u2019m sure Mamdani would agree. But that doesn\u2019t mean, if elected, that he will hire a DHS commissioner capable of fixing it and that he will hold the commissioner\u2019s feet to the fire.\nThe other problem with being mayor is that a thousand other fires pop up and some of your original goals fall by the wayside.\nNo doubt some readers are saying, \u201cCuomo could fix the voucher problem.\u201d He has more experience getting things done than Mamdani, but Cuomo left a lot of things unfixed as governor.\nProperty taxes\n, for one.\nI once asked Cuomo, when he was governor, why he doesn\u2019t fix Labor Law 240, the infamous \u201cscaffold law,\u201d which makes insurance more expensive for public and private projects.\nThe governor answered that the law was strongly defended by the trial lawyers, which he called the most powerful lobby in Albany. Besides, he said, he focuses on a few priorities at a time, but the scaffold law was, like, eighth on the list. Meaning he wouldn\u2019t get to it.\nA governor or a mayor only has so much political capital and so much bandwidth. To fix a lot of problems at once requires delegating them to staff. Mike Bloomberg was a delegator. Cuomo was a micromanager.\n\nWhat would Mamdani be? Nobody knows.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIn response to a previous Daily Dirt, a reader opined, \u201cNo sane owner who understands the construction process will willingly landmark a property.\u201d The reader is a longtime real estate professional who sits on the board of a religious institution that was landmarked against its leaders\u2019 wishes. \u201cThe extra cost and time is significant even for the most simple items,\u201d the reader lamented. \u201cCar runs into your fence, [it takes] over a year to replace it.\u201d\nEver had a bad experience with the Landmarks Preservation Commission? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The early days of electrification generated a lot of opposition in New York City. In 1889, the mayor dispatched employees to remove wires from rooftops because he considered them ugly. New Yorkers cheered when electrical poles on Broadway were chopped down.\nElsewhere\u2026\nBecause a multifamily development\u2019s eligibility for 421a and 485x are determined by whether the footings are installed before or after June 15, 2022, to switch from the first tax abatement to its successor, developers would have to rip the footings out and put them back in.\nAs preposterous as that might sound, state law does not offer an alternative, said Daniel Bernstein, an attorney at Rosenberg &amp; Estis who deals with the tax abatements.\nFudging the installation dates of load-bearing elements is not advisable. A project\u2019s architect typically certifies the commencement date, but city officials check the building permit to ensure that it\u2019s consistent with the filing, Bernstein said.\nBecause 421a is more generous than 485x, the only reason a developer would switch is if the project misses the 421a\ncompletion deadline\n\u2014 which for affordability Option C is\nJune 15, 2026\n. The other 421a options \u2014 which require deeper affordability, but still not as deep as 485x \u2014 have a 2031 completion deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens with stalled 421a projects that cannot meet those deadlines for whatever reason,\u201d Bernstein said.\nTo avoid the absurdity of forcing a developer to remove and reinstall a foundation, state lawmakers could remove June 16, 2022, as the opening date of the 485x eligibility window. A fair question is why they included it in the first place.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$12.3 million\nfor a 2,783-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at ONE11 Residences, 111 West 56th Street in the Plaza District. Maria Mainieri, Taylor Middleton and Peter Evangelidis of Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$42.3 million\nfor 6201 and 6310 15th Avenue in Borough Park.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$6.5 million\nfor a 2,793-square-foot condominium unit at 60 Beach Street in Tribeca. Mark Jovanovic and the Paradigm Advisory team at Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 1,039,645-square-foot, 16-story jail at 125 White Street in Civic Center. Eric Van Epps of HOK Architects filed the permit on behalf of Eduardo del Valle of the NYC Department of Design and Construction.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Long considered a shoo-in for\none of three casino licenses up for grabs\nin New York, MGM Resorts has dropped out of the competition.\nThe company, which pitched a $2.3 billion expansion of its facility in Yonkers, announced Tuesday that it is withdrawing its proposal.\nThe news comes as a surprise, after a community advisory committee unanimously\napproved\nthe proposal last month. The casino, alongside another existing slot parlor, Queens Aqueduct Casino, seemed best positioned to snag two of the available state licenses, given that they already had operating facilities.\nBut in a statement, MGM blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d pointing to the fact that the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nAll of the remaining competitors are located in the outer boroughs: the Queens Aqueduct, Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park in Flushing and Bally\u2019s Bronx project.\nThe company also banked on receiving an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state\nlast week\n, the Yonkers proposal would only qualify for 15 years.\nThe length of the license coincides with how much an applicant is investing in the project. MGM pegged theirs at $2.3 billion, with $1.8 billion in capital investments.\n\n\u201cSince submitting our application in June, the competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our application have shifted, altering our return expectations on the proposed $2.3 billion investment,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nGiven these concerns, MGM also likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to propose competitive tax rates for the slot machines and table games. Each of the teams submitted rate proposals to the state on Tuesday. Resorts World pitched a 56 percent tax for slots and 30 percent for table games. Metropolitan Park\u2019s team proposed 25 percent for slots and 10 percent for table games. The documents submitted by Bally\u2019s were redacted.\nUnder the rules, in order to qualify for 30 years, an applicant would need to invest at least $10 billion. The projected investment in Resorts World\u2019s Queens Aqueduct is $7.5 billion; $8 billion for Metropolitan Park; and for Bally\u2019s, $4 billion.\nCrain\u2019s was\nfirst\nto report MGM\u2019s decision.\nLast month, community advisory committees whittled down the competition from\neight\nproposals to four. Now, the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board will review the applications, assessing them based on\nfour categories\n, including \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d which carries the most weight.\nThe board is expected to select licensees by Dec. 1. Though MGM\u2019s exit means three teams are now competing for three potential licenses, state Gaming Commission Chair Bill O\u2019Dwyer has made clear that the state does not have to award three licenses; it simply has the option to grant\nup to\nthree.\n",

It was last on the market in 2017 with a $129 million asking price, down from the\nlist price of $195 million\nin 2014, when it was the most expensive home for sale in the country.\nThe 53,000-square-foot home, at 9505 Lania Lane, has been a rental property for infrequent visitors like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. As a rental, it cost about $425,000 per year.\nThe seller is\nreal estate billionaire Jeff Greene\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest single property in Beverly Hills by far,\u201d Greene told the outlet. \u201cOnce you get to our gate, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a long, double-wide, meandering road through the vineyards up to the top. You are completely secure.\u201d\nThe 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property has a 15,000-square-foot entertainment wing with a 50-seat movie theater, a bowling alley and a disco with a rotating dance floor. The primary suite has a living room, two walk-in closets and a Turkish spa.\n\nThe 6-acre vineyard on the grounds produces cabernet sauvignon and sangiovese wine under the label Beverly Hills Vineyards, and a wine-tasting room has temperature-controlled storage for 10,000 bottles.\nOther nine-figure listings in SoCal include 10644 Bellagio Road in Bel Air, which is asking $190 million,\nper\nRealtor.com. The seven-bedroom mansion, known as\nCasa Encantada\n, is on an 8.4-acre property and features several dining rooms, orchards, a 60-foot tiled pool and a tennis pavilion.\nThe 18,400-square-foot property at 620 Arkell Drive in Beverly Hills is asking for $100 million. And a new-build at 3405 Fryman Road in Studio City, once the\nsite of Alex Trebek\u2019s home\n, is on the market for $42 million, as well as a Tuscan estate in Bel Air at 701 Nimes Road for just under $40 million.\nCloser to the beach, there\u2019s an 11,100-square-foot estate with Pacific Ocean views at 6 Mystique in Newport Coast on the market for $65 million. Ultra-luxury buyers can also look into a 13,600-square-foot estate at 670 Hot Springs Road in Montecito for $60 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Construction started in May on the 270-acre site, near the University of North Texas at Dallas and Interstate 20.\nCity Manager Kimberly Tolbert hinted the increase was forthcoming during a ceremonial groundbreaking this spring, WFAA\nreported\nat the time.\nPlans from the firm, headed by Mike Hoque, call for thousands of residential units, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and more than 50 acres of green space. The project could create a commercial hub in an area where the median income is about 60 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth average.\nThe Dallas-based firm\u2019s project has been riddled with\ndelays\n. The Dallas City Council approved amendments to the development agreement in December, extending deadlines and increasing the public subsidy to $35.9 million.\nThe firm\u2019s minimum investment requirement rose to $62 million, and it was tasked with selling an additional 50 lots to third-party builders.\nThat amounted to Hoque Global selling 580 lots in University Hills to D.R. Horton and Lennar for townhome and single-family development.\n\nA 60-day deadline to finalize the land purchase agreement and begin construction was met within days of the groundbreaking.\nHoque projects have stalled out in the past due to missing key milestones. The firm missed a deadline last year for vertical construction at its $50 million mixed-use project in Mansfield, but the city offered a\nsecond chance\n.\nFort Worth kicked the firm to the\ncurb\nlast year. It was removed as the master developer for the Evans and Rosedale Urban Village last April, after the city cited \u201cunacceptable delays.\u201d\nHoque did not reapply for the Urban Village project but contested those claims at the time.\nOther recent projects include partnering up with Mike Ablon on a Bank of America Plaza acquisition.\nHoque and PegasusAblon received initial\napproval\nlast month from Dallas city advisory boards for over $100 million in public incentives for a $409 million redevelopment of the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper at 901 Main Street.\nThe development duo aims to convert parts of the 1.9 million-square-foot building into hotel, event, and retail space, and add a new parking structure.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Weeks after the Boca Raton City Council agreed to wait for a voter referendum on Terra and Frisbie Group\u2019s proposed government campus redevelopment, the battle over the project is heating up.\nLocal attorney Ned Kimmelman filed suit against Save Boca, the group leading opposition to the project, and its founder, Jon Pearlman, earlier this week. The suit, filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeks an emergency injunction to invalidate the petitions circulated by Save Boca in the referendum efforts, filings show. Save Boca collected 7,000 signed petitions opposing the project.\nIn the suit, Kimmelman, a Boca Raton resident, accuses Save Boca and Pearlman of spreading misinformation to \u201cinduce people/voters to sign the petition.\u201d\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the suit alleges. Save Boca and Pearlman are seeking an amendment to Boca Raton\u2019s city charter that would prevent the council from selling or leasing land greater than half an acre, something the suit says would cause an \u201cunworkable, very expensive\u201d government crisis.\nKimmelman could not be immediately reached for comment. Pearlman also did not respond to an immediate request for comment.\nThe government campus redevelopment proposal at the heart of the issue is called One Boca, led by\nDavid Martin\u2019s\nTerra and the Frisbie family\u2019s namesake\nFrisbie Group\n. It is slated to include city offices, apartments, condos and retail on public land in downtown Boca Raton. This would include redeveloping the existing city hall at 201 West Palmetto Road. The proposal includes a 99-year lease of public land to Terra and Frisbie.\n\nAt a Sept. 9 meeting, the city\ncouncil voted to delay approval\nof the project\u2019s 99-year land lease until after a voter referendum on the project. Terra and Frisbie\nbeat out Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross\n, New York-based Namdar Group, and Atlanta-based RocaPoint Partners in a bidding process that concluded in February.\nAt a city council workshop on Tuesday concerning One Boca, Frisbie partner Rob Frisbie Jr. confirmed the developers would have new plans to present at city meetings on Oct. 27 and 28. The scope is being reduced from the previously planned 30 acres.\nSupporters of Save Boca attending the meeting decried the project as a betrayal of public trust, a land grab, and raised concerns about gopher tortoise habitat. One Save Boca supporter invoked Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d anti-drug campaign in his plea to the city council.\nFrisbie said his team has been conducting community meetings to address concerns from the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in the design phase where we\u2019re listening and incorporating additional feedback from the community,\u201d he said, adding that the developers are focused on enhancing Boca Raton\u2019s Memorial Park in the next set of plans.\nFollowing the Oct. 27 and 28 meetings, the proposal will go to a voter referendum on Mar. 10, 2026.",

        "content": "Let me know if this sounds familiar:\nPrivately owned multifamily buildings constructed decades ago in New York City are falling apart because residents are not paying enough each month to maintain them.\nRings a bell, doesn\u2019t it?\nHere\u2019s more:\nLawmakers recognize the problem and are springing into action. To bring these buildings into a state of good repair while keeping them affordable for hardworking New Yorkers, city and state officials are coming to the rescue with tens of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d you say. \u201cThat is not happening. They haven\u2019t done squat for rent-stabilized buildings!\u201d\nIndeed they haven\u2019t. But I was not referring to rent-stabilized buildings, which Albany has left to crumble by starving them of revenue while their already-high property taxes somehow keep rising.\nRather, there is another kind of property that, in stark contrast, occupies a special place in lawmakers\u2019 hearts: Mitchell-Lama co-ops.\nSince Gov. Hochul took office, she has showered Mitchell-Lamas across the state with nearly $500 million. That\u2019s\u00a0 $4,762 per unit, on average, but some have received much more. One agency alone has gifted $265 million to 24,000 Mitchell-Lama apartments \u2014 more than $11,000 apiece.\nHad the governor doled out money at the same rate to New York City\u2019s 966,000 rent-stabilized units, the total would have come to $4.6 billion.\nIn the spring, Hochul and state legislators passed a budget that cut taxes for Mitchell-Lamas in half, saving them $50 million a year. But that didn\u2019t apply to an \u201cArticle V\u201d co-op known as Penn South.\n\nThe Manhattan property\u2019s shareholders have kept their maintenance fees too low to actually take care of the building. That might sound harsh, because some residents \u2014 we don\u2019t know how many \u2014 probably can\u2019t afford to pay more.\nBut housing has to be paid for. It doesn\u2019t fix itself, heat itself, paint itself or insure itself. So the state is letting the city give Penn South a $2 million annual tax cut.\n\u201cI commend the governor for recognizing the sky-high costs to operate housing and her work to help Mitchell Lama buildings across the city from choosing between deferred maintenance or double-digit rate increases,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cI can only hope the same approach and attention is offered to the nearly 2 million residents living in rent-stabilized housing.\u201d\nRead that last sentence closely and you might pick up a hint of sarcasm. Burgos knows the state has barely lifted a finger for his members\u2019 buildings since essentially freezing their rents in 2019.\nMitchell-Lamas are often hailed as a triumph of Albany, which established the middle-class co-ops in 1955. But as it turned out, they were\nnot sustainable\n. That\u2019s why city and state lawmakers have been running from building to building, plugging holes in the dike with\ntax dollars from everyone else\n.\nThese cash infusions are always portrayed in press releases and fawning media coverage as acts of altruism by elected officials, rather than as bailouts of buildings whose shareholders deferred maintenance so they could save money \u2014 in some cases out of necessity, in others to\nbuy a condo in Florida\n.\nTo be fair, the midcentury legislators who crafted the program, Manhattan Sen. MacNeil Mitchell and Brooklyn Assembly member Aldred Lama, gave these co-ops the option to eventually become market-rate, which would allow them to pay their own bills. But when offered free money by the government to stay in the program, many take it.\nHochul was at it again Tuesday, summoning the media to Manhattan\u2019s Penn South to watch her sign a bill from Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly member Tony Simone to let the city slash its property taxes.\n\u201cPenn South faces rising operational costs, which threaten to impact building quality and future affordability for its residents,\u201d Hochul\u2019s press release said.\nThat is also true for rent-stabilized buildings, except that the rising costs only threaten building quality, not rents. But the state expects landlords to shoulder those costs, and if they can\u2019t, there\u2019s a fallback plan. It\u2019s called foreclosure.\n",

        "content": "After launching construction on a prominent office development without a tenant publicly in place, BXP appears to have found its first taker at 343 Madison Avenue.\nGlobal insurance and investment firm C.V. Starr is\nin agreement\nto lease roughly a third of the 1-million-square-foot development. Further details of the deal were not disclosed and the companies have not commented on the alleged deal, first reported in the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nThe insurance firm previously\nrenewed\nroughly 140,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue in 2016 and expanded by another 71,000 square feet. That office building is also owned by BXP, previously known as Boston Properties.\nThe development site at 343 Madison is a prominent Manhattan project, as BXP is building its 46-story tower with connections to Grand Central Terminal. Still, it\u2019s rare for projects of this size to commence without a large amount of the space pre-leased.\nBXP reportedly had\na letter of intent\nin place with a tenant to take 30 percent of the building\u2019s leasable square footage as of early last month; presumably, C.V. Starr is that tenant.\n\nThe development of 343 Madison has already been fraught with financial challenges. Last month, BXP\nlowered its dividend\nby 30 percent to help pay for the\n$2 billion office tower\n, searching for $50 million in savings on a quarterly basis.\nThe development site of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s former headquarters suffered a blow this summer when Norges Bank\nbacked out of a plan to be a 45 percent partner\nin the project.\nSince then, BXP has been searching for a partner to pick up as much as half of the development cost, which CEO Owen Thomas has said would help land a $1 billion construction loan. The CEO said that BXP\u2019s costs could drop to $500 million under that scenario.\nThe company is also looking to raise $1 billion by selling land and office properties in suburban locations, preparing to finance its project without a partner.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A slumping South Florida office market has some landlords and developers seeking exit strategies.\nAsking rents tumbled in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties in the third quarter, as demand for office space plateaued compared to the same period of last year, a JLL report shows.\nMeanwhile, a handful of distressed properties traded, as some owners sought to cut their losses. For instance, developer\nMichael Shvo\nlast month sold his assemblage at 1656-1680 Alton Road in Miami Beach, including the former Epicure Gourmet Market &amp; Cafe building, for $28.2 million to New York-based Infinity Collective.\nIn 2022, Shvo paid $39.3 million for the properties that he planned to redevelop into The Alton, a planned six-story building with about 17,000 square feet of office space and five apartments. Shvo told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the office project was \u201cno longer the highest and best use for this site.\u201d\nIn another sign of trouble in South Florida\u2019s office market, New York-based R&amp;B Realty lost\nGateway at Wynwood\n, a 12-story office and retail building at 2916 North Miami Avenue, after failing to secure refinancing on a delinquent $112.9 million mortgage. San Diego-based Cire Equity acquired Gateway at Wynwood after purchasing the $89.6 million credit bid from A10 Capital, a lender that won the property at a bankruptcy auction.\nA few bright spots in the third quarter included\nPlayboy\ninking a lease in August for a 20,000-square-foot penthouse at The Rivani, a mixed-use building in Miami Beach owned by real estate investor Robert Rivani.\nPlayboy\nplans to relocate its headquarters from Beverly Hills to South Beach next year, but with a caveat. If the city of Miami Beach does not provide $800,000 in incentives, Playboy can cancel the deal.\nMiami-Dade County\nThe average asking rent in Miami-Dade County dropped to $65.89 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $66.33 a square foot during the same period of last year, the JLL report shows. The vacancy rate remained relatively unchanged at 15.8 percent, compared to 15.5 percent, year-over-year. New construction also slowed a bit in the third quarter to 971,000 square feet, compared to 1.1 million square feet under construction during the same period of last year.\n\nThe third quarter\u2019s largest lease was Miami-based law firm Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff &amp; Sitterson renewing its agreement for 96,800 square feet at\nMuseum Tower,\na 28-story office tower in downtown Miami owned by Moishe Mana.\nIn Wynwood, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\ninked a lease for 25,200 square feet at Wynwood Plaza, a nearly completed mixed-use project.\nBroward County\nLandlords in Broward County experienced a boost in the average asking rent to $48.54 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $42.93 a square foot during the same period of last year, according to JLL. Like Miami-Dade, the vacancy rate in Broward hasn\u2019t moved up or down, staying the same, year-over-year, at 15.9 percent. New construction was also stagnant. In the third quarter, Broward had 340,000 square feet under construction, compared to 354,000 square feet during the same period of last year.\nWhile Broward didn\u2019t have any standout lease signings in the third quarter, the county\u2019s office market did see a flurry of end users opting to buy office space. Among the deals was Richardson, Texas-based Lennox Industries\u2019\n$16 million\npurchase of a 30,000-square-foot building in Fort Lauderdale for the company\u2019s Southeast U.S. headquarters.\nPalm Beach County\nRecently fueled by billionaire Steve Ross\u2019 big bet on West Palm Beach\u2019s office market, Palm Beach County is also experiencing a slowdown.\nThe average asking rent in the county dipped to $68.81 a square foot in the third quarter, compared to $70.69 a square foot during the same period of last year, the JLL report shows. The vacancy rate also climbed to 14.4 percent, compared to 13.2 percent, year-over-year. But Palm Beach County is still experiencing a robust development pipeline with 1.1 million square feet under construction in the third quarter, the same as in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe most notable lease signing took place at\n10 CityPlace\n, one of the new office towers in West Palm Beach developed by Ross\u2019 Related Ross. ServiceNow, a cloud computing company, signed a lease to occupy 200,000 square feet, nearly half the space at 10 CityPlace.",

The firm specializes in long-term multifamily investments, according to its website.\nThe property, which is in Du Page County, fits into\nDenver-based Highland\u2019s\ninvestment criteria because it\u2019s a low supply market with a steady population and strong job growth.\nChicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market has been on fire, while once-hot regions like the\nSun Belt cool off\namid oversupply.\n\nThe 1970s-era property also presents an opportunity for rent growth, according to JLL marketing materials. Investors have been circling Du Page county because of its proximity to Chicago without\nthe unpredictable nature of Cook County property taxes\n.\nThe property was 95 percent occupied when it listed and had a 77 percent average retention rate over the past three years. JLL\u2019s Kevin Girard, Mark Stern and Zachary Kaufman represented the seller.\nThe sale, which closed last week, comes on the heels of another suburban multifamily sale in the southwest suburb of Justice.\nChicago-based Waterton sold the Oaks and Laurels of Willow Hill, a 749-unit suburban\napartment community in Justice\nto Santa Monica, California-based Turner Impact Capital, public records show. The sale of that complex, which is about 20 miles southwest of Chicago, came out to about $110,000 per unit.\nBender is still adding to its portfolio as well. A year ago, the company bought the\nArrive at Town Center\n, an 85-unit apartment complex with 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail in north suburban Vernon Hills, from California-based firm FPA Multifamily.",

Adjusted for inflation, the asking represents a loss from the purchase price. But the listing is the most expensive for a co-op in the city, according to StreetEasy.\nThe duplex includes 2,200 square feet of terraces, a living room with a fireplace and views of Central Park, a primary suite with a dressing room and a library with a bar and high ceilings.\nThe 19-story, 109-unit Art Deco building was constructed in 1930 and received pop culture attention for serving as the Shandor Building in the 1984 supernatural comedy. Amenities at the building include a children\u2019s playroom and a roof deck.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Alan Nickman and Stephen O\u2019Neal share the\nlisting\nwith a Compass team including Allison Chiaramonte.\n\nAvenue Capital launched in 1995 and manages more than $10 billion in assets across the globe. Lasry also partnered on the purchase of a stake in the Bucks for $550 million in 2014. In 2023 \u2014 two years after the Bucks ended a half-century championship drought \u2014 Lasry sold his stake to the Haslams in a deal valuing the franchise at $3.5 billion.\nIn 2019, the billionaire\nsold a $9.5 million\n, one-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at 812 Fifth Avenue to William Reeves, co-founder of hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management.\nThe year prior, Lasry sold his six-story townhouse at 4 East 74th Street\nfor $31.5 million\nto an anonymous buyer. It was originally listed for $39 million and later chopped to $35 million, but it\u2019s unclear how much Lasry bought it for in the first place.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The project, called\nMetropolitan Park\n, is vying for a state gaming license.\nMeanwhile, Cohen\u2019s residence at 901 Oxford Way, which is listed for $35 million, was last week\u2019s top home to go into contract based on asking price, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n. The listing equates to $2,764 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s discounted from the $45 million, or $3,553 per square foot, the home was asking back in May.\nCohen\n, the founder of S.A.C. Capital Advisors and Point72 Asset Management, bought the residence in 2015, according to\nForbes\n. Spec developer Gala Asher was the seller at the time, according to the deed.\nProperty and state records show the home\u2019s owner as a Delaware limited liability company called Crown West, which is managed by Point 72 chief investment officer Andrew B. Cohen and also tied to the same address as the financial firm.\nThe nine-bedroom, 13-bathroom home spans 12,700 square feet. It\u2019s close to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Among the home\u2019s many amenities are a living room bar, elevator, private space to take meetings, waterfall, spa, game room and underground parking.\n\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass has the listing.\nIt was a big week for Glass, who also holds the listing of Los Angeles County\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, along with Compass\u2019 Alexandra Glass.\nThat\u2019s for the home at 1535 Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills, which is listed for just under $27 million, or $2,268 per square foot.\nThe L-shaped home, which is being sold by a trust, was built in 2021 and has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms across nearly 12,000 square feet.\nHighlights include a half-Olympic length pool, spa, 150-year-old olive trees and both city and ocean views.\nTwenty-nine homes in L.A. County went into contract last week, which was one more deal than a year ago, according to the roundup produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team. The report counts homes appearing in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nTotal asking volume was $252.9 million, which was a jump of nearly 47 percent from the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson is preparing to bring back one of Chicago\u2019s most controversial revenue tools \u2014 the corporate head tax \u2014 as the city faces a projected $1.15 billion shortfall next year.\nThat\u2019s according to sources familiar with his upcoming budget proposal, Crain\u2019s first\nreported\n.\nThe\ntax\n, enacted in 1973 and eliminated under Rahm Emanuel in 2014, charged companies with 50 employees or more $4 per worker per month, according to the nonpartisan\nTax Foundation\nas well as the\nInstitute for the Public Good\n, which produced a policy paper in September in support of the proposal.\nThe concept has been derided by the city\u2019s business community as an anti-growth penalty. The\nIllinois Policy\nInstitute came out against the head tax, as well as the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this\nsummer\n.\nJohnson, who will unveil his third spending plan this week, appears ready to test that argument.\nWhile Johnson has repeatedly vowed to make the wealthy and big corporations \u201cput more skin in the game,\u201d his options are narrow. State law bars the city from extending the sales tax to services or imposing a local corporate income tax, leaving him with politically fraught levers like a head tax, higher cloud-computing levies, or inflation-tied hikes to city fines and fees.\nThe mayor\u2019s allies have floated a range of proposals.\n\nThe Institute for the Public Good proposed a tenfold increase to the previous head tax to $40 per employee on large companies, potentially bringing in tens of millions in annual\nrevenue\nand also to bring inflation-adjusted and full-time employee equivalent fees up to par with the impact the $4 head tax had in 1973.\nProgressive Caucus members floated lower sticker prices. Johnson\u2019s team is said to be eyeing a lower rate, aware that he\u2019ll need at least 26 City Council votes to pass a budget that already faces pushback from moderates and business groups.\nCorporate leaders are bracing for a fight.\nThe Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce warned that another tax on employers would discourage hiring and drive investment elsewhere.\n\u201cAdding additional taxes on businesses to fill the budget gap will disincentivize businesses from employing people in Chicago,\u201d CEO Jack Lavin said in a statement. Illinois Policy Institute suggested spending caps, fixing pension debt and other cuts to reign in the budget deficit.\nThe business pushback comes as the administration also weighs extending a citywide hiring freeze and trimming departmental budgets by up to 5 percent. Unions, meanwhile, are lobbying to prevent layoffs and pressing aldermen to embrace new revenue sources instead.\nJohnson\u2019s challenge echoes last year\u2019s bruising budget fight, when his proposed\nproperty tax increase collapsed\nbefore a final vote.\n",

Another 80 residences will be constructed for residents 55 and older.\nThe housing will be priced for low-income and very-low income individuals earning 30 percent to 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income, or between\n$33,600 and $87,550\nfor one person.\nThe project site houses a 10,000-square-foot office property, Sunset Development\u2019s service center, which will be torn down. The site is across from City Village, a 404-townhome development from SummerHill Homes, which is under construction.\nAmenities include a technology center, career and school resource center, barbecue and picnic areas, bicycle parking, children\u2019s play areas and co-working areas for adults. The senior residences will have a fitness center, technology center and outdoor deck. There will also be a central communal courtyard, dog park and community garden with direct access to Iron Horse Trail.\nThe development is \u201can investment in San Ramon\u2019s future as an inclusive, sustainable community,\u201d said\nAlex Mehran Jr.\n, CEO of Sunset Development. The development is \u201cespecially critical for families and seniors in a region that is growing rapidly and urgently needs more affordable homes,\u201d said Linda Mandolini, president and CEO of Eden Housing.\n\nThis is the latest instance of offices being replaced with housing as part of the grand plan to transform the office complex into a mixed-use neighborhood. The effort has been helped in part by companies like Chevron cutting their office space at Bishop Ranch in recent years.\nIn June, Sunset Development filed formal development applications to gut 761,000 square feet of office space to make way for two residential communities, adding 485 units of housing as part of the endeavor to\nbuild 8,000 units\non site.\nThat proposal calls for demolishing the three-building, 652,000-square-foot Canopy office complex and building a 412-unit residential community of 255 detached townhomes and a 157-unit five-story apartment building.\nOf the 412 units, 62 will be deed-restricted affordable housing with at least 22 reserved for very-low-income households. Sunset also submitted plans to build 73 housing units at 2 Annabel Lane to replace a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units.\nSunset plans to\nturn the old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\nOther housing projects at Bishop Ranch in the works include Related California\u2019s 380-unit luxury apartment building at 6201 Bollinger Canyon Road and\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A judge temporarily halted the planned transfer of a valuable downtown Miami parcel slated for President Donald Trump\u2019s future presidential library, intervening in a high-profile land deal involving public property.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz issued the temporary injunction on Tuesday, the\nAssociated Press\nreported. The injunction will remain in effect until Ruiz issues a final verdict or Miami Dade College holds a new, publicly noticed meeting to discuss the transfer of the land.\nRuiz sided with Miami activist Marvin Dunn, who on Oct. 6 sued Miami Dade College, alleging the school violated Florida\u2019s open government laws by failing to give adequate public notice before approving the land transfer to the state last month.\nRuiz noted that the college \u201cdidn\u2019t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote,\u201d but emphasized the case was \u201cnot rooted in politics.\u201d\nThe nearly 3-acre property at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n, valued at about $67 million by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser, sits on one of the few remaining undeveloped stretches in\ndowntown Miami\n.\nReal estate analysts said the site \u2014 surrounded by luxury condo towers, two museums and two waterfront parks \u2014 could fetch several times its assessed value if sold on the open market.\n\nThe college\u2019s board of trustees voted during an early morning meeting on Sept. 23 to convey the land to a state fund overseen by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. A week later, the governor and cabinet voted to transfer the parcel to the foundation that will develop\nTrump\u2019s library.\nThat group is led by\nEric Trump\n, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley.\nAttorneys for Dunn argued that the Sept. 23 meeting agenda gave no details about the location or purpose of the transaction. Miami Dade College\u2019s lawyers insisted the board followed legal requirements, and that any delay in transferring the land could cost the college up to $300,000.\nOther Florida universities, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, were previously considered for the library site. State lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation to shield such projects from local government objections.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado\n",

        "content": "Nicki Minaj is in danger of losing her Barbie dream house.\nThe rapper\u2019s\nLos Angeles-area mansion\nis at risk of being sold off due to a sizable unpaid debt that she and her husband, Kenneth Petty, have refused to pay, Us Weekly\nreported\n.\nThe potential seizure stems from a 2019 alleged assault case involving Petty and a security guard, Thomas Weidenmuller, who worked at one of Minaj\u2019s shows in\nGermany\n. Weidenmuller was awarded $503,000 by a court from Minaj and Petty, though he reportedly has yet to receive it. That led to the security guard asking the court on Oct. 6 to order Minaj\u2019s home to be sold to help him collect the money he is owed.\nMinaj owns an 11-bedroom, 16-bathroom\nhome in Hidden Hills\nspanning 11,820 square feet. She purchased it in December 2022 for $19.5 million.\nWeidenmuller said in his motion that he believes the home is worth enough to pay off the\nmortgage\n, liens and the debt he is owed. The plaintiff said that Minaj has a $13.3 million mortgage lien on the home and a \u201c$722,151 homestead exemption \u2014 together just under $14 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe property\u2019s current fair market value is appraised at $20 million, yielding approximately $6 million in equity beyond the lien and exemption. That amount is more than sufficient to satisfy the judgment, plus accrued interest and enforcement costs,\u201d Weidenmuller said.\nWeidenmuller alleged that while working at Minaj\u2019s show on March 22, 2019, a fan broke through the security barrier and was able to get on stage with Minaj. She allegedly became upset with the security team, leading him to tell Petty about what happened. When Weidenmuller entered Minaj\u2019s dressing room, he reportedly was greeted by Minaj, Petty and two security guards, and Petty \u201cwithout warning\u201d struck him in the face. The security guard was rushed to the hospital and doctors determined he suffered serious injuries and required surgery to fix his jaw.\nThe security guard is pursuing the seizure after Minaj and Petty failed to respond to his lawsuit, prompting the court to enter default judgments against the couple in March of last year.\n\u201cAlthough it is regrettable that the extraordinary measure of forcing the sale of Minaj\u2019s dwelling is required, that result is entirely the product of her intransigence in not making payment,\u201d Weidenmuller\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cMinaj is a global music superstar, estimated to have a net worth of anywhere between $150 [million and] 190 million, and is reportedly the highest paid female rap star in the world. There is little doubt that she is highly capable of paying the judgment in full and, yet, she has refused to do so despite multiple written requests for payment and levies served upon several of her suspected creditors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is facing a revolt from lenders over its latest debt proposal, a standoff that could ripple far beyond Wall Street \u2014 all the way to Chicago\u2019s pension funds.\nA group of creditors banded together to block the casino operator\u2019s plan to amend roughly $1.9 billion in term loans Tuesday, Bloomberg\nreported\n, raising fresh doubts about the company\u2019s ability to finance its long-delayed\nChicago resort\n.\nThe junk-rated firm failed to win lender support by last week\u2019s deadline, with investors uneasy about the value of the properties securing the debt and the pace of future repayments.\nAt the center of the dispute is\nBally\u2019s\nattempt to reclassify its under-construction Chicago casino as loan collateral while also seeking approval to sell and lease back its Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort in Rhode Island for $735 million.\nBally\u2019s has said it would use about $500 million from that sale to pay down senior secured debt, including portions of its revolving credit and term loan, trimming first-lien obligations to about $1.94 billion.\nBut creditors want more detail on how the company intends to manage cash and repay debt after recent repayments to Apollo Global Management \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among some investors.\n\nThe dissenting lenders, advised by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, have questioned the declining value of the company\u2019s property collateral and are pressing for new guarantees tied to Bally\u2019s 58 percent stake in Greek gaming company Intralot, acquired through a deal completed earlier this month.\nThe stalemate is a critical obstacle to Bally\u2019s push to extend at least $600 million in term-loan maturities to 2030. Lenders on its revolving facility have already agreed to the extension, arranged by Deutsche Bank, but the broader amendment remains in limbo. Bally\u2019s term loan slid to about 90 cents on the dollar this week, down from 95 on Friday, reflecting mounting investor anxiety.\nFor Chicago, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. The city is counting on the long-promised Bally\u2019s casino \u2014 approved in 2022 and expected to generate hundreds of millions for its underfunded pension systems \u2014 to advance beyond its temporary\nRiver North\nsite.\nBally\u2019s\ninsists its balance sheet is \u201cfantastic,\u201d citing more than $1 billion in cash and credit access. Unless the stalemate breaks, the company\u2019s financing gamble could leave Chicago\u2019s casino dreams on hold.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Owned by classic car enthusiasts active in local restoration clubs, the home includes a 6,200-square-foot showroom attached to the 12,500-square-foot home.\nThe property also includes an\nequestrian\nbarn that can accommodate four horses.\nThe sellers listed the home for $5.9 million last July and have modestly reduced the price several times since then. It is one of the most-expensive homes on the market in\nMcKinney\n, a Collin County suburb about 30 miles north of Dallas.\n\nHolly and Andi Haven of Real Broker have the listing, and Florida-based\nElite Auctions\nis handling the auction. Elite has held auctions for other North Texas homes, but this is the company\u2019s first in McKinney. It will take place on site at 11 a.m. Nov. 7.\nMany sellers turn to auctions after exhausting the conventional listing process. Elite Auctions has seen a threefold increase in auction candidates this year, CEO Randy Haddaway said. That might be fueled by a\nsoftening of the luxury market\n, especially in the\nSun Belt\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inventory that needs to be cleaned up around the country,\u201d Haddaway said.\nNationally, luxury sellers are pulling back from the market, according to\nRedfin\n. While some markets have been hit harder, Texas is among those slowing down.\nAustin\n, once a tech boomtown, had one of the highest seller-to-buyer ratios in the country during the hot season, with inventory especially high in the luxury condo class.\nRelistings are taking up an increasingly high share of the state\u2019s ultra-luxury inventory\n, mostly concentrated in Houston and Dallas.\nThe most recent headliner auction in the area was a Southlake mansion at 1469 Sunshine Lane. Previously listed for $27.5 million, the\nhome\u2019s winning bid was $14.22 million\n, less than the expected starting bid.",

        "content": "SL Green is buying the Park Avenue Tower in the Plaza District for $730 million.\nMarc Holiday\u2019s REIT just went into contract to buy the 36-story tower at 65 East 55th Street from the Blackstone Group, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe price tag is a discount to the roughly $925 million that Blackstone put into acquiring and renovating the building since 2014. Investors have come off the sidelines in recent months seeking out bargains on office buildings, particularly in the Plaza District where demand from tenants has created a hot market for available office space.\nSL Green moved quickly on the tower once it hit the market and preempted other bids, according to a source familiar.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and Blackstone could not be immediately reached for comment. An Eastdil Secured team led by Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the sale.\nThe largest tenant is PineBridge Investments, the asset manager acquired last year by MetLife for $1.2 billion, which occupies about 75,000 square feet. Other major tenants include the investment bank BTIG, the venture capital firm Raine Group and a division of the Creative Artists Agency.\n\nBlackstone bought the building for\n$750 million\nin 2014 from Shorenstein Properties.\nIt was actually the second time the company owned the property. It had originally acquired the tower in 2007 as part of its takeover of Sam Zell\u2019s Equity Office Properties, and then quickly flipped the building and six others to Harry Macklowe.\nMacklowe lost the property to his lender, Deutsche Bank, which sold it and another office building (850 Third Avenue) for $930 million to Shorenstein in 2008.\nAfter two major tenants left in 2016, Blackstone spent about $170 million to renovate the building, including a new lobby, mechanical updates and converting the basement into an amenity space.\nThe private equity firm had put the building up for sale in 2019, eyeing a price tag of\n$800 million\n, but no final deal materialized. It refinanced the property last year with a\n$309 million\nCMBS loan originated by Morgan Stanley.\nSL Green, meanwhile, has been active in the market looking for deals. The company last month went into contract to buy the former Brooks Brothers building on Madison Avenue, where it plans to build its next ground-up office tower. It was also recently in the bidding for Paramount Group, and expressed interest in acquiring the Chrysler Building.\n",

        "content": "Crescent Heights scored a $238.4 million refinancing for the luxury 588-unit Forma Miami apartment tower in Edgewater.\nThe deal marks a continuing lending flurry in South Florida, despite elevated interest rates.\nCrescent Heights \u2013\u2013 led by Russell Galbut, Sonny Kahn and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 completed the 40-story Forma at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami last year, according to records. It includes 85,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities and a 50,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market.\nThe fixed-rate refinancing was provided via Freddie Mac\u2019s Lease-up program, according to a Walker &amp; Dunlop news release. Aaron Appel and Jonathan Schwartz were part of the Walker &amp; Dunlop team that represented Crescent Heights.\nThe Freddie Mac Lease-up program targets multifamily properties that are approaching stabilization, but haven\u2019t achieved it yet. Generally, more than 90 percent of units have to be leased for a property to be considered stabilized.\nForma is already stabilized, but wasn\u2019t when it initially applied for the refinancing, according to Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Michael Stepniewski, who also represented Crescent Heights.\nGalbut said the tower is 97 percent leased.\n\nDesigned by Rockwell Group and Arquitectonica, Forma offers studios and one- to three-bedroom units with condo level finishes, the Walker &amp; Dunlop news release says.\nApartments.com\nshows monthly rents range from $3,080 to $7,515.\nCrescent Heights owns 9 acres of properties next to Forma that it plans to develop into a city center, the release says.\nIn other recent refinancings, Treo Group scored\n$132 million\nthis month for its two-building Vox I and II student housing campus with 262 units, combined, at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue in South Miami. Midtown Capital scored a\n$57 million\nbridge loan last month for its 230-unit Astor Sound apartment complex that it\u2019s developing at 2253 Keast Lane in Lake Worth Beach.\nIn August, Acre landed\n$72 million\nto refinance its 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay at 6445 Northeast Seventh Avenue in Miami\u2019s MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market is experiencing a supply overhang following a construction boom. A pandemic-era influx of out-of-staters fueled unprecedented demand and record rent growth, prompting developers to jump on new projects. Last year, they completed a record\n18,600 apartments\nin South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. This led to lower rents and more concessions.\nDevelopers still are starting new projects, arguing that by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027, demand will be restored.\nOak Row Equities is developing the 324-unit\n2900 Terrace\non the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. In the Miami Design District, Miami Design District Associates, which includes Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, Hunter Pasteur and The Forbes Company, scored a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan in June for the 107-unit Cassi apartment project at 91-93 Northeast 36th Street.\n",

        "content": "A Kenilworth home a few blocks from the beach approached the high watermark for non-lakefront sales in the village, days after another property\nset a likely record\nfor inland sales in Kenilworth.\nThe house at 207 Cumberland Avenue sold for $5.9 million Tuesday, according to a social media post from listing agent Jena Radnay. The nine bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom house is situated a short walk from the beach on the north end of Kenilworth. It spans 9,600 square feet and sits on a 0.76-acre lot.\nThe price pencils out to $615 per square foot.\nThe sale followed a $6.1 million deal last week for a gutted and modernized historic house on Kenilworth Road. That transaction, brokered by @properties\u2019 John Mawicke, appears to be the most-expensive non-lakefront home sale in the village in several years, and the Cumberland Avenue property is not far behind.\nIt went under contract a little more than a month after it was listed in July, reflecting high demand for luxury housing in the North Shore, even outside the top-tier lakefront properties.\n\u201cIt just shows you that the values are very high for a 3,000-resident village,\u201d Radnay told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRadnay, an @properties agent and major broker for North Shore lakefront properties, said she\u2019s seeing interest from buyers in Chicago and out of town who want to move to the North Shore. With inventory in such short supply, buyers are turning their attention from the most-expensive cities like Winnetka and bringing more competition into Kenilworth.\nThe Cumberland Avenue house last sold in 2013 for $4.2 million. The house was owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity, but property tax bills were addressed to Jason Hanold, according to public records, which indicate the previous owners paid $74,000 in property taxes in 2023.\n\nThe property was listed in July for $6.5 million. Sale records that might identify the buyers are not yet available.\nRadnay has another Kenilworth listing, a lakeshore property on Sheridan Road,\nasking $15 million that is under contract\n. That asking price would break the village record for a lakefront property of $11.75 million set in 2020, but the final sale price is not yet known. Radnay said she expects the deal to close by the end of the year.\nIn September, a lakefront Kenilworth mansion that was expected to be a teardown\nsold for $6.8 million\nto developer Leo Birov of Heritage Luxury Homes. Birov is\nmarketing a $6 million spec\nmansion on part of the site, and it\u2019s likely another new construction is in the works for the other portion of the property.\nThe recent sales show the hot streak for North Shore luxury properties isn\u2019t slowing down.\nA few dozen homes have sold for more than $4 million along the North Shore this year,\nwith Winnetka leading the pack in luxury deals\n. A 13,900 square-foot mansion previously owned by a former Goldman Sachs executive \u2014 also listed by Radnay \u2014\nsold in September for $31.3 million\n, the highest Chicagoland home resale price ever recorded.\nThe lack of inventory is driving competition, Radnay said.\nLike the house on Cumberland Avenue, many luxury properties that recently sold or have pending contracts in the North Shore have gone under contract in a matter of weeks, in some cases within a few days.\n\u201cUntil our inventory changes, we\u2019re going to be staying at this exact same temperature for a while,\u201d Radnay said.\n",

        "content": "In the latest land grab of the AI infrastructure boom, a\nNvidia-backed\nstartup is joining forces with cloud computing heavyweight CoreWeave to build a sprawling, self-powered data center complex in West Texas.\nPoolside, an AI company focused on next-gen code generation, plans to construct the 500-acre facility \u2014 dubbed Horizon \u2014 on a portion of the Mitchell family\u2019s Longfellow Ranch, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe site sits atop the Permian Basin, America\u2019s busiest oil field, and will use natural gas produced on-site to power the operation, a growing trend among AI firms seeking more control over their infrastructure amid soaring demand and constrained chip supply.\nThe Horizon project lands amid consolidation across the data-center sector.\nPlano-based Aligned Data Centers, which operates 50 campuses across the Americas, was recently sold to a BlackRock- and Nvidia-backed consortium in a\n$40 billion deal\n, one of the largest in the industry\u2019s history, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nPoolside and\nCoreWeave\nplan to build a data center capable of generating its own electricity, an unusual move in a sector where power access has become a critical choke point.\n\nAnother emerging player in West Texas, Rick Perry\u2019s\nFermi\nReal Estate Investment Trust signature project, \u201cProject Matador,\u201d is a 5,000-acre advanced energy and intelligence campus aiming to attract data center and hyperscaler tenants, with plans for 11 gigawatts of power by 2038 from natural gas, solar and nuclear sources on land leased from Texas Tech University.\nCoreWeave will anchor the first 250 megawatts of capacity at Horizon, expected to come online late next year, with room to expand another 500 megawatts.\nHorizon\u2019s on-site power generation is designed to mitigate grid constraints that have slowed other data-center projects in Texas, where energy regulators are now empowered to throttle big users during shortages.\nPoolside co-founder Eiso Kant said the ability to deploy infrastructure quickly is now \u201cthe real physical bottleneck\u201d in AI development. Modular construction methods and proximity to energy sources are meant to cut costs and speed delivery; a 2-gigawatt build would normally cost about $16 billion, not counting Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips.\nPoolside is also in a $2 billion fundraising round that would value the company at $14 billion, up from $3 billion last year.

        "content": "KPG Funds\nhas lost control of its Greenwich Village office redevelopment after its lender took over the leasehold on the property.\nThorofare, through an entity tied to its REIT, acquired the 99-year ground lease at\n132 West 14th Street\nin a deal valued at $27.7 million, property records show. The deal marks the end of a troubled chapter for KPG, which had ambitious plans to convert the aging, seven-story building into a boutique Class A office and retail property.\nKPG signed the long-term ground lease with the owner, The Salvation Army, in 2021 for $22.1 million, and a year later secured a $34.5 million construction loan from Thorofare for an overhaul estimated to cost $55 million.\nThe redevelopment of the property, once dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s ugliest building,\u201d called for demolition of the front and rear facades, along with the addition of new steel structures. The project was nearing completion but had yet to receive a new certificate of occupancy, according to\nPincusCo\n, which first reported on the acquisition.\n\nThe building, located between Sixth and Seventh avenues, was marketed earlier this year by a JLL team with an asking price of roughly $50 million. But financial strain soon followed. In June, the Salvation Army filed a nonpayment case in Manhattan housing court, alleging KPG had failed to pay two quarters\u2019 worth of ground rent totaling $162,500. The court issued a default judgment in favor of the Salvation Army in August, paving the way for Thorofare to step in.\nThe lender\u2019s move to assume control is a familiar one in today\u2019s tightening office market, where rising interest rates and leasing headwinds have squeezed even well-capitalized developers. KPG, led by\nGregory Kraut\nand Rod Kritsberg, bet on the NYC office market as other landlords began defaulting and handing over keys.\nKPG sought to convert aging Class B and Class C buildings into high-end boutique offices. It focused on areas such as Soho, Tribeca and Greenwich Village, where office supply is limited. But the firm has faced mounting challenges as demand for new office space remains uneven across the city.\nRepresentatives for Thorofare and KPG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Keith Kurland and Michael Diaz with Walker &amp; Dunlap arranged the refinancing on Terra\u2019s behalf.\nThe mortgage replaces a $127 million loan provided by an affiliate of MF1 Capital last year, the statement said.\nIn 2023, Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\n, led by David Martin, and Miami-based New Valley, led by Howard Lober, completed Natura Gardens, a garden-style complex that consists of 12 three-story buildings, records show. The project offers a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments ranging from 727 square feet to 1,476 square feet. Monthly rents range from $2,125 to $4,851, according to Apartments.com.\n\nIn 2021, the joint venture secured a\n$64.8 million\nconstruction loan from Bank OZK to build Natura Gardens. Terra and New Valley had originally planned a much larger mixed-use development for the 72-acre site they acquired for $52 million from Prologis in 2019.\nIn 2021, before construction began on Natura Gardens, Terra and New Valley sold 45 acres for $53.5 million to Butters Group and Greystar, which are planning 500,000 square feet of industrial space and a 360-unit multifamily community.\nThe Natura Gardens refinancing follows a series of major loan closings across Terra\u2019s portfolio. In January, the firm secured a\n$291 million\nloan for its CentroCity, a mixed-use development with 470 apartments in Miami. Last year, Terra and Grass River obtained a\n$245 million\nrefinancing for their Grove Central mixed-use project in Coconut Grove.\nRecently, Terra offered to purchase and overhaul the 70-year-old Miami Seaquarium on Virginia Key into a modern, marine life\u2013free aquarium and education campus. The planned\n$22.5 million\nacquisition will preserve the site\u2019s signature dome and add new retail, dining, a marina and green public spaces.\nThe deal has to clear a couple of hurdles. First, a bankruptcy judge in Delaware has to sign off on the sale of the lease and is expected to rule on it on Friday. Should the judge approve the transfer, Terra would also need to obtain final approval from Miami-Dade County, which owns the land underneath Miami Seaquarium.",

        "content": "A proptech startup has entered the chat on private listings, offering a possible alternative to pocket listings in the Texas luxury market.\nAs real estate heavy hitters Compass, Zillow and the National Association of Realtors duke it out over the legality of private listings, Dayton, Ohio-based Unlisted has created a product that turns the whisper network of off-market listings into an app.\nThe Waitlist is a platform that lets homeowners gauge buyer interest before listing. The web app, which will eventually be available on iOS as well, lets window shoppers express interest in homes before their owners are ready to sell. Homeowners can respond to users on their waitlist, and its profit model sells real estate agents the chance to own zip codes on its website.\nThe goal is to create Waitlist profiles for every home in the country, using property descriptions generated automatically and public record data purchased from ATTOM. Since the app launched on June 18, 7,000 homes, worth an estimated $5 billion, have generated waitlists.\nReal estate agents can buy zip codes in the Unlisted system, assuming the title of Local Expert and attaching their information to every home profile in the area. Only one agent is selected per zip code, and most of them so far are Sotheby\u2019s International Realty professionals.\nJB Hayes, a Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s agent who\u2019s bought five zip codes throughout Dallas, is betting on Unlisted to become a springboard for off-market transactions.\n\u201cBefore, people would share off-markets with their colleagues that are in other brokerages, or people they\u2019ve done deals with, but that\u2019s illegal marketing now,\u201d Hayes said.\nShe\u2019s referring to the nationwide dispute over the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy, a rule that requires listing agents to put a property on the local MLS within one day of marketing it for sale. Zillow has lent its considerable muscle to enforcing the rule,\ninterpreting yard signs and social media posts as public marketing\n.\nNAR and Zillow are challenging Compass, which has pioneered private exclusive listings on a systematic scale. In addition, Compass has inspired firms like\nDouglas Elliman, Corcoran\nand\nColdwell Banker\nto prove NAR\u2019s rule.\n\nBut Unlisted founder Katie Hill insists The Waitlist isn\u2019t a shopping platform, and it isn\u2019t meant to facilitate off-market sales.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the vision right now. We want to be a readiness site, not a listing site,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe entire industry as we know it competes in listings; nobody competes in folks who are not for sale.\u201d\nEffective November, homeowners on the site can authorize agents to update their property profiles.\nThe app could be particularly useful in Austin, where high property taxes and no mandatory sales price disclosure generate a strong preference for privacy among luxury buyers and sellers for whom it\u2019s more profitable to avoid a flashy price tag.\nBecause private sales keep local appraisers in the dark about the true price of a property,\nit\u2019s all but conventional for homes above $10 million to avoid the Austin MLS altogether\n, according to Jeanne and Julie Residential Group, an Austin luxury team.\n\u201cAustin is an anomaly. California puts everything on MLS, everything. And Dallas and Houston put pretty much everything on MLS. So Austin\u2019s really kind of an anomaly in the country,\u201d Jeanne Parker said.\nA dwindling buyer pool in Austin is driving more Austin ultra-luxury sellers to the open market this year, according to the team. However, as long as there are wealthy buyers and sellers who want privacy more than a top-dollar offer, there will be a demand for private listings.\n\u201cPeople get the most exposure when you promote and market and list. That is definitely the best way to go, because you\u2019re going to drive up the price, and there\u2019s more people that are going to get their eyeballs on it. There are some people that just don\u2019t care,\u201d Hayes said.\n\u201cThey get the price they want, they\u2019re going to be happy. So why go through all the hoops to make the house show-ready?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The City of Los Angeles\u2019 public housing authority added another property to its portfolio with plans to offer affordable housing.\nThe\nHousing Authority of the City of Los Angeles\nbought the 154-unit Emerald Apartments near the Fashion District for $49.7 million, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal for the property at 215 West 14th Street works out to $322,665 per unit.\nJade Enterprises developed the complex in 2023 and sold it to HACLA with the representation of JLL\u2019s Blake Rogers. The housing authority acquired the property with funding from\nCity National Bank\nand hopes to secure even more financing next year.\nHACLA plans to restrict 24 percent of the units in the building to households earning between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income. In Los Angeles County, for one person, that would be an\nannual income\nof between $31,800 and $63,600, or between $45,450 and $90,900 for a household of four.\nThe Emerald Apartments will undergo a revamp under HACLA\u2019s supervision. The agency, one of the country\u2019s oldest public housing authorities, plans to add six\naccessory dwelling units\nand 2,400 square feet of retail space to the property in the coming months.\n\nThe complex includes a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units and amenities including a pool, gym, community room and structured parking deck. The affordable housing restrictions will go into effect as units turn over, thereby preventing tenants from being displaced.\n\u201cThe Emerald acquisition is about protecting our neighborhoods and ensuring working-class Angelenos have access to safe, stable and affordable housing,\u201d L.A. City Councilmember\nYsabel Jurado\nsaid\nin a statement. \u201cBy preserving affordability in existing communities, we are keeping families together, preventing displacement and building a Los Angeles where every family can thrive.\u201d\nHACLA owns about 160 properties across Los Angeles providing housing to more than 212,000 people. In the past four years alone, the body has acquired nearly 40 properties, including a 335-unit apartment complex in Woodland Hills\npurchased last year\nfor $141.9 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A pair of creekside medical office buildings in Marin County sold for more than $24 million last month, according to public records.\nBay Area-based Wareham Development Corporation sold the two offices at 2 and 18 Bon Air Road in Larkspur to Anchor Health Properties, a Charlottesville, Virginia-based real estate investment trust, for $24.1 million.\nMarinHealth leases both buildings for specialty outpatient services. At a combined 27,300 square feet, they fit into a larger constellation of medical offices in the area, which includes a regional hospital. Marin Health is under lease until 2031.\nSan Rafael-based Wareham Development, which is known for its focus in developing life science buildings, had owned the properties for decades.\nThe building at 2 Bon Air Road was once a Safeway grocery store, which Wareham renovated into a large medical office in 1991.\nThe second building, across a parking lot at 18 Bon Air Road, had been a fast food restaurant before Wareham\u2019s redevelopment into an outpatient facility in 2004.\nCaroline Reynolds of JLL said the $881-per-square-foot price was high but ultimately incomparable to other North Bay office sales as the buildings represent \u201chighly specialized\u201d outpatient facilities.\nA source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the location had much to do with Wareham\u2019s motivation to sell.\n\nStarted by Rich Robbins in 1977, Wareham Development\u2019s portfolio dots the Bay Area, but the main hub sits in the East Bay, with large research campuses in Berkeley and Emeryville. The source said Marin County, where Wareham has one other property, stretched the company\u2019s orbit too far.\nWareham Development partner James Goddard said the sale would provide revenue to reinvest into the firm\u2019s other Bay Area campuses.\n\u201cThis was an asset that we had owned for many decades. As our portfolio has grown and expanded, it became a geographically isolated project,\u201d Goddard said. \u201cNow was an opportune time to sell and reinvest the funds into our large format campus locations in the East Bay and in the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto.\u201d\nThe company\nmade headlines\nin February when it announced plans to sell Berkeley\u2019s historic Fantasy Studios.\nKnown as \u201cThe House that Creedence Built,\u201d the more than 121,000-square-foot complex had hosted recording studios where bands such Creedence Clearwater Revival, Santana, Joan Baez and Green Day all cut records. The studios closed in 2018.\nRobbins, who owned the buildings since 2007, had planned to turn the property into a life sciences research lab, but ditched those plans.\nAnchor Health Properties did not return requests for comment. The Virginia-based company owns and manages 150 healthcare facilities across the country, including a maternal care facility in Burlingame, leased by Sutter Health.\n",

        "content": "The owner of one of Houston\u2019s most recognizable skyscrapers has filed for bankruptcy, marking the latest setback for downtown\u2019s long-stalled revival.\nBell Business Investments, the owner of the 45-story ExxonMobil tower at 800 Bell Street, filed for Chapter 11 protection last week after its residential conversion plans collapsed and its lender moved to foreclose, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe 1.2 million-square-foot building \u2014 once the headquarters of Humble Oil, a predecessor to\nExxonMobil\n\u2014 has been vacant since\nExxon\nleft for its Spring campus in 2015.\nThe borrower, managed by Brooklyn developer\nIsaac Jacobowitz of Carnegie Management\n, acquired the property from San Francisco-based\nShorenstein Properties\nin early 2023 through an affiliate, reportedly paying half the $50 million Shorenstein spent on it a decade earlier.\nThe 2023 purchase included a $14.5 million loan from Shorenstein, and the debt was sold at a discount in April to a Nevada entity, 800 Bell Holdings LLC. That entity sued to foreclose, accusing Jacobowitz\u2019s firm of blocking access to the property, neglecting maintenance, and failing to share financial records.\nThe landlord disputes the allegations, calling them \u201cbogus non-monetary defaults\u201d and claiming the lender turned aggressive soon after acquiring the note. While property taxes have since been paid, the lender\u2019s attorney, Houston-based Sanford Dow, said the building is in disrepair, citing broken windows and water damage.\n\n\u201cBBI had a sweetheart deal and couldn\u2019t get out of their own way,\u201d Dow said in an email to the outlet, describing the bankruptcy as an effort to stall foreclosure.\nThe bankruptcy filing temporarily halted foreclosure proceedings and a separate lawsuit while the court considers next steps. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13. In court documents, the landlord said it has a contract to sell the building for $35 million, with closing set for this Friday \u2014 a deal that would require court approval.\nOnce envisioned as a marquee residential conversion that could anchor downtown Houston\u2019s post-pandemic rebound, 800 Bell is now emblematic of the city\u2019s office-to-housing struggle.\nThe 1962 tower \u2014 briefly the tallest west of the Mississippi \u2014 was added to the National Register of Historic Places this year \u2014 a designation that could aid future redevelopment but hasn\u2019t yet saved it from financial freefall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
