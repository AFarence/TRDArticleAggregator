        "content": "Gary Barnett appears to have found an anchor tenant for his Midtown office development, nearing a deal to ink a massive lease.\nGlobal law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett is set to take roughly 700,000 square feet at Extell Development\u2019s 570 Fifth Avenue, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal would be the second-largest office lease signed in New York this year, trailing only New York University\u2019s 1.1-million-square-foot lease at 770 Broadway.\nThe move raises questions about the fate of Simpson Thacher\u2019s longtime home at 425 Lexington Avenue. The firm already subleased portions of that space in recent years, suggesting 570 Fifth may replace rather than supplement its Midtown digs.\nTerms of the lease weren\u2019t disclosed, but average asking rents in Midtown were nearly $80 per square foot in the second quarter, according to Newmark.\nExtell\u2019s plan for the site \u2014 between West 46th and 47th streets \u2014 has evolved from a proposed supertall into a\n29-story office-and-retail tower\n. Ikea, through Ingka Investments, will\nanchor the retail component\nwith 80,000 square feet and a one-third stake in the full project.\nThe developer completed a $175 million land buy earlier this year to round out the necessary assemblage.\nDelivery of the KPF-designed tower is expected by the end of 2028.\n\nIf finalized, the Simpson Thacher lease would mark a major win for Barnett at a time when securing tenants of that scale has become rare.\nThe law firm\u2019s deal joins other notable signings this year, including\nAmazon\u2019s 330,000-square-foot lease at 10 Bryant Park\nand Goodwin Procter\u2019s\n250,000-square-foot deal at 200 Fifth Avenue\n.\nNationally, law firms have been an outsized driver of office demand, signing nearly 6 million square feet in the first half of 2025, the sector\u2019s strongest showing since 2018, according to Savills.\nFor Barnett, the lease is validation of a strategic pivot. Extell in 2021\nfiled plans\nfor a 78-story mixed-use tower with more than 1,500 hotel rooms and nearly 500 apartments at the same site.\nInstead, the developer doubled down on the office play and\nsecured financing from South Korea\u2019s IGIS Asset Management\nto move forward.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A member of the Simkins family sold a waterfront home in North Bay Village to an investor who has been buying up houses in the three-island town,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe investor, Pawan Singh, has paid $61.5 million on 11 houses, many on the water, on Terrace Drive in\nNorth Bay Village\n, according to\nTRD\u2019s\nanalysis of property records. Singh has assembled at least 2.5 acres of land in the village via purchases in his name and LLCs linked to him. He likely controls more than 500 feet of water frontage, though it\u2019s not entirely contiguous.\nSingh is CEO of Vienna, Virginia-based NavX Consulting, a management and technology consulting firm, and previously was a principal at Deloitte, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a request for comment.\nHis latest purchase is the largest he\u2019s made since he began buying houses on the island in 2022. Last week, he paid $13.5 million for the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house at 1365 Bay Terrace. The property has 215 feet of waterfront.\nSingh purchased the property via a Falls Church, Virginia-based LLC. Simkins paid just over $3 million for the 3,700-square-foot house in 2016, records show. The corner lot includes a waterfront pool and dock. The five-bedroom, four-bathroom house was built in 1942.\nSingh\u2019s first purchase was in 2022, when he paid $3.9 million for the four-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 1480 South Treasure Drive. The 2,556-square-foot home, built in 1950, sits on a 0.2-acre lot with 60 feet of waterfront. Mark Stephan of Engel &amp; Voelkers brokered that deal.\n\nSingh has listed at least one of the properties for rent. The 2,015-square-foot, three-bedroom and four-bathroom house at 7401 Miami View Drive is asking\n$8,000 a month\n. It\u2019s listed with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Elizabeth Gazay.\nLarger assemblages of waterfront land have sold for record prices in Miami Beach over the past year.\nIn July, spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser and the Posner Group paid $105 million for\nthe 2.3-acre estate\nat 5940 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. The partners are looking to flip the property for $169 million, or rent it out for $495,000 a month, but Glaser is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listings.\nHomeowners in North Bay Village include developer Alexandra Eichner, Anatomy Fitness co-owner Marc Megna, the owners of Farrey\u2019s Lighting &amp; Bath, and a number of real estate agents, including Sam Heskial, Sari Libben Shapiro and Chris Wands, property records show.\nWands, an agent with Douglas Elliman, said the neighborhood\u2019s location and security appealed to him and his wife when they moved in 2021. North Bay Island is a gated community.\n\u201cI felt it was undervalued with the connectivity to the beach and the mainland. Without traffic, I\u2019m in the Design District or beach in 10 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife loved the idea that it had its own municipalities, police and fire.\u201d\nLast month, a Miami businessman sold the waterfront home at 7520 West Treasure Drive\nfor $12.5 million\n, marking one of the priciest deals ever recorded in the town and the most expensive on Treasure Island.\nA handful of major condo and mixed-use projects are also planned in the town, including developments led by Related Group and Macklowe Properties, the Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties, a partnership led by Vivian Dimond, the Eichners\u2019 Continuum Company and Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons.\n",

        "content": "Waterton has tightened its grip on Chicago\u2019s rental housing market, shelling out nearly $90 million for a Fulton Market apartment tower while weighing the sale of another downtown property.\nThe multifamily investment firm paid $89.5 million, or $340,300 per apartment, for The Mason, a 263-unit building at 180 North Ada Street, according to property records. The 14-story tower opened in 2019 and was developed by Naperville-based Marquette Cos. and Deutsche Bank affiliate DWS Group, which put it up for sale in April, CoStar\nreported\n.\nCasey Mog, the firm\u2019s vice president of acquisitions, said the firm leapt at the opportunity to add a property in the West Loop back into their portfolio, following the $35 million sale of the 81-unit property at 20 North Aberdeen Street to JAB Real Estate, which notched a 13 percent discount from the property\u2019s previous value with the deal.\nThe acquisition pulls one of Fulton Market\u2019s most prominent listings off the market in a neighborhood that has seen some of the city\u2019s\npriciest\nmultifamily deals. Earlier this year, a New York investor\npaid $170 million\nfor the 375-unit Fulbrix tower on Elizabeth Street, less than a block away.\n\nWaterton\u2019s move comes as the firm could just as\neasily\nbe a seller. In August, it listed the 346-unit Grand Central apartments in the South Loop, less than two years after buying the property for $81.9 million. The dual strategy follows the 2023 close of its $1.73 billion value-add fund, one of the largest of its kind in the country.\nMarquette and DWS had financed the property with a $54.7 million Wells Fargo loan in 2022. The partnership sold another downtown asset, the 223-unit Catalyst tower, for $94 million earlier this year. They didn\u2019t disclose what they had hoped to fetch for The Mason. CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Danny Zeboski, along with Eastdil Secured\u2019s Kenneth Glomb and Bryan Rosenberg, marketed the sale.\nThe Mason\u2019s amenities include a rooftop lounge, co-working areas, fitness club and a pool deck with cabanas and fire pits.\nWaterton\nsaid it will make light upgrades to units, common areas and amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A bruising, decade-long development process and ensuing court fight over a newly built suburban Chicago apartment complex ended with a $65 million sale\nJSB Capital Group\nlast week.\nRescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments, based in Kansas City, Missouri, gave the green light to sell the Lincoln Station property in New Lenox, a southwest suburb, to the Miami-based JSB following a lawsuit it filed against developer Richard Gammonley, who has a checkered past of real estate investments in the Chicago area, public records show.\nThe 220-unit property completed in 2024 at 208 North Prairie Road was originally conceived in the mid-2010s, when Gammonley was trying to pitch a more than 300-unit plan to New Lenox officials. Due to concerns with the scope of the proposal, however, the project was scaled back, and was finally completed as five separate buildings, each with 44 units, that sits near the town\u2019s Metra train station connecting to downtown Chicago.\nBut the project ran into financial trouble. Gammonley\u2019s development venture turned to 7 Acre, led by Adam Fletcher and Chase Watson, for more debt to help complete the project about a year ago. The Lincoln Station developer borrowed $1.4 million in September 2024 to help fund cost overruns on the project, public records show. As collateral for the loan, the Gammonley venture pledged 76 percent of the ownership interest in the LLC used as the property\u2019s owner.\nYet by November, Gammonley was in default on the debt to 7 Acre, according to a letter contained in Missouri court records from the lender to the developers. In December, 7 Acre filed a lawsuit against Gammonley, who has tussled with lenders over multifamily and condo developments in the Chicago area multiple times throughout his career, previous reports said.\nGammonley fought back against the allegations. He claimed that after 7 Acre made the loan, it improperly tried to insert itself into the decision-making process as the development team was looking to sell Lincoln Station, with the understanding that the lender would be paid back out of the proceeds from the sale.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, 7 Acre interfered with two separate purchase negotiations for the property, that were all but under contract in the months of November and December 2024, by attempting to raise purchase price and altering the core structure of the deals in the last hour,\u201d Gammonley alleged.\nHe argued the conduct of the lender caused the debt to enter default and that 7 Acre should be blocked from asserting its right to take majority control of the property\u2019s ownership.\nJSB and 7 Acre did not respond to a request for comment, nor did attorneys for Gammonley.\nThe lawsuit was settled earlier this month, but a person familiar with the situation said 7 Acre ended up in control of most of the property ahead of the sale. The developers made little to no money on the transaction, after factoring project costs, despite only taking out a $34 million senior construction loan in 2022 to fund the development, the source said. The developers incurred additional debt behind that loan that was separate from the 7 Acre loan to complete the buildings.\nThe deal closed as\ninterest from institutional landlords is ramping up\nin Chicago-area multifamily properties, due to rising rents stemming from the low supply of new development projects on the horizon amid difficult fundraising conditions in real estate equity markets. Earlier this month, Waterton, one of the nation\u2019s largest apartment landlords, paid $90 million for a property in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market neighborhood, on the heels of\ntwo other trades in the city\u2019s suburbs that each exceeded $100 million\n, the first in\nVernon Hills\nand the second in Naperville.\n",

        "content": "A development approved by the Chicago Plan Commission will bring one of the first hotels to the Far South Side in decades.\nConstruction is expected to begin on the $30 million, 101-room hotel in the Pullman neighborhood early next year. Located at 111th Street and Doty Avenue, the 62,000 square foot, 4-story Hampton by Hilton Hotel will be the first ever nationally branded hotel in the neighborhood.\nThe Pullman Hotel Group LLC bought the land from Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives with a $5 million grant from the city of Chicago\u2019s Recovery Grant Program. It also received a $100,000 pre-development grant from the Chicago Community Trust.\nThe project is the latest in a series of investments in the far south side community that began with a Walmart Super Center opening in 2014, followed by two Gotham Greens greenhouses, an SC Johnson warehouse, an Amazon fulfillment center and a Whole Foods Distribution Center.\n\u201cNone of this could have happened without Walmart. Walmart was the first catalyst that broke the ice for us, and that created the synergy to keep the ball rolling,\u201d said 9th Ward Alderman Anthony Beale.\nThe past 10 years of development are starting to turn the tides for a neighborhood that experienced redlining and other disinvestment methods from the public and private sectors throughout much of the last 75 years.\n\nThe hotel will also serve visitors to the Pullman National Historical Park which was designated a national monument by President Barack Obama in 2015. The historic site commemorates the history of the Pullman Company Town which was developed in the late 1800s to serve workers from the Pullman Luxury Rail Car factory.\nWorking-class residents of the town went on to play a key role in early labor and civil rights movements including the establishment of the The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which was the first all-African-American labor union in the country.\nUntil recently, much of the major economic activity taking place on the south side of Chicago centered around The University of Chicago in Hyde Park.\nBut investment has been expanding to Bronzeville, South Shore and some farther south side communities including Pullman.\nIn Bronzeville, a megadevelopment centered on medical technology and services could provide an economic boon to the community that was once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cBlack Metropolis.\u201d Speculation has\nspurred multifamily interest\nbut\nslow progress on the megadevelopment\nis casting doubt on the overall impact it will have on the area.\nMeanwhile, farther south of Hyde Park, the near completion of the Obama Presidential Library is making waves. The area has seen renewed investor interest including\na 28-story hotel proposal\nat 6402 South Stony Island Drive.\nAlso on the far south side, the state of Illinois is providing $500 million toward a $9 billion\nquantum computing campus\nled by CRG and Related Midwest that is planned for the former U.S. Steel South Works site, which closed in 1992.",

In late August, though, the judge overseeing the case approved Rialto\u2019s request to withdraw its motion to declare RFR in default.\n\nA spokesperson for Rialto was not immediately available for comment and a representative for RFR declined to comment. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger is overseeing the note-sale process.\nRFR bought the building for $37 million in 2000, and refinanced in 2017 with a $104.5 million loan from Goldman Sachs, which sold the debt off to CMBS investors.\nThe 137,000-square-foot building had recently been partially leased to Compass, which had an 89,000-square-foot office there. Compass\nsevered its lease\n, though, and now the 126,000-square-foot office portion is completely vacant.\nRialto and Rosen\nhave sparred before\n, and in some instances have been able to work out deals. RFR negotiated a settlement when Rialto sued the company over 17 State Street. But the rules of engagement are stricter when it comes to CMBS investors, which Rialto is representing in this action.\n",

        "content": "A player in the Hamptons trophy market has unlocked another achievement.\nMatthew Karch, co-founder of video game developer Saber Interactive, paid $31.5 million for a 1970s-era oceanfront estate in East Hampton Village, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. The home lines up with Zillow images and past reports as 33 Lily Pond Lane.\nThe sale breaks down to $4,500 per square foot.\nThe roughly two-acre spread sits directly on the beach with a 7,000-square-foot main house, a guesthouse, tennis court and pool.\nKarch said the location sold him \u2014 \u201cthe house literally sits on top of the ocean\u201d \u2014 and he plans to replace the existing five-bedroom residence with a build he\u2019ll use as a second home.\nThe sellers, Norman and Helene Stark, owned the property since 1994, when they bought it for $4.7 million. They first floated it for $75 million in 2017, pulling it on and off the market over the years before cutting the ask to $39 million.\n\nKarch, who is based in Florida, isn\u2019t new to the Hamptons. He owns two homes in Sag Harbor and told the outlet he may sell one now that he\u2019s secured his East Hampton oceanfront perch. In 2020, he paid\n$10 million\nfor a condominium unit at Auberge Beach Residences &amp; Spa in Fort Lauderdale.\nFounded in 2001, Saber Interactive counts more than 1,300 employees among its ranks. Notable games developed by the company include Will Rock, TimeShift and NBA Playgrounds.\nThe East Hampton deal underscores how quickly the East End\u2019s ultra-luxury market has bounced back from a recent lull. Pandemic-driven demand drove prices to records, but sales slowed sharply in early 2023 as inventory thinned and mortgage rates spiked, according to a Douglas Elliman report from Jonathan Miller.\nMomentum turned late in 2023 when closings were up annually in the fourth quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. By this summer, brokers say, the market was moving at its fastest clip since the pandemic boom.\nThat\u2019s borne out in the numbers: in the second quarter, there were 26 trades at $10 million or higher, up from 22 a year earlier and just six in 2023, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller\u2019s Douglas Elliman report.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "One of Miami Beach\u2019s last gas stations will be redeveloped into a mixed-use Class A office building,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nArkadia\nProperty Group, led by Richard Kilstock and David Aaron, closed on acquisition of the gas station and car wash at 1840 Alton Road last week, Aaron said. The Bal Harbour-based firm plans to develop a 40,000-square-foot office building with 2,500 square feet of food and beverage retail space on the 0.4-acre property.\nIt\u2019s in the\nSunset Harbour\nneighborhood. The building, called Sunset House, will be 75 feet tall and will include at least one residential-office live-work unit, which is required by the zoning. Arkadia secured zoning changes two years ago that will allow the developer and neighboring property owners to build an additional 10 feet of height, Aaron said.\nThe deal has been in the works for more than a decade. Aaron said that he and his partner bought an option to purchase the property 12 years ago. Mika Mattingly, now with Colliers, was involved in arranging that contract in 2013.\nProperty records show Alton Road Supreme Services, led by Jose M. Suarez, sold the site. It was developed in 1997. It\u2019s one of six gas stations left in Miami Beach.\n\u201cWe saw this convergence of neighborhoods and we knew something was happening but we didn\u2019t pretend to know what and when,\u201d Aaron said. The deal was originally structured as a sale-leaseback, but it fell apart at the last minute. \u201cThe only solution we found was to create an option for the property.\u201d\nKilstock said in a statement that the neighborhood has \u201cchanged dramatically over the past 12 years.\u201d\nArkadia paid $4.2 million for the property, Aaron said.\n\nAaron pointed to the \u201cclear demand\u201d for new office space in the area, and the lack of available office space at\nEighteen Sunset\n, a five-story office project in Sunset Harbour being developed by Bradley Colmer\u2019s Deco Capital Group and billionaire Marc Rowan\u2019s RWN Real Estate Partners. Audemars Piguet is among the tenants set to open.\nEighteen Sunset has reportedly signed leases at $160 per square foot, net.\nKobi Karp of Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design designed the new project.\nNewmark\u2019s Matt Himmelsbach was hired to handle office leasing, and Sara Wolfe of Wolfe Town Retail will lease the retail space. Robert Kaplan and Mark Rutherford of Cushman &amp; Wakefield were the debt brokers on the deal. Mark Meland and Bryan Vega at Meland Budwick, and land use attorney Michael Larkin of Berkow were also involved.\nThe building could be delivered about 30 months from now, Aaron said. The developer will complete the required environmental remediation.\nProspective tenants could include residents on\nNorth Bay Road\n, the Sunset and Venetian islands, and Sunset Harbour. Preleasing is underway, Himmelsbach said. He declined to disclose asking rents.\n\u201cSunset Harbour is extremely demanded and special. People want to work there but there\u2019s no supply,\u201d Himmelsbach said. \u201cThere\u2019s a missing hole that this building will fill.\u201d\n",

Maxxam Enterprises did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe building at 1453-1457 3rd Street Promenade, called Promenade Gateway, is worth $180 million and hasn\u2019t lost value since underwriting a decade ago. But the decline in occupancy cut into income and cash flow, which each dropped to $3 million in June, compared to almost $9 million two years ago.\nThe latest servicer commentary before the refinancing loan was transferred to special servicing, indicated that the borrower has been marketing the property since the second quarter of last year and is looking for tenants. The largest occupants include Luma Pictures, Like Labs, Lululemon, Riverside Partners and Rialto Capital Management, which account for 42 percent of the space.\nThe property has 61,000 square feet of office, 33,300 square feet of retail and 32 multifamily units.\nThird Street Promenade\nhas been in an economic decline since the pandemic. Shops, bars and restaurants have less foot traffic, resulting in empty storefronts. That got politicians\u2019 attention: The city council in May\napproved\na proposal to turn the area into an entertainment zone, meaning people could buy alcohol from businesses and drink their drinks outside \u2014 very Vegas-esque.

        "content": "The site of the Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Francisco is slated to become a life sciences complex, though developer SteelWave still has some hurdles to clear.\nThe San Mateo-based firm won approval from the city Planning Commission on a 12-year development agreement to redevelop the Golden Gate Produce Terminal into a 2.5 million-square-foot, five-building life sciences campus, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nWith SteelWave\u2019s approval secured, the famous\nGolden Gate Produce Terminal\nwill have to consider a major relocation for a second time in its history. It left its former home in San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero during the area\u2019s redevelopment in the 1960s, ending up in South San Francisco in 1969. The Golden Gate property is one of the largest and busiest produce terminals across Northern California, providing restaurants, retailers and members of the public access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\nSouth San Francisco has gained a reputation as one of the country\u2019s top life sciences hubs. But the past four years in the biotech industry have faced a cut in funding from investors and venture capital firms as well as a glut of millions of square feet of new space coming online. That has sent Bay Area life sciences vacancy rates higher than 25 percent, according to the Business Times.\n\nOnce a project is approved, developers usually have two to three years to secure permits and start construction, according to the Business Times. When SteelWave decides to dig shovels in the ground remains to be seen, but the Produce Terminal can remain in operation until then.\nSteelWave leased the 17.6-acre produce terminal site at 131 Terminal Court in 2022. SteelWave bought another 8.7-acre site at 101 Terminal Court for $85 million. Its planned biotech projects are known as Infinite 101 and Infinite 131. The Infinite 101 site is set aside for life sciences and won city approval in 2023 for 700,000 square feet. If the City Council approves the development agreement, it would essentially extend the timeline for development of Infinite 101 and provide development approvals for Infinite 131 with another roughly 1.7 million square feet.\nAt the same time, the City of South San Francisco is considering rezoning five adjacent parcels along Produce Avenue and Terminal Court to allow for \u201cbusiness technology,\u201d according to the Business Times.\nTwo other biotech projects in South San Francisco \u2014\nIQHQ\u2019s development\nat 800 Dubuque Avenue and Steelwave\u2019s project at 180 El Camino Real \u2014 are looking to extend development rights in the hope that the biotech market will bounce back.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Some of South Florida\u2019s biggest developers are in secretive talks to develop a rare, 38-acre waterfront property in Miami.\nIt\u2019s the Miami-Dade County-owned Miami Seaquarium property on Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay, and little is known about proposals so far, according to reporting from the\nMiami Herald\n.\nIntegra\nInvestments, headed by Paulo Tavares de Melo, has submitted a 28-page presentation on its vision for the site.\nDavid Martin\nof\nTerra\nhas also thrown his hat in the ring, and signed an NDA to do so, the outlet reported. A spokesperson for Martin declined the outlet\u2019s request for comment, and it is unclear whether the developer has submitted a formal proposal.\nCounty leaders have expressed interest in a marina on the site.\n\u201cA marina has always been a discussed use there,\u201d Miami-Dade Commissioner Raquel Regalado told the outlet. Regalado is the commission\u2019s representative in lease talks with the Dolphin Company, and the\nSeaquarium\nsite is part of her district.\n\u201cOn the county\u2019s side, there has always been a desire to expand marinas and to expand dry-dock storage,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cThat\u2019s a big need for the county.\u201d\nIt may mark the end for the Seaquarium, which opened in 1955, and is one of the oldest oceanariums in the country, according to reports. Famously, the hit 1960s show Flipper filmed at the theme park.\n\nThe Seaquarium\u2019s parent company, Mexico-based Dolphin Company, has a ground lease with the county for the site at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway. The county filed an\neviction lawsuit against Miami Seaquarium\nlast year, alleging Dolphin failed to maintain Miami Seaquarium in good repair and clean condition. The county also alleged the Seaquarium was in violation of the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary, according to published reports.\nSeaquarium representatives deny the allegations, the Herald reported. Dolphin, led by CEO Eduardo Albor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, and is seeking to raise cash in its restructuring, according to\nreports\n.\nIt\u2019s been a contentious process. In April, Albor and about 20 armed men took control of Dolphin\u2019s Cancun headquarters,\nBloomberg\nreported. In June, a U.S. bankruptcy judge moved to Sanction Albor for $10,000 a day, in response to him defying court orders,\nWLRN\nreported.\nAs the company restructures and pursues deals, Miami-Dade has a unique position to weigh in on the future of the Seaquarium property. Because the site is county-owned, any agreement Dolphin came to with Integra, Terra, or another firm, would require a vote by the county commission. Redevelopment of the site is also complicated by its land use restrictions. The property is part of the county parks system, which means condos and apartments are likely a no-go.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

The closing price and buyer were not immediately known.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Marci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi, who\nrepresented\nPitt on the sale, declined comment.\nPitt bought the home from oil heiress and philanthropist\nAileen Getty\nin 2023 for $5.5 million. The trade was part of a swap of sorts, with Getty paying $33 million for Pitt\u2019s Craftsman-style home in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe Steel House is tucked away on a hill surrounded by palm trees and other landscaping, with three beds and two baths. The property made headlines of its own in June when\nburglars\ntargeted the residence while Pitt was away.\nThe actor appears to be doing some fine tuning of his real estate portfolio, with the Carolwood connection handling Pitt\u2019s purchase of a\n$12 million home\nin the Hollywood Hills last month. The Killers lead guitarist Dave Keuning and his wife and interior designer, Emilie Keuning, sold the home to Pitt, after originally asking nearly $14 million for the hillside abode. It has six beds and eight baths across 8,400 square feet.\nThat Hollywood Hills deal highlights the Carolwood agents\u2019 respective ties to colleagues in the entertainment business, with Mogharrabi counting connections to many of the agents and managers at Creative Artists Agency and William Morris Endeavor. Kays, meanwhile, is dialed into the music world.\nIn June, the duo set a record in Silver Lake with the priciest residential sale in the neighborhood when the five-bed, five-bath home at\n1844 Silverwood Terrace\nclosed for $10 million.\nLast year, Kays and Mogharrabi closed on about $100 million in sales volume.\n",

        "content": "A Kenilworth mansion on Lake Michigan\u2019s shore sold for $6.8 million on Thursday after sitting on the market for four years and taking a more than 50 percent price cut from its listing.\nThe 11,000 square-foot estate at 501 Sheridan Road sits on two lots on the Kenilworth lakefront, covering 1.6 acres. It has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, including a one-bedroom guest suite. The second lot featured a sculpture garden under the previous owners. The sale came out to $618 per square foot.\nThe home, which was built in the 1960s and expanded in 2006, was first listed on a\nprivate market in 2021\n, asking $14 million. It hit the\npublic market in 2022\nfor $14 million, but underwent several price chops before its last listing price at $7.7 million.\nThe ultimate $6.8 million price tag makes it among the most expensive Kenilworth properties sold in recent years, despite the steep drops. One mansion fetched a record $11.75 million in 2020, and another home sold for $9.5 million in 2021, both on Sheridan Road.\nThe buyers plan to tear down the estate and build a new house on the land, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s agent Nancy Nugent, who represented the sellers on the deal, said. Nugent did not name the buyers, and their identity is not available in public records.\nMilena Birov of @properties, who represented the buyers, did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe home was last owned by the late Yadelle and Robert Sklare, and their family managed the sale through their estate, Nugent said. Robert Sklare died in 2008, and Yadelle Sklare died in 2021.\nNugent said the time on the market and big price cuts were in part because the sellers were not in a rush to sell the house. Some offers on the house came when they were not ready to sell, and the family spent time appraising art and organizing an estate sale before selling, she said.\n\u201cWe were ambitious about pricing, but soon realized that we kept clipping the number, and I think my clients, when they were finally ready to let go of the property is when we sold it,\u201d Nugent said.\nMost potential buyers were interested in tearing down the house, and the surge in materials and construction costs in 2021 and 2022 factored into what buyers were willing to pay, Nugent said.\nBecause of the sellers\u2019 situation and the property being a teardown, Nugent said she doesn\u2019t think the drastic price cut is a signal for other high-priced homes in Kenilworth. Space on the lake is sparse, and turnkey homes move quickly on the North Shore.\nJust a few blocks south on Sheridan Road, a\n$15 million, 8,280 square-foot mansion\nreached a pending deal just two weeks after listing. Two more homes in Kenilworth \u2014 one at $6.9 million and one at $6.5 million \u2014 got contingent offers about a month after listing.\n\u201cIf the house is turnkey, it commands whatever the buyer is willing to pay,\u201d Nugent said. \u201cBecause Kenilworth in particular is a very small community, and this was one of the last bastions of teardown properties in Kenilworth.\u201d",

Developers are leaning into brand cachet to target affluent downsizers and international buyers. Transwestern is planning Auberge-branded condos at The RO, while Satya is pushing ahead with a\nSt. Regis-branded\nresidential tower near Memorial Drive that was more than 40 percent pre-sold as of March.\nJeff Samples with IBC Bank, which financed the St. Regis project, said the branded condo wave is a bet on Houston\u2019s growing wealth base.

Architect Jack Hemphill designed the nearly 21,000-square-foot home on 3.2 acres. At $1,362 per square foot, it\u2019s one of the priciest listings within Dallas city limits, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nOnly the Crespi Estate\ntops\nit, among Dallas homes on the market, with an asking price of $64 million and $2,362 per square foot.\nDallas Central Appraisal District records show\nThe property\u2019s ownership is hidden behind the Four Thousand Trust, which acquired it in 2022 following Maguire\u2019s death. Over the past two and a half years, the owners poured millions into upgrades, reimagining the mansion for modern living before a job transfer forced a change of plans.\n\u201cThe whole home has been completely redone,\u201d said Compass broker\nFaisal Halum\n, who has the listing.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a house \u2014 it\u2019s a stage. A great hall stretches the length of the first floor, with refinished parquet floors and custom fixtures. A two-story den with a 23-foot ceiling anchors the home, while the glass conservatory, Art Deco bar and barrel-vaulted banquet hall provide ample space for gatherings. The estate also features a black-lacquered lounge, a wine room, and a sculptural brass tub in the primary suite.\nThe estate\u2019s guest list reads like a who\u2019s who of 20th-century politics. Both Bush presidents, Gerald Ford and Margaret Thatcher walked its halls, while Czech President Vaclav Klaus and Cowboys legend Roger Staubach also made appearances. Maguire\u2019s extensive presidential memorabilia collection once filled the home and was part of the attraction, including Benjamin Harrison\u2019s White House china and busts of every U.S. president.\nHalum called the offering a rare chance to secure land and legacy in one of Dallas\u2019 most\nexclusive\nenclaves, and said grabbing acreage in Preston Hollow is almost impossible.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sale marked Staten Island\u2019s most expensive of all time, beating a $4.6 million deal notched just a year prior.\nThe 11,000-square-foot estate, which has a basketball court, pool and hair salon, hit the market last September asking $9 million. The sellers, Richard and Vania Cardinale of Farm to Bagel, paid just $1.7 million for the property in 2017 and shelled out $6 million to build the eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom home.\nNews of the sale comes as home prices in Staten Island rose last month, with the borough\u2019s median sale price up nearly 9 percent in August compared to the same month last year, according to data from Redfin.\n\u201cStaten Island always seems to be the forgotten borough,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Tom Le, who had the listing for 176 Benedict Road. \u201cIt should get more attention than it does.\u201d\nThe deal for 176 Benedict Road blew past the norm for Staten Island, where the typical home traded for $750,000 in August. But the neighborhood is also home to two other likely exceptions to the local market.\nThe next priciest are a listing for another home on Benedict Road, a six-bedroom abode asking $5.7 million, and a 5,800-square-foot property on High Point Road asking $2.5 million, according to Zillow.\nHomes on Benedict Road purchased in the last two decades have been gut-renovated or knocked down and rebuilt into larger mansions, Le added, which will likely yield even pricier deals when they trade in the coming years.\nOne such deal could be for the mansion across the street, which once belonged to the head of the Gambino crime family, Paul Castellano. The mob boss\u2019 former estate at 177 Benedict Road hit the market two years ago, asking\n$17 million\n. Now priced at $18 million, it\u2019s the most expensive listing in Staten Island.\nNot so fast\u2026\nA contentious divorce between two fashion icons is throwing the fate of some of New York\u2019s swankiest real estate into question.\nNet-A-Porter founder Natalie Massenet sued her husband, Frame Denim co-founder Erik Torstensson, in a Los Angeles court last month, alleging he swindled her out of $95 million during their roughly 15-year relationship and had drug, alcohol and sex addictions.\n\nTorstensson hit back with his own claim in New York court earlier this week when he filed for custody of their 7-year-old son amid allegations that Massenet used drugs, drank heavily and became occasionally \u201cviolent\u201d with Torstensson, the\nNew York Times\nreported.\nThe couple\u2019s messy split will likely extend to their businesses and homes, including their double-wide townhouse on the Upper East Side. An entity tied to Massenet bought the property on East 74th Street for\n$25 million\nin 2019 from developers Larry Gluck and Ivan Hakimian.\nAt the time of the sale, the 12,000-square-foot historic mansion was about 80 percent complete.\nMassenet and Torstensson then embarked on a two-year renovation of the home, which was temporarily thwarted by a rogue sprinkler, which saturated the home, the couple\ntold the Wall Street Journal in 2022\n. The duo then bought the neighboring property with plans to combine it with the under-construction homes.\nThe couple also owns a home in East Hampton on Further Lane, which may have been the site of an extravagant Louis Vuitton garden party featured in Vogue last summer. The article describes the soiree\u2019s setting as a \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cSaltburn-like estate,\u201d where the fashion brand drove guests around the grounds, including a Japanese maple tree sanctuary, in branded Jeeps.\nMassenet hosted the party alongside writer Derek Blasberg and the crown princess of Greece, Marie-Chantal.\nAlso in the pair\u2019s portfolio is an estate outside London known as Donhead House, the renovation of which was featured in the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for a townhouse on the Upper East Side, which closed for\n$21 million\n, or $3,300 per square foot. The deal was less than its 2005 purchase price when the sellers bought it for $22 million and later renovated it.\nThe 20-foot-wide home at 16 East 64th Street, built in the late 1800s, hit the market last March asking $25 million. It spans 8,700 square feet and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, an elevator and two terraces.\nLeslie Garfield\u2019s Thomas Wexler and Tyler Wexler had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Every day brings New York City closer to an election that could prove to have major ramifications for real estate, which is responding with a groundswell of its own.\nAt the start of the week, Jeff Blau and Aby Rosen\norganized a meeting\nof prominent developers to support Andrew Cuomo for mayor and oppose Zohran Mamdani, as first reported by The New York Times.\nDespite Cuomo\u2019s primary loss to Mamdani, he is seen as a top contender, while incumbent Eric Adams is being pressured to suspend his re-election campaign.\nWorth noting: not every real estate figure opposes Mamdani. Affordable housing developers in particular are engaging with his campaign due to his housing-focused agenda.\nIn the city\u2019s office market, JPMorgan is\nmarketing\nits 23-story office building at 125 West 55th Street \u2014 Avenue of the Americas Plaza \u2014 for $270 million, half the asking price from early 2020.\nThe building is currently half empty, with vacancies concentrated on the higher floors.\nThe listing price reflects a trend in the Manhattan office market where buildings are still trading at discounts due to high interest rates and the costs of attracting tenants, even as overall leasing activity is recovering.\n\nWhile Jamie Dimon is looking to dispose of an office building, Meyer Chetrit isn\u2019t willing to let go of assets that could be used in a judgment against him \u2014 at least that\u2019s what\u2019s being alleged.\nMaverick Real Estate Partners\nclaims\nMeyer Chetrit is fraudulently shielding assets to evade a $132 million judgement.\nA lawsuit filed by Maverick focuses on a debt document between Chetrit and business partner Gadi Ben Hamo, which Maverick claims is a false attempt to remove assets.\nBen Hamo denied the allegations, stating the debt is legitimate and that Maverick is trying to acquire debt at a discount. Ben Hamo is considering a counterclaim.\nFinally, Silver Creek Development\nacquired the lease\nfor the former Ritz-Carlton hotel, rebranded as the Wagner in 2018, in Battery Park City after a three-year bankruptcy process.\nThe previous owners, Taylor Woods and Howard Wu of Urban Commons, accumulated significant debts and faced multiple legal issues, including charges of fraud and misappropriation of funds.\nWoods and Wu were removed from controlling the hotel\u2019s debtor entity and ultimately received no proceeds from the bankruptcy sale, where Silver Creek emerged as the sole bidder.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a mantra often repeated to the parents of young children. The phrase is especially true if you\u2019re living in a cramped New York City apartment in the dead of winter with restless toddlers. Michael Schoen and Chris de Koos are hoping to capitalize on that.\nTheir company, Little Big Hospitality,\ninked a 15-year, 45,000-square-foot lease\nthis summer at CIM Group\u2019s long-vacant office building at 50 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. The firm plans to use the space to open The Beginning Clubhouse,\na private family-oriented club\nthat will offer curated programming and classes for children, childcare, food and beverage options, and fitness and wellness amenities.\nSchoen, a Brooklyn dad with a background in commercial real estate, said he got the idea for the business during his family\u2019s temporary relocation to London. There, he joined a small club where parents could drop off young children for classes and playtime while slipping away for a sauna or spa treatment.\n\u201cThat was kind of when the light bulb went off,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018how does this space not exist in New York?\u2019\u201d\nThe seven-story clubhouse will merge the best of adult-focused clubs like Soho House with the needs of families. Plans call for a rooftop pizza oven and garden, a screening room and bowling alley. U.K. design firm Tigerplay is designing a custom indoor jungle gym. There will also be a restaurant and bar.\n\u201cWe want this to be a place where you can come for date night, or meet friends, just as much as you can bring the whole family,\u201d Schoen said.\nThe choice of 50 Columbia Heights is as much about real estate as it is about lifestyle. The 1920s brick and timber structure once belonged to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as part of their vast Brooklyn Heights campus.\nCIM Group acquired it in 2016\nalong with the rest of the five-building complex. Built into the side of a hill, the property is connected to Furman Street by a dramatic steel staircase that leads to a garden. But CIM never found a tenant.\nThe lease marks a turning point. Brooklyn\u2019s office market has lagged Manhattan\u2019s recovery, and much of the Panorama development was caught up in the pandemic\u2019s work-from-home fallout.\n\u201cThis revitalizes it with a use that feels like a home run, given the density in the area and how families already use Brooklyn Bridge Park as their backyard,\u201d said Dan Marks, CEO of Brooklyn brokerage TerraCRG.\nThe concept appears to be striking a chord. The Beginning has already drawn more than 1,500 membership applications, surpassing the expected cap of 1,200 families. Schoen envisions the Columbia Heights building as the flagship, but says interest is already coming from other cities like Chicago and Nashville.\nBut for now, he\u2019s focused on Brooklyn.\n\u201cBrooklyn is home, and this is where it begins,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNew York City\u2019s hotel market is on fire, according to several brokers I\u2019ve spoken with and a\nrecent Wall Street Journal\narticle. So why do\nmany owners\nseem to be\nstruggling\n? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThere will soon be more private money spent on the construction of data centers than office buildings. While office construction spending has declined significantly since 2019, data center spending has surged, reaching an annual rate of nearly $40 billion in mid-2025, compared with $44.17 billion on office space, according U.S. Census Bureau data. Not surprisingly, the rise is largely driven by AI and cloud computing.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2013 Gov. Kathy Hochul declared this the safest summer for New York\u2019s subways in 15 years, according to the\nNew York Times\n. There were 480 major crimes \u2013\u00a0 which include robbery, burglary, grand larceny, assault, murder and rape \u2013 recorded in the subway from June to August, a 9 percent drop compared with the same period last year and the fewest since at least 2009, the governor\u2019s office told the Times. Felony assault fell to 31 incidents in August from 52 the same month last year.\n\u2014 The killings of a couple in their 70s shocked their Queens neighborhood after a fire set by their killer consumed their home of more than 40 years. Prosecutors said Friday they had tracked down Jamel McGriff, the man accused of killing Frank and Maureen Olton, after he used the victims\u2019 credit card to pay for items that he bought with his own Macy\u2019s loyalty card number,\nNBC 4 reported\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$15 million\nfor 330 Spring Street, 12A. The Hudson Square condo unit at The Urban Glass House is 4,300 square feet. The last on-market sale of the unit was in 2007, when it sold for $11.2 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7.3 million\nfor 208 Centre Street. The mixed-use rental building in Little Italy is five stories and 12,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29 million for 18 East 71st Street. The Lenox Hill townhome has seven floors and is 13,000 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nAdam Schneider has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 32,507-square-foot, three-story, mixed-use building at 1677 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Architect Richard Bienenfeld is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority is bleeding senior talent, with its human resources chief the latest to head for the exits.\nDominick Maniscalco, who has served as CHA\u2019s deputy chief of HR since 2021, resigned the first week of September to become chief HR officer for Milwaukee Public Schools. He is the ninth senior leader to leave the nation\u2019s third-largest housing authority in the past year, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nIn an email to staff, Maniscalco praised colleagues\u2019 \u201cdedication and talent\u201d and said he was proud of how the department had moved HR forward since 2021. He declined further comment. CHA spokesperson Matthew Aguilar confirmed the resignation but declined to elaborate, citing personnel rules.\nManiscalco\u2019s exit follows a string of high-level shakeups at the agency, which oversees more than 65,000 households and owns more than 21,000 public housing units across Chicago. Former CEO Tracey Scott left\nearlier\nthis year, while other leaders \u2014 including chief development officer Ann McKenzie and chief of staff Dan Cruz \u2014 were terminated without public explanation. Former COO Eric Garrett resigned in January, and general counsel Ellen Harris stepped down in August after staff accused her of fostering a\ntoxic workplace\n.\n\nThe turnover has proven costly. CHA paid out more than $787,000 in\nseparation agreements\nto senior staff over the past five years.

        "content": "Riaz Capital bought an apartment complex in downtown Berkeley for 20 percent under the property\u2019s assessed value amid a wave of distress in the market.\nAn affiliate of the Oakland-based real estate manager bought the Dwight apartments for $37.8 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That works out to $381,600 per unit for the 99-unit property at 2121 Dwight Way. The seller\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe multifamily market in the Bay Area, particularly the East Bay, hit a patch of rough waters over the past year. While some properties are trading hands, albeit at lower prices than their assessed values, many property owners have fallen into loan default and faced foreclosure.\nSlow job growth when apartment development has outpaced demand is part of the problem, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap. Higher vacancy rates across the Bay Area have weakened rental levels in certain areas, creating financial hurdles for apartment owners attempting to repay mortgages.\n\nSo far this month, several multifamily properties in the region have traded hands.\nLast week, the 230-unit\nLINQ\napartments in San Jose sold for $97.6 million, or more than $424,000 per unit. The buyer was a joint venture between Ethos Real Estate and Prospect Ridge, and the seller was an affiliate of Stockbridge Capital Group, which acquired the property for $104 million in 2019.\nAn Acacia Capital affiliate bought the Waymark apartment complex in Walnut Creek, dropping $190 million, or nearly $531,000 per unit, for the 358-unit property. Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, the firms that developed the complex, sold the 2022-built property. That deal placed Waymark\u2019s value at 15.1 percent lower than its estimated value of $223.8 million.\nEarlier this month, Sack Capital Partners and Las Palmas Housing bought the 164-unit\nFountain Park\napartments in San Jose for $52 million, or $317,000 per unit. And a Greystar affiliate sold the 948-unit\nPark Kiely\napartment complex in San Jose to Standard Communities, Housing on Merit and Vistria Real Estate for $370 million, or $390,300 per unit. That marked the highest amount paid for a multifamily property in Santa Clara County so far this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Southwestern University quietly cashed in on its vast real estate holdings, fattening its endowment and putting it in the driver\u2019s seat of a 560 acre development set to expand the reach of its campus in Georgetown.\nThe 185-year-old liberal arts school amassed holdings in the thousands of acres \u2014 more than any other private college in Texas \u2014 over the course of decades, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. One tract donated in the 1930s sold for $28 million during the pandemic boom.\nSouthwestern started selling after an audit of its real estate portfolio five years ago, and its endowment has grown $377 million, up from $289 million four years ago, with proceeds largely earmarked for financial aid.\nThe university held back a massive parcel east of campus, where it is advancing plans for a mixed-use district called Southwestern University 560, envisioned as a \u201cmini city\u201d with housing, offices, retail, restaurants, a boutique hotel, cultural spaces and a concert venue. The City of\nGeorgetown\n, about 30 miles north of Austin, has agreed to build a service center there for 275 city employees.\nSouthwestern tapped Austin-based Banbury Development \u2014 best known for\nco-master-planning\nthe 700-acre Mueller redevelopment in East Austin \u2014 to lead the project. The first phase is slated to hit Georgetown\u2019s\nplanning\ncommission this month, with horizontal infrastructure work targeted for completion by next year.\nThe design process has leaned heavily on community input. A 20-member task force of students, faculty and alumni, along with a packed town hall, pushed for a blend of career-building opportunities, cultural amenities and environmental preservation.\n\nOnly 325 acres will be developed, and 70 acres will remain open as an \u201ceco gateway\u201d with creeks, floodplains and trails.\nLaura Skandera Trombley, president of the university, previously ran Pitzer College and the Huntington Library in California. She framed the project as a chance to cement Southwestern\u2019s unique identity in a fast-growing region, noting that no other liberal arts college in the United States has this type of opportunity.\nGreg Weaver, CEO of Banbury, said the mixed-use development could attract unique retail and corporate headquarters.\nWilliamson County has been one of the\nhottest\ngrowth markets in Texas, and corporate tenants are already scouting for campus-like settings with retail and residential built in. The 560 could be a financial engine and a recruiting tool for Southwestern University as well \u2014 a town-and-gown experiment at a metropolitan scale.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Weeks ago\nThe Real Deal\nbroke the story that a\ndeal\nto sell the Brookfield-owned EY Plaza to Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld fell through, putting the\nnon-preforming loan\ntied to the 920,000-square-foot tower back on the market.\nThen came our scoop that a deal for 811 Wilshire also fell out, leaving Jamison in default and facing\nforeclosure\non the 337,000-square-foot property.\nThere\u2019s no telling what next week will bring \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned to TRD, as usual \u2014 but it does appear that local Jamison is in better shape than global Brookfield as far as the two downtown L.A. property values go. The debt connected to 811 Wilshire stands at about $35 million, compared to the original $39 million note that matured and moved to special servicing last year. Jamison bought the property in the early 2000s for $26.5 million. It was valued at $68 million when the current loan was originated in 2014, and it\u2019s been appraised at $40.5 million more recently.\nEY Plaza, on the other hand, fell out of its deal with Carolwood at $130 million. That explains why the $275 million note on the property is being marketed at a discount.\nBackup plan for Original Pantry?\nLeo Pustilnikov of Builders Remedy fame \u2014 AKA the guy who beat the Beverly Hills NIMBY crowd \u2014 might have a backup plan if his out-of-blue buy of the Original Pantry just up Figueroa from LA Live leaves him disenchanted with the restaurant business.\nPustilnikov told KABC Radio\u2019s Frank Mottek on the day of his reported $5.5 million deal for the recently shuttered restaurant \u2014 a longstanding asset in late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan\u2019s portfolio \u2014 that it\u2019s a pure dining play.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming back, the workers are coming back, the Pantry is coming back,\u201d touted the eclectic Pustilnikov, who also has significant holdings of commercial real estate from Huntington Beach to Skid Row.\n\nPustilnikov can look about a block away for a different potential for the prime location the Original Pantry occupies at 9th Street and Fig \u2014 and note that 9th Street is known as James M. Wood Boulevard for a stretch just east of Figueroa. By any name, however, Pustilnikov can hardly miss the 2.3-acre open patch of land at 9th and Francisco streets, especially now that it\u2019s got a\nprice tag\nof $100 million.\nThe land, owned by nonprofit Salvation Army, spans 832 and 900 James M. Wood Boulevard and 916 and 927 Francisco Street, plus another commercial parcel. It\u2019s near LA Live, two Marriott-branded hotels, the Grammy Museum and Los Angeles Convention Center.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Catherine Bassick holds the private listing that is described as entitled to become a \u201cskyline-defining landmark,\u201d in sales materials. There\u2019s no height limit, so that could be true.\nThe land could become a mixed-use residential tower with retail space and rooftop amenities, or a hotel or a creative campus for corporate headquarters, if the buyer goes with any of the scenarios laid out in the sales materials.\nAbout that bonus\nA couple months ago, Hudson Pacific Properties announced it was cutting two board members, who the company said voluntarily resigned.\n\u201cThis more efficient board structure maintains the experience needed to guide our management team while contributing to our ongoing focus on corporate costs to drive value creation for shareholders,\u201d chief executive and chairman Victor Coleman said.\nThat\u2019s the same Coleman who made about $25 million in total compensation, a substantial boost compared to the $8 million or so he made the year before. As\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n, his base salary remained at $1 million, but his discretionary and non-discretionary cash bonuses and stock awards increased to encourage retention, stockholder alignment and stock price recovery. His stock awards were valued at about $22 million. That was despite ballooning losses that have only\ncontinued to mount\nand shares trading under $3.\n",

The loans matured last year, and the firm owed $10.7 million in interest as of last month.\nThe firm\u2019s co-founders, Jon and Ashley Venetos, personally guaranteed the loans, meaning they could be on the hook to pay if their firm can\u2019t cough up the dough.\nLurin lost 12 properties to foreclosure in Florida earlier this year, when Acore Capital Mortgage foreclosed on $383.6 million in loans and auctioned off the property. The firm is also poised to lose the 592-unit Estates at Avenstar in Houston, which\nhit the auction block\nearlier this month, after the firm defaulted on a $52.5 million mortgage from Nexstar.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\n\nThe new Texas law aimed at reforming the use of \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporations in affordable housing deals drew a lawsuit,\nas predicted\n. The Texas Workforce Housing Coalition\nsued in a challenge to the constitutionality\nof House Bill 21.

Critics of HB 21 claim it overreaches and undermines local control, while supporters see it as a necessary fix to prevent abuse of tax exemptions.\nAres Real Estate\nswooped into Fort Worth\nwith a massive industrial acquisition.

It more recently has sold off more than $400 million worth of its portfolio to Nvidia. The chipmaker\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed more than 10-fold in the past three years, with the AI boom driving its market capitalization past $4 trillion, helping finance the growth that has prompted the recent buying binge on office properties.\nThe latest exhibit of the trend came last week when Nvidia added\n2701 San Tomas Expressway\nto its hometown portfolio for $83.2 million. Sobrato sold the 125,000-square-foot building, which was developed with three other buildings that form an office complex at the Santa Clara site.\nOther recent sales by Sobrato to Nvidia include a May deal for the three other buildings in the complex on San Tomas Expressway for $254 million. Each structure has about 125,000 square feet of space, and all four buildings are situated around Nvidia\u2019s headquarters at 2788 San Tomas Expressway.\nAlso in May, Nvidia\nbought a 10-building\n, 13-acre office and research campus from Sobrato at 2348 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, across the street from its HQ, for $123 million. In July, it purchased another property at 2740 Scott Boulevard, adjacent to the four-building office complex, for $4.5 million.\nSobrato\u2019s take of more than $400 million indicates the developer is tops on dollar volume when it comes to property sales to Nvidia, but Prelock Holdings appears to take the cake for biggest single deal. Los Angeles-based Preylock got $374 million from the chipmaker in May 2024 for its 557,000-square foot\nheadquarters\nlast year.\nThe newest new \u2018normal\u2019\nBreak out the air quotes because housing prices in San Francisco have returned to \u201cnormal.\u201d\nAt least that\u2019s the analysis of real estate brokerage\nRedfin\n. The firm published a report noting that\nhousing prices in the city\nare back at July 2018 levels \u2014 the last time the city\u2019s real estate market could be defined as \u201cnormal.\u201d\nTo make its calculations, Redfin used a mortgage payment-to-income ratio, coming to the estimate that homes now cost about as much as they did before the pandemic relative to residents\u2019 annual income.\nThe median home price in San Francisco has increased 8 percent since July 2018 \u2014 a stark difference from the national median price surging 56 percent over the same time period. Annual household incomes in San Francisco have grown 7.7 percent, nearly double the 3.9 percent yearly increase across the country.\nAcross the Bay, Oakland isn\u2019t far behind in returning to so-called normalcy. The East Bay city is poised to return to \u201cnormal\u201d housing prices this month if prices remain stable or decline. By contrast, no other metro area in the U.S. is expected to reach \u201cnormal\u201d levels until Austin in March 2027.\nUsing the same 6.7 percent mortgage rate calculation, Sacramento will return to \u201cnormal\u201d in November 2028, San Diego in February 2029 and San Jose in May 2029. The projections don\u2019t consider property taxes or insurance costs for California homeowners more heavily.\nResidents in Orange County are seemingly out of luck, with no return to \u201cnormal\u201d expected there, according to Redfin\u2019s calculations. Home prices in much of OC have gone up by so much that it would be virtually impossible to return to pre-pandemic levels, even over the next decade.\nOceanwide finds a buyer\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Oceanwide Center, the similarly abandoned sibling of Los Angeles\u2019\nOceanwide Plaza\n, appears to have found a buyer.\nDan Kingsley, co-founder of Bay Area development firm SKS Partners, is in contract to buy the development at 50 First Street. Kingsley and private equity alum Jay Yang are reportedly in talks with Haitong International, a lender on the project that\nseized it in 2021\nfrom developer Oceanwide Holdings.\nWhen construction began on the project in 2016, the goal was to build two high-rises with offices, condominiums and a high-end hotel and complete construction in 2020. The 2-million-square-foot project came to a halt after Oceanwide Holdings\u2019 financial issues and debt became impossible to overcome. The total cost of the development effort was valued at $1.6 billion.\nThe long gap since any work has been done on the project means that Iingsley and Yang, or another buyer would have to apply for permit renewals with the Department of Building Inspection even if they choose to stick with the current entitlements on the property.\nA curious CEQA proposal\nCalifornia lawmakers are seeking an\noddly specific legislative carveout\nin Santa Barbara.\nThe newly introduced Senate Bill 158 calls for subjecting any project within a city of more than 85,000 but fewer than 95,000 residents and within a county of between 440,000 and 455,000 people to undergo environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, which received a\nmajor overhaul in July\nas exemptions for environmental reviews were expanded. The bill also aims to prevent CEQA exemptions to any projects next to a wetland, a creek and a state-registered historical landmark, as well as any projects larger than four acres and those that use\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\nfor development.\nThat criteria narrows it down to just one project in the whole state: A 270-unit, eight-story residential building proposed for construction behind Santa Barbara\u2019s historic Old Mission.\nThe district is represented by Sen. Monique Lim\u00f3n, the incoming leader of the State Senate. Lim\u00f3n denied that she\u2019s out to prevent the development with the legislation.\nMore multifamily properties trade hands\nYet another multifamily property in San Jose has traded hands.\nThe 230-unit\nLINQ apartments\nat 1700 Newbury Park Drive sold to a joint venture between Ethos Real Estate and Prospect Ridge for $97.6 million. The seller was an affiliate of Stockbridge Capital Group, which acquired the property for about $104 million in 2019.\nThe complex is near San Jose\u2019s Berryessa BART station, which is set to transform with new commercial and residential developments surrounding the station. The progress of\nSB 79\nin the state legislature could boost further development around transit hubs throughout the Bay Area if passed.\nMeanwhile, in Walnut Creek, Acacia Capital bought the 358-unit\nWaymark apartment complex\nat 101 Pringle Avenue for $190 million. The sellers were Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, the firms that developed the complex. The purchase price was 15.1 percent below Waymark\u2019s estimated value of the property of $223.8 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "From luxury North Shore homes trading at steep discounts to zoning battles in Fulton Market and a lawsuit in the Loop, Chicago\u2019s real estate scene moved through a few scrapes and bold bets this week.\nA\nlakefront Kenilworth estate once listed for $14 million\nsold for just $6.8 million Thursday. With the new owners planning to demolish the 11,000-square-foot mansion on 1.6 acres along Sheridan Road, the deal highlights that even in exclusive areas, buyers are looking for move-in ready properties.\nElsewhere on the North Shore, Highland Park boxed out the\nself-storage investor who rebounded Michael Jordan\u2019s former mansion\nat a huge discount. The new owner, John Cooper, had intended to convert the estate into a\ntimeshare-like property, offering a one-week annual stay\nof \u201cChampions Point\u201d for $1 million. However, local authorities\nbanned timeshares in the town\nthis week, leaving Cooper with a high-value property that now looks more like a conventional resale than a reinvented business model.\nTurbulence continues to jolt Chicago\u2019s affordable housing system. The\nChicago Housing Authority lost another senior executive this week\n, with HR chief Dominick Maniscalco walking away for a job with Milwaukee Public Schools. He\u2019s the ninth top CHA official to depart in a year, and the agency remains\nwithout a permanent CEO amid a delay to the appointment\nof Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s choice to fill the role, former alderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n\nIn Fulton Market, deals and disputes are heating up. Waterton paid\n$89.5 million for The Mason\n, a 263-unit rental tower at 180 North Ada Street, removing one option for investors out of a\nlong list of Chicago multifamily assets\ncurrently listed for sale.\nJust a few blocks away,\nDomus Real Estate Group has to push harder\n. Its plan for a 30-story, 347-unit tower at 215 North Racine is colliding with city zoning limits. Domus wants to pump the floor-area ratio to 24 times the size of the lot \u2014\na bold ask\nby Fulton Market standards. Officials suggested additional land acquisition to soften the bonus density, but neighbors worry that the next chapter for the corridor could look less like loft conversions and more like Loop towers.\nThere\u2019s always action in the Loop, where a fight is brewing that involves city subsidies going into the\nLaSalle Street Reimagined\noffice-to-residential conversion program.\nCeladon Partners is sparring with its ex-partner Primera Group\n, alleging it got cut out of a deal to turn much of the Clark Adams Building into apartments, underscoring how developer alliances can quickly turn contentious.\nIn the southwest suburbs,\nJSB Capital Group\nwrapped up a\n$65 million multifamily purchase\nthat helped end a messy legal fight between Kansas City-based lender 7 Acre Investments and the developer of the property in New Lenox. JSB bought Lincoln Station, a 220-unit complex, after its builder Richard Gammonley, allegedly defaulted on a rescue capital loan from 7 Acre.\nAnd in\nChicago\u2019s Pullman neighborhood\n, the city approved a $30 million Hampton by Hilton project, bringing 101 hotel rooms to the Far South Side with the first lodging development in the area in decades. The hotel is being touted as more than just a project: it\u2019s a marker of outside capital finally staking a claim in an area long overlooked by mainstream development.",

        "content": "The lecturing came hot and heavy this week.\nGovernment leaders took\nHuntington\nBeach and Artesia to task as the state cracks down on jurisdictions that can\u2019t \u2014 some might say won\u2019t \u2014 get in compliance with housing laws.\nGov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta claimed victory on Friday, when a California court of appeals ruled in their favor, forcing\nHuntington Beach\nto get a compliant housing element done in 120 days.\nThe Orange County city locked horns with the state a few years ago after failing to approve plans that outline how it will address housing needs in the long term across income levels in what\u2019s known as a housing element.\n\u201cToday\u2019s win is an important development,\u201d Bonta said of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cHuntington Beach is running out of excuses, and the consequences for failing to plan for its fair share of housing are becoming clearer and more serious.\u201d\nThe lecturing followed Artesia\u2019s settlement with the state on Tuesday. After falling out of compliance by not having a housing element completed in 2023, the city now has until January to figure out how it\u2019ll accommodate 1,069 more housing units.\nNewsom accused Artesia of \u201cwasted time and money,\u201d while California Department of Housing and Community Development Director Gustavo Velasquez brought up cities\u2019 \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d when it comes to housing in the Huntington Beach ruling.\nSome local jurisdictions say they are struggling to meet the housing targets while balancing local and state regulations around development.\nMorality and legal compliance. They\u2019re two different conversations happening in the context of a single subject. As is so often the case, that leaves little room for common ground.\n\u2026 and cue builder\u2019s remedy\nA builder\u2019s remedy project in\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nresulted in several years of litigation, but the city backed down from its fight in March, after a judge ordered the town to post a $14 million bond if it wanted to continue fighting against Cedar Street Partners\u2019 mixed-use project at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\nPlans call for about 7,200 square feet of office and 80 dwelling units, of which eight would be affordable and 16 for hospitality. The firm is seeking development entitlements at city hall as well as $6 million in legal costs in court.\nCedar Street managing member Jonathan Curtis called the city\u2019s development pushback \u201cbewildering.\u201d Whether the project is now on a fast track to getting approvals remains to be seen. It\u2019s set to go before the planning commission on Sept. 18 and city council Oct. 2.\n\nBond Street\u2019s shakeup\nDavid Parnes and James Harris\n, founders of the Bond Street Partners team at Carolwood Estates, are splitting as business partners.\nDetails on what will happen with the nine other agents on their team or if the Bond Street name will be dissolved are not yet known. The two declined to say anything beyond their prepared Instagram message.\nThe announcement, they said, marks the \u201cnext chapter\u201d for their business, one that\u2019s swelled in recent years to make Bond Street RealTrends\u2019 No. 1-ranked medium team in the U.S. with $940 million in volume.\nLuka snags Sharapova\u2019s pad\nOceanfront neighborhood The Strand gets all the attention, but how about that Hill Section? That\u2019s where Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\npaid $25 million for tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s custom build.\nCarolwood Estate\u2019s Sus\u00e2n Perryman was the listing agent, and it appears the property traded off market.\nThe purchase price pushed past 1800 The Strand to be Manhattan Beach\u2019s most expensive home sale ever. The Strand property claimed the record last July when the beachfront property sold for $24.5 million.\nBrad Pitt retools property portfolio, again\nTwo-time Oscar winner\nBrad Pitt\nshuffled the deck on his real estate holdings yet again.\nThe actor sold his Los Feliz home, known locally as The Steel House, in an off-market deal on Friday. Sources told\nTRD\nthe asking price was $5.5 million. What the home actually closed at is not yet known. If the purchase price was less than $5.3 million, Pitt will have managed to bypass paying the contentious Measure ULA two-tier tax on real estate deals.\nPitt\u2019s agents Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays of Carolwood Estates represented the A-lister in his latest trade.\n",

        "content": "Four years after the Surfside condo collapse, families of the 98 people who died still don\u2019t know why the building toppled. It will be at least another year before they get answers.\nThis means the Champlain Towers South investigation will take longer than the probes into the collapse of the Florida International University pedestrian bridge in 2018 and the\nWorld Trade Center twin towers\nin 2001. With more than $40 million allocated so far, the Surfside investigation also is costlier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years, 98 dead. And there\u2019s no answers and no accountability,\u201d Martin Langesfeld, whose sister and brother-in-law died in the collapse, told Surfside commissioners on Tuesday.\nLangesfeld\u2019s comments came hours after the National Institute of Standards and Technology presented its preliminary findings.\nSo far, evidence shows the collapse beginning in the pool deck, which started to cave in at least\nseven minutes\nbefore the tower toppled. Investigators said the pool deck\u2019s design wasn\u2019t up to code, and slab reinforcements weren\u2019t placed per design requirements. Nearly all of the deck\u2019s construction joints didn\u2019t have steel reinforcement dowels, and the concrete \u201ckeys\u201d in the joints were either improperly built or missing, NIST\u2019s Glenn Bell said. This could have allowed for water to seep in, leading to corrosion and cracking of slab reinforcements.\nInvestigators also outlined a slew of issues that appeared at\nChamplain\nbefore the collapse. Hours before the tragedy, a water drip turned into a \u201cfaucet,\u201d investigators said, likely referring to a\nwidely circulated video\nthat shows water gushing into the underground garage. Weeks before that, a gate between the pool deck and street-level parking deck jammed, and about a month prior, a sliding glass door came off its tracks.\nNotably, the location of some of these issues coincides with the placement of improperly built construction joints, investigators said.\nNIST, which originally expected to release its final report this year, says draft reports will be submitted next year.\n\u201cWe share the public\u2019s desire to have answers,\u201d said NIST\u2019s Judith Mitrani-Reiser, \u201cand what we can do to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nNIST, in a statement, said it \u201cshared from the beginning of this investigation that it would be especially complex, given the lack of any obvious cause, such as a fire or plane crash.\u201d\nBut the delays are frustrating and painful to family members.\nLangesfeld agreed that the investigation is vital for the safety of condo residents across Florida. Someone has to answer for the failures at Champlain, he added.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy requires criminal accountability. Who developed and constructed this building? Who approved this building? There are many potential parties that must be investigated,\u201d he told town commissioners. \u201cThis was not a natural disaster, this was not a hurricane. This was a preventable human error.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMichael Shvo sold one Miami Beach development site in a deal we heard was close to the amount of the loan backing the property. He is still trying to\nhang onto\nthe Raleigh assemblage. What\u2019s going on with his One Soundscape Park property? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Ex-Apple CEO John Sculley and his wife, Diane, sold an oceanfront estate at\n1214 North Ocean Boulevard\nin Palm Beach for $37 million. The buyer was Chestnut Park Holdings LLC.\nCommercial\n: The purchase price for the Bikini Hostel at 1247 West Avenue, scooped up by Michael Stern\u2019s JDS and David Martin\u2019s Terra, hit records this week, coming in at $20 million. The acquisition was part of a\nlarger, $120 million development site\nthat includes the bulk purchase of Bay Garden Manor at 1250 West Avenue, where the developers plan to construct a waterfront condo tower.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe oceanfront estate at 1610 North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach\nhit the market\nfor $65 million. The nearly 9,800-square-foot mansion, with six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms, was built in 2018 on a 0.9-acre lot. It\u2019s on the market with Margit Brandt of Premier Estate Properties. Records show it last sold in 2019 for $25.5 million.\nObituaries\nLast week, we reported on the death of Douglas Elliman agent\nDarin Tansey\n, who was found dead at his condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach, at the age of 50. We also learned that\nDanny Zelonker\n, a commercial broker who focused on industrial real estate, died in August. He was 75.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA Florida appeals court struck down the state\u2019s decades-old ban on openly carrying firearms, citing recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings,\nPolitico\nreports. The ruling reverses prior precedent and could have major implications for gun laws and tourism in the state.\nThe Miami-Dade School Board voted to sue South Florida Public Media Group, which manages the public radio station WLRN, over its $6.5 million purchase of a station in West Palm Beach,\nWLRN\nreports.\nThe Z Ocean Hotel in South Beach was shut down after months of unpaid electricity bills, prompting the Miami Beach Fire Department to evacuate the building even though it was already vacant. It\u2019s unclear if the closure is temporary or permanent, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.",

        "content": "Fashion week in New York City is a stressful time for designers showcasing their latest lines in the hopes that shoppers will buy what they\u2019re selling.\nBut fashion designer Jill Stuart has already cashed in on her latest product \u2014 a Soho penthouse, which she sold for $15 million, according to public records filed with the city this week.\nStuart bought the condo for $11.2 million in 2007, and was originally seeking $24.5 million when it hit the market in July 2023. The home underwent a series of price cuts and was last asking $16 million when it went into contract in June, according to StreetEasy.\nModlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Compass\u2019 Nick Gavin shared the listing.\nCompleted in 2005, the 12-story, 40-unit building at 330 Spring Street was\narchitect Philip Johnson\n\u2019s last project before his death.\nWith interiors designed by Annabelle Selldorf, the full-floor five-bedroom features two terraces totaling almost 1,600 square feet and 360-degree exposures from floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. From a private elevator landing, a foyer leads into the open-layout living and dining rooms, which are separated from a western media room.\nAn eat-in kitchen with two islands, two full-size fridges and a wine fridge is on the eastern side of the unit. The western and southern sides of the penthouse hold bedroom suites that can be closed off from public areas. Four of the five bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms; two of the bedroom suites share jack-and-jill bathrooms, each with a soaking tub and stall shower.\n\nThe primary suite has its own terrace, a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom with a soaking tub and double vanity.\nStuart is not the first artful resident in the striking building, which was named in homage to Johnson\u2019s original Glass Building in New Canaan, Conn. Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic purchased a two-bedroom condo for\n$2.65 million in 2013\n.\nStuart, who has been spending more time in Paris per a friend quoted in the New York Post, also sold her Sagaponack estate for\n$9.4 million in 2023\n. The 5,000-square-foot farmhouse sat on a 1.6-acre property, which came with a pool house with its own gym, a gas fire pit, Jacuzzi and four-car garage.\nStuart, whose parents owned a sportswear brand that dressed celebrities like Natalie Wood and Lucille Ball in the 1960s and 1970s, attended the prestigious Dalton School in the city and sold her first collection of accessories while there at the age of 15 to Bloomingdale\u2019s.\nHer fashion empire later expanded rapidly, and she has dressed celebrities like Kerry Washington, Elizabeth Banks and Jessica Biel.\nThe recent sales still may be of help to Stuart, who claimed in court that her now ex-husband lost $25 million mishandling a family trust.\n",

        "content": "For about three years, New York affordable housing developers had access to a program that gave them a little wiggle room when things were tight. Now, that program has been paused, and its chances of returning are slim.\nThe program, called Section 610, allowed landlords to collect the full value of a federal rent voucher when it was more than the rent. But money came from the federal Section 8 program.\nIn March, when Section 8 funding appeared in jeopardy, the city\npaused authorizations\n. In July, New York State\u2019s housing department seemed to put the final nail in the coffin, ending authorizations for landlords who receive certain city subsidies.\nAdvocates for affordable housing developers and landlords are looking to both federal and local authorities to fund the program as expenses grow.\nDiminishing collections, rising costs\nSamantha Magistro, CEO at affordable housing developer Bronx Pro Group, has applied to the program for 15 different projects. Her first 10 requests were granted, giving her portfolio some room to breathe. But her most recent five requests have yet to be processed.\nMagistro, who chairs the board of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, said her concern is for smaller and nonprofit developers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have this really important tool to help increase income and help them pay the most important bills,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your expenses are more than your income, it\u2019s hard to spend on that extra paint job or do all the repairs that an owner might want to do.\u201d\nLaunched in 2022, Section 610 was aimed at projects facing financial difficulties. Certain building owners who had agreements with the city to limit rent could demonstrate financial need.\u00a0 With a Section 610 authorization, they could amend their agreements upon lease renewal to collect the full amount of a federal voucher, without changing costs for tenants.\nAt Bronx Pro Group, that made a difference. Expenses have risen sharply, especially in insurance costs. Rent collections have been more sporadic than expected. Projects were underwritten with the assumption they would collect 95 percent of the rent, a conservative projection before 2020. Now, collections stand around 93 percent, Magistro said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for close to 25 years, and my father longer before that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve seen our portfolio really distressed.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s older projects were less able to withstand those expense and income shocks. Magistro can still collect the full voucher amount on those buildings where her applications were already approved.\n\n\u201cWe feel pretty confident that 610 is going to help us support getting those portfolios out of financial distress,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very proactive.\u201d\nBut newer buildings in the portfolio can struggle too, faced with a difficult interest rate environment and unexpectedly low collections.\n\u201cMost affordable housing developers are mission-based,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us aren\u2019t looking for some kind of boondoggle profit here, but we are looking to make sure that we can operate sufficiently and be compensated for the work that we do.\u201d\nSolutions stuck in bureaucracy\nFederal budget negotiations are deadlocked in Congress, which has until September 30 to avoid a government shutdown. The Senate has proposed raising funding for Section 8 by about 4 percent, while the House has proposed flat funding.\nUnless funding for Section 8 is increased during federal budget negotiations, Section 610 is unlikely to be revived. Even flat funding, which is typical for short-term funding bills, may not be enough to bring back authorizations, said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference.\n\u201cAs rents go up, if you don\u2019t add additional appropriation, you\u2019re serving fewer households,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really at the mercy of what happens in Washington.\u201d\nSome have been looking for solutions closer to home.\nThe New York Apartment Association has been lobbying for a state pilot program that would allow owners of rent-stabilized housing to collect full voucher amounts when they\u2019re more than the legal rent, according to executive vice president Jay Martin. The expansion would incentivize landlords to rent out vacant apartments and specifically to tenants with vouchers, who they otherwise might avoid. The provisions was included in a state senate bill\nintroduced in March\n, but is still in committee.\n\u201cIt was a proposal that we thought was going to get broad support and build off the momentum of 610,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did not move.\u201d\nIf New York wants to address housing challenges, he said, it needs to fund solutions.\n\u201cWe keep telling property owners and, obviously, these poor people in shelters that getting them into permanent housing is the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we try to do it on the cheap.\u201d\n",

Cawley Partners recently\nacquired\nSouth Creek Ranch and plans to build data centers, manufacturing and logistics on the former cattle operation. Undeveloped ranches often become profitable as\nhunting destinations\nif they can\u2019t sustain cattle operations.\nImprovements on the Two Rivers include a manager\u2019s house, several stocked tanks, a shooting range, a new shop and a four-bedroom main house fronting a creek that runs through the property.\n",

        "content": "A local development team pulled together nearly $100 million to build an apartment tower in the West Loop, one of the few major ground-up projects moving forward in Chicago\u2019s otherwise sluggish multifamily pipeline.\nA joint venture of Focus Development, Melrose Ascension Capital and DAC Developments scored $71.6 million in construction financing from CIBC and $23.9 million in preferred equity from Heitman, , Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The partners plan a 19-story, 287-unit building at 1221 West Washington Boulevard, just south of Fulton Market.\nThe $96 million package is a rare win in a market where high interest rates and rising costs have stalled downtown projects. The development was initially pegged at $100 million when proposed in 2021. Tim Anderson, CEO of Focus, said landing debt and equity wasn\u2019t easy, but he said Chicago\u2019s apartment fundamentals are compelling, as the market has strong demand and a lack of supply.\nDesigned with smaller-format units, the glass-and-brick tower will target renters priced out of Fulton Market\u2019s\nluxury\nstock. Rents are expected to start at $1,800 a month. The project will also include 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and is slated for completion in late 2026.\n\nThe deal marks only the second major downtown resi development to secure financing in more than a year. Vista Property Group\nbroke\nthat drought in May with $173 million for a 31-story tower at 370 North Morgan Street. With deliveries thin until at least 2027, Class A landlords downtown are enjoying leverage: average net rents jumped 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nFocus is a\nveteran\nFulton Market player, having co-developed The Parker apartments and 167 North Green Street\u2019s office tower. Its partners are also busy downtown: DAC and MAC recently started construction on a separate 19-story South Loop rental project with a\njoint\n$69 million construction loan.\nFor the West Loop, the tower adds to a neighborhood buzzing with office-to-residential conversions and corporate relocations. Anderson called Fulton Market \u201cthe most desirable neighborhood in Chicago right now,\u201d a claim that lenders and equity partners appear to be warming up to.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Unit 28B spans 2,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nThe apartment was one of 44 of the building\u2019s 62 units to find buyers since sales launched last October. Amenities in the tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern, include a garage, fitness center, pool and porte-cochere.\nA team with Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, led by Alexa Lambert, is heading sales at the Lenox Hill property.\nOf the 11 properties, seven were condos, three were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $70 million, for an average price of $6.4 million and a median of $5.4 million. The typical home spent nearly 250 days on the market and was discounted 4 percent from the original listing price.\n",

The California Street building, rising four stories with 89 units, is reportedly listed for sale at $13 million, or $146,000 per unit.\nIt\u2019s the latest series of loan defaults for San Francisco-based Mosser Companies. Early last year, the firm defaulted on a 2018 loan for $88 million tied to 12 buildings and 459 apartments. A joint venture between The Swig Company and Mosser also defaulted on a $68 million loan tied to five apartment buildings in San Francisco.\n\nLast year, Mosser Companies exited its Financial District headquarters at 220 Montgomery Street after being\nserved an eviction notice\nby landlord Swig. After that, it\nlisted five apartment properties with 173 units\nin Oakland. In 2021, Mosser was sued by tenants in Oakland alleging illegal utility fees and shutoffs and called the landlord a \u201cserial evictor,\u201d the outlet said.\nThe Mosser Companies affiliates have at least 90 days to take care of the default before the lender could serve the firm a notice of potential foreclosure auction. The borrowers could reach a mutual agreement with the lender, including selling the properties to recoup some of the debt.\nMosser owns and operates at least 40 apartment buildings in San Francisco and other properties in Oakland and Los Angeles as of last year. Earlier this summer, a Mosser affiliate\nsold another Nob Hill apartment building\nat 1060 Bush Street for $16.5 million after defaulting on its JPMorgan-issued loan linked to the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nathan Berman is cooking up his next office-to-residential conversion, taking his prodigious spirit to Third Avenue.\nMetro Loft Management filed plans with the Department of Buildings for a residential project at 675 Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. It\u2019s a significant sign of progress coming less than six months after Metro Loft\u2019s partner in the project, David Werner Real Estate Investments, acquired the site from the Durst Organization for $100 million.\nThe conversion plans call for a 464-unit building \u2014 more expansive than previous reports of roughly 430 units \u2014 spanning 321,000 square feet, including retail space on the ground floor. The property would be slightly taller than the office building that stood on the site, leaping from 31 to 35 stories.\nDemolition work is underway at the site, but Metro Loft has not provided a concrete timeline on the project. Werner could not be reached for comment by the outlet.\nThe DOB filing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\n\nIn April, Ron Eliasaf\u2019s Northwind Group handed Werner\na $90 million loan\nfor the acquisition and predevelopment of 675 Third. The 340,000-square-foot office building was roughly two-thirds occupied at the time of sale.\nBerman\u2019s firm is one of the conversion kings of Manhattan and Werner is a frequent ally in his projects. The two are partners at 235 East 42nd Street, where they are redeveloping the former Pfizer headquarters into 1,500 rental units, representing the largest office-to-residential conversion in New York City.\nThe project ran into a brief stumble last month when\nsmoke\nbillowed out of the construction site, briefly sidelining workers. Metro Loft said there was no actual fire, but the New York Fire Department did respond to the scene.\nConstruction is expected to wrap the last quarter of 2027. The property, which will feature a mix of luxury rentals and affordable housing through the 467m tax abatement program, will include more than 100,000 square feet of amenities and 30,000 square feet of retail space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Blackstone\u2019s purchase price for the 352-key East Miami hotel in Brickell is revealed as $147.8 million.\nFunds affiliated with New York-based Blackstone bought the 40-story hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza from funds managed by Honolulu, Hawaii-based Trinity Investments and New York-based Certares, the sellers announced in a news release last week, declining to disclose the price. The sale\nclosed\nlast week and deeds became public on Friday.\nThe deal breaks down to $419,886 per key.\nEast Miami is within the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex that Miami-based Swire Properties completed in 2016. The complex, which spans about five city blocks, also has about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; and a pair of office buildings.\nEast Miami is home to rooftop venue Sugar and has 89 serviced apartments.\nTrinity and Certares bought the hotel from Swire in 2021 for $174 million. The price recorded in the deed for that deal was $120.3 million. Deeds generally reflect the price of the real estate and exclude furniture and fixtures, which usually are purchased with hotels.\nThe true price of the most recent East Miami sale also could be more than the $147.8 million recorded in the deed if furniture and fixtures were to be included.\n\nBlackstone, an alternative asset management giant led by CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, had about $1.2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, according to its website.\nIt\u2019s been active in South Florida recently. This summer, Blackstone and its industrial arm, Link Logistics, sold a 43.7-acre development site for offices and warehouses at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road in Opa-locka for\n$105.7 million\n. The deal brought the sellers\u2019 South Florida sales since November to more than $1 billion.\nBlackstone paid\n$115.9 million\nfor the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes in April, and also provided a\n$300 million\nloan in May for Karim Alibhai\u2019s Gencom and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group\u2019s renovation of the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne at 455 Grand Bay Drive, and planned renovation of the Grand Bay Club at 425 Grand Bay Drive in Key Biscayne.\nBrickell\nemerged as the epicenter of South Florida\u2019s real estate boom, attracting many new-to-market firms expanding to the tri-county region as well as condo developments.\nThe East Miami trade marks the latest sale of a portion of\nBrickell City Centre\n.\nIn June, Swire sold its 75 percent stake in the retail and parking portion at the complex to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n. After canceling a planned office supertall on a 2.8-acre Brickell City Centre development site, Swire sold the property to Melo Group for\n$200 million\nin May.\nAlso, Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International paid\n$45 million\nfor a nearly 1-acre development site at 9 Southeast Sixth Street at Brickell City Centre last month. The site is proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys. Kerzner hasn\u2019t revealed its planned project.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is turning to the courts to secure a key piece of land for its $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nCity attorneys filed a condemnation lawsuit this week against Charter DMN Holdings, a firm controlled by developer\nRay Washburne\n, after failed negotiations over a 36,000-square-foot parcel near Young and Houston streets, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The site sits next to the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street, which the city purchased from Washburne\nearlier\nthis summer for $45.1 million.\nWashburne told the outlet that he\u2019s willing to sell but\nnoted\nthat a long-term ground lease with broadcaster WFAA complicates matters.\nThe disputed lot is a smaller, adjacent parcel, now a parking lot between the newspaper\u2019s former garage and WFAA\u2019s studio. The city council previously authorized up to $6.5 million to purchase it. That April resolution also cleared the way for eminent domain if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached, laying the groundwork for this week\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe city\u2019s $3 billion convention center overhaul, slated to open in 2029, requires more land to accommodate the Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s planned widening of Interstate 30, rail line upgrades and design changes to avoid building over active tracks. Officials last year identified the Dallas Morning News property as essential to fitting the project into downtown\u2019s tight footprint.\nThe city often uses eminent domain for small parcels that don\u2019t make headlines, such as for easements, but it\u2019s less common in high-profile cases.\nWashburne\n, who bought the campus for $28 million in 2019, retained the site\u2019s frontage even after selling the main tract to the city. Earlier this year, he publicly\nfloated\na sale to a data firm, citing frustrations with delays in the city\u2019s planning and prompting the city\u2019s $45.1 million purchase of the property. The city took control of it in June.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The previous week saw\n15 contracts\n\u201410 condos and five houses \u2014 with a total asking volume of $41 million.\u00a0 During the same week last year, just nine luxury contracts were signed in the borough for $27 million.\nThe top contract last week went to Unit 4F at 1 Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights..\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom unit spans 3,200 square feet and came on the market in March, asking $5.75 million, before dropping the price. The seller bought the unit for $2.5 million in 2009, according to public records.\nThe 34-foot-wide great room opens up onto a balcony overlooking Prospect Park. The primary suite features a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom with a soaking spa tub, marble-tiled shower and radiant heated flooring.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Karen Heyman and Alan Heyman had the listing.

        "content": "Kilroy Realty Corporation is\nopening up its options\nto kick off its stalled redevelopment of the San Francisco Flower Market site.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed an application with the city of San Francisco to tweak its design for its mixed-use project at Sixth and Brannan Streets in Central South of Market, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe firm was approved in 2019 to construct office buildings at the site spanning 2 million square feet. In its new application, Kilroy floated several new variants of its approved plan, all of which remove a 22,000-square-foot child care facility and about 1,000 square feet of community space that were part of the original project. The amount of parking on site and the height of the proposed buildings, however, have increased.\nIn one version of the modified project, Kilroy proposed constructing five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. In this iteration, the buildings would range from 11 to 18 stories tall.\nAnother version of the project would utilize the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes; each structure would rise a maximum height of 500 feet, or up to 49 stories. That version would also include 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\n\nAnother version, the \u201cMixed-Use Variant,\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces. They would be housed across five buildings reaching as high as 480 feet, or 47 stories.\nThe \u201cInstitutional Variant,\u201d meanwhile, proposes building roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings that would top out at a maximum of 270 feet, or 18 stories.\nThe city of San Francisco faces a\nstubborn office vacancy rate\nand desperate need for housing.\nThe old San Francisco Flower Market has since\nrelocated\nto a 125,000 square feet at 901 16th Street in Potrero Hill and opened to customers earlier this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal for the nine-story, 41,000-square-foot building breaks down to $1,207 per square foot.\nThe property features 21 loft-style residences, as well as 4,000 square feet of retail space. The retail tenant roster includes an outpost of the popular Van Leeuwen Ice Cream chain.\nGlosslab, a membership-based manicure and pedicure company, was once a retail tenant at the property. But ownership sued Glosslab for more than $100,000 in unpaid rent and evicted it from the building in July 2024, according to court records.\nJLL represented both sides of the sale transaction.\nAcadia and Winnhaven Group acquired the property in 2012 for $32.5 million. Acadia had a 24.5 percent stake in the joint venture, according to an annual report from last year.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Acadia\nfiled an offering plan\nfor a condominium conversion of the property, once known as the Empire State Building. The plan called for a $135.5 million sellout, an average of about $6.5 million per unit.\nElsewhere in the city, Acadia has been on a buying tear, snapping retail properties in Soho and Williamsburg. Since last fall, the real estate investment has acquired more than $280 million in New York City property alone.\nBased in Munich, Pamera opened its first office stateside a little less than a year ago, planning to target properties in the Big Apple, Boston and the Sun Belt, according to PERE News.\nSince then, the firm has launched its efforts with a $30 million acquisition of a luxury residential property on Crosby Street, as well as deals on the Upper East Side, Denver and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The home entered contract in August with an\nasking price of $14.5 million\n.\nThe home originally hit the market asking $18 million in May 2024 with Brown Harris Stevens.\nThe sellers, Jeanne and Dennis Masel, bought the five-story home for nearly $6 million in 2017 and undertook a four-year renovation with Leroy Street Studio beginning in 2018.\nThe Masels cut the price at the start of this year to $17 million before re-listing it with Compass\u2019 Tim Malone at $16.5 million in April and dropping the price again to $14.5 million at the end of May.\n\nThe sale takes the crown from 53 Prospect Park West, a townhouse around the corner from the Masels\u2019 former home that initially sought $30 million when it hit the market in 2021. Poly Prep Country Day School\nbought the home for $13.5\nfrom the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture in 2024 in an off-market deal.\nSingle- and multi-family homes have been some of Brooklyn\u2019s most popular offerings for the past several years. In the second quarter, the borough saw its average price per square foot for 1-3 family homes increase almost 11 percent to $829 from last year, according to a market report from Miller Samuel.\nIn Park Slope in particular, while the number of sales in the first half of 2025 decreased 20 percent, the average price per square foot increased 2 percent year-over-year and homes on average sold for over their asking price, according to a townhouse report from Leslie Garfield.\nThe Massels\u2019 townhouse, which sits less than a block from Prospect Park, has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The garden level features a sunken den with a gas fireplace, an open kitchen with an 18-foot marble island and direct garden access. A second gas fireplace is in the parlor-level living room, and an open library with glass walls looks out to the backyard.\nThe third-floor primary suite has a walk-in dressing room, private terrace and en-suite bathroom.

        "content": "Hot on the heels of California\u2019s CEQA overhaul, state lawmakers are clearing the way for even more housing construction.\nSenate Bill 79, the landmark housing proposal that overrides local zoning laws to increase high-density housing near transit hubs, passed in the state legislature hours before the 2025 legislative session concluded, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe bill, introduced by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener, allows for the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the new zoning rules.\nThe zoning height limits are tier-based according to the type of transit offered at each hub. Tier 1 zoning includes heavy rail lines such as the L.A. Metro\u2019s B and D subway lines and permits buildings from six to nine stories, depending on proximity to the stations. Tier 2 zoning includes bus routes with dedicated lanes and light rail lines such as Los Angeles\u2019 A, C, E and K lines with the possibility of building between five and eight stories.\n\u201cOver the last five years, housing affordability and homelessness have consistently been among the top priorities in California. The smartest place to build new housing is within existing communities, near the state\u2019s major transit investments that connect people to jobs, schools and essential services,\u201d state Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva said in support of the bill.\n\nThe state is rushing to meet a housing crisis that has gripped the Golden State for years.\nIn July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, which increase environmental review exemptions for infill housing, removing hurdles for developers. AB 130 exempts housing-rich infill developments smaller than 20 acres or builder\u2019s remedy projects under 5 acres from CEQA analysis, while Senate Bill 131 protects any rezoning required by a municipality\u2019s Housing Element from CEQA analysis.\nSB 79 faced pushback from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to oppose the bill last month. Bill co-author Traci Park called it a \u201cone-size-fits-all mandate from Sacramento.\u201d The resolution called for L.A. to be exempt from the state-mandated upzoning as it already has a state-approved housing plan. Mayor Karen Bass joined the chorus of local officials opposing SB 79.\nThe bill heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month. California overall must plan to build more than 2.5 million new homes by the turn of the next decade,\naccording\nto its Statewide Housing Plan.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The package includes a $62.4 million senior construction loan from Derby Lane Partners, an $11 million loan from Hoyne Savings Bank and more than $17 million in state and federal historic preservation tax credits, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe redevelopment is slated to be delivered next spring, according to the project\u2019s website. It joins several\nother\noffice-to-residential conversions in the Loop, including city-backed efforts along LaSalle Street, as landlords face high office vacancies.\nBuilt in 1928 as the Millinery Mart Building, the brick and limestone tower later housed Esquire magazine for the publication\u2019s first couple of decades and is home to Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse, which will stay on the ground floor.\nThe building\nchanged\nhands several times in recent years: Rochester-based Intersection Realty bought it from an Acres venture in 2022, then gave it back through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure last year. Acres then\nteamed\nwith Mavrek to pursue the conversion, winning Chicago City Council approval last December.\n\nWith\npermits now in hand\n, the development team can begin to start interior work. The finished product will feature 105 studios, 105 one-bedrooms and 42 two-bedrooms with in-unit workspaces, plus amenities like a co-working lounge, gym and rooftop terrace. According to Mavrek\u2019s website, the third floor will house most of the amenities. Fifty-one units \u2014 about 20 percent \u2014 will be affordable, priced at an average of 60 percent of the area median income. There will be no on-site parking. The project was designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners.\nThe timing comes as downtown\u2019s construction pipeline is all but frozen, with little relief expected until 2027. That scarcity has bolstered landlords\u2019 leverage, pushing median Class A net rents up 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The barren San Francisco mall handed back to lenders by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties is still a bottomless pit of distress, now valued at less than $200 million \u2014 a discount of more than 80% compared to its pre-pandemic peak.\nThe former Westfield San Francisco Centre, which was rebranded as San Francisco Centre after its prior owners bailed, is now worth $195 million, according to Morningstar Credit. It was appraised at $1.2 billion in 2016.\nThe 1.5 million square foot mall at 865 Market Street is two, nine-story buildings that connect. It is the city\u2019s largest shopping mall, and is now only 7 percent occupied after\nretailers\nsuch as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Zara, Steve Madden and Kate Space\nmade exits\n. Bloomingdale\u2019s was its last anchor tenant, occupying 340,000 square feet of space, and it closed shop earlier this year even though the company\u2019s lease wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2046, per Morningstar data.\n\nUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties stopped making payments on a $558 million note a couple years ago; total exposure is $626 million now. The latest servicer commentary notes that the lender is in negotiations with the ground lessor over a ground lease default \u2014 and that the lender intends to foreclose as soon as possible.\n\u201cUpon foreclosure, Lender will immediately market for disposition,\u201d the special servicer commentary, via Morningstar, reads.\nA notice of trustee\u2019s sale was recorded in October last year.\nThe mall\u2019s\nforeclosure auction\nhas been delayed several times but now appears to be an \u201cimminent outcome,\u201d according to Morningstar. The property\u2019s operating losses are continuing at about $4.6 million for the first six months of the year. The mall made about $57 million when its current loan was underwritten in 2016.\n",

        "content": "Adam Hochfelder is facing a new issue in New York, this time courtesy of the state tax department.\nThe former Nassau County developer was named New York\u2019s top delinquent taxpayer with more than $48 million in unpaid personal income taxes, according to\nNewsday\n.\nThe onetime \u201cWharton Whiz Kid,\u201d who once controlled a slice of Manhattan\u2019s skyline, holds the dubious distinction of leading the state\u2019s \u201cTop 100\u201d list of individual tax scofflaws.\nThe ranking, published periodically by the state Department of Taxation and Finance, highlights taxpayers with active warrants, the legal lever that allows authorities to seize property, withhold income and block big-ticket purchases, including real estate.\nIn a statement from Hochfelder\u2019s counsel to\nThe Real Deal\n, his lawyers disputed the underlying taxes allegedly owed to the state, claiming former partner Anthony Westreich issued him an improper K-1 tied to the sale of 1440 Broadway more than a decade ago.\n\u201cIn 2013 when 1440 Broadway was sold, Mr. Westreich issued an erroneous K-1 to Mr. Hochfelder improperly allocating $50 million in profits to Hochfelder, nine years after Hochfelder had sold his interest in 1440 Broadway to Westreich in 2004,\u201d the statement read. Hochfelder, per his lawyer, was only a 1 percent partner in the property after he sold his interest.\n\u201cHochfelder\u2019s counsel has been working with NY State to get Hochfelder\u2019s 2013 tax allocation corrected.\u201d\n\nHochfelder\u2019s tax woes are the latest entry in a career defined by difficulties.\nHe was convicted in 2008 of duping family and friends into lending him $17 million, supposedly for resort investments and later served two years in prison after stealing another $2.5 million. In 2019, he\npleaded guilty again\nto a misdemeanor charge stemming from the older fraud case.\nHe\u2019s far from alone on the delinquent roll call. More than 20 Long Island taxpayers cracked the top 100 this summer; Nassau residents owed a combined $68 million.\nAmong them: restaurateur Zvi Yosef, who owes nearly $3 million tied to his shuttered kosher barbecue spot Chimichurri, and George and Tassos Strifas, operators of East Meadow\u2019s Colony Diner, who also owe close to $3 million in sales tax and previously settled wage theft and harassment claims.\nState officials frame the list as both a warning and an equalizer.\n\u201cThis list is about transparency and fairness,\u201d a Tax Department spokesman told Newsday, arguing that enforcement protects compliant taxpayers from being undercut by those who flout obligations. Still, the agency acknowledges the overall sums are small compared with Albany\u2019s multibillion-dollar budget.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Neither of the workers has been identified.\nSouth Florida construction sites have hardly been devoid of accidents in recent years.\nLast month, a worker died from his\n\u201ctraumatic\u201d injuries\nat a construction site at Bal Harbour Shops. When rescue crews responded to the site, they removed the patient from a \u201cconfined space\u201d on the second floor of the construction site and airlifted him to Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. The man died later that day.\nWhitman Family Development, owner of Bal Harbour Shops in Bal Harbour, is working on a 250,000-square-foot expansion of the 500,000-square-foot luxury shopping center.\nLast year, a construction worker\ndied\nand three others were injured after a portion of a tower crane collapsed at a downtown Fort Lauderdale site where Gables Residential was developing the 43-story Gables Riverwalk apartment tower. The site is at 333 North New River Drive East.\nAlso last year, three workers were\ninjured\nat Fort Partners\u2019 11-story Seaway at the Surf Club condo development site.

        "content": "A Lake Geneva mansion is about to hit the market asking $8.5 million in the luxury resort town where demand is hot and listings rarely go public.\nThe 7,500 square-foot house at 837 Bayview Drive in Lake Geneva is the third notable home in the last month on the lake to be marketed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d before hitting the public market. Houses of that value rarely hit the public market at all in Lake Geneva, where sellers often opt for exclusivity and sell their multimillion-dollar mansions among private brokers.\nTwo lakefront mansions\nlisted by Compass\u2019s Bob Webster\n\u2014 at $8.7 million and $9.8 million \u2014 got contingent offers just three days after hitting the market in early September following a short period listed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nGina Nocek, an @properties broker who is representing the sellers at 837 Bayview Drive, said Webster\u2019s success motivated her clients to use the same marketing strategy and use a delayed listing in the Milwaukee-area\u2019s METRO MLS. The listing alerts other brokers that the house is about to hit the market, and it shows up on some listing services before officially going public.\nNocek said she and her clients think they can fetch a higher price by getting more eyes on the property rather than pursuing a pocket listing. The asking price is $1,135 per square foot.\n\u201cWe felt that we have a better chance of actually driving up the price rather than selling internally,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of Realtors do that, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a benefit to the sellers. Why not put it on the market and get more exposure?\u201d\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom house was built in 2018, Nocek said. It sits on a half-acre lot on the Northeast end of Geneva Lake and has two canopied piers.\nThe listing will go public on Sept. 19, Nocek said, and showings will begin Sept. 20.\n\nNocek declined to identify the property\u2019s sellers, but she said they are relocating to Florida. Property tax bills are addressed to a trust under the name Peggy Roth.\nThe string of properties using \u201ccoming soon\u201d listings is unique for Geneva Lake,\nwhere private listings\nand\noff-market sales\nare common. Of the handful of lakefront homes that sold this year for more than $5 million, just one was listed on the public market, according to listing services.\nReal Estate prices on Geneva Lake have been growing in the last few years as inventory has shrunk and demand for second homes has risen. Homeowners are reluctant to sell their valuable lakefront property, so competition can be fierce when listings go public.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, I used to see 25 lakefront listings. Now we\u2019re lucky if we see five a year,\u201d Nocek said. \u201cI think since COVID, people are not selling them as much as they used to. And that\u2019s what\u2019s creating the increase in price.\u201d\nWebster, who listed two lakefront properties in August using delayed listings, said the process went well for his sellers. Both properties had several showings booked in the first two days of going public, and they got contingent offers within three days. Webster said the properties are under contract and expected to close in mid-October.\nWebster described the delayed public listing as an alternative to office exclusive listings, which Compass has been pursuing with its three-phased marketing approach that begins with an internal private exclusive listing. The delayed public listings can give sellers a broader reach than private listings, while giving the property time to generate interest before hitting the market, Webster said.\n\u201cWe were very successful in getting what I think was the best price and terms for the seller we could, and also at the same time giving all the real estate agents in the realtor community a fair shot at showing it and selling it if they had a prospective buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think it was a win-win all the way around.\u201d\n",

        "content": "St. Charles is preparing to bring order \u2014 and revenue \u2014 to its Wild West short-term rental market.\nCity officials this week outlined a plan to regulate and tax Airbnbs, Vrbos and other short-term rentals, which currently operate without oversight or city revenue collection, in the suburb roughly 45 miles west of downtown Chicago, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The move follows growing concern about the impact of rentals on neighbors and the lack of enforcement tools.\nMayor Clint Hull said any standards must be enforceable, with clear authority to revoke or deny registrations if operators fail to comply.\nCommunity Development Director Russel Colby pitched a registration program run through the city\u2019s website, requiring hosts to disclose property details, ownership information and manager contacts. Operators would also agree to abide by occupancy limits, parking rules ans noise and trash regulations. Violators could face suspension, revocation or denial of renewal.\nWhile staff have not\u00a0 proposed a registration fee, fines would be levied against unregistered hosts, escalating with repeat offenses. The city also plans to tap AirDNA, a third-party analytics firm, to track operators and calculate expected tax revenue.\n\nCity staff estimate more than $70,000 in tax revenue went uncollected last year. Under the proposal, short-term rentals would be subject to the same hotel tax as local lodging operators: 6 percent of 94 percent of gross rental revenue. Currently, the tax is self-reported and largely unenforced, leaving the city blind to the scope of the market.\nOfficials said they identified 47 active short-term rentals in St. Charles, with 44 listed on Airbnb and the rest on Vrbo. With demand for alternative accommodations still strong post-pandemic, more properties could surface once the city builds a formal tracking system. Enforcement measures and bans have been\nconsidered\nin\nlocales\nacross the country since short-term rentals\u2019 pandemic\nboom\n.\nElsewhere in the Chicago area lawmakers have addressed issues with short-term rentals. Highland Park\nblocked\na timeshare plan for \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of Michael Jordan\u2019s former estate, and Chicago aldermen squabbled over whether to\nlower\nthe threshold of ward-wide bans on short-term rentals if enough residents sign a petition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Paramount Group CEO Albert Behler\u2019s past business deals with a Paramount board member adds to the growing number of questions about the office landlord\u2019s decision-making and the independence of its board.\nBehler provided loans and invested in a failed company led by Mark Patterson, a member of the REIT\u2019s board of directors, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings reviewed by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe revelation comes as Paramount and its embattled CEO continue to\nmake headlines\nover shareholder and corporate governance concerns.\nEarlier this year, Paramount said it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to Behler\u2019s companies. In July, Paramount\ndisclosed it was\nunder a SEC investigation. And\nThe Real Deal\nrecently discovered that Behler personally pushed for a no-bid contract to a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager.\nNow,\nTRD\nfound that Behler \u2014 who currently serves as chairman of the board \u2014 had extensive past business dealings with Mark Patterson, an independent board member who once chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee.\nTRD\nalso found that Patterson faced similar allegations about his objectivity and independence while serving on another board.\nAbout a decade ago, Behler agreed to provide at least two loans to Boomerang Systems, a robotic garage company led by Patterson, as it neared bankruptcy. It is unclear whether the debt was ultimately paid back based on a review of bankruptcy and SEC filings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good look, whether in fact he\u2019s compromised or not; the optics are bad,\u201d said Charles Elson, the founding director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\nParamount declined to comment. Patterson did not return a request to comment.\nIndependent board of directors are supposed to provide an added level of objective oversight for publicly traded companies. But the company\u2019s disclosures around millions of dollars heading to Behler\u2019s personal business, along with his high compensation relative to the stock\u2019s performance, raise questions about whether the board is acting in shareholder\u2019s interest or Behler\u2019s.\nThis comes at a critical time. Paramount is in the midst of\nselling the company\nas its stock hovers around $7 per share.\nBoomerang\u2019s bankruptcy and Patterson\u2019s undisclosed ties\nParamount and Behler\u2019s ties to Patterson go back years.\nPatterson, who was formerly a managing director of Merrill Lynch, became the\nCEO\nof Boomerang Systems in 2010. The company built a new technology that essentially created an automatic valet system where parked cars would slide to drivers on concrete slabs, no human operators needed.\nIn 2012, Boomerang\nannounced\nthat Paramount would use Boomerang\u2019s technology for a 256-space garage in an unnamed multifamily project on the West Coast. At that time, Boomerang\u2019s system was only installed in three properties, and Paramount\u2019s project would have been by far its largest.\n\u201cHaving an accomplished and experienced real estate firm like Paramount Group select Boomerang provides great affirmation of our value proposition of enhancing developer\u2019s margins,\u201d said Patterson in a release at the time.\nBoomerang said its robotic car garage would expedite the construction timeline and improve the \u201ceconomics of the project.\u201d But Boomerang ran into one disaster after the next across its projects. In Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, a condo project using Boomerang left residents waiting hours to get their cars.\nBehler was a major investor in Boomerang, according to SEC filings, and participated in offerings for convertible notes, a type of debt that can be converted into equity such as stock.\nBehler also contributed to efforts to keep the company afloat. By late 2014, Behler joined other investors and committed up to $400,000 as an \u201caffiliate\u201d lender. Behler ultimately loaned the $400,000 and controlled over 5 percent of the common stock of Boomerang, owning over 1 million shares, according to an SEC filing as of June 2015.\nBut Boomerang filed for bankruptcy in August 2015 and Patterson, also a major stockholder in the company, stepped down as CEO.\nIn 2016, a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the company\u2019s assets to an existing lender for $2.5 million. Equity holders in the company were wiped out through bankruptcy. (The case officially closed in 2020.)\nBehler was not listed as a creditor in Boomerang\u2019s bankruptcy petition and it is unclear whether his loans were ever repaid.\n\nIn May 2018, Patterson joined Paramount\u2019s board.\nPatterson chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee. He also served as the lead independent director, a role where Patterson acted as a liaison between Behler, the chairman of Paramount\u2019s board, and the other independent board members.\nParamount never disclosed Behler\u2019s past ties to Boomerang in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or its proxy statement.\nStock exchanges set the rules for independent directors, but corporate governance experts say it\u2019s not unusual for board members and CEOs to have friendly relationships.\nAnn Lipton, a business law professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s law school, described the standards for independence as \u201cvery loose.\u201d\nBut Behler\u2019s investment and possible debt to Patterson\u2018s former company raise questions about Paramount\u2019s motivation for keeping Patterson on the board.\nIn 2021, Patterson was voted off the board by shareholders in an uncontested election, with 56 percent of shareholder votes going against Patterson. (Paramount said the vote was a result of Patterson\u2019s role as lead independent board member and not because of his qualifications.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon for shareholders to reject a director that way,\u201d said Michael Levin, founder of consulting firm the Activist Investor.\nParamount ultimately overruled the shareholders and kept Patterson on the board, Crain\u2019s reported. Paramount told shareholders it believed Patterson is a \u201cvaluable contributor\u201d with a \u201ctremendous skillset\u201d, according to an SEC filing.\nPatterson remains on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, serving on the corporate governance committee.\nThe ends justify the means\nPatterson\u2019s board participation \u2014 and prior relationships \u2014\u00a0have raised concerns elsewhere.\nPatterson serves on the board of Digital Realty, a data center REIT, where fellow Paramount board member, Greg Wright, is the chief investment officer.\nThe former chairman of Digital Realty, Laurence Chapman, took issue with Patterson and Wright\u2019s relationship. In 2023, Chapman resigned from Digital Realty\u2019s board and cited a number of alleged corporate governance issues by the board and Patterson in his resignation letter.\nIn addition to serving on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, Wright used to work for Patterson and the two are personal friends, Chapman claimed.\nChapman said these relationships had the \u201cpotential to impact real or perceived objectivity and independence\u201d of the board.\n(Digital Realty said in an SEC filing that the company \u201cwishes to emphasize that the written notification of resignation reflects the thoughts and beliefs of Mr. Chapman only.\u201d)\nChapman also alleged that Patterson personally contacted other company directors at Digital Realty to lobby for executive changes, claiming such maneuvers were improper for someone in his board member position.\n\u201cWhen I tried to discuss my concerns about his approach, Mark told me that in his view, \u2018The end justifies the means.\u2019 That principle originated in Machiavelli\u2019s \u2018The Prince,\u2019\u201d wrote Chapman in the letter.\nWhen it comes to the traits of good governance, Chapman went on, \u201cMachiavelli\u2019s principles seem to be the polar opposite.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A deal for a waterfront mansion in Malba, Queens, just set a new neighborhood record.\nA home at 117 Malba Drive closed for $6.3 million in August, making the priciest sale to hit the books in the wealthy enclave, known for its sprawling suburban-like abodes, according to public records. It last traded for $5.5 million in 2017, which held the previous record.\nThe Mediterranean-style estate hit the market last April with an asking price of nearly $8 million, according to Zillow. It snagged a signed contract in July after multiple price cuts brought its ask down to just under $7 million. The identities of both the buyer and seller were shielded by an LLC.\nThe property spans 8,300 square feet and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a finished basement. It also features a backyard and multiple terraces. The deal includes a deeded boat dock in the neighborhood\u2019s private marina.\nPo Wei Tair of Remax 1st Choice in Great Neck, and Hui Fang Chen of Flushing-based AAA Young Shuen Realty had the listing.\n\nNews of the deal comes as prices have been rising in the luxury section of Whitestone, Queens. In the first quarter of 2025, Malba ranked as the 11th most expensive neighborhood in New York City with a median sale price of $1.6 million, falling just behind the Theatre District in Manhattan, according to a report from\nProperty Shark\n.\nSellers in the neighborhood have been trying to push prices to new heights for several years, though deals continue to fall short of their aspirations.\nAnother waterfront mansion at 3 Point Crescent hit the market in 2017 with an asking price of $9.2 million, at the time the most expensive asking price in Queens. However, the seven-bedroom home didn\u2019t land a buyer until five years later, when it finally sold for just $4 million. It\u2019s now under contract with a last asking price of $5.9 million.\nDespite its climbing prices, the top trades in the borough have largely occurred in the Rockaways. A beachfront home next to Jacob Riis Park scored Queens\u2019 priciest deal in 2023 when it closed for $8.3 million, followed by another home south of Rockaway Beach Boulevard, which sold for $7.6 million in March.\n",

        "content": "This week will determine the fate of two casino proposals in Manhattan.\nAfter more than two years of trying to sell their visions to the public, Wednesday is either the end of the road or a green light to embark on the final stage of the casino competition for Silverstein Properties and SL Green Realty.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees \u2014 each made up of six members \u2014\u00a0will vote on the proposals put forward by the two teams.\nAt least four members of each CAC must vote yes on the respective proposals for the projects to proceed to the final stage of the casino licensing competition. If approved, the proposals will be considered by the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board, which will ultimately decide which three projects are awarded a license.\nA \u2018no\u2019 vote means the project is out of the running. It also means we get to see what becomes of the project sites sans casino. Silverstein has said its property will remain a \u201cgiant hole in the ground.\u201d SL Green\u2019s site is already an office tower, the long-term financial health of which has been\ncalled into question\nif the real estate investment trust does not secure a license.\nSL Green, which has teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, wants to convert the 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway in Times Square into a $5.4 billion casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nSilverstein, along with Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a vacant site at 41st Street and 11th Avenue. The project would feature a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue. The developer has also committed funding to convert offices in and around Community Board 4 into 2,000 housing units. The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.\nThe CACs\u2019 votes are intended to determine whether a project enjoys public support or not. Of course, it is more complicated than that: CAC members were appointed by elected officials, some of whom have made their opposition to casinos clear. Both of the CACs, as with each of the other teams, held two public hearings on the proposals. You could tally up the speakers at those hearings (and in fact, Silverstein\u2019s team counted 122 speakers who supported its proposal at the last hearing, compared to 39 opposed), but that is a snapshot based on hearing attendance and is no guarantee of how CAC members will vote.\nBoth proposals have their detractors, the Broadway League and residents of Manhattan Plaza among the most vocal against the Times Square and Manhattan West proposals, respectively.\nTo what extent these voices, the CAC members\u2019 pre-existing positions on casinos and the various perks promised by the competitors factor into Wednesday\u2019s vote remains to be seen.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I have a guess for how Wednesday\u2019s casino vote will go, but I want to hear from you. What proposals will make it through the CAC process to the competition\u2019s final round? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fortis Property Group\u2019s Olympia Dumbo appears prominently in Spike Lee\u2019s new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d In addition to several shots of the building\u2019s exterior, a model of the building also has a cameo, and at one point, A$AP Rocky\u2019s character name-drops the building.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new report from State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli finds that New York will see relatively little benefit from the Republicans\u2019 sweeping new spending bill, with the biggest winners limited to seniors and tipped workers,\nThe City\nreports. While provisions like deductions for overtime pay, car loan interest and a higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions exist, most New Yorkers won\u2019t qualify or see significant savings. The findings set the stage for a fierce political battle ahead of the 2026 elections, as Republicans tout the cuts and Democrats highlight reductions to key safety net programs.\n\u2014\u00a0Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s retirement has sparked a crowded Democratic scramble for his Manhattan congressional seat, but Assembly member Micah Lasher has quickly emerged as an early front-runner and is reported to be Nadler\u2019s succession choice, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n. Lasher\u2019s political experience, West Side base and alignment with Nadler\u2019s progressive brand position him strongly. Still, a handful of younger or high-profile candidates may jump in. With no ranked-choice voting in the primary, even a narrow plurality could secure the nomination.\n\u2014\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Zohran Mamdani for mayor in a\nNew York Times\nop-ed, calling him a partner in her priority to make New York more affordable while ensuring public safety and economic growth. Hochul highlighted areas of agreement \u2014 affordability, public safety, combating antisemitism \u2014 but repeatedly distanced herself from Mamdani\u2019s democratic socialist agenda, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$10.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 944 Park Avenue. The Upper East Side condo unit is a 3,300-square-foot consolidation of three units.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18 million\nfor 643-47 Ninth Avenue. The Hell\u2019s Kitchen apartment building is a five-story, multifamily building with an office/commercial component. LNR Partners is the seller and Aetna Realty Financial is the buyer.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29 million for a condo unit at 50 Central Park South. The Central Park condo unit is 6,800 square feet and\nlisted\nby Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 76,363-square-foot, 11-story, mixed-use residential and community facility at 16 Convent Avenue in Manhattan. Architect Nickolas Kazalas is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Back then, they were only offering the 500,000-square-foot office condominium, which they own 50-50.

The year 2023 ended with about 29 million square feet of transactions in Manhattan, a decrease from the previous year.\nNow, 2025 is on track to record more than 40 million square feet worth of Manhattan office leases, which would be the first time the borough has cracked that figure since before the pandemic.\nThe Midtown building at the corner of East 47th Street sits across the street from Extell Development\u2019s 570 Fifth Avenue, where Gary Barnett has reportedly signed the law firm Simpson Thacher to a\n700,000-square-foot office lease\nto kick off the development of his planned 29-story office and retail project.\nMetLife bought 575 Fifth Avenue for $385 million in 2005 and sold a 50 percent stake in the office portion to Beacon for an undisclosed price in 2015.\n",

The property at 643 Ninth Avenue stands five stories tall and has 19 apartments across 15,200 square feet. The other building, at 647 Ninth Avenue, is six stories tall and has four apartments across about 6,700 square feet.

        "content": "Thaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube, a real estate titan of the San Francisco Bay Area and prolific philanthropist, has died at the age of 94.\nTaube died at his home in San Mateo County, according to a statement from Taube Philanthropies.\nBorn in Poland in 1931, Taube immigrated to the United States in 1939 with his parents Zygmunt Taube and Lola Popper Taube just before the Nazi invasion of the country. The family settled in California, with Taube even breaking into Hollywood as a boy with his role as a Polish child in the 1942 wartime film \u201cThe Greenie.\u201d\nTaube went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering and a master\u2019s in industrial management from Stanford University. He spent time in the U.S. Air Force before going on to work for two companies in the\nsemiconductor\nindustry. After his stint in tech, Taube turned his sights elsewhere.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d the Polish philanthropist said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nAt first, he joined forces with Stanford roommate Benjamin Johnson to create The Woodmont Companies. The firm went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nFrom there, he became chairman and CEO of Koracorp Industries, the successor to San Francisco-based apparel company Koret of California. He was in charge of the company from 1973 until 1979 when he negotiated the sale of the company to denim giant Levi Strauss.\nOnce he sold Koret of California, he established the Koret Foundation for charitable causes, leading the organization for the next quarter century.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me then, and has continued to stand out through two decades of watching Tad in action, is the depth of his philanthropic pursuits,\u201d former Secretary of State George P. Shultz once said of Taube. \u201cBeyond his generosity of spirit, Tad actively works to make a difference. He wants to see results.\u201d\nIn his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nIn the Bay Area and across California, Taube funded projects including the revamp of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Besides that, he launched programs for at-risk youth in tandem with Bay Area sports teams such as \u201cHoops for Kids\u201d with the Golden State Warriors, \u201cTouchdowns for Kids\u201d with the San Francisco 49ers and \u201cGoals for Kids\u201d with the San Jose Sharks.\nIn addition to sports, education and museums, Taube invested in health care initiatives like the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health. He helped launch the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative between several universities including Stanford.\nTaube is survived by his wife Dianne, who serves as president of Taube Philanthropies, and their children Mark, Paula, Sean, Juddson, Travis and Zakary.\n\u201cHis impact will shape the world for years to come,\u201d Dianne said.\n",

The seven condos are attached to Bowie House, the Auberge Resorts Collection hotel in\nFort Worth\u2019s Cultural District\n.\nThe 2,700-square-foot home, still under construction, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The other condos range from two to four bedrooms with asking prices between $5.5 million and $6.4 million, according to Douglas Elliman agent Hannah Sullivan, who has the listing.\n\nEntrepreneur and cutting horse champ Jo Ellard is the developer behind Bowie House. After years of traveling to Fort Worth for equestrian events, Ellard recognized the demand for luxury accommodations in Cowtown. The hotel and condos are close to Dickies Arena and the Will Rogers Memorial Center, which host rodeos and horse competitions. The property is also adjacent to the River Crest Country Club.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the only thing like that there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have any competitors.\u201d\nThe condos at Bowie House aren\u2019t just the first of their kind in Fort Worth;\nthey\u2019re among the first in Texas\n. Other branded luxury condo projects in the Texas pipeline include\ntwo Ritz-Carlton residences\n, an Auberge-branded condo development and a St. Regis tower, all in the Houston area, and\nthe Knox in Dallas\n, another Auberge concept.\nAlthough three of the units have already sold, this fourth residence was the first to be listed publicly, according to Sullivan. The rest are also under construction, and the next two are expected to list in October and November.Residential inventory has been steadily piling up in Fort Worth. It\u2019s no longer a seller\u2019s market,\nbut\ninventory is still lower\nthan the average in Dallas and in Texas overall.\n",

Horton, Perry Homes and McGuyer Homebuilders \u2014 each delivered more than 700 houses in federally mapped flood zones across the metro\u2019s five\nlargest\ncounties, Houston Chronicle\nanalysis\nfound. Those builders account for a significant\nshare\nof the 65,000 structures built in floodplains since the storm.\nTexas has no statewide code for\nfloodplain\nconstruction, leaving standards to local governments, which often allow development if homes are elevated and detention ponds are built. That flexibility has fueled suburban expansion but, critics say, ignores mounting climate risks.\nJim Blackburn, an environmental attorney and Rice University professor, told the outlet that developers are likely targeting cheaper, more available land in floodplains as large tracts elsewhere dwindle.\n\u201cWe have generally accepted floodplain development in the past,\u201d Blackburn told the outlet. \u201cI just think it may not be the right way to go forward in the future.\u201d\nMiami\n-based Lennar, through its Friendswood Development arm, has been especially active, with 5,700 homes built since Harvey, 25 percent of them in flood zones. Its projects include Tavola in New Caney, where residents reported major flooding during Tropical Storm Imelda just months after moving in.\n\nMeritage built nearly 3,000 homes \u2014 28 percent of them in floodplains \u2014 including the controversial Spring Brook Village in Spring Branch that drew sharp pushback from flood control advocates and residents that contended the elevated homes would make flooding in adjacent neighborhoods worse. That project ultimately won Houston City Council approval.\nD.R. Horton\nput up 8,100 homes, about 760 of them in high-risk zones, while\nPerry Homes\ndelivered 3,900, nearly 20 percent in mapped floodplains.\nPerry\u2019s Woodridge Village project near the Harris-Montgomery county line triggered lawsuits after nearby homes flooded; the dispute ended with a $14 million land sale to Houston and Harris County for detention basins.\nMcGuyer Homebuilders, now part of Dream Finders Homes, placed nearly a third of its 2,200 post-Harvey builds in flood zones, including portions of Towne Lake in Cypress.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Part of that strategy involves tacking a crack at retail real estate abandoned by other national chain stores.\nBarnes &amp; Noble is gearing up for three store openings across the metro area as part of a nationwide\ngrowth\nstrategy, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The bookseller confirmed upcoming locations in Spring, the Aliana community between Richmond and Sugar Land in Fort Bend County, and on Fry Road in Katy. The additions will bring its Houston-area store count to 15.\nIn Aliana, the company pre-leased an 18,000-square-foot building in the Market Center at 10191 Grand Parkway, according to developer Property Commerce. Construction is set to begin in weeks, with delivery expected in the spring or early summer. The retail center is nearly fully leased, anchored by H-E-B and Target, with the Barnes &amp; Noble site designed by LA Architects and built by U.S. Builders.\nAnother store will open in mid-November at the Target-anchored Grand Parkway Marketplace in Spring, taking over a 12,500-square-foot space formerly occupied by Party City, at 6600 Spring Stuebner Road. Another deal was inked for a nearly 22,000-square-foot former Party City in Katy\u2019s Greentree Shopping Center at 435 South Fry Road, which is slated to debut early next year, Ironbridge Realty confirmed.\n\nThese moves follow a January reopening of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s renovated Town &amp; Country Village store and a July 2024\nopening\nin the Conroe Marketplace in a space vacated by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nThe Houston surge is part of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s broader rebound after years of shrinking. The chain said it\nopened\nmore stores last year alone than in the entire decade between 2009 and 2019, when it\nsold\nto hedge fund Elliott Management for $475 million cash.\nBy the end of this year, it expects to open more than 60 locations nationwide, with a similar pace planned for next year. It also recently struck a $3.25 million deal to acquire Books Inc., a longtime San Francisco Bay Area independent chain.\nThe company\u2019s strategy for success is not just in its retail expansion, but also to keep local bookshops in business. James Daunt, Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s CEO, said last year that over the past couple of decades the company has bought and maintained bankrupt independent regional bookstores.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Veranda Apartments, which was delivered last year, is about 7 miles southeast of downtown, near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and the Tesla factory.\nBow River Capital coined and trademarked the term \u201cRodeo Region,\u201d which refers to the Southwest and Mountain West states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.\n\nThe firm also recently bought two properties in Kansas City, Missouri and the 337-unit Camden Midtown, at 2303 Louisiana Street in Midtown Houston, from Camden Property Trust and rebranded it as\nHadley Midtown Apartments\n.\nInvestors like Bow River Capital are calling bottom for Austin\u2019s multifamily market, which has been wrecked by a historic glut of supply that resulted in big losses for rent rates and occupancy.\nRents slid 7.5 percent\nlast month, compared to a year prior, and occupancy fell to 85 percent, according to ApartmentData.com.\nIn fact, rents have fallen so much that the city\nleads the country in rental affordability\n, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said last month. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nAustin\u2019s tailwinds are promising, though, Pan said. In the last decade, the city has seen 30 percent population growth and 48 percent job growth. Its Sun Belt peers average growth rates of about 25 or 30 percent.\n",

        "content": "Marc Benioff recently said his tech company was able to cut thousands of jobs due to artificial intelligence, but rising demand in the sector is also leading the Salesforce CEO to add space at its Manhattan home.\nThe San Francisco-based company agreed to expand its footprint by 71,000 square feet at 3 Bryant Park, otherwise known as Salesforce Tower, CoStar\nreported\n. The dual expansion and renewal means Salesforce leases a 311,000-square-foot chunk of the 1.2-million-square-foot Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge property at 1095 Sixth Avenue.\nIn a statement, an executive for the tech company said its \u201cvision for real estate is to create the right spaces and experiences that accelerate growth and empower humans, agents and robots to work alongside one another.\u201d\nFinancial details of the lease were not disclosed, but Salesforce\u2019s lease is locked in through May 2029. The additional space will include an employee training center, collaboration and hybrid-work areas, and space for a customer-focused initiative.\nSalesforce\u2019s footprint has been boomeranging back and forth in recent years as the office landscape has changed. Last year, the company said it leased 900,000 square feet in its home city of San Francisco, a 45 percent reduction from the 1.6 million square feet it said it had in the city as of early 2023.\n\nArtificial intelligence is counterintuitively bringing tech companies back to their physical spaces, though. Tech companies\u2019 leasing rose 21 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to CBRE, accounting for about a sixth of total office leasing volume in the country.\nThis year, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\nlanded a $1.13 billion refi\nfor its trophy office tower, receiving a CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal. It paid $2.2 billion in 2015 to buy the Bryant Park tower, the second most-expensive office purchase in U.S. history at the time.\nThe property was 97 percent leased at the time of the refinancing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is slated to be built on land that Marina Annex Housing acquired for $2 million in February, property records show. The seller was the Riviera Beach Housing Authority, which was deeded the land by the city in 2024 for $10 and remains a partner in the venture.\n\u201cThe way we can effectively work as the housing authority is to\u2026 partner with others to bring affordable housing to this community,\u201d said Riviera Beach Housing Authority Executive Director John Hurt.\nThe housing authority will also partner with the Alpha Phi Alpha Foundation to run the community center, which can be used for educational purposes, meeting room space and offices for nonprofits, he added.\n\nA later presentation by Harris of Urban Farmers revealed that the community center would be named after the late Edward Rodgers, the first Black circuit court judge of Palm Beach County.\nSince its founding in 1983, O\u2019Connor Capital Partners has developed $30 billion worth of projects in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Asia, according to the company\u2019s website. Led by CEO Bill O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Connor Capital\npaid $28.8 million for an 86,000-square-foot shopping center in Delray Beach\nin July.\nWorkforce housing developer Urban Farmers was started in 2010 by former Marriott International development manager Terry Booty. In 2019, the Hallandale Beach City Commission approved Urban Farmers\u2019 plan to build the 200-unit\nEighth Avenue Commons\nproject on a parking lot previously owned by the Hallandale Church of God.\nDevelopers are targeting Riviera Beach, as they seek new frontiers to build in Palm Beach County.\nTwo blocks east of Marina Annex\u2019s development site, Boca Raton-based SobelCo proposed a\n1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use project\nwith 508 condos at West 11th Street and Broadway. Between those two development sites the Riviera Beach Community Development Corporation is building Villa L\u2019Onz, a 12-unit workforce townhouse project.\nAnd on the east side of Broadway, Related Urban and the Related Group have secured development sites in the city-owned, 90-acre Marina Village area for\nResidences at Marina Village\n(a 149-unit workforce housing project) and\nGallery at Marina Village\n(a 418-unit market-rate project).\nThe Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency is still entertaining additional development proposals at Marina Village after elected city officials\ndeclared a do-over\nin July after most developers sent incomplete applications for a previous request for qualifications. Anyone interested in building on publicly-owned waterfront land has until Nov. 18 to submit plans and qualifications.Related Urban, the only bidder to submit a completed application in July, will present plans to build a condo-hotel with food and beverage establishments, a Related Urban spokesman previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. Robert Sonnenblick, chairman of Pacific Palisades, California-based Sonnenblick Development, said he wants to build a two-phased project that will include a\n150-room Compass by Margaritaville hotel\n.",

The estate includes 5 acres of\nvineyards\nwhere the Malibu Rocky Oaks wine brand grows 10 grape varietals for red, white and ros\u00e9 offerings.\nMalibu Rocky Oaks was founded in 2003 by Howard Leight Sr. His son Howard Leight Jr. now runs the business. The Leights bought the property in 2005 for $3.5 million, per Realtor.com.\nIn the more than two decades since then, new local laws have prevented the opening of new wineries in the area, making the Rocky Oaks property that much more of a rare purchase. The sale would include the estate\u2019s grapes and irrigation sales, though a new owner wouldn\u2019t get ownership of the Malibu Rocky Oaks brand.\nThe family has been trying to sell the property since 2012 when it first hit the market for $43 million. The property went on and off the market several times after that and was even available for rent. It was\nlast listed in 2022\nfor $49.5 million.\nThe estate\u2019s Tuscan-style main house, built in 2009, sits on a hilltop and comes complete with a stone exterior and red tile roof, both essential in creating a natural fire resistance.\n\nThe 7,665-square-foot manse boasts classic Italian-inspired touches like stone fireplaces, wrought-iron balustrades and beamed ceilings as well as contemporary features like tall ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. It contains five bedrooms and five bathrooms, including a primary suite with its own fireplace and private terrace.\nA rooftop terrace tops off the house, while a deck wraps around much of the exterior. Elsewhere outside, the home has an infinity-edge pool with a hot tub. Reality TV fans might recognize the property from \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and\n\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a one-of-a-kind property in which modern approvals for an estate of this scale and location would be next to impossible,\u201d Chris Cortazzo of Compass, who is helping handle the sale, said in a statement, per Realtor.com.\nThe online auction for the home is now open and ends Oct. 30, barring the seller accepting a bid before the deadline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "At first glance, the\nsale of 346 Madison Avenue\nto SL Green didn\u2019t seem to involve RFR. But Aby Rosen\u2019s firm is seeking damages after allegedly doing significant due diligence on the property, only for that information to apparently facilitate the sale to another party.\nRFR filed a lawsuit Monday in New York County Supreme Court, The Promote\nreported\n. The company is suing the selling ownership entities, led by Luxottica heir and former Brooks Brothers CEO Claudio Del Vecchio, for unspecified damages.\nThe saga dates back to before the pandemic, when Del Vecchio started looking to offload the Brooks Brothers store at 346 Madison alongside an adjacent office building at 11 East 44th Street. They were put up for sale in 2021, according to the suit, via JLL.\nAfter struggling to sell the properties, RFR claims to have come on the scene, conducting extensive due diligence on a site mired by difficult zoning and capitalization issues. It allegedly reached an exclusivity and confidentiality agreement with the seller and shared information from its due diligence.\nThere was even a purchase and sale agreement put in place, according to the lawsuit. But after an exclusivity term expired, the agreement was allegedly \u201cduplicated into the name of another buyer and executed.\u201d RFR didn\u2019t name the buyer, but it likely didn\u2019t have to, as SL Green entered into contract on a $160 million acquisition at the start of this month.\n\nRFR alleges its confidential data was uploaded to a third-party site accessible to competitors, a breach that allowed SL Green to quickly scoop up a deal after RFR\u2019s exclusivity window closed. RFR likened the breach to a \u201cTrojan Horse.\u201d\nJLL listing broker David Giancola allegedly used RFR\u2019s interest in the property to \u201csqueeze out value\u201d from the deal, but Giancola is not listed as a defendant in the case.\nRFR declined to comment on the lawsuit to The Promote. Del Vecchio could not immediately be reached by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the lawsuit may affect SL Green\u2019s plans for a ground-up office development steps away from Grand Central Terminal; the site could house an 800,000-square-foot project. It\u2019s adjacent to 350 Madison Avenue, a 400,000-square-foot property owned by none other than RFR.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The listing works out to $2,230 per square foot.\nThe move comes more than eight months after lender First Foundation Bank accused Cosby of defaulting on a $17.5 million loan tied to the 13,000-square-foot home. The bank claims he stopped making payments on the debt and owes more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nCosby and his wife, Camille, bought the limestone manse in 1990 for $6.3 million. Known as the Luyster Mansion, the residence dates to 1899 and is packed with period flourishes, from mahogany floors to an original elevator that still connects nearly every level.\nThe six-bedroom property boasts a dining room that seats 30, multiple suites, a roof garden and a parlor level for entertaining.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider has the\nlisting\n, which marks the first time the property has hit the market in more than 35 years.\n\nThe 71st Street property isn\u2019t Cosby\u2019s only Manhattan fire drill.\nIn April, he listed another townhouse, a four-story property at 243 East 61st Street once used by his late son Ennis, for $7 million. That asking price was cut to $6.75 million in July. CitiMortgage accused Cosby and his wife of defaulting on a $4.2 million loan tied to that home and is\npursuing foreclosure\n.\nThe foreclosure suits are only the latest legal headaches for Cosby. His sexual assault conviction was overturned in 2021, but he continues to face fresh claims, including one in January accusing the actor of drugging and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in Las Vegas in the 1980s.\nThese days, Bill and Camille primarily live outside Philadelphia, where they paid $225,000 for a suburban estate in the 1980s before \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d elevated the comedian to new heights.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Richard Elias signed the deed on behalf of the seller.

Glaser and his partner are looking to flip the property\nfor $169 million\n, or rent it out for $495,000 a month, but Glaser is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nNext door, billionaire Jamie Salter, the founder, chairman and CEO of Authentic Brands Group, sold his waterfront 0.7-acre property at 5970 North Bay Road in January to brand mogul Anand Khubani\nfor $40 million\n.\nMarcelo Claure, the former CEO of Sprint and SoftBank Group International, is building a waterfront mansion nearby, at 5212 North Bay Road.\n",

That total was already the second-highest ever, behind 2022\u2019s record 136. If momentum holds, 2025 is on track to\nchallenge\nor top that peak.\nMuch of the action is in Winnetka, where @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay has\ndominated\nthe leaderboard, repping one side or both in five of the year\u2019s top six deals. The suburb notched the year\u2019s headline-grabber: a 22-room lakefront estate that went for over $31 million, the highest price ever paid for an existing home in the Chicago area. Radnay told the outlet that Winnetka\u2019s mix of investment value and lifestyle draw buyers fast when properties enter the market.\nChicago itself has notched a\nmajority\nof the high-ticket sales this year. A Gold Coast condo crossed the $10 million mark, and Ken Griffin quietly sold two unfinished Gold Coast floors for a combined $15.9 million \u2014 deals that could end up ranking higher once ownership details are clarified. So far this year, 64 of the 109 luxury sales have been in Chicago.\n\nThe run isn\u2019t just about wealth cushioning buyers from inflation. Radnay said families are betting on long-term appreciation and paying premiums for lakefront security. Carrie McCormick of @properties Christie\u2019s said that scarcity drives urgency.\nThere\u2019s still potential reshuffling ahead, with a pair of pending suburban sales near $15 million in Kenilworth and Lake Forest. Even so, nothing comes close to Winnetka\u2019s record-setter.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market has come a long\nway\nsince the 2010s, when $4M deals averaged around 50 a year. Prices have swelled in the 2020s, with Redfin data showing the metro\u2019s median home price up 73 percent since 2019.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The proverb \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is not my friend\u201d does not apply to the controversy around\nTexas\u2019 House Bill 21\n.\nThe affordable housing reform law meant to close the state\u2019s \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation loophole has been heavily\ncriticized by the same people who advocated for reform\n. But the law\u2019s detractors aren\u2019t all on board with a\nlawsuit challenging HB 21\nthat was filed last week.\nThe lawsuit exacerbated the drama, since one of the entities that brought it is affiliated with Post Investment Group, which has used the traveling housing finance corporations loophole. Meaning the firm got tax credits on apartment complexes by partnering with housing finance corporations in counties other than where the properties are located.\nThis divisive Texas law has politicians and developers squabbling in a climate where real estate often gets what it wants from the legislature, but in this case, real estate is divided.\nIt\u2019s a Venn Diagram with three circles representing Rep. Gary Gates and his HB 21, affordable housing developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole and developers who partook of traveling tax credits.\nThe first two overlap in their opposition to the affordable housing scheme. But the next two overlap in their opposition to HB 21, meaning developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole oppose Gates, his law and the group of developers who used the loophole.\n\u201cThey screwed this up for people doing in-jurisdictional deals,\u201d Waterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman said of developers that used the loophole. But he also opposes HB 21, which he argues is \u201canti-Texas\u201d for undermining local control and the decisions of local housing authorities.\nWaterford belongs in the second circle, and Drachman has been raising the red flag about the loophole for over a year.\nThe lawsuit was brought by Texas Workforce Housing Coalition and an affiliate of Post, the ground lease tenant of a San Antonio apartment complex that is a traveling housing finance corporation deal. It aims to legitimize these cross-juridictional deals, emphasizing that Chapter 394 expressly allows these kinds of deals and claims they were affirmed by governmental bodies, including appraisal districts.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to craft a story of victimhood for both them and their partners and lenders and tenants especially that is just patently false,\u201d Drachman said.\nIn particular, he has a problem with the lawsuit\u2019s claim that HB 21 \u201cwill cause mass evictions of teachers, nurses and first responders.\u201d That\u2019s a lie, he said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t comply, you don\u2019t get property tax exemptions. Then you have to pay your property taxes. I don\u2019t know why that would lead to mass evictions,\u201d he said.\nThe argument behind the lawsuit\u2019s contention is that if developers lose properties due to increased tax bills, new ownership could raise rents.\nDrachman concedes there\u2019s merit to the lawsuit\u2019s argument that HB 21 violates the Texas Constitution by affecting contracts already in place. HB 21 creates new affordability requirements for future housing finance corporations deals and requires that prior deals, including those that used the loophole, come into compliance with the stricter standards.\nHB 21 is the result of a campaign to outlaw traveling housing finance corporations. But the legislation that ended up getting signed was so divisive that it made enemies out of the loudest voices pushing for reform of the program.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Gates, who is a multifamily operator in Houston, has repeatedly called the arguments of his detractors \u201cred herrings,\u201d treating the loophole-using developers and the developers who didn\u2019t use it as the same group.\nGates\u2019 office said he wouldn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n",

New York-based Sculptor Capital Management provided the rest of the financing.\nThe package likely marks the largest condo construction financing in Tampa.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads, led by Taylor Collins and Reid Boren secured the debt for the Pendry Tampa and Pendry Residences\nTampa\n, which will have a 220-key Pendry hotel and a 207-unit condo component. The condo portion is more than 60 percent presold with more than $300 million in presales, according to the release.\nCondo prices range from $1.8 million to $5.8 million, excluding penthouses, according to a spokesperson.\n\nConstruction is underway on the fourth floor of the planned 38-story tower, which fronts the Hillsborough River. Amenities will include waterfront restaurants, more than 10,000 square feet of conference and ballroom space, a 14,000-square-foot spa and a fitness center.\nC-PACE stands for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, which encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. The Pendry project is being built more than 11 feet above sea level. The building\u2019s HVAC system and the design of the structure will save 55,701 lifetime metric tons of carbon, according to a press release from Nuveen. That\u2019s equivalent to the annual energy use of 7,500 homes in the U.S.\nThe project was once slated to become\nTrump Tower Tampa\nunder a different group of developers, the Tampa Bay Times previously reported.\nIn South Florida,\nTwo Roads\nand its partner, Alpha Blue Ventures,\nrecently completed\nFort\u00e9 on Flagler, a 25-story, 40-unit condo project in West Palm Beach. Nearly all the units were presold for a combined $289.1 million at the time the building was completed.\nTwo Roads\u2019 track record in the region is complicated by litigation surrounding its planned Edition Residences condo project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\u00a0In July, the Third District Court of Appeal\nruled in favor\nof a group of eight holdout owners who have been fighting the buyout of their condo building, Biscayne 21, for years. In 2022, Two Roads Development paid\nabout $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront 192-unit building, on the site where it plans to build Edition Residences. The following year, the holdout owners sued over the developer-controlled condo association amending the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. Two Roads has said it plans to take the issue to the Florida Supreme Court.\n",

        "content": "A Hinsdale mansion brought in the highest sale price in the wealthy Chicago suburb in over a year, even after taking a 20 percent cut from its asking price.\nExcluding lakefront North Shore towns, the Elm Street deal in Hinsdale marks the priciest inland suburban home sale so far this year in Chicagoland, aside from a\nBarrington home featured in the hit TV show \u201cEmpire\u201d\nthat sold for $6.5 million. Yet that deal only closed after the home spent a dozen years on the market and originally listed for nearly $16 million.\nThe Hinsdale mansion at 818 South Elm Street, with seven bedrooms and eight-and-a-half bathrooms, sold for $5.9 million on Sept. 11. The 16,000-square-foot home sits on a tree-lined 1.27-acre lot that includes a swimming pool.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s\nDawn McKenna\nand Lauren Walz represented the property\u2019s seller, and Alexandra Shaban of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented the buyer. Both declined to comment on the deal. The house was previously owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity. The buyer is not yet reflected in public property documents.\n\nThe South Elm Street house was initially\nlisted at $7.3 million\nin August 2024, testing the upper end of the market for the high-end western suburb. It came off the public market in December 2024 and was not listed publicly again before selling.\nThe ultimate sale price of $5.9 million makes it the most expensive sale of the year in Hinsdale and among the priciest so far this year in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs. The last Hinsdale sale to surpass the Elm Street home\u2019s price closed in June 2024.\nHinsdale was ranked the 8th wealthiest suburb in the U.S. according to a July GOBankRates analysis,\nThe Real Deal reported\n. It had the highest year-over-year home value growth among the country\u2019s wealthiest suburbs in May 2025, with the total average home value reaching about $1.2 million on an 8 percent year-over-year gain.\nMany of the top western suburban sales this year have been in Hinsdale, including a $4.9 million house on South Park Avenue, a $4.7 million estate on County Line Road and a $4.5 million house on East 6th Street.\nTwo homes have fetched prices above $7 million in Hinsdale: A\n17,600 square-foot mansion\nsold for a record $7.7 million in 2021, and an off-market sale\nbrought in $7.5 million in 2022\n.",

Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments got approval on its planned 203-unit project at 400 Divisadero Street in 2017.\n\u201cThe original approvals were based on the building code standards of 2016,\u201d Mahmood told the Chronicle. \u201cThey have to keep going back and\nchanging the project\n.\u201d\nUnder current regulations, San Francisco\u2019s building code requires projects to adhere to the building code in place when they break ground, rather than when the application was filed. The\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been stalled for nine years, and the building codes change every three. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans.\nIn the years since then, codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy have made projects such as these less feasible, tacking on an additional 5 percent to 7 percent of costs, according to the Chronicle. By using the regulations in place in 2016, the developer would save approximately $4 million on the project.\n\u201cWe wanted to see if we could solve the housing death spiral in which each delay results in other delays, compounding the problem,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nThe project calls for 203 units to be built in six stories on the Touchless Car Wash site, including approximately 20 set aside for affordable housing. Mahmood\u2019s proposed legislation would reduce hurdles to getting shovels into dirt.\n\u201cAt a minimum what it does is gives us a little bit of relief in lower construction costs,\u201d 4Terra partner Amir Massih told the Chronicle. \u201cHaving somebody in City Hall advocating on your behalf is a welcome change from the past.\u201d\nUncertainty still remains a factor as tariffs could threaten to increase already high construction costs and equity partners are wary of investing in housing projects. But if the stars align and Mahmood\u2019s legislation allows the project to stick to its original application plans, groundbreaking on the project could happen next year, Massih told the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The plans from Frontier Group call for a 29-story tower rising approximately 300 feet and replacing a partially vacant two-story building on a narrow lot.\nThe project was first proposed in 2019, when the local lodging market was flourishing, but the pandemic ground that pace practically to a halt.\nChelsea Pacific Group, the owner of the historic seven-story Chancery Building next door to the proposed hotel, fought against the plan.\nChelsea Pacific argued that Frontier Group\u2019s planned hotel would be so close to the Chancery Building\u2019s side windows that it would block sunlight, decrease privacy and make it harder for the firm to find tenants for offices. It also pointed out the effects of noise, dust, air pollution and vibration caused by construction that can damage property. The building\u2019s office space is 96 percent leased \u2014 a notable success with the city\u2019s second-quarter office vacancy rate at 35.7 percent, according to JLL.\n\nChelsea Pacific submitted an economic analysis earlier this summer saying a new hotel isn\u2019t needed and would hurt existing hotels, but Frontier Group\u2019s analysis, completed by CBRE\u2019s hotel advisory group, said the proposed hotel will likely enter a \u201cstrong and viable\u201d market.\nSan Francisco visitor spending fell from $9.6 billion in 2019 to $2.7 billion in 2020, while the number of visitors dropped from 26.2 million to 11.8 million. Tourists have started flocking back, but tourism levels haven\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Tourism is expected to rise over the next year, with 23.5 million visitors projected this year, according to San Francisco Travel Association.\nHotel occupancy is projected to reach 65.2 percent this year and 66.3 percent next year. In the year before the pandemic, the rate was at 82.7 percent.\nHotel properties in San Francisco\nand across the Bay Area have seen better days. Hotel owners have fallen into\nloan default\nor faced\nforeclosure\n, bankruptcy,\ndepressed sale value\nand closure as the market gets back on its feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "H-E-B\u2019s long-awaited arrival inside Dallas city limits isn\u2019t getting the warm welcome the Texas grocer is accustomed to.\nThe San Antonio-based grocery chain is facing opposition over plans for a 127,000-square-foot store on nearly\n10 acres\nalong Interstate 635 at Hillcrest Road, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The company bought the land earlier this year, sparking celebration among shoppers who trek miles to reach the nearest H-E-B. But the site requires a zoning change from low-rise commercial to regional retail, which would allow a building up to 70 feet tall with heavy lot coverage \u2014 a scale that some neighbors say doesn\u2019t fit.\nSupporters argue the store would fill a\ngap\nin North Dallas retail options. Some residents praised H-E-B\u2019s reputation as a civic-minded operator and said traffic concerns were being exaggerated.\nBut homeowner groups are rallying against the project, citing congestion, truck loading zones and design issues. The Hillcrest Forest Neighborhood Association, which has circulated petitions, called the store \u201cout of character\u201d with the area and warned it could dump 6,000 additional cars onto an already busy intersection.\n\nThe pushback is consistent with a \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d streak that has shaped development battles in affluent North Dallas. Similar concerns have derailed or delayed projects like the Pepper Square\nredevelopment\n3 miles north. This latest fight is less about H-E-B itself than the scale of the plan \u2014 most H-E-B stores sit on 20 acres, double the proposed footprint. Some have suggested the grocer relocate to the former Valley View mall site 2 miles away, a sprawling 110-acre property already zoned for retail.\nMabrie Jackson, H-E-B\u2019s public affairs director, said the company has met with neighbors since January and is committed to being \u201ca good neighbor.\u201d The rezoning request heads to the Dallas City Plan Commission this week before reaching Dallas City Council. If approved, construction could still be years out \u2014 with 2028 pegged as the earliest opening date.\nH-E-B\u2019s growing presence since the grocer entered Dallas-Fort Worth in 2022 has driven competitors such as Walmart, Kroger and Tom Thumb to increase their investments in the region. Kroger also\nsignaled\nits own North Texas expansion plans with four new stores announced last month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The bank plans to occupy the four floors for four years as it renovates its headquarters at 240 Greenwich Avenue.\nDiscussions over a possible sublease deal were reported by the Commercial Observer back in May. Further details about the financial arrangement were\nnot disclosed\n.\nJLL represented BNY in the sublease deal, while CBRE\u2019s Scott Gottlieb represented the publisher. Newmark also gave building co-owners The Durst Organization and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey a seat at the table.\nCond\u00e9 Nast will need to figure out a strategy for the space four years down the line, as its lease doesn\u2019t expire until the end of the next decade. Cond\u00e9 leases 1.2 million square feet in the 104-story, 3.1 million-square-foot building, but started subleasing space almost immediately after moving in.\n\nSince 2019, more than 230,000 square feet had been claimed by subtenants before this latest agreement. Last year, financial advisory firm Kroll\nleased 48,000 square feet\nfrom the publisher on a 10-year deal with an asking price of $59 per square foot.\nCond\u00e9 publicly fought with its landlords at one point, withholding $2.4 million in rent after the onset of the pandemic as it attempted to renegotiate its lease. It ultimately paid the amount owed in full.\nIn May, Durst made the 89th and 90th floors\navailable to lease\n, the first time they\u2019re being marketed to office tenants. The landlord is looking to capitalize on the sky-high floors and garner rents in the ballpark of $160 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Factory in Long Island City has landed in special servicing, another sign of distress in New York\u2019s outer-borough office market.\nThe $300 million loan tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot office property at 30-30 47th Avenue was sent to special servicing this month for \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d according to Morningstar Credit. The debt comes due in October after several extensions.\nThe owners, a group led by Midtown-based Atlas Capital Group, were current on their payments through August, according to Morningstar. The loan had not previously been delinquent, but the building\u2019s financials have steadily worsened. Operating expenses have climbed every year since the loan originated in 2020. At the same time, income has eroded.\nOccupancy stood at just over 73 percent as of the second quarter. That\u2019s\ndown from\n83 percent in 2020. The largest tenant, Macy\u2019s marketing department, occupies 146,000 square feet across three floors, according to CoStar data. Other tenants include the New York City School Construction Authority, Tourneau and Polo Ralph Lauren.\nUnder the loan agreement, the borrowers have already exercised three extension options. If they can\u2019t secure new financing, the property could be at risk of default.\n\nOriginally built in 1926 as a Macy\u2019s furniture warehouse, Atlas Capital, Invesco and Square Mile Capital Management acquired the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2013. They invested more than $90 million to redevelop it into creative office space with large floor plates, high ceilings and Class A amenities. In 2018, Partners Group invested in the complex by buying a portion of Square Mile\u2019s stake in a deal that valued the property at\n$400 million\n.\nIn 2020, the owners secured a\n$300 million\nCMBS loan from Credit Suisse subsidiary Column Financial. In July, Moody\u2019s downgraded the mortgage from AAA, to the equivalent of AA+, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nA representative for Atlas Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Partners Group declined to comment.\nWhile Manhattan\u2019s trophy towers have led a recent wave of leasing activity, outer-borough landlords have struggled to land tenants. Long Island City\u2019s availability rate hovered just below 27 percent in the first half of 2025, according to CBRE, compared to Manhattan\u2019s overall availability rate of 17.5 percent.\n",

        "content": "After months of deriding everyone and everything from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass to proposed wildfire recovery bills, Spencer Pratt is turning his focus to another piece of controversial legislation.\nThe reality TV personality has taken to social media to call out Senate Bill 79, the recently approved measure that would upzone areas near transit hubs to increase density, Politico\nreported\n.\nThe bill\npassed the California Senate last week\nand is headed to Newsom\u2019s desk. It calls for boosting housing density across the state by allowing apartment buildings of up to nine stories next to train stations and major transit stops. Most cities in California have zoned the land around transit stops for single-family homes.\nPratt\nblasted\nthe bill on Instagram, sharing a video of the January wildfires that\ndestroyed his Pacific Palisades home\nand urging followers to \u201cCall Newsom and tell him Palisades can\u2019t have more density\u201d and to \u201cStop SB 79.\u201d\nThere are no train stations or major transit hubs in the Pacific Palisades. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill, noted the concern over a non-issue for Pratt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s spreading a bald-faced lie, saying that SB 79 applies in the Palisades,\u201d Wiener told Politico. \u201cIt does not, and that is shameful.\u201d\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council passed a resolution expressing opposition to the plan with the support of Mayor Karen Bass. The bill ended up passing in the state legislature last week.\n\nPrior to the SB 79 outrage, Pratt criticized Senate Bill 549, which would establish a government body to determine a path forward after January\u2019s deadly wildfires. Opponents such as Pratt argued it would allow Los Angeles County to take over burned lots and sell them to the highest bidder.\n\u201cThe Hills\u201d star expressed his disdain for SB 549 in a series of videos on\nTikTok\n. He claimed he consulted with an artificial intelligence chatbot that told him the bill would allow L.A. County to buy burned lots in the Palisades and convert them into low-income housing, remove local zoning decisions and push for denser reconstruction in the area. That bill was\npaused in the legislature\nafter Bass raised concerns about its effects.\n\u201cInstead of a [recovery] plan to make the city affordable for its residents, we have Spencer Pratt influencing the mayor of L.A. to kill housing,\u201d Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY, told Politico.\nPratt also criticized Senate Bill 9, which was signed into law in 2021. The legislation was meant to address the state\u2019s housing shortage by allowing homeowners in most single-family residential zones to split their lot into separate parcels and build two units on a single lot. Following Pratt and Bass\u2019\ncriticism\nof the law, Newsom waived its enforcement in fire-prone areas.\nIt remains to be seen whether Newsom will sign SB 79 into law. As for Pratt\u2019s influence on the governor, it appears to be nonexistent.\n\u201cOur office doesn\u2019t communicate with Spencer Pratt,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the governor knows who he is.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Multifamily developers are getting their ducks in a row in Chicagoland, overcoming a tight market for raising equity and landing construction loans to take advantage of a limited construction pipeline.\nWill Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm Continuum Capital became the latest to take major steps toward getting a project out of the ground this week with a $31.2 million acquisition of\nChurch Street Plaza\nin downtown Evanston, a retail center eyed for redevelopment into a 27-story, 358-apartment tower. The deal was funded by a $26.5 million loan from Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital.\nTheir development venture, which also includes Aaron and Amy Galvin\u2019s firm Luxury Living, bought the 145,000-square-foot property from a venture of retail developer\nMitch Goltz\n, who acquired it in 2019 by assuming the remainder of a loan that a previous owner had taken out on the building. Goltz renovated the property and began leasing it up, then refinanced it with a $19.5 million loan from Old National Bank in 2023, public records show. It is 98 percent leased today.\nThe deal adds momentum to the Chicago-area apartment development pipeline, which has shrunk in recent years due to the rising costs of building materials and debt, plus a difficult environment for fundraising to make real estate acquisitions and capitalize construction projects. The result has been upward pressure on Midwest rents in existing buildings, which has drawn interest to the region from more institutional buyers.\nBut developers have begun reigniting the market in recent weeks.\nIn Chicago\u2019s West Loop,\nTim Anderson\u2019s firm Focus Development\n, along with partners DAC Developments and Melrose Ascension Capital, pulled in $96 million in construction financing to build a 287-unit apartment project at 1221 West Washington Street. An office-to-residential conversion project for\n65 East Wacker Place\nin Chicago that\u2019s being led by Adam Friedberg\u2019s firm Mavrek after an acquisition out of distress also scored a $90 million construction financing package.\n\nThe Evanston development team plans to dedicate 72 apartments resulting from the project to Evanston\u2019s affordable housing program by limiting them to households making certain fractions of the area median income.\n\u201cWhile our proposal for 900 Clark Street was not contingent on purchasing Church Street Plaza, this was a compelling opportunity to acquire a high-quality asset in a high-barrier-to-entry location,\u201d Continuum\u2019s co-founder Meador said.\nGoltz, the seller, declined to comment.\nThe Continuum team will work to start pre-construction involving the renovation of the retail into the base of the tower. It will seek a separate construction financing package for the approximately $130 million multifamily project.\nPreviously with\nMichigan Avenue Real Estate Group\n, which is backed by Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Meador helped lead the development of over 1,100 apartments in Chicago\u2019s West Loop and surrounding suburbs, including Evanston, where the firm built Maeve on Ridge, a luxury rental building at 1555 Ridge Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital is nearing the finish line to acquire New York City and San Francisco office landlord Paramount Group, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThis comes after a months-long\nmultiple-round bidding process\n, which included SL Green, Vornado, Blackstone, Empire State Realty and DivcoWest with Dubai-based Saray Capital, sources said.\nThrough the acquisition, Rithm, one of the largest mortgage servicers in the U.S., can expand deeper into commercial real estate amid an acquisition spree.\u00a0The news was first reported in the Wall Street Journal.\nIf the deal goes through, Rithm will take on Paramount\u2019s 17-building office portfolio in New York City and San Francisco, totaling 13 million square feet of space. Among the more notable properties: 1301 Sixth Avenue, 1633 Broadway and 900 Third Avenue in New York City\nParamount announced in May that it hired Bank of America as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives, including the possibility of a sale. The news came as the company and its CEO faced increasing scrutiny.\nParamount revealed earlier this year that it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to Behler\u2019s personal expenses and outside companies over the past three years. This included $900,000 on Behler\u2019s personal accounting services and $3 million on a private jet firm, co-owned by Behler.\nA short time later, an analyst at Green Street Advisors called for the removal of certain Paramount board members, citing management\u2019s high compensation relative to its stock performance.\nIn July, Paramount\ndisclosed it was under an investigation\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission in its second-quarter report.\n\nThe Real Deal\nreported in August that\nBehler personally pushed for a no-bid contract\nto a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager. Text messages reviewed by\nTRD\nshowed Behler and the employee maintained a friendly personal relationship years after their romantic relationship ended. (In those messages, the employee refers to Behler as \u201cAlbertcim,\u201d using a suffix meant to show endearment in the Turkish language, with the term roughly translating to \u201cmy dear Albert.\u201d)\nParamount has also seen an exodus of top employees in recent months. Paramount announced Wilbur Paes, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Gage Johnson, Paramount\u2019s general counsel, left the company.\nParamount was founded in 1978 by German mail-order entrepreneur Werner Otto. Behler was appointed as president and CEO in 1991. The firm went public in 2014 with an initial public offering of $2.3 billion, the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT at the time.\nParamount, like other office landlords, took a hit during the pandemic as occupancy dropped and employees worked from home. But as the office market has rebounded, Paramount\u2019s New York City portfolio is up to 88 percent leased as of its second quarter, the highest mark since 2022. In its most recent quarter, Paramount reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of $19.8 million.\nAs of today, Paramount has a market capitalization of $1.56 billion with its stock price hovering around $7, about half of what the stock was trading at prior to the pandemic.\nWhen the company announced its plan for a possible sale, Behler said the company and board \u201cremain focused closing the persistent gap between the company\u2019s public market valuation and our assessment of its intrinsic value.\u201d\nRithm, which has $36 billion in assets under management, has expanded from a mortgage servicing company. In 2023, it purchased the hedge fund Sculptor Capital Management. More recently, it inked a deal to buy Crestline, a $17 billion private lender.\n",

Penrod seeks to overturn the awarding of a new contract for the city-owned property at 1 Ocean Drive that is home to Nikki Beach Club. The 2023 complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also names Penrod\u2019s rival, Boucher Brothers, as a defendant.\nA bid by\nBoucher and Major Food Group\nwon the city\u2019s request for proposals, and the joint venture is set to take control of the property at 1 Ocean Drive next year when Penrod\u2019s current ground lease expires.\nBut dozens of texts by city staffers, recently released via the discovery process, could help Penrod bolster its case that Miami Beach officials violated procurement rules and showed bias in selecting a new operator.\nA text conversation on Sept. 2, 2023 between ex-Miami Beach City Attorney Raul Aguila, current city attorney Ricardo Dopico and chief deputy city attorney Nicholas Kallergis stands out.\nThe thread begins with Aguila texting his former colleagues a link to a\nMiami Herald\narticle detailing how Miami Beach rejected\nPenrod\u2019s bid\nbecause it was submitted 15 minutes after the city\u2019s deadline. \u201cHow STUPID are they???\u201d Aguila wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the dumbass who waited until [2:59 p.m.] to submit. Imagine there\u2019s a malpractice claim there,\u201d Dopico responded.\n\u201cI\u2019m having multiple orgasms just thinking about it. You guys have all the fun!!!!!!,\u201d Aguila replied.\n\u201cOmg for sure that kid is fired,\u201d Kallergis texted.\n\n\u201cWhat a fitting denouement for the Penrod\u2019s saga!\u201d Aguila shot back.\nAguila, who retired from the city in 2022, Dopico and Kallergis did not respond to requests for comment about the texts, which were first reported by\nMiami New Times\n. Daniel Hanlon, a lawyer representing Boucher, did not respond for comment either. A Miami Beach spokesperson declined to comment.\nPrintouts of the text messages were provided to\nThe Real Deal\nby a Miami Beach resident who requested anonymity.\nIn an emailed statement, Penrod said it sought court intervention to \u201crequire the city to hold a fair and lawful process for this public land.\u201d\n\u201cFormer city leaders violated laws requiring public competition which led to the challenge we brought,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe our position is supported by clear law and overwhelming evidence.\u201d\nCity officials faced intense public scrutiny over their handling of the 1 Ocean Drive property\u2019s future. Penrod has controlled the property since the 1980s via its ground lease, and the firm launched Nikki Beach Club in 1997. The name is in honor of late Jack Penrod\u2019s daughter Nicole, who was killed in a car accident the same year the venue was renamed from Penrod\u2019s on the Beach.\nIn April 2023, the Miami Beach City Commission initially voted to negotiate a no-bid deal with\nBoucher\n, which provides beach concessions under a separate city contract, and Major Food Group, the New York-based hospitality firm that owns Carbone and other high-end restaurants.\nA month later, commissioners\nreversed their decision\nafter a wave of public backlash, and voted for a competitive bid process that Boucher and Major Food Group subsequently won. The joint venture is getting a 10-year lease that the city claims will pay Miami Beach $41 million over the life of the agreement.\nDuring the discovery process,\nPenrod\nalso previously obtained emails showing then-Mayor Dan Gelber, then-Vice-Mayor Ricky Arriola and city staffers regularly hit up Boucher and Major Food Group principals for beach chairs and dinner reservations.",

Taylor, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and related charges, and his wife, Alejandra Maria Taylor, sold the 20,182-square-foot mansion at 6555 Southwest 102nd Street to CNEB LLC. The buyer is a Delaware entity that\u2019s tied to a land trust. The buyer financed the purchase with a $13.7 million loan from First Horizon Bank, property records show.\nThe 10-bedroom, 10-and-a-half-bathroom home, on a 2-acre lot,\nwas on the market for $21.8 million\nwith Julian Johnston of the Corcoran Group. Lorena Rodriguez with Serhant represented the buyer, according to the listing.\nIn 2022, Taylor was charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, investment adviser fraud and wire fraud; a separate securities fraud charge, and a separate investment adviser fraud charge. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Taylor, two other former senior portfolio managers at Allianz Global Investors US, and Allianz were involved in a massive investment fraud.\nTaylor pleaded guilty. He reached an agreement with the SEC that bars him from the securities industry and from the brokering or sales/purchases of penny stocks.\n\nThe scheme resulted in the loss of billions of dollars of pension fund money for teachers, clergy, bus drivers, engineers and other working professionals, according to the complaint.\nThe\nPinecrest\nestate, built in 2022, includes a pool deck, spa, cold plunge, a separate 1,000-square-foot gym, a tennis court and more, according to the listing. Taylor and his ex-wife Deborah paid $3.2 million for the property in 2017.\nThe latest sale beats a previous Pinecrest record. Last year, finance executive Andre Hakkak\npaid $14.3 million\nfor the spec mansion at 8900 Southwest 64th Court. Developer Francisco Dionicio\u2019s Dionicio Investment Group sold the property.\nMore recently in June, Major League Baseball pitcher Luis Severino\npaid $10.7 million\nfor the under-construction home at 10801 Southwest 67th Avenue in Pinecrest. The nearly 11,300-square-foot home includes seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a separate guest wing, summer kitchen, three-car garage, pool, sauna and steam room.\n",

        "content": "A Lake Forest estate that has hosted Chicago\u2019s elite for more than a century \u2014 and played a supporting role in an Oscar-winning film \u2014 is up for grabs for just under $7.5 million.\nDesigned in 1907 by architect Howard Van Doren Shaw and built the same year, the estate is hitting the market for the first time in 30 years, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Shaw\u2019s Georgian red-brick mansion, one of more than 40 he designed in\nLake Forest\n, sits on 2.5 acres at 788 East Woodland Road and spans 7,300 square feet with five bedrooms, formal gardens and sun porches. The asking price equates to $1,030 per square foot.\nThe home served as the set for the 1980 drama \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d directed by the late Robert Redford and starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars. The home\u2019s cameo cemented its place in Hollywood-Chicago lore.\nThe sellers are the heirs of Peggy Crowe, who bought the house with her husband, Jack, in the 1990s. The Crowes preserved the estate\u2019s historic character while adding modern touches, including a pool house by Liederbach &amp; Graham. Compass brokers Marina Carney and Andrew Mrowiec are handling the listing.\n\nDescribing its condition as \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cmeticulous,\u201d Carney told the outlet that all prior owners preserved the early 1900s design touches, including the ornate pine-paneled walls of the living room and limestone floors in the entrance hall. The listing also describes original French doors with restored brass cremone bolts, a garden room with panoramic views of the south lawn, hand-scraped pine floors and custom cabinetry in the kitchen, butler\u2019s pantry and breakfast room and a geothermally-heated swimming pool.\nIf it trades\nabove\n$7 million, the estate will join a small\nclub\nof Lake Forest homes to cross that threshold this decade. Only two have done so in recent years, though another \u2014 an 8-acre spread\nlisted\nat $15 million \u2014 has been under contract since July.\nThe house\u2019s pedigree extends beyond its architecture. Commissioned by banker Leverett Thompson and his wife, Helen, the estate quickly became one of Lake Forest\u2019s \u201cshow places,\u201d with gardens designed by Boston\u2019s Rose Standish Nichols and New York\u2019s Charles Platt. Later owners included members of the Chicago meatpacking dynasty Swift family.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Apartment starts in the region have fallen to just a few hundred per quarter from more than 3,000, per the Business Times. It aligns with a nationwide trend of 542,800 units under construction at the end of the second quarter \u2014 the lowest level in a decade, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nThe project from Bozzuto and Kimco\u2019s joint venture, known as\nThe Chester at Westlake\n, calls for a five-story mixed-use building that will house studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, most of which will come equipped with balconies or terraces. Residents will have access to 13,000 square feet of amenities as well as nearly 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s growing influence on the Bay Area has so far manifested in companies flocking to the region and setting up offices. Employees have followed, bringing in new renters to the Bay Area. With an expected influx of tens of thousands of AI workers over the next five years, office vacancy in San Francisco alone is predicted to be\ncut in half\n, according to CBRE.\nThe AI boom didn\u2019t play a part in The Chester at Westlake\u2019s construction, as Bozzuto began studying the site three years ago.\n\n\u201cI was bullish on Daly City,\u201d Bozzuto president and CEO Toby Bozzuto told the Business Times. \u201cThe AI jobs and the broader resurgence \u2014 that\u2019s just the icing on the cake.\u201d\nBozzuto and\nKimco\nare pursuing the project with financing from J.P. Morgan and a plan to use wood-frame construction and non-union labor as a means of lowering construction costs. In the Bay Area, most apartments are built for about $600,000 per unit, making new multifamily construction unfeasible for many developers.\nCurrent vacancy in San Mateo County is approaching a 20-year low at approximately 4 percent, per CoStar data cited by the Business Times. Rents, meanwhile, have risen 5 percent in the past year \u2014 the quickest spike since 2022.\nThe Chester at Westlake is scheduled to open by the end of 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Frost Bank is jumping ahead of the Federal Reserve by lowering mortgage rates and waiving some fees in a bid to grab market share across Texas.\nThe San Antonio-based bank rolled out a 50-basis-point cut on conventional and jumbo mortgages effective Sept. 8, bringing its 30-year fixed conventional rate to 6 percent, 15-year conventional to 5 percent, and both 30- and 15-year jumbo products to 5.75 percent.\nThe lender is also waiving up to $1,200 in administrative fees for all conventional and jumbo borrowers. Its Progress Mortgage division, geared toward low- and moderate-income borrowers, is priced at 5.75 percent and already carries a fee waiver, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe timing is notable: on Sept. 15, Bankrate pegged the average national 30-year fixed\nmortgage\nannual percentage rate at 6.39 percent and refinance APR at 6.73 percent. No other Texas lender has matched Frost\u2019s rate and fee package so far, though analysts expect broader declines after the Fed\u2019s Sept. 16\u201317 meeting.\n\u201cInstead of waiting for the Fed or the markets, we decided to lower the cost barrier for potential homebuyers or refinancers now,\u201d said Bill Day, senior vice president at Frost.\nThe math could help some potential home buyers\npull the trigger\non a purchase.\n\u201cOver the last 30 days, I\u2019m quoting 6 to 6.25 percent on conventional and FHA/VA loans, down from 6.75 to 7 percent,\u201d Brian Gutierrez of NEO Home Loans in San Antonio told the outlet.\n\nGutierrez said he is seeing a surge in first-time buyers targeting homes under $400,000, spurred by easing rates and seller concessions. In San Antonio, the average market time is 88 days \u2014 a 14-day increase from the San Antonio Board of Realtors\u2019 July report \u2014 and sellers are\noffering\n$7,500 to $12,000 in closing cost assistance.\nGutierrez said refinances are also climbing \u2014 up 42 percent year-over-year statewide, according to ATTOM Data Solutions \u2014 as borrowers look to shed debt and lock in savings. But he noted that high credit card balances, a byproduct of prolonged high interest rates, are still sidelining some would-be refinancers.\nFrost just jumped back into the mortgage business last year. The bank focuses on in-house servicing and is positioning itself as a market leader, Day said.\nFrost might have forced a rate war if competitors follow suit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Building New York City real estate is never easy. But some projects are more difficult than others.\nAfter years of hurdles, a 144-unit affordable and senior housing project in Forest Hills, Queens, has secured financing and is set to break ground. TD Bank loaned $37.5 million for construction, while Community Preservation Corp is providing a $40 million long-term loan. On the public side, the city is providing $71 million from a program for senior housing.\n\u201cAs an affordable housing developer, I\u2019ve never seen anything as difficult as this,\u201d said Jeff Fox, of Foxy Development, which is co-developing the project. \u201cNothing about this was easy.\u201d\nFrom conception to construction, the project changed plans several times. The property at 70-35 113th Street, dubbed The Perennial, is the site of an abandoned hospital. It was upzoned in 2020 with an agreement that it would include a certain amount of senior affordable housing.\nTypically, developers in these upzoned areas build their affordable and market-rate apartments in one building, with the market-rate units subsidizing the affordable units. But because of a complex ownership structure, the two portions of the project were kept separate, allowing Fox\u2019s team to pursue public financing for a fully affordable development while a market-rate development next door can still take advantage of the upzoning.\nAt one point, the Perennial was envisioned as a fully senior housing development, financed by tax-exempt state bonds, according to Fox. But that plan fell through, and the team scrapped their designs for 20 non-senior affordable units. The city provided funds, pledging money from its Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program.\n\nThe backstory of the financing lines up with promises of increased public-private partnerships touted by Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor. Mamdani has proposed tripling the city\u2019s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable housing. Fox said there were many times the Department of Housing Preservation and Development could have walked away from the deal, but officials wanted to make something happen despite setbacks and an out-of-the-box structure.\n\u201cThis is a part of Queens where we have long wanted to build more affordable housing,\u201d said Ahmed Tigani, acting commissioner of HPD. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need every part of the city to help build housing for the people who need it.\u201d\nThe plan is now to redevelop the interior of the hospital building while adding two stories on top. A section of the building will be carved out as the future home of the Forest Hills Jewish Center. The units will be available to households earning up to 50 percent of the area median income. HPD is also providing a rental subsidy through federal Section 8 funds. Of the 124 senior units, 20 will be set aside for formerly homeless seniors.\nServices for seniors will be provided by co-developer Selfhelp Realty Group, which focuses on senior housing. The Forest Hills site will be the company\u2019s first intergenerational property.\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity to start to look at something that we see as a priority for the city, moving more toward intergenerational housing,\u201d said Lisa Trub, executive director of Selfhelp. \u201cWe do think that we can kind of replicate a similar model and not be totally reliant on HPD financing.\u201d\nThe market rate development next door, which is owned separately and which the Fox and Selfhelp teams are not involved with, will be 13 stories and 241 units. TopRock Capital and RJ Holdings\nsecured $125 million last year\nto build condos on the site.\n",

        "content": "Continuing our \u201c\nEducating Zohran\n\u201d series\u2026\nToday, we offer more evidence that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to build affordable housing for $500,000 per unit (with union workers) is off by a factor of two.\nThe latest examples are the $150 million redevelopment of Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, which will yield 145 units of affordable and senior housing, and New Destiny Housing\u2019s $57 million Bronx development with 72 units, including 43 for domestic violence survivors.\nThe Queens project at 70-35 113th Street, by Jeff Fox\u2019s Foxy Development and Selfhelp Realty Group, also includes space for a Jewish center, so we can\u2019t just divide the total cost by the unit count to get a per-unit cost. But clearly, it\u2019s a lot more than $500,000. The typical cost of nonunion-built affordable housing in the city is about $800,000 per unit.\nMamdani\u2019s union construction would cost more, if affordable housing developers actually built that way. Which they don\u2019t.\nAs is customary with affordable housing, funding for the Queens and Bronx developments was patched together over several years from a plethora of sources.\nFoxy got a $37.5 million construction loan from TD Bank, a $40.1 million permanent loan from\nCommunity Preservation Corporation\n, a $70.7 million loan from HPD\u2019s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program, $18.24 million in federal HOME funds, and $3.625 million from state agency Homes and Community Renewal. Construction begins Wednesday.\nNew Destiny\u2019s project, which broke ground last week on Webster Avenue, includes $25 million from HPD\u2019s Supportive Housing Loan Program, $16 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, and $9.7 million from the OTDA\u2019s Homeless Housing and Assistance Program.\nIf you\u2019re not up on your acronyms, OTDA is the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. New Destiny also got help from the Corporation for Supportive Housing and Deutsche Bank\u2019s supportive housing arm.\nThis complicated array of funding sources, each of which takes time and comes with fees, is one reason affordable projects cost\nmore\nthan market-rate development.\nMamdani says he would simply issue $70 billion in bonds to pay for his housing. That would be simpler and more efficient, but not enough to cut per-unit costs in half. Regardless, a bond issuance of that size would require state approval, which is extremely unlikely.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s former counsel, Liz Fine, explained why in a\nrefreshingly honest op-ed\nlast week: \u201cThe government builds roads, bridges, public buildings, infrastructure, and even housing. But it is wildly expensive for the government to build housing and so at the end of the day, we need to rely on private developers.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nContrary to the common sentiment that rents never go down, in the nation\u2019s 50 largest metro areas, the median asking rent for units with two or fewer bedrooms dropped 2.2 percent year-over-year in August to $1,713, and is down 2.6 percent from the August 2022 peak, according to\nRealtor.com\n. That\u2019s 25 consecutive months of annual declines.

Soloviev is a grain fanatic with a voracious appetite for farmland.

        "content": "Rental apartments were harder to come by this summer in the wake of New York City\u2019s ban on broker fees.\nAcross the five boroughs, the number of rental listings fell in June, July and August compared to their year-ago totals, according to data provided by the Real Estate Board of New York. The trade group\u2019s analysis was based on all listings available on its residential listing service during the periods.\n\u201cThe FARE Act has created chaos and confusion in the residential rental market, is diminishing choice for tenants, increasing rents and costing the industry jobs,\u201d REBNY president James Whelan wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is bad policy, and it is only getting worse.\u201d\nInventory dropped 16 percent in June, the same month\nthe city implemented the FARE Act\nbarring landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired, according to REBNY\u2019s analysis.\nIn the months following the policy\u2019s enactment, the dip became even more pronounced. Inventory decreased 23 percent in July and 29 percent in August, according to data from the organization. As fewer apartments hit the market, prices rose on an annual basis in each of the three months, up 7 percent in June and July and 11 percent in August.\nHowever, the inventory problem is likely less dire than the trade group\u2019s analysis reflects. Other groups, such as data analytics platform UrbanDigs, have lamented that rental data has been\nharder to track\nwith fewer listings hitting the RLS. Other data sources, such as StreetEasy, capture a larger swatch of apartments and include citywide numbers that are, in some cases, more than three times the figures REBNY reported.\nData from StreetEasy also shows a decline in inventory across the city, though its metrics indicated a more gradual reduction, with inventory falling just 2 percent in June, 11 percent in July and 9 percent in August.\nManhattan logged the most substantial decrease, with inventory dipping 7 percent in June, 18 percent in July and 13 percent in August, according to data from StreetEasy. But apartment listings in Brooklyn and Queens remained much steadier, with both boroughs notching small upticks in June followed by modest declines between 2 percent and 5 percent in the following two months.\n\u201cThis was more about optics than it was about the actual impacts,\u201d Corcoran\u2019s chief operating officer Gary Malin said of the law, which he described as decreasing transparency in the market and making it harder for tenants to find apartments on their own. \u201cThey\u2019re taking the industry back to before the internet.\u201d\nTight market squeezes brokers, renters\nThough REBNY largely attributes the upset to the FARE Act, other factors are likely at play, especially in Manhattan, where competition for apartments was already tight, according to a\nreport from StreetEasy\npublished earlier this summer.\nWhile rent prices are on the rise, in part due to landlords attempting to offset the cost of broker fees, the same market constrictions contributing to the drop in inventory are also pushing prices higher. In New York City, the struggle with\nhousing affordability\nis a longstanding issue that predates the new legislation, and other laws, such as\nGood Cause Eviction\n, have a hand in the recent market.\nThe summer months are also typically the busiest times of year for the city\u2019s rental market, and the attention around the adoption of the FARE Act may have spurred even more activity than usual, according to\na report\nfrom Openigloo based on a survey of its users. The rate of lease renewals between June and August fell from 69 percent in 2024 to 59 percent in 2025.\n\u201cI think the FARE Act had a part to play,\u201d said Allia Mohamed, Openigloo\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cRenters felt empowered and had more flexibility to enter the rental market.\u201d\n\nDespite higher rents, Openigloo\u2019s report found that tenants still saved money without the cost of the broker fee \u2014 about $1,300 per unit annually.\nREBNY sought to halt the FARE Act from taking effect ahead of its implementation day, though federal judges have repeatedly denied the trade group\u2019s request, including the\nlatest decision\nhanded down by an appeals court judge last month. REBNY is suing the city over the law.\nStill, brokers dealing in rentals are contending with the fallout while the law stays in place.\n\u201cOwners are getting squeezed, and brokers are working harder for their money,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht. \u201cIt\u2019s competitive.\u201d\nThe policy has pushed landlords to negotiate with brokers, Hecht added, many of whom will agree to collect a smaller fee from property owners with large portfolios. The norm used to be about a month of rent, but now some agents are taking less than that, though how much less varies and, in part, coincides with the cost of the apartment.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tough, and you say, \u2018I\u2019m only going to work for a month or nothing,\u2019 you could lose a big account,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go down the block and hire someone else.\u201d\nThe key to survival is pulling on existing relationships with landlords, who already trust in the value of their agents\u2019 services, Hecht said. However, winning new business has been a tougher sell.\n\u201cIt makes the pitch harder,\u201d Hecht said.\nCompass broker James Finelli said the FARE Act will hit new agents harder, who lack proven track records with property owners.\n\u201cPeople who have established businesses, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be severely impacted,\u201d said Finelli. \u201cIf [landlords] are going to elect to pay a fee, they\u2019re going to be more scrupulous on the person.\u201d\nBoth Finelli and Hecht agreed that those likely to absorb most of the law\u2019s impact are tenants, who are seeing asking rents go up even higher and who are having a tougher time finding available apartments. To access that inventory, some are hiring brokers and agreeing to pay a fee on top of paying an elevated asking rent.\nThe Agency\u2019s Evan Roth added that, at some point, something\u2019s gotta give.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker kind of situation. Just how much can these renters take,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s more of a shift back to the sales market.\u201d\n",

EDI requires 100 percent affordable housing.\nThe infill site, at 7040-46 Baird Avenue, is a 16,000-square-foot parcel near the corner of Reseda and Baird avenues. There are currently four small cottages on it, all built in the 1930s, according to the county assessor. Two of the homes have one bedroom and one bathroom and clock in at 576 square feet a piece. Two cottages comprise two bedrooms and one bathroom and each span 804 square feet.\n\nMeirson bought 7040-46 Baird Avenue in July for $875,000, according to the deed. He seeks regulatory relief and development bonuses from the city in exchange for including affordable housing units.\nThe Baird Avenue proposal now on file fits the same pattern as Meirson\u2019s two nearby projects, at 15931 West Victory Boulevard and 7112 North Baird Avenue, per city planning documents.\nThe former calls for demolishing five rental units and replacing it with a six-story building with 100 units that will be 100 percent affordable. The structure would span 68,000 square feet, JZA\u2019s website indicates.\nThe latter is slated to be a six-story, 34-unit building. Meirson is working with JZA on both of those applications.\nJeff Zbikowski, founder of JZA,\nnoted\nin early 2024 that a lot of the ED1 projects he was aware of were in South L.A., but ones were starting to \u201cpop up in nicer areas on the Westside or in the Valley and Reseda, some of these higher-resource areas, where they\u2019re more centered around hedging against nicer areas \u2014 providing mixed-income projects within those areas that are always going to be occupied.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In order to cover retirement checks as the city waits for property tax revenue to replenish its dwindling coffers, Chicago will lend cash to its pensions, avoiding asset sales.\nThe delayed collection stems from a computer issue.\nThe city advanced $28 million this month to the Firemen\u2019s Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund so it wouldn\u2019t need to dump stocks, bonds or other assets to cover retiree benefits, according to city finance officials. City of Chicago CFO Jill Jaworski told aldermen the city is monitoring the cash needs of all four pension funds \u2014 covering firefighters, police, laborers and municipal workers \u2014 and will lend as needed until Cook County\u2019s property tax mess is resolved, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe issue stems from a\nbungled\ncomputer system overhaul at the county, which pushed back the second installment of property tax bills by weeks. Normally, about 55 percent of Chicago\u2019s $1.77 billion levy comes in during March, with the rest arriving in August. Roughly 80 percent of that levy flows directly into pensions, meaning delays hit the funds hard.\nThe computer system overhaul \u2014 work that was contracted to Texas-based Tyler Technologies \u2014 has amounted to years of missed deadlines on the project, meaning property tax bills had still not been mailed out for payments that should have come due June 30. Property owners have a month to pay once those bills are received, potentially meaning actual revenue won\u2019t fill county coffers until the end of October.\nCity Clerk Anna Valencia, who sits on the firefighter pension board, said that she\u2019s glad the city acted to avoid selling off assets, but she also pressed the county to spell out how and when it will fix the billing problem.\n\nChicago Public Schools is also\nsuffering\nfrom the delay, racking up penalties on late payments to its teachers\u2019 fund. By the end of last month, that delay already piled almost $2.5 million in interest owed on the school district\u2019s $247 million pension fund payment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time City Hall has played banker for its pensions. In late 2023, the city advanced about $425 million in similar stopgap loans, and in 2022, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot pushed more than $500 million forward when federal aid left the budget flush. That cushion is gone now. Mayor Brandon Johnson is\nstaring\ndown a $1.15 billion city budget deficit, dwindling reserves and growing pension costs as federal relief money dries up.\nThe firefighter fund illustrates the stakes. As of year-end 2023, it carried nearly $7.5 billion in long-term liabilities but just $1.8 billion in assets, a funded ratio of 23.7 percent. That\u2019s far below the national average of about 78 percent for large public pensions. Recent benefit hikes may push it lower still.\nThe city\u2019s loans\nbuy\ntime for now. But with Johnson\u2019s proposed $300 million property tax hike dead on arrival last year, and a state mandate to get pensions to 90 percent funded by 2055, the bills are only getting harder to juggle.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The investments were to be held in an escrow account with FPR US 1.\n\u201cFPR has been nothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d investors allege in the suit, adding that their capital hasn\u2019t been returned to them.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit,\u201d and said it intends \u201cto defend vigorously against them in court.\u201d\nCain did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn 2022, OKO Group and Cain, led by Jonathan Goldstein, scored a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan for One River at 629 Southeast Fifth Avenue.

No other commencement notices were recorded.\nOKO Group had bought the site as part of its\n$63 million\npurchase of a larger 6.7-acre assemblage south of the New River in downtown Fort Lauderdale in 2020. One River was marketed as the first tower in a multi-phase development.\nAccording to the suit, some of the investors financially backed One River through\nCrowdStreet\n. The New York-based crowdfunding platform faced heavy criticism after real estate investor Elie Schwartz pleaded guilty this year to wire fraud tied to diverting nearly $63 million of investor funds meant for Atlanta and Miami Beach offices for his personal use.\nFor more than three years, OKO Group has given regular updates on One River, according to the lawsuit. Its first quarter report showed the firm is continuing the same work that it reported in past updates, the lawsuit says. This includes putting forth general contractor bids for price feedback, and continuing talks with general contractors and construction management firms over the site and pricing. Yet, OKO still hasn\u2019t secured an \u201cactionable\u201d guaranteed maximum price from a general contractor, according to the complaint and the first quarter report.\nOKO and Cain have partnered on other projects across South Florida. The pair completed the fully leased 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year. The building attracted many new-to-market companies that moved to South Florida in the past half decade.\nIn Palm Beach, OKO and Cain propose an\nAman-branded\ncondo complex with three five-story buildings. The project will replace the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard and Edgewater at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nThe lawsuit comes as South Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared with the boom of recent years. The influx of out-of-staters had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and rent growth, and developers seized on the bonanza by quickly building new projects.\nMore recently, the construction frenzy has led to an apartment supply overhang, resulting in slower lease-ups and rent growth. Asking rents are either flat or declining across South Florida submarkets. For the past year, developers have been\ncanceling or pausing\ntheir multifamily projects amid elevated interest rates and higher construction costs.\n",

        "content": "After more than two years of vying for public support for its casino proposal, SL Green Realty is officially out of the running.\nCommunity Advisory Committees on Wednesday voted 4-2 to disapprove SL Green Realty\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday asked if he could speak, but was told that the commission was not hearing public comment. Once the meeting was over, he stood up and chastised the committee members, aside from those appointed by the mayor and governor, who were the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met the standard, and then some.\u201d\nHe then quickly exited the meeting.\nThe no votes mean two Manhattan proposals remain. A CAC vote on Silverstein Properties\u2019 proposal is slated for later Wednesday.\n\nThe other Manhattan bid is Soloviev Group and Mohegan\u2019s $11 billion Freedom Plaza on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. The CAC tasked with reviewing that project is slated to vote on the proposal on Sept. 22. Five other bids also await CAC votes, which will determine if\nthe projects\nhead to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which will award three casino licenses. The board is expected to do so by the end of the year.\nSL Green, which teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, proposed converting its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway into a casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nThe team also committed to $250 million in community investments, as well as allowing investors with as little as $500 to acquire equity in the project.\nSL Green\u2019s odds were lowered by the casino approval process itself. Members of the CAC were appointed by elected officials, including Sen. Liz Krueger, who made\nclear\nthat she did not support a casino in Manhattan. The project also faced fierce opposition from the Broadway League, an influential trade group that represents the city\u2019s theater industry, which argued that a casino would siphon from rather than complement Times Square businesses and entertainment venues.\nThe CACs that reviewed the remaining proposals must vote on their respective projects by Sept. 30.\nAhead of this key vote, some teams have continued to add perks to their proposals in an effort to make their projects more competitive. At its second public hearing, Soloviev increased the number of affordable housing units it will build from 513 to 600.\n",

Jill Eber with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal.\nThe sale marked\na price record for the neighborhood,\ntrumping\nBarstool Sports founder David Portnoy\u2019s\nprevious $14 million purchase as Morningside\u2019s most expensive home.\nSimkins is the son of the late Leon Simkins, the longtime president of their family\u2019s paper products giant Simkins Industries. The firm was known for pioneering the production of paperboard products. David Simkins\u2019 brother, Michael Simkins, heads Lion Development Group, is CEO of E11even Crypto and an owner of E11even Partners, which owns the nightclub, hotel and vodka brands of the same name. His projects in Miami include the 449-unit\nE11even Club Hotel &amp; Residences\nand 550-unit\nE11even Club Residences Beyond\n.\n\nEarlier this month, David Simkins sold his waterfront North Bay Village home for\n$13.5 million\n. He bought the 3,700-square-foot house for $3.1 million in 2016, according to property records.\nHis new Morningside pad, dubbed \u201cWhispering Pines,\u201d spans 0.9 acres, property records show. It was built in 1969, and the 3,900-square-foot home has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, the listing shows. The estate also has a 140-year-old gazebo, a treehouse, a music studio, pool, dock and 125 feet of waterfront.\nWallack listed it for $20.9 million in May, according to Zillow.\nPrice growth has been near-universal in South Florida since the pandemic triggered a luxury market boom five years ago. The degree differs from neighborhood to neighborhood, though. Morningside\u2019s neighbor Bay Point saw\na record $85 million\nsale for a waterfront estate earlier this year.",

Units will range from one to three bedrooms, with prices from $1.8 million to $10 million, the release shows.\nLefferts founder, Mendy Chudaitov, tapped Italian architect Piero Lissoni to design the tower. Amenities in the building will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, lounge, padel court, kids\u2019 room, and private beach club access through a partnership with the\nBoucher Brothers\n.\nMiami Beach-based Lefferts acquired the non-waterfront assemblage for a combined $14.3 million over two decades, records show.\nThe launch follows the completion of Lefferts\u2019 first North Beach condo project,\n72 Park\n, earlier this year. Closings for the 22-story, 206-unit short-term rental-friendly tower at 580 72nd Street \u2013\u2013 which is adjacent to the 72 Carlyle site \u2013\u2013 started in March. Lefferts also launched sales for its planned\nPalma Miami Beach Residences\nat 600 71st Street last year, with condo prices starting at $650,000. Cervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing for the project, which is 40 percent presold, Chudaitov confirmed.\n\nChudaitov said his target demographics for 72 Carlyle are locals, out-of-state buyers from feeder markets like California and New York, and investors.\u00a0 The project is intended to provide \u201cobtainable luxury\u201d for buyers interested in proximity to the beach (which is five blocks away), he said, \u201cThe price point is really the sweet spot in this market.\u201d\nElliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund said he also anticipates the project appealing to location-focused locals, rather than international buyers who are more drawn to branded residences and supertalls. Eklund says North Beach is in the early stages of a luxury evolution.\n\u201cThis is like NoHo 10 years ago I would say,\u201d he said, referencing the once-overlooked Manhattan neighborhood.\nIn 2017, Miami Beach residents voted to increase density for developments in North Beach, setting the stage for a new wave of investment in the neighborhood. Lefferts\u2019 completion of 72 Park marked the first new condominium in\nNorth Beach\nin five years.\nAside from Lefferts\u2019 projects, the rezoning spurred developments like Northlink Capital\u2019s planned\n7200 Collins\n. The 12-story, 222-unit project is slated for 7200 Collins Avenue, on the former site of Denny\u2019s. Sales launched for the non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condos in April, with prices starting at $600,000. In March, Constellation Group, Boschetti Group and Vietmar landed a $42.3 million construction loan for their planned\nElla Miami Beach\n. The 10-story, 103-unit non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condo project at 6940 Abbott Avenue has prices starting at $500,000.\nOther projects in North Beach\u2019s pipeline include the Meruelo family and Terra\u2019s planned 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project at the 3.8-acre oceanfront\nDeauville Beach Resort\nat 6701 Collins Avenue. Witkoff Group has also joined Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher on their stalled\nOcean Terrace\nproject on the site spanning 7409 to 7449 Collins Avenue and 7400 to 7450 Ocean Terrace, which includes a 20-story, 75-unit luxury condo.",

The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.

        "content": "The former Vornado leasing executive accused of stealing more than $9 million from the firm allegedly created fake brokerages and burner accounts to bill the REIT for phony services over a 15-year period, according to federal prosecutors.\nJared Solomon\nwas arrested in December and charged by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with stealing $9.5 million from his employer. The feds do not identify the company, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it is Vornado Realty Trust.\nAccording to the prosecutors, Solomon defrauded the company by creating fake brokerage companies named Margoux Media and Cobalt Advisors, and then submitting invoices to Vornado for work he claimed the companies had performed.\n\u201cThe defendant carried out his fraud scheme by using fake commercial real estate agreements \u2014 mainly fake broker agreements, among other types of agreements \u2014 and fake invoices that called for Victim Company-1 to issue checks and wire payments to one of three purported real estate broker companies,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.\nThe third company is an actual brokerage, though prosecutors said the firm had no knowledge that Solomon was submitting invoices in its name.\nOn several fake agreements, Solomon allegedly copied and pasted a signature he had access to from an executive who did a bona fide licensing agreement with Vornado in 2015, and then claimed the executive was the chief financial officer of the fictitious Margoux Media.\n\nSolomon allegedly used fake email addresses and burner phone numbers to communicate with higher-ups at Vornado who had concerns about the payments. After the company made a $1.4 million payment to the Margoux account in 2019, Solomon allegedly used the money to buy a pricey Manhattan home.\n\u201cOnly one week later, the defendant, in turn, wired that amount, plus nearly $1 million in additional fraud proceeds that the defendant had previously obtained from Victim Company-1, to a real estate attorney to finance part of the purchase of a $4 million apartment located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nSolomon and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Southern District attorney\u2019s office revealed the new details earlier this month when responding to Solomon\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the charges\n. The prosecutors refuted his argument that the indictment was overly vague, stating that it met the required standard.\nProsecutors earlier this year told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle for Solomon to change his not guilty plea. But since then, the defendant has changed attorneys and no formal agreement has been reached.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "In the 1990s, fashion designers descended twice per year on Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park to preview their upcoming collections to buyers and reporters in tents.\nIn the years since, New York Fashion Week has grown into an extensive public spectacle, staged against backdrops across the city with designers looking far and wide for backdrops to accentuate their seasonal visions.\nAlthough a runway show is often just a one-day affair, industry experts say the glitz and glamour of these events can bring visibility and cultural cache to a venue.\nThat\u2019s been the case for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, according to Joyce Duverce, senior vice president of impact and partnerships at the yard\u2019s development corporation.\nThe Navy Yard, which is 300 acres of industrial space, has hosted two fashion shows. In 2023, Bronx native Ralph Lauren turned a warehouse in the yard into a barn-style runway show, followed by a seated dinner under chandeliers (in attendance: JLo, Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern, and Julianne Moore). In 2024, although not part of fashion week, Victoria\u2019s Secret hosted its runway show at the Yard\u2019s Duggal Greenhouse.\n\u201cIt brings the audience,\u201d Duverce said. \u201cWe have over 550 businesses here, but I don\u2019t think most people know that we have the capacity to host such large events.\u201d\nBeyond any promotion, big events have also helped bring business to the yard\u2019s tenants, including fabricators and lighting vendors, according to Duverce.\nAnd if a space is particularly noteworthy, an event can potentially lead to long-term leasing opportunities for a venue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had people reach out to us directly after showing in a beautiful new space or a commercial building saying, \u2018Do you have the real estate agent to contact? Are they renting space in the building? Is there retail space available?\u2019\u201d said Robert Kalas, an executive producer at La Mode En Images, a production company.\nThe right fit\nNot every space can draw in fashion week clients for a runway show. First, there are basic conditions to be met.\n\u201cDesigners are always looking for a large space that\u2019s column-free, that no one has ever done a fashion show in before, that\u2019s located in Manhattan, that\u2019s ground floor with 800 amps, three-phase power,\u201d Kalas said.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a drive for anything iconic to New York, anything industrial, and anything with views of the city. Some of the more offbeat fashion week venues have included the New York Public Library, the city\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court, and the NBA Player\u2019s Association practice facility.\nEvents have certainly shifted from just 34th Street, but still cluster in a handful of Manhattan neighborhoods \u2014 Soho, Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, the West Village and Tribeca \u2014 with an occasional foray out to Brooklyn. That\u2019s in part because shows are timed so closely together, leaving busy attendees with little time to travel.\n\nMoney to be made\nSome venues, like the Altman Building in Chelsea or 28 Liberty in the Financial District, run a year-round events business.\nFor those properties, fashion week brings significant exposure, letting patrons see the venue often in a new light. But the direct monetary impact of any single event may be limited. The Altman Building, where Sandy Liang and Private Policy have debuted their new work, charges a fixed rate for events, meaning no markup for fashion clients.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a celebration of life or a gala dinner, it really is the same price to host an event with us,\u201d said Ariel Swain, director of venue sales and marketing at the Altman Building. \u201cAny opportunity to showcase the space in a different light is an opportunity for us to have other events with the people who are in attendance.\u201d\nBut a business in short-term events can provide visibility and limit risk in an unpredictable real estate landscape, said Sara Altobelli, who runs marketing for Hush Venues.\nHush manages events at 28 Liberty\u2019s Halo space, where Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang have both had models walk the runway, circling the venue\u2019s 1964 Noguchi sculpture garden. Hush partners exclusively with venues and then runs all the events in a space.\n\u201cFashion Week gets a lot of press and attention,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cFrom a cultural aspect, it\u2019s an incredible angle to be part of this very New York thing that is Fashion Week.\u201d\nIf done right, the result can also be profitable. Karrie Goldberg, founder and CEO at The Kagency, partners directly with property owners and developers to score a calendar of shorter-term events, including runway shows. For the right venue, such a business can net up to three times the profits of a traditional retail lease, she said.\n\u201cIf you look at a 10,000-square-foot space that is fully finished \u2014 as in, it could be a raw space but you have all the base amenities \u2014 you could be paying anywhere from\n20 to 25 grand\nfor the day,\u201d she said.\nSome developers, Goldberg said, are happy to run that business year-round. But others use her agency to monetize time between more traditional tenants, giving access to their space for just 90 days.\nThough fashion houses occasionally reach out directly, much of the business is through public relations or production companies. The Kagency manages bookings for more than 500 venues across multiple cities and has run shows with multiple fashion clients, including Proenza Schouler at the Chelsea Factory, and Ulla Johnson at Powerhouse Arts, a former power plant in Gowanus.\nAlthough the marketing potential from a runway show can last, the show itself is fleeting.\n\u201cThe show is 15 minutes and then everything gets taken down,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cIt all happens in a New York minute, and then it all goes away.\u201d\n",

Atlanta-based Acre and Farmingdale-based Nord Development Group are the partners behind the project at 214 West Main Street.\nBank OZK led the way with a $95 million construction loan, while PGIM picked up the slack with $19.2 million in mezzanine debt. The total package adds up to $114.2 million in financing.\nA JLL team including Peter Rotchford, Jose Cruz and Jesse Wright arranged the financing. Nord and Acre did not immediately comment on the transaction to the Observer.\nThe development will deliver 209 market-rate apartments and 53 affordable units.

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is considering dumping the remaining units at his Mandarin Oriental Residences.\nShvo and the other investors behind the project at 685 Fifth Avenue, which includes Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, hired Eastdil Secured to find a buyer for the unsold condos in a bulk deal, sources familiar with the matter told\nBloomberg\n.\nA bulk sale would end the developers\u2019\nfour-year struggle\nto offload condos at the Midtown property, where fewer than one-third of its 65 units have traded so far. The developers tapped Douglas Elliman to head sales at the project, though listings for the remaining sponsor units are no longer available on Streeteasy.\nNews of the plans for a bulk deal comes about a year after the developers scored a\n$120 million\ninventory loan from the Northwind Group. At the time, only 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million.\nA spokesperson for Shvo confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the investor group was mulling over a potential sale, following a\nsimilar strategy\nit employed at the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills. Last year, the partnership sold 44 sponsor units at the project to Centurion Real Estate Partners after defaulting on a $200 million loan.\nIn a statement, Shvo\u2019s spokesperson pointed to the partnership\u2019s shift from focusing on residential development to office projects. \u201cWe are continuing to execute on that strategy with the potential bulk sale of remaining units at 685 5th Avenue,\u201d the spokesperson said. Shvo, however,\nrecently sold\none of his planned mixed-use projects on Alton Road in Miami Beach to Infinity. The spokesperson added that the firm has invested $250 million in its office portfolio.\n\nSpokespeople for Eastdil and BVK declined Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment. A spokesperson for Deutsche Finance America did not immediately respond to the outlet\u2019s request.\nShvo and his partners bought 685 Fifth, formerly known as the Gucci building, for $135 million in 2018, three years after Shvo\u2019s first bid to buy the building fell through. The developers converted the office portion of the building into condos and added five floors of residences.\nSince sales of the fully-furnished units launched in December 2021, some units have traded for steep discounts, including a 3,400-square-foot apartment that sold last October for\n$17 million\n\u2014 significantly less than its last asking price of $22 million.\nBuyers at the Mandarin Oriental sued the development group and Shvo last year over allegations that construction on their $6 million one-bedroom condo did not line up with agreed-upon plans. A New York judge\ndismissed Shvo\nas an individual defendant in the suit, though the case is still pending.\nShvo has also been locked in a legal battle with the Core Club, a tenant at his 711 Fifth Avenue office building. The developer is in the\nprocess of evicting\nthe private members club, which sued him last year for $600 million. Last month, a New York judge ruled that the Core Club\nowed Shvo\n$1 million for defaulting on a loan.\n\u2014\nSheridan Wall\n",

        "content": "The Pierre has long stood as one of Manhattan\u2019s most gilded properties, a Versailles-inspired tower overlooking Central Park that housed everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Coco Chanel.\nBut today, its aging elevators, shabby lobby and thinning roster of power players have set the stage for a bitter fight over its future \u2014 and at the center of it is Howard Lutnick.\nThe billionaire bond trader-turned-Trump Commerce Secretary owns the Pierre\u2019s penthouse, the building\u2019s largest apartment, and, by extension, the most co-op shares. According to the\nNew York Times\n, Lutnick pushed for a management shakeup two years ago, which led the board to ultimately hire Lutnick\u2019s own firm, Newmark, to advise on upgrades.\nThat pivot has spiraled into late-stage talks to sell the entire property at 795 Fifth Avenue for\nroughly $2 billion\n. The prospective deal would involve funding from the Khashoggi family and management by the Dorchester Collection, owned by the sultan of Brunei.\nIf approved, the sale could force out famous residents, including former Disney chief Michael Eisner, designer Tory Burch and media heiress Shari Redstone. Older owners in their 80s and 90s are furious, arguing they\u2019ve poured fortunes into renovations only to face eviction.\n\u201cTo find new accommodations and go through the trauma\u2026 would seriously affect my health, well-being and finances,\u201d longtime resident Tina Beriro, 84, wrote in an email obtained by the Times.\n\nLutnick, who hasn\u2019t lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, is distancing himself. A spokesperson for his department said he hasn\u2019t been involved in discussions for months and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away when Trump tapped him for his administration post.\nStill, the perception lingers that Newmark \u2014 poised to reap tens of millions in fees \u2014 set the deal in motion with Lutnick\u2019s blessing.\nThe outcome rests with the co-op\u2019s shareholders. Any sale requires approval from two-thirds of its shares, meaning Lutnick\u2019s oversized stake could prove decisive.\nSupporters frame the choice as cashing out at a profitable value versus footing astronomical assessments for long-delayed repairs. Opponents fear the loss of their homes to foreign owners with controversial ties.\nThe building\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled this week in the Pierre\u2019s Cotillion ballroom, where tempers will likely be raw. For a building long synonymous with luxury, the fight may determine whether its next chapter is one of restoration or exile.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Ian Bruce Eichner unloaded a Crown Heights\ndevelopment site\nat the center of a fierce zoning fight over shadows on the nearby Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nIsaac Schwartz snapped up 970 Franklin Avenue for $54.3 million from Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company, according to a press release from JLL. The site is approved for a 10-story building with 355 units, of which 106 must be income-restricted.\nJLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton, Brendan Maddigan and Michael Mazzara arranged the sale.\nThe deal closes a tumultuous chapter for Continuum, which spent six years trying to push through rezonings that would have allowed larger multifamily projects on the site. The City Planning Commission scaled back Eichner\u2019s proposal to reduce shadows on the Garden.\nIn exchange for lower building heights, Council member Crystal Hudson let Continuum use the \u201cworkforce housing\u201d option in the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which allowed for higher rents. Continuum also reduced the project\u2019s slope from its initial proposal, allowing more sunlight to reach the Garden\u2019s plant nursery and other areas. The Council approved the rezoning in November.\n\nThe road to consensus was long and rough. Eichner bought the site in 2017 for $33 million and had sought to build two 39-story towers with more than 1,500 apartments on a site that also included 960 Franklin Avenue. Roughly half of the units would have been set aside as affordable.\nThat bid never made it far, largely because of opposition from the Garden. The 960 Franklin site was then\nsold for $43 million\nin 2022 to Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler, who in turn\nsold it to another developer\n, Yitzchok Schwartz, for\n$64 million\n. Schwartz plans 300 condo units across seven stories and 240,000 square feet, which he can build without political approval. (It\u2019s unclear whether Isaac Schwartz, who bought the adjacent 970 Franklin, is the same as this Yitzchok Shwartz, given Yitzchok is the Hebrew version of the name Isaac.)\nEichner pushed ahead with his remaining portion of the site and filed a new application to rezone it. The City Planning Commission shortened the towers to reduce the shadow impact to roughly half an hour per day, only to have Eichner deem that financially infeasible and\nthreaten to withdraw the application\n.\nBut he didn\u2019t, and now Schwartz will decide whether to proceed with Eichner\u2019s project. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA lawyer for Continuum declined to comment. Eichner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Chikoo Patel is drowning in debt.\nAmerican Express is the latest among a slew of lenders going after the embattled Chicago landlord in Cook County court, citing an unpaid credit card balance of over $63,000 following a missed minimum payment earlier this summer, according to a lawsuit filed last week.\nIt\u2019s a small dollar figure compared to the scale of his real estate collapse, which so far includes about $20 million in alleged debts or broken contracts across Illinois. But the new lawsuit shows how deep of a financial hole Patel has dug along his journey from up-and-coming investor to embattled defendant.\nPatel\u2019s profile was rising for years as a landlord and large-scale property manager in Chicago\u2019s South Side apartment market. Through his company,\nCKO Real Estate\n, he acquired and took on management for dozens of rental buildings in neighborhoods like South Shore. He brought in outside investors to help bankroll acquisitions, promising steady returns, while positioning himself as a key player in affordable housing. For a while, the strategy worked, until tenants, and then lenders, began to see the cracks.\nNow, at least one of Patel\u2019s frequent investment partners,\nShai Wolkowicki\n, is distancing himself from the financial turmoil.\n\u201cWe have not been associated with Chikoo Patel or CKO Real Estate since the beginning of February, when we parted ways. We have had new management in place since that time,\u201d Wolkowicki said in an email. He didn\u2019t provide an interview or respond to follow-up questions about the path to recovery for his investments or the size of his and CKO\u2019s real estate portfolio.\nPatel didn\u2019t return multiple requests for an interview.\nBuildings under CKO\u2019s control deteriorated, and financial woes followed. Wolkowicki has been named a defendant along with Patel in a $16 million lawsuit brought by Old National Bank over a Springfield multifamily deal that has sunk into distress. Wolkowicki also took over decision-making authority from Patel for Rockford properties as they were sold off earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the transactions.\n\nAt CKO\u2019s Chicago buildings, maintenance requests went unanswered. Mold, pests, broken heating systems and unsafe stairwells became common complaints. This spring, tenants organized and took their fight public. South Shore renters pleaded with city officials to be released from their leases, saying they felt scammed out of rent and deposits while Patel\u2019s team ignored basic repairs. One resident\ntold\nBlock Club that living in a CKO building felt like being \u201ctrapped,\u201d with no way out short of legal intervention.\nThe city eventually stepped in. In April, Chicago officials sued the owners of a South Shore courtyard building formerly managed by CKO, citing hazardous, slum-like conditions that posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to tenants. The city sought a court-appointed receiver to take over management and make repairs at 6952-58 South Paxton Avenue, where residents had gone without heat and hot water after CKO shuttered operations. Patel was summoned to court alongside the property owners and lenders, though he\ntold\nthe Triibe he hadn\u2019t been associated with the buildings for \u201csome months.\u201d\nAs property conditions worsened, Patel\u2019s financial troubles multiplied. Lender Itria Ventures, which provides small-businesses capital in exchange for pledging their future revenues toward repayment, sued CKO and Patel earlier this year seeking over $115,000 in alleged debt that fell into default, according to documents obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. CKO and its affiliates borrowed $150,000 a year ago in exchange for pledging to repay $192,000, but began missing payments by February, public records show.\nItria dismissed its lawsuit but appears to have plans to re-file it; an attorney for securitized mortgage lenders appeared in the case on behalf of entities that own property set to be seized from borrowers with ties to Patel. The loans on those properties, at 541 East 80th and 8100 South May streets in Chicago, totaled over $1 million and were originated by locally based lender\nRenovo Financial\n.\nThe revelations painted a picture of a multifamily operator stretched thin, using other people\u2019s money to chase scale without the capacity to deliver.\nBy late summer, some of Patel\u2019s investors and lenders joined the revolt. Last month\nThe Real Deal\nreported that unpaid debts and broken promises soured once-supportive financial backers. Some had put significant capital into Patel\u2019s ventures expecting reliable returns; instead, they ended up damaging a relationship with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and got left holding buildings that were bleeding cash, with tenants unwilling to pay rent under unlivable conditions.\nWhether buyers step in with the capital and competence to stabilize the properties remains an open question. For lenders and investors, the cautionary tale is clear: chasing yield through lightly capitalized operators can backfire spectacularly.\n",

        "content": "A builder in Hinsdale will forge ahead with plans to demolish a 19th-century house over the objection of the village\u2019s Board of Trustees after the board voted this week to reject his demolition and construction application.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of\nhistoric preservation running up against the demands\nof luxury buyers in the high-end Chicago suburb, where preservationists have worked to keep historic and architecturally unique homes intact.\nThe house at 142 East First Street is alternatively called \u201cThe Hallmark House,\u201d because it was featured in Hallmark commercials in the 1970s, and the William Whitney House. It was built in 1869 and owned by William H. Whitney, an Illinois state representative who was responsible for Hinsdale\u2019s incorporation as a village in 1873.\nThe seven-member village board voted unanimously to deny the application to demolish the house and construct a new one on Tuesday. Hinsdale\u2019s historic preservation rules require homeowners to seek approval before tearing down or altering buildings in historic districts, but unless the property is designated as a landmark, its decisions are nonbinding. So the owner can continue with the development as long as it meets existing zoning rules.\nHinsdale\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission also unanimously rejected the application in an August meeting.\nRobert Cimala, president of Legacy Homes Cimala, which bought the property this year for $2.2 million, is planning a spec build on the site, intending to sell a new house in the $7 million range. The house was previously owned by the Grace Episcopal Church next door.\nCimala said he will continue with the demolition and construction plan, calling the Historic Preservation Commission\u2019s requests for remodeling the house unrealistic and criticizing the process required to begin construction.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way this is set up, all that they can do is advise.\u201d\nThe home planned for the lot will be 6,840 square-feet, while the existing house is less than 4,000 square-feet. The planned house will have a four-car garage and rise four-and-a-half feet higher than the existing structure.\n\nCimala said demolition will begin sometime in the next few weeks and he expects construction to be finished next fall.\nCimala said he looked into remodeling the house when he first inspected it, and an architect told him it was not feasible. To renovate the house would require essentially tearing it down and rebuilding it, and the cost to renovate was unreasonable, he said. Members of a design review team in April suggested including the house\u2019s Italianate architecture in the design of the new house, but Cimala said there wasn\u2019t a market for that style.\n\u201cWhat they wanted me to do was basically tear down the house and build another one exactly like it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I told them I wasn\u2019t going to do that. That\u2019s not the style of home people want nowadays.\u201d\nBruce George, an architect with Charles Vincent George Architects, who is designing the new home, detailed the house\u2019s structural problems during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He said he was involved in a remodeling of the house in 2005 through the church\u2019s maintenance committee. The church put $500,000 of work into the house, but he said a lot of things were left in poor shape because of the cost.\nThe house is part of the Robbins Park Historic District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nFearing the loss of historic properties, Hinsdale created a\nHistoric Overlay District in 2022\nthat gave tax incentives to owners of historically significant homes who improved them while preserving traditional architecture instead of demolishing them.\nThe program has seen success, with about 100 homeowners applying for tax incentives to renovate their historic homes, Hinsdale Trustee Alexis Braden said. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Mimi Collins\nbought and renovated a historic house\non South Park Avenue that she sold for $6 million last year.\nIn the North Shore\u2019s Glencoe, another luxury market with a history of teardowns, city officials are considering\nsimilar incentives to preserve historic buildings\n.\nSome preservation activists want Hinsdale to have more power to block demolitions of historic places, though. Landmark Illinois urged the village trustees to give the application process teeth and make it binding, in a letter read into the record on Tuesday by Trustee Luke Stifflear.\n\u201cHinsdale has seen an increase in approved demolitions over the past several years, endangering the character of the Robbins Park National Registered Historic District,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe Historic Preservation Commission of Hinsdale urgently needs to revisit the village regulations to make it more difficult for historic assets to be demolished.\u201d",

Rithm was founded under Fortress Investment Group in 2013.\nRithm bought Paramount for $1.6 billion,\naccording\nto the outlet. As of yesterday, Paramount had a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. Green Street analysts predict the deal could be about $2 billion.\nNew York-based\nParamount\nput San Francisco at the heart of its premium office portfolio two decades ago. But as the pandemic wrecked the office market in San Francisco, Paramount has struggled to maintain ownership of several properties.\nAt its peak before the pandemic, Paramount owned six properties in San Francisco spanning more than 4.3 million square feet,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Standard. Paramount owns more than a dozen office towers in New York and San Francisco, including One Market Plaza, One Front Street, and 300 Mission Street.\nMonths before the sale, Paramount had been working to improve its finances by selling off parts of its San Francisco portfolio.\n\nParamount sold a 25 percent equity interest in the 640,000-square-foot One Front Street office building in May. That deal was completed in exchange for $40.5 million of short-term, fixed-rate financing. At the time of the sale, the building was valued at $255 million \u2014 more than half the $521 million price Paramount paid for it in 2016.\nThat same month, Paramount sold the 770,000-square-foot Market Center office building to Flynn Properties, headed by local franchise operator Greg Flynn. The firm\npurchased\nthe remainder of Paramount\u2019s debt for $177 million, marking a 76 percent discount on the purchase price.\nLast year, Paramount agreed to pay its lenders $125 million in order to push the loan maturity on One Market Plaza, the largest of Paramount\u2019s San Francisco holdings, to 2028. At One Front Street and One Market Plaza, Paramount executives were in the process of adding amenities to keep tenants in its offices and attract new ones.\nGoogle, Visa and law firm Morgan Lewis are exiting One Market Plaza. Meanwhile, Paramount\u2019s 55 Second Street building is being marketed for sale by lenders.\nParamount\u2019s remaining San Francisco portfolio was approximately 75 percent leased at the end of the second quarter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the rate is far below the metro\u2019s average vacancy of roughly 17 percent and a sharp contrast to submarkets like East Austin, where nearly half of office space is available.\nThe pull is a mix of location, pricing and convenience, Aquila said. Rents and operating expenses are cheaper than downtown, parking is free and plentiful, and tenants can still\nreach\nthe city\u2019s core in minutes. The corridor feels like a tight micromarket, with no new construction in the pipeline, Aquila Principal Taylor McHargue told the outlet.\nThat swing is helped by displaced tenants. Last year the city bought One and Two Barton Skyway, removing nearly 400,000 square feet of office space from the market to consolidate Austin city departments. Companies like JE Dunn Construction, which will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot office at Terrace 6 next year, have pushed into the corridor\u2019s already limited 3.3 million-square-foot inventory.\n\nHPI Real Estate, which owns and occupies space at Barton Oaks Plaza II and III, has seen demand rise. Managing director Casey Casper told the outlet that companies weighing downtown often\nopt\nfor South MoPac instead, citing easier commutes for employees living south and west of the city. Executives who reside along the corridor also tilt decisions in its favor.\nThe relative affordability is another edge.\nDiscounted\nrents, lower expenses and no parking charges have made the corridor more competitive at a time when cost-conscious tenants are balking at downtown\u2019s 28 percent vacancy, McHargue said.\nThat demand is colliding with limited supply, creating one of the few Austin submarkets trending toward high occupancy. Available space totaled about 450,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter, including sublease offerings, Aquila reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A malicious email has turned into a nightmare for Milford Management\nMilford Management was allegedly duped into handing over\n$19 million\nto fraudsters in early July thanks to a spoofing email that purported to be from the Battery Park City Authority.\nNow the Board of Managers of the Liberty Terrace Condominiums filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court alleging that some of the money lost to the alleged fraud included over $1.3 million in board funds that were supposed to be used to pay government agencies\nThe board alleges Milford, Liberty Terrace\u2019s management company, collected funds from unit owners and tenants to pay Battery Park City Authority, a quasi-government agency. The money was intended to pay the board\u2019s ground rent, facilities fees and payments in lieu of taxes.\nBut Milford allegedly sent funds to the wrong bank account.\nSomeone posing as an employee of BPCA sent Milford an email to wire the funds to TD Bank instead of Bank of New York Mellon, the bank that handled the board\u2019s account.\nThe email came from an email address of @bpca-ny.com as opposed to @bcpa-ny.gov.\n\nThe board alleges Milford performed \u201cno diligence and slavishly obeyed the fraudster\u2019s new set of wire instructions, wiring away $1.3 million of the board\u2019s money to the cyber thieves without so much as a phone call confirmation from a known BPCA employee, email verification, or second thought,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe board\u2019s funds never arrived at BPCA, resulting in a default. When the agency flagged the unpaid debt days later, the board alleges in its lawsuit that Milford buried \u201cits head in the sand\u201d and neglected to inform the board about the issues.\nThe board says that Milford has neither reimbursed the funds nor settled the board\u2019s debts with BPCA. Residents now face unpaid bills with interest and penalties accruing, according to the lawsuit.\nThe board claims Milford failed to perform any internal or external cybersecurity audits or follow the recommendations of those audits.\n\u201cWith bank and wire fraud so prevalent, the Board reasonably expected Milford to maintain industry-standard safeguards to detect and prevent such schemes,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved. \u201cMilford\u2019s failure to do so caused our client significant harm \u2014 a failure we are determined to rectify.\u201d\nMilford Entities owns three buildings in Battery Park City and manages six other buildings, collecting fees from over 2,000 units.\nMilford did not return a request to comment.\n",

The property would include units on the second through 21st floors.\nThe project filing also reveals a plan for 9,100 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Residential amenities would include a party room, a gym, a spa, a sauna, a plunge pool, media rooms and coworking spaces.\nThe conversion is expected to carry a $41.7 million price tag. The architect of record is CetraRuddy Architecture.\n\u201cOur adaptive reuse project will serve as an important next chapter for a building the Rudin family developed more than 60 years ago, and add desperately needed new apartments to New York City\u2019s housing supply,\u201d a Rudin spokesperson told the Observer.\n\nThe conversion has been mooted at Rudin for years. As of early 2024, the 1963-built property had more than 100,000 square feet of available space and hasn\u2019t seen a lease signed in almost 24 months.\nThe firm\ndidn\u2019t immediately act\non its conversion plan because the project didn\u2019t pencil out, but the calculus changed with the City of Yes rezoning, which allowed for added floors.\nRudin is considering another conversion at 355 Lexington Avenue, where tenants have been put on alert for the possible loss of their offices. The Rudins also\nsold\n55 Broad Street to Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft Management for a residential conversion in July 2023.\nOver a year ago, the third generation of Rudins turned over day-to-day management of the company to Bill\u2019s kids, Samantha and Michael.

It\u2019s home to a Rolex store and Michael\u2019s Genuine, one of the Miami Design District\u2019s longest running restaurants, The deal is closing \u201cimminently,\u201d a source said.\nPonte Gadea is paying about $60 million above the previous sale price roughly a decade ago.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo is brokering the sale, which was first reported by\nBloomberg\n. Spies and Fasulo declined to comment.\nThe seller is a joint venture between Wiesbaden, Germany-based asset management firm Commerz Real AG, New York-based Tricap, led by David Edelstein, and New York-based RFR Holding, led by Aby Rosen. In 2015, the partnership acquired Atlas Plaza for $50 million, which includes the building immediately south at 135 and 137 Northeast 39th Street. Atlas Plaza was completed in 1969, and the adjacent building was built in 2015.\nSpokespersons for Commerz, Tricap and RFR declined to comment.\nMichael\u2019s Genuine, the flagship restaurant for chef Michael Schwartz, opened in Atlas Plaza in 2007. The plaza is fully leased, and other retail tenants include Longchamp and Oliver Peoples, an offering states.\n\nPonte Gadea bested offers from other potential buyers, including Tadashi Yanai, owner of Fast Retailing, the parent company for Uniqlo, sources said.\nThe partnership between Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, New York-based Brookfield Properties and Greenwich, Connecticut-based L Catterton that owns close to a half-million square feet of space in the Miami Design District also looked at Atlas Plaza, sources said. L Catterton is a subsidiary of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton.\nWith a net worth pegged at nearly $125 billion, according to\nForbes\n, Ortega is currently the third richest person in the world. Through Zara, the clothing chain he founded, Ortega built a global retail and real estate empire that includes iconic trophy properties across the world, including New York\u2019s Haughwout Building and the Post Building in London.\nIn recent years, Ortega\u2019s family office has been on a major South Florida shopping spree, dropping nine-figure sums for office, multifamily and industrial properties. Ponte Gadea is under contract to buy Sabadell Financial Center, a 30-story office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, for\n$275 million\n.\nIn June, Ponte Gadea dropped\n$165 million\nfor Veneto Las Olas, a 44-story apartment tower with 259 units in Fort Lauderdale.

        "content": "Calvin Harris\nis taking his former financial adviser to court over an alleged real estate development scheme gone awry.\nThe Scottish DJ and producer filed an arbitration demand in\nLos Angeles Superior Court\nclaiming adviser\nThomas St. John\n\u201csystematically\u201d usurped their business relationship meant to invest millions in a Hollywood real estate development known as CMNTY Culture Campus, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nCMNTY Culture Campus was floated as a 460,000-square-foot complex with recording studios, artists\u2019 lounges and office space. The project began seeking investment from entertainers and financiers in 2021.\nSt. John allegedly looked to Harris for help when the project needed funds in 2023, according to the Post. Harris, operating through an entity called Lewis LLC, provided a $10 million loan and a $12.5 million equity stake in Hollywood LLC, the business structure behind the project.\nThose documents were \u201cmaterially misleading\u201d and Harris \u2014 government name Adam Wiles \u2014 received \u201cno context or information whatsoever\u201d about where his money was actually going, according to the Post. Soon after Harris forked over the cash, Harris alleges $11.7 million was transferred to Dun &amp; Dun LLC, a managing entity controlled by St. John.\n\u201cMr. Wiles has not received a single penny in return for that investment, and, indeed, respondents have not even started developing or building the project,\u201d the filing says, according to the Post. Lawyers for Harris went on to describe the deal as \u201cat best, a complete boondoggle, and, at worst, a complete fraud\u201d and noted that Harris received \u201cscant (and sometimes contradictory) information\u201d when asking for updates about the project.\nHarris\u2019 legal team alleges that the $10 million loan was due to be repaid with interest by Jan. 31 of this year but remains outstanding nearly nine months later, according to the Post. In the meantime, an agreement Harris secured via arbitration prevents project funds from being dissipated while the court proceedings are ongoing.\n\nLast year, the project at 6767 West Sunset Boulevard shifted its focus to residential housing, with the planned development comprising two towers with 750 units, including 90 set aside for low-income residents. The property would also feature retail and creative spaces.\nIn response to the legal action, a lawyer for St. John said Harris \u201cactively pursued this development opportunity,\u201d attorney Sasha Frid\ntold\nVariety.\n\u201cUnhappy with the pace of the project, he chose to pursue private arbitration to assert his discontent,\u201d Frid said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that due to interest rates and other market factors real estate projects are taking longer to build. But the development is very much viable and expected to have a [more than] $900 million valuation when completed. Mr. St. John denies any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In addition to building kitchens and bathrooms, in order to get light inside the building, a developer would have to create large lightwells, which would present an impossibly high development cost, Erickson said.\nThe location at Fifth and Market Streets might also repel interested renters, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the greatest neighborhood in the world at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least\nsix restaurants\nand eight retailers have closed their doors at the mall in the past few months, including Sunglass Hut, a Razer electronics store, a Steve Madden store, and clothing stores Oak + Fort and\nZara\n.

They secured an additional $40 million mortgage from Peruvian firm Core Capital, led by CEO Luis Marcelo Indacochea, the release shows. Lotus Capital Partners arranged and structured the financing.\nC-PACE\nstands for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy. It is a financing tool that encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. Domus Brickell Center is being built to Florida Green Building Coalition standards, according to a press release.\n\nNorth Development\nlaunched sales for Domus Brickell Center\nlast year with Cervera Real Estate leading sales and condo prices starting at $500,000. Units in the planned tower will range from studios to two-bedrooms, the release shows. Amenities will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, coworking spaces, a lounge and a restaurant, according to the release.\nThe design team includes Miami-based Studio Mc+G Architecture, and interiors firm Urban Robot Associates. Dunin\u2019s Domus Management will handle the rental process for units.\nConstruction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2028, the release shows.\nWhen launching sales for the project, Dunin said he anticipated most of the buyers would come from Latin America. He was also angling the project as a more affordable alternative to more expensive branded projects in\nBrickell\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big appetite for this price point,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people have been priced out of the market in the Brickell area.\u201d\nOak Capital and Edifica have a stacked pipeline of projects planned in the neighborhood, which has emerged as the epicenter of Miami\u2019s luxury condo boom in recent years. Last year they proposed a 43-story, 832-key hotel called\nHouse of Wellness\n. Also last year, they landed\n$70 million in construction financing\nfor their 12-story, 172-unit\nDomus Brickell Park\n.

The law allows homeowners to build up to four homes on lots previously set aside for one.\nBass froze its use\nafter Gov. Gavin Newsom gave local leaders the greenlight to suspend the law in burn zones.\nSome residents in the wealthy enclave fear housing density would hurt the neighborhood vibe, cause too much traffic and possibly delay emergency services.\nBut in Altadena, which also has wealthy residents and a high cost of living, county officials are leaving the door open to housing density on single-family lots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone from the ability to rebuild,\u201d L.A.

Post fire, it\u2019s serving as a vehicle for rebuilding.\nLos Angeles County has received 26 applications seeking the density boost in the eight months since the fires, the outlet said. Before Bass brought the hammer down in the Palisades, seven such applications in that area had been submitted to the county.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Blackstone Group is threatening litigation against the owners of office floors above its Club Quarters hotel in a shared downtown Chicago tower should they proceed with a residential conversion.\nBlackstone, along with the lender foreclosing on the 429-key hotel at 105 West Adams Street, told city officials they\u2019ll sue if Primera Group moves forward with a $184 million office-to-residential conversion above the hotel, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The dispute surfaced at a Chicago City Hall hearing on whether to landmark the 41-story Art Deco tower, a key step in unlocking subsidies for the project to turn 29 floors of vacant Loop offices into apartments.\nThe hotel occupies floors three through 10. Blackstone and special servicer CWCapital Asset Management, argued an easement agreement bars either side from rezoning without consent. Their attorney warned landmarking and rezoning could \u201cinvite litigation\u201d that would stall the project further.\nA venture\nled\nby Gabriel Martinez\u2019s Chicago-based Primera Group and investor Marc Calabria bought floors 11 through 40 last year. The buyers paid $11 million, an anonymous source told the outlet. That would be $33 per square foot. They are seeking to\nturn\nthe office space into 400 apartments with the help of $68 million in TIF money through the LaSalle Street Reimagined program, which former Mayor Lori Lightfoot launched in 2022 to bring more foot traffic to the city\u2019s center post-pandemic.\nThe city tweaked its zoning rules in July to allow aldermen to back landmarked buildings for rezoning even if not all owners agree, a move Blackstone\u2019s lawyer blasted as designed to cut the hotel out. Primera\u2019s lawyers countered in a letter that the hotel owners had ample time to weigh in and have \u201crepeatedly failed to participate meaningfully.\u201d\n\nThe battle adds another layer of drama to one of the marquee projects in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s push to revive LaSalle Street Reimagined. Six conversions have been greenlit by his administration, totaling more than 1,800 units and $317 million in subsidies. The Clark Adams Building plan is among the largest.\nThat conversion was already facing a separate $15 million lawsuit from developers Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group, who claim Primera and Calabria stole their proposal. Celadon and Blackwood contend their\nproposal\nthat was short-listed in 2023 bears too much resemblance to the Primera and Calabria plans. That plan\ncalled\nfor 247 residential units and sought $60 million in tax increment financing.\nThe building was previously owned by a venture led by Chicago investor Musa Tadros, who defaulted on a $29 million loan used to refinance it in 2016.\nOriginally called the Bankers Building, the 1927 Burnham-designed tower has cycled through various uses. Landmarking would unlock $24 million in historic tax credits and help finance the conversion alongside developer equity and $77 million in debt.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It marks the second phase of Harper Court, the\nTrammell Crow\nand Beacon Capital\u2013led mixed-use development that debuted in 2013 with retail, offices and a Hyatt hotel. The building also houses the Southside STEM Station, which offers free science and tech programs for local educators, families and students.\nThe project adds value to the 53rd Street commercial corridor, where the Obama Foundation set up shop in 2016, and momentum to Hyde Park\u2019s broader shift from university enclave to mixed-use innovation district.

        "content": "Houston real estate investor and reality TV personality Washington Ho is in the middle of a messy courtroom fight with the former CEO of his brokerage, White House Global Properties.\nChristy Huckaby, who was hired in January 2024 to run the firm, sued last September alleging Ho, current CEO Angelica Smart and the company lured her with false promises, failed to pay her salary, withheld commissions and damaged her reputation, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. She\u2019s seeking between $250,000 and $1 million in damages.\nHuckaby claims she was promised $10,000 a month for six months but received only $21,500, and that Ho and Smart withheld $170,000 in sales commissions. She also alleges she lost out on a nearly $276,000 commission tied to a $4.6 million listing for ex-Houston Rockets star Steve Francis, which she says Ho and Smart improperly took over.\nBeyond the money, Huckaby accuses the pair of defamation, making inappropriate sexual comments and dangling the prospect of a reality TV role \u2014 a spinoff of Ho\u2019s HBO Max show\n\u201cHouse of Ho\u201d\n\u2014 that never materialized.\nHo and Smart countersued, denying her claims and accusing Huckaby of breach of fiduciary duty. Their filing alleges Huckaby crippled the brokerage by taking 20 agents with her when she left, including her 13-person real estate team The Closers \u2014 Ho brought on her team along with the CEO hire \u2014 and by shutting down the firm\u2019s website. They also claim Huckaby attempted to blackmail them for $500,000 with what they described as damaging personal material.\n\nThe fallout extends beyond the principals. Nicole Lopez, White House\u2019s former COO, followed Huckaby out the door just two months into the job. Court documents show Huckaby released Lopez from a noncompete, enabling her move to Huckaby\u2019s team. Lopez has since joined Corcoran Genesis and previously told the outlet she left White House due to a \u201cvery chaotic environment.\u201d\nNeither Huckaby nor her attorney responded to requests from the outlet for comment. Ho declined to comment.\nHo launched White House with Smart in late 2023 after leaving eXp Realty, a move\ndue\nin part to disagreements over its commission structure. Ho pitched the firm as a new kind of brokerage with fair commissions and a focus on investment. Instead, less than a year later, it became entangled in dueling lawsuits with its founding leadership. A motion for a jury trial is set for October, where both sides are seeking damages.\nEarlier this year, the firm expanded\nbeyond\nHouston with a\nforay\ninto Austin, and announced plans to hire 30 to 50 agents over the next few years. The brokerage tends toward luxury listings, but it intends to represent all sectors of the Austin market, including lower-cost residential, commercial, industrial and development properties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller was the estate of heiress and artist\nLisa de Kooning\n, daughter of Dutch abstract expressionistist Willem de Kooning. The buyer was\nHikari Home LLC\n.

Trauber had owned the pad since 2023, when he bought it for just over $4.6 million. The unit measures just under 2,200 square feet, pricing the latest sale at about $2,000 per square foot.

        "content": "And then there were six.\nTwo Manhattan casino proposals on Wednesday were eliminated from the state\u2019s casino licensing competition. Six others await votes that will determine if they compete in the final round.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees rejected\nSL Green Realty\nand\nSilverstein Properties\n\u2019 respective casino proposals, both with a vote of 4-2 against.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday, who was seated in the front row, did not sashay away before taking a parting shot.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said as the committee members exited the room.\n\u201cThe only one with courage to stand up was the governor and mayoral appointees, and everybody else runs and hides,\u201d he continued, referring to the sole yes votes.\n\u201cThe benefits you\u2019ve denied this community and this city and state, you have to live with that history forever,\u201d he said, before leaving.\nIt was a rare example of an emotional, in-the-moment reaction from a CEO whose statements usually get filtered through press relations. It is nice to have real-life humans react and comment on things! Sadly, I was turned down for a follow-up interview, but the casino team sent over a diplomatic statement lamenting all the benefits Times Square is losing without their casino.\nThis whole approval process is somewhat unusual. The state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is supposed to assess the casino proposals based on several specific metrics. But the committees tasked with culling the competition were given much broader criteria for considering whether these proposals should even be presented to the board.\nThe CACs were instructed to \u201cissue a finding either establishing public support approving or disapproving the application.\u201d But there doesn\u2019t seem to be a uniform metric for establishing support or lack thereof, aside from the two public hearings held by each CAC on the casino proposals.\nI asked Assembly member Tony Simone if there was a consistent way of measuring public sentiment around these proposals.\n\u201cWe clearly look at the folks, the families who live in the district first. And overwhelmingly they were opposed to having these casinos in the district,\u201d he said.\nThe members of these CACs, however, voted pretty much as expected, based on the elected officials who appointed them. Does this mean the fates of the proposals were set from the beginning of the CAC process? We may never know. Elected officials would of course say no.\n\u201cThis is not a decision I took lightly,\u201d Council member Erik Bottcher said in a statement, referring to his decision to instruct his appointees to vote against both proposals. \u201cAll economic development opportunities deserve strong consideration.\u201d\nMore than a year before the vote, Simone, whose appointee Matthew Tighe sat on both the SL Green and Silverstein CACs, had said he was \u201c\nphilosophically opposed\n\u201d to a casino on Manhattan\u2019s west side, though he was referring to Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards proposal. Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Sen. Liz Krueger, who both appointed Richard Gottfried to represent them on the Silverstein and SL Green proposals, respectively, were also vocal about their opposition to casinos in Manhattan.\nBottcher and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine opposed Related\u2019s casino plans, which the developer abandoned in May.\n\nAdding to the intrigue around this process: Silverstein Properties COO Dino Fusco said the CAC considering its application sent the casino team a last-minute (Tuesday night) request to add $1 billion worth of housing to their proposal. Unsurprisingly, Silverstein didn\u2019t agree to that \u2014 such a promise would have been dubious given the lack of time to figure out where this housing would go and how the firm would pay for it. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development apparently is responsible for this request, hoping that the CAC would delay the vote and give Silverstein more time to consider it, according to a source familiar with the talks. Simone indicated that such a promise likely wouldn\u2019t have swayed the CAC anyway.\nSome of the remaining proposals awaiting a CAC vote will need, to belabor the \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d references, to lip-sync for their lives. As today certainly proves, getting the necessary \u201cyes\u201d votes will be a challenge.\nLike the two rejected casinos, the remaining Manhattan proposal, pitched by Soloviev Group, is at the mercy of a CAC that includes members appointed by casino-naysayers. But when I spoke to Soloviev COO Michael Hershman last week, he said he was \u201cfeeling pretty positive\u201d about his team\u2019s chances. That vote is scheduled for Sept. 22, according to Hershman. The remaining votes have not yet been publicly announced.\n\u201cDespite the defeat today of two formidable applicants, we remain confident that one license should be awarded in Manhattan,\u201d Hershman said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAttracting more tourists than any other borough, the city should have a fully integrated resort that is fitting of its position as the global capital of the world.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat will become of the SL Green and Silverstein properties now that the companies\u2019 casino dreams have been dashed? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Continuum sold its development site at 970 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights for $54.3 million,\nmy colleague Elizabeth Cryan reports\n. The sale follows a tortuous rezoning fight over the site.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander\u2019s cross endorsement during the mayoral primary was seen as a \u201cprogressive bromance\u201d, but behind the scenes, cracks are allegedly forming,\nGothamist\nreports. Lander had been signalling that he expected a top role in a potential Mamdani administration, but Mamdani shut down the speculation, telling Lander he had not yet made any personnel decisions.\n\u2014\u00a0A new City Council bill would ban fluoride in NYC\u2019s drinking water, a position aligned with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, according to\nCity and State\n. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Council member Jim Gennaro, said that while he\u2019s friends with RFK Jr., he did not suggest introducing the legislation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$8.2 million\nfor a 3,038-square-foot townhouse at 262 West 12th Street in the West Village.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.6 million\nfor a portfolio of nine apartment buildings, including 632-644 Wales Avenue, 785-795 East 151st Street and 786-792 152nd Street in Woodstock. The portfolio included 209 residential units and is 163,428 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21 million\nfor a 4,183-square-foot condominium unit at 111 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Lenders are continuing their legal assault on Charles Cohen\u2019s properties, now in Westchester.\nCohen\u2019s office campus in White Plains was hit with a foreclosure case last month, with the lender demanding $66 million. The billionaire was named as a defendant in the suit because he signed a guaranty agreement connected to the loan.\nCohen Brothers Realty Corp. bought the property at 333 Westchester Avenue in 1998 for $25 million, according to contemporary reporting from\nthe New York Times\n. In 2004, an entity connected to the company took out $77 million in loans for the property.\nCohen served as a limited guarantor on the loan, pledging to cover some of the borrower\u2019s obligations in the event of fraud, environmental issues or other negative conduct.\nThe borrower defaulted on the loan by failing to make monthly payments in the summer and fall of 2024, failing to pay off the loan by its November maturity debt, and letting about $1.4 million in utilities debt accrue, according to the complaint. Two of the commercial condos in the complex are occupied and together pay a total of about $32,200 per month, the lender alleges.\nThe plaintiff argues in the complaint that Cohen is liable for any loan principal that remains unpaid after a potential sale of the property, although it does not reference any events triggering Cohen\u2019s guaranty.\nDavid L\u00f3pez, general counsel for Cohen Brothers Realty, said no events have triggered the guaranty and the foreclosure is related to a maturity default.\n\n\u201cWe are in dialogue with the lender and continue working with the lender to either refinance or restructure the loan,\u201d L\u00f3pez said via email. \u201cWe are optimistic that this will be worked out in due course.\u201d\nThe property was originally constructed as the headquarters for General Foods Corp., according to the Cohen Brothers\u2019 Realty website. The 39-acre office campus is a five-minute drive from the White Plains Metro North station and has a fitness center, basketball court, volleyball court, and free shuttle to the train, according to the website.\nIt\u2019s one of several suits Cohen and his company are dealing with. In July, a lender won a summary judgement on Cohen Brothers\u2019 750 Lexington Avenue, sending the building to foreclosure.\nLender Fortress Credit Corp. is also agitating to collect $187 million from Cohen personally after a court entered a judgement against him last year. The fight has pushed Cohen to try to sell his buildings. Last month he closed on the sale of 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado, resulting in a $30 million payment to Fortress, according to court documents.\nHe has also agreed to sell 3 East 54th Street for $188 million to an unnamed buyer, according to court documents.\nForbes has estimated Cohen\u2019s net worth at $1.6 billion, down from $3.7 billion at its peak.\n",

        "content": "District Brew Yards, the concept that gave multiple breweries a shared taproom and production facility, is headed for last call.\nOwner Steve Soble is prepared to close the Near West Side flagship at 417 North Ashland Avenue as well as a suburban outpost at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling. CBRE was tapped to market the 17,300-square-foot Chicago building and the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property, which carry asking prices of $4.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, CoStar\nreported\n. That\u2019s about $260 per square foot for the Chicago facility and $302 per square foot for the one in Wheeling.\nThe Chicago location, which opened in 2019, will stay open temporarily while CBRE fields offers. The Wheeling site, which debuted in 2022, will close Sept. 28. They are being pitched as turnkey opportunities for brewers or restaurateurs. However, the Ashland property, sitting near Fulton Market and the\nplanned\n$10 billion 1901 Project from the Bulls and Blackhawks owners, could be ripe for larger redevelopment.\nDistrict Brew Yards\u2019 exit is part of a broader shakeout in\ncraft beer\nnationally. For the first time since 2005, more breweries\nclosed\nthan\nopened\nin the U.S. last year, leaving 9,796 still operating, according to the Brewers Association. Chicago has seen its share of retrenchment: Metropolitan Brewing folded, Goose Island\nclosed\nits Clybourn brewpub in favor of an outpost at the Salt Shed, and Revolution Brewing consolidated into Avondale.\n\nSoble, 61, said after decades in food, beverage and brewing \u2014 including Burnt City Brewing, one of the four labels inside Brew Yards \u2014 he\u2019s ready to step aside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either time to dig in and alter the concept or let someone younger step in,\u201d Soble told the outlet. \u201cWe see the writing on the wall that it\u2019s going to be difficult to continue to do this.\u201d\nOther breweries sharing the facilities include Around the Bend, Twisted Hippo and Casa Humilde. The model was born out of Soble\u2019s observation that food halls like Revival in the Loop had traction, but few existed for craft beer.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s what Liv Development has planned for McKinney, the site of its next North Texas apartment project.\nThe Birmingham, Alabama-based developer estimates the 205-unit apartment complex, named Livano McKinney, will cost $40 million, or about $195,000 per unit, according to a state filing that is subject to change. The developer aims to start construction in December and complete the project at the end of July 2027.\nThe 302,000-square-foot development, at the intersection of Alma Rd and Silverado Trail, will feature apartments and townhomes surrounding a clubhouse.

Its population has increased almost 10 percent to 227,000 since 2020.\nMultifamily developers in North Texas have dramatically pulled back on apartment building since interest rates caused development costs to balloon, and a historic number of deliveries resulted in declining rental rates and occupancy levels\n\nDallas-Fort Worth rents decreased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nIndustry experts predict the slowdown in development will give the market some momentum and push rents into the black by the end of this year or next. Operators like Liv Development are planning to time project deliveries with that anticipated rent-rate upswing.\nRobb Crumpton founded Liv Development as Red Mountain Development in 2006. The company has three other Texas apartment buildings in its portfolio \u2014 Livano Kemah, at 800 FM 518 in Galveston County; Livano Pflugerville, at 3301 E. Pecan Street; and Livano Prosper, 400 West Fifth Street.\n",

        "content": "Moderno Development Group won site plan approval in Fort Lauderdale for ArtHaus, a 26-story apartment tower with 265 apartments, including 43 workforce housing units.\nMiami-based Moderno affiliates paid $6.7 million to assemble the six-parcel development site, about a block south of the New River and just west of the Brightline railroad track.\nThe 43 workforce housing units at ArtHaus would be reserved for tenants who collect up to 120 percent of the area median income in Broward County, or nearly $100,000. Area median income in Broward was $81,488 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Moderno affiliates assembled the ArtHaus development site at 500, 510, 512 and 514 Southwest Third Avenue and at 501 and 503 Southwest Second Avenue in\nFort Lauderdale,\naccording to property records. Moderno Development Group is led by Doron Broman, founder and CEO, and Eyal Sapir, partner and director of real estate development.\nDesigned by Dorsky + Yue Architecture, ArtHaus would have a seven-story podium parking garage with 315 spaces, and an eighth-floor amenity deck with a pool, lounge and co-working space. The mixed-use building also would have nearly 4,700 square feet of commercial space.\n\nArtHaus is smaller than an earlier version of a planned multifamily development, which had a different name,\n500 Art Lofts\n. In the spring of 2024, Moderno and another developer, Aventura-based 75Invest Group, were planning the development as a 27-story rental building with 290 apartments, including 71\nworkforce housing\nunits.\nThe developers also had previously planned to advance the larger version of the development under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which allows municipal administrative approval of a multifamily development without a city commission review, if the development includes workforce or affordable housing units with below-market rents.\nThe Fort Lauderdale City Commission voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the site plan for 26-story, 265-unit ArtHaus development.\nWhether 75Invest Group is developing ArtHaus together with Moderno Development Group is unclear. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\nModerno and Gaia Real Estate Holdings launched the first $150 million phase of a fund called\nMILAS\nto purchase and renovate or rebuild about 400 single-family homes and townhouses in Miami\u2019s urban core.\nThe firms plan to rent out the acquired properties for a monthly range of $4,000 to $7,000, focusing on areas with limited new supply. A second $150 million phase of the fund is planned for next year.",

Construction is expected to begin in the middle of next year and wrap in 2030.\nThe project is in the design phase, but is expected to carry a price tag of at least $1 billion. Depending on the finalized designs, the redevelopment could grow even more expensive.\n\u201cOur new regional headquarters in New York is a bold investment we are making in the Americas,\u201d Barclays executive Richard Haworth said in a memo to staff. Chief Executive Officer CS Venkatakrishnan added that the firm\u2019s \u201cpresence in New York and the Americas is critical to the bank\u2019s strategy as the investment bank delivers on its ambitions.\u201d\nBarclays plans to update its trading floors, as well as the technology used by the 12,000 staffers who work at the New York HQ, mostly in the investment bank division. The renovation will also bring various amenities online, though specifics weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nBarclays assumed control of the 1-million-square-foot, 32-story office tower after taking over Lehman Brothers\u2019 North American operations 17 years ago.\nBanks are leading the charge of revamping Manhattan\u2019s office environment. Citigroup completed what was then the largest private-sector single-occupant renovation in New York City\u2019s history in Tribeca in 2020.\nAnd employees recently began occupying JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n1,400-foot-tall behemoth\nat 270 Park Avenue, which is expected to ultimately house more than 14,000 employees.\nBanks aren\u2019t only about owning their spaces, either. In the spring, PNC Bank agreed to lease\n83,000 square feet\nat Sage Realty\u2019s 437 Madison Avenue in Midtown East.

        "content": "Eliazer Tauber had a no good, very bad summer.\nThe New York-based investor was recently hit with a second round of foreclosure filings against several multifamily properties he owns on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The new lawsuits bring the total number of Chicago real estate loan default complaints brought against him to 16 since June.\nThe filings come at a time when\nseveral other landlords\nacross Chicago\u2019s South and West side neighborhoods are facing foreclosures on multifamily properties that have been flipped multiple times in short succession.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the first nine foreclosures against Tauber\nearlier this summer\n. All of the properties involved were purchased for far more than appraised values set by property tax officials.\nAmong the latest batch of filings is a $1 million foreclosure of a 9-unit property at 1003 West 58th Street that sheds new light on Tauber\u2019s involvement with\nembattled attorney Mark Nussbaum\n.\nMap of Chicago Foreclosures against Eliazer Tauber\nNussbaum, who shut down his law firm in January, is under indictment in New York for grand larceny for allegedly bilking investors out of at least $15 million in escrow deposits. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nHe and Tauber secured a $1 million loan on the West 58th Street property even though it was worth just $400,000 three years ago and hasn\u2019t undergone any major renovations, permitting records show.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of how they did it:\nMarch 30, 2022:\nLakewood, New Jersey\n-based CMP Trading, which\nhas been involved with Nussbaum\non other transactions, bought the South Side property for $405,000. The 9-unit, 1920s-era brick apartment building is located in the Englewood neighborhood where mid-size multifamily sales rarely break $100,000 per unit and single family homes are listed for less than $200,000.\nApril 8, 2022:\nAbout a week after buying it, CMP sold the building to an LLC controlled by Ascher Berkowitz for $580,000. Berkowitz took out a 30-year, $430,000 mortgage from an entity called Commercial Lender LLC to fund the purchase.\nFebruary 27, 2023:\nSome portion of Berkowitz\u2019s LLC was transferred to a new owner for $375,000, though details are scant.\nFebruary 28, 2023:\nAn entity controlled by Nussbaum bought the West 58th Street property for $820,000 and took out a $565,000 mortgage against it from Accolend.\nAccolend is a Teaneck, New Jersey-based lender that has worked with Nussbaum on other Chicago deals and has sold some of its debt off to an affiliate of Athene Annuity and Life Company.\n\nApril 25, 2024:\nA Nussbaum-led entity took out a new $1.045 million loan on the property from Sharestates, a Great Neck, New York-based crowdfunding platform that Nussbaum has worked with in the past. Eli Tauber signed the mortgage documents.\nMay 8, 2024:\nNussbaum paid off the $565,000 Accolend loan, according to a publicly recorded mortgage release.\nSeptember 10, 2025:\nWilmington Trust, acting as a trustee of the $1 million loan originated by Sharestates, filed a foreclosure complaint, also listing Sharestates as a defendant. The filing states that the Nussbaum and Tauber entity has not made monthly payments since February.\nThe bigger picture\nThe 16 foreclosures filed against Tauber this summer all apply to properties he bought between February 2023 and May 2024, and total nearly $10 million in unpaid debts.\nBesides the West 58th Street building, the other properties facing foreclosure have only traded hands among the network of East Coast investors once. But all of them sold for prices well above their publicly appraised value.\nTauber and Nussbaum\u2019s deals raise questions about the purpose of the transactions and whether properties were sold in order to obtain larger loans without any money changing hands.\nTauber has signed multiple loans on behalf of Nussbaum\u2019s entities. He and his son Jacob Tauber have been Nussbaum\u2019s known deal partners on Chicago multifamily properties through a company called Straightline Management, according to people familiar with the investors.\nWhile Nussbaum has served real estate clients as a lawyer, he also became a fast-acting lender to help multifamily buyers show they had funds to close transactions.\nHe began buying Chicago apartment buildings that were in rough shape as a white knight, saving the previous owners from facing foreclosures or city building code violation cases.\n\u201cFor those properties in which he does hold some indirect interest, Mr. Nussbaum assumed control from prior, struggling owners and cured pre-existing violations,\u201d Nussbaum\u2019s attorney, Ethan Kobre of Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas, previously told TRD.\nBut investors following similar playbooks have recently\nfaced scrutiny\nand\neven federal investigations\n.\nFederal agencies have discovered a pervasive scheme where investors buy a property and quickly sell it to a straw buyer at a higher price. The inflated price allows the owners to obtain a bigger loan, often from Fannie or Freddie, than they otherwise would have received. The goal is to\nbuy real estate with no money down\n.\nSome conspirators, including Eli and Aron Puretz, Moshe Silber, Fred Schulman and Boruch Drillman, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. More indictments are expected to come. Many of the players at the center of the DOJ\u2019s investigation have ties to Lakewood, New Jersey.\nThe DOJ has not brought any criminal charges or allegations of wrongdoing against Nussbaum and there is no known investigation into Nussbaum\u2019s transactions in Chicago.",

Austin has 6.3 months inventory, and Travis County has 6.9, according to Unlock MLS.\nHowever, sales and volume are up in the city. Total dollar volume increased year over year to almost $700 million, a 4.3 percent bump.\nPending sales were also up year over year in the Austin metro in August for the fourth month in a row. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area closed out the month with 2,669 contracts pending, an 8.2 percent increase over last August.\n\u201cThat indicates that sustained buyer interest is out there, even as we head into the traditionally slower fall months,\u201d said Unlock MLS and Austin Board of Realtors president Brady Wuensch.\nBuyers are\ncanceling purchases\nat record rates, especially in Texas. As a result, it\u2019s worth wondering how many of the pending sales in Austin will finalize.\n\nOn the other hand, the effects of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday\ninterest rate cut\nare just as worthy of speculation.\n\u201cI think buyers and sellers have both recalibrated their expectations before waiting for the dramatic rate drops that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years,\u201d Wuensch said.\nAs one developer put it, the Austin area is \u201c\nright-sizing\n\u201d after a few years of seller dominance.

Schrager bought the five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath spread in 2014 for $4.9 million, surprising those who associated him more with raw concrete condos.\nBuilt in 1936, the 12-acre property comes with manicured lawns, stone walls, a storybook pool house and interiors refreshed with white walls and dark floors. The listing leans on Schrager\u2019s pedigree as much as the house\u2019s charms, noting a renovation the family undertook the year they moved in.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Sally Slater has the\nlisting\n, which works out to $1,990 per square foot.\nThe move continues a recent sell-off for Schrager, who turns 80 next year. He listed a $7.5 million Miami Beach condo in a hotel he co-developed with Marriott last year and ultimately\nsold it for $7 million\n. He is still shopping a Dumbo loft he bought for $4.26 million in 2017, asking $3.95 million after a price cut.\n\nThe hotelier stepped away from Marriott in 2023, offloading select personal holdings as he narrows his focus.\nFor now, that focus is the Public, Schrager\u2019s bid to deliver a unique vision of luxury. He\u2019s said he has no plans to retire and is spending his days on the hotel brand\u2019s expansion.\nThis summer, an entity tied to the hotel\nfiled a summons\nagainst Whole Foods, seeking to prevent its delivery trucks from parking \u201cin front or in the vicinity\u201d of the property at 215 Chrystie Street. Whole Foods previously\nsued the hotel\n, alleging the crowd for the trendy bar prevents overnight deliveries at its East Houston Street location by restricting access to its driveway and loading docks.\nSchrager and Steve Witkoff opened the 28-story building \u2014 including 11 luxury condos on top of the hotel \u2014 in 2017, but were forced to close it down after the onset of the pandemic. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2021, but by the following year, the developers had defaulted on their $189 million senior mortgage and faced a UCC foreclosure on their equity in the property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "More than 400 agents, brokers and clients gathered at Miami Beach real estate agent Darin Tansey\u2019s celebration of life on Wednesday morning, including Tansey\u2019s closest friends and industry colleagues.\nTansey, a top agent at Douglas Elliman with a huge reach,\ndied unexpectedly\nlast week of a heart attack at the age of 50. He mentored dozens of agents over his nearly 20-year career in Miami real estate, and worked on new developments that included the\nRitz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach\n, where he lived.\nTansey is survived by his brother Jerry Tansey and his family, as well as extended family who include his cousin Bryan Tansey. His cousin said he was heartened to see the \u201cturnout and the love\u201d at the celebration of life.\n\u201cWe did everything together, but I\u2019m learning now there\u2019s so much he did that I had no idea about,\u201d he said.\nTansey died of a heart attack, his cousin said. His funeral and burial will be in his hometown of Burlington, Iowa.\nJay Parker, CEO of\nDouglas Elliman\nFlorida; Michael Liebowitz, CEO of Douglas Elliman; Elliman agent Chris Wands; Tansey\u2019s associate, Lynna Weil; and others gave speeches about Tansey to a packed room at La Gorce Country Club in\nMiami Beach\n.\n\u201cThe fact there are so many people here to celebrate his life does not surprise me one bit at all. Darin brought people together and left an impression and an imprint on everyone and everywhere he went,\u201d Wands said. \u201cWhen I think about Darin, the first thing that comes to mind isn\u2019t just his success, his reputation or his color-coded suits in his closet, or the career he built. It\u2019s the way he changed lives, mine included.\u201d\n\nAmong those who attended were Compass agent Nancy Batchelor; Julian Johnston and Eloy Carmenate from the Corcoran Group; The Agency\u2019s Sharon Beck; and Elliman agents Michael and Jaimee Light, Marc Brandt, David Siddons and Dina Goldentayer.\nWeil, Tansey\u2019s executive assistant, joked that Tansey loved three things: \u201cwork, wine and beautiful women.\u201d\n\u201cDarin had this incredible ability to find your strength immediately. He didn\u2019t focus on what we lacked, he focused on what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cHe carried himself with poise, sophistication and honor, and he cheered for everyone\u2019s success as though his very own and in an industry where that is so rare.\u201d\nMany spoke about their close friendship with Tansey.\n\u201cDarin\u2019s legacy is us, his family, friends, colleagues, business associates and our dear Vino [Tansey\u2019s dog],\u201d Parker said. \u201cLet\u2019s show Darin that his impact was powerful enough to cause us all to give a little more, love a little more and do the right thing, even when the alternative path is easier. You will be missed more than I could ever have imagined.\u201d\nLiebowitz, who took over as president and CEO of the brokerage last year, said Tansey \u201ctruly lived every day in a way that he really enjoyed himself.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the way he ate, the way he worked out, the way he did business, and the way he treated people. I never really ran into a person that had a negative thing to say about Darin, and that\u2019s unusual,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cUsually when you\u2019re at a memorial service, there\u2019s something you want to joke around about that you could say that\u2019s negative. I can\u2019t come up with one.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The cost of a U.S. Department Veterans Affairs project in Palo Alto has ballooned out of control.\nThe redevelopment of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, originally slated as a $450.3 million endeavor, could now cost the federal government $1.6 billion, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The department has been trying to renovate the complex for two decades.\nThe plan first called for demolishing six buildings at 3801 Miranda Avenue to make way for two buildings spanning more than 379,000 square feet as well as a parking garage. As time went on, the VA expanded the planned use of the development to include intensive rehabilitation care and an ambulatory care center. Those units meant more buildings added to the site, and as a result, more expenses.\nOriginally slated for completion in 2015, the languishing project is now expected to finish in 2036. It\u2019s about $1.2 billion over budget, with an estimated $74 million added to the costs every year that the project goes unfinished.\n\u201cBecause the Palo Alto project was never effectively governed, the costs and scope of the project grew out of control,\u201d Larry Reinkemeyer, the VA\u2019s assistant inspector general for audits and evaluations, wrote in a report cited by the outlet.\n\nThe office claimed that budgets and schedules were not fully analyzed and work requirements were tweaked without proper approval.\nTalks of redevelopment started in 2007 when a regional branch of the Veterans Integrated Service Network requested that Palo Alto receive a new ambulatory care center. Some buildings at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center were in need of renovation, but the addition of the 325,000-square-foot ambulatory care center project required the VA to do major construction at the site.\nCongress approved the VA\u2019s initial request for $450 million for the construction project in 2009. The VA approved a request for an additional $266 million in 2011, though most of that tranche hasn\u2019t been appropriated. Last year, the VA made its biggest request for a $907.8 million budget increase.\nAs of 2019, the VA had completed 10 phases of the project, including an intensive care unit and mental health center. The ambulatory care center has yet to be built. By February of this year, nine of the 12 buildings that were slated for demolition were still standing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The joint venture paid $21 million for the 18.4 acre site in 2020.\nRoyal Palm Doral has two tenants, Kope Logistics and Zoghbi Perfumes, and has 164,247 square feet available for lease, according to an online listing.\n\nTerreno\nis very active in the Doral industrial submarket. In July, the firm sold six industrial buildings in Doral for\n$82 million\nto Boston-based Longpoint. Seven months earlier, in December, Terreno dropped\n$195.6 million\nfor three warehouses on 23.4 acres in Doral.\nLink and Blackstone, which recently bought the East Miami hotel in Brickell for nearly\n$300 million\n, have been selling industrial properties in South Florida at a steady clip since November. With the sale of Royal Palm Doral, the Link-Blackstone industrial sell-off has hit more than $1.1 billion in combined sales.\nIn June, the two firms sold a 43.7-acre industrial development site in Opa-Locka for\n$105.7 million\nto Boston-based TA Realty. In December, the same buyer acquired an industrial complex adjacent to the development site for\n$160 million\nfrom Link and Blackstone.\nThe selling spree kicked off with the November sale of a 26-industrial property portfolio spanning Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties for\n$331.3 million\nto Longpoint. A month later, Link and Blackstone sold a five-building portfolio in Sunrise for\n$205.5 million\nto Miami-based Elion Partners.

A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels would\u2019ve had space for 581 cars.

        "content": "Speculation arose about the next chapter for Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotel Chicago after its purchase earlier this summer by a firm known for timeshare conversions. Now we know the downtown property will be converted into a Sports Illustrated\u2013branded resort under a plan from Travel + Leisure, which is betting that timeshares can work in the Loop.\nThe Orlando-based vacation ownership giant said this week it will launch a 250-unit Sports Illustrated Resorts location in Chicago late next year, joining forthcoming sites in Nashville and Tuscaloosa, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The company didn\u2019t name the property, but people familiar with the deal told the outlet it will take over the 26-story Virgin Hotel at 203 North Wabash Avenue.\nThe world\u2019s first Virgin Hotel\nsold\nin June for $77.4 million to Michigan-based Accelerated Assets, a firm that specializes in converting hotels and apartments into timeshares. That\u2019s $309,600 per key. The seller was a joint venture between Miami\u2019s Lionstone Development and Virgin Hotels, which spent over $117 million \u2014 or $468,000 per key \u2014 to redevelop the landmark Old Dearborn Bank Building a decade ago. In 2020, Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotels Group and Lionstone Development\nlanded\na $37 million refinance on the hotel through Prime Finance, retiring an HSBC loan.\nTravel + Leisure said the project will involve converting an existing hotel and offering \u201cflexible, points-based ownership options,\u201d with sales to begin early next year. Construction is expected to wrap in late 2026, though the\nhotel\nwill remain open during the renovations.\nThe\nproperty\nrepresents a rare foray into urban timeshares. Those models are typically concentrated in resort destinations, though a handful operate in markets like New York City. The Chicago version will feature a redesigned lobby with sports-inspired d\u00e9cor, a street-level coffee shop, a restaurant and a sports bar, according to Travel + Leisure.\n\nThe plan ties together several players in the evolving hospitality niche. Sports Illustrated Resorts, launched in 2023 through a partnership with Sports Hospitality Ventures, licenses its brand from Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine\u2019s intellectual property. Accelerated Assets has a history in Chicago, teaming with Bluegreen Vacations to convert the Hotel Blake at 500 South Dearborn Street into timeshares in 2013.\nThe Virgin deal was on the higher end of where Chicago hotels trade. Accelerated\u2019s buy was among the priciest per-room sales since before the pandemic, possibly signaling the property would not continue as a traditional hotel. The 1928 building sits steps from Michigan Avenue and the Riverwalk. It was designed by Rapp &amp; Rapp in 1928 and landmarked in 2003.\nThe building\u2019s tax status offers another wrinkle: it\u2019s under a Class L landmark incentive, meaning it received discounted assessments for refurbishing a city landmark and will graduate back up to the standard 25 percent of value through 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The updated plans still need approval by the West Palm Beach City Commission.\nThe new site plan calls for 20,691 square feet of office space, 37,445 square feet of retail, 14,376 square feet of restaurants, 12,750 square feet of crew amenities and 3,355 square feet of marine storage.\nThe plan limits the total number of residential units allowed to 1,059. Of that allotment, Related Group\u2019s\nIcon Marina Village\nalready accounts for 399 apartments. For the remaining allowed 660 units, Huizenga and Integra are planning four waterfront condominium towers, the highest of which will be 445 feet tall. So far, the developers are only seeking approval on plans for two of the towers, totaling 259 units. One is slated to span 34 stories with 147 units, and the other 36 stories with 112 units, a spokesperson for the developers confirmed.\nThe updated site plan also adds 60,937 square feet for a private or semi-private club, which will be aimed at residents of the planned condominiums and will allow for 250 non-resident memberships, planning documents show.\nThe addition of the private club comes as\ndemand for members\u2019 clubs has surged\nin Palm Beach County, with limited availability creating yearslong waits.\n\nThe Rybovich Marina redevelopment has been in the works for more than a decade, and was first approved in 2014. The city created the Marina Commercial Marine Planned Development (CMPD), allowing for 1,059 residential units, 35,000 square feet of offices, 10,000 square feet of retail, 15,000 square feet of restaurants, 45,000 square feet of marine industrial space and 10,000 square feet of crew amenities, planning documents show.\nThe site is rare for both its size and its water frontage, in a city where developers are racing to snap up the last buildable properties along the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a 19-acre private property with waterfront that you see here today,\u201d said Brian Seymour, an attorney for the developers.\nHuizenga Holdings is led by H. Wayne Huizenga, Jr., the son of late billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga who is best known for building up companies like Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, Extended Stay America and AutoNation. The Huizengas are the longtime owners of the Rybovich Marina site, and also have an ownership stake in Safe Harbor.\nH. Wayne Huizenga, Jr. and his wife own the nearby waterfront house at 3100 North Flagler Drive, which they bought for $5 million in 2018. Property records show the county estimates its market value at $26.6 million.\nIntegra is led by Paulo Tavares de Melo, Nelson Stabile and Victor Ballestas. The Huizengas and Integra tapped architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, known for its role in Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nmegaproject in New York City, to design the marina district.\nThe planned Rybovich Marina condos are among the\nmore than 2,000 units planned for West Palm Beach\n. Since the 2014 approval, the pandemic triggered a dramatic wealth migration to Palm Beach County, transforming the region and its real estate market.",

The publicly traded real estate investment trust\nrecently sold\na Santa Monica office building for $40 million, and hinted that it may sell another, seeking a similar price, next year.

        "content": "The California legislature\u2019s\npassage of Senate Bill 79\ndidn\u2019t come without a few modifications, including a carveout that excludes one county.\nContra Costa County in the Bay Area wouldn\u2019t be required to upzone areas surrounding transit hubs for higher density under the proposed law, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe bill, originally proposed by state Sen. Scott Wiener in 2018, allows the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops, and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the zoning regulations.\nWhile working its way through the legislature, the bill was amended to only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops. That left just seven counties in the state to deal with it: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. Once Orange County\u2019s streetcar project is completed next year, it will also be subject to the bill\u2019s application.\nBy changing the bill\u2019s language defining which stations count toward that 15-station threshold, Contra Costa County escaped any\nSB 79-related upzoning\n. The county has 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations, in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\n\nThe Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\npleaded with state lawmakers\nto push the amendment through. Their argument was that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\nThe final version of the bill upheld Wiener\u2019s vision, while also \u201crespecting the distinct needs of each community,\u201d said state Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Farias, who represents northern Contra Costa County.\nOther amendments to the bill include stopping developers from using SB 79 to advance a project that would demolish more than two rent-controlled apartments, which prevents most multifamily buildings built before 2014 from being redeveloped through the law, allowing cities to exempt certain areas defined as \u201clow-resource\u201d by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee if they also plan for density in other parts of the city, and giving cities permission draft alternative zoning plans within transit areas next year, though they must preserve at least half the density the proposed law calls for.\nSB 79 heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In other words, a Mamdani administration that won\u2019t be stacked solely with members of the Democratic Socialists of America.\nWhelan said whoever becomes mayor, \u201cit\u2019s in all our interests that he succeeds.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking to work closely with Mayor Mamdani if he is the winner on November 4,\u201d he said.\nMamdani\u2019s opponents have repeatedly criticized his lack of previous experience (he has been a state Assembly member, representing the 36th District in Queens, since 2021). Critics and supporters alike will be watching who joins his administration closely.\nMamdani has been tight-lipped about potential administration hires. In fact, reported overtures by Comptroller Brad Lander to become the first deputy mayor have allegedly caused tension between the two,\nGothamist reported\n.\n\nThe remarks come after months of some in the industry flip-flopping on their support of candidates vying to beat Mamdani\nReal estate executives poured millions of dollars into backing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign ahead of the June primary. Some shifted their allegiance to Mayor Eric Adams after his loss, but support fizzled alongside the mayor\u2019s poor polling numbers.\nOthers, however, including some affordable housing developers, have been\nvocal\nabout trying to work with Mamdani as the presumed next mayor.\nStill, a number of industry players have\ndonated\ntens of thousands of dollars to various anti-Mamdani political action committees. Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau reportedly organized a meeting of business leaders this month to\nstrategize\nCuomo\u2019s potential path to victory.\nWhelan and REBNY chair Jed Walentas met with Mamdani last month,\nas The Real Deal previously reported\n. Whelan described Mamdani as a \u201cgood listener\u201d and said they discussed topics where they agree (the need for upzonings, increasing housing vouchers, fully staffing the city\u2019s housing agencies), points where they might agree (how to ramp up housing production) and areas where they disagree (Mamdani\u2019s proposal to freeze rents for stabilized apartments).\nDuring Thursday\u2019s event, Whelan also highlighted some of the trade group\u2019s legislative priorities next year. For example, he believes \u201cthe idea of increasing taxes is going to be a robust conversation in Albany next year,\u201d an effort that REBNY will oppose. He also expressed hope that lawmakers will eventually change the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions law, Local Law 97, to help property owners comply. He additionally floated extending the office-to-residential conversions tax exemption, 467m, and increasing the value of the incentive for projects outside of Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "The Caltagirone brothers\u2019 Calta Group scored approval for a 499-unit Live Local Act tower in Allapattah, marking one of the first Miami projects under the state law with both condos and apartments.\nCoral Gables-based Calta plans the 30-story Anatomia with 6,500 square feet of retail at 1415\u20131469 Northwest 13th Terrace in Miami, according to the developer\u2019s news release. At its Wednesday meeting, the City of Miami Urban Development Review Board approved the project.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Anatomia will consist of 289 luxury condos and 210 apartments, the release says.\nThe Live Local Act, which Florida lawmakers approved in 2023 and tweaked in the following two years, awards developers with density and height bonuses in exchange for including apartments at below-market rate rents in their projects. Under the law, at least 40 percent of units have to be designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nWhile the law allows for projects to include condos, the workforce and affordable units have to be apartments.\nAt Anatomia, all residents will share a lobby and access to the primary amenity deck, the release says.\nThe tower also will have a rooftop lounge for condo owners and members.\n\nOf the 210 apartments, 128 will be studios and 82 will be one-bedroom units. The condos will range from studios averaging 419 square feet to three-bedroom units averaging 1,111 square feet, with asking prices from $500,000 to $950,000, according to the release.\nCalta bought the 1.1-acre, two-lot development site in two deals, paying $10 million in 2023 for one of the parcels, and $7.2 million last year for the other, records show.\nCalta, which Gaetano Caltagirone leads with Ignazio Caltagirone, has been ramping up its South Florida development activity in recent years. The brothers, who founded the firm in 2010, grew up in a real estate family in Italy, and started betting on South Florida\u2019s housing market during the Great Recession, renovating and flipping houses.\nIn Hollywood, Calta developed the eight-story, 180-unit\nRevv Hollywood\napartment building at 2233 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn Coral Gables, it plans the Via Veneto project with 10 three-story townhomes at 915 and 920 Palermo Avenue in Coral Gables. Calta launched sales last year, with asking prices at the time starting at\n$5.5 million\n.\nIn February, Calta scored a\n$53.7 million\nconstruction loan for the 151-unit Caltopia Hollywood apartment project at 2750 Van Buren Street, as well as the 100-unit Caltopia Hollywood II apartment project at 2217-2239 Jackson Street in Hollywood.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith proposals for large projects. The biggest known Live Local complex on tap in Miami-Dade County is Spanish developer Pablo Castro and his local partner Laura Tauber\u2019s\n4,032-unit\nHueHub in West Little River. The project will have seven 35-story apartment towers at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue.\nElsewhere, RCC Developers proposes a\n25-story, 300-unit\nLive Local tower on the northeast corner of Southwest 214th Street and U.S. 1/South Dixie Highway in Goulds. Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee\u2019s Shoma Group wants to build the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\nLive Local apartment building at 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street in Coral Gables.",

National Real Estate plans to construct a 41-story, 710-foot-tall tower above The Bloc\u2019s existing 12-level parking structure.\nThe development would add 466 studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments to the property. At the top will be a sculpted glass rooftop with an open-air amenity deck. A swimming pool, fitness center and lawn are planned for the roof of\nThe Bloc\n\u2019s garage.\n\nNational Real Estate will make a nearly $16.8-million public benefits payment in exchange for a transfer of development rights from the Los Angeles Convention Center property in order to accommodate the size of the proposed tower. Approximately $8.4 million of that will go toward amenities in the downtown area, including an affordable housing acquisition in Little Tokyo. Another $3 million will go toward street lighting repair in downtown and the general public benefit trust fund for Council District 14.\nEarlier this year, The Bloc lost its\nanchor tenant Macy\u2019s\n, though that space has been partially filled by a sports-oriented social club. The proposed residences would join other high-rises nearby, including\nMitsui Fudosan America\u2019s planned 50-story building\nat 754 South Hope Street and Brookfield\u2019s Beaudry development next to the Figat7th mall.\nConstruction on National Real Estate\u2019s residences above The Bloc is expected to take almost three years. A start date is anticipated for 2027 with an opening slated for 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Highbridge Equity Partners has fallen into default on three Oakland office buildings.\nAn affiliate of the Oakland-based firm was served a notice of default for a loan tied to the Tribune Tower at 403 13th Street as well as 405 14th Street and 1500 Broadway, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It could signal that a foreclosure process might be imminent, though Highbridge could still pursue a refinancing deal or loan modification, or sell the properties outright to offload the loan.\nHighbridge bought the three office properties between 2016 and 2019 for a total of $119.6 million, according to the Business Times. \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d producer Thom Beers and music producer Dr. Luke are among the firm\u2019s backers.\nRialto provided a $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and fund future renovations and improvements for the three properties. The following year, Highbridge hammered out a forbearance deal with Rialto Capital Management after falling more than 30 days delinquent on its loan. At the time, Highbridge founder\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat the firm was no longer considered delinquent after that deal.\n\nAfter that, Highbridge reportedly made several late payments and delinquencies, according to the Business Times. The loan transferred to special servicing from August to October of 2024. As of this July, the\nRialto\nloan had an outstanding balance of $94.5 million.\nThe loan itself is still active, so its lender can still pursue foreclosure, refinancing or term modifications, per the Business Times.\nOakland\u2019s office market has struggled to regain occupancy in the years after the pandemic. In the city\u2019s central business district,\nvacancy\nsits at around 27 percent, while leasing activity dropped 30 percent last quarter, according to the Business Times. As of the end of last year, Highbridge\u2019s Oakland office portfolio had a combined occupancy of 34 percent; that includes 60 percent occupancy at the Tribune Tower, 25 percent at 1500 Broadway and 16 percent at 405 15th Street.\nThe slump has led to the sale of several office properties at steep discounts, including 180 Grand Avenue, 1950 Franklin Street, 1700 Broadway and 1440 Broadway. It remains to be seen if Highbridge opts to go the route of the 1515 Webster Street building, which it sold last year for $22.5 million after buying it in 2019 for nearly $19.3 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The home of America\u2019s biggest university restricted shared housing for decades, but with a new state law in effect, dense inventory in College Station is poised to grow.\nTexas A&amp;M University has the biggest student body in the country, aside from universities with online schools, with over 70,000 students on campus each fall. Before this month, it was illegal for five or more unrelated people to share a home or apartment in most of College Station. Only certain neighborhoods were allowed exceptions to the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule, a rare restriction that became especially tight in a city of young, single tenants living away from their families.\n\u201cOnly a handful of other cities in the state were using restrictive occupancy at a relationship level,\u201d property manager and developer Jeffrey Leatherwood said.\nStudents, real estate agents and developers, including Leatherwood, helped convince the Texas legislature to pass Senate Bill 1567, which was fine-tuned for College Station. The law forbids college towns with populations of less than 250,000 from enforcing resident limits based on age, occupation, familial status or relationship status.\n\u201cThe City of College Station was putting real estate people in a difficult situation, and SB 1567 made it a lot easier for us to conduct business,\u201d Leatherwood said.\nThe bill took effect Sept. 1, and it\u2019s not clear how long it will take the market to adjust. No permits for dense \u201cAg shack\u201d developments have been approved in formerly restricted neighborhoods yet.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be interesting to see is when that six-bedroom plan gets submitted to the city, in an area where they had been traditionally pushing back on those plans, if that\u2019s going to go through,\u201d developer Scott Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, recent student housing deals include a $30 million loan for Culver Investment Partners to acquire a condo property on Harvey Mitchell Parkway in a zone that did not have a shared housing exception, according to Traded.\n\nThe city is working to \u201cclean up the books\u201d and align with the law, said City Councilmember Bob Yancy, who criticized the law before it took effect.\nDevelopers expect College Station to forestall dense development by other means, just as other Texas cities have attempted to hinder\nYIMBY legislation\n. For example, in response to\nanother state law\nthat allows residential development in commercial areas without rezoning,\nArlington\nenacted requirements for parking space, balcony length and mandatory amenities, like swimming pools. Plano, Frisco and Irving have created\nsimilar requirements\n.\nThe city enforced the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule by citing homes with more than four cars parked out front. The city could try parking restrictions as a de facto cap on residents per unit, Hancock said.\nThe council will likely institute new parking rules, but they will aim to improve road safety rather than counter SB 1567, Yancy said.\n\u201cOur own housing policies were unnecessarily restrictive in housing starts,\u201d Yancy said, referring to ordinances besides the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule.\nThe city has a shortage of about 4,900 units, he said.\n\u201cApproximately 10 years ago, the city began enforcing more stringent building regulations and fees, and they had a significant impact on our housing market and, I believe, exacerbated the occupancy problems that we have had throughout the city,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Terrell isn\u2019t ready to greenlight one of the largest master-planned communities pitched in North Texas.\nCity council members postponed a vote on Terra Nova, a proposed 1,550-acre community from Plano-based Main Square Development this week, after a tense meeting where residents aired concerns about scale, infrastructure and whether the developer can deliver on promises. The council will revisit the plan in November, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project\ncalls\nfor 3,600 single-family homes, 1,200 multifamily units, 145 acres of parks and a 50-acre downtown-style district dubbed Terra Nova Village, all located mostly empty land bordered by Griffith Avenue, Poetry Road and County Road 245. Hugo Morales, Main Square\u2019s president, has pitched it as a community\ndesigned\nto elevate Terrell\u2019s appeal while integrating into the city\u2019s existing fabric.\nFor Morales, who founded Main Square last year after two decades with Kimley Horn, the project is a bet on both his startup firm and Terrell.\nBut skeptics aren\u2019t sold. Most respondents to a city survey were not in favor of the development. City Staff received two petitions with about 80 signatures not in favor.\nA resident who spoke at the meeting, Pamela Robertson, urged phased approvals rather than a blanket sign-off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first-time development for this developer,\u201d she said, warning against rubber-stamping a plan that could take up to two decades to build out. Her fear is that Terrell could end up replicating the rapid, infrastructure-straining growth of cities like Forney, Prosper and Princeton.\nThose examples loom large. Princeton, the fastest-growing city in the U.S. this year, recently slammed the brakes on residential permits through a temporary moratorium to buy time for roads and utilities to catch up.\nTerrell officials appeared mindful of that precedent. Chris Snapp, the city\u2019s development director, told council members that traffic impact studies will be updated at each stage of Terra Nova\u2019s 14-to-16-phase rollout to hold the developer accountable.\nMorales said the\nscale\nof Terra Nova would be a strength rather than a risk to Terrell\u2019s growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to create a good community when you have a larger area of land,\u201d he told the chamber, rather than piecemeal developments.\nThe project embodies some tension playing out across fast-growing Dallas suburbs as\nwell\nas in the urban core, between the need for housing and the capacity of local governments to manage rapid expansion.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "City Council members considering passing the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\nmight want to see how Chicago\u2019s version is working.\nThe answer, it seems, is not well. Two City Council members pulled their wards out of the law\u2019s coverage area. One told Crain\u2019s Chicago Business that the law is burdening apartment building sales with\nred tape\nfor the sake of tenants who are completely unprepared to buy their buildings.\nAlderman Felix Cardona Jr. commended the idea of the law, but said it doesn\u2019t even teach tenants how to get a mortgage, let alone manage a co-op or condo.\n\u201cThe success of this initiative heavily depends on the preparedness of prospective buyers, particularly tenants who may not have experience navigating the homebuying process,\u201d he said at a council meeting, according to Crain\u2019s.\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a\nmagazine story\n: \u201cThe backlash against the program follows landlord complaints that it kills deals to sell or refinance their buildings, and get title insurance, by delaying closings and injecting uncertainty into the process.\u201d\nStudies of such laws, often called the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, or TOPA, have found that they only work for tenants if the government also provides funding, in part to prepare tenants to become homeowners and collectively run an apartment building.\nThe HDFC co-op program might be New York\u2019s most successful effort of this sort, but it does not affect private building sales like TOPA and COPA would. And the opportunities to create HDFCs are now exceedingly rare.\nMost of the approximately 1,300 HDFCs were created decades ago from buildings acquired by the city through tax foreclosures, which don\u2019t happen anymore. (Lenders usually foreclose first, and the city now sells tax and water/sewer liens rather than become a landlord.) Tenants did not have to come up with down payments and mortgages because the city typically sold the building for what they were paying in rent.\nHDFCs, to be sure, have had their share of problems (33 in Manhattan made the \u201c\nworst landlords\n\u201d list in 2016), but guardrails have been put in place over the years to prevent mismanagement or exploitation of the buildings by shareholders. Hundreds of HDFCs have regulatory agreements with HPD, which contracts with nonprofits such as UHAB to provide oversight and technical assistance.\n\u201cFor the most part, HDFCs run well and people who live in HDFCs are honest,\u201d said UHAB\u2019s Oscar McDonald. \u201cIn a few buildings where there are bad actors, that is not an indictment of all HDFCs.\u201d\nHDFCs were fairly successful because the buildings were basically free. TOPA bills imagine tenants quickly organizing to buy valuable buildings, which they are typically not ready, willing or able to do.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI decided to look up the property records of 535 First Street, a 6,500-square-foot, renovated Park Slope limestone that just sold for\n$13.9 million\n, a\nneighborhood record for single-family homes\n.\nIt was the home of a childhood friend of mine, Nicky Gussoff. His parents, Bernard and Judith Gussoff, bought it in 1966 from Mary D. Tully. (The neighborhood had a lot of Irish in those days; my parents bought the Loughlin family\u2019s house two blocks away in 1967.)\nThe exact price the Gussoffs paid is not in city records, but their mortgage is. Tully, the seller, provided it to the buyers: $9,500. She gave the Gussoffs 15 years to pay it back, which they did in 1981. Their monthly payment began at $46.\n\nWhat has become of your childhood home? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Related Companies\ndenied\na\nDaily News report\nthat it was contemplating offering Mayor Eric Adams a job to stop him from campaigning for re-election. The firm said it has no intention of doing so. That makes sense, because a prosecutor might see it as bribery.\nOffering something of value to a public official to do something that would benefit the offerer is illegal. In this case, the benefit to a real estate firm would be a better chance for Andrew Cuomo to defeat Zohran Mamdani in the November election.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 An upcoming City Council vote will put member deference to the test. The Council will soon vote on whether to build a development for formerly incarcerated people on a Bronx hospital campus. But,\nGothamist\nreports, despite earlier support, Mayor Eric Adams has pulled away from the proposal amid opposition from local Council member Kristy Marmorato. Several other Council members, however, say they will still vote yes, meaning the project may still be greenlit.\n\u2014 Democratic officials were arrested in lower Manhattan on Thursday night after trying to gain access to an area containing ICE detainees, the New York Times\nreports\n. The 11 Democrats, including Comptroller Brad Lander, were trying to inspect the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, which has been subject to allegations of unsanitary conditions. When ICE denied the group entry, the officials reportedly sat on the floor, started chanting and unfurled a banner that said \u201cNYers against ICE.\u201d\n\u2014 New York State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs said he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani, citing disagreements over Israel and democratic socialism, per the\nNew York Times\n. Gov. Kathy Hochul publicly backed Mamdani earlier this week.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$13.9 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot at 535 First Street in Park Slope. Tim Malone of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.5 million\nfor a 6,865-square-foot apartment building at 280 West 11th Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$40 million\nfor a 12,400-square-foot house at 2 East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side. The property last traded for\n$19 million\nin 2023. Adam Modlin has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 87,279-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use project at 19 Clay Street in Greenpoint. Murat Mutlu of INOA Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Idan Shitrit of Investmates.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "The Laguna Beach oceanfront home of the late writer and director Stephen J. Cannell has sold for $20 million.\nThe Cannell family trust placed the home, at 2125 Ocean Way, on the market in July, nabbing precisely what it asked for at the time of the listing, which pencils out to $4,246 per square foot.\nA trust tied to Capital Group portfolio manager Barry Crosthwaite and Jennifer Crosthwaite are the buyers, according to the deed.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\u2019 Shauna Covington and Leita Covington were the listing agents, while Pacific Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Spencer Wall represented the buyer.\nThe deal is Laguna\u2019s second priciest, on-market trade this year, according to listing sites. Still, it doesn\u2019t topple the most expensive sale to date, which was the $22 million trade of\n32221 South Coast Highway\nin July. That gated, 3.7-acre property includes several parcels, three structures and private beach access.\nThe Ocean Way property was one of two residences, the other being in Pasadena, where Cannell spent his time until his death in 2010.\n\nProperty records show Cannell purchased the\nLaguna Beach\nhome in 1999 for $1,093 per square foot, or $5.2 million.\nThe property sits atop a bluff with unobstructed views of the ocean. The home has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms across 4,700 square feet. It\u2019s gated and set on a 10,000-square-foot lot.\nRecent upgrades include hardwood flooring, lighting and HVAC system.\nOne of two offices in the home was used by Cannell, whose prolific career spanned television and novels. Cannell is behind dozens of TV shows, including \u201cThe Rockford Files,\u201d \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cThe Commish.\u201d \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Drama Series category in 1978.\nHe became an independent producer with the start of Stephen J. Cannell Productions, which later became Cannell Entertainment.\nThere are also more than 15 novels Cannell authored, including a series involving a Los Angeles detective named Shane Scully.\n",

        "content": "The $252 million transformation of Vernon Hills\u2019 Hawthorn Mall is moving into its next act, after Village trustees approved a revised plan for Phase II of Hawthorn 2.0, clearing the way for construction to start next year.\nThe changes mark the third iteration of Phase II and reflect what Dallas-based Centennial Real Estate, one of the project\u2019s ownership partners, called a major improvement over the version\nsigned\noff in 2022, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. Tweaks include relocating and expanding the residential component to 288 apartments across two four-story buildings, up from 255 units.\nRetail will also get a bump to 37,300 square feet of ground-level space. The buildings will straddle a covered paseo, and the plan also includes a direct connection to the intersection of Route 21 and Townline Road.\nAlong with Centennial, the project partners include development and construction company Focus Development, real estate investment firm Affinius Capital and Atlanta-based developer Atlantic Residential.\nThe new scheme\nspares\nmuch more of the original 1970s-era mall. Earlier versions had called for\nremoving\nnearly a third of the remaining space, but the updated plan pares that demolition down to just 5,600 square feet \u2014 the former Barnes &amp; Noble box \u2014 while reworking the east and south facades into outward-facing retail lined by landscaped plazas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a substantially improved plan, layout and use of real estate,\u201d said Sam Whitebread, Centennial\u2019s vice president of development.\nThe apartments will build on The Domaine, the luxury rental complex delivered in Phase I that\u2019s now 95 percent leased. Fifty-eight of the units will be set aside for tenants earning 60 percent of area median income.\nThe village\u2019s sign-off required a special-use permit, subdivision plat and revised development agreement, but the approvals sailed through. The project team \u2014 Centennial, Focus, Atlantic Residential and Affinius Capital \u2014 expects to start construction next spring, with the first openings slated for late 2027.\nRather than\ngutting\nthe mall, the developers are betting on a mix of fresh housing, open-air retail and selective demolition to keep the property relevant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Mohamed Eldawy is pushing ahead with a $540 million project on Galveston\u2019s west end, betting big on the island\u2019s growth as a tourism and\nresidential\nhub.\nEldawy\u2019s Friendswood-based Royal Crown Enterprise is planning a 15-acre development called Sachs on the Seawall, slated for a site where Seawall Boulevard meets Termini-San Luis Pass Road. A preliminary zoning approval this week paved the way for two condo towers, a hotel and commercial space on the site, Chron\nreported\n.\nThe first phase calls for a 216-room Marriott Renaissance hotel, 150 condo units and 70,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space, according to project filings. Four acres would be dedicated to green space and a nature preserve. A second phase would add two apartment buildings with 236 units, including workforce housing and rentals for J-1 visa students tied to the University of Texas Medical Branch.\nEldawy told city officials the plan could generate 2,300 jobs across construction, hospitality and retail. He\u2019s also eyeing restaurant tenants, including a Floyds Cajun Seafood outpost and a franchise of La Madeleine that he plans to operate himself.\n\nThe project has already cleared one regulatory hurdle: FAA approval for towers up to 145 feet, or about 11 stories, given the site\u2019s proximity to Scholes International Airport. Even so, the airport has raised concerns about possible impacts on air traffic.\nThe design comes from Steven Biegel of Round Rock-based Place Designers, whose portfolio includes the nearby Diamond Beach and\nTiara on the Beach\ncondos, as well as\nprojects\nin Padre Island. Eldawy said the development is aimed at\nluring\nmore permanent and international residents to Galveston, alongside tourists.\nThe project now heads to Galveston City Council, and Eldawy hopes to start construction late next year and deliver the first phase by 2029. That timeline would make Sachs on the Seawall one of the island\u2019s most ambitious developments in decades, positioned across from the luxury Diamond Beach condos and next to the longtime Seahorse Grill. The 236-unit second phase could be completed by 2031, Biegel said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The single-family home has five bedrooms, a landscaped garden and multiple terraces. Compass\u2019\nTim Malone\nhad the listing. The townhouse last traded in 2017 for just under $6 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe West Village saw one of the top commercial transactions recorded in the city. Via an LLC,\nJanus Sendowski\npurchased an almost 26-foot-wide, six-story Federal townhome at\n280 West 11th Street\nfor $13.5 million. The sellers were software engineer\nDavid Shopsin\nand psychoanalyst\nSusannah Falk Lewis\n, who had owned the property since 1991. The nine-bedroom house was once a rental building but now sits vacant. It dates to 1818, when it was one of nine homes built for the clothing merchant Aaron Henry. The building has some 8,000 square feet of living space, along with eight wood-burning fireplaces and access to Bleecker Gardens, a private interior garden. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nDavid Kornmeier\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA one-story retail/office building and parking lot at\n913 East 108th Street\nin Canarsie sold for $11.4 million.

The buyers were two LLCs tied to\nAbraham Posner.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Flushing, a four-story office building at\n136-81 Roosevelt Avenue\nchanged hands for $10 million. The buyer was a company linked to\nDavid Sutton\n, and the seller was another company tied to\nJoseph Lo\nthat had taken over the property decades ago.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAt the Madison House in NoMad, which was developed by\nJD Carlisle Development\nand\nFosun International\n,\nSara, Sophia and Thea Do\nscooped up a nearly 3,400-square-foot sponsor unit for $11.4 million.

Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nJustin Tuinstra\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: James and Lindsay Shanahan\noffloaded a condo and a storage unit at\n91 Leonard Street\nin Tribeca for just under $5 million, its asking price. The purchasers were\nRandolph and Tabitha Hickman\n. The Shanahans had owned the unit since 2019, when they bought it for about $4.8 million.

The\nSegerstrom family\n\u2019s development is expected to bring in revenue to the city through taxes and a $9.3 million community benefit payment to the city, Bacerra said.\n\u201cThis project provides housing while also providing much-needed commercial spaces. Santa Ana cannot thrive or survive by only providing the housing for other city workers and other cities\u2019 economic engines,\u201d Bacerra said. \u201cPrevious city leaders did not cultivate this level of economic development. Instead, they chose to force higher sales tax on our residents.\u201d\nUnder the plan, 1,583 residential units, as well as restaurants, retail, offices, bikeways and acres of publicly accessible open space would be constructed at the South Coast Plaza site at 3333 Bristol Street.\n\nThe South Coast Plaza shopping center brings in more than $500,000 annually in tax revenue for the city, according to a city staff\nreport\n. The proposed Village project is estimated to bring in nearly $5.5 million each year in tax revenue. It\u2019s also projected to create around 9,000 jobs, 1,000 of which will be recurring.\nAging and underutilized malls in\nBrea\n, Westminster, Buena Park and Laguna Hills have similarly seen proposals to convert into a mix of retail and homes. Under the state\u2019s housing mandate, cities across Orange County must plan for more than 180,000 new homes by the end of the decade.\nOf those, approximately 40 percent must be designated for lower-income families, according to Voice of OC. Developers of the South Coast Plaza project will skirt that requirement by paying $7.1 million in fees to go toward building\naffordable housing\nelsewhere in Santa Ana.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A plan to rezone Broadway in Edgewater and Uptown is finally moving forward at Chicago City Hall \u2014 and neighborhood groups are waging all-out campaigns for and against it.\nThe monthslong delayed proposal \u2014 backed by aldermen Angela Clay, Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth and Matt Martin \u2014 would upzone Broadway from Montrose to Devon avenues, allowing denser residential projects and a wider range of commercial uses. The ordinances, introduced in April, have been repeatedly postponed amid fierce community debate but are now slated for an Oct. 14 zoning hearing, Block Club\nreported\n.\nThe area is the\ntarget\nof ongoing infrastructure improvements, particularly the $2.1 billion Red Line modernization, which is expected to be completed\nthis\nyear.\nCommunity shopping district zoning, proposed for the area between Devon and Foster Avenues, would prohibit bars and liquor stores but permit retail and restaurants. The initiative would upzone much of the corridor to neighborhood commercial designations and would pave a way for residential and retail buildings up to seven stories.\nOpposition has been loud in Edgewater, where neighbors pooled funds to hire an attorney and erected two billboards directing passersby to a campaign website, SaveEdgewater.org. Members of the group Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development argue the city\u2019s outreach has been inadequate and say rezoning would eliminate their chance to weigh in on projects case by case. John Holden, president of the Edgewater Historical Society, has been a leading opposition figure.\nSupporters, meanwhile, have mounted a digital push to lobby aldermen. They argue that loosening restrictions will bring housing, affordability and vibrancy to a corridor long dominated by low-rise strip malls.\n\nUnder the plan, most of Broadway in Uptown would shift to zoning that allows buildings up to 80 feet \u2014 generally five to seven stories \u2014 and permits uses from salons to dispensaries. To counter fears of drive-thrus and gas stations, the city says it will layer in a \u201cpedestrian street\u201d designation banning curb cuts and requiring buildings to front the sidewalk, effectively barring strip center development.\nIn\nEdgewater\n, Broadway would be rezoned primarily to allow 80-foot mixed-use buildings with retail below and housing above. A section between Balmoral and Foster would be zoned with a 70-foot cap, after feedback from neighbors concerned about block-scale development.\nMuch of Edgewater\u2019s stretch of Broadway is capped at 50 feet, or about four stories. Opponents argue that raising the ceiling to seven stories or more will flood the market with expensive units while delivering little in the way of affordability. Some are already preparing for a potential legal battle.\nIn Uptown, where\nsimilar\nzoning is already in place, pushback has been muted. Hundreds of apartments have risen along Broadway in recent years, fitting into the neighborhood\u2019s larger wave of redevelopment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two Houston investment firms have snapped up a fully-leased office building just south of Chinatown, banking on the staying power of one of the state\u2019s biggest employers.\nFuller Realty and ICP Funds acquired the 133,000-square-foot BlueCross BlueShield Building at 8101 West Sam Houston Parkway South from an affiliate of Denver-based Sagard Real Estate, JLL announced. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Harris Central Appraisal District valued the property at $14.7 million in January, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBlueCross BlueShield of Texas recently signed an 11-year lease for the entire two-story building, which will get a full interior renovation and expanded amenities under the insurer\u2019s tenancy. Developed in 1999, the property has housed a string of major corporate occupiers.\nJLL represented the seller, procured the buyers and arranged a five-year acquisition loan from a regional bank.\n\nJLL\u2019s Kevin McConn said in a statement that Houston ranked fourth nationally in office sales volume for the first half of this year, noting \u201ca generous amount of investor interest with each asset that hits the market.\u201d\nThe acquisition comes amid a surge of office leasing and trading activity on Houston\u2019s west side and in the Energy Corridor, where limited supply of high-quality product has pushed rents up nearly 20 percent in the past year, according to JLL. Since 2022, more than 10 million square feet has been leased in the area, bolstering landlord confidence even as\nsome legacy properties face distress\n.\nRecent trades include U.S. Property Management\u2019s purchase of a\nvacant Schlumberger building\n, at 4646 W. Sam Houston Parkway North in Wolff Companies\u2019 Westway Park, and Wu Properties\u2019 purchase of\nWoodlake Plaza\n, a 106,000-square-foot office building at 2600 S.

Formerly known as Banyan Bay Apartments, the property has been renamed Legacy at Coconut Creek, Vizzda states.\nLegacy partially financed the purchase with a $64.4 million loan from Truist Bank. The deal breaks down to $185,096 per apartment.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Chicago-based\nNuveen Real Estate\n, sold the complex for more than triple the previous sale price nearly three decades ago. In 1999, Nuveen paid $25 million for the 25.6-acre community, records show. The firm is the investment arm for New York-based Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA).\n\nBuilt in 1985, Legacy at Coconut Creek consists of 19 three-story buildings and four one-story buildings. The community has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 799 square feet to 1,220 square feet, with monthly rents at $1,750 to $2,400 a month, according to Apartments.com.\nNuveen, led by Mike Sales, is an active player in South Florida\u2019s multifamily market as a seller and a loan provider. Last month, the firm provided a\n$72 million\nloan to Atlanta-based Acre that refinanced previous debt secured by Adela at MiMo Bay, a five-story apartment building with 236 units in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside neighborhood.\nIn July, Nuveen sold a 358-unit apartment complex near Miami Lakes for\n$93.5 million.\nLegacy manages and operates more than 6,500 multifamily units, with an additional 3,400 units under development, according to the firm\u2019s website. In April, Legacy and CD Group sold a 50-acre development site near Florida City to Freehold Capital Management for\n$31.6 million\n. The joint venture previously planned to build 309 rental townhouses.",

She currently runs Blackstone Mortgage Trust, the firm\u2019s publicly traded commercial real estate lending arm, and co-leads its $77 billion debt business. Tim Johnson, Blackstone\u2019s global real estate debt chief, will step into her BXMT role.\nKeenan, who joined Blackstone in 2012 and was close with LePatner, called the appointment bittersweet.\n\u201cShe cared\ndeeply\nabout this business, and I\u2019m going to be doing my best to help honor her legacy,\u201d Keenan told the outlet.\nLaunched in 2017, BREIT quickly became Blackstone\u2019s largest fund, amassing assets such as data centers, e-commerce warehouses and housing during a period of rock-bottom rates. Rising interest rates and sagging property values spurred many investors to sell\nstarting\nin 2022, however, dragging performance. Over the past three years, BREIT returned just 1.7 percent annually, far below its 9.2 percent lifetime return.\nExecutives now argue the market is stabilizing. Decreasing construction costs have led to more limited supply, debt financing has loosened and cash flows are improving across asset classes. BREIT has logged eight straight months of gains and raised $1.1 billion in the second quarter \u2014 its strongest fundraising haul in more than two years \u2014 as withdrawal requests eased.\n\nNadeem Meghji, Blackstone\u2019s global real estate co-head, told the outlet that the fund functioned as designed through a volatile period, adding that Keenan is the right choice to guide the trust through its next growth phase.\nLePatner, 43, was fatally\nshot\nalong with three others when a gunman opened fire in Blackstone\u2019s Midtown lobby at 345 Park Avenue. Authorities said the attacker, who later took his own life, had targeted the NFL, another tenant in the building. LePatner also headed Blackstone\u2019s core-plus real estate business and joined Blackstone in 2014 following a decade in Goldman Sachs\u2019 real estate division.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

About 700 more townhouses and 500 more condos were for sale last month compared to a year prior, representing bumps of 30 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Listings for detached homes increased at 22 percent.\nAlthough conditions are increasingly favoring buyers, the median home price was flat in August for the first time in months at $340,000. Houston registered lowering prices from March to July. Nationally, the median home price rose by more than 2 percent year-over-year last month to $389,000, putting Houston well within reach of a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, said CoStar director of market analytics Itziar Aguirre.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate cut\nwill encourage more buyer interest, Aguirre said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing houses sit on the market longer. We\u2019re seeing prices go down, especially in the condo market. And, mortgage rates, while they\u2019re still high, they\u2019re actually at the lowest they\u2019ve been in about a year,\u201d Aguirre said.\nHouston\u2019s record-setting inventory follows years of breakneck building.
