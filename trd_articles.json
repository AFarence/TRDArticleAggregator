        "content": "A landlord battered by the pandemic-era collapse in tourism is scrambling to hang on to a boutique Nolita hotel as a long-running foreclosure inches forward.\nVeracity Equities, the lower Manhattan-focused firm run by Edmond Li, is facing a $35.3 million judgment tied to a defaulted mortgage at the Nolitan, a 55-key hotel at 153 Elizabeth Street. The nine-story building on the corner of Kenmare Street had been slated to go up for auction this week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nInstead, the auction has been pushed \u2014 again. Li and lender Silverpeak Real Estate Finance agreed Monday to delay the sale until Feb. 4, a move that appears aimed at buying the borrower more time to secure a refinancing and pay off the debt.\nThe delay marks the third time the court postponed an auction of the property, underscoring how messy and drawn-out pandemic-era hotel workouts can be.\nLi bought the Elizabeth Street site in 2006 for $5.4 million and redeveloped it into the Nolitan, which opened in 2011. Today, rooms start at around $300 a night. The property is also home to the Japanese-Italian restaurant Kimika on the ground floor.\nSilverpeak, a Midtown-based lender, issued a $24 million loan on the property in 2016 that was later securitized and sold to investors. After Covid shutdowns destroyed hotel revenue, Li stopped making payments in 2021, prompting the lender to launch foreclosure proceedings later that year, according to court records.\nLi has argued that the lender and a court-appointed receiver undercut his efforts to stabilize the asset, including blocking plans for a rooftop bar that could have generated roughly $68,000 a month in rent and preventing repairs to address water leaks.\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Francis Kahn ultimately sided with Silverpeak, ruling that Li remains liable for roughly $35 million, including principal, interest and fees.\nIf the foreclosure goes through, it would be the latest blow to Veracity\u2019s downtown portfolio.\nThe firm is also facing foreclosure on a $32 million loan tied to three nearby rental buildings at 137 Thompson Street and 26 and 29 Prince Street. Last year, Li sold a mixed-use walkup at 146 Mulberry Street for $12.7 million, below the $13.3 million he paid in 2015.\nSilverpeak\u2019s attorney declined to comment. Li and his counsel did not return calls.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The loan will help support the multifamily development, expected to wrap in the fall of 2027.\nAffinius Capital provided the loan for the 21-story, 276-unit project at the corner of Douglass and Bond streets. The development is expected to include 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.\nUnits in the building will range from studio to three-bedroom layouts.

Several months ago, it teamed up with 3650 Capital to\nprovide $156 million\nin debt to Prime Holdings Group, which refinanced a trio of self-storage properties in the outer boroughs.\nMidwood\u2019s portfolio spans more than 100 properties nationwide. Among its prominent New York developments are the Candela Tower in Manhattan, 800 Union Street in Brooklyn and The Williams, also in Brooklyn.\nDevelopers began flocking to Gowanus several years ago when the neighborhood was rezoned in 2021, a move expected to add more than 8,000 apartments to the area over the span of a decade.\nIn a statement, Usdan referred to Gowanus as \u201cone of Brooklyn\u2019s most dynamic and rapidly evolving neighborhoods.\u201d\nLast month, David Tabak\nacquired\na development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus for $58.5 million.

The parcel is owned by Del Mar Property, an entity managed by local developer Gerard Ngo.\nWhen complete, Prospect Villa will deliver 75 one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments atop roughly 6,350 square feet of ground-floor retail, \u201caddressing the housing needs of Rosemead\u201d while \u201ctransforming [the] underutilized site into a vibrant community hub,\u201d Wong said. The location is currently a vacant lot.\nThe financing arrives amid an uncertain capital markets environment as higher interest rates and elevated construction costs present obstacles to development. At the same time, developers and institutional investors have been\nturning their attention outside Los Angeles\ncity limits to communities like Rosemead to avoid hurdles like\nMeasure ULA\n. \u201cSecuring construction financing in today\u2019s capital markets requires a compelling sponsor and a project that truly fits the local demographic,\u201d Wong said.\nSite owner Ngo is no stranger to Rosemead, and this stretch of Garvey Avenue in particular. In 2023, Ngo, acting through his Green Park Property firm,\nfiled plans to build\n93 apartments with 5,400 square feet ground-floor retail and restaurants at 7849-7857 Garvey Avenue and 7900-7916 Virginia Street. The project would replace a row of small commercial buildings at Garvey and Del Mar avenues and boast one, two- and three-bedroom units.\nThe average rent in the San Gabriel Valley is $2,039 a month, well below the overall L.A. County average of $2,336, according to a third-quarter market report from Lee &amp; Associates cited by CO. Compared to a year ago, there are also more apartment buildings on the market as owners face strict rent control laws, rising cost of ownership and higher utility costs and insurance premiums.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital delivered.\nExtell Development landed $1.13 billion in construction financing for its 74-story project in Midtown Manhattan, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal, done without brokers, represents the largest construction financing package in New York City this year.\nThe financing closed on Monday. Tyko declined to comment to the Observer, while Extell did not return a request for comment.\nExtell in July filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning for the site, doubling the number of stories Barnett had in mind when the firm initially filed plans last fall.\nThe rezoning application described a 765,000-square-foot project that would stand 1,162 feet tall and include 154 residential units. The residential space would span 476,000 square feet, while 233,000 square feet of commercial space would be split between office and retail, mostly the former.\nBarnett offered to improve the Fifth Avenue/59th Street N/R/W subway station in exchange for 130,000 square feet of space. Extell also wants to transfer 135,000 square feet of development rights from the Metropolitan Club at 790 Fifth Avenue.\nWithout the rezoning, Extell was last considering a plan for an even taller, 84-story property, though it would have less residential and office space. That project would span 600,000 square feet with 158 residential units, which could be adjusted in either direction depending on unit size.\nThe estimated completion date would be in 2031.\nExtell bought the property between East 60th and East 61st streets last October for\nnearly $160 million\nfrom Williams Equities. The 24-story building was last renovated in 2005 and charged office rents between $54 and $66 per square foot, according to CoStar estimates.\nIn the spring, luxury fashion brand Chanel was reported to be\nin discussions\nto purchase the retail space at the development, potentially paying in the mid-$400 millions for the 65,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The developers of Miami Beach\u2019s Goodtime Hotel are in for a not-so-good time over a payment guarantee tied to an allegedly defaulted $149.3 million mortgage.\nEric Birnbaum and Michael Fascitelli allege CIM Group is seeking to illegally collect at least $10 million via the payment guarantee, even if they turn over the 266-key hotel at\n601 Washington Avenue\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. That\u2019s according to a counterclaim filed in New York Supreme Court this week against an affiliate of the Sacramento-based lender.\nIn July, the CIM affiliate sued Birnbaum and Fascitelli, who lead New York-based Imperial Companies, for allegedly breaching the payment guarantee by failing to make the $10 million payment and giving up the property, which is part of Marriott\u2019s Tribute Portfolio division.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges the Imperial Companies affiliate that owns Goodtime Hotel failed to repay roughly $149.3 million when the loan matured last year.\nAttorneys for Birnbaum, Fascitelli and CIM declined comment.\nGoodtime Hotel\nopened in 2021 with a lot of fanfare. At the time, Birnbaum and Fascitelli touted\u00a0 celebrity Pharrell Williams, hospitality mogul David Grutman and designer Ken Fulk as partners in the project. They developed the hotel with a\n$45 million\nconstruction loan after acquiring the property for\n$36 million\nin 2015.\nA lawyer\u2019s costly mistake\nAccording to court filings, Goodtime Hotel\u2019s owners signed the payment guarantee agreement in 2021, when they obtained a\n$164 million\nfinancing from CIM that was subsequently reduced to $152 million. Birnbaum and Fascitelli allege the agreement was supposed to state that they would pay for three months of carrying costs in the event the lender foreclosed on the property or the hotel owners relinquished the property in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut their lawyer, Gary Axelrod with Chicago-based law firm Lathan &amp; Watkins, allegedly missed an error in the agreement that did not explicitly state Birnbaum and Fascitelli would only cover costs for three months, the counterclaim states. As a result, their obligation for the hotel\u2019s operating costs, taxes and debt service could be interpreted as a potentially perpetual obligation until the Goodtime Hotel was in the black.\nAxelrod allegedly did not realize the mistake until 2023 when Birnbaum and Fascitelli initially decided to go ahead with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure because Goodtime Hotel was not profitable, the counterclaim states. The attorney allegedly advised the hotel owners to \u201ckick the can\u201d until the property was stabilized. Axelrod did not respond to requests for comment.\nBirnbaum\nand Fascitelli allege the CIM affiliate has sought to capitalize on the error by refusing to correct the agreement, asserting that the hotel owners could be liable in perpetuity. The lender allegedly leveraged the erroneous payment guarantee agreement to force Birnbaum and Fascitelli into forbearance in 2023 and a $10 million supplemental guarantee, per the counterclaim.\nThe alleged mortgage default\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli accuse the CIM affiliate of repeatedly stalling their efforts to do a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure deal and initiating a UCC foreclosure action that the lender did not follow through on. The CIM affiliate also allegedly torpedoed their attempts to refinance the mortgage debt with a new lender by increasing the payoff quote by more than $20 million, the counterclaim states.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges in its lawsuit that it sent the Goodtime Hotel entity a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure notice in January, but that the owners failed to deliver closing documents and fulfill other requirements for transferring the property. A month later, after demanding the $10 million payment, the lender provided Birnbaum and Fascitelli extensions to complete the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which they failed to meet.\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli are seeking a court order to rescind the payment guarantee agreement or allow it to be amended to include the three month requirement for the carrying costs.",

The facility sits on 24 acres and includes nearly 10,000 square feet of office space with 85 dock positions.\nBridge spent $91.6 million to redevelop the property, demolishing a majority of the former structure while maintaining its original brick facade to make way for a new industrial facility. The company broke ground on Bridge Point in 2020 to create \u201ca critical piece of infrastructure in a rapidly growing city and region that is in need of new industrial supply,\u201d Greg Woolway, a vice president at Bridge,\nsaid\nin a statement at the time. Bridge completed construction on Bridge Point Oakland in 2023.\nDemand for industrial space is on the rise, as leasing activity across the market increased 45 percent in the third quarter to 2.3 million square feet from 1.6 million square feet in the prior three months. The difference year-over-year was even more pronounced with a 97 percent jump. Of the deals signed, 74 percent were new leases. The vacancy rate for industrial space in the Bay Area was 6.4 percent in the third quarter, according to a CBRE\nreport\n,\ndown\nfrom 6.6 percent the prior quarter.\nBridge Industrial is\u00a0 building a 714,491-square-foot\nindustrial\ncampus at 2350 Qume Drive in San Jose, known as Bridge Point San Jose. That project is expected to be completed in March.\nThe company acquires, develops and operates logistics real estate in supply-constrained markets across the country and Europe, according to its website. Its only completed facility in the Bay Area at the moment is Bridge Point Silicon Valley, a 388,240-square-foot property in\nMilpitas\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Hours after publication of my\nAug. 11 article\nabout the substantial rehabilitation of a Williamsburg rental building, I got a frantic email from a reader.\nThe building had been taken out of rent stabilization following the sub rehab and had been charging market-rate rents \u2014 a perfectly legal strategy \u2014 only for a state regulator to retroactively deny the deregulation. This would devalue the building, for which the owner had paid Jeff Sutton $9.75 million in 2023, and likely trigger a rent-overcharge lawsuit.\nThis sequence of events would wipe out the investment and lead to foreclosure, with the lender selling the property for pennies on the dollar. A real estate disaster by any definition.\nBack to the reader\u2019s email. Without revealing his specific request, to which I did not agree, I will share my takeaway from the message: Lots of real estate investors have done this and could be royally screwed.\nIf the state\u2019s regulator of rent-stabilized housing, Homes and Community Renewal, starts systematically undoing deregulations of sub-rehabbed buildings, many owners and lenders would be crushed.\nThe reader who emailed me was a longtime owner of rental buildings and was not connected to the Williamsburg building, which led me to believe he knew what he was talking about.\nTurns out, he did. On Nov. 26, my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\ncovered a lawsuit\nby the owners of 31 sub-rehabbed buildings. They want the courts to protect these investments from getting hosed by HCR the way the Williamsburg building sold by Sutton did.\nThe lawsuit didn\u2019t specify the 31 buildings; the owners want to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. But that strategy appears to have failed: Days later Attorney General Letitia James sued Peak Capital Advisors for deregulating 159 units in\n31 buildings\nthrough sub rehabs.\nPeak hasn\u2019t acknowledged filing the November lawsuit, whose plaintiffs call themselves Balanced Housing Solutions, or BHS. (They should have picked a different name, because BHS to most real estate people means Brown Harris Stevens.) The plaintiffs say the attorney general\u2019s separate suit doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that HCR changed its policy on sub rehabs, thus unfairly portraying owners as lawbreakers.\nAt this point, only a fool would finance a sub rehab without getting a written guarantee from HCR that deregulation is allowed. But what about all the folks who have already done these projects with the assumption that the rules were the same as they had been for ages? How many hundreds of buildings are at risk?\nGiven HCR\u2019s history under Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas, the agency seems unlikely to give landlords the benefit of the doubt. Fortunately for owners, Visnauskas has a boss. Her name is Gov. Kathy Hochul. And she\u2019s up for re-election next year.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill owners of old apartment buildings replace gas stoves \u2014 which produce emissions that\ndamage tenants\u2019 lungs\nand also pose a fire risk \u2014 with 120-volt, battery-powered electric appliances? Because they store energy, they don\u2019t draw a lot of power at once and thus don\u2019t require electrical system upgrades. But they can still cook two Thanksgiving dinners on a single charge. Electra brags that its 120-volt induction stove costs only $3,999, versus\nCopper\u2019s $5,999 model\n. Send thoughts to eengquist@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Having employees with political differences work together might be a bad idea, based on a study of golfers. An\nanalysis\nof PGA players\u2019 results from 1997 to 2022 found that when golfers in a group were all Republicans or all Democrats, they played better. Golfers in politically mixed groups took 0.2 more strokes, on average, to finish a round. PGA group assignments are random, allowing for what economists call a natural experiment.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGood news for real estate interests who thought they were stuck with HSTPA apologist Linda Rosenthal as chair of the Assembly Housing Committee for the rest of her career: She is considering jumping to the state Senate.\nAccording to\nCity and State\n, the seat being vacated mid-term by Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal is Rosenthal\u2019s if she wants it. She wouldn\u2019t even have to win a competitive race, because in a special election such as this one, Democratic insiders can name the party\u2019s candidate.\n\u201cRosenthal has privately thought about what to do for months, but she still has not come to a decision on whether she\u2019d like to run, or stick with the Assembly, where she has worked her way up over two decades to become chair of the powerful Housing Committee,\u201d the publication wrote.\nThe Senate, which has 63 seats, is more prestigious than the Assembly, which has 150. But Rosenthal would have less say over rent stabilization, and her successor as Assembly housing chair might be more receptive to changing the HSTPA before it bankrupts and degrades more buildings.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$20.7 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot condominium unit at 535 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side. Steven A Cohen with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$218.6 million\nfor the InterContinental New York Times Square at 300 West 44th Street. Tishman Realty sold the 670-room hotel to\nGencom, Highgate and Argent Ventures\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$4.8 million\nfor a 2,006-square-foot condominium unit at 250 West 96th Street on the Upper West Side. Pamela S. D\u2019Arc with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nTwo permits for a combined 400 units and 386,000 square feet were filed at 161-09 and 161-10 Hillside Avenue in Jamaica Hills. Matthew Melody with Curtis + Ginsberg Architects filed the permits on behalf of Mural Real Estate Partners.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Weirtheim\u2019s purchase was the first home sale in Manalapan to trade above $60 million since Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison\u2019s\n$173 million acquisition\nin 2022.\nThe deed was recorded for $61.8 million, and the additional $3 million spent included furniture and other credits, according to a Corcoran Group spokesperson. Corcoran\u2019s Phil and Candace Friis represented the seller.\nThe 2-acre property includes two swimming pools, an air-conditioned garage that fits more than 13 cars, a cabana, gate house and dock with boat lifts, according to the listing agents.\nIt\u2019s one of about 60 properties in Manalapan that includes access to the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, connected by an underground tunnel. The house has eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms and six half-bathrooms. The property includes 160 feet of water frontage.\nThe trust previously paid $28 million for the property in 2021, which means it more than doubled in value in four years.\nLast year, Wertheim\npaid $38 million\nfor the waterfront house at 305 Indian Road in Palm Beach. Developer Todd Glaser sold him the property. Wertheim founded and leads Brain Power, the largest producer of optical tints for eyeglasses, and has a net worth of $3.9 billion, according to Forbes, down about $2 billion since last year.\nBuyers like Manalapan because the properties are larger than Palm Beach but still close to landmarks such as President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, agents say. Ellison, one of the richest people in the world, is doubling down on his investment in Manalapan: Last year, he paid\n$277.4 million\nfor the Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa.\u00a0Earlier this year, WeatherTech founder David MacNeil spent an additional\n$55.5 million\non oceanfront property in Manalapan.

The Kevin Tsai Architecture-designed building would span 129,953 square feet.\nOf the 149 units, 23 would be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. In Los Angeles County, this is generally defined as making a maximum of between $84,850 and $89,550 for one person annually, or between $121,150 and $127,900 for a household of four. By including the affordable units, the project is eligible for density bonus incentives, permitting the developer to build more units than zoning regulations would typically allow.\nThe project will be presented to the Pasadena Design Commission for a preliminary consultation. A final vote on the development has not been scheduled.\n4D Development has been active with other\nmultifamily\nprojects in the Los Angeles area. In 2023 the firm completed the E on Adams mixed-use development at\n5181 West Adams Boulevard\n.

The buildings, at 3337, 3358 and 3435 North Southport Avenue, sit a few blocks southwest of Wrigley Field in a bustling stretch of shops and restaurants.\nThe price was not disclosed and has not yet appeared in public records. The seller was Newcastle Investors, another Chicago firm, which was represented by Mid-America Real Estate brokers Joe Girardi, Emily Gadomski and Patrick Corrigan.\nThe deal gives North American a foothold on a corridor that landlords covet for one simple reason: It\u2019s fully leased. CoStar reported that Southport Avenue between Addison and Roscoe streets has so far recorded zero vacant retail spaces in each of the past two years, according to Stone Real Estate\u2019s annual survey.\nThe three Southport Avenue buildings total about 20,000 square feet and are fully leased. The 8,692-square-foot property at 3435 North Southport is occupied by Capital One Caf\u00e9, while Tuco &amp; Blondie leases the 8,200-square-foot building at 3358 North Southport. Indira Salon &amp; Spa occupies the 3,350-square-foot building at 3337 North Southport, according to a Mid-America marketing brochure.\nThe Southport acquisition follows North American\u2019s purchase earlier this year of the retail component of Tribune Tower, as well as its purchase of the fully leased, multi-tenant Point at Clark property in Lakeview. Together, the moves highlight a strategy focused on dense neighborhoods and high-traffic retail strips.\nEr told CoStar that the timing reflects a broader shift in tenant sentiment, even in parts of Chicago that have struggled in recent years. He pointed to conversations with retailers at last week\u2019s International Council of Shopping Centers conference in\nNew York\n, where interest in the city appeared to be heating up.\nThe sale also continues a gradual pruning of Newcastle\u2019s\nportfolio\n. The firm bought the three Southport properties in separate deals in 2004, 2005 and 2015 for a combined $9 million, according to CoStar data. In recent years, it has been an active seller, including a $39 million disposition of retail at 1120 and 1130 North State Street in the\nGold Coast\n, where buyer Convexity Properties is expected to pursue a residential tower with new retail. Newcastle last year also sold adjacent apartment buildings in Rogers Park for nearly $17 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers of the 173-unit property at 2131 Crestview Lane were James Busby and Irwin Deutscher, records show.\nLido Square was at risk of losing its affordable status if state agencies didn\u2019t step in, according to a report from a meeting\no\nf the\nCalifornia Debt Limit Allocation Committee and California Tax Credit Allocation Committee\nearlier this year.\nThey recommended tax credits that will preserve affordability for another 55 years.\nThe 173 units at Lido Square consist of 171 affordable units and two manager\u2019s units.

In Contra Costa County, that\napplies\nto individuals making between $33,600 and $87,550, or $47,950 and $125,050 for a household of four.\nThe deal to keep the apartments affordable is contingent on a budget set by the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee. That $149.1 million budget includes the $90 million purchase price, $23.1 million in renovation and rehabilitation costs and a $17.4 million developer fee.\nReliant Group Management secured $11 million in financing from the California Housing Finance Agency to help fund the acquisition. Reliant Group plans to take on renovation and rehabilitation work at Lido Square.\nThe California Debt Limit Allocation Committee and\nother state agencies provide funding\nor other favorable tax vehicles to support affordable residential projects across the state.

        "content": "Construction is officially underway on the first phase of Haggard Farm, a long-planned $750 million mixed-use development that aims to remake one of the largest undeveloped tracts left in\nPlano\n.\nWork began last week on the initial phase of the project at the southeast corner of Parkwood Boulevard and Spring Creek Parkway, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The opening salvo will include about 100,000 square feet of retail, 350 multifamily units, 188 townhomes, hike-and-bike trails and a 3-acre park. Vertical construction on the retail buildings is expected to take roughly 14 months, with residential pre-leasing slated to begin about the same time. Phase one is expected to take about two years to complete.\nDallas-based\nStillwater Capital Investments\nis developing the 142-acre site along the Dallas North Tollway, and broke ground on early infrastructure in 2023. The project has been in the works for years and finally brings large-scale development to land that remained mostly untouched for more than a century.\nPlano, the largest city in Collin County, has a population north of 290,000 and is already packed with corporate campuses and mixed-use projects. Median home values hover at about $410,000.\nStillwater\nmanaging director Clay Roby said in a statement that Haggard family\u2019s homestead existed on the development site for 170 years.\n\u201cThe seeds for this development were planted generations ago,\u201d Roby said.\nWhen fully built out, Haggard Farm\u2019s plans include roughly 200,000 square feet of retail, 700 apartments, 650,000 square feet of office space, a boutique hotel with a private social club and about 10 acres of green space. Retail anchors will include The Almanac 1856, an 8,000-square-foot farm-to-table restaurant and bar, and Haggard Hall, a 16,000-square-foot event barn. Both are expected to open in fall 2027.\nStillwater is partnering with Dallas-based Woodhouse on experiential elements, and with The Retail Connection on leasing. About 40 percent of the retail mix is slated for food and beverage, with an emphasis on vendors that sell what they produce. Plans call for gardens attached to restaurants, along with nods to the site\u2019s agricultural past, including orchards, a fishing pond and even livestock.\nOffices will come later, with build-to-suit opportunities planned for corporate users. Roby said designs and permits are already in hand, with marketing expected to begin in early 2026.\nThe Haggard family, which has owned the land since the mid-1800s, secured city approval in 2021 after discussions dating back to 2019. Historic structures on the property, including a mid-1850s home and a relocated schoolhouse, will be preserved and folded into the project \u2014 a nod to Plano\u2019s past meeting its next wave of\ngrowth\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York office leasing finally\nshook out\nof its pandemic-era rut in 2025.\nIn the year that JP Morgan opened its new\n$3 billion headquarters\nat 270 Park Avenue as the ne plus ultra of the workplace, tenants showed that the office is not, in fact, dead.\nThe kinds of mega-deals that epitomized office leasing\u2019s boom years (we\u2019re looking at you, NYU, taking 1 million square feet) are back, and they\u2019re helping drive the market to record numbers.\nManhattan was on track in December to top 40 million square feet worth of deals for the year, which would be the first time it crossed that number since 2019.\nAll that activity is helping take a bite out of the glut of space left in the wake of the shutdown: Manhattan availability came down to 14.2 percent in December, according to Colliers. That\u2019s the lowest level since late 2020.\nHere are the biggest office leasing deals of 2025.\n1) New York University | 770 Broadway | 1,067,383 sf\nSteve Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust set the tone for the year in the spring, when\nit signed\nNYU to a 1.1 million-square-foot master lease at its 770 Broadway building in Greenwich Village.\nThe school said the space will be a hub for engineering, science and technology, converting the vacant floors to laboratories, classrooms and workstations. NYU has plans to eventually move some departments from rented space elsewhere as existing leases expire.\nFor its part, Vornado used some of the $935 million upfront payment NYU made to repay the property\u2019s $700 million mortgage. The lease has a 70-year term with options for NYU to buy the office portion of the building in 2055 and at the end of the lease.\nIt was the biggest lease in Manhattan since 2018 when WarnerMedia (formerly known as Time Warner) inked a deal for 1.5 million square feet in Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group\u2019s 30 Hudson Yards.\n2) Jane Street Capital | 250 Vesey Street | 1,000,000 sf\nJane Street Capital inked a new megalease at Brookfield Properties\u2019 250 Vesey Street, where the quant trading firm has been growing for the past decade.\nThe firm\nsigned\na new long-term lease for 1 million square feet at the Brookfield Place building in a 400,000-square-foot expansion. The company had originally relocated to the property in 2014 when it signed on for about 117,000 square feet, growing over the years to 600,000 before the recent deal.\nJane Street\u2019s expansion was so big that Brookfield had to relocate its own corporate offices in the building in order to make way for the trading firm\u2019s growing space.\n3) Deloitte | 70 Hudson Yards | 807,000 sf\nRelated Companies\nsigned\nthe accounting and consulting firm Deloitte as the anchor tenant for its latest Hudson Yards tower.\nDeloitte agreed to lease 800,000 square feet at 70 Hudson Yards, the 47-story, 1.1-million-square-foot building Related broke ground on in June. The new tower will include a large event space, private dining, a media-podcast studio and \u201cred eye\u201d suites for use after flights.\nDeloitte\u2019s big lease is a sign that major companies want to occupy high-quality spaces as they bring workers back to the office, and it\u2019s one of a handful of deals in 2025 that helped kick off new office developments.\n4) Citadel | 660 Fifth Avenue | 502,528 sf\nSpeaking of development-driving tenants, Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel (which in 2022 partnered with Vornado and Rudin to kick off 350 Park Avenue) is still hungry for more space.\nThe market-making securities firm\nsigned on\nfor 504,000 square feet at Brookfield Properties\u2019 660 Fifth Avenue. The owner recently completed a $400 million redevelopment and modernization of the 1.25 million-square-foot building formerly known as 666 Fifth.\nCitadel is expected to move from one of its current locations at 350 Park Avenue, which will be torn down (along with 40 E. 52nd Street) and redeveloped by Vornado and Rudin as a 1.8 million-square-foot, 1,600-foot-tall tower designed by Foster + Partners.\nCitadel signed on as the anchor tenant, agreeing to take about 850,000 square feet.\n5) United Nations Association | Two United Nations Plaza | 425,190 sf\nThe United Nations consolidated its office space as part of a $500 million development plan for One and Two United Nations Plaza.\nThe U.N. signed a lease for 425,190 square feet of space across 26 stories at 2 United Nations Plaza, in addition to two stories of retail at 1 United Nations Plaza.\nThe landlord is the United Nations Development Corporation, a public benefit corporation established by New York State. The redevelopment will include energy-efficient upgrades to some 900,000 square feet of space across the two buildings.\nThe UNDC plans to issue up to $380 million in bonds to fund the project, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and Siebert Williams Shank.\n6) Horizon Media | 75 Varick Street | 360,000 sf\nHorizon Media signed a 17-year extension on its 360,000-square-foot space at Hudson Square Properties\u2019 75 Varick Street, where it\u2019s been a tenant since 2010.\nThe company \u2014 which puts together advertising campaigns for companies like Burger King, GEICO and Peloton \u2014 occupies six floors of the 18-story building owned through a partnership among Trinity Church NYC, Norges Bank Investment Management and Hines.\nThe financial terms of the deal weren\u2019t available, but asking rents in the building were reportedly around $90 per square foot in 2023.\n7) Guggenheim Partners | 330 Madison Avenue | 360,000 sf\nInvestment firm Guggenheim Partners grew its space by about 50 percent as it\nsigned on\nfor another 17 years.\nThe company expanded from 240,000 square feet to 360,000 square feet when it renewed its space at Munich Re\u2019s 330 Madison Avenue.\nAsking rents in the 850,000 square-foot building start in the low $90s per square foot at the base and climb to more than $100 on higher floors. With the Guggenheim deal, the building is 100 percent occupied.\n8) Universal Music Group | 2 Pennsylvania Plaza | 336,000 sf\nUniversal Music Group is leaving its current Broadway digs early in order\nto relocate\nto Penn Plaza.\nThe music publisher signed a 22-year lease for 336,000 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s 2 Penn.\nThe company\u2019s current lease at Jack Resnick &amp; Sons\u2019 1755 Broadway isn\u2019t set to end until 2028, but UMG plans to finalize its relocation in 2027. UMG is also expanding from its current 242,505-square-foot lease.\n9) Amazon | 10 Bryant Park | 330,000 sf\nAmazon took over HSBC\u2019s former headquarters space as it continues to gobble up Manhattan office space.\nThe tech firm\nsigned on\nfor 330,000 square feet at Property &amp; Building Corp\u2019s 10 Bryant Park, formerly known as the HSBC tower. The 30-story building is next to the Lord &amp; Taylor building that Amazon bought in 2020 for $1.2 billion and uses as its Manhattan headquarters.\nAmazon\u2019s lease starts at $29.5 million per year and increases to $34.8 million after 10 years.\nThat wasn\u2019t the only mega lease the company signed this year. Amazon also leased\n259,000 square feet\nat CIM Group and QSuper\u2019s 1440 Broadway.\n10) Salesforce | 3 Bryant Park | 310,500 sf\nTech giant Salesforce\nexpanded\nat its namesake Manhattan office building, even as the company said it was able to cut thousands of jobs due to AI.\nThe company tacked on 71,000 square feet onto La Caisse\u2019s 3 Bryant Park, bringing its total footprint to about 311,000 square feet and extending its lease to May 2029.\nSalesforce will use the additional space for an employee training center, collaboration and hybrid-work areas, as well as space for a customer-focused initiative.\n",

The building at 2230 Eberhardt Road is slated for completion in September.\nThe most expensive of these projects all year is in Midlothian, just south of Dallas/Fort Worth, where Google has budgeted $880 million for a one-story, 288,000-square-foot data center. Demand for data centers put\nDFW in second place nationally among data center markets\nin 2024, according to CBRE.\nAnd in Haskell, a Panhandle Plains town more than two hours west of Fort Worth, Google began work on a $350 million, 350,000-square-foot project this month.

The interests in the hospitality properties are located in 17 states across the country, including more than a dozen in New York City.\nThe portfolio is derived from Sonder\u2019s business model, which saw it sign long-term leases with apartment and hotel owners, then turning around and renting out units as short-term rentals.\nInterested parties can put in bids for as many or as few leasehold interests as they\u2019d like. But they need to act quickly, as the first round of bids is due by Dec. 30.\n\u201cGordon Brothers has been fully engaged in this process and we are confident that their team will provide valuable assistance to maximize value for the estates,\u201d said the trustee managing Sonder\u2019s wind-down.\nSonder bit the dust a little more than a month ago, announcing plans for an immediate end to operations and the pursuit of Chapter 7 liquidation of its United States business.\nThe announcement came one day after Sonder\u2019s partnership with Marriott International\ncollapsed\n; Marriott terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, alleging the short-term operator was in default on an agreement signed last year.\n\u201cWe are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\u201d interim chief executive officer Janice Sears said in a statement at the time.\nThe company\u2019s market value before the shutdown announcement was $6.79 million, according to LSEG, a far drop from the $2.2 billion valuation at the time of its initial public offering in 2021.\nIn its final quarterly report, Sonder noted \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to remain as a going concern. As of the end of June, Sonder counted $1 billion of assets and $1.5 billion in liabilities.\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court\napproved\nthe sale of Sonder\u2019s assets last week. Winning bidders need to provide proof of funds by Jan. 9. Sales are scheduled to close before the end of January.\n",

        "content": "More than three dozen owners of marquee commercial properties are suing Broward County Property Appraiser Marty Kiar, alleging his office improperly calculated market and assessed values, saddling them with inflated tax bills.\nThe lawsuits, filed between November and this month in Broward County Circuit Court, involve some of the county\u2019s best-known hotels, office towers and retail complexes.\nThe properties are in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, Pompano Beach and other major Broward cities.\nThe cases challenge how Kiar\u2019s office valued high-profile commercial real estate assets across sectors, from hospitality and gaming to Class A office and regional retail.\nThe property owners allege the appraiser\u2019s methodologies overstate real market value, which in turn drove up their property taxes.\nMany of the complaints were filed during a narrow legal window tied to the certification of the tax roll, after challenges to the county\u2019s value adjustment board. The timing of the litigation reflects the certification deadline rather than an unusual spike in controversy, said Mila Schwartzreich, general counsel for the Broward property appraiser.\nProperty owners have 60 days from the date the value adjustment board certifies the tax rolls to file lawsuits. They are prohibited from doing so once the 60-day deadline expires, Schwartzreich said.\nEach county certifies its tax roll on a different schedule, so litigation waves often track those calendars rather than broader market shifts, she said.\nBroward processes significantly more parcels than some entire states, but relatively few assessments end up in court compared to other Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, she said.\nMost of the plaintiffs are represented by Samuel Brandan Lynch, a shareholder with the Orlando-based law firm Lowndes. He told\nThe Real Deal\nhe is not authorized to comment on the cases.\nAmong the owners suing Kiar\u2019s office are Trinity Investments, led by Sean Hehir, and Credit Suisse, which own the Diplomat Beach Resort Hollywood. The property appraiser determined the oceanfront, 1,000-room hotel at 3555 Ocean Drive in Hollywood had a market and assessed value of $589.9 million in 2024, court records show. The owners paid roughly $12.3 million in property taxes.\nIn 2023, Trinity and Credit Suisse paid roughly\n$850 million\nfor the resort and two adjacent parcels that the partnership subsequently sold to Aventura-based BH Group and Coconut Grove-based Related Group.\nOther notable plaintiffs include:\nAn affiliate of New York-based Brookfield, led by Bruce Fiatt, which owns the\nHilton Fort Lauderdale Marina\n, a 595-room hotel at 181 Southeast 17th Street. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $140.3 million and an assessed value of $139.9 million in 2024. The owner paid $2.6 million in property taxes. In 2018, Brookfield paid $170.6 million for the hotel.\nAn affiliate of Russell Galbut\u2019s Miami-based GFO Investments, Fort Lauderdale-based InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance. The joint venture owns Galleria Fort Lauderdale, an indoor mall at 2414 East Sunrise Boulevard that Kiar\u2019s office determined had a market value $74.4 million and an assessed value $74.3 million in 2024. The partnership paid $101,215 in property taxes. The joint venture acquired the mall for\n$73 million\nin September.\nAn affiliate of The Stronach Group, led by Belinda Stronach, which owns\nGulfstream Park\nat 901 South Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach. The property appraiser determined the gambling, retail and entertainment site has a market value of $87.4 million and an assessed value of $85.7 million in 2024. Stronach\u2019s affiliate paid $1.3 million in property taxes.\nAn affiliate of Fort Lauderdale-based Stiles Corporation, led by Kenneth Stiles. The development firm owns the\nAutoNation office building\nat 200 Southwest First Avenue in Fort Lauderdale. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $78.6 million and an assessed value of $72.8 million in 2024. The Stiles affiliate paid $1.4 million in property taxes.",

Air quality, access to open space and potential displacement of residents and businesses are top concerns.\n\u201cThe rezoning represents a wholescale departure from longstanding public policy that respects air quality, health concerns, open space, air and light, stress on sensitive historical sites, socioeconomic displacement and priorities for affordable housing,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nMudd faces an uphill battle. Jack Lester, an attorney who\nfiled unsuccessful lawsuits\ncontesting City of Yes and the recent charter revision ballot questions, is arguing the nonprofit\u2019s case on similar grounds to those dismissed cases.\nIn August, the City Council unanimously approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, rezoning 42 blocks in the Midtown neighborhood for housing development. It\u2019s expected to result in 9,535 housing units \u2014 2,842 set aside as affordable \u2014 representing the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years.\nThe rezoning created two new high-density residential\ndistricts\nthat require Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and also allowed for the construction of housing projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. It was the first time that these districts were used after the state lifted the city\u2019s long-standing cap on residential floor area ratio of 12.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant Gold Coast development site could finally get moving again.\nConvexity Properties wants to build a 28-story apartment tower at the corner of State and Elm streets in Chicago, reviving a prominent parcel where a previous owner\u2019s high-rise plan stalled for four years. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the developer unveiled its proposal during an online community meeting Monday hosted by 2nd Ward Alderman Brian Hopkins\u2019 office.\nConvexity\n, the real estate arm of Chicago-based trading firm DRW Holdings, is planning a 307-unit apartment tower at 1120 and 1130 North State Street. The firm bought the site for $39 million\nin August\nfrom\nNewcastle Investors\n, which had secured Chicago City Council approval in 2021 for a slightly taller project, but never broke ground.\nNewcastle\u2019s approved plan called for a 304-unit, 345-foot tower. Convexity\u2019s version would top out at about 312 feet and feature a different design: two interlocking L-shaped towers rising from a multi-story podium containing nearly 24,000 square feet of retail space.\nWhy Newcastle walked away remains unclear, but interest rates, surging construction costs and a tougher capital markets environment have knocked out numerous Chicago proposals since the pandemic. The result has been a thin development pipeline, with fewer than 600 new rental units expected to deliver across downtown in 2026, the outlet reported.\nConvexity is now shopping for financing, director Chris Oakley told the publication, though he declined to disclose estimated development costs, adding that the\nGold Coast\nsite is in a prominent locale.\nThe site is currently occupied by a vacant two-story former Barnes &amp; Noble that has sat dark for years, along with a Lou Malnati\u2019s restaurant at 1120 North State Street. That lease expires in summer 2026 without an extension option, though Oakley said the pizza chain could reappear in the new retail space.\nThe apartment mix would include studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Convexity plans to designate eight apartments as affordable and pay roughly $4.5 million in in-lieu fees under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, rather than providing more on-site affordable housing.\nBecause the zoning was already approved for Newcastle\u2019s project, Convexity does not need a new City Council vote. The plan still requires administrative approval from the Department of Planning and Development to confirm zoning compliance.\nHopkins said the earlier proposal faced some neighborhood resistance, forcing a height reduction, but there\u2019s broad agreement that the long-languishing vacant retail site has become a problem.\nIf approved, Convexity aims to start construction in June and complete the tower in spring 2028. The firm has a track record nearby, including the Viceroy Hotel next door and the condo building at 4 East Elm Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Lissette Calderon, the\nRubell\nreal estate and art family, and\nLion Development Group\nare partnering on a three-phase residential project in Miami\u2019s Allapattah neighborhood,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe trio plans part I of the project as a 21-story, 330-unit rental highrise with 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail at 1000 Northwest 23rd Street, according to the developers\u2019 news release.\u00a0 Construction of the building is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2027, and completion is expected in the first half of 2029.\nCalderon\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Neology Group, the Rubell family and Michael Simkins\u2019 Miami-based Lion Development plan two subsequent phases, to be announced next year, the release said. The project is being developed in a nod toward Allapattah\u2019s growth as an arts and culture district.\nThe project marks a new partnership between\nCalderon\nand the\nRubells\n, both powerhouses in the Allapattah neighborhood. It also comes amid a South Florida multifamily\nslowdown\ndue to hefty deliveries of new units in the past two years, and a calmer influx of out-of-staters, leading to slower lease-ups and more concessions.\nDevelopers have argued the market will\npick up\nby the time they finish their apartment projects in the coming years.\nThe Rubell family owns the 1-acre development site where the first highrise is planned, property records show. The land also is near the\nRubell Museum\n, a 100,000-square-foot art campus with 33 galleries in several interconnected warehouses. The museum is at 1100 Northwest 23rd Street.\nThe Rubells, who have been Miami Beach developers for years, opened their collection to the public in 1993 in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Over the past decade, Wynwood was supercharged as an arts district and real estate market, and the Rubells moved their collection to Allapattah in 2019, where they\u2019ve also been amassing properties.\nSimkins\u2019 Lion has partnered on projects elsewhere in Miami, including the 659-unit\n38 West Eleventh Residences Miami\ncondo tower with PMG and Marc Roberts, one of a slew of towers the trio plans.\nAllapattah, traditionally a Dominican enclave where the primary industry once was fruitpacking, has attracted developers\u2019 and gallerists\u2019 eyes.\nIn Allapattah, Calderon\u2019s completed apartment projects in recent years include the 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\n, finished in 2021; the 323-unit\nThe Julia Residences\n, which was finished this year; and the 237-unit\nFourteen Main Street Residences\n, also completed this year.\n",

        "content": "Just as one lawsuit clears up for Ruben Espinoza, another one takes its place.\nThe Florida-based real estate investor is currently involved in at least six ongoing lawsuits related to his business dealings in the Chicago area while facing default judgments in two others.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of his active and recently resolved legal disputes related to Chicago-area commercial property deals.\nPartners turn on each other at 300 West Adams\nEspinoza and Chicago-based investor Igor Gabal scored the deal of a lifetime in late 2023 when they bought a struggling office building at 300 West Adams\nfor $4 million or $17 a foot\n.\nBut after\nsuccessfully fighting off a legal challenge\nfrom\na pair of investors\nwho claimed they were cut out of a deal to buy the building, Espinoza and Gabal\nturned on each other\n.\nEspinoza filed a lawsuit against Gabal in May, claiming he had mishandled a $6.2 million insurance payout and should no longer have access to their shared bank accounts.\nAs the legal drama dragged on over the past year, Gabal\u2019s defense requested that a judge dismiss the lawsuit altogether because he claimed that Espinoza has been exhibiting the same behavior that he is accusing Gabal of engaging in.\nGabal claimed in a filing last month that Espinoza should not be granted sole access to their shared bank accounts because he has allegedly siphoned off $1.5 million without Gabal\u2019s consent.\nThe lawsuit is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nEspinoza didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did his attorneys regarding this dispute or any others mentioned in this story.\nLender wins receiver request amid a $68M foreclosure dispute\nIf Espinoza has any hope of hanging onto a portfolio of Southwest Side commercial buildings, it is likely dwindling.\nLast month, a judge appointed receiver Scott Shefman of Friedman Real Estate Management to take control of Espinoza\u2019s portfolio of two commercial buildings amid an ongoing foreclosure dispute filed by Wilmington National Trust.\nEspinoza\nhas defaulted on $68 million in mortgage debts\nhe took on for commercial complexes on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side, according to Wilmington.\nHe allegedly owes more than $43 million, including interest and fees, for the Chicago Business Center, a 661,000-square-foot mixed-use building with office space and a distribution facility at 2600 West 35th Street.\nThe remaining $24 million he owes is tied to a 110,000-square-foot distribution center just across the Chicago River to the northwest, at 2455 South Damen Avenue.\nIndian Lakes Hotel heads to court for a second time\nEspinoza\u2019s plans to revive a storied suburban hotel along with hospitality magnate Robert Habeeb quickly went south last year when lender CRE Bridge Capital foreclosed on the property, alleging that the pair of investors had\ndefaulted on a $3.5 million bridge loan\non the property known as The Indian Lakes Hotel.\nSoon after, the lender sold the vacant hotel to the village of Bloomingdale for $5 million.\nBut Espinoza and Habeeb\u2019s involvement with the hotel didn\u2019t end there.\nThe pair are suing CRE Bridge Capital, led by Daniel Sobelman, in a complaint filed last month alleging that the lender never had the legal standing to file the foreclosure and ultimately sell the property.\nEspinoza and Habeeb allege payment statements CRE Bridge Capital issued to the borrowers were \u201cuntimely, inaccurate and in some cases, incomprehensible.\u201d\nAs a result, CRE Bridge Capital \u201cmanufactured a breach of loan agreement \u2026 to seize Plaintiff\u2019s real estate in a collusive UCC sale for a pittance,\u201d Espinoza and Habeeb argue.\nThe lawsuit claims the property could have been worth up to $70 million after Espinoza and Habeeb completed their redevelopment plans.\nA hearing on the matter is scheduled for January 14.\nA state senator\u2019s property tax law firm scores a win\nEspinoza\u2019s legal troubles entered the political realm earlier this year.\nState Sen. Robert F. Martwick Jr., who represents Illinois\u2019 10th Senate District\nfiled a lawsuit against Espinoza earlier\nin July for failing to pay Martwick\u2019s law firm, Finkel, Martwick &amp; Colson.\nMartwick\u2019s firm claimed it was owed more than $1 million by Espinoza and his real estate ventures.\nThe law firm netted property tax savings for the landlord at big Chicago buildings, all of which are now subject to foreclosure proceedings. Finkel\u2019s contracts with Espinoza, which were signed by Martwick, pertain to its tax work for each of the last four years, according to the complaint filed in Cook County court in July.\nIn October, a judge issued a default order, requiring Espinoza to pay the law firm $631,000 in damages.\nAnother portfolio faces foreclosure\nIn another foreclosure case, Espinoza is fighting back.\nHe is\nfacing a foreclosure lawsuit\nover a $9.6 million loan he took on for a set of River North loft office buildings at 215-223 West Ohio Street.\nRialto Capital filed the foreclosure in March, but rather than give up the keys, Espinoza is disputing the foreclosure.\nThe case is still pending.\nA commercial tenant claims fraud\nFor the second time, a commercial tenant is claiming Espinoza took a deposit and first month\u2019s rent but never allowed them to move in.\nProduce wholesaler Galfresh Produce signed a lease with Espinoza to move into one of his commercial spaces but, the company alleges in a June lawsuit, it was never granted access to the space.\nThe Damen avenue commercial building is the same property currently being foreclosed on by Wilmington Trust.\nGalfresh is suing Espinoza in an effort to recoup its $98,000 deposit and the $49,000 the company put down as first month\u2019s rent.\nThe dispute mirrors\na similar lawsuit filed by a local soccer club\nlast year that claimed Espinoza also took a deposit and first month of rent for a space that was occupied by another tenant who had no plans to move out. That case was dismissed without prejudice but re-filed in October 2025 with the soccer club\u2019s lawyer alleging it still hadn\u2019t been paid back.\nIn October, a judge ordered Espinoza pay Galfresh back but Espinoza is fighting that order, claiming he was never properly served.\nA personal loan goes unpaid\nAs Espinoza forged ahead in his other legal battles, he was hit with another filing December 5.\nAn entity known as Ohio Street Investments claims that Espinoza has failed to pay back a $350,000 personal loan that Ohio Street Investments issued to him in late 2022.\nThe case is pending.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office tower in downtown Galveston is finally poised for a comeback, with plans to reopen as a boutique hotel after sitting empty for decades.\nPort Arthur-based Itex Group expects to kick off construction in February on the historic Medical Arts Building at 302 Moody Avenue, redeveloping the 11-story structure into a 120-room hotel dubbed The Quay,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The project hinges on recently secured city permits and would mark the closest the property has come to redevelopment since the 1980s.\nThe hotel will join Hilton\u2019s Tapestry Collection, a brand aimed at locally styled, independent properties, with Florida-based\nDriftwood Hospitality Management\ntapped to operate it, the outlet reported. Plans call for a mix of suites and rooms, along with a ground-floor restaurant and bar. Itex is targeting a January 2028 opening.\nThe building\u2019s site is part of the bet. Sitting at the edge of The Strand district and within a few blocks of Galveston\u2019s cruise terminals and Pier 21, the property is aimed to capture leisure travelers and event-driven demand, as well as business tied to nearby corporations and the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch\n.\nItex bought the property in 2016 intending to convert it into apartments, an idea previously floated by former owner Andy Vickery, who also explored a timeshare concept, according to the Galveston County Daily News. The pandemic ultimately pushed Itex to abandon the residential plan in favor of hospitality, which CEO Chris Akbari said now pencils out better, given Galveston\u2019s tourism and cruise traffic.\nThe Medical Arts Building dates to 1929 and was developed by William L. Moody Jr.\u2019s American National Insurance Company as an annex to its nearby headquarters. Once home to medical offices, the tower has been vacant since the 1980s and has deteriorated significantly. Parts of the exterior have fallen away, windows are missing and the interior was fully gutted years ago.\nItex plans to tackle the exterior first before rebuilding the interior, balancing historic preservation with modern hotel layouts.\nHouston-based MCS Architects\nis designing the project, while a general contractor has yet to be selected.\nThe redevelopment would land amid a broader refresh of Galveston\u2019s hotel stock. Several marquee properties have recently undergone renovations, including Tremont House and Grand Galvez, while Hotel Lucine reopened in 2023 after decades as a roadside motel, according to the publication. On the island\u2019s East Beach, Dallas-based\nRREAF Holdings\nis pushing ahead with a $700 million Margaritaville resort and residential project.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Wrigley, an heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune,\nset a record for North Palm Beach\nand the Lost Tree Village neighborhood with the sale. The deal is one of the biggest to close in South Florida this year.\nClarke is chairman and CEO of Corpay, a multibillion-dollar digital payments company that\u2019s headquartered in Atlanta. The company was previously called FleetCor. He is worth $1.5 billion, according to Forbes.\nThe property includes two mansions, built in 2013 and 2014, and multiple docks. Wrigley paid $11 million for the larger property in 2009 and $6.1 million for the smaller piece in 2010, records show.\nSerhant\u2019s\nGary Pohrer\nrepresented Wrigley, while Douglas Elliman\u2019s Donna Hutchins represented the buyer.\nClarke and his wife, Leeanne, also own a waterfront mansion in Jupiter, records show. They paid $15.7 million for the 9,300-square-foot house at 194 Spyglass Court in 2022, in a deal that was also brokered by Pohrer, who was then with Elliman.\nWrigley is worth $3.6 billion, according to Forbes. He took over the family business in 1999 and sold the company to Mars Inc. in 2008 for $23 billion.\nThe previous record for Lost Tree Village was set in May with the\n$55 million sale\nof Canadian baby products mogul Maurice Pinsonnault\u2019s mansion at 12032 East End. A hidden buyer purchased that home as well.\nOracle billionaire Larry Ellison\u2019s\n$80 million\npurchase of a 7.4-acre oceanfront property in the gated Seminole Landing community was previously the most-expensive sale in North Palm Beach.\n",

The fresh financing replaces a $170 million loan from real estate finance and investment management firm PCCP.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Jonathan Schwartz and Keith Kurland arranged the loan on behalf of the landlord.\nThe refinancing follows a $107 million capital improvement program that transformed the landmarked 278,000-square-foot property into a loft-style Class A office building. That investment appears to be paying off. Microsoft and\nfintech firm Chime\nanchor the building under long-term leases.\nBuilt in 1900, the 10-story building between West 17th and 18th streets has been owned by Bromley since 1979. In 1987, Barnes &amp; Noble moved its headquarters to the 300,000-square-foot building, where it remained for more than three decades.\nAfter the bookseller was acquired by hedge fund Elliott Management Corp in 2019, it opted not to renew the headquarter\u2019s lease, prompting the renovation project to upgrade the entire building, including the addition of modern amenities and an 18,700-square-foot roof deck.\nThe Flatiron District, part of the Midtown South submarket, has remained one of Manhattan\u2019s more resilient submarkets, buoyed by tech and financial tenants. Year-to-date easing activity in Midtown South totaled 7.2 million square feet, up 69 percent from the prior year, per CBRE. The availability rate is 19.2 percent, down 3.7 percent from a year ago.\n",

        "content": "As Netflix and Paramount fight to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Hackman Capital Partners is bracing for impact.\nLos Angeles-based Hackman, the largest independent owner and operator of soundstages, is facing high studio vacancy rates and depressed rents, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The firm owns more than 60 soundstages at six studio properties in the L.A. region but has seen occupancy shift as more productions move outside the city.\nRegardless of whether Netflix or Paramount emerges as the buyer of Warner Bros. Discovery, demand for soundstage space will likely drop as Warner Bros. owns a large amount of\nits own studio real estate\n, leading the new buyer to shift production from leased stages to its owned facilities.\n\u201cThe whole ecosystem is really under distress,\u201d Michael Hackman, CEO of Hackman Capital, told the Journal.\nFilm and TV productions are pursuing cheaper labor and filming costs overseas as countries like Canada,\nAustralia\nand some European nations offer incentives to work there instead.\nHackman is hopeful that the\nTrump\nadministration will back the U.S. entertainment business with tariffs on countries offering these incentives and tax breaks for productions that stay local for filming. \u201cA lot is going to depend on support from the government helping to offset some of these advantages they have outside the U.S.,\u201d Hackman said.\nHackman began investing heavily in\nstudio ownership\na decade ago with its acquisition of Culver Studios in 2014. Since then, the firm has bought more than 2 million square feet of production space worldwide, most of it in the Los Angeles region. The 2023 writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes led to increased studio cost-cutting, reflected in the exodus to other filming locations today.\nLast year saw nearly 30 percent fewer big-budget U.S. film and TV projects begin shooting compared to 2022, per ProdProp data cited by the Journal. This year continued the downward trend with an additional 12 percent drop through November compared with the same period in 2024.\n\u201cWe all thought that when the strikes ended, there would be all this pent-up demand for Hollywood production,\u201d John Kim, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told the Journal. \u201cBut it\u2019s spread out. Even though [content companies] are based in Los Angeles, they can produce anywhere globally.\u201d\nFor now, Hackman is tightening up its finances, which includes scaling back the construction of a major campus planned in the Dublin, Ireland, area. If local production in Los Angeles doesn\u2019t return to its former heights, studio landlords like Hackman may have to\nfind other uses for their soundstage campuses\n, such as live events and themed attractions based on movies.\n\u201cThe industry is evolving,\u201d Hackman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay passive.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Citadel is quietly pulling back further from Chicago, downsizing its remaining local operations and vacating the downtown tower that once bore its name.\nThe hedge fund is relocating what\u2019s left of its Chicago staff into roughly 50,000 square feet north of the Chicago River to 353 North Clark Street, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News\nreported\n. The new office amounts to about 10 percent of the space Citadel occupied in 2020, when it was the main tenant at the 37-story Citadel Center at\n131 South Dearborn Street\n. The Loop tower is now\non the market\nand no longer carries the firm\u2019s branding.\nThe move highlights how thoroughly billionaire founder\nKen Griffin\nhas unwound Citadel\u2019s Chicago presence since decamping to Florida. Citadel shifted its headquarters to Miami in 2022 and has steadily relocated staff to Miami and New York. The firm once employed roughly 1,100 people in Chicago. That number has dropped to about 200, according to the publication.\nGriffin\u2019s high-profile exit, driven by public complaints over taxes, crime and governance, has become a touchstone in Chicago\u2019s ongoing debate over its business climate. Mayor Brandon Johnson is now pushing a revived version of the city\u2019s controversial \u201chead tax,\u201d proposing a\n$33-per-employee levy\non companies with at least 500 workers to fund public safety. Business groups and much of the City Council oppose the idea. Former mayor Rahm Emanuel once dubbed the tax a \u201cjob killer.\u201d\nCitadel\u2019s pullback adds to a list of corporate departures that includes Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods. But Griffin\u2019s move carries outsized symbolic and economic weight, stripping the city of some of its highest-paid finance jobs and a major philanthropic benefactor. The outlet reported that Griffin donated more than $600 million to Chicago institutions, including a $125 million gift to the city\u2019s science museum, now named for him. Since relocating, he has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to Florida causes.\nThe retrenchment has rippled through real estate as well. Griffin reportedly took a roughly $30 million loss unloading six luxury condos in the Gold Coast. His final Chicago property remains unsold.\nChicago\u2019s finance sector has also felt the sting. State data show finance employment in Illinois is down nearly 3 percent since Griffin left, a blow to a city that helped invent the modern futures market and remains home to CME Group and Cboe Global Markets.\nCity Hall has pushed back on the narrative that Chicago is hostile to business. A spokesperson for Johnson told Bloomberg that Griffin left for political reasons, not economic ones, and pointed to recent large downtown leases as evidence of resilience. Still, Johnson\u2019s approval ratings have sagged, voters rejected his proposed hike to the real estate transfer tax on high-end sales, and Governor JB Pritzker vowed to veto a financial transaction tax.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That officially launches the application into the seven-month Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which will require approvals from numerous stakeholders before Kensico can go forward.\nHoteliers Nabil and Fouad Chartouni are planning the Lowell Modern, a companion to the luxury Lowell Hotel in the Upper East Side. Their proposal calls for 96 rooms, amenities and a lobby across 139,000 square feet, fronted on East 53rd Street. There would also be 3,300 square feet of retail space on the ground floor fronting Madison Avenue.\nInterior demolition of the office building is already underway and the final tenants are expected to leave after Christmas, according to an adviser to Kensico. Tenants at the building at the time the\napplication was filed\nin August include investment firm Banyan Tree Capital Management, private equity firm Yellowstone Capital Partners and Kensico itself.\nFull demolition and construction is expected to start at the beginning of the new year, targeting an early 2028 completion.\nIn 2017, Kensico\nput its leasehold of the office property on the market\n, even though it boasted high occupancy rates that remained strong. The leasehold never sold, forcing the pivot.\nKensico has developed and invested more than $2 billion in real estate across the globe, spanning office, retail and hospitality properties. The Lowell Hotel, which it acquired in the 1980s, is considered one of the more luxurious hospitality properties in all of New York City.\nBut hotel development has become increasingly hard to come by in the Big Apple, and not just because of how the pandemic temporarily disrupted tourism. A 2021 City Council bill mandated a special permit for new hotel developments, essentially\nfreezing the sector\u2019s construction pipeline\n; not a single permit was approved in the first year of the legislation.\nThe daunting prospect of developing a hotel today could come with a big reward on the other end. The lack of incoming supply \u2014 plus a crackdown on the short-term rental industry \u2014 is helping to boost the occupancy and room rates of properties that hung tight through the lean years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The developers will also be required to build a 2,000-square-foot dog park on site, Jim Bell, a Boca Raton project manager, told council members.\nAn affiliate of Meyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group, now led by CEO Alan Losada, and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso Partners, acquired the 10.5-acre office property that\u2019s adjacent to an 18-hole golf course for\n$25 million in 2024\n.\nThe Atrium project is just one of developments that are moving forward within or near the Park at Broken Sound.

The property, at 735 South Figueroa Street, includes 330,000 square feet of gross leasable area anchored by tenants such as Target, Sephora and Zara. The center is 85.8 percent occupied, per the broker.\nThe mall \u201ccould fetch $70 million,\u201d according to Green Street.\nThat would put the price around $210 per square foot, well off the $915 per square foot fetched by the Runway Playa Vista retail component a couple months ago, per a CBRE\nreport\n, and the $711 per square foot price of One Westside in the Sawtelle neighborhood.\nBrookfield\u2019s property, meanwhile, is at the heart of L.A\u00a0 \u2014 kitty-corner from the 7th Street Metro Center and adjacent to the Korean Air building, the tallest of the city\u2019s skyscrapers.\nBrookfield is nearly at the end of a three-year\nextension\non a $58.5 million loan it got from MetLife. In any case, Brookfield is vacating the Financial District, which generally is considered to include Bunker Hill, where the commercial giant, lenders, special servicers and receivers have individual hands in peddling four\ndistressed offices\n, with a combined square footage that accounts for about 18 percent of Class A space in the area.\nThe office properties connected to Brookfield and currently on the market include\nBank of America Plaza\n, Wells Fargo Center\u2019s twin towers and\nEY Plaza\n.\nAnother downtown retail property Brookfield owns, on the same parcel as Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower, is called the Halo. The three-story, 63,000-square-foot property sits between sister skyscrapers, and is included in Eastdil Secured\u2019s\nmarketing\nof the mortgage loan connected to 333 South Grand Avenue, which has $506 million debt in default.\nBrookfield, which did not respond to a request for comment, has a property in another part of downtown: California Market Center at 9th and Main streets. The complex offers about 1.9 million square feet of office and other commercial space, where the Fashion District meets the Historic Core of downtown.\nFIGat7th is surrounded by offices, including\nEY Plaza\n, which is in the hands of a court-appointed receiver, with the $275 million non-preforming note connected to the tower being marketed by Colliers.

        "content": "A major North San Antonio retail complex changed hands, marking one of the region\u2019s largest shopping center trades this year.\nWest Palm Beach, Florida-based Sterling Organization sold the 45.6-acre Park North Shopping Center, adjacent to North Star Mall, for $115 million, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n. The buyer is Houston-based\nDhanani Private Equity Group\n, marking its first acquisition in the Alamo City.\nThe 635,000-square-foot property is at 842 Northwest Loop 410 and is anchored by a Super Target. The sale did not include the Aloft hotel on Blanco Road or the former Sears building on San Pedro Avenue, which has been permanently shuttered.\nSterling\nbought the retail center in 2016 for $81 million, netting a sizable gain after nearly a decade.\nPark North was built in 2004 as an entertainment-driven retail center on the former site of Central Park Mall, one of San Antonio\u2019s earliest enclosed malls. That property, opened in 1968, fell into decline by the 1990s and was demolished in 2003. Developers\nPGIM Real Estate\nand local investor Mark Granados restructured the site as a 24-hour shopping center, leaning heavily into dining and entertainment.\nToday, Park North includes a mix of national, regional and local tenants, including Pinstack, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, Norris Conference Centers, World Market and Outlaw Pickleball. The center draws roughly 7.1 million visitors annually, ranking it among the most heavily trafficked shopping destinations in the metro area, according to the outlet.\nSterling said in a press release that it boosted occupancy at the property from 73 percent to 93 percent during its ownership, including through the pandemic, when entertainment-heavy retail faced acute pressure. The firm continues to own other San Antonio projects, including Thousand Oaks Shopping Center and the Village at Stone Oak. It sold the Grandview Shopping Center for $21.9 million in 2017.\nThe deal is a beachhead for\nDhanani\nin a tight retail market. According to Weitzman\u2019s mid-year report, San Antonio retail occupancy is at a near-record 95.2 percent, driven by steady tenant demand and limited new construction. The metro has maintained occupancy above 90 percent for 15 straight years, commanding premium pricing.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The price amounts to $493 per square foot.\nTerra paid $12.5 million for the 3.9-acre development site at 3737 Northwest 87th Avenue in 2018, records show.\nMark Gilbert with Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokered the transaction.\nDoral Square was listed without an asking price, but the buyer based its offer on an analysis of the shopping center\u2019s financial statements within the offering memorandum, IMC Chief Investment Officer Carlos Segrera told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nDesigned by Miami-based Touzet Studio, Doral Square is anchored by Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, and UFC Gym. Other tenants include Pet Supermarket, AT&amp;T, Jersey Mike\u2019s and Panda Express.\nIMC Equity purchased Doral Square as part of 1031 exchange, a mechanism via the IRS that allows real estate investors to swap one investment property for another without immediately paying capital gains taxes. In September, IMC Equity sold Festival Marketplace, a shuttered indoor flea market in Pompano Beach, for\n$66 million\nto Foundry Commercial and Wheelock Capital.\nDoral Square is the replacement property, Segrera said.\nIMC Equity is a commercial real estate development and investment firm with more than $3 billion in assets under management, the release states. Counting Doral Square, the firm owns 72 shopping centers across Florida, according to its website.\nInvestor activity is strong in South Florida\u2019s retail real estate market.\nVacancies creeped up\nto 3.2 percent and rents slipped modestly in Miami-Dade this year, according to Colliers.\nIn other recent South Florida shopping center deals, Publix acquired Polo Club Shops in Boca Raton for\n$83 million\n. The 134,800-square-foot retail plaza is anchored by one of the Lakeland-based grocery chain\u2019s supermarkets.\nLast month, New York-based JPMorgan paid\n$53.7 million\nfor Shoppes at Heron Lakes, a Coral Springs shopping center.",

        "content": "The mystery buyer of one of the Chicago area\u2019s priciest home sales this year stepped into the light \u2014 and he\u2019s planning a careful refresh of a North Shore landmark.\nCal Akin, a Brookfield, Wisconsin-based multifamily developer, paid $11 million in October for an eight-bedroom, 11,787-square-foot Georgian-style mansion on nearly 9 acres at 930 East Rosemary Road in Lake Forest, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The deal equates to $933 per square foot and ranks as the seventh-highest-priced\nhome sale\nin the region so far this year, trailing only a pair of $30 million-plus Winnetka trades and a handful of other North Shore megadeals.\nThe\nmansion\nincludes nine bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a conservatory, coach house, elevator access to all four levels and a dramatic bifurcated staircase. The\nKrehbiel family\nlisted the estate in August 2024 for just under $15 million, making the final $11 million price tag about 27 percent off the asking price. Akin ultimately bought it through an Illinois trust tied to a Delaware entity that masked his identity, according to the Tribune. The property spans five parcels with a combined 2024 tax bill of about $126,000.\nThe estate, known as Camp Rosemary, sits just southeast of\nLake Forest College\nand spans 8.8 acres assembled over decades. Akin already received permission from city officials to begin limited interior demolition to assess the scope of renovations and hired Libertyville-based Landmark Luxury Group, led by Zoran Mijatovic, as general contractor. He is also working with what he described to city officials as a \u201ccelebrated U.K. garden designer\u201d to enhance the property\u2019s extensive grounds.\nAkin wrote in a Nov. 25 email to city officials that he intends to preserve and elevate the estate\u2019s landscaping.\nThe mansion was built in the early 1900s for retail magnate John T. Pirie Sr. and designed by noted architect Benjamin Marshall. Its original gardens were laid out in the 1920s by prominent landscape architect Rose Standish Nichols. Over the decades, the home passed through a roster of prominent owners, including Laurance H. Armour Jr. of the Armour meatpacking family.\nThe most recent longtime owner, the late Kennetha Love \u201cPosy\u201d Krehbiel, held the estate for 34 years. She and her then-husband, former Molex co-Chairman John H. Krehbiel Jr., bought the property in 1988 for nearly $2 million, when it totaled less than 5 acres.\nIn the 1990s, they expanded the grounds by acquiring adjacent parcels and added a substantial expansion in 1996 designed by architect Thomas Beeby, along with a pool house and guesthouse. Today, the gardens feature 21 distinct outdoor \u201crooms,\u201d bent grass lawns, hedges, manicured trees and seasonal beds.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Portland achieved something San Francisco has spent years promising and failing to do: It delivered a significant amount of\n\u201cmissing middle\u201d housing\n.\nPortland\npermitted about 2,200 townhomes, duplexes and similar small-scale multifamily units from 2021 through 2024, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. San Francisco approved roughly one-sixth as many in that time, despite comparable scarcity of these types of homes and increasing housing prices\npush\ning out residents.\nIn Portland, this missing middle housing has created a tier of for-sale product priced hundreds of thousands of dollars below the market rate for detached single-family houses.\nIn San Francisco, starter homes and condos surge further and further out of reach, weighed down by high land costs, ballooning homeowners\u2019 association fees and a permitting process that can drag on for years.\nBoth cities pursued similar zoning reforms meant to break the single-family mold. Oregon\neffectively ended single-family zoning in 2019, and Portland implemented it in 2021 as the Residential Infill Project. That law, like California\u2019s\nSenate Bill 9\n, passed in 2021,\nallows owners to split lots\nand build duplexes on single-family parcels. Portland\nexpanded\nthe law in 2022 to allow for even more housing types.\nUnlike the Oregon law, California requires anyone dividing a lot to live there for at least three years. These owner-occupancy requirements scared off developers in San Francisco and proved too complex for most homeowners, the outlet said.\nSan Francisco added more hurdles, including a holding period before approvals, which invites appeals and neighborhood pushback. Even projects theoretically eligible for streamlined review can get snagged by the city\u2019s dense web of building codes, fees and design requirements.\nCity leaders in Portland, meanwhile, resisted homeowner pressure to water down the rules and instead leaned into density, tying allowable building size to the number of units produced.\nSmaller units led to lower prices, and by-right approvals guaranteed speed and certainty that the projects will actually get built.\nPortland also simplified its code and temporarily suspended some fees, making construction more feasible for builders. The result has been a surge in townhomes and cottage clusters in Portland. Developers can now move from permit to sale in a matter of months, according to the outlet.\n\u201cIn Portland, we\u2019re just trying not to become San Francisco,\u201d Tina Kotek, then-speaker for the Oregon House of Representatives,\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times in 2019. Kotek was elected governor of Oregon in 2022.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A double-wide townhouse in Greenwich Village claimed that title last year when it sold for\n$73 million\n.\nThe deal also comes as wealthy buyers have pushed condo prices to new heights downtown.\nEarlier this year, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, set a new threshold for the priciest condo deal below 14th Street when they sold their apartment at 150 Charles Street for\n$60 million\n. About six months later, a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street entered contract with an\n$88 million\nasking price.\nIt was not immediately clear which units at the two-tower development were part of the deal.\nThe most expensive individual unit listed so far at the project is a\n7,000-square-foot duplex penthouse asking $80 million\nin the building\u2019s west tower, according to an offering plan filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. Unit 30, the development\u2019s largest, is also asking $75 million.\nThe project is expected to have a projected sellout well over $2 billion.\nNews of the inked deal is the first to land in headlines since the West Village tower quietly launched sales earlier this year. The developers last year tapped Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson to\nhead sales\nat the building, though the duo has kept information about its progress under wraps.\nThe\nfew details to emerge\nabout sales at the development have come from brokers\u2019 Instagram posts, including one posted by Bespoke last month claiming the brokerage brought a buyer for Unit 24A asking $31 million.\nTubb and Williamson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Daniel Straus is the founder of CareOne and president of The Straus Group. The buyer was\nGrant S. Johnson\n. The co-op spans about 3,800 square feet and has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. The Strauses purchased the unit in 2009 for $5.4 million. It went on the market in July for just under $13 million. The Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin\nand\nAndrew Nierenberg\nrepresented the Strauses.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top recorded commercial transaction was in the West Village, as the sale of the \u201cFriends\u201d building at\n90 Bedford Street\nfor about $33 million hit records. The seller was\nJeff Sutton\u2019s\nWharton Properties\n, which acquired the building in January 2024 for $18.3 million and renovated it.\nThe buyers were\nJP Real Estate Group Limited\nand\nJP Real Estate Group USA\n. Wharton acquired the property in January 2024 for $18.3 million. The building spans about 15,600 square feet, has 22 apartments and stands six stories tall. It also has a restaurant called Little Owl on the ground floor. The deal was brokered by\nMichael Sherman\nof Baseline Real Estate Investors.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA penthouse at\n90 Riverside Drive\non the Upper West Side changed hands for just under $11 million.

        "content": "Deputy Mayor Adolfo Carri\u00f3n plans to get back into real estate.\nCarri\u00f3n, who has\nserved\nas deputy mayor of housing, economic development and workforce since March, says he will revive his development and consulting firm, Metro Futures, after he leaves office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dormant right now. As of January 2, I\u2019m going to say it will no longer be dormant,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\u201cI will be involved in investing in New York City, building affordable housing with clients and friends of mine and trying to ensure that this continues to be the best city in the world,\u201d he said.\n(His work with the city, of course, will be limited for a while; deputy mayors are barred from communicating with city agencies for two years after leaving office.)\nCarri\u00f3n has worked for city and federal housing agencies, as well as private real estate firms. Before becoming deputy mayor, he was head of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. He launched Metro Futures in 2012, after serving as Bronx borough president and then working for the Obama administration in the Office of Urban Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He\u2019s also worked for the Stagg Group and CSA Group.\nAs Carri\u00f3n is winding down his time at City Hall, Mamdani is gradually filling out his team. I\u2019ve heard rumblings of a few people who are in the running for Carri\u00f3n\u2019s role, but we\u2019re still waiting for an announcement.\nThe final days of the Adams administration may prove consequential for Mamdani (in more ways than new appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board, which I heard is coming before the end of the week).\nOn Thursday, the City Council is expected to vote on three bills that set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances, setting minimum thresholds for the percentage of housing units dedicated to very-low and extremely-low income tenants, as well as for the amount of units with two- and three-bedrooms and those designated as homeownership units. Another measure would set minimum construction wages for some city-funded housing projects.\nMamdani hasn\u2019t taken a position on the bills, but housing groups have warned that the measures could hurt the new mayor\u2019s housing goals and dramatically raise HPD\u2019s budget needs.\nCarri\u00f3n said he is concerned about the bills and said, if approved, they would make it \u201cnearly impossible to deliver on the promise of more affordable housing.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t control every action of an industry and then expect that industry to deliver success for you and your city.\u201d\nHe added that he is \u201chere to help\u201d the next administration.\n\u201cMayor Mamdani\u2019s success is New York City\u2019s success,\u201d he said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho do you think will be the next deputy mayor of housing?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: As of Wednesday evening, the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, was not on the Committee on Housing and Buildings\u2019 agenda. A source familiar with discussions told me that the bill will likely come up for a vote Thursday, but the agenda had not been finalized.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says he believes he will be the city\u2019s 112th mayor, instead of 111th,\nGothamist reports\n. The city\u2019s Department of Records recently confirmed an historian\u2019s findings (and Gothamist\u2019s reporting) that the official count of mayors failed to account for Mayor Matthias Nicolls\u2019 nonconsecutive second term.\n\u2014 Ugh, it\u2019s not in your head: Everyone around you is sick. New York City and surrounding areas have seen some of the highest levels of flu-like illnesses in the U.S. since Dec. 6,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Wednesday tapped Jahmila Edwards, former associate director for District Council 37, as his director of intergovernmental affairs. He also announced Catherine Almonte Da Costa, head of culture at communications firm Orchestra, will serve as director of appointments.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$12.3 million\nfor a co-op unit at 888 Park Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op is 3,800 square feet and sold for more than double its last sale in 2009 of $5.4 million.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$32.7 million\nfor 90 Bedford Street. The West Village rental is six stories, 15,600-square-feet and has 22 units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.6 million for a condominium unit at 20 West 53rd Street. The Midtown Central condo at the Baccarat Hotel &amp; Residences is 2,500 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 71,555-square-foot, 13-story mixed-use residential and commercial building at 80 West Broadway in Tribeca. Richard Cook of Cookfox Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "When you\u2019re facing\n28 foreclosure cases,\nwhat\u2019s a couple more?\nInfamous Manhattan landlord Steve Croman has been hit with new foreclosure cases connected to 11 properties. Loan principals for those new cases total more than $55 million, bringing Croman\u2019s total defaulted principal tally up to $306 million. The most recent case was recorded Dec. 12.\nThe wave of defaults is almost entirely the work of one lender, an entity of Bellwether Asset Management, which\nbought a portfolio of Croman\u2019s loans\nin November. In some cases, the lender is pursuing personal judgments against Croman and his family, which could spell trouble for the landlord, who spent time in prison for fraud.\n\u201cThey are aggressive, they buy with the intent to default,\u201d Croman said in a text message to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cWe are paying them off.\u201d\nThe new foreclosure cases were brought by Bellwether entity Orange Owner LLC. Most of the 11 loans are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The lender has accused the Croman-connected borrowers of stopping payments, misappropriating rents and falling behind on water and insurance payments.\nIn some cases, the lender argues those behaviors justify a judgment on Croman personally, not just the borrowing entities he\u2019s connected to. Croman, like many building owners, signed guaranty agreements that committed him to covering losses in the case of certain bad acts like fraud or abandonment. Kelly Schneid of Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff, representing Orange Owner LLC in the suits, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe total tally of foreclosure cases faced by Croman now totals 32, with nearly all brought by Orange Owner LLC. The properties in the cases span much of Manhattan, including the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Chinatown, the West Village, the Lower East Side and Alphabet City.\nOne of the homes, at 7 East 75th Street, was used as the primary exterior shot in the 1990s sitcom \u201cThe Nanny.\u201d It served as the Sheffield family\u2019s mansion, the workplace of protagonist Fran Fine, played by Fran Drescher. An entity connected to Croman bought the 6-story building off Fifth Avenue for $14.5 million in 2008. The New York Post first reported the connection.\nThe lender alleges the borrower stopped making payments on the loan in August.\nIn November, the lender\npurchased 38 Croman-connected loans\n, with principals totaling $247 million, from Flagstar Bank, whose predecessor, New York Community Bank, originated the notes. Centennial Bank helped finance the loan purchase for Bellwether. Many of the properties in the portfolio include rent-stabilized units.\nSeven of the foreclosure cases were brought by other lenders. Those total $42.4 million in principal.\nCroman gained notoriety for widespread allegations of tenant harassment, landing him the designation of one of the city\u2019s worst landlords. After the state brought a civil case and criminal charges against him, Croman eventually paid $8 million to a tenant restitution fund and spent eight months in prison for mortgage and tax fraud.\nElsewhere, Croman has sued another lender, this one an entity of Dalan Capital, to stop an\nauction of his personal home\non the Upper East Side. A judge has postponed that sale as the case plays out.\n",

After selling a waterfront property in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for over $100 million, the MasTec chairman sold his mansion in Coral Gables for $32 million.\nA trust owned by Mas and his wife sold the 13,500-square-foot home at 6312 Riviera Drive to a land trust managed by attorney Richard Barbara, who is in-house counsel at the Barreto Group and CFO of Coral Gables Title + Escrow.\nThe waterfront two-story home has six bedrooms and six bathrooms and sits on a 1.6-acre lot fronting the Coral Gables Waterway. Mas\u2019 ownership of the property was previously hidden from the public. His trust paid\n$19.4 million\nfor the property in 2021, records show.\u00a0 (Before that, it sold\nfor $14.9 million\nin 2020.)\nMas often hides his ownership of residential properties.

The off-market trade has not yet been recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown. Sources said Mas purchased the waterfront lot this year and flipped it. His purchase was not recorded, and it suggests that he acquired the LLC that owned the lot.\nLuxury residential sales are up in Coral Gables. Last week, Royal Caribbean Group\u2019s former chairman and CEO Richard Fain signed a contract to sell his waterfront estate, asking\n$37 million\n, in Gables Estates.\nMas co-founded MasTec, a construction and engineering giant, and is also managing owner of\nInter Miami CF\n, the Major League Soccer team part-owned by David Beckham.

        "content": "As municipalities across Greater Los Angeles work to meet their housing goals, the\nInland Empire\nis in a notably healthier position for growth.\nWhile Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties deal with undersupplied multifamily rental markets, the I.E. is thriving by comparison, L.A. Business First\nreported\n, citing real estate experts at this month\u2019s\nCasden Multifamily Forecast\nand Conference held by the University of Southern California Lusk Center for Real Estate.\nOver the next two years, multifamily rents and vacancies are expected to rise across the region. Average rents in the I.E. are expected to climb 4.6 percent in that same period. Still, they will remain the most affordable market in the region, according to Moussa Diop, an associate professor of real estate at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy.\nThis year, monthly rents in the Inland Empire averaged $2,112, approximately 10 percent lower than Los Angeles County\u2019s average and 25 percent below Orange County\u2019s. The I.E., consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, has seen about 3.6 percent annual growth in rent over the past five years. Vacancy in the I.E. is the highest in the region at 6.4 percent, though it\u2019s predicted to fall in the coming quarters as demand gobbles up the\nhousing supply\n.\n\u201cThe current very high vacancy is not really something that\u2019s negative in any way,\u201d Diop said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you expect with supply in a responsive market. You need to allow time for the additional supply to be absorbed, and then new development will take place.\u201d\nLos Angeles County\u2019s rental market is \u201cchronically undersupplied,\u201d according to Diop, as years of floundering construction leaves vacancy hovering around 5 percent despite a recent increase in new construction. Average rent in L.A. County rose 0.5 percent to $2,336 per month as rental inventory across the county grew by 1 percent. As of October, the vacancy rate was approximately 5.4 percent. By October 2027, vacancy is expected to fall slightly to 5.2 percent with rents averaging $2,350 a month. Rents will only grow by 0.6 percent over the next two years.\nFinancing for new projects remains the largest hurdle for many developers in Southern California to overcome. Diop credited increasing federal debt,\nelevated interest rates\nand a stock market bubble fueled by artificial intelligence investment as key obstacles to getting shovels in dirt. These issues plague cities across the country.\n\u201cTo cover the shortfall nationally, we will need to increase supply by close to 25 percent to 30 percent annually. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Diop said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to build housing that fast. We need to understand that this is all about regulations. We have regulated our cities and ourselves into this crisis, and the only way to solve this is by changing those regulations.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The NFL\u2019s Chicago Bears are now running the triple option in their drive to score taxpayer financing for a new stadium.\nThe football team is reviving a familiar threat: leave Illinois if taxpayers won\u2019t help pay for a\nnew stadium\n. This time, the team is dangling northwest Indiana as a potential landing spot, openly pitting state and local governments against each other in a bid to extract its ideal public funding package.\nIn an\ninterview\nwith the Chicago Tribune, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the team is looking across state lines as frustration grows over stalled legislation tied to a proposed stadium at\nArlington Park in Arlington Heights\n, a northwest suburb of Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at opportunities that may exist in the Chicagoland area including northwest Indiana,\u201d Warren said, while stressing that \u201cArlington Park is the most viable location in Cook County.\u201d\nIndiana lawmakers have already laid groundwork. Earlier this year, the state created the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Commission to lure a major franchise.\nHammond Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. didn\u2019t hide his enthusiasm: \u201cI would bend over backwards to do anything I can to help the Bears come here,\u201d he told the newspaper, even suggesting the city would \u201cknock down buildings\u201d to make room for an NFL stadium.\nIllinois officials weren\u2019t amused. Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s office called the Indiana consideration \u201ca startling slap in the face\u201d of fans who have supported the team through a so-far successful season. The governor\u2019s spokesperson Matt Hill added that while the Bears are a private business, \u201cthe bottom line for any private business development should not come at the full expense of taxpayers.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s original plan for an enclosed stadium at Arlington Heights involved a $2 billion-plus private commitment. This was followed by a brief pivot, with officials proposing a $4.7 billion new domed stadium on the lakefront to replace its current home venue, Soldier Field. After state leaders took a pass on funding for the lakefront proposal, Warren confirmed the team\u2019s primary focus had returned to the Arlington Heights site.\nAt the heart of the standoff is\nlegislation\nthe Bears want to revive that would allow \u201cmegaprojects\u201d to negotiate long-term property tax payments directly with local taxing bodies. Chicago-area lawmakers have balked, particularly as the team eyes a suburban move and continues to pay just $7 million a year in rent for\nSoldier Field\n, which still carries more than $500 million in publicly financed renovation debt.\nThe Bears insist the legislation would cost the state nothing, but Pritzker has made clear the team \u2014 valued at nearly $9 billion \u2014 should fund its own stadium, with the state potentially helping on infrastructure. Arlington Heights alone would require an estimated\n$855 million\nin road and utility work, should it get the team.\nFrom a negotiating standpoint, the Indiana gambit is textbook. NFL teams have long used relocation threats to juice public subsidies, and Warren denied it\u2019s a ploy. Still, the risks are real. A move out of Illinois could dent local political goodwill, alienate fans and complicate media narratives \u2014 even if the team argues that northwest Indiana remains part of its \u201chome marketing area\u201d for TV and radio rights.\nPolls already show Chicago-area residents want the Bears to stay inside Cook County, just not on their dime. Crossing state lines might unlock more taxpayer cash, but it could come at the cost of civic loyalty and long-term brand equity \u2014 a tradeoff that doesn\u2019t show up neatly in a stadium financing spreadsheet.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

        "content": "A sprawling Lake Bluff waterfront estate finally traded after years of listings, closing a long and winding saga with a nearly $11.3 million deal.\nThe property at 700 Crab Tree Lane sold after seven years on and off the market, marking the eighth Chicago-area home to trade above $10 million this year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That tally trails only 2022, when nine homes crossed the $10 million mark \u2014 and 2025 could still match it, with a $12.5 million\nMichigan Avenue condo\nowned by Ken Griffin recently going under contract.\nThe sale caps a record year for high-end housing across the metro. It was the region\u2019s 153rd home sale at $4 million or more, blowing past the previous record of 136 set in 2022. Before 2020, the average annual count at that price tier was just 52, showing how dramatically the top end of the market has reset with an increase in volume.\nThe deal is especially notable for\nLake Bluff\n. It\u2019s the village\u2019s highest home sale since 2007, when the 21-acre Lansdowne estate sold to a developer that later subdivided it. In recent years, Lake Bluff\u2019s top sale was $7.65 million, paid in 2022 for a newly built home on the former Lansdowne grounds.\nThe sellers, James and Lisa Zenni, first listed the roughly 10,000-square-foot mansion on 13 acres\nin 2018\nfor $19.5 million. In 2023, they expanded the\noffering\nto roughly 30 acres and raised the asking price to $22.9 million. The final sale, for $11.25 million, came with about 26 acres, according to the listing, at less than half the peak asking price.\nBuilt in 1994, the Italian villa\u2013style home sits on 690 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and includes a vineyard, stable, tennis court and swimming pool. The mansion occupies land once part of the historic Crab Tree Farm, a 370-acre dairy operation dating back to 1906.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Alex Perry of Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates handled the listing. The estate had been listed at $35 million, and traded for about 13 percent less than its asking price. That asking price had briefly earned it the title of the\nmost expensive home\npublicly marketed in Texas.\nThe three-story mansion hit the market on Oct. 31 and quickly became one of Dallas\u2019 highest-profile luxury listings. The property penciled out to roughly $2,346 per square foot, placing it among the most expensive homes ever listed in the city. Even at the final sale price, the deal ranks near the top of recent Park Cities trades.\nBuilt in 1927, the mansion sits on nearly 2 acres \u2014 a rare spread even in\nVolk Estates\n, an enclave known for estate-sized lots and old guard wealth. The home includes five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half-bathrooms, with recent updates led by Dallas-based Sebastian Construction Group. The renovation was geared to modernize the interiors, while preserving the home\u2019s historic architecture.\nThe grounds aim to mimic a private resort. Amenities include layered gardens and courtyards, a resurfaced and retiled pool, a full tennis court, a putting green and multiple reworked patios anchored by a two-story cabana. A private gym was also completely overhauled, bringing the compound in line with current ultra-luxury expectations.\nThe property was previously owned by a trust headed by\nJoshua Pack\n, co-CEO of Dallas-based Fortress Investment Group, who died in September at age 51. The buyer was a local family, Perry said, declining to identify them.\nVolk Estates properties\nrarely trade\n, and when they do, they tend to set benchmarks for the region\u2019s luxury market. Dallas Central Appraisal District records show annual property taxes for the mansion are north of $252,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Tell them you think there\u2019s a corpse.\u201d\nWhen someone dies in a home, the police stay with the body until an authorized entity removes it. Usually it\u2019s a funeral home called by the family. But for a tenant without any relatives to step up, the Office of Medical Examiner does the deed.\nFor the landlord, that\u2019s the easy part. The hard part is getting the apartment back.\nLiving tenants are notoriously hard to evict in New York City. But tenants who don\u2019t have any family can cling to their apartments long after they are dead.\nIn a city with a\nhousing emergency\nand many rent-stabilized buildings in financial crisis, this stinks \u2014 figuratively and literally. The unit can easily sit empty for a year or more, providing no affordable housing and generating no rent.\nAnd because it remains sealed for months, the stench of death lingers. No one can go in even to open a window, let alone\nburn coffee grounds\nor disinfect the place. Neighbors have to live with the odor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like a crime scene,\u201d Levenson said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting the estate. They don\u2019t want the landlord rummaging through their property.\u201d\nThe government doesn\u2019t know if there are stacks of cash under the mattress for an heir or nothing but junk. But it should at least be possible to flip on an exhaust fan, spray some Lysol and dispose of rotting food.\nInstead, the police tape remains across the door.\n\u201cThen the real work starts,\u201d Levenson\nexplained\non LinkedIn. \u201cYou chase every emergency contact. Every cousin. Every \u2018niece.\u2019 Every number ever scribbled in the file.\u201d\nFor a tenant with no assets, getting a relative to take on this burden is a long shot. So the landlord has to do it. That means hiring a lawyer to go to Surrogate\u2019s Court, create an estate for the dead person and get a\npublic administrator\nappointed to represent it.\nLevenson has a Bronx case that went nowhere for more than a year while everyone waited for the court to bring in the public administrator.\nThat office then had an investigator go through the apartment. No last will and testament or anything of value was found, and it was determined that the tenant lived alone.\nThe public administrator looked for a next of kin and filed letters with the court documenting the search. This took months, as it always does.\nThat\u2019s when the owner gets the unit back, right? Not necessarily.\nIn a case like this in Manhattan, Levenson recalled, the administrator did hand over the keys at that point. But in the Bronx, the administrator refused. Levenson had to file an eviction case against a ghost.\nNo one opposed the eviction, obviously, but it still took the owner forever to get the unit back.\n\u201cEventually you get an eviction in housing court,\u201d Levenson said. \u201cIn the Bronx, you\u2019re looking at a warrant backlog of months and months.\u201d\nUncontested cases don\u2019t get priority in housing court. It\u2019s first-come, first-served.\nThe lawyer serves a 14-day notice and waits 10 days for the other party to answer. Then he applies for a warrant, which Levenson said \u201csits in warrant court purgatory\u201d for a while. Ultimately the city marshall schedules a visit to unseal the apartment.\n\u201cMy biggest frustration isn\u2019t even with the housing court,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cIt\u2019s with the public administrator. It just adds to my frustration of\nvacant apartments\nthat\ncannot be put on the market\n.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the unclaimed body sits in cold storage for a year before being shipped to Hart Island for burial at the\npotter\u2019s field\n.\n\u201cOnly in this city can a tenant pass away, go to the morgue, sit on ice for a year and still delay giving the landlord possession back,\u201d Levenson said.\n",

        "content": "The cold season came early to\nAustin\n.\nThe residential market always\ncools after the summer\n, but closings and dollar volume contracted well past last year\u2019s levels in November in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area, according to Unlock MLS and the Austin Board of Realtors. The average buyer is getting a considerable discount, and compared to earlier months of the year, supply has never been higher.\nAbout 1,900 residential deals closed last month, a 16 percent decline compared to last November. That marks the lowest total since February and the steepest year-over-year decline of 2025.\nVolume suffered similarly. Sales dollar volume dropped below $1.1 billion in November, declining by 14.5 percent, year-over-year. That\u2019s likewise the lowest total since February and the largest year-over-year drop so far this year.\nAll the while,\nsupply is piling up\n. The Austin area amassed 6.3 months of inventory in November, a month and a half more than November of last year and the highest level so far in 2025.\nSellers are also compromising more. The ratio of the average sale price to listing price declined to 91.7 percent in November, scraping close to the\nSeptember\ntrough of 91.6 percent.\nThe trend represents a drop-off compared to October, which already trailed last year in closings and dollar volume.\nPrices and sales have been faltering, and supply rising, throughout the Texas Triangle. Alongside Austin, Houston saw the greatest\ndecrease in median home prices\nin the country in September; Dallas and Houston led the nation in\ndiscounted home sales\nin August; and buyers and sellers\nfailed to close deals\nmore in San Antonio than in any other major metro in the country this summer.\nHowever, Austin had farther to fall after its\nIcarian rise\nduring the pandemic.\nAustin suffered the greatest loss in average home value in November nationwide\n, according to Zillow. The jarring shift left Austin with the\nhighest ratio of sellers to buyers in the country\nearlier this fall.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s largest industrial sales of 2025 were dominated by single-tenant logistics campuses and multi-property portfolios, with institutional investors trading heavily in Miami-Dade and Broward even as deal volume slipped from 2024\u2019s frenzied pace.\nThe top ten industrial deals combined for $822 million, compared to $1.1 billion last year, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Colliers reports.\nBlackstone was the most active seller, unloading more than half of the top 10 assets, while buyers such as Terreno, Ares and TA Realty targeted infill, last\u2011mile warehouses in Doral, Miramar, Opa-locka and Hialeah at pricing that generally held in the mid\u2011$200s to high\u2011$300s per square foot.\u200b\n1. $130.7M | Terreno Realty | Doral\nSan Francisco-based Terreno Realty, led by W. Blake Baird, paid $130.7 million for the Royal Palm Doral industrial portfolio at 6450 and 6550 Northwest 97th Avenue in Doral, making it the priciest warehouse trade in South Florida this year. The two-building complex spans roughly 346,000 square feet and traded for about $378 per square foot. Blackstone sold the fully leased asset to Terreno in August.\n2. $120.5M | Ares Management | Dania Beach and Miramar\nAres Management, led by Michael Arougheti, picked up a three-building portfolio in Miramar and Dania Beach from Blackstone and Link Logistics for $120.5 million in April. The properties, spanning 457,000 square feet, sold for about $263 per square foot and gave Ares additional scale in west Broward\u2019s big-box logistics corridor near major highways. The transaction is part of Blackstone\u2019s broader South Florida industrial sell-off, which has topped the billion-dollar mark over the last two years.\u200b\n3. $105.7M | TA Realty | Opa-Locka\nIn another deal involving Blackstone as the seller, Boston-based TA Realty paid $105.7 million for Phase II of Ironwood Commerce Center, a development site at 12691\u201312705 Northwest 42nd Avenue in Opa-locka. The trade slots in as the third-largest industrial deal of 2025 and reflects investor demand for newly built product near Opa-locka Executive Airport. Industry sources said TA Realty, led by Jim Buckingham, is betting on continued rent growth in Northwest Miami-Dade\u2019s tight logistics submarket.\u200b Last year, Blackstone and Link Logistics also sold an adjacent industrial park to TA Realty for $160 million.\n4. $90.2M | East Capital Partners | Northwest Miami Dade\nBlackstone was the seller in the fourth-biggest industrial sale of 2025. Darien, Connecticut-based East Capital Partners, led by David Archibald and Drew DeWitt, acquired Airport Trade Center at 3108\u20133308 Northwest 72nd Avenue for $90.2 million. The deal breaks down to roughly $241 a square foot for the 375,000-square-foot industrial complex, giving East Capital a large footprint near Miami International Airport at a time when infill sites are scarce. The firm financed the acquisition with a mix of equity and debt and is expected to pursue incremental upgrades as it leases up the property.\n5. $82.3M | Longpoint | Doral\nBoston-based Longpoint Realty Partners, led by Dwight Angelini, picked up America\u2019s Gateway Park, a six-building industrial portfolio in Doral, for $82.3 million in late July. Terreno Realty sold the properties, clustered around Northwest 20th Street and Northwest 89th Place. Longpoint is among the most active institutional investors wheeling and dealing in South Florida industrial properties. The firm notched the largest industrial purchase of 2024 with its $331.2 million South Florida portfolio acquisition from Blackstone.\n6. $69.9M | MIG Real Estate | Davie, Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise\nLongpoint was also involved in the tri-county region\u2019s sixth-largest deal as the seller. MIG Real Estate bought a 10-property industrial portfolio in Davie, Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise from Longpoint for about $69.9 million. The portfolio is a mix of mid-bay and light-industrial buildings spread across central Broward. The deal underscores how investors are still aggregating critical mass in Broward\u2019s older industrial complexes as development sites grow scarce.\u200b\n7. $58.9M | Property Reserve | Hialeah\nThe seventh biggest industrial transaction of 2025 involved Coral Gables Codina Partners striking another warehouse deal with Property Reserve, the real estate arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In March, Property Reserve paid $58.9 million for a 226,698-square-foot warehouse at\nBeacon Logistics Park in Hialeah\n. The trade, at about $260 per square foot, extends the church\u2019s industrial holdings in the master-planned complex, following its 2024 purchase of another building at the same complex also sold by Codina. The building is part of a larger complex planned to exceed 1 million square feet once fully built out.\n8. $56M | Ares Management | Weston\nIn Weston, Ares Management paid $56 million for Meridian at Weston, a 231,000-square-foot industrial property at 3425 Meridian Parkway, buying it from Cabot Properties. The late-year sale adds another South Florida warehouse to Ares\u2019 expanding regional portfolio. The property sits within the Weston Park of Commerce and has historically attracted distribution and cold-storage users, according to brokerage data.\u200b\n9. $55.3M | EQT Exeter | Deerfield Beach\nEQT Exeter dropped $55.35 million on a Broward County industrial portfolio previously owned by an affiliate of Miami-based Elion Partners. The buildings, including properties along Northwest 31st Avenue in Deerfield Beach, span 221,000 square feet and sold for about $250 per square foot. The acquisition gives EQT Exeter additional coverage in North Broward\u2019s logistics corridor, where vacancy is among the lowest in the region.\u200b\n10. $52.9M | Martinez Distributors | Hialeah\nRounding out the top ten is Miami-based Martinez Distributors\u2019 $52.9 million acquisition of Countyline East Logistics Center at 16300 Northwest 97th Avenue in Hialeah. In August East Capital Partner sold the 171,200-square-foot building for about $309 per square foot to Martinez. The trade highlights a recurring theme in this year\u2019s rankings: local companies stepping up to buy high-quality distribution space for their own operations, even at institutional pricing.",

        "content": "Beloved grocer H-E-B spent months seeking\napproval for its first Dallas store\n, but first it had to buy the land.\nThe San Antonio-based company overcame resident opposition rooted in concerns about traffic and flooding to secure zoning approval last week to build a 127,000-square-foot store at Hillcrest Road and LBJ Freeway.\nBut, H-E-B didn\u2019t buy just land for the store. It bought a whole office campus. That office campus used to belong to Gerald Haddock\u2019s Silver Star Properties.\nIn the first quarter, H-E-B purchased Commerce Plaza Hillcrest, a three-building office property at 12800-12890 Hillcrest Road, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The 204,650-square-foot Commerce Plaza Hillcrest was built in 1972 and sits on nearly 10 acres. It was valued at $16.8 million in 2025.\nThe deal marks one of the region\u2019s top office purchases of the year, but the purchase was the easy part for H-E-B, led by Chairman Charles Butt. The zoning fight was the challenge. Homeowner groups rallied against the project, calling the store \u201c\nout of character\n\u201d with the area. H-E-B prevailed, and the store is expected to open in 2028.\nThe transaction is a win for the Houston-based real estate investment trust, Silver Star Properties, which has been offloading its portfolio of Class B office properties as it attempts to\nright the ship\namid a bitter proxy war with ex-CEO Allen Hartman.\nSilver Star defaulted on a $259 million CMBS loan from Goldman Sachs in October 2023. Hartman was ousted the same year following accusations of nepotism and mismanagement. He denies the allegations.\nHaddock spearheaded an effort to sell off Silver Star\u2019s 35-property portfolio of low to mid-tier office properties and pivot to self-storage. It\u2019s not been easy. A Silver Star subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in 2023. In August, the firm faced\nforeclosure on three office properties\nin Houston, Dallas and San Antonio backing a $57.8 million loan from Benefit Street Partners.\nH-E-B has been on a different mission this year. It spent the year colonizing Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s northern fringe, buying land for stores in cities like\nSherman\n, where it picked up 20 acres at the northwest corner of FM 1417 and U.S. Route 75 in June.\n",

        "content": "Helm Equities\u2019\nLive Local Act\nproject in the Miami Design District scored approval, despite some city review board members expressing unease with the tower\u2019s design.\nOn Wednesday, the Miami Urban Development Review Board passed\nHelm\u2019s proposal\nwith some recommended design tweaks.\nIt also approved Namdar Group\u2019s 1,011-unit multifamily tower in Brickell, with some discussion over the neighborhood\u2019s increasing traffic congestion.\nThe board also approved Crescent Heights\u2019 second phase to its Forma apartment tower in Edgewater, with most on the committee speaking positively about the project.\nNew York-based Helm, an affiliate of JEMB Realty, garnered the most debate among board members. Designed by Cube 3, the project will consist of a 36-story tower with 278 residential units and an adjacent eight-story building with over 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a nearly 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.\nOut of the 278 units, about 116 will be apartments for rent at workforce rates, and the rest will be condos for sale at market rates. That aligns with Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, which requires at least 40 percent of units be reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The balance of residences can be either market-rate apartments or condos.\nIn exchange, Live Local Act project developers can build bigger projects than allowed on a site\u2019s zoning or receive\nbig tax breaks\n.\nBoard member Gia Zapattini said the design looks complicated.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in this project. There\u2019s curves and arches. I understand you are trying to do something unique for the Design District and trying to do something cool,\u201d she told the architect during the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated little project.\u201d\nThe mix of workforce rentals and high-end condos in one building adds to the complexity, Zapattini said. She encouraged Helm and Cube 3 to simplify the project, arguing that it will be costly and difficult to develop a building as \u201cornamental\u201d as the one shown on renderings.\n\u201cThis is a very tricky project to build,\u201d she said.\nBut others gushed over the design. Board member Ignacio Permuy said the tower has \u201ca lot of things going on \u2026 that are very, very good,\u201d and board member Francisco Perez-Azua said the project is \u201ca bit eclectic\u201d and has \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\u201cBut I see the value in that and the interest of that. I think it\u2019s a nice project,\u201d Perez-Azua said.\nThe board voted in favor of Helm\u2019s project, with recommendations that the firm tweak the fa\u00e7ade in places to give it some variation and also tweak the renderings so they\u2019re more truthful to floor plans.\nNamdar Realty, a Great Neck, New York-based firm, plans a 42-story tower, also under the Live Local Act, at 250 and 296 Southwest Seventh Street. Designed by Behar Font &amp; Partners, the tower will include 405 apartments at workforce rents designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nThe project yielded some discussion about Brickell\u2019s ever-worsening traffic and also about the tower\u2019s garage.\nCrescent Heights\u2019 Arquitectonica-designed project in\nEdgewater\nsailed past the board. Miami-based Crescent \u2013\u2013 led by Sonny Kahn, Russell Galbut and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 wants to build a 42-story, 360-unit multifamily building and an adjacent six-story commercial building with retail and office uses at 200 Northeast 30th Street.

Ten units are left for sale, ranging from $6.5 million to a penthouse asking $22 million.\nCervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing of the project.\nA CMC affiliate secured\n$239 million in financing\nfrom Bank OZK two years ago. The completion is a clincher in a 10-year legal\nbattle\nthat\u2019s still playing out in court.\nResident associations re-filed a lawsuit against the city of Miami in January, when the project was well under construction, claiming the development is illegal because the city improperly granted development permits without required land platting on the private island.\nThe developer demolished a residents\u2019 club with a hotel, restaurant, pool and tennis courts to build the condominium, and the lawsuit claimed homeowners were stripped of their use of the club, which they were required to join.\nSettlements related to that claim\nin 2020 helped the developer move forward.\nBesides that, the development pushes the number of residential units on Grove Isle to 589, exceeding the 575-unit cap established in a 1977 covenant signed by the island\u2019s original developers, the lawsuit claimed.\nLoss of unobstructed bay views and possible loss of property values for Grove Isle homeowners are at the heart of the backlash. David Winker, attorney for the homeowners,\ntold\nCoconut Grove Spotlight in February that the project lacks \u201csetbacks or other elements that would come along with platting.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s the only luxury condo building delivered in Coconut Grove this year, according to the release. The homes are attracting domestic buyers, including residents of nearby estate homes who are downsizing to low-maintenance properties, the release said.\nThe project\u2019s large floorplans and finishouts chosen under the eye of Colombo himself are among the selling points, the release said.\nColombo\u2019s condo development work started in the early 1990s with Bristol Tower and Santa Maria in Brickell. His firm is known for projects including Porto Vita, Grovenor House, Epic Hotel &amp; Residences and Brickell Flatiron.\nThe firm only develops two projects at a time, and the next one is the nearby\nFour Seasons Private Residences Coconut Grove\n, in partnership with Fort Partners.\n",

        "content": "A $10 million infusion from Penny Pritzker\u2019s foundation will help build 125 affordable homes in Chicago Lawn and kickstart more construction down the line.\nThe Pritzker Traubert Foundation awarded the $10 million Chicago Prize on Tuesday to Reclaiming Chicago, a coalition of nonprofit developers with the goal to build 2,000 affordable homes in the\nSouth\nand\nWest sides\n. The foundation is led by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Chicago real estate veteran\nPenny Pritzker\nand her husband, Bryan Traubert.\nThe grant money will fund the purchase of a 17-acre lot at 74th Street and Talman Avenue, and contribute to a $42 million revolving loan fund to finance the planned 125 affordable homes on that site along with future construction. The project will include a combination of single-family homes and two-flats.\nThe award is the third cycle of the\nChicago Prize\n, an initiative launched in 2019 to spur economic development in Chicago\u2019s South and West sides. It\u2019s the first time the prize has funded building affordable homes in Chicago\u2019s working-class neighborhoods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for people to create economic wealth when they\u2019re starting at a low income level,\u201d said Cindy Moelis, president of the Pritzker Traubert Foundation.\u00a0 \u201cThis project is trying to get housing built for less money, as well as getting families into affordable homes.\u201d\nThe donation will help speed up the construction process for the Chicago Lawn site, said Richard Townsell, the executive director of Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, one of the groups behind Reclaiming Chicago.\n\u201cAny time you can get that amount of money that you don\u2019t have to borrow, it makes a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cI can move at a speed and at a pace that I wouldn\u2019t if I had to go through banks and layers of bureaucracy at the city.\u201d\nThe award plan requires the group to begin construction at the site within 18 months, and the group has agreed to complete 100 homes within five years of the award, Moelis said.\nReclaiming Chicago has been at work since 2021, and has already built about 90 homes on previously empty city lots elsewhere, with about 75 under construction. The large lot for the 74th and Talman development will help consolidate construction costs, said Jeff Bartow, executive director of the Southwest Organizing Project, which is leading the effort alongside The Resurrection Project.\n\u201cIt provides an ability to move more efficiently and economically because of the scale,\u201d Bartow said.\nBridging the gap\nReclaiming Chicago is confronting a challenge that makes private development for single-family homes on the South Side difficult: homes generally can\u2019t sell for more than it costs to build them.\nThe group is expecting construction for each home to cost between $400,000 and $450,000, Chicago Prize senior advisor Teresa Prim said. Once constructed, they will be sold to people making between 80 to 120 percent of the area median income with a target price between $260,000 and $280,000, Prim said. The two-flats will be sold for $390,000.\n\u201cThis provides opportunities for families to build equity, to build wealth, and it\u2019s great for our neighborhoods,\u201d Bartow said.\nReclaiming Chicago is taking advantage of state subsidies to cover those costs, and Townsell said he hopes their project can serve as an example to attract more private development in the area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost doing a proof of concept that this can be done, so that we can attract some of the larger national builders to come back to Chicago and build at scale,\u201d Townsell said.\nBeyond the initial project in Chicago Lawn, the Chicago Prize will add to an existing loan fund designed to recycle its capital from sales to build more homes. Reclaiming Chicago borrows from the fund to finance construction and repays the loans when homes are sold. The income from those sales will go back into the fund to finance future projects.\nBringing down costs\nReclaiming Chicago is also lobbying for policy changes that will bring down construction costs and make the affordable homes it\u2019s building more feasible. City policies that slow down constructions are one of the major barriers to affordable homebuilding, Townsell said.\nMembers of the coalition have been involved in city initiatives like\nCut the Tape\naimed at speeding up the building process.\n\u201cThe goal of (Reclaiming Chicago) is really to advocate for policy changes that are going to help not just them, but other builders and other community leaders and developers build affordable homes faster and cheaper,\u201d Pritzker Traubert Foundation director of community investment Kareeshma Ali said.\nReclaiming Chicago is led by United Power for Action and Justice and includes the Southwest Organizing Project, The Resurrection Project, Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, the Hope Center Foundation, and Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation. The coalition was chosen for the Chicago Prize from among four finalists, which included proposals in North Lawndale, Pullman/Roseland and Bronzeville.\n",

        "content": "A former partner at one of real estate\u2019s most well-known law firms is accusing the top litigator of lying about the company\u2019s financial health and withholding millions in wages.\nEric Herschmann, who left Kasowitz LLP this year, filed a lawsuit this week in New York State Supreme Court. In the complaint previously\nreported\nby Bloomberg Law, Herschmann alleges he is owed millions in unpaid wages due to Kasowitz\u2019s mismanagement of the company, which caused profits to collapse.\nKasowitz allegedly \u201csecretly saddle[d] the firm with huge amounts of debt to pay partner distributions,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Furthermore, Herschmann claims Kasowitz breached his fiduciary duties.\nIn addition to unpaid wages, Herschmann is calling for \u201can accounting of the firm\u2019s secretive finances.\u201d He did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nIn a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, a spokesperson for Kasowitz LLP said the lawsuit was \u201ca false document filled with inaccuracies and misstatements of fact.\u201d\n\u201cFor 30 years, Mr. Herschmann was paid extraordinarily well for relatively few billable hours and small amounts of business,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nHerschmann was a partner at the firm, long known as Kasowitz Benson Torres, from 1996 to 2020, when he departed to serve as a senior adviser in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. He previously served on Trump\u2019s legal team during the president\u2019s first impeachment trial.\nAfter leaving the White House, Herschmann was lured back to his old firm after learning from Kasowitz that the company was \u201cfinancially healthy and successful,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He was allegedly promised a role that would drive \u201capproximately $10 million per year in business.\u201d\nThis year, Herschmann and two other ex-partners at Kasowitz \u2014 including one of the namesakes of the firm\u2019s former moniker \u2014 launched Herschmann Benson Bowen. Other departures from Kasowitz\u2019s firm this year include a pair of partners who left in March and a significant litigator who moved on in June.\nKasowitz rebranded in June to remove the names of a pair of former partners.\nThe firm dates back to 1993 and counts industry heavyweights, including\nSL Green\n,\nJDS Development\n, JLL and Related Companies, along with characters like former\nDouglas Elliman chairman Howard Lorber\nand\nbillionaire developer Ben Ashkenazy\n.\nIn 2023, Kasowitz was named Practice Group of the Year for Real Estate by Law360.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "North Michigan Avenue\u2019s slow motion reset is getting a glossy new tenant \u2014 with a vault.\nJPMorgan Chase is planting a two-story Chase and JP Morgan banking center in a former\nUniqlo\nstore across from the Water Tower, doubling down on the Magnificent Mile. The 11,000-square-foot space at 830 North Michigan Avenue is slated to open next fall,\naccording\nto the Chicago Tribune. The ground floor will house a standard Chase branch, while the second level will launch Chicago\u2019s first\nJP Morgan Financial Center\n, a high-touch concept aimed squarely at customers with at least $1 million in net worth.\nChase\nis consolidating to make the move work. When the new site opens, the bank will shutter nearby branches at\n605 North Michigan Avenue\nand 875 North Michigan Avenue in the former John Hancock Center, folding those operations into the new flagship. Executives said the closures won\u2019t happen until the new branch is up and running.\nThe Michigan Avenue outpost will be one of only three co-located Chase and JP Morgan banking centers in the country, with the others in California. The JP Morgan Financial Center model launched last year in New York and San Francisco and has since grown to about 20 locations nationwide, with another 10 planned next year.\nJPMorgan\u2019s concept is to pursue what it sees as a fast growing,but underserved slice of the wealth market: households worth between $1 million and $5 million, the outlet reported. The offering sits above Chase Private Client, which targets customers with $150,000 to $1 million, and comes with dedicated advisers and broader access to investment and lending services.\nThe move also highlights a trend in how big banks use brick and mortar, the publication reported. JPMorgan has pared back its Chicago area branch count by nearly 30 percent since 2015, even as it keeps investing in higher-profile, experience driven locations. The Michigan Avenue buildout will feature upscale finishes, private meeting rooms and what executives describe as a more \u201cclub-like\u201d feel than a traditional branch.\nThe deal is another data point in the Magnificent Mile\u2019s uneven real estate comeback. Uniqlo exited the space in 2021 as pandemic-era vacancies piled up, joining Gap and Macy\u2019s among the notable departures, but it plans to return to the\ncorridor\nnext year. Since then, the corridor has leaned into experiential and nontraditional retail, from the Museum of Ice Cream at Tribune Tower to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s new U.S. flagship next door.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bloomberg is doubling down on Midtown East.\nThe media and data giant inked a nearly 500,000-square-foot lease extension at Global Holdings\u2019\n120 Park Avenue\n, locking in space across 20 of the 26-story tower\u2019s floors, the landlord announced. The renewal ranks as the largest office lease of the fourth quarter and one of 2025\u2019s largest overall.\nThe new 11-year deal replaces Bloomberg\u2019s prior lease, which wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2029, and keeps the company anchored across Midtown East. Bloomberg first moved into the building in 2011 and now occupies the majority of the Class A tower, which sits across from Grand Central Terminal between East 41st and East 42nd streets. Asking rent was $135 per square foot, per\nCrain\u2019s\n, which first reported the deal.\nThe Park Avenue renewal is the latest move in Bloomberg\u2019s\nMidtown East expansion spree\n. Last year, the company\nextended its\u00a0 947,000-square-foot\u00a0 lease\nfor the entirety of 731 Lexington Avenue\u2019s office space through 2040. That building, owned by Alexander\u2019s, is home to Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters and 7,000 of its 12,000 New York-based employees. Bloomberg also signed a lease to\nexpand its footprint at SL Green\u2019s 919 Third Avenue\nto nearly 925,000 square feet, up from 749,000 square feet at the property.\nThe Park Avenue extension comes as Eyal Ofer\u2019s firm rolls out a slate of capital improvements at the nearly century-old tower. Planned upgrades include a revamped lobby, elevator modernization and fa\u00e7ade renovations.\nCBRE\u2019s Howard Fiddle, Chris Mansfield and Zachary Weil represented Bloomberg in the deal. Global Holdings was represented in-house by Chris Roth, Craig Panzirer and Alex Radmin, along with JLL\u2019s Paul Glickman and Diana Biasotti.\n",

        "content": "Paramount Group is one step closer to being sold and Albert Behler is one step closer to receiving his golden parachute, whether his shareholders want him to have it or not.\nThis week, Paramount\u2019s shareholders approved the real estate investment trust\u2019s sale to Rithm Capital, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Manhattan-based buyer submitted\na $1.6 billion bid\nfor the acquisition in September, which was $6.60 per share, 11 percent below market price.\nSaray Capital, a Dubai-based investment firm with a small stake in Paramount, swooped in this month with an offer of $6.95 per share, according to a regulatory filing. But Paramount\u2019s board recommended the Rithm offer due to \u201cmaterial deficiencies\u201d in Saray\u2019s offer, including a dearth of committed financing.\nIn another notable vote by shareholders, a vast majority rejected Behler\u2019s\n$34 million exit package\n, deemed unwarranted by a proxy adviser ahead of the vote.\nUnfortunately for those shareholders, the vote was not binding and Paramount revealed in a regulatory filing that Behler will likely get his golden parachute as long as a sale goes through. Behler\u2019s compensation will include $10.7 million in cash, $19.97 million in unvested equity awards and $3.3 million in other compensation.\nBehler has been the CEO of Paramount since 1991. He led Paramount through its $2.3 billion initial public offering in 2014, which was the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT at the time.\nHe\u2019s been a controversial figure lately, however. This year, Paramount revealed it paid millions to Behler\u2019s personal companies and interests. The previously undisclosed payments included $3 million to a private jet company \u2014 of which Behler had a 50 percent stake \u2014 and $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services.\nIn July, Paramount revealed it was under SEC investigation related to disclosures for related-party transactions, conflicts of interest and executive compensation.\nThe Real Deal\nalso discovered Behler\npushed\nfor a no-bid security contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building, to Guardian Services. Behler\u2019s ex-girlfriend worked at Guardian and the two maintained friendly relations after their romantic relationship ended.\nThe sale of Paramount is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. Paramount controls 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "One of Los Angeles\u2019 biggest landlords is largely shutting its doors to Section 8 renters, according to a new investigation.\nJamison\nroutinely rejected tenants using federal housing vouchers at many of its buildings, Capital &amp; Main\nreported\n. The findings say Jamison violated state law, which bars discrimination against Section 8 voucher holders in California.\nCapital &amp; Main, a Los Angeles-based independent news organization, hired testers posing as Section 8 voucher holders who contacted leasing agents at 65 buildings owned or operated by seven major landlords between late 2024 and early 2025. Of the 21 Jamison properties tested, agents at 15 said they did not accept Section 8 vouchers at all. At others, agents cited income or credit requirements that would effectively exclude voucher holders, or failed to follow up after initially suggesting vouchers might be accepted. Between 2021 and 2024, only one Section 8 tenant moved into a Jamison property, according to housing authority records obtained by Capital &amp; Main.\nJamison said in a statement that its management companies \u201caccept and welcome tenants utilizing Section 8 vouchers.\u201d The firm called some issues found in the report \u201ccompletely wrong and/or misleading,\u201d though it did not specify which, according to Capital &amp; Main.\nState law prevents landlords from rejecting tenants based on source of income, including\nhousing vouchers\n. Since January 2024, landlords have been legally barred from denying Section 8 applicants solely based on credit history and must consider alternative proof of ability to pay. Testers were reportedly told that Jamison buildings were awaiting \u201ccity approvals\u201d or \u201cinspections\u201d before accepting vouchers, but the\nHousing Authority of the City of Los Angeles\nhas no such approval or inspection process, Carlos Van Natter, the agency\u2019s Section 8 director, told Capital &amp; Main. \u201cWe would not inspect the whole building,\u201d Van Natter said, noting that the body only inspects individual apartments to ensure livability after a landlord has accepted a tenant\u2019s rental application.\nSection 8\nsubsidizes rent for approximately 85,000 households in L.A. County through Housing Choice Vouchers. About 40 percent of voucher holders fail to secure housing before their assistance expires \u2014 typically 60 days \u2014 even after years of waiting, Natter said.\nJamison\u2019s portfolio of about 6,000 units at 33 multifamily properties was largely built after 2013, exempting the firm from local rent control laws or the state\u2019s maximum 10 percent per year limit on rent increases at those newer buildings.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A data center startup co-founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is hitching its growth plans to one of Texas\u2019 oldest \u2014 and increasingly valuable \u2014 landowners, betting that cheap power and vast acreage in the Permian Basin can anchor the next wave of AI infrastructure.\nBolt Data &amp; Energy announced it raised $150 million in capital and struck a partnership with Texas Pacific Land Corporation, which is investing another $50 million into the venture, according to a joint press release Wednesday. The tie-up positions Bolt Data to develop large-scale data centers on Texas Pacific\u2019s sprawling West Texas holdings, as demand for energy-hungry AI computers accelerates, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nTPL will receive an equity stake, warrants and a right of first refusal to supply water to Bolt-affiliated projects and related infrastructure. Bolt, meanwhile, is lining up commercial partners and anchor tenants to build massive data hubs on TPL-controlled land, according to the release.\nThe deal adds a new chapter to Texas Pacific Land\u2019s unlikely transformation from a Wild West-era land trust into a Wall Street darling riding the\nAI boom\n. Founded more than a century ago, the Dallas-based company owns roughly 882,000 acres, most of it in the oil-rich Permian Basin, and has seen its stock more than triple this year, pushing its market value to nearly $40 billion, the release shows.\nBolt is pitching itself as a faster, vertically integrated alternative to traditional data center developers. The company plans to focus not just on building server farms, but also on securing power generation \u2014 from natural gas and renewables initially, with nuclear on the longer-term roadmap \u2014 to shorten the gap between demand and delivery of data at scale, according to the statement.\nFor real estate and infrastructure players, West Texas is emerging as a compelling data center market. Natural gas prices in the Permian are among the cheapest in the country, land is abundant and regulatory hurdles are lighter than in coastal markets. Those advantages have already drawn interest from hyperscalers like Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, all of which are hunting for reliable, low-cost electricity to feed\nAI workloads\n.\nTPL\u2019s business model may make it a particularly attractive partner. While it doesn\u2019t drill for oil or gas itself, the company monetizes its land through royalties, surface leases, easements and permits tied to pipelines, power lines, utilities and industrial uses. Data centers slot neatly into that, offering long-term leases and infrastructure revenue without the commodity risk of energy production, according to the publication.\nThe partnership is the latest in a sprint of multiple players through the state. Open AI\u2019s Stargate push,\nNvidia\n,\nFermi\nand others are plotting data centers in West Texas and elsewhere across Texas. The combined construction budget for new data centers in Texas\nexceeds $1.4 billion\njust for December, according to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filings, over 40 percent of the total $3.4 billion cost of new data center construction projects registered in 2025.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Asking volume was off roughly 37 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe top home to enter into contract last week, based on list price, was 521 Spoleto Drive in the Pacific Palisades. The home is asking nearly $13 million, or $2,536 per square foot.\nThe five-bed, five-bath home is over 5,000 square feet, sitting on a lot that\u2019s about a third of an acre.\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport holds the listing on behalf of a trust, according to property records.\nThe home last sold in 2017 for $8.9 million, or $1,734 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "Amidi Real Estate Group\nhas secured $125 million in financing for a newly built residential building in downtown Glendale.\nOaktree Capital Management\nprovided the financing for the 228-unit TenTen Campus at 414 North Orange Street,\naccording to JLL\n, which arranged the deal.\nThe funding injection allows\nRedwood City\n-based Amidi to retire existing debt and preferred equity and provides capital for continued operations as the property approaches full stabilization, Multi-Housing News\nreported\n. Amidi received a temporary certificate of occupancy for the building in November 2024 and began leasing this February, reaching 95 percent occupancy by the time the Oaktree deal closed.\nThe eight-story building spans 220,018 square feet across 228 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 470 to 1,848 square feet. Average monthly rent is $3,972, per Yardi Matrix data cited by Multi-Housing News. Apartments are outfitted with stainless steel appliances and in-unit washers and dryers, with balconies in some units. Building amenities include a resort-style pool and spa, a rooftop terrace, a fitness center with a steam room and sauna and a business center. The ground floor has more than 5,200 square feet of retail space.\nAmidi has expanded its TenTen-branded luxury multifamily developments across California. Other TenTen projects in development include TenTen Hollywood, TenTen Sunnyvale and the second phase of TenTen Wilshire.\nIn July, the Bay Area-based firm sold TenTen Glendale, a 66-unit mid-rise at 111 North Louise Street in\nGlendale\n, to Regent Properties for $33.5 million. That housing came online in 2019 with fully furnished units in studio, one- and two-bedroom floorplans.\nAside from TenTen, Amidi also builds commercial and mixed-use developments under its Hollywood Production Center and Plug and Play Tech Center brands. There are six Hollywood Production Center locations across the Los Angeles area and more than 30 Plug and Play Tech Center properties around the world.\n",

        "content": "Yet another ultra-luxury mansion sold in Dallas, leading to roughly $70 million in sales dollar volume within 10 square miles in the past two weeks.\nThe Sharif Family Revocable Trust, organized by local entrepreneurs Sardar and Rida Sharif, sold their six-bedroom, eight-bathroom Preston Hollow spec mansion at 1 Dorset Place on Monday to a trust owned by Tu and Alex Dao, CEO and president of Orthomed Anesthesia, according to public records.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but at the time of the sale, the home was asking $23 million. Even if the Sharifs accepted a discount \u2014 which would match recent Texas ultra-luxury trends \u2014 they likely made a tidy profit. They bought the land in 2022 when it was asking $2.8 million, according to Zillow and Redfin.\nThe sellers asked about $1,500 per square foot for the 15,700-square-foot home on an acre lot. Built this year, the home has a neoclassical style with a symmetrical design and a cut stone veneer. Less antiquarian is the property\u2019s 15-car garage. Jonathan Rosen with Compass Real Estate had the listing.\nThe Dorset Place property listed in October with a slew of other ultra-luxury homes, mostly concentrated in Dallas.\nA house on Hunters Glen Road\nasking $26 million narrowly surpassed it as the most expensive new home for sale in the state.\nLarry Lacerte\u2019s home in Highland Park\nand\na castle in Houston\nstole the show that month with listing prices of $35 million and $60 million, respectively.\nWhile Texas sellers have hung some big price tags this year, some of the state\u2019s top luxury deals closed well below the asking prices. Aerospace manufacturing mogul Guinn Crousen\nlisted\nhis Highland Park mansion for $32.5 million and\nsold it\nfor $25.5 million. Soon afterwards, the late Fortress CEO Josh Pack\u2019s University Park home\nsold for $30.5 million\nafter\nasking $35 million\n.\nBoth of these deals took place within the last two weeks, and both are just miles away from the Daos\u2019 new home.\nRosen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Texas law does not require the disclosure of final sale prices.\nSardar Sharif bought a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home at 10260 Strait Lane in September, according to public records, apparently in an off-market deal.\n",

        "content": "Land ownership around San Antonio\u2019s most ambitious redevelopment project is starting to shift.\nCity officials formally moved toward acquiring 5.7 acres of federally-owned land in and around Hemisfair, clearing a path for future development tied to Project Marvel, the mixed-use district proposed to include a new San Antonio Spurs arena. The San Antonio Planning Commission voted unanimously this week to recommend the city purchase a federal office building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard, along with two nearby parking lots at 610 and 611 Indianola Street, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe properties are owned by the federal government and were placed on the General Services Administration\u2019s accelerated disposition list earlier this year, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to reduce\nfederal real estate holdings\n. Sale prices have not been disclosed, and the parcels are not currently assessed for taxable value.\nA city spokesperson said the San Antonio City Council is expected to take up the acquisition in January, with closing anticipated 60 to 120 days after approval.\nIn a memo to the planning commission, city staff said federal employees would remain tenants in the 163,000-square-foot office building for up to five years while predevelopment planning moves forward. Any redevelopment would also be constrained by restrictive covenants overseen by the Texas Historical Commission.\nCity officials framed the acquisition as a necessary fix for longstanding connectivity issues at Hemisfair. The federal properties, they wrote, have functioned as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d that limits pedestrian and vehicle access to the park, contributing to weak investment and\nstalled redevelopmen\nt in the Tower Park area.\nBringing the land under city control would allow for clearer entry points, better wayfinding and development more consistent with the vision for a dense, mixed-use district surrounding the park.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Earlier this year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition after it landed on the federal disposition list. Former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed, noting that its eventual availability could draw strong interest from private developers.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County\nvoters approved\n$311 million in public funding for Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new San Antonio Spurs arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The total cost of the arena exceeds $1.2 billion, but the Bexar County money approved on the ballot is only part of the total pot. The city of San Antonio is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization\ncommitted\nto $1 billion toward the district.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A spokesperson for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBank OZK agreed in 2022 to provide $385 million in construction loans for part one of the project at 470 Kent Avenue. Bank OZK pledged\nanother round of financing\nlast year, including a $179 million building loan and $59 million project loan.\nIn June, GoldenTree teamed up with Bank OZK and TZ Capital to provide\n$600 million\nin financing to Related CEO Steve Ross\u2019 South Flagler House project in West Palm Beach. Bank OZK was the senior lender pledging $475 million in financing, while GoldenTree and TZ provided the $125 million mezzanine loan.\nLast August, Naftali snagged\n$675 million\nin financing from JP Morgan to close his deal to buy Eliot Spitzer and the Winter Organization\u2019s rental building at 800 Fifth Avenue. Naftali agreed to purchase the building in March 2024 for $800 million.\nNaftali signed a contract to purchase the Williamsburg Wharf site, a former lumberyard, for $180 million in 2019 and closed on a portion of it in 2020 for $100 million. At the time, the site was considered the last piece of undeveloped land along the East River in North Brooklyn.\nThe developers last year\nunveiled plans\nfor the sprawling development, which Naftali described as an \u201curban resort.\u201d Among them was a condo tower, dubbed One Williamsburg Wharf, which has, in the months since, snagged several pricey deals.\nOne Williamsburg Wharf has been battling with Two Trees\u2019 One Domino Square for the record of the\nhighest price per square foot\nfor a condo in Williamsburg. A team with Serhant, led by Peter Zaitzeff, is heading sales at the Wharf building, which has sold more than 60 percent of its units since launching last September, according to the latest data from Marketproof.\nThe developers also notched their\nfirst retail lease\nin March. Israeli celebrity chef Eyal Shani\u2019s restaurant group Good People Group agreed to lease 4,000 square feet on the ground floor with plans to open a new restaurant.\n",

        "content": "Extell Development has snagged a recent spate of pricey deals at 50 West 66th Street.\nThe latest was a $46.75 million closing for Unit 41E, according to public records. The nearly 7,000-square-foot unit was combined from two smaller units on the 41st floor, according to an amendment to the development\u2019s offering plan filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office.\nThe unit features six bedrooms and six bathrooms, along with 288 square feet of outdoor space, according to the offer plan. As has been the case with a number of the building\u2019s largest listings, the condo was never listed publicly.\nThe sale fell just short of the most expensive apartment sale recorded at the building so far. Unit 47E closed for $46.77 million in October, the West Side Rag first\nreported\n. One week later, a third unit on the 42nd floor sold for almost $45 million, according to public records.\nAll three units, the most expensive closings in the building to date, spanned 6,942 square feet and closed for over $6,400 per square foot.\nSome of the most expensive units that have found buyers still have yet to close. Unit 52E, another combination unit spanning nearly 7,000 square feet, nabbed a contract with a last asking price of\n$54.5 million\nlast December. (Mansion Global\nreported\nthis week that the deal is expected to close for that price, but has yet to be recorded.)\nThe recent deals cap off what has been a strong year for the Lincoln Square tower, which has been more than a decade in the making after developer Gary Barnett scooped up the first parcel of the assemblage in 2014.\nBarnett has since had to navigate stiff local opposition to the 775-foot-tower, culminating in a 2019 lawsuit that was ultimately\nthrown out in 2021\n. Following that suit, the law firm Extell hired to defend its project\nsued for unpaid legal\nfees last year.\nBut 2025 has seemed to make the trials and tribulations all worth it. Since starting closings earlier this year, the building is now over 70 percent sold, according to Marketproof.\nAmenities at the 127-unit tower include full-size basketball and pickleball courts, an indoor saltwater lap pool, bowling alley and sauna and steam room. The building will have another set of amenities on the 20th floor that include an outdoor saltwater pool and hot tub.\nBarnett is busy elsewhere on the Upper West Side, where he\u2019s slowly unveiled a number of buildings planned on the site of the former Disney campus.\nIn November, Extell\nfiled plans\nwith the city for a 355-foot-tall building at 37 West 66th Street, which called for 58 residential units and ground-floor retail. The overall lot calls for up to 158 residential units, indicating that more building is likely to come.\nOn another piece of the former Disney Campus, Barnett is hoping to build a\n1,200-foot supertall\non Columbus Avenue that would dwarf his and every other tower in the area.\n",

Metro\nbought the 106,004-square-foot office building at 500 South Santa Fe Avenue in the Arts District for $45 million, CoStar\nreported\n. The county\u2019s transit agency acquired the property in an off-market deal from development firm SteelWave. At about $450 per square foot, the sale dwarfs the downtown office average of $240 per square foot and the $342 per square foot average in Greater Los Angeles.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Michael Condon Jr., Pete Collins, Steve Marcussen, Brittany Winn, Erica Finke and Reif Gratsch represented SteelWave in the deal. L.A. Metro was represented by Cresa\u2019s Lawson Martin and Clayton Hovivian.\nSan Francisco-based SteelWave\npurchased the property\nin 2021 as part of a two-building, 157,247-square-foot portfolio called The Switchyard from CEG Construction for $80 million. Both buildings were vacant at the time of the sale. The post-pandemic dip in tech tenants seeking space kept SteelWave from finding tenants, leading it to sell off the buildings in separate deals. SteelWave offloaded the neighboring 51,243-square-foot building at 540 South Santa Fe Avenue\nto DTLA Law Group\nin August for $20 million, or $396 per square foot.\nL.A. Metro, a division of the County of Los Angeles, already owns a three-story, 86,000-square-foot building down the street at 590 South Santa Fe Avenue that it developed in 2019. That property has offices, a warehouse for spare parts, 11 maintenance bays for Metro vehicles, a tire shop, a machine shop and a vehicle-washing station. The\nCounty of Los Angeles\nowns 146 properties totaling 12 million square feet across the region.\nThe sale is the newest sign of continued recovery of office sales in Los Angeles overall. Transaction volume in the third quarter was up 56 percent over the same period last year, according to CoStar data. With such a significant improvement from a year ago, the market \u201cmight have finally bottomed out\u201d and appears to be \u201cback on the upswing,\u201d said Catherine Yeh, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "It\u2019s almost game, set, match for\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\nat the embattled San Francisco Tennis Club site.\nPasadena-based Alexandria plans to list the 2.6-acre property at 88 Bluxome Street in the first quarter of next year, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing two sources familiar with the matter. An estimated asking price has not been disclosed.\nAlexandria acquired the Bay Club\u2019s San Francisco Tennis Club in 2017 for $130 million. The site is entitled for both a 1.1 million-square-foot commercial project and a 1,500-unit residential project, giving a potential buyer a choice between the entitlements. Neither option would include a\nreplacement tennis club\nthat Alexandria initially promised to build.\nWhen Alexandria bought the location, the firm plotted renovating the building into a commercial project with 775,000 square feet of office space, a roughly 135,000-square-foot basement-level tennis club and additional commercial and retail space above ground.\nIn early 2019, Pinterest signed a 490,000-square-foot pre-lease to become the property\u2019s anchor tenant, but it terminated the lease in August 2020 and opted to stay at its existing offices in South of Market. With that potential tenant out of the picture, the financial feasibility of the development became difficult to overcome, leading Alexandria to abandon the proposed replacement tennis club and explore selling the property.\nAlexandria secured city approval for a version of the commercial project that did not include new tennis facilities in 2023, prompting a lawsuit from the San Franciscans for Sports and Recreation group that was\nsettled for $7.5 million\n. Still, vertical construction never began.\nIn May,\nStrada Development Group\nproposed building\n1,500 units across two towers\nat the SoMa site, becoming the first firm to take advantage of new regulations allowing large-scale development projects in Central SoMa to pivot from commercial to residential use. The entitlement calls for 785 residential units in one 599-foot tower and 715 units in a smaller 528-foot building, both complying with the San Francisco Planning Commission\u2019s 600-foot height limit for new multifamily projects. Of the 1,500 units, 150 would be set aside for very-low-income residents. The San Francisco Planning Department approved the residential plan earlier this month, SF YIMBY\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The biggest\nmanufacturing plant\nbetween Dallas and Austin traded on Wednesday for the first time since it was built more than 80 years ago.\nGlass manufacturer O-I, formerly Owens-Illinois, sold the 55-acre industrial facility at 5200 Beverly Drive in Waco to Keating Resources in an off-market deal, according to a press release. The historic property was built in 1943 for the seller, which supplied glassware for the World War II war effort and produced bottles for Dr Pepper and Lone Star Beer. O-I used the plant until 2023.\nThe 1 million-square foot plant is the largest manufacturing facility between Dallas and\nAustin\n, a vital corridor of the\nTexas Triangle\n, Keating Resources President Alec Keating said. The buyer is subdividing the 907,000-square-foot distribution portion of the building into 100,000-square-foot units for lease or sale as a multi-tenant distribution and manufacturing facility.\nThe property includes two active rail spurs served by Union Pacific; altogether, the site can accommodate 90 boxcars at a time. The property also has natural gas and electric service, clear heights of up to 33 feet, and 20 acres of outdoor storage. Most importantly is its site at the nexus of the Texas Triangle, America\u2019s fastest growing megaregion, cornered by Houston, San Antonio and Dallas/Fort Worth.\nThe sale price is undisclosed, but Keating Resources has now set a lease rate of $6.50 per square foot gross, according to the company\u2019s leasing brochure.\n\u201cWe have soft commitments on about 20 percent of the building,\u201d Keating told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThere\u2019s basically no vacancy in the Waco market because, unlike\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n, there\u2019s nobody building spec product. So we expect this to lease up pretty quickly, and there\u2019s a strong manufacturing base in Waco.\u201d\nJosh Heiple with CBRE represented the seller, and Jordan Beard with Cromwell Commercial represented the buyer.\nWaco is home to several manufacturing plants, including centers for Mars Wrigley, Graphic Packaging and Barsco. An Amazon distribution center is also near the property.\n",

        "content": "\u201cYou fucked us over good!\u201d\nThat\u2019s what one audience member at Thursday\u2019s City Council meeting yelled after the Committee on Housing and Buildings voted to approve several bills. The parting shot likely captures the sentiment felt by many landlords as well as others in the industry.\nIndeed, on their way out the door, the City Council left its mark on the city\u2019s housing market, a move that some believe will stunt housing construction and scare away investment.\nThe Council, at its final meeting with its current membership, approved a\npackage\nof bills that housing groups claim will hamstring Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing plan before he even takes office. It also signed off on the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, a measure that landlords and brokers warn will upend the city\u2019s real estate market.\nSupporters of the housing regulation bills, however, believe that the measures will better steer public financing to the types of housing most needed by New Yorkers, including family-sized rentals.\n\u201cToday\u2019s items reflect a shared commitment of this Council that when we use public resources to shape our housing market, we do so with intention, equity and real accountability to New Yorkers,\u201d City Council Majority Leader Amanda Far\u00edas said ahead of the Committee on Land Use\u2019s vote. \u201cTaken together, these bills reflect a clear principle: When the city provides financial assistance, the public should see public benefit in affordability, unit mix and opportunity.\u201d\nThree of the bills set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances, implementing minimum thresholds for the percentage of rental units dedicated to very-low, and extremely-low income tenants, as well as for the percentage of units with two- and three-bedrooms and those designated as homeownership units.\nThe Council additionally voted in favor of a measure that sets a minimum $40 an hour wage and benefit package for construction workers on housing projects with 150 units or more that are funded by at least $1.5 million in city financing.\nThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development estimates that those bills alone would cost $600 million a year (out of a capital budget of $2 billion) to maintain its current level of housing production and preservation, or result in 3,275 fewer housing units being financed if that money is not procured. During a press conference ahead of the full City Council meeting, Speaker Adrienne Adams didn\u2019t dispute those estimates, but said the Council \u201cstands with our information.\u201d\nA City Hall spokesperson would not say if the mayor plans to veto the measures, but indicated that the mayor is exploring his options.\u00a0If he does, it will be up to the next City Council \u2014\u00a0and its presumed next speaker, Julie Menin \u2014\u00a0to decide whether to override the vetoes. Notably, Menin abstained from voting on COPA, which did not secure a veto-proof majority.\n\u201cThese short-sighted bills will not only worsen the affordability crisis, but will also sandbag the incoming mayor and speaker,\u201d a spokesperson for the mayor said in a statement. \u201cIrresponsible actions like these demonstrate the importance of Mayor Adams\u2019 efforts to modernize the housing approval process through the ballot measures that passed this November.\u201d\nHousing groups argue that these measures threaten to deflate the effect of the various initiatives approved this year aimed at increasing the city\u2019s housing stock, including the just-passed housing\nballot measures\nand\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\nThe New York Housing Conference has warned that the new regulations could complicate Mamdani\u2019s plan to build 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade. Though Mamdani hasn\u2019t taken a public position on the measure, a group that supports him, the Tenant Bloc, has spoken out against the bills that set thresholds for units with two- and three-bedroom units and for deeply affordable housing.\nThe Council on Thursday also approved\nCOPA\n, which applies to multifamily buildings with four or more units that are considered distressed (defined by various criteria) or that have affordability requirements expiring within the next two years.\nUnder the bill, certain city-approved entities are given the right of first offer and refusal on these multifamily properties, meaning they get first crack to bid on the properties and then a chance to match any competing offer.\nOpponents of the measure argue that it will scare away would-be buyers and delay deals. The bill also underscores a long-simmering tension over assumptions that nonprofits, by virtue of being not-for-profit, are more responsible owners than their for-profit counterparts. Landlord groups have pushed back on this notion and argued that HPD doesn\u2019t have the capacity to oversee COPA.\nHPD representatives\nexpressed\nsimilar concerns during a June hearing, suggesting that the Council should narrow the pool of eligible buildings. The bill has undergone a number of amendments, including limiting the types of buildings eligible and shrinking the exclusivity period for so-called qualified entities. These\nchanges\n, however, failed to win over the measure\u2019s biggest critics.\nCOPA supporters argue that the measure helps level the playing field for nonprofit owners who prioritize affordable housing.\u00a0Council member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, noted that she met with various stakeholders, including the Real Estate Board of New York, which led to extensive changes to the bill. She also noted that she inherited the bill, which was first introduced in 2020.\n\u201cWe made a lot of compromises based on feedback from all of those stakeholders,\u201d Nurse said.\nThe City Council did not vote on another bill that would have limited the percentage of city-funded studio apartments in senior housing projects. Members also didn\u2019t consider\na bill\nthat would have allowed owners of one- and two-family homes to rent out their homes short-term, through services like Airbnb, without having to be present in the home.\nThe Council approved other bills followed by the real estate industry, including a measure that will allow the city to sell tax liens to a land bank, rather than a private trust. Another sets\nminimum wages\nfor office security guards, a change proposed after the fatal shootings at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the housing-related bills that passed:\nCOPA\nWhen owners decide to sell a multifamily building with four or more units that has a certain level of unpaid bills or violations or has affordability requirements expiring within the next two years, they must first notify the city, which will alert \u201cqualified entities\u201d \u2014 certain nonprofits and joint ventures between nonprofits and private companies \u2014\u00a0that the property is available.\nThose city-approved entities would then have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property. Once that time runs out, the interested qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. Qualified entities also have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nHPD will determine the criteria for qualified entities, which must demonstrate a commitment to managing affordable housing. The bill is slated to go into effect one year after becoming law.\nConstruction Justice Act\nDevelopers of housing projects with 150 units or more that have construction costs of $3 million or more and receive $1.5 million or more in city financing (not including as-of-right tax breaks such as 485x), must pay construction workers a minimum of $40 per hour in wages and benefits (with at least $25 going specifically to wages). The city\u2019s Comptroller will determine annual increases to this rate.\nDevelopers must also make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to ensure that at least 30 percent of construction workers hired on these city-funded projects reside in the city. That is less stringent than earlier version of the bill.\nThe bill excludes supportive housing projects. The Real Estate Board of New York and HPD\ntestified\nlast year that the measure would be too expensive.\u00a0Still, the measure, which was backed by the city\u2019s laborers\u2019 union, was viewed as\nmore favorable\nthan another minimum wage bill pushed by the carpenters\u2019 union.\nThe new rules are slated to go into effect January 1, 2027.\nTwo-, three-bedroom bill\nThis measure requires that, over a five-year period starting July 1, 2027, at least 25 percent of the new dwelling units financed by the city are two-bedroom units and at least 15 percent have three bedrooms or more.\nHPD can change these thresholds if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nThe measure excludes some projects from counting toward \u201ccovered projects\u201d that would be used to calculate the minimum percentages. Projects where at least 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, have fewer than 20 units, where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date won\u2019t count toward those thresholds.\nAdministration sources have, however, pointed out an apparent technical error in this bill: Rather than separating the list of exclusions with an \u201cor\u201d the bill uses an \u201cand.\u201d If applied literally, the bill would result in fewer exclusions, and according to the administration, further drive up the bill\u2019s costs (HPD\u2019s calculations are based on what they believe to be the Council\u2019s intent).\nAffordability thresholds bill\nBeginning July 1, 2027, over a five-year period, at least 50 percent of new units funded by the city must be affordable for extremely low-income households (those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income) and very low-income households (those earning no more than 50 percent AMI). At least 30 percent must be affordable to extremely low-income households.\nBuildings with fewer than 75 units wouldn\u2019t count toward the percentage calculation.\nHomeownership bill\nOver a five-year period, at least 4 percent of new housing units financed by the city must be homeownership units. This requirement goes into effect July 1, 2026.\nAir conditioning mandate\nLandlords, at the request of their tenants, are required to provide cooling systems (between June 15 and Sept. 12) to keep \u201ccovered rooms\u201d at a maximum air temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cCovered rooms\u201d apply to a tenant\u2019s primary sleeping space, rather than the whole unit. In a win for rent-stabilized owners, the latest version of the bill requires tenants in regulated units to first consent to improvements needed to comply with the measure, as well as the related charges. Those charges would be applied through rent increases, as permitted by state law, which only allows the landlord to recoup a portion of the cost of individual apartment improvements.\nCo-op timeline\nUnder this measure, a co-op board must notify prospective residents that they have received an application to live at the building within 15 days. The board then has 45 days to accept or reject the application. The Council declined to take up more\ncontroversial\nco-op regulation measures, including one that would have required boards to disclose the reasons for rejecting applicants.\n",

        "content": "Did you read John Catsimatidis\u2019\nwild interview\nwith the New York Editorial Board?\nBefore I get to that, some history:\nCatsimatidis has clashed with me a couple of times \u2014 once because I supported a bill to ban supermarkets from giving away plastic bags (which passed and has worked well), and later because I doubted he would follow through on an idea to run for mayor again (he didn\u2019t).\nCats is a self-made billionaire. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s a business savant, especially at buying companies dirt-cheap out of bankruptcy (oil refineries, gas stations/convenience stores) and making them profitable. He\u2019s best known for Gristedes, but that\u2019s not the primary source of his wealth.\nHe has also developed some large buildings in New York City, providing housing in a city that desperately needs it.\nBut his skill set does not extend to policies and politics, which are important for any mayor. That\u2019s why I found him an odd choice for an interview by a board focused on those topics.\nThe transcript was painful to read, as Cats rattled off fake-news talking points and conspiracy theories from the right-wing propaganda machine. I often write about socialist fantasies and propaganda, so you know my objection here isn\u2019t rooted in partisanship. I just prefer reality.\nBut eventually the board asked Cats about the grocery business, a subject he knows well, and he said something I found interesting: Gristedes\u2019 unionized workforce has done nothing to protect his supermarkets from nonunion competition.\nHe seemed bitter about that. He didn\u2019t mention that unions\nkept Walmart out\nof New York City, but that was\nlong ago\n. Today, several\nnonunion supermarket chains\nare\nexpanding aggressively\nhere (a\nboon\nto the real estate industry).\nBy contrast, the Hotel Trades Council\nstopped nonunion hotels\u2019 expansion cold\nby passing a\nspecial permit requirement\nin 2021. This was a pure transactional arrangement with Bill de Blasio and the City Council. Unionized hotels and their landlords were also winners in that deal.\nChampions of capitalism hate that kind of thing. Catsimatidis is certainly a capitalist. But I can understand why he wants the retail workers\u2019 unions to limit competition from nonunion chains. That is part of their job, and he\u2019s paying them. Who could blame him for wondering, \u201cWhat am I getting in return?\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nA City Council bill to allow\nhousing exclusive to artists\nseems like a bad idea. Artists-only housing in Soho was not well enforced, and the rule was routinely ignored. And the principle seems wrong: The bill would create an exception to discrimination law to discriminate against non-artists. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Any vetoes by Mayor Eric Adams of bills passed Thursday by the City Council will not be subject to overrides until next month, when the Council will have a bunch of new members and, more importantly, a new speaker in Julie Menin. The speaker controls the agenda, so if Menin doesn\u2019t want a vetoed bill to become law, she can prevent a vote to override from even being held.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe Kingston city council voted to keep rent stabilization by\nmaintaining its \u201chousing emergency\u201d\nstatus despite its housing survey last spring finding a citywide vacancy rate\nabove 7 percent\n.\nVacancy below 5 percent has always been necessary for declaring a housing emergency. And a housing emergency is necessary to have rent stabilization.\nKingston\u2019s vacancy rate is only under 5 percent in the subset of buildings eligible for rent stabilization. What typically matters, however, is the citywide rate, although the law is a bit vague. Landlords will surely sue if rent regulation continues. Is the council pushing the envelope in the hopes that a court will bless this approach?\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$46.8 million\nfor a 6,942-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at Gary Barnett\u2019s\n50 West 66th Street\nin Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $16 million for 144-32 and 144-36 Northern Boulevard in Flushing. The latter property, a 1,500-square-foot commercial space, fetched\n$11.2 million\nand 144-32, a single-family house, went for\n$4.8 million\n. An LLC tied to Century Development Group purchased the property.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$3.85 million\nfor a 3,120-square-foot house at 176-12 Kildare Road in Jamaica Estates. Leah Musheyeva with Exit Realty First Choice has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 315,325-square-foot, 156-unit project at 136-48 37th Avenue in Flushing. Frank Fusaro of Handel Architects filed the permit on behalf of Richard Siu of F&amp;T Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "South Florida multifamily landlords felt the sting from elevated expenses this year.\nCase in point: The top deal was a $235 million purchase of a Boca Raton apartment building out of bankruptcy proceedings. The seller had put the building into Chapter 11 reorganization, avoiding an impending foreclosure auction from the lender over a $145 million loan.\nNo other deal in this year\u2019s ranking broke $200 million in value.\nSouth Florida has a reputation as a healthier apartment market than other parts of the U.S. due to the tri-county region becoming a magnet for out-of-staters during the first three years of the pandemic. This created\nunprecedented demand\n, record rent growth, and hefty development and investment sales activity.\nBut South Florida also felt the pinch of\neconomic headwinds\nin recent years. The Sunshine State is battered by expensive insurance, despite some stabilization in the market in the past year.\nMeanwhile, higher interest rates made refinancings harder. After the Federal Reserve imposed 11 aggressive benchmark interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023, it cut the rate six times this year and last.\nOn the leasing side, hefty apartment completions in South Florida created a\nsupply overhang\n, slower lease-ups and increased concessions over the past year. Average rental rates across the region decreased\n2.7 percent\nin November from November 2024, according to Realtor.com.\nSome buyers still in the multifamily investment game turned to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, or debt from insurance companies, which generally have more favorable terms. Others assumed sellers\u2019 existing loans on apartment properties or closed all-cash deals. Some buyers relied on fully funded\ndiscretionary funds\n, which allow for lower debt leverage.\nHere are South Florida\u2019s top 10 multifamily deals for 2025.\nGrant Cardone takes the lead \u2014 again\nSocial media personality Grant Cardone, who also is a multifamily syndicator and proffers his 10X platform as a way for companies to supercharge their businesses, partnered with the seller of the distressed 101 Via Mizner to purchase the asset out of bankruptcy.\nThe deal saved Penn-Florida Companies, which had developed 101 Via Mizner and was facing foreclosure from its lender, from losing the building.\nIn July, the bankruptcy court approved for Cardone\u2019s Aventura-based Cardone Capital and Boca Raton-based Penn-Florida to purchase 101 Via Mizner for\n$235 million\n. The 14-story, 366-unit building is at 101 East Camino Real in Boca Raton. The price broke down to $642,077 per apartment.\nUnder the deal, Cardone Capital was responsible for $220 million, and Penn-Florida for $15 million of the price. The joint venture plans to convert the building into condos, projecting roughly $400 million in total unit sales.\nLed by Mark Gensheimer, Penn-Florida completed 101 Via Mizner in 2016 and filed for\nChapter 11 reorganization\nin January, staving off a foreclosure auction. Lender Blackstone Mortgage Trust previously had filed for a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure for a\n$145 million\nloan.\nCardone\u2019s\nheadline-grabbing multifamily deals also landed him the top spot in\nThe Real Deal South Florida\u2019s\nrankings last year and in 2021.\nFunds affiliated with Cardone Capital paid more than\n$500 million in cash\nfor three Broward County apartment properties last year. They are the 382-unit Manor at Flagler Village building in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village neighborhood; the 332-unit Edge at Flagler Village building, also in Flagler Village; and the 468-unit Laurels at Jacaranda complex in Plantation.\nIn 2021, Cardone bought a four-property portfolio with 1,688 apartments in Broward County\u2019s Fort Lauderdale, Sunrise and Weston for\n$744 million\n, or $441,000 per apartment.\nLet\u2019s circle back\nTA Realty bought a Palm Beach Gardens complex it previously owned.\nThe Boston-based firm paid\n$193 million\nfor the 476-unit San Merano at Mirasol Apartments, consisting of 31 two-story buildings on a 31-acre site at 100 Portofino Drive, in October. TA Realty assumed the existing $108.5 million Freddie Mac loan on the property from the seller, New York-based Blackstone.\nThe purchase price equated to $405,462 per apartment.\nDeveloper Kolter completed San Merano at Mirasol in 2002 and 2003, selling it to TA Realty in 2010 for $69.1 million, according to records. TA Realty sold it to Blackstone in 2017 for $103.6 million.\nTA is led by managing partners James Buckingham, Michael Haggerty and James Raisides.\nFavo\u2019s all-stock, liabilities assumption deal in Hollywood\nPrivate credit firm Favo Capital bought the 1818 Park apartment tower facing Young Circle in Hollywood for\n$190 million\n.\nLauderhill-based Favo, led by Vincent Napolitano, purchased the 22-story, 277-unit building at\u00a0 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal in August.\nSeller GCF Development, which completed 1818 Park in 2022, received a long-term equity stake in Favo as part of the deal. Hollywood-based GCF Development is led by Charles \u201cChip\u201d Abele.\nThe purchase price broke down to $696,000 per unit.\nDermot Company cashes out of Boynton Beach complex\nInvestment manager IMT Capital bought a 456-unit apartment complex in Boynton Beach for $183.5 million.\nNew York-based Dermot Company sold the apartment complex and townhome rental community at 3501 and 3373 North Federal Highway to Sherman Oaks, California-based IMT Capital. The deal, which closed last month, included a 1.4-acre vacant site at 3456 and 3466 Old Dixie Highway, between the townhome community and apartment community.\nThe purchase broke down to $402,400 per unit.\nIMT Capital took out a $119.3 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. Andrew Wizenberg is managing director at IMT Capital.\nPreviously called The Seabourn, the complex was renamed IMT Gulfstream.\nDermot, led by Stephen Benjamin, paid\n$143 million\nfor the property in 2021.\nBillionaire Zara founder invests in Fort Lauderdale\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega bought the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$165 million\n. The deal was part of Ortega\u2019s global shopping spree this year.\nOrtega, through his family office Ponte Gadea, purchased the 44-story Veneto at 201 South Federal Highway in June. The seller, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, completed development of the tower last year.\nThe deal equated to $637,100 per unit.\nOrtega\n, best known as the founder of fast fashion retailers Zara and Bershka, for decades has been investing dividends from his Inditex clothing empire into all-cash real estate purchases. His shopping spree this year coincided with hefty dividends from his retail businesses, meaning his property investments shielded some of his earnings from Spain\u2019s high wealth tax.\nAlso this year in South Florida, Ortega paid\n$274.4 million\nfor the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell, and about\n$110 million\nfor the Atlas Plaza retail property in the Miami Design District.\nPantzer family invests in Miramar\nPantzer Properties paid\n$161 million\nfor a 393-unit apartment building in Miramar last month, shortly after the New York-based family owned firm closed its $1 billion Panco Strategic Real Estate Fund VI that will target multifamily properties on the East Coast.\nPanzter paid $409,700 per unit for the eight-story building at 1-3 Main Street, and borrowed a\u00a0 $102.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. Pantzer renamed the building The Point at Miramar.\nThe sellers, Boston-based Rockpoint and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group, completed the building last year.\nChurch\u2019s investment arm picks up Boca Raton complex\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints picked up a Boca Raton complex for\n$152.5 million\n.\nIn August, Property Reserve, which invests the church\u2019s reserve funds in commercial real estate, bought the 384-unit Del Ola at 7801 North Federal Highway from New York-based Clarion Partners. The purchase broke down to $397,000 per apartment.\nIt marks at least the fourth real estate purchase by Property Reserve in South Florida since 2023. Led by Ashley Powell, Property Reserve owns the 1.3 million-square-foot Beacon Logistics Park in Hialeah, after buying it in several deals. It also owns the 315-unit Ellsworth apartment building in Plantation and the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens in unincorporated Palm Beach County.\nThe deal activity comes as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has faced criticism in past years over its massive real estate holdings, construction of grandiose temples and opaque financials, partly allowed by limited public disclosure requirements.\nTA Realty kicked off year in Pembroke Pines\nIn January, TA Realty paid\n$118 million\nfor the Pines West apartment complex in Pembroke Pines.\nThe purchase of the 300-unit property at 16700 Sheridan Street broke down to $393,300 per apartment. Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners sold Pines West, after it had paid\n$91.8 million\nfor the complex in 2018.\nWest Shore invests in Palm Beach Gardens\nBoston-based West Shore picked up a 542-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$117.9 million\nlast month, or $217,500 per apartment.\nWest Shore bought Palm Beach Gardens Apartments at 4120 Union Square Boulevard from Aventura-based Advenir. Completed in 1970 and 1971, the complex consists of 34 two-story rental buildings on 21.5 acres.\nAdvenir paid\n$97.3 million\nfor the property in 2018.\nRelated Fund Management buys in Delray Beach\nRelated Fund Management, the investment management arm of New York-based Related Companies, bought a 292-unit complex in Delray Beach for\n$116.9 million\n, or $400,000 per apartment.\nDallas-based Trinsic Residential Group sold the Mira Delray complex at 2095 West Atlantic Avenue to Related Fund Management in August. The buyer took out a $59.1 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\nTrinsic completed development of the complex in 2023.\nSource(s): TRD analysis of deals submitted by Colliers and CoStar.\n",

        "content": "A sprawling estate in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove asking $135 million secured a buyer, adding to a string of big residential deals inked at the end of the year.\nBanyan Ridge, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way, is pending on the Multiple Listing Service as of Thursday. It\u2019s listed with Danny Hertzberg, Jill Hertzberg, Nathan and Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker.\nThe trade could set a record for Miami home sales.\nThe property includes a 1920s Mediterranean-style house that was built for former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. That house spans 4,100 square feet and includes three bedrooms, according to listing information. The property also has a 5,300-square-foot, four-bedroom home that was built for the late Peter B. Lewis, the former chairman and CEO of Progressive Insurance Company.\nThe seller is the estate of Lewis\u2019 son, the late Jonathan Lewis, who was a prominent Miami restaurateur and LGBT advocate. Jonathan helped open the Grand Bay Hotel in Coconut Grove, and he owned the restaurants Toby\u2019s and Cafe Tu Tu Tango, according to his\nobituary\n. He died in 2023.\nThe compound hit the market in November, but it had\nbeen listed before\nwith Douglas Elliman agents Lourdes Alatriste and Holly Parker.\nThe property sits on a limestone bluff that\u2019s 17 feet above Biscayne Bay, and it includes a dock with a boat lift, a boat house, a pool house, sauna, spa and tropical landscaping. A 100-year-old Banyan Tree surrounds the pool.\nThe sale will likely surpass billionaire businessman Jorge Mas\u2019 sale of a waterfront 7.3-acre lot that\u2019s also in Coconut Grove to a hidden buyer for\nmore than $100 million\n. That off-market trade has not yet been recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown.\nIn a separate deal, Mas also recently sold his nearby Coral Gables mansion to a land trust for\n$32 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A judge on Thursday cleared the way for Miami Dade College to hand over a valuable downtown Miami site for use as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library, dismissing a lawsuit that accused the school of violating state transparency laws.\nThe ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mavel Ruiz lifts a temporary injunction blocking the college from transferring a parking lot at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n\u2013 adjacent to the historic Freedom Tower \u2013 to the state, the\nMiami Herald\nreported.\nState officials plan to turn over the site to the nonprofit foundation run by Trump family members to build the planned $950 million project which would entail a high-rise mixed-use complex.\nMiami historian and activist Dr. Marvin Dunn sued Miami Dade College to stop the transfer, alleging the school\u2019s board of trustees violated Florida\u2019s public records and public meetings laws when it first voted to hand over the site in September.\nEarlier this month, the board held a redo vote during a packed public hearing in\nHialeah\n, in which dozens of speakers objected to the giveaway. The outcome was the same: a\nunanimous vote\nto transfer the land to a state board composed of Gov.\nRon DeSantis\nand Florida\u2019s cabinet members, all of whom are Republicans.\nRuiz determined that the college\u2019s second vote met the requirements of Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law, curing the alleged transparency issues that tainted the initial approval.\nDunn alleged trustees failed to properly inform the public before their first vote, which occurred during a special meeting with little discussion or disclosure about the property.\nRuiz\ninitially sided with Dunn, halting the deal and setting an August trial date.\nThe foundation leading the fundraising efforts plans to raise an estimated $950 million over the next three years while Trump is still in office, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. Major donors that pledged to the effort this year include ABC News at $15 million, CBS News at nearly $16 million and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta at $22 million.\nThe foundation has already spent $400,000 paying its directors and trustees: the president\u2019s son Eric Trump of the Trump Organization; Michael Boulous, the husband of the president\u2019s daughter Tiffany Trump; and James Kiley, an attorney for the president.",

        "content": "What began as a gripe over mishandled packages inside a 1960s-era waterfront Miami Beach condo has mushroomed into a federal civil-rights battle over building safety, landlord responsibility and disability protections. Also caught up in the kerfuffle: a Labrador-mix service dog named Ella.\nIn a Nov. 26 complaint filed in Miami federal court, ex-tenants Julio Rumbaut and his daughter Sarah Rumbaut accuse their former landlords and management at Imperial House of retaliation, constructive eviction and violating federal fair housing and disabilities laws.\nBuilt in 1963, Imperial House rises 15 stories with 127 units at 5255 Collins Avenue. In 2023, Camilo Miguel\u2019s Miami-based Mast Capital sought to buy out all the owners at\nImperial House\n.\nThe defendants are Guarav Butani and Sumant Mehta, principals of the entity that owns the 14th floor Imperial House unit the Rumbauts leased; Imperial House property manager Genovev Mendoza and her employer\nFirstService Residential Florida\n; the condo association; and a contractor that performed work in the unit.\nRumbaut is representing himself and his daughter. Kylie Rae Werk, the attorney representing Mendoza, FirstService and the condo association did not respond to requests for comment. Butani and Mehta also did not respond to requests for comment.\nGrocery Delivery Snafu\nThe trouble started when Julio Rumbaut accused Mendoza of providing false information about a mishandled grocery delivery that caused his frozen food to spoil, according to the lawsuit. Mendoza allegedly \u201cbecame hostile and defensive,\u201d blaming another employee and labeled him as \u201cdifficult.\u201d\nWhen Rumbaut complained to her corporate supervisors, Mendoza allegedly became \u201cunforgiving,\u201d turning an administrative misunderstanding into a pattern of hostility and retaliation, the complaint alleges.\nMendoza also allegedly supported and praised a front-desk employee who \u201crepeatedly interrogated Sarah Rumbaut about her unit number despite months of residency and daily familiarity,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe discord allegedly intensified amid a separate set of problems related to Miami-Dade County\u2019s 60-year structural recertification of Imperial House \u2014 one of many midcentury coastal condominiums\nundergoing safety upgrades\nin the wake of the\nChamplain Towers South collapse\nin 2021.\nConstruction Dust Forces Tenants Out\nEarlier this year, Butani and Mehta\u2019s entity hired Contracting Specialists South East to perform interior work linked to recertification, the lawsuit states. The landlords pressed Mendoza to speed things along, and she \u201centhusiastically\u201d urged the contractor to begin demolition and drilling work while the unit was occupied by the Rumbauts, the complaint alleges.\nThe two-bedroom unit was blanketed in dust and debris, creating unsafe breathing conditions that endangered their health, the Rumbauts allege in their court filings. Medical records attached to the complaint claim Sarah Rumbaut suffered respiratory symptoms tied to the construction. The family ultimately vacated the condo in April, a move that the Rumbauts allege amounted to constructive eviction \u2014 a forced departure due to untenable living conditions.\nService Dog Allegations\nJulio Rumbaut also accuses Mendoza of engaging in a retaliatory campaign against him, including violating federal housing and disability laws by discriminating against his service dog, Ella. The lawsuit alleges that Mendoza exaggerated minor incidents involving the animal and sowed conflict over accommodation rules.\nFor instance, Mendoza allegedly forced Julio Rumbaut to use a freight elevator whenever he walked Ella, and attempted to have the canine removed from the property.\nRumbaut alleges these acts formed a separate pattern of discriminatory interference prohibited by federal laws.\n\u201cIn our case, that meant dealing with interference around a service dog and unsafe construction while my daughter\u2019s health was being impacted,\u201d Julio Rumbaut said. \u201cThe bigger issue is how Florida condominium boards, management companies and insurers make sure these situations don\u2019t happen to other residents.\u201d",

        "content": "Two years after snapping up a distressed Loop office tower in an all-cash deal, an Oregon investor pulled off a financing maneuver that all but disappeared from the downtown Chicago office market: a loan equal to the full purchase price.\nPortland-based Menashe Properties secured a $45 million loan from Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management\u2019s bank lending group on the 29-story tower at 230 West Monroe Street, CoStar\nreported\n. The loan matches exactly what\nMenashe\npaid for the building in September 2023, when it bought the property outright and ended a more than yearlong drought in major downtown office sales.\nFull-value financing is rare in today\u2019s office market and suggests the building\u2019s value has rebounded sharply since Menashe bought it at a steep discount, according to the publication. The tower last traded in 2014 for $122 million, a reminder of how far pricing fell during the pandemic-era collapse.\nThe deal stands out nationally after years of plunging office valuations driven by remote work, higher interest rates and corporate downsizing. Menashe Properties CEO Jordan Menashe said the market has quietly begun to shift, as\nobsolete buildings\nare converted to other uses and new office construction has ground to a halt.\nMenashe told the outlet that the firm was \u201cblessed\u201d by its timing of the 2023 purchase, landing at or near the bottom of office market values.\nChicago\nhas already seen a handful of high-profile refinancings that hint at a bifurcated recovery. Trophy assets like the\nOld Post Office\n, Salesforce Tower and Bank of America Tower have all landed massive commercial mortgage-backed securities loans, even as older, vacancy-plagued buildings continue to trade at prices that fail to cover their debt.\nThe loan for the building at 230 West Monroe closed in October, according to Cook County property records, more than two years after Menashe bought the building without acquisition debt because lenders had largely abandoned the sector.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Boeing officially cashed out of its former Chicago headquarters, selling the 36-story tower along the Chicago River for $22 million, marking another step in the firm\u2019s slow retreat from the city.\nThe aerospace giant sold its leasehold interest in the building at 100 North Riverside Plaza late last month to a joint venture of New York-based Stahl Organization and Houston developer Hines, according to property records and people familiar with the deal, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe Real Deal\nreported in November that\nHines\nwas in talks to buy the property, though Stahl\u2019s role as a partner was not clear at the time.\nSterling Bay\npreviously had the tower under contract over the summer, reportedly for $25 million to $30 million. That would have been $32 per square foot to $39 per square foot for the 777,400-square-foot building.\nThat deal collapsed, however. A Sterling Bay spokesperson said in a statement to\nTRD\nin November that the firm\u2019s due diligence \u201cdid not support advancing a transaction in the current market conditions.\u201d\nThe Hines-Stahl deal lands the sale at closer to $28 per square foot.\nThe modest price tag reflects the deal\u2019s structure, because it was the leasehold, not the land beneath the tower that changed hands.\nStahl\nalready owns the underlying property and controls it through a 99-year ground lease that runs through 2084. With Stahl now part-owner of the building itself, the complicated ownership structure could eventually be simplified by eliminating the ground lease altogether.\nAs part of the deal, Boeing will lease back about 70,440 square feet across floors 27 through 29, according to property records. The lease runs from September 2026 through August 2032, with options to extend for up to another decade. Boeing, Stahl and Hines declined to comment to CoStar. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jeff Cole, Cody Hundertmark and Tom Sitz represented Boeing.\nStahl recently refinanced its land ownership beneath the building with a $40 million loan maturing in 2031, Cook County records show.\nHines is a familiar name along the river, having developed nearby River Point and Salesforce Tower. The firm has been on the hunt for large tenants to fill vacancies at 100 North Riverside, a nearly 30-year-old building that needs capital and leasing momentum, but benefits from a prime location in a market short on newer riverfront offices.\nBoeing\nrelocated\nits headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, later buying the building for $165.2 million in 2005. In 2022, Boeing moved its corporate address to Arlington, Virginia, and said it had about 400 employees remaining in Chicago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of the world\u2019s largest insurance brokerages is zigging while much of corporate America zags, opting to split its Chicago office between two downtown sites rather than consolidating into a single hub.\nAlliant Insurance Services signed a lease for just under 27,000 square feet \u2014 a full floor \u2014 at\n360 North Green Street\nin Fulton Market, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, according to people familiar with the deal. At the same time, the Irvine, California-based firm is in late-stage talks to lease roughly 18,000 square feet closer to the Loop. Space on or near Wacker Drive is said to be under consideration.\nThe move would break up Alliant\u2019s current Chicago space of about 52,000 square feet, which it subleases from Mesirow Financial at\n353 North Clark Street\nin River North. Once the new leases are finalized, Alliant plans to divide its local workforce between the two offices.\nThat strategy runs counter to a dominant post-pandemic theme in the office market. As remote and hybrid work hollowed out demand, many companies have sought to centralize operations into a single location to cut costs and encourage in-person collaboration.\nA spokesperson for Alliant did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet, but sources said one of the firm\u2019s business units will be based in the Fulton Market office, where rents typically command a premium. Another segment, targeting a different client base, is expected to land in less expensive space near the Loop.\nThe Fulton Market lease is a win for\nSterling Bay\n, the developer of the 24-story, roughly 500,000-square-foot building at 360 North Green. Completed last year, the tower has quickly become a magnet for professional services firms migrating from more traditional downtown addresses. Boston Consulting Group and law firm Greenberg Traurig are among the building\u2019s tenants, marking an early wave of white collar firms following tech companies into the former meatpacking district.\nAlliant appears to be the first major insurance brokerage to establish a foothold in the Fulton Market corridor. Prior to the deal, the Green Street building was about 79 percent leased, according to CoStar.\nAlliant\u2019s Chicago presence dates back to its 2016 acquisition of\nMesirow\u2019s\ninsurance business. It also maintains offices in Bannockburn and Oak Brook.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller is Xiaogang Fan, a real estate agent based in Richardson. The sale price was not disclosed.\nThe 19-suite property built in 1985 sits on 4.4 acres and includes three buildings. The property also features a 0.7-acre pad that could be developed, the release said. The property is fully occupied and is home to a Subway and a My Eye Doctor office. Campbell Junction is about 17 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\nThe property \u201cmay be a candidate for partial redevelopment or mixed-use conversion,\u201d Marcus and Millichap\u2019s Philip Levy said in the release. He marketed the listing.\nWarnings of the death of retail after the Great Financial Crisis scared developers away from building new retail properties over the last decade. But e-commerce didn\u2019t kill retail as everyone expected, and the pandemic left people craving in-person experiences.\nAs a result, retail real estate \u2014 especially in a high growth market like Dallas-Fort Worth \u2014 has proven to be a popular investment, as space is limited from lack of new development and rents are high.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, retail rents are up from a year ago, increasing from $19.78 per square foot to $20.28 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are stable at 4.8 percent.\nThe market\u2019s stability means the region was able to weather the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\nand Tuesday Morning. The empty space has been quickly gobbled up by\nexperiential users like fitness centers\nand pickleball facilities. Even bookseller\nBarnes &amp; Noble is having a renaissance\n.\n",

        "content": "The Houston Rockets are lining up another big investment at Toyota Center, planning a full renovation of the arena\u2019s suites as the team continues to modernize its 21-year-old downtown home.\nAll suites at the Toyota Center will be renovated in a project estimated to cost $24.6 million, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Ryan Walsh, CEO of the Harris County Houston Sports Authority,\nconfirmed\nthe plans to the Houston Business Journal. The Rockets will cover the full cost of the work at 1510 Polk Street.\nConstruction is expected to begin in April 2026 and wrap up in October 2027, the\nTDLR filing shows\n, though timelines in such filings are often subject to revision.\nFrom a real estate and venue-operations perspective, the suite project is a prime example of how professional sports teams are investing in premium spaces that drive revenue. The outlet reported that corporate suites and high-end hospitality areas have become a focal point, as teams look to compete for sponsors and affluent fans while keeping older arenas relevant in a market crowded with newer venues.\nThe suite renovation is the latest in a string of team-funded upgrades at\nToyota Center\n. Most recently, the\nRockets\nkicked off a $10.5 million project to replace all 17,000 bowl seats in the arena. The new seats will feature black sports-weave material, replacing the venue\u2019s longstanding red color scheme, without reducing capacity. That project is expected to be completed by July 2026.\nThe team has also wrapped up a $7.5 million roof replacement, addressing another major building system that dated back to the arena\u2019s 2003 opening. In addition, the Rockets spent $22 million to install new LED ribbon boards, and a center-hung scoreboard that was unveiled at the start of the 2024 season. The 6,200-square-foot display increased LED surface area by 84 percent and added four underbelly screens, further pushing\nToyota Center\ntoward a more immersive, tech-forward experience.\nOther recent additions include the Sire Spirits Social Club, which debuted during the 2022-23 season and reflects the broader shift toward\nexperiential and branded\nspaces inside sports venues.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

She also served on the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission, which presented voters with four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, including three that created different avenues for project approvals.\nGothamist was\nfirst to report\nthe appointment.\nMamdani seems to be peeling off the economic development and workforce portions of the deputy mayor\u2019s portfolio.

That position was held by Jessica Katz, who\nleft\nafter 16 months on the job. After her departure, Adams added housing back into the deputy mayor\u2019s purview, but also\ncreated\nBozorg\u2019s role.\nMamdani also announced the creation of a new position: deputy mayor of economic justice, which will be focused on worker and consumer protections. The mayor-elect named Julie Su, former U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Joe Biden, to this role.\nBefore joining the Adams administration, Bozorg sat on the City Planning Commission and was chief of strategy and policy at nonprofit NYC Kids RISE. Prior to that, she served as chief of staff to the HPD commissioners Vicki Been and Louise Carroll between 2014 and 2020. She was also a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nIn a press release announcing the appointments, Bozorg is described as \u201cinstrumental\u201d in negotiating the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity text amendment.

        "content": "A Nussbaum Lowinger creditor is going after the dissolved firm\u2019s lesser-known partner, Samuel Lowinger.\nLakewood-based Blueberry Funding has filed a lawsuit in Kings County seeking to hold Lowinger responsible for $58.7 million in missing escrow funds. The lawsuit puts the focus on the other half of the now-defunct Nussbaum Lowinger, a Manhattan-based law firm at the center of an escrow fraud scandal where former clients allege they are owed over $400 million.\nThus far, much of the legal ire has been directed at Mark Nussbaum, the better-known and majority partner at the firm. But Blueberry is placing blame on Lowinger, alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to ensure the funds were held in the designated escrow account. Blueberry further alleges Lowinger knew or should have known that distributions were being made from the escrow account and the fund was being depleted. Prior to Blueberry\u2019s lawsuit, Lowinger had only been named as a defendant in one other lawsuit. (The claims against Lowinger in that suit were discontinued.)\nThe mystery of Sam Lowinger\nNussbaum was known as the high-rolling point person for the firm\u2019s escrow business. His personal assets included $2 million in crypto and $91,000 in wine and alcohol, according to recent court filings. He had sold over $200,000 in watches and jewelry.\nLowinger appears to keep a lower profile. His Instagram account is filled with the 30-something-year-old attorney playing saxophone solos. About a month after Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s closure, Lowinger landed a new job as an associate general counsel at a family office, according to his LinkedIn,\nThe Promote\nreported.\nHe has largely remained quiet since the firm\u2019s collapse, claiming that Nussbaum left him in the dark about the firm\u2019s escrow business and was the only one with viewing access, according to court filings.\nLowinger\u2019s attorney, Rick Supple, said his client had nothing to do with the escrow agreement that Blueberry allegedly made with Nussbaum.\n\u201cIn fact, as plaintiff also knows, once it became known to Mr. Lowinger that the firm\u2019s escrow account may have been infected by improper conduct, he took immediate action to protect all stakeholders,\u201d said Supple. \u201cMr. Lowinger looks forward to addressing and putting to rest Blueberry\u2019s false claims.\u201d\nWhile Lowinger has tried to distance himself from the firm\u2019s collapse and its escrow business, he was closely involved with the transaction side of the business, according to sources and documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. These new details shed light on Lowinger\u2019s role in the embattled firm, which has until now been opaque.\nNussbaum Lowinger\u2019s real estate clients had courted controversy, some of whom have been targets of the Department of Justice\u2019s mortgage fraud probe. Notably, Nussbaum Lowinger was listed as the counsel to Moshe Silber\u2019s Rhodium Capital. (Silber pleaded guilty last year to his role in a mortgage fraud scheme.)\nA voice memo and an email reviewed by\nTRD\nbetween 2022 and 2023 show that Lowinger had extensive dealings with the title insurer Riverside Abstract, which is currently blacklisted by Fannie Mae for acting as the title insurer on a fraudulent transaction in Troy, Michigan. One communication shows Lowinger voicing frustration with Riverside Abstract\u2019s CEO Shaul Greenwald over undisclosed fees that appeared to hold up the closing of a deal with Shaya Prager.\n(Riverside Abstract has not been accused of any wrongdoing. There is no indication Lowinger\u2019s communications involve the Troy deal.)\nIn a March 2022 email, Lowinger wrote to Greenwald expressing his frustration with the title insurer for allegedly imposing last-minute fees on clients on time-of-the-essence deals.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t continue. If you value our relationship and team approach (and you indicated as much when you came down to our office), then there needs to be more transparency. This consistently gets in the way of TOE closings. In time of need, I feel your employees spending more time on settling your accounts rather than doing the title work we have entrusted them with.\u201d\nIn a terse voice recording dated March 2023, Lowinger again voices concern about not having visibility into Riverside\u2019s fees.\n\u201cI can\u2019t have it happen on every deal. I just can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nGreenwald did not return a request to comment.\nMark Nussbaum has been charged by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office with grand larceny over allegations he stole $15 million of escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nBlueberry, an alternative lender, is one of the largest creditors of Nussbaum Lowinger. Nussbaum appointed a trustee to handle the claims and take Nussbaum Lowinger through an alternative to bankruptcy known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors.\nThe trustee recently alleged over $300 million of Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s client money allegedly went to the late Mendel Steiner, a 33-year old Borough Park-based real estate investor, according to a recent lawsuit. A lawsuit brought by the trustee handling the liquidation alleges Steiner diverted that money through phony escrow accounts. Blueberry alleges funds were supposed to be held in the Nussbaum Lowinger escrow account. But the firm failed to return the funds after Steiner died in January.\n",

She filed her suit after resigning that same month.\nThe request for dismissal with prejudice closes the door on any possibility of the same claim being filed again.\nWrapped up in Carrillo\u2019s lawsuit were allegations against Elliman\u2019s Altman Brothers Team, led by brothers Josh and Matt Altman, that accused the agents of soliciting clients from other agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 active listings. The Altmans were never named as defendants in the lawsuit.\nCarrillo\u2019s allegations against the high-producing team were tied to a claim in her lawsuit that Kotler was dismissive of her concerns, while also accusing the executive of repeatedly telling her to use her \u201csex appeal\u201d to gain more brokerage clients.\nCourt documents for a post-mediation conference on Dec. 1 refer to the case as settled, voiding the jury trial originally scheduled to begin in May. Details of the settlement were not made public.\nCarrillo and an Elliman spokesperson declined to comment.\n\u201cI made no admission of wrongdoing as part of the settlement and I made no personal settlement payment to Ms. Carrillo as part of the settlement,\u201d Kotler said in a statement provided to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nKotler\nstepped down\nas Elliman\u2019s Western region CEO in February to join his son, Max Kotler and brother Michael Kotler on the New York City-based Kotler Team.

He sued for retaliation, breach of contract, negligence and defamation.\nElliman shot back at Grasska that same month, accusing him of breach of contract, embezzlement, misappropriation of trade secrets and other complaints in a lawsuit of its own. The brokerage alleged Grasska had been working with what was described as a \u201chigh-profile Los Angeles real estate broker\u201d on reality TV in a kickbacks scheme.

        "content": "The longtime Southwest Michigan getaway of Lee Daniels, a former Illinois House Speaker and one of the state\u2019s most influential Republican leaders of the last half-century, sold for just under $7 million.\nDaniels and his wife, Pamela, closed Tuesday on the sale of their five-bedroom, roughly 5,000-square-foot lakefront home at 11869 Marquette Drive in New Buffalo,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The deal wrapped up exactly two months after the property hit the\nmarket\n, a quick turn for a luxury listing heading into winter in a market that typically cools after summer.\nThe sellers also appear to have timed their exit well. Just months earlier, the Daniels had tested the waters at $6.75 million before removing the listing temporarily, about $250,000 less than the price they ultimately achieved.\nThe house sits on a wooded lot along\nMarquette Drive\n, a narrow strip of homes between Lake Michigan and the Galien River. Agents for the buyers said privacy, panoramic lake views and a cabana built midway down the dune to the beach helped seal the deal, along with a glass heavy lake-facing side that blurs the line between indoors and out. The property is also a short walk from Whittaker Street\u2019s restaurants and shops, offering seclusion without isolation.\nThe buyer\u2019s identity has not yet surfaced in Berrien County records, and it\u2019s unclear whether the buyer hails from the Chicago area, roughly 70 miles away.\nThe sale fits neatly into a broader pattern.\nNew Buffalo\nand nearby Union Pier have seen a string of multimillion-dollar listings snap up this year, with several homes at about $6 million quickly going under contract, and at least one Union Pier lakefront deal closing above asking price. Even as winter approaches, agents say calls from would-be buyers keep coming.\nAn inland home on Prospect Drive overlooking the Galien River \u2014 a green-roofed retreat owned by Mal\u00f6rt-maker\nTremaine Atkinson\n\u2014 listed at about $6 million in late August and was under contract within two weeks. A lakefront property a few doors down, also on Marquette Drive, listed at just below $7 million and went under contract in three days.\nDaniels spent 32 years in the Illinois House, serving as minority leader for nearly two decades and as speaker in the mid-1990s, before leaving Springfield in 2007. Records show he and his wife have owned the New Buffalo property since at least 2015, holding it in a trust, though the original purchase price is unclear.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities\nis trimming its San Francisco holdings with the sale of twin apartment towers near Golden Gate Park.\nBridge Capital Partners is under contract to buy the Sunset Towers residences at 6-8 Locksley Avenue for an undisclosed price, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. AvalonBay listed the 243-unit property earlier this year and was reportedly\nfielding bids north of $100 million\n. The deal for the multifamily complex is expected to close in January.\nThe sale serves as evidence of a citywide rebound in the apartment market as demand for units rises. Multifamily investment volume is up more than 35 percent year-over-year, and absorption has returned to 2022 levels, per Avison Young data cited by the Business Times.\nBecause San Francisco is seeing few new market-rate projects across the city, investors have been focusing on existing properties in supply-constrained neighborhoods, such as the Inner Sunset where Sunset Towers is located. More than\n20,000 units\nin San Francisco are in a holding pattern as projects face years of delays or collapse entirely. Last year, only 1,453 residential units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Planning Department.\nBoth demand and rents have been increasing in San Francisco \u2014 a trend that AvalonBay COO Sean Breslin attributes to a surge in tech workers moving to San Francisco as the artificial intelligence sector booms.\n\u201cAI is certainly a big part of that,\u201d Breslin said in May of the\nupward pricing momentum\n. AvalonBay president and CEO Benjamin Schall told investors in September that sales across its portfolio could increase as rents and property values increase. On the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call, AvalonBay executives reaffirmed that demand in coastal markets like San Francisco is driven by highly educated, higher-paid workers in AI and related fields.\nAvalonBay owns nearly 3,400 apartments in San Francisco with a total value of about $1.2 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Steve Ross, the billionaire focused on turning West Palm Beach into a financial and tech business mecca, scored a record $772 million construction financing package for two office projects.\nThe deal is the biggest known construction loan ever in South Florida, and likely statewide. It comes amid looming questions about the long-term health and success of the tri-county region\u2019s office market.\nRoss, through his Related Ross, is developing the 23-story 10 CityPlace and 26-story 15 CityPlace on a portion of the CityPlace mixed-use retail complex in downtown West Palm. Ares Real Estate funds, part of Los Angeles-based Ares Management, led the lenders providing the financing package, according to a Related Ross news release.\nOthers partnering on the projects\u2019 financing package are Monarch Alternative Capital and HPS Investment Partners, Related Ross\u2019 Jordan Rathlev said in the release.\n10 and 15 CityPlace\nare emblematic of Ross\u2019 investment in West Palm, where he is the king of offices and has about a dozen buildings, including those purchased, developed, under construction and planned.\nAlthough the influx of new-to-market companies to South Florida has calmed compared with the pandemic-induced boom, raising doubts about pre-leasing success of many of the planned offices across the region, Ross isolated his West Palm investments from the slowdown largely by tapping his New York network to secure tenants.\nLast year,\nRoss\n, 85, stepped back from the New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, to start his West Palm-based Related Ross. The firm primarily focuses on West Palm, where aside from offices, it also has apartment and condo projects, as well as investments in the rest of Palm Beach County and South Florida.\nRoss is nonexecutive chairman of Related Companies and its single biggest shareholder.\nThe 470,000-square-foot 10 CityPlace was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, and the 490,000-square-foot 15 CityPlace was designed by Arquitectonica, with interiors by Fogerty Finger. Construction of the towers started in March and completion is expected in 2027.\nThe buildings are under construction roughly on the northeast corner of South Rosemary Avenue and Hibiscus Street, replacing a former AMC theater and restaurant space. Ross, through his Related Companies, completed the CityPlace complex in 2000 as his first project in West Palm.\nCloud computing firm\nServiceNow\n, which helps businesses automate tasks by using AI, will be an anchor tenant at 10 CityPlace. The firm is expected to establish an innovation hub and AI institute in West Palm, which aligns with Ross\u2019 push to make the city into a tech hub.\nCleveland Clinic\nwill anchor 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center that will offer chemotherapy, imaging, outpatient surgery and a concierge medicine program. The facility will be connected to Cleveland Clinic\u2019s planned 150-bed hospital campus nearby that will have an emergency department, an ambulatory surgery center and a medical office building.\nOthers pre-leasing at 15 CityPlace include assurance, tax and advisory services firm\nBDO\n, law firm Shutts &amp; Bowen and private investment firm Inclenberg Investments.\nRoss\u2019 other West Palm office projects include the 25-story\nOne Flagler\n, completed this year at the foot of the Royal Park bridge, and the 25-story 515 Fern, under development on the northwest corner of Fern Street and the Florida East Coast Railway tracks.\nIn other massive South Florida loans, Whitman Family Development scored\n$740 million\nlast year to refinance a $550 million debt on the luxury Bal Harbour Shops and finance a planned 250,000-square-foot expansion of the retail center.\nLast month, Dezer Development landed a\n$630 million\nconstruction loan for the oceanfront\u00a0 61-story, 216-unit Bentley Residences condo tower at tower 18401 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach. Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech landed\n$565 million\nin financing last month for the 70-story, 195-unit The Residences at 1428 Brickell condo tower in Miami.\n",

        "content": "Developers David Martin and the Frisbie Group are one step closer to getting their controversial One Boca mixed-use project off the ground.\nOn Thursday, the Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board backed a 99-year lease that will enable Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group to build One Boca, a massive project with 947 residential units, a hotel, and other commercial uses on and near 7.8 acres of city-owned land by the Brightline train station.\nThe 7 to 0 planning board vote means that the Boca Raton City Council will now have a positive recommendation when the proposed development agreement comes before the elected body on Jan. 6 for first reading. Should the deal be fully approved by council members, the lease agreement will be put before the city\u2019s voters for final ratification on March 10.\nUnder current plans, Frisbie Group, led by Rob Frisbie Jr. and Cody Crowell, and Terra will build 765 apartments, 180 hotel rooms, 120,000 square feet of office, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, and 2,100 parking spaces on city land north of Palmetto Park Road, east of Northwest Second Avenue, south of Northwest Fourth Street, and west of Northwest First Avenue, according to a city memo. The apartments, which would be built where the Boca Raton Police Station now stands at 101 Northwest Boca Raton Boulevard, would include 77 workforce apartments.\nFrisbie and Terra also want to build a 210,854-square-foot mixed-use project with 182 condo units on private land they\u2019re under contract to buy. The 12,315-square-foot plot of land at 141 Northwest Fourth Street, is owned by Boca Color Graphics, led by Michael A. Massarella.\nThe entire One Boca project would consist of just over 538,000 square feet of new development, which is far smaller than what Terra and Frisbie initially proposed in February after beating out three other contenders, including Related Ross, for the right to redevelop 30 acres of property that included Boca Raton\u2019s deteriorating city hall as well as the city\u2019s 17-acre Memorial Park. Back then Terra and Frisbie proposed a\n2.5-million-square-foot development\nwith 1,129 residential units, 150 hotel rooms, 250,000 square feet of office, 156,690-square-feet of retail and 3,434 parking spaces.\nWhile the size of the project was later reduced, it still generated\nsignificant opposition from residents\nwho formed Save Boca and collected enough signatures\u00a0 for a referendum that would require a special vote prior to any sale or leasing of public land larger than a half-acre. Although\na judge has blocked\na referendum on public land deals in general (a decision that Save Boca is appealing) city council members still agreed to give\nvoters final say\non the One Boca project.\nIn addition, Frisbie and Terra\nscaled\ntheir proposal back further by limiting development to the east side of Northwest Second Avenue. The 17.5 acres on the west side, including Memorial Park will remain for public use and would include a new city hall, community center, recreational facilities, a police substation, and a public parking garage that would be built by Terra and Frisbie, according to a draft of the 99-year lease. Those facilities would be built in exchange for a developer\u2019s fee that would be negotiated later, although Terra and Frisbie did commit to contributing $7.9 million in off-site public improvements.\nIn exchange for building on the east side of Northwest Second Avenue, the developers would pay the city 7 percent of the gross revenues of the residential component, 4 percent of the gross revenues for the retail, office and hotel components each year. Another 10 percent of the revenues will be paid above what the lease calls a \u201cgross revenue hurdle\u201d related to the developers\u2019 costs.\nThe lease also has \u201cstrong default and termination rights for the city,\u201d Deputy City Manager Andrew Lukasik told the board.\nThe developers have claimed that the revenues would generate more than $2 billion in rent, taxes, and more for the city, per their One Boca website. But two critics of the project, who said they were certified accountants, told board members that the city could count on less than $50 million over 99 years.\nBoard members, however, were instructed not to even consider the financial aspects. Instead, they were to focus only on whether a 99-year lease that paves the way for a transit-oriented development would fulfill the city\u2019s comprehensive plan for the downtown area.\n\u201cYou will not be evaluating the leases themselves in terms of economics, nor the criteria used to select its [developer] partner, nor evaluating the [developers\u2019] ability to implement the project,\u201d Lukasik said.\nBoard member Gergory Mitchell admitted he has concerns about the money aspect of the deal and \u201cimplored\u201d city council members to \u201cget the best bang for our buck.\u201d\nBoard member Timothy Dornblaser said it was only logical to encourage development by the Brightline train station while board chairman Arnold Sevell opined that the redevelopment of downtown was \u201clong overdue\u201d in a city that has attracted increased interest from developers.\n\u201cWe have good momentum and I think we should keep it moving,\u201d Sevell said.\nBut Save Boca founder Jon Pearlman said the One Boca project has generated so much opposition that it\u2019s destined to be voted down by residents.\n\u201cWe are in power. We are in control,\u201d Pearlman said at the podium. \u201cThis is just a show, and it is meaningless and we have the ultimate say and vote.\u201d",

        "content": "With less than two weeks left in office, Mayor Eric Adams made sure to stack the city\u2019s rent board.\nAdams announced the appointment of two new members: Lliam Finn, a senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch, as a public representative; and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative.\nHe also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one.\nIn a statement, Adams said the appointments \u201cwill serve as responsible stewards of our city\u2019s housing stock, using facts and data to reach the right decision for both tenants and property owners.\u201d\nThe move has been viewed as an attempt to sabotage Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides what rent increases are permitted on one- and two-year leases, though mayors have influenced their decisions.\n\u201cIf rents don\u2019t keep up with operating costs, these buildings will soon be in physical decline as well,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the new RGB members take into account the risk of deterioration and eventual destruction of stabilized housing when they come to a decision next year.\u201d\nTenant groups remained defiant after news of Adams\u2019 appointments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting our rent freeze,\u201d Sumathy Kumar, managing director of the New York State Tenant Bloc, said in a statement. \u201cOver one million New Yorkers just voted for a mayor who will freeze the rent.\u201d\nRidding the nine-member board of potential Adams loyalists isn\u2019t as simple as Mamdani cleaning house. Under the city\u2019s\nadministrative code\n, a mayor can only remove members of the board before the end of their term with cause, and \u201cnot without an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel, in his or her defense.\u201d\nStill, the new mayor can appoint some new members as soon as he takes office, and more in his second year. Mamdani will be able to replace four members (the chair, as well as members representing the public, owners and tenants) when he takes office. The other five, all Adams appointees, could be replaced in 2027.\nIn other words, if these members stand in the way of a rent freeze, they can only do so for one year.\nSome of the other public members have been publicly skeptical of the mayor-elect\u2019s rent freeze promise. In a November\nDaily News op-ed\n, public member Alex Schwartz (who was replaced by Finn) called the proposal \u201cmisguided.\u201d\nAlex Armlovich\ntold the New York Times\nin October that Mamdani\u2019s rent freeze proposal could scare investors away. Ahead of his 2022\nappointment\n, Gupta wrote that he was skeptical of rent regulation as a concept.\nEarlier reports indicated that Adams was considering a close ally, Douglas Elliman agent and reality TV star Eleonora Srugo, for the rent board. Srugo\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat she had preliminary conversations with a senior administration official, but had other priorities to consider.\n",

        "content": "Rabina\nlocked down a refinancing for its Fifth Avenue supertall as the 88-story cloud buster nears the finish line.\nCarlyle Group provided a $640 million condo inventory loan for 520 Fifth Avenue, according to property records. The fresh financing replaces a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower transitions to leasing and sales.\nThe 1,000-foot project located near the Empire State Building now stands as the tallest tower on Fifth Avenue in that stretch of Midtown. The property combines 25 floors of offices and 100 luxury condominiums.\nCondo sales\nlaunched in April 2024 and the building\u2019s private club, Moss, opened in November and the offices are open for tenant move-ins.\nThe developer first filed plans in 2021 for the tower at the corner of East 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, then envisioned as a 70-story building. The proposal called for 98 residential units spread across 16 floors, with most of the remaining stories devoted to office space and a suite of amenities. Those amenities include restaurants, retail space and a solarium.\nKohn Pedersen Fox is the architect on the project.\nCeruzzi Properties and SMI USA acquired the site for $275 million in 2015, laying the groundwork for the development. But in 2017, founder and president\nLou Ceruzzi died suddenly\nat the age of 64, and his company\u2019s portfolio was thrown into turmoil.\nRabina came on board in 2019, bringing in an equity contribution that helped wipe out roughly $232 million in debt tied to the project and becoming the lead developer.\nThe tower is the biggest project in Mickey Rabina\u2019s six-decade career. Rabina is a familiar name among real estate\u2019s top dealmakers \u2014 in part for his reputation as a fix-it guy. When Ceruzzi died, it seemed the project might never get off the ground.\nRabina declined to comment. Carlyle did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Hines is facing criticism from tenants in\nPasadena\nless than a year after it became the owner of an 140-unit apartment complex.\nOn Wednesday, members of the Pasadena Gateway Villas Tenants Association said they have faced multiple junk fees at the Pasadena Gateway Villas after the Houston-based firm acquired the property in March, Pasadena Now\nreported\n.\nTenants allege that under Hines\u2019 ownership, they were subjected to new fees, reduced services and retaliatory treatment by the real estate firm. Residents say management pressured them to sign new leases that force them to pay for previously included amenities, such as parking, pest control, trash collection, hot water and package delivery.\nThe tenants association members, representing 34 households at the 290 North Hudson Avenue complex, said they have started paying an additional $400 to $500 per month in new fees, as well as rent increases between 8 percent and 20 percent. The residents claim the move is Hines\u2019 way of skirting California\u2019s cap on annual rent increases, generally limited to 10 percent per year.\n\u201cBefore Hines took over ownership and management of the building, housing here was stable and predictable,\u201d eight-year resident Terey Ross said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference, per Pasadena Now. Ross claims tenants were given little notice of the new lease terms and felt cornered into signing the new agreements without enough time to review them. \u201cTenants are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for lawful rental practices, transparency, and for housing terms not to be unilaterally changed,\u201d Ross said.\nIn response to tenants\u2019 claims, Marisa Monte-Santoro, Hines\u2019 public relations director, told Pasadena Now that answers about the allegations are forthcoming.\nHines purchased the Pasadena Gateway Villas from Washington Capital Management in March for $60 million, or $428,571 per unit. That figure made it the\npriciest sale in Pasadena\nin the first three quarters of the year, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data. More than 40 entities submitted offers on the property out of a desire to avoid the City of Los Angeles\u2019\nMeasure ULA\nreal estate transfer tax, said Newmark\u2019s Kevin Shannon, who\nhelped broker the sale\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The price amounts to $483 per square foot.\nThe building, at 3350 West Bayshore Road, is 73 percent leased with tenants including liquid biopsy company Exai Bio and speciality chemical manufacturer Clariant Corporation.\nAlexandria has developed more than two dozen large office complexes in life science hubs like Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, New York City, Austin and North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle. That business makes up 77 percent of the firm\u2019s annual rental revenue.\nThe\nlife sciences real estate market\nfaces lower rental demand and\npaused developments\n, and Alexandria has been offloading or changing its strategy at some of those properties in response. It sold a fully leased life sciences building, a medical building and a 45-acre site in North Carolina, and it plans to\nconvert some of its San Francisco lab spaces to offices\n.\nEarlier this week, Alexandria closed a deal with the University of California, San Francisco to\nsell two adjacent buildings\nin San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay.\nDrug manufacturer FibroGen had its headquarters in one building before exiting\nits lease\nfour years early last year.

        "content": "The previous owners of a literary-themed\ndowntown\nChicago\nparking garage\nare on the hook for nearly $10 million after the lender seized the building through foreclosure this fall.\nThe lender, a subsidiary of global reinsurance firm Swiss Re, took over the Poetry Garage at 201 West Madison Street in an October sheriff\u2019s sale with a $21.5 million credit bid. This month, the lender secured a court order holding the ownership entities liable for the $9.6 million shortfall on the loan.\nThe borrowers, a group of investors controlled by Syndicated Equities\u2019 Richard Kaplan and John Hammerschlag of Hammerschlag &amp; Co., defaulted on the $33.2 million loan when it matured in March and they failed to pay the full balance, court records show. Kaplan and Hammerschlag were named as sponsor guarantors on the loan.\nNeither Syndicated Equities nor Hammerschlag immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe 10-story, 1,157-space garage in\nthe Loop\ngets its name from the dedication to poets, like Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, that mark each of its floors. The building has 385,310 square feet, including 19,312 square feet of retail.\nSwiss Re began foreclosure proceedings in April, according to Cook County Circuit Court records, seeking repayment of the full loan, as well as $275,000 in default interest.\nIn a December ruling, Judge Debra Ann Seaton found the borrowers owed $33.2 million to Swiss Re. A receiver had been appointed who had nearly $2 million in cash collateral, court records show.\nAfter reducing the total owed by the $21.5 million credit bid and $2 million cash from the receiver, the landlords owed an additional $9.6 million, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.\nCourt records paint a picture of years of financial struggle for the landlords before the $33.2 million loan came due this spring. As downtown\noffice occupancy\nplummeted because of the pandemic, the owners secured three separate loan modifications between June 2020 and March 2021. The agreements granted temporary interest-only periods and swept the borrower\u2019s cash flow to keep the deal intact.\nWhen the loan finally matured this spring, Swiss Re wasn\u2019t in a mood to negotiate. Court records show the lender rejected $800,000 in late payments the borrowers tried to make after the deadline. Swiss Re wrote in its filing that it rejected the payments because \u201cthey do not constitute full payment of the entire outstanding balance.\u201d\n",

He was 74.\nA spokesperson for family and friends confirmed Aaroe died in his Rancho Mirage home. They said he died peacefully after battling a rare neurological condition called Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\nAaroe was known to many as a celebrity agent and influencer before those terms were part of the everyday vernacular, with a star-studded client roster that included Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross, Cher and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. After standing out for sales at Jon Douglas Company, he carved a path for himself as a brokerage owner when he and Alan Field started John Aaroe &amp; Associates in 1994,\u00a0 gaining market share and claiming the highest agent sales per agent by 1999, according to RealTrends.\nAaroe, described by friends as charismatic, was tall in stature with feathery blond hair and a mustache that was known to draw looks when he walked into a room.\nWhile his career milestones as an agent were many, Aaroe is remembered by friends and former co-workers for his leadership and mentorship.\nColin Keenan, Westside Estate Agency executive vice president and general manager, worked for Aaroe for about 12 years and told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI, like many people, owe my career to the vision he created at John Aaroe &amp; Associates and the stunning array of talent he attracted.\u201d\n\u201cJohn did a lot to change the business for the better and helped set a higher standard in the luxury marketplace,\u201d Keenan said.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder Aaron Kirman was with John Aaroe Group, another brokerage Aaroe founded, between 2013 and 2016.\n\u201cJohn was an extraordinary mentor, a trusted friend and a remarkable human being,\u201d Kirman said in a statement to\nTRD\n. \u201cMuch of my success can be credited to his guidance, generosity and unwavering belief in others. His influence extended far beyond any one organization; across multiple companies and communities, John mentored and inspired countless individuals. The legacy he leaves behind lives on through the people he uplifted, the careers he shaped and the values he instilled wherever he went.\u201d\nCraig Strong of Compass also credited Aaroe for his career, calling him \u201ciconic,\u201d in an\nInstagram post\non Thursday evening.\nCompass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones joined John Aaroe Group in 2014 and was president of Aaroe International Luxury Properties in Beverly Hills.\n\u201c[Aaroe was] truly a guiding light in ethics and vision,\u201d \u00a0Forster Jones said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n.\nBuilding brokerages\nAaroe made a name for himself initially selling high-end real estate locally and forming the luxury estates division at Jon Douglas, called Douglas Properties. He led that division as general manager before teaming with Field to open their own brokerage.\nJohn Aaroe &amp; Associates made its debut to the market Jan. 17, the same day the Northridge earthquake struck the greater Los Angeles area with a 6.7 magnitude, devastating broad swaths of the city\u2019s residential stock and buckling the 10 Freeway. While some might have viewed that start as an ominous sign, Aaroe and Field went on to quickly scale the business in a big way so much so it was snapped up in 1998 by\nPickford Realty\n, which was part of Prudential Realty.\nAaroe stayed on with the firm as managing partner, running Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and the desert region at the company, which was renamed Prudential John Aaroe &amp; Associates.\nIn 2009, Aaroe opened John Aaroe Group and scaled that business until San Francisco\u2019s\nPacific Union International\ncame calling in 2017 with a purchase offer.\nThe\nmerger\ncreated a mega brokerage with a combined 1,100 agents across 38 California offices and volume of $10.5 billion.\nAaroe retained a stake in the business, which eventually became shares in Compass after the brokerage acquired Pacific Union in 2018.\nFull circle\nFollowing the sale to Pacific Union, Aaroe quietly retired to Rancho Mirage. In some ways, the move back to the Coachella Valley was a homecoming.\nAaroe, the only child of Danish immigrants, was born in Los Angeles and raised in Palm Springs.\nHis father, Oscar Aaroe, was a silversmith and owned his own boutique on Palm Canyon Drive, in the central nerve of the city\u2019s downtown.\nAaroe would later head back to Los Angeles, where he graduated from the University of Southern California and earned his real estate license in 1975.\nHe was self-made and gave back to the community from the start of John Aaroe &amp; Associates, when he established a charity that has since raised millions of dollars and continues on under Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices of America (which bought Prudential in 2012).\nThe charitable work was a point of reflection Aaroe shared with close friends earlier this month.\n\u201cI landed in L.A. without enough money to pay a month\u2019s rent. Ended up building three great companies, had the finest managers in town, the best people a person could hope for, like\nyou, who made me look better than I am, or deserved to look like,\u201d Aaroe said in a Dec. 7 text that was shared with\nTRD\n.\n\u201cLoved my Wheatens [terriers], had three boats, never sank one of them. The best of all wasn\u2019t the private planes (although they sure are addictive), it was our charitable foundation. Delivering gifts at night in South Central was a Christmas that no one can top. Young families, living in one room, and delivering armloads of gifts, food and a check for a month\u2019s rent\u2026. That felt like Christmas.\u201d\nA celebration of life for Aaroe is planned for February.\n",

        "content": "Nearly two decades after a risky real estate venture saddled Chicago\u2019s public pension funds with millions of dollars in losses, one of the developers at the center of that saga is back at City Hall \u2014 this time with plans for a hotel near the\nObama Presidential Center\n.\nAllison S. Davis, the former boss of Barack Obama who hired the future president fresh out of law school, is seeking to buy two city-owned lots for a proposed 28-story, 250-key hotel at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue,\naccording\nto the Chicago Sun-Times. The site sits a few blocks\nsouth\nof the future presidential center, a corridor many developers are betting will see a tourism bump when it opens next year.\nThe deal is moving forward even as\nDavis\n, who is now 85 and was a prolific developer during Richard M. Daley\u2019s mayoralty, owes the city millions. He is on the hook for a $6 million mortgage issued by the Daley administration in 2002 to finance\nAuburn Commons\nat 1626 West 87th Street, a senior housing complex on the South Side, the outlet reported.\nDavis also owes more than $270,000 in unpaid property taxes on the project, along with thousands of dollars in water bills and roughly $360,000 in other city fees and fines, city records show.\nThose obligations stem from a long and troubled real estate history. In the mid-2000s, Davis partnered with Robert G. Vanecko, Mayor Daley\u2019s nephew, to form DV Urban Realty Partners. The only investors they secured were five Chicago pension funds, which collectively invested $68 million. The deals ultimately collapsed, leaving the funds with more than $54 million in losses \u2014 including $11 million tied to a Mariano\u2019s-anchored project in Lakeview \u2014 even as Davis and Vanecko collected $9 million in fees. Investigations followed, but no criminal charges were filed.\nDespite that track record, the Johnson administration\u2019s Planning and Development Department agreed to sell Davis two adjacent vacant lots, estimated at about $144,000. The Chicago Plan Commission already signed off, and Alderman Desmon Yancy, whose ward includes the site, initially backed the project.\nThat support is now in question. Yancy told the outlet that he was unaware of the full scope of Davis\u2019 debts to the city and pension-related history when the proposal advanced. He has since said he cannot support the sale unless those obligations are resolved, citing fiduciary concerns as the city grapples with a $1.2 billion budget gap.\nBefore any land sale closes, Davis must line up financing and a hotel operator. Whether lenders will look past his unpaid debts remains unclear.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Howard Hughes Holdings is making its clearest break yet from its real estate focus, agreeing to buy specialty insurer Vantage Group Holdings in a $2.1 billion deal that anchors its shift to a diversified company.\nThe Woodlands-based firm said Thursday that it will acquire Bermuda-based Vantage, a specialty insurance and reinsurance firm backed by Carlyle and Hellman &amp; Friedman, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, and represents the first major operating business to sit alongside Howard Hughes\u2019 master-planned communities.\nFor Howard Hughes Executive Chairman\nBill Ackman\n, the deal puts real money behind a long telegraphed strategy. Ackman, whose Pershing Square entities bought a 47 percent stake in Howard Hughes in May, said he wants to turn the company into a \u201cmodern-day Berkshire Hathaway,\u201d using steady real estate cash flow to fuel investments beyond property. That\ndeal\nincluded Pershing Square agreeing to invest $900 million in Howard Hughes, as well as an investment in 9 million newly issued shares of Howard Hughes for $100 apiece.\nVantage gives\nHoward Hughes\na firm with immediate scale. Founded in 2020, the insurer wrote $1.2 billion in net premiums in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, split roughly into 60 percent specialty insurance and 40 percent reinsurance. The company employs about 370 people and reported book value of $1.3 billion as of late September.\nUnder the deal structure, Howard Hughes will acquire full legal ownership of Vantage now, with the ability to increase its ownership to 100 percent over time. Pershing Square will manage Vantage\u2019s investment assets on a fee-free basis, a key lever Ackman and his team believe can drive long-term value. The focus, the company said, will be underwriting discipline and profitability, rather than premium growth for its own sake.\nThe move builds on those changes set in motion earlier this year, when Pershing Square installed its chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, into a newly created CIO role at the company. CEO\nDavid O\u2019Reilly\nand the existing leadership team remain in place, now overseeing a broader mandate.\nHoward Hughes\u2019 real estate arm, Howard Hughes Communities, controls master-planned developments across Texas, Nevada, Hawaii, Maryland and Arizona. Pershing Square has argued those assets are nearing a phase where they generate excess cash beyond what\u2019s needed for development, freeing capital for outside investments like Vantage.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

University officials say housing is driving much of the visible construction activity, with multiple projects underway to increase on-campus capacity and keep students closer to school life.\nAustin-based\nAmerican Campus Communities\nis the anchor housing partner, developing roughly 2,500 beds across 11 buildings at four sites on campus. Construction is expected to wrap in summer 2027, a timeline that aligns with TCU\u2019s long-term bet on enrollment growth. Renovation work has also begun on the Market Square dining hall inside the Lupton University Union, a 15-year-old facility, with renovations slated for completion in fall 2026.\nMore is coming. The\nuniversity\nremains in active design for a renovation of Ed Landreth Hall, home to TCU\u2019s music and theater programs, with construction slated for a 2026 through 2028 timeline. Officials also told the outlet that they are studying chilled water and electrical capacity upgrades to support future development, along with feasibility studies for expanded recreation and athletics facilities.\nOne of the most prominent mixed-use projects tied to the expansion is Morado on Berry, rising along Berry Street at the campus\u2019 southern edge. Developed by Austin-based\nEndeavor Real Estate Group\nin partnership with TCU, the project will complete 780 luxury apartment-style beds for graduate students, a 950-space parking garage and 25,000 square feet of street-level retail. Plans include modern units, study lounges and a rooftop pool outfitted with a game day jumbotron. The\nproject\nis expected to go vertical in December.\nEndeavor says the development targets a gap in TCU\u2019s housing stock. While the area around campus is dense with smaller off-campus rentals, higher-end options for upperclassmen and graduate students have been limited. The retail mix is expected to skew heavily toward food-and-beverage tenants, adding another commercial node to Berry Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Glenn Straub allegedly backed out of a deal to sell a shuttered Palm Beach County golf course for nearly $21 million to BH Group.\nOn Dec. 10, an affiliate of Aventura-based BH, led by Liat and Isaac Toledano, sued an entity managed by Straub that owns the\nPolo West Golf Course\n, a 150.5-acre redevelopment site at 2470 Greenview Cove Drive in Wellington. The complaint, filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeks a court order to force the sale, which allegedly was supposed to close last month.\n\u201cAll the terms of the agreement were finalized, and then the seller refused to close,\u201d Robert Stok, an attorney for the BH affiliate, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cMy client is ready, willing and able to close, but [Straub\u2019s entity] just backed out of the deal.\u201d\nA\nStraub\nspokesperson provided a statement from the developer\u2019s legal team that said \u201cthe transaction stalled not due to a lack of cooperation by the seller, but because the buyer failed to perform under the terms it originally set, and later declined reasonable alternatives offered to facilitate closing.\u201d\nAccording to the complaint, Straub\u2019s entity agreed in August to sell the site for $20 million. BH Group paid a $250,000 deposit, later adding $100,000 when the inspection period was extended to Oct. 31, the lawsuit states.\nOn that date, the buyer and seller agreed to amend the contract to raise the purchase price to $20.7 million, with Straub\u2019s entity providing $20 million in seller financing at a 3 percent interest rate with a two-year maturity, the complaint alleges. Prior to a Nov. 10 closing date, the seller\u2019s attorney allegedly requested that the loan amount be reduced to $18.6 million, but did not provide an updated agreement.\nStraub\u2019s entity failed to consummate the sale, the lawsuit states.\nAccording to the Straub legal team statement,\u00a0 BH initially represented that it required no more than 30 days and a soil test to close on the property in full cash.\n\u201cThat representation formed the basis for allowing the contract to proceed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, once those conditions were satisfied, BH Group did not close as stated. Instead, the buyer repeatedly requested extensions, despite having previously asserted readiness to perform.\u201d\nStraub offered seller financing to prevent the deal from collapsing, but that BH wouldn\u2019t agree to terms that protected the seller for assuming lender risk,\u00a0 the statement said.\nStraub, who owns Palm Beach Polo &amp; Country Club, reacquired the Polo West property from veterinarian Scott Swerdlin about a year ago. Swerdlin had purchased it from Straub for $16 million in 2019, but Straub resumed control earlier this year, per state records.\nPolo West Golf Course once hosted PGA Tour events and had polo fields and croquet lawns, but Straub\u2019s failed efforts to redevelop it left the property overgrown and idle. He\u2019s faced decades of code citations from Wellington officials over property maintenance and permit issues.\nBH\nhas no immediate redevelopment plans, a person familiar with the deal said. The firm is one of the most prolific development-site buyers in South Florida, and has partnered with firms like\nRelated Group\n,\nPebb Enterprises\nand\nKolter\non several mixed-use, hotel, and condo projects.",

        "content": "A landmarked Palm Beach mansion, fresh off an extensive renovation, is angling for one of the priciest residential sales in the country.\nCasa del Ensuenos, a 1923 Venetian-style estate at 800 South County Road, hit the market asking $175 million, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n. The 1.5-acre Intracoastal Waterway property has 200 feet of waterfront and sits just north of President Donald Trump\u2019s\nMar-a-Lago Club\n, in one of Palm Beach\u2019s most exclusive corridors.\nDesigned by\nAddison Mizner\n, the society architect who shaped Palm Beach\u2019s Mediterranean Revival identity, the estate is one of just two Venetian-style mansions he built in town. Palm Beach designated the property a landmark in 1980.\nViewed from the lake, portions of the house appear to rise directly from the seawall \u2014 a design feature that became a liability as tides crept higher.\nBusinesswoman Ann DesRuisseaux bought the estate for a recorded $24 million in 2020 and launched an intense restoration and elevation project after repeated flooding from the Lake Worth Lagoon.\nSaltwater inundated the first floor during king tides and major storms, and the property depended on a pumping system with a maze of drains.\nHow much DesRuisseaux spent on the renovation remains unclear, but it\u2019s been described as in the millions.\nIt required multiple Town Council hearings before approval was granted to raise and restore the structure. The project has since become a high-profile example of how Palm Beach\u2019s ultra-luxury estates are adapting to\nrising sea levels\n.\nThe estate spans 27,000 square feet of living space, including 21,500 square feet of air-conditioned interiors, with 15 bedrooms, 18 bathrooms and five half-bathrooms, according to the listing.\nArchitectural features include a half-round stair tower, lakefront balconies, cast-stone detailing and a courtyard archway that once served as a yacht entrance.\nPremier Estate Properties\u2019 Margit Brandt has the listing. The broker described the home to the outlet as \u201cone-of-one\u201d and \u201cone of the most iconic renovations in Palm Beach history.\u201d\nPalm Beach\u2019s most expensive listing is a\nNorth End oceanfront estate\n, which hit the market last month asking $205 million.\nFlorida \u2014 and the United States \u2014 saw a new record home sale last year, when the billionaire DeGroote family\nsold their waterfront Naples estate\nfor $225 million in April.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

The buyer paid roughly $128 per square foot.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokered the transaction.\nPompano Citi Centre is the latest South Florida shopping center to change hands in a recent flurry of year-end trades.\nThe seller, an affiliate of West Palm Beach-based Sterling Organization, paid\n$15 million\nfor the 35-acre property in 2012, records show. The firm subsequently redeveloped a former Sears Auto Center into a fully leased multi-tenant strip mall.\nLast year, Macy\u2019s sold a separate 12 acres, including one of the retailer\u2019s shuttered stores, on the mall site for\n$18.8 million\nto Morgan Group and Carlyle Group.

The debt was increased to $405 million in November 2024. The note was due for repayment in July and climbed to about $439.5 million, including accrued interest and late charges, as of last month. A reason for the default was not disclosed.\nSteve Witkoff\nsold a $120 million stake\nin his firm to avoid potential conflicts of interest after being appointed Pres.

BroadwaySF will continue to operate the Curran and its lineup of shows, including Broadway tours and celebrity appearances will not change.\nIn acquiring the Curran, the\nGiants\nare doubling down on their \u201ccore belief that sports, arts and culture are essential to San Francisco\u2019s identity, economy and resurgence,\u201d Larry Baer, Giants president and CEO, said of the sale. With the property, Baer said the Giants will be able to expand the team\u2019s event production capabilities, as the limited MLB season has led Baer to turn down potential clients and promoters.\nShorenstein Hays, a Tony Award-winning theater producer, first began her Best of Broadway programming at the Curran in 1977. She became the owner of the venue in 2010 and oversaw a major renovation of the venue completed in 2017. \u201cIt was essential to me that [the Curran\u2019s] next stewards would ensure it remains a vibrant home for artists and audiences alike,\u201d she said, thanking the Giants for \u201cstepp[ing] up to the plate.\u201d\nBaer said that Shorenstein Hays\u2019 banker first floated a possible sale of the venue to the team two months ago. The Giants president had a longstanding relationship with Walter Shorenstein. \u201cOur original conversations about buying the Giants were in his offices in 555 California Street,\u201d he said of the investor search process to buy the team.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time an MLB team has made a play for arts-related real estate. The\nAtlanta Braves own\nthe Coca-Cola Roxy concert venue in Atlanta, and the Boston Red Sox own the MGM Music Hall at Fenway.\nOver the years, the Curran has hosted several landmark theater productions, including the premiere of \u201cWicked\u201d before it moved to Broadway and an engagement of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d which earned Shorenstein Hays two Tony Awards for its original 1987 Broadway run featuring James Earl Jones and its 2010 revival starring Denzel Washington.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Economists don\u2019t need any more evidence that rent control is bad and new housing is good. But they\u2019ll take it.\nThe latest example comes from Minnesota, where the Twin Cities gifted us with a natural experiment: A referendum in St. Paul imposed a draconian version of rent control \u2014 a 3 percent maximum increase, even on vacant units and new construction \u2014 while Minneapolis made it easier to build housing.\nThe Wall Street Journal just ran a\nstory\non the results. From 2022 to 2024, rents in capitalist Minneapolis went up only 0.7 percent, versus 1.8 percent in rent-controlled St. Paul and 3.3 percent nationally.\nAlso, multifamily development plunged in St. Paul because investors and lenders shunned projects that could not make money. Across the river in Minneapolis, housing permits nearly quadrupled in early 2022.\n\u201cDowntown hubs blossomed as new apartments hit the market and attracted young professionals,\u201d the Journal wrote.\nThe article illustrated the data with real-world examples of people moving to downtown Minneapolis while market-rate projects in St. Paul were canceled.\nThe Journal story wasn\u2019t perfect, however. It claimed, \u201cThe development boom did less for lower- and middle-income residents, who can\u2019t afford the new housing that is aimed primarily at the higher-end.\u201d\nBut lower earners\ncan\nafford the housing that higher earners vacate upon moving into the new buildings. The Minneapolis Fed documented this effect, called\nfiltering\n. The working class certainly benefited from rents in the city rising only 0.7 percent despite going up almost five times as much nationwide.\nThe Journal cited a curious statistic to back up its assertion that the new supply has \u201cdone less\u201d for lower-income renters: \u201cEviction filings in Minneapolis were up around 68 percent from December 2024 to November this year compared with the prepandemic average, according to data from Eviction Lab. They were 61 percent higher in St. Paul.\u201d\nWhat?\nThe eviction rate rose by about the same percentage in rent-controlled St. Paul as in free-market Minneapolis. If anything, that suggests rent control did not curb evictions and new development did not increase them.\nMoreover, eviction rates are affected by numerous factors. The Journal made no attempt to show a cause-and-effect relationship involving rent control, new housing supply and evictions.\nWe do know that rent collection fell during the pandemic and never fully recovered. Maybe the eviction moratoriums and the \u201ccancel rent\u201d campaigns played a role. In any event, nearly all evictions are for nonpayment of rent. Evictions likely rose in Minneapolis and St. Paul because more tenants didn\u2019t pay, not because of rent control or lack thereof.\nIt\u2019s possible that the reporter or her editor was trying to give the other side of the story. But if there is no other side, you can\u2019t just invent one.\nOn the whole, the article provides a reality check on the foolish notion that the way to keep rents down is to make it illegal to raise them. Minnesotans soon realized this: Last spring, two years into its failed experiment with rent control, St. Paul exempted properties built after 2004.\nThen, St. Paul and Minneapolis elected new mayors who oppose rent control. The socialist candidate in Minneapolis lost.\nI emailed the Journal story to an urban planner I know in Minnesota.\n\u201cI hope it creates momentum for the city to continue to undo the voters\u2019 misguided referendum. I know quite a few people who voted for it when it happened,\u201d she replied. \u201cThere was so little information, and to a liberal-minded person it sounded like a good thing. None of those people would vote for it today with a better understanding now that it\u2019s not a tool that works.\u201d\n",

        "content": "New York City is putting co-op boards on the clock.\nThe City Council on Thursday\napproved a bill\naimed at cutting down on co-op board application response times. Members voted 46 to 2 in a veto-proof majority, which means the bill will become law.\nThe bill, proposed by Majority Leader and known as 1120, Amanda Farias, would require co-op boards to let applicants know within 15 days that they\u2019ve received their application and whether their application is considered complete or if they need more information to proceed. Once the application is whole, the board has 45 days to accept or reject a prospective sale.\nThe legislation was part of a controversial package designed to make the co-op board application process more transparent and to reduce discrimination. The bill was the only one of the three to make it out of the housing committee and go before the full Council for a vote.\nAt a committee meeting earlier this month, co-op board leaders\nrallied against\nthe package, which included a provision that would require boards to disclose their reasons for denying an application.\nThough the so-called Reasons Bill drew the most criticism, board members also told lawmakers that imposing timelines on application responses could be burdensome to small boards, who may already be struggling to comply with their usual duties.\nHowever, their chief concern was a portion of the bill stating that if a board failed to meet the timeline, the pending application would be automatically accepted. That piece, however, was removed from the version of the bill approved by Council members, replaced instead by fines beginning at $1,000 for the first violation.\nEven if boards aren\u2019t too fond of regulation, some brokers are welcoming the changes to the application process, historically known for causing much hand-wringing for buyers, sellers and the people who represent them. They\u2019re hopeful that the bill could keep boards from holding their deals \u2014 and their commissions \u2014 hostage.\n\u201cTime kills all deals,\u201d said The Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri. \u201cI\u2019ve had co-op approvals take 8, 10, even 12 weeks with no clear reason other than \u2018the board hasn\u2019t met yet.\u2019 That kind of uncertainty is brutal for buyers and sellers, and it makes co-ops feel riskier than they need to be compared to condos.\u201d\nFabbri added that he doesn\u2019t think the proposed law would \u201ctake power away from boards,\u201d but instead \u201cjust puts a clock on a process that\u2019s historically been completely open-ended.\u201d\nDelays in the application process can make it difficult for buyers, especially, who could be facing a lease renewal or whose mortgage deals may lapse in the time it takes for an application to be reviewed, said Douglas Wagner, Bond New York\u2019s director of brokerage services. If timelines are imposed, buyers and sellers will at least have a better idea of how long they\u2019ll need to wait.\n\u201cBeing able to plan those things in advance saves money and stress,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThis is fairness and accountability.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nDonna Olshan\nonce called\nDecember one of the best times of the year to shop for a luxury home \u2014 and buyers in Manhattan appear to agree.\nAs the year winds down, the borough\u2019s luxury market has stayed busy, with buyers signing contracts for more than 60 homes asking $4 million or more in just the first two weeks of the month, according to data from Olshan Realty.\nThe priciest deal inked so far this year is shaping up to be a blockbuster. Sources told\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this week that a buyer agreed to pay\n$129 million\nfor multiple units at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s 80 Clarkson Street.\nThe pending deal, if it closes for that price, would become the most expensive sale in history in Downtown Manhattan, though we won\u2019t have the final verdict until next year at the earliest.\nNews of the signed contract came after two units at Zeckendorf\u2019s 15 Central Park West, asking $27 million and $25 million respectively, also found buyers and\ntopped the week\u2019s\ncontract reports. The pending deals were accompanied by two recent closings at the Upper West Side tower, including for Unit 29A, which sold for $22 million, and for Unit 5B, which sold for $19 million.\nThe spark of activity at the building, dubbed \u201cLimestone Jesus,\u201d followed the\ndeath of its famed architect\n, Robert A.M. Stern. The former Dean of Yale\u2019s architecture school died in late November at the age of 86.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street, which sold for just under\n$47 million\n, or roughly $6,700 per square foot. The apartment, which was never publicly listed, sold to a buyer whose identity was shielded by an LLC.\nUnit 41E spans 7,000 square feet and has six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features nearly 300 square feet of outdoor space.\n",

        "content": "Could a brutal work schedule be the deus ex machina commercial real estate\u2019s been waiting for?\nNew York has long prided itself on being the city that never sleeps. But even by Big Apple standards, the latest mantra circulating among some AI companies sounds extreme: 9-9-6.\nDon\u2019t get it confused with 6-7: this new number means 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, a work schedule with roots in China\u2019s tech sector that\u2019s been creeping into Silicon Valley, and now, Manhattan. The grind could be a boon for commercial real estate, driving demand for offices built for long hours and residential developments close to where people work.\n\u201cWhat interests me about the AI companies that we\u2019re dealing with is that they\u2019re very different in culture than what we think of as the typical tech companies,\u201d Mary Ann Tighe said at this month\u2019s NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate capital markets conference. In other words, they aren\u2019t the typical tech firms with kombucha taps and casual Fridays. One AI executive allegedly told her bluntly that their culture is 9-9-6.\n\u201cNow you describe why we\u2019re seeing such incredible growth here,\u201d Tighe said of the AI sector. \u201cHow many workforces are there in our country where you can get a significant body of employees who sign on for 9-9-6?\u201d\nLong hours and the weekend grind aren\u2019t new to sectors like finance and law. But a 72-hour workweek takes that hard-charging culture to a new extreme. The 9-9-6 buzz started bubbling up recently in Silicon Valley amid the AI arms race, with job listings hinting at 70-hour weeks and weekend spending spikes at office-adjacent businesses suggesting that people aren\u2019t signing off, according to the New York Times.\nThat same relentless work ethic appears to be migrating east, where New York City-based AI startup Rilla\u2019s website discourages candidates who aren\u2019t \u201cexcited about\u201d in-person, 70-hour workweeks from applying, as Fast Company recently reported.\nNew York office-to-residential developers are now targeting the 9-9-6 crowd. Rudin, for example, is converting 845 Third Avenue into 411 apartments and 355 Lexington Avenue into 297 units, betting that these well-paid professionals will opt for convenience and proximity over traditionally residential neighborhoods.\n\u201cThe 9-9-6 is who our market is for,\u201d Bill Rudin said at the conference.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working at Citadel, Blackstone, Blue Owl or JPMorgan along Park, Madison or Sixth, chances are you\u2019re already logging those hours, or worse,\u201d Rudin said. \u201cThe question then becomes logistical: Do you want a 20-minute subway ride home just to turn around and do it again, or do you want to walk three blocks to a new apartment with a gym, workspaces and amenities built for people who might still be working on Sunday?\u201d\nThe city that never sleeps may be living up to its name.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: At its most recent earnings call, CBRE Chairman and CEO Bob Sulentic said data centers produced nearly $700 million of revenue in the third quarter, up 40 percent year over year. Other brokerages have reported similar results. A new crop of young brokers is cashing in on data center land deals and racking up hefty commissions. Who are the top players? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nHeisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza interned at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark in the San Francisco Bay Area after graduating from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business last spring. Mendoza transferred this year as a redshirt junior to Indiana University, where he threw 33 touchdowns and had six rushing touchdowns for the season.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2013 Fitness trainer Jerry Genesis allegedly bilked at least eight would-be renters in Manhattan and Brooklyn out of more than $100,000 by pretending to have apartments available for sublet, then charging bogus move-in fees to unsuspecting victims, the\nNew York Post\nreported. None of the renters were able to move into the apartments they thought they had subleased, per the Post.\n\u2013 Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that 2025 has been one of the safest years on the subway so far this century,\nThe New York Times\nreported. Except for two years during the peak of the pandemic, major crime on the subway is at its lowest level since 2009, and the system is on pace to have its second-lowest crime rate since the 1990s, according to the governor\u2019s office. Major crimes include rape, murder, robbery and felony assault.\n\u2013 Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik\nannounced\nshe is no longer running for governor of New York. Stefanik, a staunch Trump supporter, announced her campaign to unseat Kathy Hochul last month. She is also vacating her seat in Congress.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$21.3 million\nfor a 4,183-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 111 West 57th Street in the Plaza District. Nikki Field, Ben Pofcher, and Jeanne H Bucknam with Sotheby\u2019s\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$6.65 million\nfor a 15-unit apartment building at 977 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20.5 million\nfor an 8,000-square-foot townhouse at 123 East 71st Street in Lenox Hill. The Benalloul Team with Corcoran has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 86,241-square-foot, 11-story mixed-use project with 72 units at 11-35 31st Drive in Astoria. Angelo Ng + Anthony Ng Architects filed the permit on behalf of Li Qing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The City Council\nclosed out its final meeting\nby approving a sweeping housing package that reshapes the economics of city-backed development and hands the next administration a deeply altered policy landscape.\nLawmakers signed off on COPA, new affordability and unit-mix mandates and a construction wage floor, despite warnings from the Adams administration and housing groups that the measures could reduce production and spook investment.\nThe most immediate impact is financial. HPD estimates a trio of bills would require roughly $600 million more per year to maintain current housing output, or force the city to finance 3,275 fewer units annually if that funding doesn\u2019t materialize.\nSpeaker Adrienne Adams did not contest those figures. Instead, Council leaders framed the bills as a necessary recalibration of how public money is used.\nCOPA is the flashpoint. The bill gives nonprofits and city-approved entities a right of first offer and refusal on certain distressed or expiring-affordability multifamily properties, a change landlords and brokers say will slow deals and deter buyers.\nThe measure passed without a veto-proof majority, signaling potential trouble ahead if Mayor Eric Adams opts to reject it on his way out the door. Notably, presumptive next speaker Julie Menin abstained, leaving the bill\u2019s durability in question.\nBeyond COPA, the legislation package layers new requirements onto city financing: minimum thresholds for extremely low- and very low-income units, mandated shares of two- and three-bedroom apartments, a homeownership set-aside and a $40-an-hour wage and benefits floor for large, city-funded projects.\nTogether, they significantly raise development costs and narrow the pool of feasible deals.\nThese bills land just as Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani prepares to take office with a goal of producing 200,000 affordable units over the next decade and as the city touts pro-growth zoning reforms.\nBy locking in stricter conditions on public financing, the outgoing Council has effectively forced the next mayor to choose between scaling back ambitions, finding fresh funding or fighting to unwind the legislation.\nWe\u2019re in the thick of the holiday season, but New York\u2019s real estate industry has shown no signs of taking time off. Here\u2019s some of the week\u2019s other big stories.\nZeckendorf, Atlas Capital\u2019s 80 Clarkson nabs contract for $129M\nA buyer signed a contract to purchase multiple units at 80 Clarkson, the 112-unit, buzzy, ultra-luxury project being developed by Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group. Should a sale close at the $129 million ask, it would easily surpass the record for the most expensive deal in Downtown Manhattan.\nJackpot! 3 NYC casinos get official go-ahead, with caveat\nAs expected this week, the New York Gaming Commission approved casino licenses for the three remaining proposals in New York City: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park near Citi Field, the complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe caveat? The companies needed to agree to have an independent monitor to ensure they adhere to the promises they made to their respective communities.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lex headed to auction block\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue is scheduled for auction on Jan. 21 to pay off a $155.9 million loan. It\u2019s the latest in a series of well-documented asset sales and losses for Cohen.\nBushburg buys FiDi office at steep discount for possible resi conversion\nJoseph Hoffman\u2019s Bushburg Properties bought the 1970s-era office building at 100 William Street for $70 million.

        "content": "The mayor thinks the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is \u201cshortsighted.\u201d\nThat was the term a City Hall spokesperson used to describe the bill, along with various housing bills\napproved\nby the City Council on Thursday.\n\u201cFortunately, Mayor Adams is in office until December 31 and we will be reviewing our next steps regarding the bills passed today,\u201d the spokesperson, Fabien Levy, said in a statement.\nFor landlords and brokers, this offers a glimmer of hope that the mayor could veto COPA, a measure they say is an unfair intrusion into private deals that could deter investment, delay closings and make it harder to line up financing.\nThe measure gives city-approved nonprofits, as well as nonprofits that form a joint venture with not-for-profit companies, the first opportunity to bid on certain multifamily buildings with four or more units.\nIn the lead-up to the bill\u2019s passage, landlord groups railed against the measure, with some rallying outside of City Hall on Thursday and showing up to Council committee meetings to express their distress over the law. After the Committee on Housing and Buildings voted in favor of the measure on Thursday, some yelled out \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cThieves, they are thieves!\u201d\n\u201cCOPA will make New York City an affordable housing wasteland and trigger the extinction of small owners,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said in a statement after the measure passed the full Council. \u201cCOPA is a dangerous blueprint that puts a target on every other free enterprise and privately owned small business.\u201d\nIf the mayor vetoes the measure, it would be up to the next City Council, should it elect to do so, to override.\nThe chances of that happening, at this point, appear slim.\nThe bill secured 30 yes votes, while 10 members rejected it and eight abstained. At least 34 Council members must vote to override a veto.\nThree of those \u201cyes\u201d votes came from Council members Justin Brannan, Diana Ayala and Adrienne Adams, all of whom are leaving office. Three abstentions were from outgoing Council members Francisco Moya, Rafael Salamanca and Keith Powers, and two nos were from the departing Council members Bob Holden and Kristy Marmorato.\nGiven those exits, members would need to flip a combination of seven \u201cno\u201d votes or abstentions to get to the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.\nEven then, the decision to try to override would likely be up to Council member Julie Menin, the presumed next City Council speaker. Notably, Menin abstained from voting on COPA. A spokesperson did not immediately comment on Menin\u2019s decision.\nCOPA\u2019s sponsor, Council member Sandy Nurse, declined to comment on Friday.\nMeanwhile, Menin voted in favor of bills that would create new restrictions on the kinds of housing that the city finances and would set minimum construction wages and benefits for certain projects. The administration has estimated that these bills would add $600 million to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s annual budget needs.\nThe mayor is also reviewing these measures, which passed with a supermajority of support.\nCOPA, first introduced in 2020, was the subject of multiple City Council hearings, but only gained traction in the past month or so.\nThe measure underwent several changes that reduced the pool of eligible buildings, focusing on distressed properties and those with soon-to-expire affordability requirements, and shrunk the period of time that nonprofits and eligible joint ventures can exclusively vie for properties.\nWhen owners of certain multifamily buildings with four or more units want to sell their buildings, they must first notify the city and its approved prospective buyers. Those city-approved entities would then have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property. Once that time runs out, the interested qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. Qualified entities also have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nThe administration wanted COPA to apply solely to buildings involved in an enforcement program. Under the measure, buildings enrolled in the city\u2019s alternative enforcement program for at least one year are subject to COPA. The bill includes other criteria for distress, however, and also applies to buildings that have affordability requirements expiring in the next two years.\nProponents of the measure believe it will help steer troubled multifamily buildings to new owners focused on affordability. Deyanira Del Rio, executive director of New Economy Project, said COPA will help community land trusts \u201ctake land and housing off the speculative market and bring them into permanently affordable community control.\u201d\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s vote, Nurse noted that the city is already \u201cputting a ton of money\u201d into helping these distressed buildings and that COPA creates a \u201ctiny chance\u201d that these properties will be bought by nonprofits the city trusts. She also expressed frustration about misinformation around COPA, including that it applies to homeowners. Owners who live in their buildings are exempt if the property has five or fewer units.\n\u201cI ask all of my colleagues to do their reading before they come to vote on bills,\u201d she said. \u201cMake sure you know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nRepublican Council member Inna Vernikov called the measure a \u201cstunning example of government overreach\u201d and referred to it as part of a \u201ccommunist agenda\u201d pushed under \u201cthe guise of helping the poor and the underprivileged.\u201d\nIf COPA ultimately becomes law, Eliad Shapiro, a partner at Herrick, thinks the measure could face a legal challenge.\n\u201cThe right to negotiate, to dispose of your property however you want, sell it to whoever you want, is viewed by the courts as a fundamental property right,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "The doors have closed \u2014 literally \u2014 on Albert Behler\u2019s reign at Paramount Group.\nThe longtime CEO and chairman of Paramount was escorted out Friday morning when he showed up to his old office at 1633 Broadway despite no longer being employed at the company, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nBehler was visibly upset as he was forced to leave the building, sources said.\nThe bizarre saga played out on Rithm Capital\u2019s first day as owner of Paramount Group, a major office landlord in New York and San Francisco.\nRithm\nannounced plans\nto acquire the REIT for $1.6 billion in September. In a press release posted Friday morning, the company said that Behler would no longer be kept on under the new ownership. Behler, 73, was seen packing a few of his belongings in recent days, sources said.\nBut Behler seemed unable to change his routine.\nAlthough his official last day was Thursday, Behler showed up to the office the following day, in a scene reminiscent of a famous \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode of when George Costanza quit his job, only to return to work the next day as though nothing happened.\nIt\u2019s unclear what time Behler showed up at the building, but around 10:30 a.m, Behler was told to leave and escorted out of 1633 Broadway. He was met by two security guards in the building\u2019s lobby and walked to his car, sources said. Afterwards, security staff were informed that Behler would no longer have access to Paramount\u2019s buildings, per sources.\nA spokesperson for Paramount Group did not return a request for comment. Rithm Capital declined to comment.\nIn a press release announcing the closing of its deal today, Rithm disclosed that Behler \u201cis departing the company,\u201d but did not offer any additional details.\nThe strange ordeal caps a tumultuous year for Behler, who had led the company for over three decades. First, Paramount revealed it made millions of dollars in payments to Behler\u2019s outside companies or personal interests. The expenses included: $3 million to a private jet firm in which Behler had a 50 percent stake and $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services. The payments were previously undisclosed.\nThen, this summer, Paramount revealed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation having to do with its disclosures about related-party transactions, conflicts of interests and other issues.\nShortly after that,\nThe Real Deal\ndiscovered Behler had personally directed a no-bid contract with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s security services firm.\nBehler\u2019s days at Paramount appeared to be numbered when Paramount reached an agreement to sell the firm to Rithm for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 per share, earlier this year, after an intense multi-round bidding process.\nDubai-based Saray Capital, which owned a 5.4 percent stake in Paramount, tried to make a last-minute offer for $6.95 per share. But shareholders ultimately approved Rithm\u2019s bid this week.\nShareholders, however, rejected a proposal to pay Behler\u2019s golden parachute of $34 million, Crain\u2019s reported. The shareholder vote is non-binding, meaning Behler could still end up with an impressive compensation package.\nAhead of his departure, Behler sent a note out to his employees, acknowledging his appreciation for their hard work.\n\u201cThank you for your trust, support, and all the laughter along the way,\u201d he wrote.\n",

Debt special servicer LNR Partners is collaborating on the sale process, which would help Savanna duck a foreclosure that\u2019s at least a year in the making.\nLNR declined to comment to the outlet, while Savanna did not respond to a request for comment.\nSavanna\u2019s\nbeen in trouble\nat 521 Fifth Avenue since last November, when Wells Fargo \u2014 acting as a trustee on behalf of CMBS bondholders \u2014 filed a preforeclosure suit against the landlord. The bank angled for a sale of the 39-story property to recoup losses.\nSavanna was allegedly past due on a $242 million loan backed by the property, which features an Urban Outfitters store and an Equinox gym, in addition to office space. The loan matured in June 2021, according to the suit, but Savanna received three extensions that took the loan through last June.\nThe loan helped finance Savanna\u2019s $381 million purchase of the property from SL Green in 2019.\nA default judgment in favor of the lender was issued in August. At that point, the debt had ballooned to $259 million with interest accumulating. An auction would be the next step, but no date has been set.\nThe property was 93 percent occupied when Savanna obtained the lease, but that dropped to 68 percent as of June, according to Morningstar Credit. Urban Outfitters \u2014 the largest tenant with 26,000 square feet \u2014 is on a lease set to expire in a couple of months.\nSavanna recently pulled a rabbit out of its distress hat,\nsecuring $510 million\nto refinance the 683,000-square-foot office building at 5 Bryant Park. King Street Capital Management and Blue Owl Capital originated the floating-rate loan on the property.\nDespite dealing with its own set of office distress, Savanna bought the leasehold on 430 West 15th Street in the Meatpacking District for\n$85 million\nin February, a discount to the $159 million that Invesco paid for the property in 2018.\nLast November, Savanna bought the newly constructed office building at 799 Broadway for\n$255 million\nafter owner Columbia Property Trust had defaulted on its $270 million mortgage.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Moshe Silber,\na key player in a major mortgage fraud scheme\n, has been released from prison and is moving into a halfway house in New York.\nSilber was sentenced in March to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. As of this summer, Silber was incarcerated in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.\nSilber is still listed under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons and is at a Residential Reentry Center, otherwise known as a halfway house, according to the agency\u2019s website. The exact location of his halfway house is unclear.His release date is January 2027.\nHiten Samtani of the Promote first\nposted on X\nabout the news on Thursday, citing a post in English and Yiddish from the Orthodox Jewish news service, CBN. It mentioned that Silber is heading to a halfway house through the First Steps Act, which was passed under President Donald Trump in 2018 and offers non-violent offenders a reduction in sentencing for participation in certain programs.\nSilber will be returning to Monsey, New York, to celebrate Hanukkah with his family, according Yiddish text in the post, which refers to Silber as \u201ctzadikah,\u201d or \u201ccharitable\u201d in Hebrew.\n\u201cWelcome Home Moshe Silber,\u201d it said in English.\nAttorneys for Silber did not immediately return a request to comment.\nSilber was among the first to be charged in a\nprobe into commercial mortgage fraud\nby the Department of Justice, Federal Housing Finance Agency and other government departments. The investigation has focused on a variety of schemes that allowed borrowers to obtain larger loans from lenders than they otherwise would have received.\nSilber and his co-conspirators duped their lenders, JLL and Fannie Mae, into providing a $74 million loan for a 976-unit apartment complex in Cincinnati.\nAs part of the scheme, Silber and his conspirators acquired the property, the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million in 2019. But, Silber and his partners used a stolen identity and bogus documents to show Fannie Mae and JLL the property had been purchased for $95 million. The inflated fraudulent price caused Fannie and JLL to provide a $74 million loan.\nAs a result, Silber was able to secure a loan for more than he paid for the property.\nSilber, who led Rhodium Capital and once controlled at least 11,000 multifamily units, pleaded guilty in 2024 along with his co-conspirator, Fred Schulman, who was sentenced to just one year in prison. Another one of his co-conspirators, Boruch Drillman, received no prison time.\nSilber\nis also dealing with separate criminal charges in Pennsylvania. The Allegheny County District Attorney\u2019s office claims Silber allegedly diverted funds from an apartment project Silber\u2019s group owned outside of Pittsburgh.\nSilber\u2019s former real estate companies are under the control of an independent fiduciary, who is seeking to sell the apartments through bankruptcy. During that process, Silber filed for personal\nbankruptcy\nin September, claiming he owned no property, assets, or income.\n",

The loan was anticipated to trade at a discount, and Morningstar Credit earlier this month offered servicer commentary that a deal was shaping up with \u201ca buyer likely identified.\u201d\nReceiver Gregg Williams said no buyer was under contract as of Friday, but did not answer when asked if one had been identified. The brokerage declined to comment and the special servicer did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe identity of any potential buyer and pricing is a mystery \u2014 and it is fair to wonder whether any deal would stick.\nTwo years ago, the downtown skyscraper was handed to a receiver after Brookfield defaulted on the debt. Since then a $130 million deal to purchase it\ncollapsed\n, and its value has\nplummeted\nfurther.\nThe 41-story, 900,000-square-foot property at 725 South Figueroa Street in Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Financial District was worth $446 million in August 2020, according to Morningstar. It\u2019s worth $135 million, now. That puts its value at about $150 a square foot.\nIt\u2019s one of four office\nofferings\nin the Financial District tied to Brookfield and on the market via some form of distress \u2014 a quartet that adds up to almost a fifth of the Class A office space in the submarket.\nShopping the mall\nIn other Brookfield news, the commercial giant is\nselling\nFIGat7th.\nJLL has the offering, and the 330,000-square-foot mall at 735 South Figueroa Street is 85.8 percent occupied, per the broker. The shopping mall \u201ccould fetch $70 million,\u201d according to Green Street, which would come out to about $210 per square foot \u2014 a bargain compared to recent retail deals, but not the typical distress that is synonymous with downtown properties owned by the landlord. Still, Brookfield is nearing an end of a three-year extension on a $58.5 million loan on the real estate.\nUnder fire\nLandlord Jamison reportedly turned away Section 8 voucher holders at its properties,\naccording to\nnonprofit publication Capital &amp; Main. If true, that would be a violation of state law, which prohibits such discrimination.\nJamison, helmed by Jamie Lee, denied the allegations and in a statement claimed its management companies \u201caccept and welcome tenants utilizing Section 8 vouchers.\u201d The company called the reporting \u201ccompletely wrong and/or misleading,\u201d according to Capital &amp; Main but did not cite any specific errors in the reporting.\nCapital &amp; Main said it hired testers to pose as Section 8 voucher holders and contact leasing agents at buildings owned or operated by seven landlords between late 2024 and early 2025. Of the 21 Jamison properties, agents at 15 said they did not accept Section 8 vouchers at all. At others, agents noted income or credit requirements that would exclude voucher holders, or failed to follow up after suggesting vouchers may be accepted. Between 2021 and 2024, only one Section 8 tenant moved into a Jamison property, according to Capital &amp; Main.\nHollywood can\u2019t take another takeover\nSoundstage owners can\u2019t catch a break. Things were bad before all the talk of a Netflix-Warner Bros. takeover, but things could get worse. Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, the largest independent owner and operator of soundstages,\ntold\nthe Wall Street Journal, \u201cthe whole ecosystem is really under distress.\u201d\nFilming in Los Angeles remains in a slowdown touched off by the 2023 dual writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes and the rise of cheaper production centers abroad. The result lately has been sky-high vacancies and depressed rents for studios. The consolidation likely to accompany a Warner Bros.-Netflix match would mean even less demand for studio space.\nHackman, who happens to be in the midst of a legal tussle with billionaire Rick Caruso over the $1-billion expansion and renovation of the former CBS Television City studio, isn\u2019t the only one feeling the pain.\nLosses are ballooning at Victor Coleman\u2019s Hudson Pacific Properties, which owns studios and offices. The company\nreported\na loss of $136.5 million in the third quarter and mostly blamed the slump on the deconsolidation of Sunset Glenoaks, a $200 million purpose-built studio developed by Hudson Pacific in partnership with Blackstone. It\u2019s only 8 percent leased after being delivered last year.\n",

        "content": "Even though a\nturf war\nis playing out in Chicago that could soon upend how local homebuyers and sellers engage with the market, you shouldn\u2019t expect the people most affected by it to get a say.\nZillow has threatened to pull listings\nfrom the Chicago area\u2019s multiple listing service, which is operated by Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED), unless the MLS scraps its Private Listing Network \u2014 a feature Zillow says promotes exclusivity and restricts fair housing access.\nIn Chicago, if Zillow and MRED can\u2019t resolve their spat before January, listings from the Midwest\u2019s biggest market could disappear from the country\u2019s most-visited home search site.\nMRED is caught in the middle between the portal giant and major brokerages like\nCompass\n, which have warned they\u2019ll yank listings from the MLS entirely if the private network goes away. (Many Compass listings are\nalready dodging various MLS\u2019s\nacross the nation altogether as the brokerage promotes an initial phase of exclusive, internal marketing.)\nChicago\u2019s MLS also has a nuclear option: should\nZillow really start to block listings\nthat start out on the private network, MRED has hinted it could declare Zillow in violation of their licensing agreement and cut off Zillow\u2019s access to local homes for sale.\nSo far, MRED has sided with the brokerages. That prompted\nZillow to try dancing around the MLS\n, by asking brokerages to feed it their listings directly.\nIt\u2019s a messy, high-stakes standoff, and one that \u2014 as one of Chicago\u2019s top brokers\nMatt Laricy\npointed out while Zillow dug in its heels this week \u2014 has little to do with helping consumers.\n\u201cCompass only wants the pocket (listings) because they want to keep things in-house\u2026 Then their stock price goes up,\u201d Laricy said in a video posted to social media. \u201cZillow wants everything to go on the website\u2026 they get more leads\u2026 their\nstock price goes up\n. So they\u2019re both just looking out for their pocketbooks. Neither of these are good for the consumer.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right. The MLS wants to do what\u2019s best for the brokerages that make up its paying subscribers, with Compass chief among them, so they keep paying to subscribe. Zillow wants to charge more fees for handing brokers leads. None of their talking points are centered on how to improve the experiences of their actual clients.\nThese kinds of self-interested arguments put forth by corporate entities that profit off the biggest financial decisions most people ever make probably weren\u2019t what consumers and their lawyers had in mind when they agreed to a\n$418 million settlement\nwith the National Association of Realtors that\npromised to reshape\nthe real estate industry\u2019s approach to its clients.\nThe Private Listing Network isn\u2019t exactly a pocket listing haven. Unlike traditional \u201ccoming soon\u201d listings that never see full daylight, the MRED\u2019s private network is viewable by all MRED subscribers \u2014 a fairly wide pool of licensed brokers in the region. But they are invisible to the public and to agents outside the area, which means Zillow can\u2019t access them.\nThat\u2019s the rub.\nNationally,\nZillow has taken a hard stance against pocket listings\n, even suggesting they\ndeepen housing segregation\n. But in this case, it\u2019s accusing MRED of cloaking homes from buyers for brokers\u2019 benefit, while Compass and others argue the network enables marketing flexibility that doesn\u2019t run afoul of local MLS rules.\nMeanwhile, new players are eyeing the prize.\nGoogle has begun \u201cexperimenting\u201d\nwith hosting for-sale listings directly on its platform, potentially reshaping how buyers find homes in the future. CoStar, which owns Homes.com,\nkeeps jabbing Zillow in court\nand intensifying the portal wars.\nFor now, consumers are on the sidelines of a fight that\u2019s supposed to be about their homes. If either side truly wanted to champion transparency or access, they\u2019d start by considering the public\u2019s role in the conversation.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant parcel in northwest Dallas is getting a $35 million luxury reset.\nCrescent Estates Custom Homes, led by Dallas developer\nMehrdad Moayedi\nand operating under his Centurion American Development firm, broke ground on a $35 million townhome project that will bring 31 high-end units to a 2-acre site near Marsh Lane, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The development, called The Residences at Creek Hollow, will be built at 10056 Marsh Lane on land once occupied by a Dallas County government building that was demolished earlier this year.\nThe property languished in vacancy ever since a tornado tore through the area in 2018, damaging the building and its adjoining parking lot, according to the outlet.\nCrescent Estates plans a mix of two- and three-story townhomes ranging from about 1,600 square feet to 2,700 square feet. Unit pricing is projected between $700,000 and $1.2 million, positioning the project above the median pricing of Dallas\u2019 increasingly competitive infill market. Homes are expected to go vertical within six months, with pre-sales targeted for summer 2026.\nMoayedi acquired the property in 2020, sold it a year later and then bought it back in 2024, according to county records. The Dallas Central Appraisal District currently values the land at $1.9 million, a fraction of the anticipated sellout value once developed.\nThe project is a smaller-scale for\nMoayedi\ncompared to the massive master-planned communities for which he is better known. Yet, it fits a familiar pattern: transforming overlooked or obsolete properties into high-end residential offerings. Crescent Estates\u2019 portfolio includes luxury townhome and condo projects, such as Fairmount Place at Turtle Creek, Water\u2019s Edge Condominiums on Lewisville Lake and Westlake Entrada in Westlake. The firm has also taken on trophy renovations, including the sprawling Malouf Estate on Strait Lane.\nInfill sites that once struggled to pencil out are getting a second look as land scarcity and high-end demand push developers to smaller, more boutique projects, according to the outlet.\nWhile modest in unit count, The Residences at Creek Hollow will add to Moayedi\u2019s growing portfolio across North Texas. Centurion American has communities in the pipeline that will deliver thousands of homes in markets including Fort Worth, Denison, Gunter and the\nLake Texoma\narea, along with high-profile hotel redevelopments like the Statler downtown and the former\nCrowne Plaza\nin Addison.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Edward Minskoff and Joseph Moinian are jockeying for Meyer Chetrit to take the blame in a dispute with a lender.\nWhen a lender accused a borrower linked to\nthe three high-profile investors\nof self-dealing and depositing funds into accounts linked to Chetrit, it pushed for a receiver for the property. Now the receiver is saying the borrower never turned over key funds, and Moinian and Minskoff are doing everything they can to cast blame on Chetrit.\nThe courtroom drama is the latest obstacle for the Chetrit family, which is dealing with a\n$132 million judgment\ndue to aggressive lender Maverick Real Estate Partners and criminal charges related to alleged tenant harassment.\nAt the heart of the case are 500 and 512 Seventh Avenue, a Manhattan office complex and home to the Chetrit Group headquarters.\nThe lender claimed the borrower has been self-dealing, transferring about $1 million of tenant security deposits to outside accounts. About $300,000 was transferred to accounts associated with other Chetrit projects or affiliates, according to court documents. Those include LLCs tied to the Chetrits that own property in Hollywood Beach, Florida, and townhomes at 110 and 125 East 64th Streets.\nAnd a court-appointed receiver for the property has accused the borrower of not turning over more than $700,000 in tenant security deposits.\nMoinian and Minskoff have pointed their fingers at Chetrit.\nThe three investors are part of a management committee that controls the borrower, according to court affirmations from Minskoff and Moinian. All material decisions need to be approved by two members \u2014 but one of them needs to be Chetrit.\n\u201cOn multiple occasions, including but not limited to November 18, 2025, I requested that Meyer Chetrit return the security deposits,\u201d reads a statement included in both Minskoff\u2019s and Moinian\u2019s affirmations.\nCourt documents also include messages between an attorney for Moinian and Minkskoff and an attorney for Chetrit. Christian Becker, an attorney with Kasowitz LLP, demanded that the Chetrits turn over the deposits to the receiver.\n\u201cAs you know, Mr. Moinian and Mr. Minskoff had nothing to do with nor did they know about the alleged transfers of any security deposits,\u201d Becker wrote.\nChristopher Gorman, an attorney for Chetrit with Rosenberg &amp; Estis, wrote back that he had forwarded the demand to his clients but that they dispute the contentions.\nIn a court affirmation, Gorman said Chetrit handed over about $363,000 in security deposits, which is the total amount that they possessed at that time.\nBecker declined to comment. Gorman, as well as Minskoff and Moinian, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe three investors are now technically being held in contempt of court for failure to release the deposits. However, correspondence from the receiver to the judge asked that the motion be withdrawn as it relates to Moinian and Minskoff.\nThe official borrower is 500-512 Seventh Avenue LP, which acquired the leasehold on the property in 1999 for $140 million. The entity took out a $375 million loan in 2018, which the three investors agreed to guarantee in the case of specific bad behavior by the borrower.\n512 Seventh Avenue is a 45-story tower with 544,300 rentable square feet, while the 500 property is an 18-story building with 676,500 rentable square feet. 228 West 38th Street, also included on the loan, is a five-story commercial building with 10,000 rentable square feet.",

        "content": "The passing of\nJohn Aaroe\nthis week gave an uncommon pause to the ultra-competitive world of luxury residential real estate.\nIt was enough of a pause for a number of top brokers in town to gather their thoughts and note a key quality that made Aaroe a seminal figure in the rise of the high-end brokerages and brands in LA: He didn\u2019t compete with the agents he recruited to his brokerages.\nInstead of splitting his time leading a business and selling homes, he focused on the former with John Aaroe &amp; Associates and John Aaroe Group. In doing so, he won the respect of those he worked with because he had the time and focus to mentor agents and others at his companies.\nThat\u2019s different from a model many brokerages employ today where founders or those in the C-suite are also still selling. That\u2019s not to say that can\u2019t work. There are a number of brokerages that have a multi-pronged approach to leadership, which has also given way to scale.\nBut, clearly, the way Aaroe operated made a mark on many.\n\u201cHe was a class act and a true legend of the industry,\u201d Westside Estate Agency Executive Vice President and General Manager Colin Keenan said of Aaroe.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman worked at Aaroe\u2019s John Aaroe Group between 2013 and 2016. He considered Aaroe a friend and mentor.\n\u201cMuch of my success can be credited to his guidance, generosity, and unwavering belief in others,\u201d Kirman said in a statement to\nThe Real\nDeal. \u201cHis influence extended far beyond any one organization\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a wrap\nIt started off with\nyells\nbut ended with hardly a whisper.\nThat\u2019s the shorthand on the legal battles that erupted last year in October between Douglas Elliman\u2019s California subsidiaries, along with former managers and executives.\nTwo of the suits, which involved some ugly accusations of\nescrow impropriety\n, were settled fairly quickly in December of last year. A\nthird\ninvolving the firm\u2019s former Newport Beach sales manager, Christina Carrillo, appears to be coming to a close with court documents filed this month showing a\nsettlement reached\nand a request by Carrillo\u2019s attorney for the case to be dismissed.\nThe request will still need to be finalized, but it marks an end to a case involving Carrillo\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and retaliation.\nOutside of the complaints\u2019 severity were the allegations within the lawsuit that painted a picture of a toxic office environment and bad behavior by agents and executives.\nWith a private settlement struck,\u00a0 there is no telling what other details could have emerged had the matter gone to the jury trial that was originally set to start in May.\nLet\u2019s try again\nArdie Tavangarian\u2019s\nVilla Siena\nspec manse in Bel-Air made big waves when it hopped into the market late last year for $177 million.\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether that was aspirational pricing. The market has turned since the roughly 35,000-square-foot 607 Siena Way was listed. Last year might have been flooded with mega deals like Oakley founder\nJim Jannard\nselling his Malibu manse for a state record of $210 million, but a shift took place this year, according to numerous agents and brokers.\nThe data leaves room to dispute the downbeat take.\nThird-quarter, closings on L.A. County properties of $4 million or more spiked 21 percent year-over-year to 497 deals, according to Multiple Listing Service data compiled by Westside Estate Agency. And 2025 has seen two $110 million trades of residences, one at 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air and the other at 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills.\nTavangarian, meanwhile, would top those two even with the 24 percent cut in the price of Villa Siena, which sends the estate back on the market with a $135 million ask. It topped a list of homes added to the county\u2019s inventory for the week ended Dec. 14 in a report by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team.\n",

        "content": "A portfolio of medical offices and safety net hospitals in Chicago and west suburban River Forest are stuck in limbo as investors battle over a total of $89 million in unpaid debt, public records show.\nThe dispute highlights the complexities of investing in real estate backed by safety net hospitals \u2014 which provide care to patients regardless of their insurance and financial status \u2014 and the ripple effect such deals can have on real estate deals and health care access when they go wrong.\nThe wreckage outlined in a December lawsuit was set in motion back in 2019, when El Segundo, California-based\nPipeline Health\nbought Weiss Memorial Hospital in Uptown, West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park and Westlake Hospital in Melrose Park along with associated medical office properties for $70 million.\nSoon after, Pipeline closed West Lake Hospital, and sold a parking lot adjacent to Weiss Memorial to\nWillow Bridge Property Company\n(formerly known as Lincoln Property Group). Willow Bridge redeveloped the property into a 12-story, 303-unit luxury apartment building known as Solverre.\nEnter Princeton, New Jersey-based Resilience Healthcare, led by Manoj Prasad and partner Rathnakar R. Patlola. It\nbought Weiss and West Suburban\nalong with their associated medical properties in a move approved by state regulators in 2022. While the transaction was set to close, Pipeline filed for bankruptcy, temporarily stalling the sale, previous news reports indicate.\nThe deal, which Prasad told media outlets at the time was worth $92 million, eventually closed and was funded in part by a $22 million loan from California-based First Credit Bank and a $67 million loan note with a December 2024 maturity date, public records show.\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by former Pipeline affiliates in Cook County Circuit Court this month, Resilience late last year failed to pay back the $67 million owed to the Pipeline entities.\nAttorneys for Pipeline and representatives of Resilience did not respond to requests for comment.\nSix months after the alleged loan note default, the Center for Medicare Services in June 2025 terminated Weiss Memorial\u2019s participation in Medicaid reimbursement, leaving a massive hole in its budget.\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health had reportedly paid several visits to the properties and found compliance issues in \u201cnursing services, physical environment, and emergency services,\u201d healthcare news outlet Chicago Health reported in August. Specifically, its air conditioning system failed and led to overheating, forcing closures of inpatient rooms. Weiss reportedly received 87 percent of its funding from Medicare and Medicaid in 2024.\nResilience this fall promptly shut down Weiss Memorial, though it still offers some outpatient services, according to its website. West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park remains open.\nPipeline confirmed it re-emerged from bankruptcy in 2023 in a statement on its website, and alleges in its recent legal filing that it bought the medical properties back via a credit bit shortly after issuing Resilience a notice of default in early 2025.\nSince then, Pipeline alleges it should have been in charge of the assets but Resilience had refused to acknowledge the sale. Separately, the other $22 million debt tied to the properties, which was packaged into a commercial mortgage-backed securities offering, is also in trouble.\nResilience fell behind on debt payments in November, according to CMBS tracking platform Morningstar Credit, and it\u2019s headed to special servicing, which usually brings on tougher conditions for borrowers.\nThe\n$67 million debt\nsubject to Pipeline\u2019s lawsuit is listed in public records as a subordinate mortgage, meaning Resilience is likely on the hook to cover the $22 million CMBS debt before making the lenders of the larger debt whole.\nFor now, the tangled legal mess leaves West Suburban Hospital in a precarious situation and puts a heavier burden on Weiss Memorial Hospital\u2019s potential to reopen.\n",

        "content": "Compass is moving south.\nThe brokerage giant, which has\naggressively consolidated market share\nacross Chicago\u2019s North Side and suburbs over the last few years, is partnering with a top independent firm in Beverly and Morgan Park to debut its first office on the\nSouth Side\nof Chicago.\nThe seven-agent Town Group \u2014 formerly known as Town Realty Chicago \u2014 is joining Compass and bringing its Morgan Park-based brick-and-mortar shop at 10938 South Western Avenue along with it, according to a Compass press release. The office will be Compass\u2019 first location south of River North.\nThe team will remain independently owned, lead agent Meg Mulrenin said, while working under the Compass brand. The team will work under Compass\u2019 managing broker Andy Shiparski.\nMulrenin said joining Compass was the next step for the growth of her team, which she and her business partner Matt McGinnis founded in 2020. Town Realty closed $30 million in sales in 2024 and is on track for $20 million in sales in 2025, Mulrenin said. That volume puts it among the top brokerages in both Morgan Park and Beverly, she said.\nMulrenin had received pitches to join other brokerages before, she said, and she usually brushed them off. She initially did the same to Compass, but after sitting down with the team, she said she was impressed.\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t seeking out a partnership with anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cCompass found me, and the opportunity fell in my lap and made a ton of sense. We\u2019ve done really well in the last five years capturing our little market here. I feel like we\u2019ve grown it as far as we can with the resources available to us.\u201d\nMulrenin has deep ties in the far south neighborhoods, where she was born and raised. Her team\u2019s \u201cTown\u201d moniker is a nod to her family, which owned Town Liquors in the neighborhood for almost 40 years.\n\u201cEveryone calls us the \u2018Town family,'\u201d Mulrenin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a really strong presence in this community for decades.\u201d\nWhile The Town Group is remaining independently owned, the move highlights the pressure for independent brokerages to keep up in a business dominated by large national companies. Compass finalized its purchase of Chicago-based\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nat the beginning of this year, adding the city\u2019s largest brokerage to its portfolio. Compass\u2019 move to buy Anywhere Real Estate will\nbring more of Chicago\u2019s top firms\nunder its umbrella.\nCompass\u2019 tech platform and office-exclusive marketing strategy, which have drawn criticism from competitors and websites like Zillow, were part of what drew the team to Compass, Mulrenin said. She said she\u2019s interested in growing the team going forward.\n\u201cI think Compass will be a huge draw to get the people that we have wanted to come on board,\u201d Mulrenin said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help us court more talent.\u201d\nMulrenin began her real estate career in 2011 at @properties. She worked for Coldwell Banker and another small firm in Beverly before starting her own firm in 2020.\n",

He previously led Skender\u2019s Interiors group and a group of leaders known as the company\u2019s \u201cMission Critical\u201d team.\nBukowski worked closely with\nAndy Halik,\nwho was promoted to president from senior vice president, the release shows. He has been with Skender since 2011.\nThe company also named a new president of its Indiana operations,\nBrian Simmons\n. Simmons joined Skender in 2007 and has been working on its expansion in the Indianapolis area since 2020.\nThe Interiors group at Skender gained a new vice president,\nAshley Pforr,\naccording to the release. Pforr previously served as the Interior group\u2019s project executive. She has led construction teams at Skender since 2010.\nRosemont-based commercial brokerage\nLee &amp; Associates\nhas been on a\nhiring and promoting spree\nthe past few months, and announced it would launch a new health care real estate division.\nTo establish the new team, Lee &amp; Associates brought on three new brokers. Principals Peter Cangialosi and Doug Pauly, and associate Austin York joined Lee &amp; Associates from Oak Brook-based brokerage Joseph Ross &amp; Associates, according to a press release.\nCangialosi joins with 20 years of experience, including 10 years dedicated solely to health care real estate. Pauly also brings 20 years of experience to the position, and has completed more than $100 million in deals, the release shows. York joins with about 10 years of experience, including with the National Association of Realtors, Redfin and Second Century Ventures.\nAustin-based brokerage\nRelive Realty\nplans to expand to Chicago in 2026, according to the firm\u2019s spokesperson. The firm previously expanded to Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. The company employs brokers for both renters and homebuyers. It is actively recruiting agents in Chicago, a spokesperson said.",

        "content": "Billionaires are trading properties from Miami to Manalapan as the year comes to a close.\nWhile many agents tell me the market\u2019s a bit quiet, it feels like I\u2019m hearing about a new major deal every day.\nIn Manalapan, Dr. Herbert Wertheim (the world\u2019s wealthiest optometrist)\npaid $65 million\n, furniture included, for a nearly 28,000-square-foot mansion at 1160 South Ocean Boulevard. It\u2019s not the biggest we\u2019ve reported on, but it does mark the priciest above $60 million in Manalapan since billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison paid $173 million for an oceanfront estate in 2022. (This deal made it in the nick of time inside our top\n10 resi sales of 2025 story\n.)\nSort of close by \u2014 about a 30-minute drive \u2014 William Wrigley Jr. (of the chewing gum fortune) sold his 2.5-acre estate at 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road in North Palm Beach. The buyer, fintech billionaire Ronald Clarke,\npaid $97.5 million\nfor the property. It\u2019s a record for North Palm Beach.\nDown in Miami, billionaire MasTec chairman Jorge Mas sold a 7.3-acre waterfront property in Coconut Grove earlier this month\nfor more than $100 million\n. More recently, Mas, who is a part owner of Inter Miami, sold his nearby waterfront Coral Gables home\nfor $32 million\n. The buyers in both deals are a mystery, but I did hear from sources that the buyer of the $100 million-plus deal plans to build a 50,000-square-foot mansion.\nPending contracts also suggest there\u2019s more brewing. In Palm Beach, coffee magnate Bob Stiller\ninked a deal\nto sell his lakefront mansion, asking $84 million. And back in Coconut Grove, a 4.5-acre waterfront estate also secured a buyer. The seller is the estate of the late prominent Miami restaurateur Jonathan Lewis (of Cafe Tu Tu Tango days). I heard the buyer is another billionaire \u2014 more to come on that this week.\nThe question is, will this momentum carry into the new year? I think so.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nBillionaire developer Steve Ross scored a record\n$772 million in construction financing\nfor two office projects in West Palm. Is this a positive indicator of the office market\u2019s strength, or a one-off deal that speaks more to Ross\u2019 plans and reputation?\nSend me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nWilliam Wrigley Jr.\nsold the 2.5-acre waterfront estate at 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road in North Palm Beach for $97.5 million. The buyer was\nfintech billionaire Ronald Clarke\n.\nCommercial:\nIn Boca Raton, the Publix-anchored Polo Club Shops at 5050 Champion Boulevard traded\nfor $83 million\n, or about $600 per square foot. The seller of the site was Atlanta-based Jamestown. The new owner is Publix.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nBusinesswoman Ann DesRuisseaux listed her landmarked Palm Beach mansion, fresh off an extensive renovation, for $175 million. The 923 Venetian-style estate at 800 South County Road previously sold for just $24 million in 2020. The 1.5-acre property, fronting the Intracoastal Waterway, has 200 feet of waterfront and sits just north of President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club. It\u2019s on the market with Margit Brandt of Premier Estate Properties.\nElsewhere in Florida\nMore than 40 \u201ccritically missing children\u201d from 14 North Florida counties were recovered during a two-week, multiagency operation led by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to\nUSA Today\n.\nA former Brightline conductor filed a lawsuit against the rail company and its parent, Fortress Investment Group, for $60 million, alleging repeated exposure to fatal crashes left him with severe psychological injuries, the\nMiami Herald reports\n. Darren J. Brown Jr.\u2019s federal lawsuit alleges that Brightline fostered a culture that normalized deaths, discouraged mental-health support and failed to make timely safety upgrades.\nLawmakers are considering two bills that would give developments of over 10,000 acres the ability to be approved administratively, bypassing the public hearing process, if developers set aside 60 percent of the land for conservation. But the bills don\u2019t require the conserved land to be in one place or remain in its natural state, according to\nWLRN\nand\nFlorida Politics\n.",

        "content": "For all of the momentum coursing through San Francisco this year, one critical facet of its real estate market remains stuck in the mud: New housing projects.\nThe city is garnering renewed global interest, drawing plentiful venture capital money, and has an apparently pro-housing and development philosophy steering its political infrastructure. Yet none of that has led it to meet its goals on actually building housing.\nMore than 20,000 new housing units have been approved\nin San Francisco, but little dirt has moved. In 2024, the city greenlit plans for just over 2,400 new homes, a rounding error compared to the 82,000 homes the state has mandated San Francisco permit by 2031.\nTariffs, construction costs driven up by inflation, and the relatively high interest rates of recent years shoulder some of the blame, developers say.\nYet, San Francisco\u2019s improvements from the low-point of the pandemic continue to spur interest in existing multifamily assets, with sales up 35 percent year-over-year according to data firm Avison Young. The trend is likely to hold until the market for new builds picks up, with more high-dollar trades of older residential buildings along the lines of a couple from the past week.\nBridge Capital Partners Inc., is under contract to\nbuy the Sunset Towers,\na two-building, 243-unit property in the Sunset neighborhood just south of Golden Gate Park. Sold by AvalonBay Communities, the property had listed earlier this summer and was reportedly drawing bids of more than $100 million,\naccording to the San Francisco Business Times.\nThe sides have not made the final sale price public. The deal is expected to close in January.\nVeritas Investments, one of the largest landlords in San Francisco, has been dealing with financial troubles by offloading significant portions of its residential portfolio over the last two years. The latest update in the saga came earlier in the week, when the Canadian RBC Real Estate Capital Corporation sold a $570 million loan,\nbacked by 66 apartment buildings owned by Veritas\n. The buyer, an affiliate of Revere Housing, will take control of the real estate, but retain Veritas as a property manager.\nVeritas previously let go of 76 apartment buildings in San Francisco to a partnership between Ballast Investments and Brookfield through a foreclosure, after the companies bought a pair of troubled Veritas loans for $615 million in 2024. Earlier this year, Los Angeles-based investment firm PCCP\nacquired another 76 apartment buildings\nin Oakland and San Francisco from Veritas for just over $540 million.\nA prominent single-family property in the Bay Area also had movement this week: the $6 million home of embattled Sonoma developer Ken Mattson, who is facing charges for an alleged $46 million Ponzi scheme. A judge late last week ordered that\nMattson surrender the $6 million Piedmont home as part of his bail bond\n.\nMattson was\ncuffed in a Napa parking lot earlier this year\non allegations that he sold fake ownership stakes in residential and commercial properties to investors, over a period of 15 years. During that time, he amassed a robust Sonoma County real estate portfolio worth upwards of $80 million.\n",

        "content": "The Dallas real estate world has just six months left to savor the crispy onions at Sevy\u2019s Grill in Preston Hollow.\nThe popular power lunch spot, whose chopped salad is served under a pile of fried alliums that could inspire poetry, announced that it\u2019s closing in June.\nOwners Jim and Amy Severson said they were unable to reach an agreement on their next lease, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The mixed-use building, at 8201 Preston Road, was picked up by Austin-based Endeavor Real estate in September.\nIn other words: Endeavor raised the rent.\nThe company, best known for its multifamily properties in Austin, made Preston Sherry Plaza, longtime home to Sevy\u2019s, its first mixed-use buy in Dallas. The seven-story building constructed in 1986 features two levels of retail and five stories of office space.\nThe Seversons opened Sevy\u2019s Grill at the Preston Hollow property in 1997. In its 28-year run, the restaurant has become a magnet for business lunches, especially among the Dallas real estate world \u2014 to the extent that it\u2019s never a bad idea to lower your voice if you\u2019re, say, talking to a reporter or cutting a deal.\nThe restaurant said in a Facebook post that its last day will be June 27. But, there may be hope for continued enjoyment of those crispy onions: the Seversons are already scouting for a new location.\nVirgin Hotels asks court to name Bill Hutchinson\u2019s accusers\nDisgraced developer Bill Hutchinson, who\u2019s been accused of sexual assault by at least five women (including a minor), is still fighting a civil lawsuit filed by three Dallas women who say the Virgin Hotel Dallas developer assaulted them. The accusers named Virgin Hotels, claiming the company had knowledge of Hutchinson\u2019s pattern of preying upon women at the hotel and assaulting him at the apartment complex he owned across the street in Dallas\u2019 Design District. In its latest filing, the hotel chain\nasked the court to publicly name\nthe women. Virgin Hotels said the protective order in place allows the accusers to \u201canonymously prosecute salacious claims.\u201d Note: this is all taking place after Hutchinson took a plea deal in a Laguna Beach sexual assault case that required him to register as a sex offender.\nHome values diverge in Metroplex cities\nDallas and Fort Worth are often (misguidedly) treated as one city, and this metric was another example of the fact that the two poles of the Metroplex are far from interchangeable.\nHome values in Dallas and Fort Worth\ndiverged drastically in November, with Dallas posting gains of almost 12 percent, while Fort Worth values fell 6 percent. The median listing price of a home in Dallas was $458,000 and $318,500 in Fort Worth, according to the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\nDon\u2019t Texas my California?\nWe usually think of the California-to-Texas pipeline being a one-way street, but a recent piece in the San Francisco Standard is challenging that notion.\nTexas-based investors\nrepresent an increasing number of out-of-state buyers for San Francisco commercial spaces, the outlet\nreported\n. This year, Houston-based developer Hines and Dallas-based investors Lone Star Funds and Douglas McMahon have picked up properties in San Francisco in the last year or so. The wave coincides with an influx of tech workers and artificial intelligence companies moving into San Francisco, helping thaw the previously frozen commercial market.\nAustin multifamily picks up a shovel\nAfter\na deluge of supply outstripped demand in the Austin multifamily market, developers have been scared away from turning dirt on new projects. But it looks like they\u2019re counting on better fundamentals in 2028.\nLV Collective\n, formerly known as Lincoln Ventures, is moving forward with a mixed-use project in Austin that\u2019s been stalled for three years. The developer looks to be playing it a little safer than originally planned, having trimmed down the project\u2019s multifamily unit count from 625 to 476. The Right Angle, at 2700 East Fifth Street, is expected to be completed in September 2028.\n",

Trainor Jr., Vicki L. Trainor and Kevin Killerman owns the building, records show. The historic building was completed in 1923 and renovated in 2016, the release says.\nSimpro Group | Miami\nSimpro Group, a firm that uses AI to simplify and power contractor jobs at commercial and residential properties, will open its North America headquarters in downtown Miami.\nSimpro, based in Brisbane, Australia, will open on the 26th floor at the One Downtown office tower at 1 Southeast Third Avenue, with the first employees expected to move in in February, according to the tenant\u2019s news release.

Voccola is the former CEO of Miami-based AI-powered cybersecurity and IT management firm Kaseya.\nHis goal is to scale Simpro\u2019s Miami employment to more than 500 staff members, according to the release. Simpro provides AI software to contractors such as plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and fire safety professionals.\nSimpro will put its company signage at One Downtown as part of its deal.\nLos Angeles-based PCCP bought the 31-story tower, previously called SunTrust International Center, for\n$127 million\nin 2018.\nThe lease gives a boost to Miami officials\u2019 yearslong push to turn the city into a tech mecca. Despite the hype in recent years, with the catchphrase \u201cSilicon Valley South\u201d gaining steam, tech leasing doesn\u2019t represent a significant chunk of\noffice occupancy and demand\n, data shows.\nUniversity of Miami | Miami-Dade County\nThe University of Miami signed a big office lease at the Flagler Station business park.\nCoral Gables-based UM leased 42,000 square feet at Building 1300 at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to the landlord\u2019s news release.

Seller Bridge Investment sold the distressed three-property portfolio while facing a foreclosure suit from its lender.\nHamilton Development plans to replace the buildings at 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue with warehouses, but it will keep the office building where UM leased at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue.\nCDM Windows &amp; Door | Doral\nAn impact windows and doors company will move to a bigger industrial space in the Doral area.\nCDM Windows &amp; Doors, an impact glass manufacturer that also installs the systems at commercial and residential properties, leased the entire 40,800-square-foot warehouse at 10405 Northwest 19th Street in Doral, according to a news release from the landlord\u2019s broker.\nThe lease, which starts in February, is an expansion for CDM from its previous space of roughly 27,000 square feet in the Doral submarket, said Michael Hinton, the Lee &amp; Associates broker who represented the landlord in the deal.\nCDM listed its current Doral warehouse at 8301 Northwest 27th Street.\nEmre Tuna, through an affiliate, completed the 10405 Northwest 19th Street building last year on a 2.3-acre site, property records show.\nTortilla Madre | Miami\nMexican restaurant Tortilla Madre opened in Brickell.\nTortilla Madre leased 990 square feet at 28 Southwest 11th Street in a commercial unit at the Millecento condo tower in Miami, according to a news release from FA Commercial.

        "content": "It took until nearly the end of the year, but Santa Monica has a new market leader in 2025.\nA home at 2555 La Mesa Drive sold for just shy of $23 million on Dec. 11, knocking two single-family homes, which each went for $14.6 million, off their perch.\nOn La Mesa Drive, the recent deal was for a 10,317-square-foot home behind private gates, with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, equating to $2,224 per square foot. The property was listed on Aug. 21, with an initial asking price of just under $25 million, according to The Agency\u2019s Amir Jawaherian, who represented the seller, Los Angeles-based developer Peter Bakhitiari of Maison by PGB.\nAfter purchasing the home for $6.5 million in December 2021, Bakhitiari \u201creimagined the property into a super-sustainable modern architectural home that combines strong design, privacy and livability,\u201d Jawaherian said.\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s James Mormile and Kurt Rappaport represented the buyer, which appears to be a trust linked to Nashville consultancy Oberon Solutions.\nThe net-zero estate includes a motor court framed by cascading water walls and a reflecting pool, a resort-style pool, a skylit atrium, expansive walls of glass, a private speakeasy lounge, a state-of-the-art movie theater and private terraces. Included is a detached guest house and private gym as well as a four-car conditioned garage.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. Given that the fourth quarter is incomplete,\nThe Real Deal\nranked the top sales for the first three quarters of the year using Los Angeles County tax assessor data. You can see the top 10 single-family sales in Santa Monica for the first nine months of the year by clicking here.\nIn May, 457 20th Street sold for $14.6 million. At 6,763 square feet, the house went for $2,151 per square foot. Outfitted with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, the house sits on a 8,952-square-foot lot. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate SoCal\u2019s Cynthia Ambuehl and Luca Diamont listed the property. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Marco Salari and Brent Watson represented the buyer.\nThe residence was designed by renowned architect Hagy Belzberg. Called \u201cScreen House\u201d due to its handcrafted, porous facade of custom-molded composite blocks, the fully furnished home has a subterranean courtyard with olive tree, chef-caliber kitchen, entertainment suite, elevator and spa-inspired amenities. The basement boasts a screening room, sauna, steam room and gym. The original asking price, on Jan. 13, was $19.5 million, per Salari.\nThree months earlier,\n628 25th Street\nsold for the same sum, but at a lower price per square foot. At 7,692 square feet, the home with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms went for $1,892 per square foot. Features at 628 25th Street include a floating staircase and an elevator, a formal living room centered around a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, a chef\u2019s kitchen, a butler\u2019s pantry and a temperature-controlled wine fridge. Smith &amp; Berg\u2019s F. Ron Smith and David Berg marketed the property. The Agency\u2019s Jaime Cuevas worked on behalf of the buyer.\n",

        "content": "The siren song of Y\u2019all Street continues to call financial services companies to Uptown Dallas, but 2025 was the year of the suburbs.\nLeases in the satellite cities surrounding Dallas and Fort Worth \u2014 Plano, Frisco, The Colony \u2014 made up eight of the 10 biggest lease deals of the year, allowing the region\u2019s sluggish office market to make some gains toward market recovery.\nVacancy in the region inched down to 25 percent from 25.3 percent in the third quarter, year-over-year, according to a release from Partners Real Estate. Net absorption in the third quarter was positive, too, with the rate surpassing 1 million square feet.\nHere are the biggest office leases of the year, using data from CBRE, Newmark and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nLockheed Martin | 5555 North Beach Street | 455,400 square feet\nThe\ndefense contractor\u2019s lease\nisn\u2019t just the biggest of the year, it\u2019s the largest in a decade, JLL\nsaid\n. Lockheed Martin renewed its 455,400-square-foot lease until August 2031 at Fossil Creek Park, an office campus in north Fort Worth owned by Doug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial. The deal involving the Class B office property, at 5555 North Beach Street, bucks the market trend of flight to quality, with Lockheed staying put in a building constructed in 1996.\nPennyMac | 5025 Plano Parkway | 300,000 square feet\nPennyMac is hopping from one DFW suburb to another. The Los Angeles-based mortgage lender traded its Plano office for a\nfull building lease in Carrollton\n. Pennymac outgrew its 76,000-square-foot lease at the Plano Corporate Center East building, at 2201 West Plano Parkway. It inked a deal to occupy the 300,000-square-foot building at 5025 Plano Parkway, a property that pharmaceutical company AmerisourceBergen put on the sublease market two years ago. Dallas-based Billingsley Company developed the building in 2019 and still owns it. PennyMac will initially occupy 150,000 square feet of the office building and expand to 300,000 square feet. The company\u2019s Carrollton hub will bring in 1,800 new jobs.\nToyota Financial Services | 4401 Cirrus Way | 241,500 square feet\nThe fact that Toyota Financial Services is moving to a timber office building is almost as notable as the fact that the deal is the area\u2019s third-largest office lease of the year. The company signed a lease for the\n242,000-square-foot Offices at Southstone Yards\n, at 4401 Cirrus Way. Crow Holdings developed the seven-story building as part of Southstone Yards, a 45-acre mixed-use development. The office property is also the region\u2019s first timber-framed office building in a century.\nIntegrity Marketing Group | 1445 Ross Avenue | 185,233 square feet\nIt\u2019s not all bad news in downtown Dallas. The urban core has been shedding office users for decades now, but Integrity Marketing Group\u2019s expansion goes against the grain. The insurance provider in 2021 traded its office digs in Cypress Waters for a spot at Fountain Place. Now it\u2019s expanding its space from 100,000 square feet to 185,000 square feet at the downtown tower at 1445 Ross Avenue. It\u2019s owned by Atlanta-based Goddard Investment Group.\nAT&amp;T | 2221 Lakeside Boulevard | 179,700 square feet\nDowntown Dallas office mainstay AT&amp;T has been teasing a\npossible exit\n, citing public safety\nissues in the urban core\n. Rumors are swirling that the telecommunication giant is scouting a suburban office \u2014 but that could also be an effort to get a bigger incentive\nboost from the city\nto stay. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T\nincreased its presence in Richardson\nwith a 186,000-square-foot lease at Lakeside Boulevard Tower, at 2221 Lakeside Boulevard. The expansion reflects AT&amp;T\u2019s consolidation of regional offices at the RIchardson outpost. The 807,000-square-foot building is owned by Dallas-based Provident Realty Advisors, which plans to invest nearly $16 million in upgrades.\nGeico | 2375 North Glenville Drive | 165,107 square feet\nIn another win for Richardson, Geico\ndoubled its office space\nin the Dallas suburb. Mapletree Investments owns the Galatyn Commons complex where the insurer signed a 165,000-square-foot lease. Singapore-based Mapletree bought the building at 2375 North Glenville Drive in 2022. Geico also occupies 233,000 square feet at the former Fossil headquarters, at 2280 North Greenville Avenue.\nWeWork/Amazon | 6535 North State Highway 161 | 154,600 square feet\nAmazon partnered with WeWork to take over a McKesson-owned property in Irving. The partners leased 154,600 square feet at 6535 North State Highway 161. The 272,000-square-foot office building was constructed in 2001 and has six stories.\nSally Beauty | 7900 Windrose Avenue | 144,517 square feet\nSally Beauty reportedly turned down incentives from the city of Denton to keep its headquarters in the city and\nhopped over to Plano\n. The Fortune 1000 beauty retailer inked a deal to move 600 employees into a 140,000-square-foot space in Liberty Mutual\u2019s office building at Legacy West after 40 years in Denton. The new space at 7900 Windrose Avenue represents a downsizing from the company\u2019s previous space, a 200,000-square-foot building at 3001 Colorado Boulevard.\nScotiabank | 2601 Victory Avenue | 133,700 square feet\nCanadian lender Scotiabank was considering planting a U.S. office in Charlotte, but ultimately\nchose Dallas\nin what\u2019s shaping up to be a win for the rise of Y\u2019all Street. The city of Dallas offered Scotiabank nearly $5 million in incentives to come to the Big D. Scotiabank signed a lease to occupy 100,000 square feet at Hillwood\u2019s Victory Commons One, at 2601 Victory Avenue in Uptown Dallas.\nEnergy Transfer | 8020 Park Lane | 120,923 square feet\nIn the same year that Rick Perry\u2019s Energy Transfer took Greenpeace to court, it inked a lease at an office building within The Shops at Park Lane. The energy company took 121,000 square feet at the five-story office building at 8020 Park Lane. It was built in 2015 and is owned by Northwood Investors.\n",

It\u2019s taking over 30,000 square feet on the second floor of the Pioneer Building, previously occupied by coworking competitor Regus.\nIt\u2019s one vote of confidence in the borough\u2019s coworking market and the idea that white-collar Brooklynites are willing to pay for office space near them.\nJuda Srour said he expects workers from the area\u2019s new residential towers to become customers.\n\u201cThe entire area is really changing with all these brand new developments,\u201d Srour said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to work in the area because they live in the area,\u201d he said of residents.\nThe space will feature 65 private office units, four meeting rooms and access to a building roof deck. Other tenants in the building include Blick Art Materials and UPS, according to the building\u2019s website. The building is owned by Quinlan Development Group, according to its website. The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe outerborough office market has failed to have a Manhattan-style comeback. The private sector in particular has stayed away from Brooklyn and Queens: A majority of 2025\u2019s\ntop office leases in the boroughs\nwere government agencies and schools.\nAnd Jay Suites has also stuck close to the city\u2019s center, with its previous 12 locations in Manhattan.\nBut coworking relies on different dynamics, hoping to capture white-collar remote workers who want to get out of the house but still stay local.\nJay Suites typically leases its space but has also dabbled in purchasing. In 2024, the company\npaid $35 million\nfor the Class B,142,000-square-foot office building at 8 West 38th Street, according to property records. The price for the 12-story, 1913 building came out to about $250 per square foot.\nIn addition to Jay Suites, the company also operates Jay Conference locations for meetings and events. Srour said leadership hopes to open a conference location in Brooklyn as well.\n\u201cThe goal would be to build a hub,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s City Council overruled Mayor Brandon Johnson in dramatic fashion on Saturday, approving a 2026 budget that scraps his proposed corporate head tax and commits more cash to the city\u2019s deeply underfunded pension systems.\nThe 30-18 vote capped weeks of infighting and marked a rare power grab by a coalition of mostly moderate and conservative aldermen, who wrested control of the budget process from the mayor\u2019s office, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Their plan removes Johnson\u2019s $33-per-employee monthly head tax on large companies with 500 or more employees, and accelerates pension payments in hopes of shoring up the city\u2019s balance sheet and avoiding another credit downgrade.\nThe tax, based on one\nenacted in 1973\nand eliminated under Rahm Emanuel in 2014, charged companies with 50 employees or more $4 per worker per month at the time, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, as well as the Institute for the Public Good, which produced a policy paper in September in support of the proposal.\nThe concept was derided by the city\u2019s business community as an\nanti-growth penalty\n. The Illinois Policy Institute came out against the head tax, as did the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this summer.\nWhile the budget could still be tweaked later this year or into 2026, the message was clear: Any changes will now flow through the City Council, not the mayor\u2019s office. Alderman Pat Dowell, the 3rd Ward Democrat who backed the plan, called it a \u201cliving document\u201d that can be amended as needed.\nJohnson floated the possibility of a line item veto, though he\u2019s sent mixed signals. Overriding a veto would require 34 votes \u2014 a threshold the Council bloc doesn\u2019t yet have but believes it can reach. Alderman Gilbert Villegas warned that a veto would equate to a shut down, arguing some holdouts would back the budget rather than risk starting the year without one.\nThe death of the head tax spares large office users and employers a new levy, a key concern as downtown vacancies remain elevated. But the budget also includes higher taxes on rideshare trips and alcohol sales, and most notably, a jump in the city\u2019s\nlease tax\nto 15 percent from 11 percent.\nThat tax hits a broad swath of activity, from cloud computing contracts to construction equipment rentals, adding costs for developers, owners and tenants alike.\nJohnson\nblasted the Council plan as fiscally shaky, arguing it relies on overestimated revenues, legally questionable taxes and unworkable spending cuts that could blow a $176 million hole midyear. He also sharply criticized a plan to sell off delinquent city debt to private collectors, a move he said would disproportionately hit low-income residents.\nEven without a veto, the fight isn\u2019t over. Johnson and his allies could push amendments before year-end, while aldermen are already eyeing Springfield to petition for expanded taxing authority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It\u2019s unclear when the apartment last traded, though a Streeteasy listing description for the property noted it\u2019s been several decades.\nThe co-op spans more than 4,400 square feet and has four bedrooms, six bathrooms and a staff room. It also features views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nAmenities in the 45-residence building include a rooftop deck, full-time doormen, a porte-cochere and garage.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Kathy Sloane and Sami Hassoumi had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was a townhouse attached to 40 East End Avenue, a 29-unit project\ndeveloped by Lightstone\n. The townhouse, also called a maisonette, last asked $9.7 million, down from its $10 million price tag when it hit the market in 2020.\nThe triplex home spans 4,900 square feet and has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and an elevator. It also features a private street entrance and a garden.\nAmenities in the building, built in 2019, include a fitness center, library and catering kitchen. The 17-story condominium was designed by TenBerke Architects\u2019 Deborah Berke, who is the dean of the Yale School of Architecture.\nA team with the Corcoran Group heads sales at the project, which launched in 2018. The sponsor is still searching for a buyer for a penthouse at the building, now asking just under $10 million after hitting the market for $10.6 million seven years ago.\nOf the 21 properties, 12 were condos, six were co-ops, two were condos and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes asked a combined $137 million, which works out to an average price of $6.5 million and a median of $5.5 million. The typical home was on the market for nearly two years and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

Property records show San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners sold the nearly 1-acre complex.\nThe trade breaks down to about $330,000 per room, or about $430 per square foot. The price includes furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nThe deal is a return to Miami Beach for Le Guennec, who\nbought and sold\na smaller Washington Avenue hotel years ago. Le Guennec owns a collection of 10 hotels in Paris. He plans to brand and manage the Angler\u2019s himself eventually, said commercial agent\nSusan Gale\nof Gale International at One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Gale represented the buyer in the latest sale, alongside attorney Chad Freedman of Ballaga, Freedman &amp; Atkins.\nAlex Lalos of Hodges Ward Elliott represented the seller.\nThe Angler\u2019s includes two pools, three food and beverage outlets, an underground parking garage, 2.400 square feet of retail event space, and 1,100 square feet of meeting space, Gale said. The property sold in 2013 for $5.4 million. The previous owners built a five-story addition in 2018.\nThe buyer, who financed the purchase with 50 percent financing, plans to spend millions of dollars to renovate the property. The original structure was built in 1923 and 1930.\nGale said the deal was \u201cvery competitive\u201d and is indicative of an increase in demand for hotels. She\u2019s seeing more prospective buyers from Europe.\nPrior to this deal, \u201cthere haven\u2019t been that many sales,\u201d Gale said. Many hotel sellers haven\u2019t been realistic about pricing, she added.\nThe priciest sale of an operating hotel \u2014 not for redevelopment \u2014 in Miami-Dade County this year was the $300 million trade of East Miami at Brickell City Center. Trinity Investments and Certares sold the 352-key hotel to Blackstone. The deed was\nrecorded at $147.8 million\n, which likely excluded what Blackstone paid for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\n",

The real work is set to begin.\nCity Council gave final approval last week to Totem\u2019s plans for a two-acre site surrounding the Broadway Junction transportation hub in Brooklyn, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Construction is expected to begin early next year.\nThe project, known as\nHerkimer-Williams\n, has been in the making since 2021. That\u2019s when Totem, led by Vivian Liao and Tucker Reed, filed preliminary plans for the site. Since then, hundreds of meetings with residents and stakeholders yielded changes, including reducing the maximum height of the buildings from 405 feet to 345 feet.\nThe \u201cvote by the City Council marks a historic milestone not just for Herkimer-Williams, but for the future of East New York,\u201d Liao said in a statement.\nThe development is slated to include almost 1,000 affordable housing units, an increase from the roughly 600 proposed earlier. There will also be 25,000 square feet of public open space, 85,000 square feet of community facility space \u2014 to be anchored by a higher education institution \u2014 114,000 square feet of retail space, 440,000 square feet of commercial space and 100,000 square feet of industrial space.\nThe 10-year development plan is expected to unfold in four phases. The first phase will include the public space and roughly 200 of the affordable units.\nThe project falls outside of the borders of the controversial East New York rezoning, hence Totem\u2019s need for its own rezoning. The wider rezoning has yet to\npan out\nand has fallen short of expected housing goals.\nMeanwhile, roughly $500 million in city and state funding was recently announced for Broadway Junction to improve accessibility, safety and open space, an eye towards unlocking the potential of the area.\nElsewhere in East New York, Gotham Organization, Monadnock Development and nonprofit Christian Cultural Center\nscored a $315 million loan\nin April for their project at 12020 Flatlands Avenue. The loan will fund the construction of 453 rental units at the site, which used to be a vacant parking lot at the church\u2019s 10-and-a-half-acre Brooklyn campus.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A 25-year-old developer is making a bold move on North Texas\u2019 northward march, aiming to complete a 1,300-home master-planned community in\nPilot Point\n, a small but fast-rising city halfway between Dallas and the Oklahoma border.\nCameron Castaldo, founder of One Mark Advisors, closed on 363 acres for $27 million earlier this month and plans to transform the site into Maverick Farms, a sprawling neighborhood with roughly 1,348 homes, trails, a lake-style water feature and two amenity centers,\naccording\nto the Dallas Business Journal. His firm purchased the land, at 12255 Mustang Road, from Ari-Tex Electric on Nov. 4.\nCastaldo entered real estate as a teenager, skipped college, built capital through residential and land sales and launched One Mark Advisors in 2023.\nThe project will roll out in four phases over the next decade, with full buildout targeted for mid-2036. Castaldo broke ground in November and expects to deliver the first 539 finished lots to homebuilders by the end of 2026. CastleRock Communities,\nMattamy Homes\nand David Weekley Homes are signed on for the first phase, with marketing underway for a fourth builder next year, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\nHomes will sit on 40-, 50- and 60-foot lots, with floor plans ranging from about 1,600 square feet to 4,000 square feet. Entry-level pricing is expected to start at about $280,000, the publication reported, undercutting Pilot Point\u2019s average home value of roughly $338,000, according to Zillow, and reinforcing the area\u2019s appeal to buyers priced out of closer-in suburbs.\nTotal development costs are projected at $90 million to $95 million, with Castaldo pegging the community\u2019s full buildout value at about $548 million. Trez Capital provided acquisition and development financing, while KFM Engineering &amp; Design is serving as development consultant and engineer, according to the Dallas Business Journal. Lenart Development is the general contractor.\nBeyond homes and amenities, Maverick Farms will include a regional wastewater treatment plant designed to support future growth north of the site, a piece of infrastructure that could make the project a catalyst for additional development.\nPilot Point, with a population of about 6,800, sits near some of the Metroplex\u2019s hottest growth corridors. Celina, just to the southeast, has ranked among the nation\u2019s fastest-growing cities, while\nSherman\nto the north is seeing a multibillion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing boom. Other developers and retailers, including Green Brick Partners,\nCenturion American\nand H-E-B, have already planted flags nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final price is $10 million lower than the condo\u2019s last asking price when it\nsnagged a signed contract\nin August 2024. It\u2019s also significantly less than the $70 million it sought when the developers launched sales in 2013.\nThe condo spans the 42nd and 43rd floors and has four bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two staff rooms. It also features a terrace, views of the East River and a 33-foot swimming pool.\nA team with Zeckendorf Marketing led sales at the building, while Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jessica Levine brought the buyer.\nSpokespeople for the developers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Levine declined to comment on the sale.\nWilliam and Arthur Zeckendorf bought the site for $160 million in 2007, though construction on the 88-unit building\nstalled for years\nafter the sale due to the Great Recession. The tower, designed by Foster + Partners, was completed in 2015. It includes amenities such as a fitness center, pool and children\u2019s playroom.\nThe developers initially targeted a sellout above $710 million, but by 2020, that was lowered to around $640 million. At the time, the city was\nsaturated with new development condos\n, leaving many to languish on the market while others remained unlisted and vacant.\nThe building, across the street from the United Nations\u2019 Visitors Services wing and just a few blocks away from its headquarters, has attracted a number of diplomats and foreign dignitaries.\nIn 2020, the nation of Kuwait dropped\n$16.1 million\non an apartment at the building to serve as the private residence of the country\u2019s New York-based consul general, Hamad Al-Hazeem. The year prior, the British Consulate-General in New York also paid about\n$16 million\nfor a condo on the 38th floor, while the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar shelled out\n$45 million\nfor four units in 2015.\nOther notable buyers at the tower include the former president of Kohl\u2019s, Jay Baker, and his wife, Pat, who bought a penthouse on the 39th floor in 2019. The couple paid\n$16 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Southampton is trying to rebalance the Hamptons housing map and it\u2019s starting east of the Shinnecock Canal.\nThe town board this month unanimously approved an affordable housing overlay district designed to push workforce housing into the area\u2019s most expensive enclaves, where sky-high home prices have long priced out the year-round labor force. The move creates a pathway for small- to mid-sized affordable projects in places that have historically been off-limits, Newsday\nreported\n.\nThe overlay allows developments with 10 to 35 affordable units on parcels zoned for business or single-family use, provided they receive subsidies from the town\u2019s Community Housing Fund.\nThe overlay is discretionary, meaning projects must be approved case by case by the town board, but officials say it is meant to speed along proposals that would otherwise be tangled up in zoning or never built at all.\nSeveral hamlets east of the canal rank among the nation\u2019s most expensive housing markets, while roughly half of Southampton\u2019s homes are seasonal, according to a town housing study. Much of the town\u2019s existing affordable stock has been clustered west of the canal, forcing workers to commute east along already clogged corridors like County Road 39.\nTown leaders hope the zoning tweak will shift that pattern. Planning officials cited Sandy Hollow Cove Apartments, a 28-unit complex in Tuckahoe designed to resemble a manor-style residence, as a template for how denser projects can blend into high-end surroundings.\nProjects approved under the overlay must sit on parcels as small as 60,000 square feet \u2014 a sharp reduction from the prior 220,000-square-foot minimum \u2014 though developments along County Road 39 are excluded from overlay consideration.\nThe zoning change dovetails with Southampton\u2019s CHF, a half-percent real estate transfer tax approved by voters in 2022. Since launching in 2023, the fund has generated $39 million, $27.5 million of which has already been spent or committed, according to the town.\nSeveral projects east of the canal \u2014 totaling 58 units across Tuckahoe, Water Mill, Shinnecock Hills and North Sea \u2014 are already lined up for funding but still need overlay approval to proceed.\nNot everyone is sold: some residents warned that higher density could worsen traffic and erode community character, especially near the canal. Town officials counter that most applicants are existing East End residents or workers who were priced out and want to return.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

More than 100 employees are expected to make the move with Empire to its forthcoming Financial District hub.\nThe local record label, distribution and publishing firm led by Ghazi Shami purchased the building from Affinius Capital at the beginning of the year for\n$24.5 million\n. The company plans to invest another $40 million in the property.\nApproval from the Planning Commission almost didn\u2019t arrive due to a debate over privately owned public rooftop space.\nEmpire wanted to close the space as a security precaution, offering three public concerts a year as a carrot. That didn\u2019t sway the commission, which was deadlocked at 3-3 after a first vote.\nBut a majority shifted in favor after Empire tacked on another public concert to its promise. It also removed the ability to opt out of the promise with a fee payment.\n\u201cI believe this project, when finished, will go a long way to not just reactivate but revitalize downtown as we know it,\u201d Commissioner Sean McGarry said after the approval.\nThe storied building has a troubled recent history.\nRedco Development and Boston-based AEW Capital Management bought the 100,000-square-foot office building in 2019 for $84 million.

They gave the keys of the vacant building to lender Square Mile Capital, now known as Affinius Capital.\nEmpire will use office space on the basement and second floor of the building. In addition to the office space, Empire is planning to open a restaurant in one of the banking halls, while the other will mostly be utilized for private use.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "With a little more than a week\nleft in office\n, the Adams administration released recommendations for ramping up housing construction in Manhattan.\nThe mayor\u2019s office on Monday released the\nso-called Manhattan Plan\n, laying out six \u201ckey themes\u201d for increasing housing construction in Manhattan.\nThose themes include building near transit and job centers, upzoning mid-density districts to allow more housing, building on government-owned sites, encouraging development on vacant or underutilized private sites, streamlining approval processes and exploring new models of housing.\nMayor Eric Adams first announced the\nManhattan Plan\nduring his State of the City address in January. At the time, he said the plan would add 100,000 units of housing to Manhattan over the next decade.\nThat number, however, is a target and not a reflection of how many units could be created if future administrations follow the plan\u2019s recommendations. Already-approved initiatives, including the Midtown South rezoning and a portion of the 80,000 units made possible by the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity text amendment\n, are also baked into that unit count. The administration doesn\u2019t have an estimate of how many units could be built for each of the plan\u2019s recommendations.\nThe plan recommends looking at housing opportunities near the Second Avenue subway, noting that the second phase of the project will extend to 125th Street, much of which is within a special district that has height and density limits that restrict development.\n\u201cOver the past decade, despite strong community advocacy, much of the corridor\u2019s development potential remains unrealized,\u201d the report states.\nIt suggests upzoning parts of Community Board 6, which includes Manhattan east of Lexington Avenue from 14th to 59th Streets. The\nboard\nhas pushed the administration to help it craft a housing plan. This could include mapping R11 and R12 districts, which respectively allow buildings that are 15 and 18 times the size of the lot on which they rise.\nThe plan additionally points to special districts, industrial zones and historic districts as opportunities to ease zoning restrictions and allow more housing.\nThe administration also floats rebuilding Manhattan\u2019s bulkheads and hardening the shoreline to allow more waterfront development. More extensive land reclamation to extend the borough\u2019s shoreline would require changes to federal law, however.\nThe plan also calls for further study of how to incentivize development on long-vacant or under-utilized sites. It highlights Soloviev Group\u2019s site on First Avenue between East 38th and East 41st streets, which is Manhattan\u2019s largest vacant site. The developer proposed a\ncasino\nfor the property, which has been vacant since 2007, but the proposal was\nrejected\n. The firm hasn\u2019t announced what it now plans for the site, but executives have indicated that they do not plan to let the property sit vacant.\nThe report further recommends that the city work with the state to reform environmental review and allow more shared housing options, including\nsingle-room occupancy units\n.\nIt is not unusual for planning initiatives to span multiple administrations. To what extent Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani picks the plan\u2019s strategies remains to be seen, but he has said\nthat he supports building more housing in areas that have \u201chistorically not contributed to citywide housing goals.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A fire-scarred commercial property along Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades could soon get a mixed-use reset, as developers begin to test how far Los Angeles\u2019 post-wildfire rebuilding push can go beyond single-family homes.\nKeyes Real Estate filed plans to redevelop 15113 West Sunset Boulevard with a\nthree-story building\nfeaturing six apartments atop roughly 2,500 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to Urbanize Los Angeles. The site has sat vacant since the Palisades wildfire in January, which along with the Eaton fire damaged or destroyed billions of dollars of property damage.\nThe proposal calls for a contemporary low-rise structure designed by\nDesignARC\n, with a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom units stacked above retail space fronting Sunset. Parking would be tucked behind the building using mechanical lifts, a common workaround in space-constrained infill projects.\nTo unlock additional density beyond what zoning would normally allow, Keyes is seeking incentives under the city\u2019s density bonus program. In exchange, one of the six apartments would be reserved for a very low-income household \u2014 a modest affordability component, but one that reflects the city\u2019s push to pair recovery with housing production.\nThe project will require approval from the city planning commission and lands amid heightened scrutiny of post-fire cleanup and redevelopment in the\nPalisades\n. Earlier this month, the city council targeted the last 11 parcels that had not completed debris removal, signaling a tougher stance after repeated notices to property owners.\nAt the same time, Mayor Karen Bass has been rolling out a series of\nemergency orders\naimed at speeding reconstruction. Emergency Executive Order 10, issued in October, streamlined permitting for commercial and business properties damaged in the fire, extended land-use entitlements and allowed licensed architects and engineers to self-certify certain code and site conditions. That followed an earlier July order focused on expediting residential rebuilding.\nBass has also floated financial relief, including calling for exemptions from Measure ULA \u2014 the city\u2019s so-called\nmansion tax\non sales over $5 million \u2014 for Palisades homeowners affected by the fires, a move closely watched by brokers and owners in the luxury-heavy enclave.\nCity data suggests the fast-track approach is having an impact. Rebuilding permits for single-family homes in Pacific Palisades are now being approved nearly three times faster than before the fires. As of Dec. 22, Los Angeles had approved more than 1,670 rebuilding plans and issued 1,354 permits covering 644 addresses, according to the city\u2019s rebuilding dashboard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A buyer signed a contract to purchase a waterfront Coconut Grove estate that was previously asking $135 million, and is now on the market for $115 million.\nThe pending deal marks the most expensive of 19 contracts signed in Miami-Dade County between Dec. 15 and Dec. 21, according to the latest Eklund-Gomes report. It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 104 days on the market, on average.\nForty-five luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,313 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed 20 contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $259.3 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 11 single-family homes and eight condos under contract last week totals $305 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $20.4 million and spent an average of 73 days on the market. They total nearly $224 million in asking dollar volume.\nAt the top is\nBanyan Ridge\n, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way in Miami. It\u2019s listed with Danny Hertzberg, Jill Hertzberg, Nathan and Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker. The seller is the estate of the late prominent Miami restaurateur Jonathan Lewis, and the sale is expected to surpass a recent $100 million-plus lot deal in Coconut Grove by billionaire Jorge Mas. Lewis\u2019 father was Peter B. Lewis, the former chairman and CEO of Progressive Insurance Company.\nThe property includes a 4,100-square-foot, three-bedroom house that was built for former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan; and a 5,300-square-foot, four-bedroom home built for Peter Lewis.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $10.1 million and spent 147 days on the market, on average. They total $81.2 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,525 per square foot.\nAndrew Zaro\u2019s purchase of a lower penthouse at Palazzo Del Sol on Fisher Island topped the condo component of the report. The sale was recorded on the Multiple Listing Service at $36 million, which included furniture, but the deed was recorded for\njust over $35 million\n. The sale marks the priciest condo trade on Fisher Island this year. Zaro is a member of the family behind Zaro\u2019s Bakery in New York.\nThe 9,800-square-foot seven-bedroom unit traded between $3,600 per square foot and nearly $3,800 per square foot. Pierre Brondeau, executive chairman of FMC Corp., a Philadelphia-based agricultural sciences company, and his wife Melissa Brondeau sold the lower penthouse. Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty represented the sellers in their latest deal. Jorge Escasena of Luxury Living Realty \u2014 unrelated to Puig\u2019s firm \u2014 represented the buyer.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 21 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $137.3 million, and the typical home spent 639 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Weeks after closing on Chicago\u2019s priciest multifamily sale in more than two years, a California investor is back in the market \u2014 scooping up another tower a couple of blocks away.\nAn affiliate of San Francisco\u2013based FPA Multifamily paid $89 million for a 263-unit apartment tower at 420 East Ohio Street in Streeterville, according to property records. The deal comes in at roughly $338,400 per unit, and is just two blocks from\nNorth Water Apartments\n, the 398-unit residential portion of the 50-story tower at 340 East North Water Street that FPA bought in November for nearly $175 million, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThat earlier acquisition marked the highest-priced multifamily sale in Chicago since August 2023. Together, the two deals signal a confident bet on Streeterville, a downtown submarket bounded by the Magnificent Mile, Lake Michigan and the Chicago River that has held up better than many other areas through the recent market slowdown, according to CoStar.\nThe Ohio Street tower traded well below its last peak valuation. Portland-based Green Cities, then operating as\nGerding Edlen\n, bought the 41-story building in 2016 for $109 million, during the last cycle\u2019s pricing highs. Like many owners facing higher borrowing costs and a shifting capital markets landscape, Green Cities opted to test the waters as debt maturities loomed, the outlet reported.\nThe property hit the market in June, represented by CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck and Pete Marino. At the time, it was less than 3 percent vacant, and marketing materials pitched an opportunity to upgrade units and amenities \u2014 including the pool deck \u2014 to further push rents.\nDespite price resets on individual buildings, momentum has returned to Chicago\u2019s multifamily investment market. Through most of 2025,\napartment rents\nin the city have outpaced gains in many major U.S. markets, helping coax buyers off the sidelines. Including the Ohio Street deal, investors have poured roughly $4.8 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties this year, already surpassing 2024\u2019s full-year total of $3.9 billion, and marking the strongest volume since $5.9 billion traded in 2022, according to CoStar data.\nFPA has been one of the more active players. Earlier this year, the firm sold a 604-unit complex in\nNaperville\nfor $136 million, the highest-priced suburban multifamily sale of 2025. Last year, it paid $144 million for a 500-unit South Loop tower now branded Arrive Michigan Avenue.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Yet, the city hit another milestone it hasn\u2019t reached in more than a decade.\nYear-over-year office vacancy fell by three points to 33.5 percent as of December, the most significant vacancy decline since 2011, when the country\u2019s economy was crawling out of the Great Recession, according to the same CBRE report.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, the city\u2019s commercial real estate market\nhas risen atop the artificial intelligence tide\n. AI companies leased 2.5 million square feet in 2025, and now fill 7 million square feet of office space in the city, roughly 12 percent of San Francisco\u2019s total occupied space.\nOffice leasing demand\nhas also hit an all-time high, according to CBRE, with tenants in the market seeking about 8 million square feet of office space \u2014 AI companies accounted for 2.8 million square feet of this demand, or 35 percent.\nThe office demand could lead to new development in 2026. Colin Yasukochi, head of CBRE\u2019s tech division, told\nSan Francisco Business Times\nthat as high-quality office supply becomes tighter, tenants in the market may look to partner on new development.\n\u201cSome of these companies may be in the market because they want to consolidate into a new development of some kind,\u201d Yasukochi told the outlet. \u201cBecause right now, many of them are trying to assemble large nearby blocks of space, and for many of them, that isn\u2019t quite as easy as it sounds.\u201d\nOffice development has suffered a dry spell in San Francisco, during which no office towers or downtown developments have broken ground in more than five years.\nHowever, Yasukochi told the Business Times he doesn\u2019t expect AI companies to lead the push for new office development.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be tech or AI, but a lot of the more traditional financial services companies that want to expand and refresh their space,\u201d he said to the outlet. \u201cThey have been the ones that have traditionally gone to these types of developments.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s overall vacancy rate glosses over the waning availability of trophy office space, which\nsits at 15 percent\n, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reported that this could unlock \u201cmajor office projects\u201d planned for Central South of Market by 2027.\n\u2014 Christopher Neely\n",

The sale closed Dec. 12.\nBuilt in 2008, the twin properties have 136 rooms apiece, according to a press release.\nTouchstone Hospitality Fund secured a $20 million loan from Regent Bank for the purchase, according to public records, amounting to about $73,500 per room. The final sale price is undisclosed.\n\u201cWe took this out wide with a public marketing process and ended up getting nine offers on the assets,\u201d said Kami Burnette, senior vice president of Hunter Hotel Advisors, which brokered the sale. \u201cWe ended up selecting a buyer who\u2019s local to the DFW Metroplex, and we felt pretty comfortable with his ability to execute.\u201d\nPlano and Frisco,\nnorthern suburbs of Dallas\n, are business magnets.\nChobani\n,\nToyota\n,\nCohnReznick\n,\nSally Beauty\nare just a few of many companies that have recently put down roots in Collin County.

        "content": "A long-vacant downtown San Antonio hospital tower is inching closer to an apartment makeover, as a key approval gives its developer fresh momentum \u2014 and potential tax savings \u2014 after years of starts and stops.\nThe 23-story Nix building at 414 Navarro Street won a historic tax certification last week from the San Antonio Historic and Design Review Commission, clearing an early hurdle for Houston-based Innjoy Hospitality\u2019s plan to convert the nearly century-old structure into 329 apartments with ground-floor retail. The HDRC approved the measure unanimously through its consent agenda, according to city records and first\nreported\nby the San Antonio Business Journal.\nThe certification positions Innjoy to pursue state and federal historic tax credits through the Texas Historical Commission and the National Park Service. HDRC had already given conceptual approval to the\nproject in August\n, though the development will need a certificate of appropriateness before construction can begin if any changes are proposed to the 94-year-old building.\nThe\nproject\nalso comes with local tax relief. With sign-off from the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, the redeveloped property would avoid ad valorem taxes for five years after renovations are completed. Beginning in year six, the building would be reappraised and taxed at 50 percent of its market value on a rolling five-year basis under the city\u2019s Unified Development Code.\nDetails tied to the historic tax credit application shed new light on the scope and timing. Innjoy plans to carve the ground floor into four retail spaces, while upper floors would be reconfigured into a mix of studios and one-, two- and three-bedroom units. The development team expects to break ground in January and wrap construction in 2028. XA Collective Architecture + Planning, HM3 Engineering and A-1 Engineering are part of the design and engineering team.\nInnjoy bought the 300,000-plus-square-foot tower in 2020, a year after Nix Health shuttered operations in the building. The property sits near the River Walk and has remained mostly empty since the hospital\u2019s closure, making it one of the most visible symbols of downtown\u2019s post-pandemic vacancy problem. Landry\u2019s continues to operate restaurant space at the river level.\nThe developer initially floated a\nhotel\nconversion, but pivoted to\nmultifamily\nas market conditions shifted. A state filing in late 2023 projected a construction start in early 2025, a timeline that slipped as financing and approvals lagged.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Besides last names, what do City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Eric Adams have in common?\nBoth of their tenures began in promising fashion for the real estate industry, only to be tarnished at the end \u2014 albeit in entirely different ways.\nThe speaker\u2019s flameout was nowhere near as dramatic as the mayor\u2019s, and it involved not corruption but screwing the real estate industry \u2014 and housing-starved New Yorkers.\nMore drama lies ahead, assuming the mayor\nvetoes\nthe Community Opportunity to Purchase Act and perhaps the\nConstruction Justice Act\nand affordable housing bill\nIntro 1443-A\nas well. A COPA veto would likely not be overridden.\nAdrienne Adams\u2019 speakership began with a\ngroundbreaking statement\nto the New York Times: \u201cI reject that this will be a Council that says no to housing, given the scale of the crisis we face.\u201d For three years, she kept that promise by pushing through\nspot\n,\nneighborhood\nand\ncitywide\nrezonings.\nThat was big, because the mayor\u2019s indictment and bromance with President Donald Trump had left him without the political capital to do any heavy lifting.\nBut this fall, the speaker tarnished her housing legacy by trying to get voters to reject City Charter revisions that will make it easier to build housing, especially in districts that have allowed very few new units.\nI get that she was defending the Council\u2019s power, but the measures \u2014 which passed \u2014 will advance her own fair-housing goals. And she funded her campaign against them with taxpayer money, which was legally questionable at best.\nThen came last week\u2019s votes. COPA was weakened by amendments, but would still require a new, unwieldy bureaucracy at the city\u2019s already overburdened housing agency to enforce a law that would hamstring multifamily sales.\nAnd to what benefit? Its own sponsor, Council member Sandy Nurse, admitted that COPA would create only a \u201ctiny chance\u201d for buildings to be purchased by capable nonprofits.\nThe Construction Justice Act, for its part, will raise the cost of affordable housing, which already is\nmuch more expensive\nto build than market-rate. That will result in fewer units. So will Intro 1443-A, which mandates even lower rents and tenant incomes in city-funded housing, and another bill requiring such developments to have\nmore bedrooms\n.\nTo review: In a span of three months, the speaker fought City Charter revisions and passed COPA and three bills slashing affordable housing production. Fewer homes, more bureaucracy. That\u2019s a helluva way to go out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Southampton\u2019s\nnew overlay district\nreally lead to more affordable housing, given that projects will still have to endure a public hearing (where locals will yell \u201cnot in my back yard!\u201d) and need individual approval by the town board? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Asked who will be a rising star in 2026, Partnership for New York City\u2019s Kathy Wylde named NYSAFAH\u2019s recently hired\nCarlina Rivera\n, \u201cbecause she is going to bring\nunprecedented political savvy\nto the affordable housing industry.\u201d NYSAFAH, which represents affordable housing providers, is known more for industry expertise than for legislative influence.\nElsewhere\u2026\nHeatherwood, a Long Island builder that was\nbetrayed\nby the Town of Hempstead a year ago on a transit-oriented development, just got some good news from the Hochul administration about another project on the peninsula.\nThe state picked Douglas Patrick\u2019s firm to\nbuild 495 homes\non state-owned land in East Farmingdale. The 13-acre property has been \u201cvacant and blighted\u201d for decades, according to a press release from Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nThat will alleviate some of the pain the developer experienced when Hempstead left Heatherwood at the altar last December.\nThe town had rezoned 11.7 acres for multifamily housing in 2019 and its industrial development agency endorsed Heatherwood\u2019s 309-unit project in 2021.\nBut after the developer paid $27 million for the land and $3 million on soft costs, Hempstead repealed the zoning in response to fanatical NIMBYism from nearby residents. The town was left with a cavity instead of housing next to its Long Island Rail Road station in Lawrence \u2014 and\ntwo lawsuits\nfiled by Heatherwood in state court.\nThe company won its cases in state court (appeals are pending), then\nbrought a federal lawsuit\nthis fall seeking its $30 million back plus $160 million in lost profits.\nHochul has had her own problems with anti-development forces on Long Island, where officials led the \u201clocal control, not Hochul control\u201d campaign that\nstopped her Housing Compact\nin 2023. But East Farmingdale is rezoning to accommodate her project, which will include more than 100 homes affordable to households earning 80 percent of the area median income.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top home sale recorded in New York City was a condo at 67 Vestry Street for\n$15.3 million\n. The 3,000-square-foot pad has four bedrooms and three and a half baths. Corcoran\u2019s Catherine Juracich, Tom Ventura and Lesley Schulhof had the\nlisting\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was for an 88,000-square-foot industrial building at 845 East 136th Street in the Bronx for\n$21.7 million\n.\n\u2014\nMary Diduch",

        "content": "Andreina Monserratte, a self-styled real estate trainer who built a following by pitching herself as a compliance and ethics guru to brokers and agents in Miami-Dade County, allegedly stole nearly $90,000 from a home inspection company that hired her less than two years ago.\nMiami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s deputies last week arrested Monserratte, 42, on felony charges of organized fraud and grand theft tied to an alleged year-long scheme targeting her employer, Miami-based South Florida Inspectors.\nBeginning in January 2024, about a month after she was hired, Monserratte swapped out the company email on its Zelle account and substituted her own email and phone number linked to her personal and business bank accounts, according to an arrest report.\nCustomers who believed they were paying\nKendall\n-based South Florida Inspectors for services instead funneled money into Monserratte\u2019s accounts, allowing her to allegedly siphon more than $89,000 through July, investigators alleged.\nDeputies wrote in the arrest report that she \u201crefused to provide a statement.\u201d Reached by phone, Monserratte told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI am not interested in talking. Please call my attorney,\u201d then hung up without providing a name. No lawyer was listed on her court docket at the time of publication, and she has not yet entered a plea.\nGuru without a license\nMonserratte established her bonafides despite never being licensed as a broker or a sales agent, according to online state licensing records. South Florida Inspectors owner Danny Nieves and other real estate professionals who knew her and spoke to\nTRD\nwere also unaware that Monserrate had previous run-ins with the law.\n\u201cHer standing in the real estate community is impeccable as a result of her teaching people classes on MLS [\nMultiple Listing Service\n] and ethics training,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cNobody really was wise to this other side of her.\u201d\nMiami-Dade criminal court records show she was charged with petty larceny in 2003, and a year later she was charged with grand theft. Both times Monserratte completed a pre-trial intervention program, allowing her to avoid a conviction.\nIn 2006, she was arrested a third time for grand theft, receiving probation that she finished in 2011, when the court withheld adjudication \u2014 a disposition that spares defendants a formal conviction under Florida law if they successfully complete supervision. Details of Monserratte\u2019s previous arrests were not available online, as the files have been destroyed.\nStill, the earlier criminal cases did not prevent her from carving out a niche in Miami\u2019s real estate ecosystem as an informal trainer and consultant. On her professional website, Monserratte leaned heavily on themes of ethics, compliance and risk mitigation. She casts herself as a behind-the-scenes architect of some of Miami\u2019s largest brokerages.\n\u201cWe have partnered up with some of the leading industry event companies, to have you mingle with other industry professionals,\u201d Monserratte\u2019s website states. \u201cIn all aspects of life sometimes who you know will take you to the next step of where you should be.\u201d\nShe promotes intensive MLS coaching that goes beyond navigation, promising to make brokers and agents \u201cfully proficient\u201d on creating market reports, hot sheets and other data-driven practices to scale their business.\nHer website biography claims Monserratte has \u201cassisted in the recruiting, retention and training of over 500 real estate agents and brokers for some of the biggest brokerages in Miami.\u201d\nThe alleged embezzlement\nSouth Florida Inspectors owner Nieves said he first crossed paths with Monserratte soon after launching his firm in 2019, when he was struggling to gain traction and was introduced to her through a broker contact. One associate, Nieves recalled, told him that Monserratte had helped grow her brokerage from 200 to 900 agents, fueling a reputation as a \u201cvery praised\u201d and \u201cvery respected\u201d operator in the real estate industry.\nAt the time, Monserratte provided him with free advice, as well as opened doors and made introductions that \u201creally helped us take off the company,\u201d Nieves said. In 2023, after learning that Monserratte had left a full-time job as a sales manager with Broker\u2019s, a\nFort Lauderdale\n-based brokerage, he brought her on board as his company\u2019s office manager.\n\u201cI actually pursued her and offered her a job,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cSince she had helped me grow my company for free, I could only imagine how much more she could do if I hired her.\u201d\nShortly after, Nieves\u2019 father was diagnosed with stage four cancer, forcing him to step back from daily operations to shuttle him to chemotherapy and care for him.\n\u201cFor a period of almost over a year, I was taking care of my father until his suicide [earlier this year],\u201d Nieves said. \u201cSo she took advantage of it. She kind of exploited a situation when I was at my absolute low.\u201d\nHe slowly returned to the office after his father\u2019s death and realized \u201cthings just weren\u2019t adding up,\u201d Nieves said.\nHe discovered financial irregularities in his company\u2019s account in July. Internal checks revealed \u201ca very sophisticated scheme\u201d in which Monserratte allegedly \u201cwas able to manipulate and change the Zelle payments \u2026 to her personal bank account, and then embezzle money through it,\u201d he said.\nPrevious employer speaks out\nClaudia Serna\n, owner of Broker\u2019s, told\nTRD\nthat she would have warned Nieves to stay away from Monseratte, who worked for Broker\u2019s from 2021 until late 2022.\nInitially Monserratte excelled at the job, especially at agent support and recruitment, Serna said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got it going on,\u201d Serna said, describing Monserratte. \u201cShe\u2019s bilingual, responsive to agents late at night and well-liked. She\u2019s got WhatsApp and Telegram chats packed with brokers and sales associates.\u201d\nBut within months, Serna said, irregularities surfaced in a referral incentive program that used $100 Amazon gift cards emailed as thank-yous to agents who sent recruits to Broker\u2019s. Each card had a digital code that could be tracked to the Amazon account that redeemed it.\nAccording to Serna, Monserratte was copied on the gift card emails in her role overseeing recruitment. After an agent complained that a promised card showed up as already redeemed, Serna dug into her brokerage\u2019s Amazon\u2019s logs and allegedly found that \u201cmany, many of the cards were cash[ed] on on Andreina\u2019s [Amazon] account.\u201d\nWhen confronted, Serna said, Monserratte blamed her daughter.\n\u201cShe said her daughter was the one that cashed them,\u201d Serna recalled.\nBut that explanation did not add up, given the multiple email and push notifications Amazon sends when gift credits are used, Serna said.\n\u201cIf your daughter was doing this, the Amazon account is yours, you receive the notifications,\u201d Serna said. \u201cYou must have known.\u201d\nSerna said she fired Monserratte but declined to press charges.\n\u201cHer daughters were like 12 and 13 or something like that,\u201d Serna said. \u201cAnd she was a single mom. I felt sorry.\u201d\nWithin months of the Amazon incident, Serna said she saw Monserratte resurface \u2014 this time aligned with \u201cone of the big girls in the real estate industry\u201d who had launched a new brokerage.\n\u201cWhen I saw that on Instagram, I called my colleague and I told her, \u2018Listen, this happened in my office. Be careful with that girl. I really don\u2019t know what she is into, just watch out,\u2019\u201d Serna said. The colleague brushed off the warning, Serna said.\nAfter news of Monserratte\u2019s most recent arrest, Serna said her phone and industry group chats have been lighting up.\n\u201cDuring this weekend, it was being discussed like 22 times on different chats with people in the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s very well known in the real estate broker community.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A sprawling mansion in an elite Silicon Valley enclave has hit the market for the first time.\nVilla de Verano, a Lake Como-inspired estate sitting on more than 12 acres in Hillsborough was custom-built in 2013 for private equity investor Ted Kruttschnitt and his wife, Alexia, who still own the property according to public records. The only owners of Villa de Verano are asking for $88 million,\naccording to SFGATE\n. If sold at asking, the estate would set a new highwater mark for Hillsborough, where the median home sales price in November was about $3.7 million, per Redfin.\nVilla de Verano, at 3000 Ralston Avenue, in Hillsborough, is in-part the brainchild of well-known architect and interior designer duo Andrew Skurman of Skurman Architects and Suzanne Tucker of Tucker &amp; Marks Design. Jennifer Gilson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is the listing agent. When it was completed in 2013, the property received the California Landscape Contractors Association\u2019s annual Grand Sweepstakes Award for best residential estate in California, per SFGATE.\nAcross the main and guest house, the property includes six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, a 2,100-gallon saltwater aquarium, theater, a gym, and koi and reflection ponds, as well as a swimming pool, redwood grove and tennis court.\nIt\u2019s often said that confidence on the higher end of the market can affect the movement of mid and lower-tier properties as well. If Villa de Verona fetches its asking price, it would supersede the most expensive Bay Area home sale of 2025 \u2014 Woodside\u2019s Green Gables Estate, which\nwent for $85 million earlier this fall.\nHowever, the final sale was considerably under the\noriginal asking price of $135 million.\nThe previous record for Hillsborough is a home formerly owned by Elon Musk. The Tesla co-founder sold the French chateau-styled estate for $30 million in 2021. The owners then turned around and sold it the following year for $35 million,\naccording to Mansion Global.\nHillsborough made headlines earlier this year when 20th century crooner Bing Crosby\u2019s former home\ntraded hands for $25 million\n. The singer\u2019s family, which owned the 11-bedroom home for six decades, originally sought $40 million for the property.\n\u2014\nChristopher Neely\n",

        "content": "A long dormant stretch of land in Argyle is finally headed for development, as a California landowner moves forward with a $160 million mixed-use project designed to capture the rapid growth pushing north of Fort Worth.\nR.Y. Properties, led by Robert Yu, plans to develop 123 acres at the southwest corner of Robson Ranch Road and I-35 West with retail and a potential medical and wellness campus, according to an announcement from the town. The project advanced after\nArgyle\nofficials signed off on an economic development agreement following months of rezoning discussions, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nUnder the deal, R.Y. Properties will invest $25 million in site infrastructure, including roads, water, wastewater and drainage. In return, the developer will be eligible for a performance-based reimbursement of sales taxes capped at $20 million \u2014 a structure increasingly common for fast-growing North Texas suburbs eager to broaden their tax base without front-loading incentives, according to the outlet.\nThe tenant lineup is still coming together, but health care could anchor the project. Jim Wills, who manages the land for R.Y. Properties, told the outlet that there is a \u201cvery good possibility\u201d that Baylor Scott &amp; White Health will locate a campus on the site, a concept floated during earlier town meetings. Retail negotiations are also ongoing with a mix of local and national players.\nThe project won\u2019t include an\nH-E-B\n, though not for lack of trying. Wills said discussions with the grocer fell through after H-E-B opted for a site across the street in\nHillwood\u2019s\n$10 billion Landmark development, though he added that losing the grocery store opens the door to a broader range of retailers.\nTiming is key. Argyle and nearby communities are absorbing thousands of new homes, including Hillwood\u2019s 4,000-home Harvest community. Within a 10-minute drive of the site live more than 61,000 residents with an average home value north of $730,000 and a median household income above $150,000, according to a Retail Strategies report cited by the town. The site also sits near Hillwood\u2019s Alliance development, which has generated tens of thousands of jobs.\nInfrastructure has been the missing link. Wills said the land lacked access to sanitary sewer for years, a hurdle recently cleared through coordination with Texas Department of Transportation and the\nTarrant Regional Water District\n.\nWhile the full R.Y. Properties land spans about 195 acres, only 123 acres were rezoned in this phase. Town Manager Mike Sims called it a phasing issue and said additional development is likely down the road.\nArgyle estimates the project could generate roughly $127 million in sales tax revenue, supporting a broader push to rely less on property taxes \u2014 and cementing the town\u2019s bid to evolve from bedroom community to regional destination.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But James must not be reading my column, because I explained the\nutter failure\nof Unlocking Doors on Sept. 8.\nThe headline: \u201cZero sum game: City program has awarded landlords no grants.\u201d\nThe subhead: \u201cIn 20 months, \u2018Unlocking Doors\u2019 has yet to open any.\u201d\nWhy on earth would Mamdani upsize a program that is clearly not working?\nUnlocking Doors is a classic example of government ostensibly trying to solve one problem, then designing a program that tries to solve others and ends up solving none.\nThe objective was to provide rent-stabilized landlords money to renovate vacant units that were rendered unfixable in 2019 by the state\u2019s Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act.\nBut the Adams administration added another goal: helping voucher holders. Making Unlocking Doors exclusive to them scared away countless owners.\n\u201cSection 8 = tenants for life and we\u2019re not talking the cream of the crop,\u201d one reader\ncommented\non a Gothamist story.\nThe city also limited the program to low-rent units (no more than $1,200 for a one-bedroom or $1,400 for a three-bedroom) that had been vacant for two years.\nIt required landlords to first pay for the renovation, which many lack the funds to do, then pray to be reimbursed. That scared away more of them.\nIf any were still interested, they gave up after seeing that the city would pay no more than $25,000, which is about enough to pull building permits, or maybe to update one bathroom.\nThe city later upped the amount to $50,000 \u2014 still not enough for many apartments \u2014 and didn\u2019t alter the other terms that made Unlocking Doors so unloved.\nBy \u201cupsize,\u201d I assume Patchett meant Mamdani should increase the program\u2019s funding and maximum number of units (initially $10 million for 400 apartments). But what the program really needs are fundamental changes.\nMy suggestions:\nOffer the money upfront, rather than as reimbursement. Landlords and their contractors don\u2019t trust the city to pay them back in a timely manner, if at all.\nGet rid of the $50,000 limit. Instead, approve applications based on merit. An $80,000 rehab of a deteriorated two-bedroom may be perfectly justified.\nAllow non-voucher holders to rent the units. Voucher holders would still get some of them, and those who don\u2019t would still be helped as the new supply absorbed other apartment seekers.\nOne pitfall of the two-year vacancy requirement is that owners might warehouse units until they qualify for the program. But if the program were attractive enough, its funding would be used up before anyone unnecessarily holding units empty could apply.\nMamdani will likely try to create viable programs to get vacant, rent-stabilized units back on the market because he opposes rent increases, which are the only other way to pay for renovations.\nBut scaling up a program that has zero participants would serve no purpose. Unlocking Doors needs an overhaul.\nMaybe Patchett meant beef up, not scale up. Maybe an editor changed his copy. Whatever the case, James, thanks for the column idea. Next lunch is on me.\n",

        "content": "This list of top 10 office sales in Los Angeles County is based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of data via Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Colliers through late-September, along with consideration of prior reporting. It includes six trades that came outside the reach of Measure ULA, the property transfer tax that applies only within the City of Los Angeles\u2013though that probably had less to do with the tax, and more about pricing and location.\nThis list covers the top 10 office trades by total price, but ranks them by price per square foot. There were other, pricier deals on a square footage basis over the same period, but they are not included because their total prices didn\u2019t meet the mark.\nWhile there is still time for potential record-breakers, these are the deals that make the top 10 for 2025 to this point:\n1601 Vine Street\nKingsbarn Realty Capital\npurchased\nan eight-story building located in Hollywood and occupied by Kim Kardashian\u2019s Skims for $105 million. It came after a lawsuit against the lender that derailed an earlier deal. JH Snyder was the seller of the property at 1601 Vine Street, along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The deal worked out to $908 per square foot, the priciest on a square foot basis on the ranking.\nMaple Plaza\nPublicly traded real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\npurchased\nthe office campus in Beverly Hills from Tishman Speyer for $205.3 million, or $701 per square foot.\nTRD\nfirst reported Tishman was selling, but the buyer was a\nmystery\n.\nOnce the buyer was revealed, we learned it was a competitive process, and more information on Maple Plaza came during an Kilroy\nearnings call\n, where Chief Executive Angela Aman said\u00a0 the property had \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio.\u201d\nMurdock Plaza\nReal estate investment trust Douglas Emmett\npurchased\nMurdock Plaza at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The 17-story office tower at the corner of Westwood and Wilshire boulevards traded hands for $131.1 million, or $539 per square foot. The company later\nannounced\nplans to turn the office tower into apartments.\nIlo at Playa Vista\nSilicon Beach may not be what it used to be, but trades there are still pricier than downtown. Clarion Partners\nsold\na creative office campus at 12130 to 12180 Millenium Drive to institutional investor Barings for $150.7 million, or $512 per square foot. The Playa Vista mixed-use complex was 90 percent occupied but faced near-term lease expirations. Clarion purchased the property more than a decade earlier for $133 million.\nEntrada\nFenway Capital Advisors\npurchased\nan 11-story office building in Culver City for $130 million. The seller was Lincoln Property Company and Goldman Sachs affiliate Broad Street Principal Investments, and the deal came out to $413 per square foot. But the $130 million doesn\u2019t cover the $142.5 million debt the sellers took on to develop the property at 6181 Centinela Avenue that was 75 percent occupied. It is more than the $33 million the joint venture partners paid for the real estate back in 2018 when it was a stalled development site.\nThe Park Calabasas\nCross Ocean Partners and Palisade Group purchased a three-story office building in Calabasas, an affluent area, where San Fernando Valley meets the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains, for $69.4 million, or $312 per square foot, from the U.S. arm of China-based investment company Gemdale. It sold for less than its prior $79 million purchase price four years ago but was completely leased.\nPasadena Towers\nPasadena has seen its fair share of office distress, and the sale of Pasadena Towers, not to be confused with the Pasadena Office Tower, was no different. The two-building complex\ntraded\nfor $125 million, or $262 per square foot. The two properties, at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard, connected by a courtyard, had a prior price of $256 million. Harbor Associates and Roxborough Group were the buyers, the seller was CBRE Investment Management. It was the largest ever investment by Harbor Associates.\nFigueroa at Wilshire\nBrookfield is synonymous with downtown Los Angeles office distress. The giant\ndumped\na 52-story tower at 601 South Figueroa Street, and it happened to be the priciest trade all year but was still less than the debt connected to the property. Uncommon Developers purchased the skyscraper for $210 million in an off-market trade that amounted to $201 a square foot. The debt balance was $250 million, though we learned there was no impairment on it. The pricing was distressed, but an office trade above $150 per square foot is still something nowadays.\nColliers\u2019 Mark Schuessler represented Uncommon Developers; Newmark\u2019s Kevin Shannon represented Brookfield, which may not have another trade on our ranking but does have\ndistressed offerings\nconnected to properties it either owns or lost control to receivers. In September, there was a conference at Uncommon Developers\u2019 601 South Figueroa Street, on the twenty-third floor overlooking the rest of the financial district \u2014 it was gutted then.\n400 to 600 Corporate Pointe\nNew York Life Insurance\nsold\na Culver City office campus for $72.5 million. Sunny Hills Capital Management Company purchased the buildings at 400 and 600 Corporate Pointe in a deal that came out to $159 per square foot. The property recently underwent a renovation to the tune of $18.7 million.\n101 North Brand Boulevard\nIzek Shomof\npurchased\na 19-story office building in Glendale for $58.8 million from Beacon Capital Partners, around half the $128.5 million the seller paid in 2016. The latest deal comes out to $143 per square foot. Shomof recently made another\ndiscounted buy\n, a Long Beach office tower for $50 million, or around $100 per square foot, that didn\u2019t make the cut.\n",

        "content": "As companies shift focus to office space in the Dallas suburbs, so do investors. The region\u2019s largest office trade of the year (by more than 100,000 square feet) was in the north Dallas city of Plano.\nBut this year\u2019s list of biggest sales also reflects the supremacy of Uptown, which has cemented its status as the most coveted office submarket with the rise of \u201cY\u2019all Street.\u201d Uptown is becoming the headquarters of Dallas\u2019 answer to Wall Street, with financial companies ranking the walkable district first on their office wishlists.\nHere\u2019s the list of Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s largest office sales of the year, with data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Avison Young, Colliers, CBRE and Newmark.\nLegacy West | 5905 Legacy Drive | 575,033 square feet\nIndianapolis-based real estate investment trust Kite Realty teamed up with global investor GIC to plant a flag in Plano. The pair snagged Plano\u2019s crown jewel,\nLegacy West\n, for a whopping $785 million in April. The property, at 5908 Headquarters Drive, is billed as a high-end retail center, but it\u2019s also got 575,000 square feet of\nprime suburban Dallas office space\n\u2014 which has been the saving grace of the sluggish Dallas office market in 2025. The seller was a joint venture of The Karahan Companies and Invesco.\nTexas Capital Center | 2000 McKinney Street | 456,000 square feet\nAn Uptown trade ranked second. Crescent Real Estate picked up the\n21-story Texas Capital Center\n, at 2000 McKinney Avenue, in what was the city\u2019s largest office deal in years. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price in September, but\u00a0 \u201ca significant value increase,\u201d it said in a release. The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016. It is anchored by Texas Capital Bank, which occupies 44 percent of the property. The bank has 15 more years on its lease. CoStar reported the building was 82.7 percent occupied in May. The property is adjacent to Klyde Warren Park.\nGalleria North Tower | 13737 Noel Road | 379,518 square feet\nBack to the \u2018burbs: Boston-based WS Development\nnabbed Galleria North Tower\n, a 380,000-square-foot office tower in the Dallas North Tollway corridor for an undisclosed price in April. The seller was a fund owned by the Iowa Public Employees Retirement System. The property last changed hands in 2014 for $86 million, according to an SEC filing. The 16-story building, at 13737 Noel Road, was built in 1998 and is about 65 percent occupied\nSterling Plaza | 5949 Sherry Lane | 320,000 square feet\nCalifornians aren\u2019t just buying up homes in Texas. San Francisco\u2013based Shorenstein Investment Advisers\nacquired Sterling Plaza\n, a 19-story, 313,600-square-foot office building in Dallas\u2019 Preston Center submarket. The building at 5949 Sherry Lane is 87 percent leased and underwent renovations in 2023. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the July acquisition marks Shorenstein\u2019s second major Dallas office investment in under a year, following its 2024 purchase of International Plaza II.\nThe Link | 2601 Olive Street | 292,000 square feet\nAtlanta-based Cousins Properties wrapped up the Texas summer with a bang. The REIT\nbought The Link at Uptown\nin Dallas in July for $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot, as part of a $1 billion buying spree. The seller was Dallas-based Kaizen Development Partners, which completed the 25-story tower, at 2601 Olive Street, in 2021. It\u2019s about 94 percent leased.\nThe Crossings | 5429 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway | 233,000 square feet\nSkywalker Property Partners has\nre-entered the office market\nwith its first acquisition in seven years. The Dallas-based firm bought The Crossings, a 233,000-square-foot office building at 5429 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway for an undisclosed price. The 10-story building near Galleria Dallas was 94 percent leased at the time of sale in May. The seller was Goddard Investment Group. The asset will be folded into Skywalker\u2019s recently launched investment fund, the Leverage Strikes Back LLC.\n4331 Communications Drive | 206,040 square feet\nDallas-based Forefront Commercial Real Estate snapped up 4331 at Pinnacle Park, an Oak Cliff office at 4331 Communications Drive in January. The property\nended up in foreclosure\nafter Mexico City-based private equity fund the Aztec Fund appeared to default on a $65 million loan from Bank of American tied to 4331 at Pinnacle Park and five other North Texas assets.\nCommerce Plaza Hillcrest | 12800\u201312890 Hillcrest Road | 204,650 square feet\nOne of the biggest office deals of the year has nothing to do with the office space. In the first quarter, Texas grocery giant H-E-B picked up Commerce Plaza Hillcrest for the land. The 204,650-square-foot office campus, at 2800\u201312890 Hillcrest Road sits on nearly 10 acres. H-E-B is gearing up to build its first Dallas store on the property after winning a contentious zoning fight against residents who said the store would be \u201cout of character\u201d with the neighborhood. Plus, H-E-B did the seller a solid by taking the property off its hands: Silver Star Properties is three years into a sell-off of its commercial holdings as it tries to execute a pivot to self-storage. The purchase price was not disclosed.\nIntellicenter | 3701 Regent Boulevard | 200,079 square feet\nDoug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial Investments bought Intellicenter in February for an undisclosed price, and plans to give it a new life. The 200,000-square-foot Irving office property at 3701 Regent Boulevard was also part of the Aztec Fund-owned portfolio that\nlanded in foreclosure\nin 2024. Intellicenter was built in 2007.\nPreston Sherry Plaza | 8201 Preston Road | 165,000 square feet\nAustin-based Endeavor\nplanted a flag in Dallas\nwith its purchase of Preston Sherry Plaza in July. The 165,000-square-foot mixed-use development features two floors of retail and five floors of offices. It was built in 1986 and was 93 percent leased at the time of the trade. Endeavor\u2019s ownership is clearly shaking things up, as Sevy\u2019s Grill, a longtime Preston Hollow power lunch haunt anchoring the ground floor, announced plans to close in the summer of 2026.\n",

        "content": "David Schwartz\u2019s Slate Property Group closed on its acquisition of the Stewart Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, readying a massive hotel-to-residential conversion.\nSlate and its nonprofit partner Breaking Ground acquired the property at 371 Seventh Avenue for $255 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Over the summer,\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nthat the partners were nearing a deal to grab the property from Jack Yadidi\u2019s Sioni Group and Isaac Chetrit\u2019s Patriarch Equities for around $275 million.\nYadidi and Chetrit had envisioned a conversion of the property. Yadidi filed\nplans\nwith the city last year to convert the property into a 625-unit residential project. It was a 618-key hotel, but it closed in 2022 and was temporarily used as a migrant shelter.\nSlate and Breaking Ground are pursuing a similar project, though with a slightly lower unit count.\nThe incoming ownership group will convert the property into 579 affordable housing units, including apartments for formerly homeless individuals. Monthly rents are expected to start between $1,385 to $1,731.\nThe redevelopment will also include office space for social services overseen by Breaking Ground. The conversion is expected to take two years, a shorter timeline than comparable projects due to the property\u2019s existing residential-favorable layout.\nThe all-in cost of the redevelopment, including the building acquisition, will reach roughly $500 million. The state\u2019s Hotel and Commercial Conversions Program is providing $87 million in financing.\n\u201cThis project combines extraordinary scale, rapid construction and long-term stewardship by a respected non-profit,\u201d Schwartz said.\nPatriarch, Sioni and Highgate acquired the then-four-star hotel across from Madison Square Garden in 2016 for\n$217.5 million\n, securing a $158.8 million loan from Blackstone. Early last year, Chetrit acquired Highgate\u2019s stake in the hotel, clearing the way for the conversion.\nSlate is one of the city\u2019s most prolific affordable housing developers. A few months ago, the city\npicked\nSlate, Xenolith Partners and nonprofit Comunilife to build more than 600 affordable housing units in northern Manhattan. The team will develop 4095 Ninth Avenue, a long-vacant, city-owned site along the Harlem River in Inwood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The site at 245 Duffield Street is home to a vacant two-story building, formerly a Planet Fitness gym.\nThe permits submitted to the Department of Buildings call for a 100,000-square-foot project with 4,600 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Residential amenities will include a golf simulator, swimming pool, sauna and fitness center.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the units will be rentals or condos, though previously filed paperwork hints at the latter.

        "content": "Google is joining Apple and Nvidia in buying buildings it leases in Silicon Valley.\nMountain View-based Google bought a 22,000-square-foot building at 1808 Shoreline Boulevard for $32.8 million, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was Morris Associates XI, a subsidiary of local developer Jeffrey A. Morris Group.\nIn 2023, Jeffrey A. Morris Group started the process of revamping the office to create a bigger corporate complex, which included upping the Shoreline Boulevard building\u2019s size from one story to six, adding more than 80,000 square feet of offices to the property. The city of Mountain View approved Jeffrey A. Morris Group\u2019s plan, though the firm never followed through with redeveloping the building.\nThe purchase comes the same week the tech giant offloaded another property in Sunnyvale. Planetary Ventures, a joint venture between Google and the California Air National Guard sold the building at 494 South Bernardo Avenue to 494 Bernardo LP, a subsidiary of Palo Alto-based The Mozart Development Company.\nThe building is located in a neighborhood where Google once committed to building 7,000 residential units and 360 commercial-use condominiums as part of its\nNorth Bayshore development plan\n; it was approved for those plans in 2023, but backed away from them as part of its wider retreat from real estate development. In May, Google sought to sell 40 acres in Mountain View where it previously planned to build 1,900 homes, 380 affordable housing units, 50,000 square feet of retail space and 1.3 million square feet of offices in a mixed-use development known as\nMiddlefield Park\n.\nGoogle\u2019s building purchase follows similar moves by Nvidia and Apple this year to buy buildings they lease for offices.\nIn September, Nvidia added to its office holdings with the\npurchase of 2701 San Tomas Expressway\nin Santa Clara from Sobrato for $83.2 million, part of a four-building complex. In May, Nvidia purchased three other buildings in the Santa Clara office complex from Sobrato in May for $254 million.\nOver the summer, Apple bought a three-building, 220,700-square-foot property at 10200 North Tantau Avenue in Cupertino, for\nmore than $166.9 million\nin an all-cash deal from PGIM, followed by the acquisition of Kilroy Realty\u2019s four-building\nMathilda Campus\nin Sunnyvale for $365 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s chain store count keeps sliding, even as storefront vacancies remain tight and food brands keep expanding.\nThe number of national retailers across the five boroughs fell 1.3 percent over the past year, a net loss of 112 locations, marking the sixth decline in eight years, according to the Center for an Urban Future\u2019s 2025 \u201cState of the Chains\u201d\nreport\n.\nThe pullback was driven by the city\u2019s biggest and most entrenched players. Seven of the 10 largest chains shrank their footprints, losing a combined 92 stores. Starbucks led the retreat, closing 42 locations since late last year, while longtime fixtures like Old Navy, Staples, Banana Republic, Duane Reade and GNC also posted notable declines, CUF found.\nEighteen retailers shut down all of their New York City locations this year, the highest total outside of the pandemic-era wave of closures in 2020, including Rite Aid, Party City, Rent-A-Center and Forever 21.\nThe contraction continues a longer reset. Nearly one in five chains tracked in CUF\u2019s 2019 report have since exited the city entirely. Of the 17 largest retailers operating six years ago, all but two have fewer stores today, a combined loss of more than 1,000 locations.\nCell phone stores, pharmacies and apparel chains have been hit hardest, reflecting the sustained drag of e-commerce and shifting consumer habits on traditional retail categories.\nStill, the data shows plenty of churn rather than a broad collapse: while 133 chains reduced their footprint over the past year, 114 added locations and 258 held steady. Dunkin\u2019 once again ranked as the city\u2019s largest chain and overtook Starbucks as Manhattan\u2019s top retailer, cementing its dominance across all five boroughs; Starbucks came in second, while Metro by T-Mobile ranked third.\nGrowth came overwhelmingly from food and beverage operators, which now account for a record 55.8 percent of all chain locations citywide. Fast-casual restaurants, bakeries, pizza chains and ice cream shops all posted gains, led by brands like Naya, Van Leeuwen, Maman, Wonder and 7th Street Burger expanding aggressively.\nFitness concepts also grew, led by Club Pilates, SLT and StretchLab.\nGeographically, every borough saw a net decline, but Queens stood out for resilience, losing only two stores and hosting six of the seven ZIP codes with the biggest gains.\nFor landlords and brokers, the takeaway is familiar: legacy chains are still retrenching, but demand hasn\u2019t disappeared; it\u2019s being reshuffled toward food and fitness\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group teamed up to pay a record $520 million for Aimco\u2019s waterfront Brickell assemblage, with plans for a luxury hotel and residential project,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nOak Row, led by Erik Rutter and David Weitz, and OKO bought the 4.24-acre property consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Mariposa Real Estate partnered on the purchase.\nThe deal, which closed Tuesday, breaks down to $122.4 million per acre. It is the most expensive sale of a development site in South Florida.\nOak Row put the property\nunder contract\nfor $520 million a year ago, at the time announcing only Mariposa as its co-buyer. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later. Throughout this year, Oak Row made the required periodic deposits, Aimco\u2019s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.\nTyko Capital, a joint venture between debt broker Adi Chugh and billionaire hedge funder Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management, provided $464.5 million senior loan for the purchase and predevelopment.\nThe developers plan to build a hotel and branded condos in the project\u2019s first phase, according to the release. It will join a crowded pipeline of branded residences in South Florida.\nThe tri-county region is the\nepicenter\nfor branded residential projects in North America, according to Knight Frank. As of last month, Miami had\n48 completed\nand 55 planned branded projects, second only to Dubai, according to Savills.\nBranded\nSouth Florida projects on tap include Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Karmely\u2019s KAR Properties\nFaena Residences\non the Miami River, in partnership with Alan Faena; and Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group\nHQ Residences Miami\nin Edgewater, in partnership with Sam Nazarian\u2019s HQ Hotels &amp; Residences by sbe. Marc Anthony is one of Nazarian\u2019s partners.\nOther projects are the\nRitz-Carlton\nin North Bay Village, a\nWaldorf Astoria\nunder construction in downtown Miami and a\nNobu\nin Brickell.\nThe Brickell property, which has 485 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage, can be developed by right with multiple supertalls totalling over 3 million square feet across property types. The tallest height allowed in Miami is 1,049 feet due to Federal Aviation Administration rules.\nDenver-based Aimco, which last month announced a\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slower multifamily market, first listed the sites last year, with an asking price of about\n$650 million\n. The announcement of its dissolution came as Aimco, led by Wes Powell, was selling off properties nationwide.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard led the CBRE team that marketed the Brickell sites.\nOak Row, which has offices in Miami and New York, is on a Miami development spree focused on luxury rentals. Its two Edgewater towers are the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne with 187,000 square feet of commercial space, financed with a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan secured in March; and the 38-story, 324-unit 2900 Terrace tower, financed with a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan secured in June.\nOak Row and its partners this year completed the\nWynwood Plaza\nmixed-use project with a 509-unit apartment building and a 266,000-square-foot office building in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Across from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami, the firm also plans the First &amp; Fifth apartment tower, approved for\n526 units\n.\nOKO and London-based Cain International completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami last year, scoring a pre-leasing bonanza during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. Elsewhere, their projects include the 135-unit Una Residences condo tower in Brickell, and the 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater. Doronin and Len Blavatnik started construction in August of\nAman Miami Beach\nwith hotel rooms and condos.\nLittle has been revealed in marketing materials about Mariposa. It appears tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, who founded firms in the frozen food, chemicals and consumer goods industries. In 2022, Franklin bought a\nbig minority stake\nin the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThe Brickell site sale surpassed the biggest development site deal in South Florida to date. In 2022, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin paid\n$363 million\nfor a 2.5-acre bayfront Brickell lot where he plans a Citadel and Citadel Securities headquarters office tower and other uses. That deal equated to $145.2 million per acre, more than what Oak Row and OKO paid on a per acre basis.\nOak Row and OKO\u2019s total purchase price likely was more than what Griffin had paid because the Aimco assemblage includes income-producing office and apartment buildings.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s biggest hotel trades of 2025 were led by three nine-figure deals for waterfront and resort properties, as investors bet on continued strength in luxury leisure and Miami\u2019s urban hospitality market despite rising financing costs. The 10 largest sales totaled more than $960 million, with buyers ranging from institutional firms, global hotel investors, local developers and mission-driven nonprofits.\u200b The combined sales volume dipped significantly compared to last year when the\ntop 10 hotel deals of 2024\ncombined for $1.5 billion.\n1. $205M | Silver Sands Beach Resort | Key Biscayne\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Miami-based Fortune International Group splashed into Key Biscayne with the most expensive hotel purchase this year.\u00a0 The joint venture paid $205 million for the oceanfront Silver Sands Beach Resort at 301 Ocean Drive. The deal, which closed in April, also set a record price for a Key Biscayne development site sale. The developers plan on redeveloping the 50-room hotel into a 14-story boutique condominium with 56 units. An affiliate of Coral Gables-based Axis Development Corporation sold the 3.9-acre property. The price amounted to $52.6 million per acre.\n2. $204M | The Raleigh | Miami Beach\nThis year\u2019s second-biggest hotel sale was a major blow to developer Michael Shvo. In October, he was forced to sell the historic Art Deco hotel, on 3 acres at 1775 Collins Avenue, after he was unable to match a winning $204.1 million bid by private equity firm Nahla Capital, led by Genghis Hadi. Shvo had gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower alongside the hotel on the beachfront site. But the project languished. The price amounted to $68 million per acre.\n3. $171M | PGA National Resort | Palm Beach Gardens\nThis transaction was part of a larger $400 million-plus deal in January involving an 807-acre property in Palm Beach Gardens. Henderson Park, Salamander Collection and South Street Partners paid $171.4 million for PGA National Resort at 400 Avenue of the Champions. Toronto-based Brookfield sold the 360-key resort and its golf and spa facilities. The courses were designed by golfing legends Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Fazio, Andy Staples and Karl Litten. The price amounted to $475,000 per key.\n4. $148M | East Miami | Brickell\nBlackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, bought the EAST Miami hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza for $147.8 million in September. Trinity Investments and Certares sold the 40-story building for $26 million below the previous sale price in 2021. The 352-key hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza anchors the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex originally developed by Swire. The price amounted to $420,000 per key.\n5. $99M | Moxy Miami | Wynwood\nIstanbul-based S\u00fczer Group, led by Sami \u00c7ak\u0131r and Vice Chairman Baran S\u00fczer, dropped $99 million for a majority stake in the MOXY Miami Wynwood in January. Seller DolphinBay Hospitality, a joint venture between Dolphin Capital Partners and Baywood Hotels, kept a 48 stake in the eight-story, 120-key building at 255 Northwest 25th Street. DolphinBay completed the Kobi Karp-designed hotel in 2024, five years after acquiring the 0.4-acre development site for $11 million.\n6. $44M | KImpton Angler\u2019s | Miami Beach\nFrench hotelier Philippe Le Guennec returned to Miami Beach with a big transaction this year. An entity managed by Le Guennec bought\u00a0 Kimpton Angler\u2019s Hotel in Miami Beach for $43.5 million this month. San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners sold the 132-key building on a 1-acre site at 600 Washington Avenue. The trade breaks down to about $330,000 per room. Le Guennec, who owns 10 hotels in Paris, sold a 24-key Art Deco hotel in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood for $9 million in 2017.\n7. $37M | Plunge Beach Resort | Lauderdale-by-the-Sea\nIn July, T2 Hospitality, led by Mike Patel, acquired Plunge Beach Resort for $36.6 million. An entity managed by Oleksandr Naumyk and Liubov Tereshko sold the 163-room beachfront property consisting of a pair of two-story buildings and a five-story low-rise at 4660 North Ocean Drive. Newport Beach, California-based T2 Hospitality paid roughly $224,500 per key.\n8. $31M | Fairwind Hotel Miami | Miami Beach\nAn Art Deco property in South Beach sold at a discount in November. A joint venture between Tony Di Piazza and Private Exchange Group bought the Fairwind Hotel Miami at 1000 Collins Avenue for $31 million, $298,000 per key and 26 percent below the sale price four years ago. In 2021, seller Israel Katz paid $42 million for the 104-room low-rise building completed in 1936.\n9. $24M | Stadium Hotel | Miami Gardens\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit led by Michael Weinstein, purchased Stadium Hotel in Miami Gardens for $24 million in August. The foundation paid all cash for the 217-room building at 21485 Northwest 27th Avenue in a deal that breaks down to $211,000 per key. An entity managed by David and William Ross sold the 3.9-acre site after months of marketing to hospitality, multifamily, assisted living and alternative-use investors. The buyer likely plans to convert the seven-story building into affordable housing for low-income residents living with HIV.\n10. $23M | Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West | Doral\nRatia Real Estate Development bought the Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West at 1212 Northwest 82nd Avenue in Doral for $23 million in October. An affiliate of Miami-based Qua Integral Services Real Estate sold the 112-key condo-hotel for roughly $205,000 per unit.",

The measure was set for a vote at last week\u2019s board meeting and would have pushed the district\u2019s levy to the maximum allowed under state law.\nHarden, a mayoral appointee tapped last year by Brandon Johnson to lead the hybrid, partially elected school board, said Monday the decision had nothing to do with\nCity Hall\npolitics. Instead, he told the outlet that the pullback stemmed from \u201coutstanding questions\u201d among board members about the levy itself.\nStill, the timing was hard to miss. The maneuver landed squarely in the middle of Johnson\u2019s high-stakes\nbudget showdown\nwith the\nCity Council\n, where the mayor has cast himself as a bulwark against rising taxes \u2014 particularly on working-class homeowners.\nWhile $25 million is a rounding error in\nCPS\u2019 budget\n, the stakes stretch beyond this year. Property tax hikes are cumulative, meaning skipping the increase permanently lowers the district\u2019s baseline. If CPS ultimately passes on the extra levy authority, it would mark the first time since 2009 that the district failed to raise taxes to the legal limit, according to the Tribune.\nThe district isn\u2019t exactly flush. CPS closed a $729 million budget gap this summer through layoffs and service cuts and still carries billions in long-term debt. Its financial plan leans heavily on $522 million in tax increment financing revenue, boosted by Johnson\u2019s push to declare a record $1 billion TIF surplus.\nProperty taxes remain CPS\u2019 largest and most reliable revenue source. The August budget already baked in a 2.9 percent levy increase, or $232.5 million, from last year. Any further bump would have landed on homeowners already reeling from a 16.7 percent jump in median property tax bills across Chicago, according to the publication.\nThe board could still revive the proposal at a special meeting before the Dec. 29 deadline to finalize the levy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s once crowded construction skyline is getting another subtraction.\nNorthland Living put a planned 35-story condo tower near the Texas Capitol on ice, the latest sign that the city\u2019s development boom is losing steam as supply piles up and buyers hesitate. Northland delayed the groundbreaking and sales launch for\nLuminary\n, a roughly 400-foot-tall residential tower planned for the northwest corner of West 14th and Guadalupe streets,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal. The project had been targeting a late 2025 start, but will now wait out what the developer called unstable market conditions.\nNorthland Living President and COO Tony Kaleel said in an emailed statement to the outlet that a sales launch and groundbreaking were paused in order to wait for \u201cmore stable market conditions.\u201d\nThe pause comes as Austin\u2019s condo market tilts sharply in\nbuyers\u2019 favor\n. Local brokerage Team Price Real Estate reported that metro area condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units in December, more than double the supply from three years earlier. At the same time, prices have slid. The median\ncondo sale price\nfell to $337,500 in November, down from a peak of about $470,000 in April 2022.\nLuminary isn\u2019t alone. Across Austin,\nmultifamily towers\n, office projects and mixed-use developments have been delayed, resized or rethought, amid elevated vacancies, higher construction costs and lingering questions about long-term space demand from tech and other white-collar employers. Slower\nin-migration\nhas only added to the pressure, according to the publication.\nNorthland Living first unveiled plans for Luminary in January 2024, pitching a 354,616-square-foot tower designed by Page Southerland Page. A year later, the developer refined the concept to roughly 280 condos, ranging from 600 square feet to 2,700 square feet, along with ground-floor retail and a single level of office space. Prices were expected to start around $499,000 and climb above $3 million, with about half of the units priced below $1 million. Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales.\nThe site, which measures less than an acre, is currently occupied by two low-rise buildings, one housing the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which is slated to relocate into the new tower\u2019s office space when \u2014 or if \u2014 the project moves forward. Northland has secured a site development permit that runs through July 2028, giving it a long runway to restart construction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A failed luxury home deal on Wisconsin\u2019s Geneva Lake spilled into court, with the seller of a storied estate accusing a deep-pocketed Chicago buyer of tying up the property and blowing a $15 million hole in its value.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation sued financier and former pharmaceutical executive Jack McGinley, alleging that his $37.5 million offer to buy Aloha Lodge in Lake Geneva was binding, and that his eventual walkaway cost the estate crucial market momentum. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in Lake County, Wisconsin, claims breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing and seeks unspecified damages, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nAloha Lodge\n, a roughly 20,000-square-foot mansion on the south shore of Lake Geneva, which sits on 12 acres at 768 South Lake Shore Drive, ultimately sold in August 2024 for $21.9 million \u2014 far below both its original\n$35 million\nasking price and McGinley\u2019s offer. The foundation contends that McGinley\u2019s conduct forced that outcome. LSV Asset Management\u2019s James Owens was the buyer.\nAccording to the complaint, McGinley and his wife, Julie, executed a written offer in May 2023 to buy the estate for $37.5 million, which the foundation accepted the next day. Afterward, the suit alleges, McGinley sought information about other showings and competing bids and asked the seller to delay updating the multiple listing service to reflect an accepted offer. The foundation says the maneuver stalled activity and chilled interest in the property.\nComplicating matters, McGinley suffered a pulmonary embolism during the attorney review period, requiring emergency hospitalization. The foundation claims it was advised such a medical event could justify terminating a contract, but alleges McGinley instead used the moment to seek revised terms \u2014 including a delayed closing, a new health-related walkaway provision and a due diligence clause tied to renovation plans. No earnest money was ever delivered, the suit alleges, and McGinley ultimately abandoned the deal.\nMcGinley\u2019s attorney, John Ruskusky, flatly disputes that any binding contract existed. In a statement to the Tribune, Ruskusky said the offer was subject to attorney review, that McGinley requested reasonable changes the seller failed to address, and that the proposal became null and void by its own terms. He also cited McGinley\u2019s medical emergency as a factor in his decision not to proceed.\nAloha Lodge has deep\nChicago ties\n. The Southern colonial-style mansion was built in about 1900 for Tracy Drake, co-founder of the Drake and Blackstone hotels. Harold B. Smith, a longtime Illinois Tool Works executive, bought the property in 1998 and undertook a major renovation before his death in 2022. His foundation, formed in 2018, inherited the estate and listed it in 2023.\nThe lawsuit also points to a parallel deal gone sideways. About the same time as the Lake Geneva negotiations, McGinley had a contract to buy another foundation-owned estate in Palm Beach for $38 million, a deal he also exited. That property later sold for $29.3 million.\nThe foundation said accepting a lower price for Aloha Lodge directly harmed the nonprofit organizations it supports, including the Newberry Library and\nRush University System\nfor Health. Ruskusky rejected claims that McGinley has a pattern of breaching contracts, calling him a \u201chighly reputable\u201d buyer with a long track record of successful deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation long vowed to buy or build\naffordable housing\nand hold onto the properties in perpetuity \u2014 a commitment it is now poised to break.\nThe nonprofit landlord plans to put four\nTenderloin\n-area buildings on the market, which would mark the first asset sales in its history as the organization works to stabilize its balance sheet, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The\nnonprofit\nhas not disclosed expected asking prices and is soliciting broker proposals to market the assets either individually or as a package, with listings expected in January.\nThe soon-to-be-for-sale properties include the Dalt Hotel at 34 Turk Street, the West Hotel at 141 Eddy Street, Civic Center Residences at 44 McAllister Street and 270 Turk Street, which the nonprofit acquired in 2019 specifically to preserve long-term affordability. Together, the properties contain 581 units serving formerly homeless residents, seniors and tenants with health or substance abuse issues.\nJennifer Dolin, CEO of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, framed the decision as a necessary \u201cpivot\u201d to preserve the rest of the organization\u2019s more than 50-building portfolio.\n\u201cLike any real estate holding company, there are risks\u2026 and unfortunately, the headwinds and what\u2019s happened to us as a society has just made it impossible for us to keep pace,\u201d Dolin said. \u201cWe find ourselves in this really unfortunate and difficult position where we have to explore all possibilities.\u201d\nThe buildings are contending with vacancy rates between 12 and 22 percent, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation said. About 175 permanent\nsupportive housing\ntenants live in 183 units and receive rent subsidies and access to on-site services, while other apartments are capped for households earning up to 50 percent of area median income. City tenant protections generally prevent resident displacement during a sale. It remains unclear whether all affordability restrictions would remain intact over the long term as units turn over.\nThe strain on the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation\u2019s portfolio is affecting its development work as well. The organization is pausing two of its major construction efforts: a 199-unit senior housing project at 1234 Great Highway and a 120-unit affordable housing project at 149 Pennsylvania Street, Katie Lamont, COO for the nonprofit, said.\nThe sales by Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation could be an early warning sign for San Francisco\u2019s affordable housing sector.\nTenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation \u201cis the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Malcolm Yeung, executive director of local nonprofit landlord San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown Community Development Corporation, told the Chronicle. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a \u2018them\u2019 thing; it\u2019s a \u2018we\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
