        "content": "Lennar\nswitched land banks for 423 homesites in the Keys Gate residential subdivision in\nHomestead\nin a $24 million deal.\nJEN Partners\n, a New York-based firm that\u2019s served as a land bank for Lennar, sold the lots to DW Partners, also based in New York, according to records. The purchase price was $23.98 million.\nAs part of the deal, Lennar terminated its purchase option for the homesites with JEN and signed a purchase option agreement with DW Partners that\u2019s valid until 2031, records show.\nThe lots are roughly south of Southwest 344th Street and east of Southwest 162nd Avenue.\nDW Partners\n, led by David Warren and Robert Clark, is an alternative asset manager founded in 2009, according to its website.\nMiami-based Lennar, the second largest homebuilder nationwide and the\nbiggest in south Miami-Dade County\n, heavily relies on land banks to secure development sites years before it\u2019s ready to start building homes on them. The strategy allows the publicly traded Lennar to carry the cost of the land ownership off its balance sheet, freeing up its cash flow for developing homes, experts have said.\nAside from JEN, Lennar\u2019s other land bank partners include Scottsdale, Arizona-based Garrett Development and New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon. This year, the homebuilder also spun off\nMillrose Properties\n, its own publicly traded land bank.\nLennar is led by Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe.\nJaffe will retire\nfrom the firm this year.\nLocking in development sites in advance is also advantageous for Lennar in Miami-Dade due to the county\u2019s low supply of buildable sites. The south county area is the only remaining part of Miami-Dade with enough land for single-family and townhome communities.\nOver the past five years, developers have rushed to south Miami-Dade, scooping up sites and filing new project applications. Lennar has outpaced them all, completing nearly 70 percent of the homes finished in the area since 2020, according to Colliers Research. It also is developing 60 percent of the pipeline.\nAlso within the massive Keys Gate subdivision, Lennar filed a proposal in 2022 for\n1,335 homes\nand a golf course on 350 acres.\nOthers with stakes in Keys Gate include Miami-based Mast Capital, which paid\n$50.8 million\nfor a 292-townhome complex in 2021. The property is at 1140 Southeast 24th Road.\nOthers developing in south Miami-Dade include Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s biggest homebuilder. In Florida City, it proposed a\n108-townhome complex\nat 530 Southwest Third Avenue, 354 Southwest Seventh Street and two adjacent lots.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra wants to redevelop a portion of the South Dade Government Center at 10710, 10750 and 10800 Southwest 211th Street in Cutler Bay with a\n724-unit Live Local Act project\n. The first phase would consist of a pair of eight-story buildings with about 362 units and 458 parking spaces.\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump wiped away the federal case against Tim Leiweke, the powerhouse executive who helped build Oak View Group into a worldwide sports and entertainment venue developer.\nLeiweke\n, who stepped down as Oak View Group\u2019s CEO after his July indictment, was pardoned Dec. 2, according to a notice posted to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s website the following evening, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Leiweke had faced a single felony count of restraining trade tied to OVG\u2019s ultimately successful pursuit of a deal to develop the Moody Center arena at the University of Texas main campus in Austin.\nLeiweke is well known nationally for his years spent working for billionaire Philip Anschutz and Los Angeles-based AEG Worldwide, which owns the\nCrypto.com\narena and the Los Angeles Kings hockey club along with other venues around the U.S. and world. Leiweke later played a similar role with the Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment in Toronto before joining with music industry veteran Irv Azoff to form Oak View Group, which operates a roster of facilities ranging from the UBS Arena in New York to the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago and several Texas properties also in the mix.\nProsecutors alleged he conspired with Legends Hospitality in 2018 to rig the bidding, convincing a rival firm to back off in exchange for future contracts once the Austin venue opened. If convicted, he faced up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.\nThe pardon arrives five months after the indictment forced Leiweke \u2014 one of the most recognizable operators in sports and entertainment real estate \u2014 to relinquish the CEO role at the Denver-based firm he co-founded.\nOak View Group\nsecured non-prosecution agreements in the case, paying a $15 million fine, while Legends paid $1.5 million. Leiweke consistently maintained his innocence, arguing that collaborating on the bid was a standard strategy for a young company competing for marquee projects.\nLeiweke\nexpressed deep gratitude to\nTrump\nin a statement to Sports Business Journal, calling the case a \u201clong and difficult journey\u201d for his family. A jury trial had been scheduled for May 4 after being pushed from an initial December date.\nThe timing wasn\u2019t subtle. Hours before the pardon became public, Oak View Group formally named veteran sports executive Chris Granger its permanent CEO. Granger had been serving in an interim capacity since Leiweke\u2019s departure and is now tasked with steadying a company that has ballooned into a global powerhouse, managing and developing arenas, stadiums and live-entertainment districts across North America and abroad.\nOak View Group struck a supportive note in a statement to SBJ, saying it was \u201chappy for Tim that he can now put this matter behind him\u201d while emphasizing its focus on clients under Granger\u2019s leadership. The company opened and operates the Moody Center, which has become a major anchor for Austin\u2019s live-events economy since debuting in 2022.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Jogani brothers are back at it.\nTwo of the brothers are suing a niece and nephew, among other parties, for $775 million. The two allege their niece and nephew were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother.\nThe brother named as a culprit in the suit is Haresh Jogani, who was\nordered\nin 2024 to pay plaintiffs Rajesh and Chetan Jogani, and their other brothers, to settle a two-decade dispute over the family\u2019s portfolio of 17,000 or so apartment units in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles; the payout verdict was valued at about $10 billion.\nNow Rajesh and Chetan Jogani claim their brother made payments to his children \u2014 the niece and nephew of the plaintiffs \u2014 in order to siphon off and hide assets from real estate management and diamond businesses, according to a complaint dated late-November, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\nThe current accusations are flying as the prior case is in the courts on appeal.\nThe first\nlegal brawl\nended with Haresh being ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan a combined $1.5 billion in punitive damages. Rajesh and Chetan also were awarded punitive damages and a 10 percent and six and a half percent stake, respectively, in the\nmultifamily real estate portfolio\nthat was at the center of the case.\nA total of five Jogani brothers came to Los Angeles from India, and eventually amassed a fortune in real estate and diamonds.\nThe latest complaint claims Jeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani \u2014 Haresh\u2019s children and the nephew and niece of Rajesh and Chetan \u2014 together received $225 million \u201clooted\u201d from three real estate entities. The case contends that all brothers own the businesses.\nThe two plaintiffs contend that a court-appointed receiver gave Haresh \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the businesses for a period of time, leading to illegitimate payments to his children.\n\u201cHaresh treated the partnership companies as his personal piggy bank,\u201d the complaint alleges, and \u201ctook advantage of his position, to loot billions of dollars, without making proportionate distributions to his brothers.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan claim their niece and nephew held roles at the three real estate entities before a receiver terminated them. The two brothers argue that neither performed substantial work or contributed to profitability, that they received $25 million bonuses in the middle of the prior trial. The two brothers claim the monetary transfers exceed reasonable compensation, and that Haresh allowed them to \u201chinder and delay plaintiffs\u2019 ability to collect the amounts that Haresh owes to them.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan allege the \u201cdefendants\u2019 conduct was malicious, oppressive, and done with the intent to defraud.\u201d\nThe two are suing for treble damages, a legal remedy where the court is required to award the plaintiff three times the amount of actual damages determined by the jury as punitive measure. In this case, the actual damages are $225 million, per the suit, therefore treble damages amount to $775 million.\nJeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani could not be immediately reached for comment. The two do not appear to have retained attorneys based on available information.\nTheir father Haresh\u2019s prior attorney, Rick Richmond, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Ross, an attorney who represented Rajesh and Chetan in the prior case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A long-stalled Arlington Heights apartment development just bought itself another year.\nVillage trustees approved a 12-month extension this week for zoning approvals tied to Mylo Arlington Heights, a six-story, 135-unit project that has been unable to break ground since securing entitlements in 2022. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the reprieve keeps the plan alive at\n116-120 West Eastman Street\n, where two obsolete office buildings \u2014 including one with a basement that once housed the 1960s teen club called The Cellar \u2014 have sat vacant on the edge of the village\u2019s downtown.\nDeveloper\nJoe Taylor\nIII of Compasspoint Development said the hurdles holding up the $66 million transit-oriented project are the same ones dogging multifamily proposals across the Chicago suburbs. Interest rates have pushed banks and debt funds to retreat from construction lending. Equity investors are hesitant too, Taylor said, because they can pick up existing northwest suburban apartment buildings at or below replacement cost. And construction pricing continues to rise, strained by higher materials costs, a tight labor pool and uncertainty around tariffs and inflation.\nEven so, Taylor told trustees he expects 2026 to be the year that it finally becomes realistic to see shovels dig in the dirt on West Eastman. The new zoning deadline requires Compasspoint to secure permits and begin construction by December 18, 2026.\nThe plan calls for a midrise building with a ground-floor restaurant and a renter base ranging from young professionals to local downsizers \u2014 a demographic mix\nArlington Heights\nhas been courting as redevelopment clusters near its Metra train station.\nTaylor said the extension provides enough runway to finalize design, engineering and construction pricing by the second quarter of 2026, with delivery and lease-up targeted for 2028.\nTrustee Tom Schwingbeck pressed him on whether that\u2019s achievable. Taylor insisted it is.\n\u201cI don\u2019t envision us coming back for a second time for a second extension,\u201d Taylor said at the meeting. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get everything done.\u201d\nMuch of his confidence stems from new capital partners. Taylor said he has teamed up with Richard Wolper, founder of Utah-based luxury homebuilder Mark 25 Homes, who in turn has long-standing financing relationships with\nD.A. Davidson\nand SDP Real Estate Investment Trust.\nThose alliances, Taylor said, open doors to construction and long-term debt that smaller suburban developers often struggle to access, saying his new partners are well-capitalized and committed to financing the project.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It\u2019s the latest in a string of updates to the troubled site, which has gone through a few tweaks this year.\nThe latest vision increases the size.\nThe project is now slated to include 272 units, with 69 studios, 108 one-bedrooms and 95 two-bedrooms; of those, 42 units will be set aside for deed-restricted affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households.\nThe building will rise 257 feet, spanning 303,000 square feet, including 29,000 square feet of parking across two levels with space for 164 cars and 180 bicycles. Amenities include a podium-top courtyard and a rooftop deck spanning about 9,800 square feet.\nA previous version called for building 20 stories with 258 residential units.\nIn 2017,\nTrammell Crow Company\nreceived an entitlement for an eight-story apartment complex and sold the project to Leap Development the following year.\nLeap began construction in 2019 but suspended work the following year, allowing the site to collect water before a 2024 public nuisance lawsuit from City Attorney\nDavid Chiu accused\nLeap of abandoning the partially excavated development site. An affiliate of Leap allegedly owed more than $1 million in fines after\ndefaulting on a $10 million loan\nsecured by the property.\nThe 0.2-acre property sold for about $1.3 million earlier this year. Thompson Builders, Leap\u2019s former contractor, had previously filed plans for 115 condominium units with no ground-floor retail; that iteration included 31 studios, 31 one-bedrooms, 36 two-bedrooms and 17 three-bedrooms.\nThompson\u2019s latest application estimates construction costs at just under $69 million. Work is expected to begin next summer and wrap up as early as 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Miami homeowner is accusing the city of attempting to take private property via an allegedly abusive permitting process, a scheme that may affect more than 1,000 homes in Miami, a lawsuit claims.\nCharles \u201cChad\u201d Trausch filed an amended complaint against the city on Wednesday. He first sued the city eight months ago over the city\u2019s demands that he transfer a portion of his front yard to the city for the public right-of-way. He filed the lawsuit \u200b\u200bpro se, which means he was representing himself, in April.\nTrausch and his wife Stephanie paid $710,000 for their house in the\nBuena Vista neighborhood\n, just north of the Design District, in 2021.\nWhen his wife was expecting their baby, they sought a permit for an addition so they could accommodate more family. Trausch submitted an application to the city\u2019s zoning department for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom addition to his Miami home last year, but the city notified him that it would not issue a permit for the project until Trausch conveyed a permanent deed for a portion of his front yard, according to the complaint.\n\u201cFor twenty months, the city withheld [Trausch\u2019s] permit because he refused to give up half his front yard,\u201d the lawsuit states. Once Trausch hired attorneys, \u201cthe city suddenly decided to \u2018approve\u2019 [Trausch\u2019s] waiver request\u201d without explanation.\nSince Trausch submitted his permit application in the spring of 2024, \u201cthe cost of construction materials and labor exploded,\u201d and his lawyers estimate it will\ncost\nhim more than $200,000 to complete the addition.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys, who include Ari Bargil and Suranjan Sen of the\nInstitute for Justice\n, wrote in the amended complaint that the city of Miami has been taking property by \u201csystematically extorting hundreds of Miami residents.\u201d The Institute for Justice said it has identified 66 streets with more than 1,000 homes \u201cat threat to this scheme.\u201d\nA city spokesperson said they would respond to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment but has not yet provided a comment.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys argued that the city can\u2019t expand any right-of-way without paying the property owner for the land. Miami\u2019s procedures \u201csubject people to a shakedown,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit accuses the city of violating the\nFifth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution regarding the uncompensated taking of private property and due process.\nWhen a homeowner seeks a land-use permit, for example to build an addition, the city demands an expanded right-of-way to match the parcel\u2019s base building line. Base building lines are setbacks where owners can\u2019t build, but where they still own the land. But the city has been seeking the land via deeds instead, Trausch and his attorneys allege.\nThe Institute for Justice said that Miami has been getting homeowners to deed land over for right-of-ways for years, citing a city employee\u2019s testimony in a federal case with Trausch\u2019s neighbor that there have been \u201chundreds\u201d of these demands. The city is landbanking so that it can eventually widen roads on the affected streets.\n",

        "content": "Florida Republicans moved forward four proposals to reduce\nproperty taxes\nin the state, in spite of growing fears of funding impacts to local and emergency services.\nThe House State Affairs Committee approved four proposed constitutional amendments this week,\nCBS News\nreported. Among them is HJR 201, which would eliminate non-school homestead property taxes and could cut local government revenue by $14.1 billion in the first year it is implemented, and up to $18 billion in later years, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n.\nIn addition to HJR 201, Republicans voted on party lines to pass HJR 205, which would do away with non-school property taxes for homestead properties whose owners are 65 and older; HJR 209, which would eliminate non-school property taxes for homestead properties with\ninsurance coverage\n; and HJR 211, which would remove the $500,000 limit on transferring the property tax benefit to a new homestead.\nAll four amendments require approval by 60 percent of voters to become law, although it\u2019s unclear if and which of the bills will appear on ballots next November.\nRepublican lawmakers started work on these proposals after Gov. Ron DeSantis started calling to completely abolish property taxes, skewering them as \u201crent to the government.\u201d\nAn analysis\nby listings site Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner shows an outright elimination of property taxes would immediately increase property values between 7 and 9 percent. The aggregate value of Florida\u2019s owner-occupied housing stock would spike from $200 billion to $250 billion, the report showed. But the benefits would be uneven, Berner said.\n\u201cIt would be a boon to existing property owners,\u201d he told Realtor.com. \u201cBut this measure would disproportionately benefit wealthy Floridians at the expense of those who don\u2019t own homes, and would make it even harder to break into homeownership because of the increased prices.\u201d\nOpponents of the cuts also say it could induce a fiscal crisis for local governments, and leave crucial services like EMS, fire departments and road maintenance underfunded. Local leaders, including the Florida Association of Counties, Florida League of Cities, and Florida Fire Chiefs Association, have all raised fears about the consequences of billions lost in funding.\n\u201cThis is the biggest, \u2018bro, just trust me,\u2019 that I have ever seen in my life,\u201d State Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Miami Democrat, told the State Affairs Committee, according to published reports. \u201cHow many firefighters are dispensable? That\u2019s the question.\u201d\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "One Houston developer sees opportunity in the void Macy\u2019s left when its Alameda Mall location shuttered earlier this year.\nRead King, which bought the former 23-acre Macy\u2019s property at the southeast Houston mall in fall 2024, is moving ahead with plans to convert the two-story, 290,000-square-foot department store into an indoor marketplace dubbed The Market at Almeda.\nThe mall, which is situated at the nexus of Interstate 45, Almeda Genoa Road, Kleckly Drive and Kingspoint Road,\nThe Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the shift comes months after\nMacy\u2019s\nshuttered the location as part of a 66-store national pullback. Read King leased the location back to Macy\u2019s after its purchase until March of this year, leaving the 57-year-old mall without a major draw.\nRead King\nsenior associate Travis Read told the outlet that the firm is negotiating with a grocer, a fitness center and a beauty school for the reimagined space. The grocer would anchor the project with about 65,000 square feet on the first floor, while the rest of the ground level would be carved into restaurant and retail bays along the building\u2019s east and west faces. Roughly 44,000 square feet upstairs would be leased to smaller tenants, with remaining space used for utilities.\nInstead of the full teardown the developer initially contemplated, Read King opted to adapt the hulking structure, citing its fortress-like construction, high visibility from Interstate 45 and the steep cost of ground-up replacement. Plans to reclad the exterior and install new glass storefronts will bring what Read called a \u201cretro vibe\u201d that nods to the mall\u2019s history. Bellaire-based Boucher Design Group is leading the architectural work.\nAcross Kleckley Drive, the firm plans to add a detention pond and two pad sites for sale or ground lease \u2014 likely to restaurant or retail users. Permitting is underway, with a groundbreaking expected in early 2025, though Read declined to disclose development costs.\nAlmeda Mall\nitself has been in long-term decline, having lost its Burlington anchor last year and cycling through tenants as national chains retrench. Current occupants include DD\u2019s Discounts, Foot Locker and Bath &amp; Body Works, plus a small food court. It\u2019s separately owned by South Florida-based\n4th Dimension Properties\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Not a compelling argument against it, Mr. Kwan!\nBut I don\u2019t want to pick on a long-serving, unpaid board member. I am one myself. Fortunately, City Council member Eric Dinowitz voiced an even more illogical argument for me to highlight.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more prudent to just get more data, get better data before we invariably increase the risk for individual board members and increase the costs for shareholders?\u201d he said, according to\nSheridan Wall\u2019s article\n.\nDid you pick up on Dinowitz\u2019s hypocrisy? It\u2019s subtle at first but becomes clearer if you read his quote two or three times.\nDinowitz demands data while saying something wholly unsupported by data. To quote Dinowitz, before making claims, wouldn\u2019t it be prudent for him to just get more and better data showing the bill would \u201cinvariably\u201d increase the risk and costs for shareholders?\nAll he has to do is look at what happened in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties after they passed similar legislation. Spoiler alert: Nothing. There was no increase in lawsuits filed by rejected buyers.\n\u201cThere is nothing about writing a letter that increases your costs,\u201d Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, told me. \u201cAnd the idea that there\u2019s an army of lawyers out there waiting to feast off non-compliant disclosures is patently absurd.\u201d\nAs readers of\nThe Real Deal\nknow, I often criticize Council bills that would create compliance headaches but little or no benefit. And I have not hesitated to call out Council member\nPierina Sanchez\nor Public Advocate\nJumaane Williams\nwhen I think they\u2019re wrong.\nBut, like most real estate agents, I believe they\u2019re right that people applying to buy into a co-op deserve a timely answer from the board and to know why they are rejected. Fears of litigation have not been borne out where such laws were implemented.\nIt\u2019s quite possible that bidders who are kept in limbo or rejected without explanation are\nmore\nlikely to sue. Give them answers and they tend to move on with their house hunting.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nChristine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit WIN (formerly Women In Need) came up with a Chutes and Ladders-style\nboard game\nto cleverly demonstrate the pitfalls families face while navigating the city\u2019s\nlong, complicated process\nto get affordable housing. Should the Real Estate Board of New York come up with a landlord\u2019s version for any particular program? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: With Steve Buscemi\u2019s sale of his Park Slope townhouse, there might be no movie stars left in Park Slope other than John Turturro. The neighborhood previously lost Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, and probably some others that I\u2019m forgetting. Kelly McGillis (Tom Cruise\u2019s love interest in the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d) is long gone from the brownstone on Garfield Place she had in the 1980s.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIn a recent \u201cwhat we\u2019re thinking about\u201d item, I asked if real estate firms are susceptible to the same kind of corruption that led to the conviction of 70 NYCHA employees for taking kickbacks from contractors they hired.\nOne industry veteran replied: \u201cThere is NO question that landlords, property managers, and \u2014 I would toss in \u2014 contractors and architectural firms are vulnerable to their employees\u2019 dishonesty.\u201d\nIt seems to me that whenever one person is spending another person\u2019s money, kickbacks will be a temptation.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$7.8 million\nfor a 7,414-square-foot condominium unit at 87 Leonard Street in Tribeca. Emily Beare, Lexi Alper and Beth Doud Tomashoff with CORE had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.5 million\nfor a former Family Dollar store at 224-11 Linden Boulevard in Cambria Heights.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.75 million\nfor a co-op unit at The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side. Daniela Kunen with Douglas Elliman has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 15,230-square-foot, 18-unit project at 715 East 224th Street in Wakefield. Mohammad Badaly filed the permit.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Sometimes all it takes is one big fish.\nThe hush-hush ultra-luxury offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development at 80 Clarkson Street is the first Manhattan condo project to crack a projected sellout of over $2 billion since the\ninfamous Xi from HFZ Capital in 2018\n.\nThe two-tower project along the West Side Highway helped push the total sellout for the 10 most expensive condo projects in Manhattan above the $3 billion mark for the first time in the last three years.\nThat $3 billion serves as a new benchmark shows how far removed the city is from the boomtown years when multiple projects each year would cross the billion-dollar sellout threshold.\nAfter 80 Clarkson, which represents a staggering 63 percent of the total sellout volume of the top 10 condos filed this year, there is not a single project with a projected volume of over $400 million.\nPart of the low-key totals may be due to buildings holding back on pricing all of their units. MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residence at 126 East 57th Street, for example, only has pricing on 38 of its 145 residential units, which explains why the project, which sits on the eastern end of Billionaires\u2019 Row, has a sellout of just over $100 million.\nAt the same time, top projects in recent years have continued to shrink. Of the top 10 condo filings, half have fewer than 50 units.\nThe years of dwindling sellouts may be catching up with the city, as multiple development marketing firms are projecting\nrecord-low inventory levels\nheading into 2026.\nDetails on the 10 most expensive projects that are underway and filed this year can be found below, which\nThe Real Deal\nanalyzed using plans filed with the attorney general and data from New York City.\n80 Clarkson Street | $2.2B\nAfter years of slicing and dicing its valuable land holdings along the West Side Highway, Atlas Capital Group partnered up with Zeckendorf Development to launch 80 Clarkson, the\nmost expensive project the city has seen in years\n.\nWith Baupost as equity partner, Atlas and the Zeckendorfs bought out another developer from the site with a\n$322 million loan from Blackstone\nin 2022 before going on to secure the largest residential construction loan in the city since the pandemic, a\n$985 million construction loan\nfrom Cale Street Partners and Farallon Capital Management.\nAll of that financing has helped build out some of the most expensive units in Downtown Manhattan, including an\n$80 million penthouse\nthat spans over 7,000 square feet.\nBut time will tell if all the investment has paid off, as the building hasn\u2019t reported a single contract since launching sales earlier this year. Cookfox is designing the building, and an in-house team led by Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson is overseeing sales.\n400 East 84th Street | $328M\nRelated Companies has bucked the trend of converting buildings into rentals by instead turning rentals into condos at The Strathmore on 400 East 84th Street on the Upper East Side.\nAfter securing a $100 million refinancing from Tyko Capital on the 48-story building earlier this year, Related set about converting the long-time rental building to capitalize on the growing demand in the Upper East Side.\nPricing is running relatively affordable for the area, with one bedrooms starting at $1.1 million and the most expensive four-bedroom units topping out around $5.5 million.\nThe 144-unit development is being designed by Tony Ingrao and Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group launched sales in October.\n142 West 21st Street | $170M\nYiannes Einhorn\u2019s Grid Group is turning a former two-story parking garage in Chelsea into a high-end condo building at 142 West 21st Street. It\nbought the site for $31 million in 2021\n.\nDesigned by BKSK Architects, the development, called The Myles, features 16 parking spaces for its 22 units. The priciest condo is the 13th-floor five-bedroom penthouse with a private rooftop spa pool, going for $17 million.\nNicole Hechter and Masayo Hashimoto of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group are leading sales and marketing for the project.\n201 East 23rd Street | $164M\nAfter claiming the top two spots in last year\u2019s top condo filing list, Naftali Group came in fourth this year with its project The Willow at 201 East 23rd Street in Kips Bay.\nIn 2023, Naftali\npaid $21.5 million to lease the site\nfor 99 years from Snake River Development, an entity of BNS Real Estate. Designed by Cookfox, the 19-story brick facade will have 69 units, a private courtyard, rooftop terrace, fitness center and screening room.\nAlexa Lambert and Compass New Development Marketing launched sales in April and closings are expected to begin next year. The building is more than halfway sold, according to Marketproof.\n133 East 55th Street | $132M\nA joint venture from Rybak Development and BK Developers is developing a 20-story condo building on the corners of Lexington Avenue and 55th Street.\nThe team purchased the site for $24 million in 2021 and secured a $52 million construction loan from Emerald Creek Capital last year. The project will house 31 condos and include amenities like a spa complex, fitness center, and outdoor rec area.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $10 million for a three-bedroom penthouse.\nZproekt Architecture is designing the building and sales do not appear to have launched yet.\n350 East 18th Street | $116M\nA joint venture from Israeli-based Minrav Development and NYC-based T&amp;E 1 Development is developing a 54-unit condo project in Gramercy.\nThe developers picked up the site for $28.5 million in 2020 and secured a $63 million construction from Northwind Group in 2024.\nDesigned by ARC Architecture + Design Studio, the building will include 18 parking spaces, a full-time doorman, gym and rooftop terrace. Prices start at under $2 million for a one-bedroom and up to $6 million for a three-bedroom penthouse, which is one of the 14 units in contract at the building, according to Marketproof.\nJohn Gomes and Fredrik Eklund of the Eklund Gomes Team and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n24-28 West 9th Street | $115M\nOphir Sternberg\u2019s Lionheart Capital is turning a pre-war apartment building into 45 luxury condos on a coveted stretch of Greenwich Village.\nSternberg bought the property for $41.5 million in 2022 and Stonehill Taylor designed the conversion of the 1923 building.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $5 million for a three-bedroom penthouse with 1,270 square feet of outdoor space. Shlomi Reuveni\u2019s Reuveni Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n126 East 57th Street | $111M\nA development triumvirate led by Rotem Rosen is developing the newest Billionaires\u2019 Row entrant, the Malabar Residences.\nIn 2019, Rosen, Israeli developer Zahi Hagag and Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra\u2019s\ndropped almost $104 million cash\non a 13-parcel assemblage. The developers then secured a\n$170 million construction loan\nfrom Bank OZK in 2022 for their roughly 350-foot-tall project.\nThe developers have only released pricing for roughly a quarter of the 145 units in the building, and prices range from under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $12 million for a three-bedroom penthouse. Designed by ODA Architecture, the building includes a fitness center, swimming pool, spa pool, steam room, sauna and indoor half-basketball court.\nThe project has moved in fits and starts. Rosen\u2019s development firm MRR had to\nplead with a court\nnot once, but twice, to grant access to a neighboring property in order to continue work on the project.\nEarlier this year, the project lost its sales director when\nNoble Black\ndecamped to Corcoran\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Maria Mainieri took over as sales director, according to her website, and is marketing the building along with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\n118 West 13th Street | $92M\nSlate Property Group has claim to the smallest development on the list with their project at 118 West 13th Street dubbed The Katherine.\nIn 2021, Slate\nbought the site for $22.9 million\nwith private equity partner Avenue Realty Capital and gutted the seven-story building. Incredibly, the 34,000-square-foot property once housed 175 students as a dorm for The New School. BKSK Architects and designer Nate Berkus converted the building into just eight residences starting at just under $10 million.\nSeven of the units have already sold since Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg launched sales in the spring with Compass Development Marketing. The remaining available condo is the top-floor penthouse, asking over $22 million.\n114 East 25th Street | $74M\nAdellco has already sold through its 20 units at the Armorie after announcing its planned sales launch in February. The trick? Sell them all to one buyer.\nThe developer bought the commercial building from crowdfunding firm Prodigy Network and Shorewood Real Estate Group for $41.3 million five years ago in order to convert it into condos.\nAfter Corcoran Group\u2019s Hottinger Team started quietly marketing the residential units in the spring, a buyer came forward with an offer to buy them and the building\u2019s commercial space for $71 million. The buyer was a private family office, Adellco founder and CEO Matthew Adell previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nConstruction is expected to be complete in the first quarter of next year and amenities will include a gym, roof deck and lounge. Andre Kikoski Architecture is designing the building.",

        "content": "The vultures are circling\ntroubled multifamily investor Jon Venetos\n.\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was hit with two new lawsuits from Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, filings with Dallas County District Court show.\nKeybank is asking the court to appoint an emergency receiver for the properties tied to the loans: Villa Del Tesoro, at 7802 Villa Cliff Drive, and 46 Eleven, at 4611 Samuell Boulevard. Both are in Dallas.\nThe bank alleges Venetos defaulted on the $16.85 million loan tied to the 229-unit Villas Del Tesoro and the $7.15 million loan tied to 79-unit 46 Eleven. Keybank originated the loans on a refinance of the properties in October 2024. It claims Venetos personally guaranteed the loans.\nVenetos stopped paying monthly interest payments on the loans in June, and failed to pay them off when they matured in October, Keybank claims. In addition, he stopped paying property taxes and insurance for the properties and allowed liens to be placed against them, Keybank said in the filing.\nThe lender further alleges that Venetos transferred a total of $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account. Inspections conducted in October 2025 revealed multiple units out of commission in each property, deferred repairs and mold, the bank said.\nLeaving the properties in Venetos\u2019 control \u201cthreatens to accelerate the deterioration\u201d of the assets.\nThe Keybank filings are the latest in a passel of default lawsuits from Venetos\u2019 lenders.\nHe started losing properties in April, when Acore claimed he defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas and started\nauctioning off the Florida properties\n. Acore also claims he personally guarantied the loans and is asking for an\n$81 million judgment\nagainst him.\nIn the last three months, Venetos has been hit with a succession of lawsuits, starting with one\nfrom Select Securities Europe\n, which accused him of defaulting on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million. There was a\nlawsuit from Fannie Mae\n, accusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex.\nVista Bank also sued him\n, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex. Vista alleges Venetos still owes $3 million.\nThere\u2019s a fraud element to Vista\u2019s accusation. In the suit, it accused him of \u201cattempting to obtain credit at another financial institution using false, altered, or fraudulent account statements of Vista.\u201d\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

        "content": "Ortsac Capital Group bought a 206-unit apartment complex in Pembroke Pines for $52.5 million, marking a slight discount from its purchase price six years ago.\nThe deal at a 5.6 percent discount comes amid higher\ninterest rates\nand South Florida\u2019s multifamily market\nslowdown\ncompared to the post-pandemic boom.\nOrtsac\n, led by married couple Bobby and Sofia Castro, bought the Ventura Pointe property at 7850 Pasadena Boulevard from Dallas-based\nLloyd Jones\n, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The price breaks down to $254,854 per apartment.\nThe buyer assumed the seller\u2019s existing $38.6 million loan from MetLife Real Estate Lending and refinanced it as a Fannie Mae loan, bumping up the total $45 million.\nCompleted in 2018 on nearly 10 acres, the complex consists of two five-story buildings and two four-story buildings, Vizzda records show. Palm Beach Gardens-based\nEastwind Development\nbuilt Ventura Pointe.\nLloyd Jones, led by Christopher Finlay, paid\n$55.6 million\nfor Ventura Pointe in 2019, records show.\nThe firm, a multifamily and senior housing investor, has developed, owned and managed about $1.2 billion in multifamily properties since 1990, according to its website.\nFort Lauderdale-based Ortsac, a private family office also led by the Castro couple\u2019s children and grandchildren, has a portfolio of more than $700 million of multifamily assets under management and investments in commercial real estate, its website says. Bobby, who describes himself as a self-made entrepreneur, and Sofia Castro founded and owned\nBankers Healthcare Group\n, which they sold. They also founded and lead Stack and Rack, a three-day multifamily investment bootcamp, according to the Castros\u2019 LinkedIns and Bobby\u2019s website.\nIn 2021, Ortsac sold the 368-unit Lakeview Flats apartment complex at 8800 Northwest 78th Court and 8900 Northwest 77th Court in Tamarac for\n$69 million\n. That same year, it sold the 368-unit Golfview Flats apartment complex at 8445 Springtree Drive in Sunrise for\n$15 million\n.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market boomed in the years after the pandemic\u2019s onset due to an influx of out-of-staters, creating unprecedented demand and\nrecord rent growth\n.\nBut after developers seized on the bonanza with a flurry of new projects, the region experienced a record\n18,600 completions\nlast year just as the pipeline of new residents slowed. This led to slower lease-ups and a drop in rents, with Realtor.com showing the median asking rent in the tri-county region decreased 3 percent in October, year-over-year.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive increases in 2022 and 2023. As a result, some landlords are struggling to refinance maturing loans or meet debt obligations on floating-rate debt. Some lenders retrenched from issuing new loans while they worked out extensions and forbearance agreements with existing borrowers.\nDiscounted multifamily deals have popped up in South Florida.\nIn September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit Solena West Miami complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for\n$111 million\n, marking a 4.7 percent discount from its previous $116.4 million price. Waterton had bought the two-building complex in two deals in 2016 and 2017.\nLast year, Rreef Property Trust sold the 368-unit Marela complex at 250 Northwest 130th Avenue in Pembroke Pines for\n$110 million\n, or 9 percent less than the firm had paid in 2021.\n",

As Ritz-Carlton\u2019s first stand-alone condo project in Texas, it adds a new level of luxury to the state\u2019s burgeoning condo market.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\n\u201cHe was very much involved from day one,\u201d he said.\nCities like New York and Miami are swimming in high-end condo projects, but in Texas, luxury residential real estate has long revolved around the ranch. The Ritz-Carlton Residences is a big swing that will test demand for high-end vertical living.\nSo far, it\u2019s looking like a big swing worth taking. Before the foundation was laid, 69 percent of the 111 units were pre-sold, prompting Howard Hughes to pause presales and open up a waitlist.\nCruz contends that the project has opened the floodgates of branded condos in Houston by giving others \u201cthe courage to follow suit.\u201d Since the Ritz started taking shape, Sunny Bathija\u2019s Satya unveiled plans for a standalone St. Regis condo tower in Houston\u2019s Rice/Military. Deiso Moss announced it\u2019s building a Ritz-Carlton condo tower and hotel in Houston\u2019s Uptown/Galleria neighborhood.\nThe project sits on 8 acres on Lake Woodlands and includes a 15-story building and an 11-story. The design highlights the scenic lakefront with views across the lake.\nStern was inspired by Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood, Cruz said, so the project was designed to incorporate the tradition of John Staub, the early-20th century residential architect who designed single-family homes throughout the prestigious enclave.\nCruz describes Staub\u2019s style as having \u201ca restrained sense of detail\u201d and \u201ctimeless design\u201d\nCruz touched on what makes the project unique at an\nOctober event\nthat was part of BSH and The Real Deal\u2019s Building Luxury series.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences was also designed with the end-user in mind. Many Houston condo buyers are empty-nesters who are downsizing from single-family homes. To ease the transition to vertical living, the design offers a uniquely wide variety of apartment layouts to provide buyers with the sense of individuality baked into the single-family home. Of the 111 units, 55 are unique.\n\u201cAll beautiful American neighborhoods have variety in terms of the houses,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cSo that same attitude, but combined in a condominium.\u201d\nThe Ritz project will be RAMSA\u2019s ninth in Texas.\nThe firm designed the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas, a 70-unit condo tower that includes hotel amenities. The brick and limestone building is designed in a simplified Regency style.\nThe firm\u2019s other Texas projects are mostly public landmarks. RAMSA designed the upgrade for the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas as well as the George W. Bush Presidential Center, also at Southern Methodist University.\n",

        "content": "Rockwood Capital\u2019s Christmas wish came true: it sold its Midtown office tower near Grand Central Terminal. But it may feel like a stocking of coal compared to previous offloading efforts.\nSovereign Partners sealed the deal on a $273 million acquisition of 2 Grand Central Tower on Thursday, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal for the 667,000-square-foot property breaks down to $409 per square foot.\nThis year, Rockwood put the property on the market, seeking a sale price of roughly $270 million. The last time the private equity investor tried to sell, back in February 2020 (shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic hit), Rockwood had expected to sell the tower for\nclose to $580 million\n, more than double its more recent aspiration.\nRockwood purchased the office building in 2011 from Boston Properties, now BXP, for $401 million. Boston Properties bought it for almost $428 million in 2008 from Harry Macklowe, who developed it.\nThe Promote\nreported\nthat Sovereign Partners was finalizing a deal for the office building towards the end of October, but it didn\u2019t close until this week.\nEastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the transaction. Buyer and seller did not return requests for comment from the Observer.\nRockwood\nsecured\na $262.6 million refinancing of the 44-story tower in July, replacing the previous $260 million loan on the property made in 2018; both loans came courtesy of MetLife, which is providing $177 million in acquisition financing to Sovereign.\nTenants include the Nuvo Group, Maersk, Cigna and various financial, legal and professional services firms. Rockwood also has its headquarters in the building.\nRockwood recently announced that it would integrate its operations into Harrison Street Asset Management; the two companies are subsidiaries of Colliers International. Two months ago, it listed the 230,000-square-foot office building at 1 Broadway in the Financial District, seeking\n$180 million\n.\nCyrus and Darius Sakhai\u2019s Sovereign Partners are investors in the Midtown East market. Last year, it bought 780 Third Avenue from Nuveen for $178 million. Earlier, Sovereign Partners landed 100-104 FIfth Avenue from Clarion Partners for the\nheavily discounted price\nof $125 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "What keeps New York\u2019s top commercial real estate players awake at night? Politics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s political risk at all levels,\u201d Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau said during a panel discussion on Wednesday. \u201cNational, state and city.\u201d\nBlau joined a group of CRE heavyweights \u2014 Bill Rudin of Rudin Management, Winston Fisher of Fisher Brothers and Mary Ann Tighe of CBRE \u2014 on stage at the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate capital markets conference to discuss, among other things, the looming uncertainty posed by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\nPanelists weighed the broader social proposals Mamdani has championed. Free childcare and subsidized transportation, Fisher argued, aren\u2019t just social gestures, they\u2019re economic levers that could keep more families in the city. The cost of early childhood care is a massive tax on the working and middle class, he said. He also proposed offering free bus service to select groups, like CUNY students, noting that transportation costs prevent many from completing their degrees.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real estate angle that he\u2019s talking about, but it is infinitely deeper than that,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe are tethered to New York. We have to help him solve these problems because they are growing every day.\u201d\nBut Tighe cautioned against comingling housing legislation with social mandates.\n\u201cOne of the challenges for this mayor is there\u2019s a lot of virtue signaling going on \u2014 free this, free that,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cBut the reality of it is, you have to understand if you want to build housing, focus on building housing. Because if there\u2019s anything that history has shown us, you make a clear, crisp piece of legislation that has a target, and these folks will make it a reality.\u201d\nBlau said he is hopeful that Mamdani will continue the current mayor\u2019s initiatives that encourage companies to come to New York.\n\u201cThe reason companies come here is because talent wants to be here,\u201d Blau said. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s job to make New York City the place where people want to continue to come.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s housing shortage dominated much of the discussion. Rudin zeroed in on the vacant rent-stabilized units kept off the market due to restrictions on rent increases.\n\u201cRaise that cap, you would see within six months these units come back on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the mayor-elect, we\u2019ve told him and his people.\u201d\nAll the panelists emphasized the need for the city government to work with private developers to draft legislation that makes sense. Not surprisingly, they were critical of the city\u2019s 485x tax break, which includes a wage floor that kicks in for projects with 100 or more units, making it difficult for large projects to pencil out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a plethora of opportunities to continue to create more housing,\u201d Fisher said, adding that there needs to be incentive for the private sector. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub. I think if he allows private capital to come in and have an adequate return, private capital will build.\u201d\nDespite the clear uncertainty, the panel struck a cautiously optimistic tone. Fisher and Tighe highlighted New York\u2019s resilience, cultural vibrancy and tolerance for difference as reasons to believe the city can thrive, whatever way the political winds blow. While his ideology is unmistakable, panelists noted signs that Mamdani might navigate city politics with a mix of conviction and compromise.\n\u201cHe sort of plays the \u2018I didn\u2019t realize how complex it was gonna be\u2019 card very often, and with that, he says, \u2018I\u2019ll be more pragmatic now,\u2019\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. We\u2019ll find out shortly, but he is learning very quickly that there\u2019s a ton of powerful constituencies that have a real voice, and when they speak, you have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One year later, sweeping changes to New York City\u2019s zoning rules are shaping the trajectory of housing projects.\nDevelopers are moving forward with plans for larger residential buildings. Air rights deals are\nheating up\n. Homeowners are moving forward with adding so-called granny flats.\nFriday is the\none-year anniversary\nof the City Council\u2019s\npassage\nof the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a text amendment that eliminated parking mandates from some parts of the city, legalized accessory dwelling units, created new high-density residential districts, expanded what office buildings can be converted to residential and\nmuch more\n.\nIn recognition of the one-year mark, the Department of City Planning on Friday released a few stats on the progress of the text amendment.\nCity of Yes created the Universal Affordability Preference program, which\nreplaced\nthe city\u2019s Voluntary Inclusionary Housing program. The program provides a 20 percent density bonus to projects if the extra space is dedicated to permanently affordable housing, which must, on average, be affordable to those earning 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe city released applications for UAP in April, and has since received applications for more than 100 housing developments, according to City Planning. The agency would not provide details on these properties, but indicated that the projects are expected to net 5,400 new homes, of which 900 would be affordable.\nCity of Yes also\nmade it easier\nto transfer air rights from landmarked buildings and freed some of these transactions from the city\u2019s land-use review process (transfers that would increase the height of a project by more than 25 percent still need a special permit, though).\nThe changes have spurred more of these deals than in previous years. Five buildings have since sought approval for such air rights transfers, which would result in 400,000 square feet of new development, according to City Planning. By comparison, the city received only 15 applications for this kind of transfer over the last 50 years.\nSince launching applications for accessory dwelling units in September, 98 homeowners in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island have applied.\nCity of Yes also created two new residential zoning districts, known as R11 and R12. In such districts (which must be applied through a rezoning), buildings can be 15 or 18 times the size of the lot where they are constructed, referred to as having a floor area ratio of 15 or 18.\nThese districts have only been mapped once so far, as part of the\nMidtown South\nrezoning. The districts have been proposed at two individual sites:\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\nin Downtown Brooklyn and\na site above\nthe Second Avenue subway extension.\nOfficials projected that City of Yes would add 80,000 housing units over the next 15 years. Whether that comes to fruition will depend on myriad factors, including to what extent future administrations and City Council members support development.\nSome in the industry think the current Council might stifle construction if it passes\nfour bills\nthat would set new rules for affordable housing production in the city. Developers have also argued that construction wage rules attached to the property tax break 485x will lead to less housing, and stunt the impact of City of Yes, as well as the housing ballot measures that voters approved in November.\n",

        "content": "As the Chicago area multifamily scene keeps heating up, midmarket dealmakers are finding a sweet spot in the city.\nA trio of recent sales on the North and West sides of the city indicates that both local and out-of-state buyers are taking interest in Chicago\u2019s inventory of midsized apartment buildings.\nAt 501 West Deming Place in Lincoln Park, the estate of John A. Brown sold the deceased investor\u2019s 56-unit building for $19.4 million last month. The buyers were a joint venture led by Chicago-based Hayes Properties.\nBrown was a longtime owner of the property and last refinanced it for $11.5 million in 2016. The recent $19.4 million sale price came out to about $346,000 per unit, though two groundfloor retail spaces somewhat skew the price per unit.\n\u201cThis generational location garnered a lot of buyer interest from both institutional firms and families which allowed us to achieve an above-ask purchase price with a solid buyer,\u201d Interra Realty Broker Colin O\u2019Malley said.\nBrown earlier this year also sold a long-vacant Gold Coast building. The property, which Brown had planned to convert to condos at one point, sold to Chicago-based developer\nAltitude Capital for $10 million\n.\nWhile highrises have to compete for sparse institutional capital, midmarket properties are garnering interest from buyers who can tap into alternative sources of funding.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding not only through our capital markets group, but also our clients, that in the midmarket space, financing is not a problem \u2026 from the small regional or local lenders all the way up to the national lenders,\u201d said Essex Realty broker Jim Darrow. \u201cThey want to lend in Chicago and they want to lend on good, well-located assets.\u201d\nDarrow recently arranged a $15.7 million sale on behalf of Chicago developers Frank Campise and Jim Jann of\nJAB Real Estate\n, which completed a development play with the deal.\nJAB bought a development site at 1553 North Wells Street in Old Town in 2017 and built a 23-unit apartment building with one ground-floor retail space. The retail component is currently occupied by national coffee chain Philz Coffee.\nGround-up development is rare in Old Town, where much of the area is already built out and older buildings still carry high replacement costs, Darrow said.\n\u201cThese older, vintage-type buildings, they\u2019re worth a lot of money,\u201d Darrow said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to tear them down and build new construction.\u201d\nThe JAB property got interest from local and out of state buyers and ultimately sold to San Francisco-based Epp Properties. The sale came out to roughly $682,000 per unit.\nFurther northwest in the city, developer\nNoah Properties\nsold Block Belmont, a midsize building in Belmont Cragin, to local investor Terezia Covaci for $18.5 million.\nNoah, which is led by husband-and-wife duo Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek, bought the development site in 2020 for $750,000 with a $525,000 loan from Belmont Bank and Trust.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how much the developers put into the construction of the apartment building, but they initially took out a $9.7 million construction loan from Parkview Financial and later refinanced the property with a $13 million loan from GreenState Credit Union in 2023.\n",

        "content": "When Vickey Barron\u2019s client, a 27-year-old working in finance, heard what his bonus was going to be last year, he went on a \u201cshopping spree.\u201d\n\u201cI would imagine it feels like, \u2018Oh, I just won the lottery,\u2019\u201d said Barron, a veteran Compass agent. \u201c[They were] fixated on buying. It wasn\u2019t a question, it was: \u2018let\u2019s find the right property.\u2019\u201d\nThey ended up with a Chelsea condo for just under $5 million.\nBarron\u2019s client is one of many finance workers in the city with a winning lottery ticket in the form of a big year-end bonus. The city\u2019s biggest firms have turned in some of their best trading years in history, and New York City brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nthat cash flow has inspired a slew of buyers.\nBusiness hawks strategized and spent to prevent Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor, but the city\u2019s\nluxury market hasn\u2019t skipped a beat following his election\nand the doomsday predictions that came with it.\nBut the timing makes sense: Wall Street bonuses are expected to bounce back this year after a lull, with one\nforecast projecting a rise to their highest level in four years\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with a lot of finance people right now that are, I think, feeling very bullish,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen.\nBonuses in the securities industry rose 34 percent to a record $47.5 billion in 2024, according to a\nreport\nfrom the state comptroller\u2019s office. Trading firms like Jane Street Capital in particular rode booming equities markets to\nrecord trading profits\nlast year, with many companies on pace to do the same in 2025.\nEmployees at these firms, who often pay interns six-figure salaries, can earn millions in bonuses alone. In 2024, Jane Street gave out over\n$2.4 billion in bonuses\n, an average of $900,000 per employee.\nBarron said she has two more clients who work for Jane Street looking for Downtown Manhattan homes in the $5 million range after renting what \u201cyou would rent right out of college\u201d for the last year.\n\u201cThey could have afforded far more than what they were renting, but I think they honestly were just working so hard that they just needed a bed to sleep in,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now, of course, they\u2019re out shopping to buy because it paid off.\u201d\nWhile the first-time buyers splurging on their first apartments have been pumping the $5 million-plus market, industry veterans have been trading some of the city\u2019s trophy properties as well this year.\nEarlier this year, a financier was behind a Downtown Manhattan record. Harsh Padia, CEO of trading firm HAP Capital, sold his\nduplex at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles Street for $60 million\n. The buyer was\nreportedly\nfrom Jane Street Capital, which has its office just minutes away down the West Side Highway.\nCompass\u2019 Zeve Salman, who represented the buyer on that deal, said he\u2019s working with at least a dozen other buyers looking for homes over $30 million and only sees prices going up.\n\u201cI would almost guarantee you\u2019ll see more records broken before the end of the year, and that is all post-election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers that we\u2019re discussing with people, the type of properties that we were discussing \u2014 it\u2019s the exact same caliber, and it\u2019s still all local people.\u201d\nLuxury sales in the city have been particularly strong in recent months, after a spring market bogged down by economic and geopolitical uncertainty. In November, contracts signed in Manhattan for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent year-over-year, according to a report from Miller Samuel. And in Brooklyn, the borough has seen contract volume crack $100 million in each of the last two months, a rarity for the borough.\n\u201cThere were not enough buyers actively looking last spring, and it\u2019s been night and day to this fall,\u201d said Compass Kallie Catt, who has put four homes into contract in the last several weeks, including a Dumbo condo asking $5.5 million.\nBuyers who have profited from the stock market in the last few years may have another motivation to buy real estate in the city \u2014 getting out of the market.\nCorcoran\u2019s Ryan Kaplan said many of his clients in finance \u201cfeel that the market is objectively frothy.\u201d\n\u201cThings are very rosy for these kinds of people, financially speaking,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably why we\u2019re starting to see them deploying capital.\u201d\nDespite the money flowing into the market, Kaplan said buyers \u2014 especially the fiscally savvy ones \u2014 are still wary about getting a good deal. \u201cThere is this sense of opportunism,\u201d he said, where buyers know that inflation is still high, debt is still expensive and the presidential and mayoral elections have ruffled some feathers.\nThat maneuvering has meant\nsellers getting realistic with pricing\nhas been just as important for the market this fall, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Michelle Griffith. \u201cIf buyers wanted to come into the market earlier this year, the sellers weren\u2019t as flexible,\u201d she said.\nBut desperate buyers trying to fearmonger their way into a discount after the election may still be out of luck, according to Salman.\n[\u201cAgents will] come to a $10 million listing and it\u2019ll be like, \u2018Well, you know, the election \u2014 so he really thinks it\u2019s worth $9 million,\u2019\u201d Salman said.\nBut, for now at least, \u201cthose same properties end up selling close to their asking price,\u201d he added.\n",

        "content": "Beyond Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s interests in connecting with princes, former presidents and financial heavyweights, the\nlate, disgraced\nfinancier sometimes extended his attention to commercial real estate.\nAmong the more than 20,000 documents obtained by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from Epstein\u2019s estate and released to the public in November were emails with links to\nThe Real Deal\narticles and what appears to be a saved or printed\nTRD\nweb story from June 2019. The emails and\nTRD\narticles touched on a Palm Beach development deal, a members-only club and a dealmaker who faced tax issues.\nThe documents shed some light on Epstein\u2019s Rolodex of business contacts at a time when the source of his wealth still remains somewhat of a mystery. At the time of his death in August 2019, Epstein\u2019s net worth was close to $600 million, which was largely thanks to two clients, Les Wexner and Leon Black. Epstein was the money manager to billionaire L Brands founder Wexner and he provided tax and estate planning services to Black, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management.\nBut Epstein appears to have had a keen interest in real estate more generally.\nA review of the documents shows he was also at least nominally interested in one Palm Beach development deal. In another email, he claims to have put the founders of a popular members-only club with a location in New York City \u201cin business.\u201d One email refers to a\nTRD\narticle about a case brought against a New York developer for tax evasion. Others provide insight into Epstein\u2019s partnership with New York real estate heavyweight Andrew Farkas on a small marina in the British Virgin Islands.\nOpaque real estate connections\nEpstein had owned ultra-luxury homes, but most reporting has not suggested that he was looking at commercial projects. His own property included a mansion in Palm Beach, a townhouse in Manhattan, an estate in New Mexico and, most notably, two private islands in the Virgin Islands where his victims were allegedly sexually abused.\nThough his brother, Mark Epstein, ran a New York real estate firm called Ossa Properties, Mark consistently maintained Jeffrey was not involved. After Ossa acquired a number of condo units in a building at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, Mark told Crain\u2019s in 2019 that his brother was renting apartments there, and that he had acquired the building in the early \u201990s based on a tip from Jeffrey. He added that his brother was not his business partner and his brother\u2019s investment firm, J. Epstein &amp; Co., had no connection to Ossa Properties, despite public filings showing otherwise.\nBut Jonathan Barrett, who worked at Ossa Properties, told the Wall Street Journal in 2019 through a spokesperson that Ossa and J. Epstein &amp; Co. were indeed affiliated.\nJonathan Barrett\u2019s brother Anthony appears to be the point person in recent years at Ossa Properties and has signed for an affiliate of the company in public documents recorded with the city. (Ossa Properties did not return a request to comment.)\nNew details\nEmails released by Congress show that Anthony Barrett at least considered Jeffrey Epstein a possible buyer of commercial real estate in Palm Beach.\nAmong the large batch of documents is an email from Barrett to Epstein in October 2018. In the email, with the subject line \u201cDeal info,\u201d Barrett sent Epstein the text of a recent\nTRD\narticle about the Palm House hotel in Palm Beach, which was heading to a bankruptcy sale.\nAnthony Barrett: Hi jeffrey,\nCam across this\u2026perhaps you have some interest?\nEpstein responded: \u201cfunn, but quite a mess.\u201d\nFederal prosecutors had accused the previous developer of the Palm House Hotel of siphoning millions of dollars in foreign investors\u2019 money. The investors, who put in more than $44 million as part of the federal EB-5 program, filed their own lawsuit, alleging the development group falsely touted that the hotel\u2019s advisory board would include Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and Celine Dion, Bill Koch and Tony Bennett were already members at the hotel\u2019s club.\nEpstein, who had a house about a mile away in Palm Beach, apparently had some interest in the story.\nAmong the other documents provided by the Epstein estate and released by Congress was a digital version of a more\nin-depth article\nabout the saga of the Palm House hotel that\nTRD\npublished in June 2019. The document shows the story was saved a week after\nTRD\npublished the story.\nJust one month later, in July 2019, Epstein was arrested in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking. Prosecutors alleged Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls. In August, Epstein died by suicide while awaiting charges in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.\nThere were other emails discussing news articles about various real estate happenings. In an April 2018 email, Richard Kahn, Epstein\u2019s accountant, sent Epstein a\nTRD\narticle about Michael Shvo\u2019s recent settlement of his tax evasion case with the Manhattan District Attorney.\nKahn: \u201cdirection of trump? criminal tax fraud??\u201d\nEpstein responded: \u201cCareful. Max might call.\u201d\nIt is not clear who Max is or why Kahn should be careful.\nThe documents\nalso showed\nemails between Epstein and Core Club\u2019s co-founder Jennie Enterprise. Core Club, a members-only club popular with the ultra-rich and hedge funders, opened its doors in 2005 at East 55th Street.\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d Epstein wrote in a personal message to an unknown recipient in 2018, referring to Core Club\u2019s co-founders.\nCore Club, through a spokesperson, refuted the idea of Epstein\u2019s involvement.\n\u201c[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d the spokesperson said to\nTRD\nin an email.\n",

        "content": "A historic piece of Houston\u2019s skyline has dodged the auction block \u2014 at least for now.\nThe owner of the long-vacant Exxon-Mobil tower at 800 Bell Street wired more than $16 million in a last-minute payoff that halted a Dec. 2 foreclosure sale, resetting the clock on a troubled saga that\u2019s dragged through loan disputes, bankruptcy filings and a stalled redevelopment plan, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The reprieve doesn\u2019t solve the tower\u2019s structural and financial headaches, but it keeps a potential $35 million sale on the table, according to court records.\nChicago-based Sugar Pine Development has been circling the 45-story property and was expected to close on a deal by Dec. 5, though as of earlier this week it hadn\u2019t filed anything signaling it had backed away. The firm has begun assembling a redevelopment team, the filings show.\nThe 1.2 million-square-foot building \u2014 once the headquarters of Humble Oil, a predecessor to ExxonMobil \u2014 has been vacant since Exxon left for its Spring campus in 2015.\nThe tower\u2019s owner,\nBell Business Investments\n\u2014 an affiliate of New York\u2019s\nCMI Developers\n\u2014 is keeping its options open. A principal for the firm, Isaac Jacobowitz, told the outlet that they will either form the right team to revitalize the building or sell for a reasonable price. Asked whether a sale to Sugar Pine was imminent, he said both that deal and another buyer remain possible.\nThe legal fallout traces back to Bell Business\u2019 failed attempt to convert the 1960s-era office tower into a residential-heavy mixed-use complex. Its original lender\nsold the loan\nto an entity called 800 Bell Holdings, which declared a default in July and pushed for foreclosure this fall. Bell Business fought the claims, filing for bankruptcy in October to stall the sale, then withdrawing the case weeks later to pursue a transaction. When the sale didn\u2019t materialize, 800 Bell Holdings took another run at foreclosure.\nThe payoff \u2014 funded through a $13 million refinancing from Broadview Capital that matures in January 2027 \u2014 gives Bell Business roughly a year to land a buyer or revive a redevelopment plan. But the building\u2019s condition remains a major hurdle. Court filings describe water damage, broken windows, moldy drywall and moisture intrusion. A Harris County judge granted the lender access to perform emergency repairs, and its attorney said 40 workers completed roughly $380,000 worth of fixes. Questions about asbestos remediation linger, according to the journal.\nDowntown Houston\u2019s cadre of aging megatowers has proven tough to reposition even with interest from opportunistic buyers, and the\nExxon-Mobil\nbuilding is no exception.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Day, the company announced Friday.\nSL Green now owns 100 percent of the 750,000-square-foot property.

At\n845 Third Avenue\n, Rudin is turning the building into 411 units.\nThose projects, along with others in Midtown, have taken supply off the market and helped to improve conditions for the remaining office properties in the area.\nCurrent tenants at 800 Third include investment advisor Kimelman &amp; Baird, management firm Renaissance Technologies and law office Kobre &amp; Kim. Asking rent for a lease last January was in the mid-$70s per square foot, according to the Commercial Observer.\nSL Green acquired a stake in 800 Third Avenue in 2006, when it created a partnership with owners Joseph P. Day Realty Corp. and the estate of Norman Levy. That initial investment, valued at $102.4 million, came in the form of a loan secured by a 47 percent interest in the building. SL Green had the option to convert the mortgage into equity.\n",

        "content": "Greystar and Artemis Real Estate Partners bought a 220-unit age-restricted apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for $69.4 million.\nCharleston, South Carolina-based Greystar and Chevy Chase, Maryland-based Artemis bought the Everleigh Palm Beach Gardens at 3660 RCA Boulevard from United Group of Companies and Sina Companies, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyers borrowed $50.1 million from PGIM Real Estate. The price amounts to $315,455 per unit.\nTroy, New York-based United Group and Palm Beach Gardens-based Sina developed the complex, consisting of a pair of L-shaped buildings, in 2021, records show. It was developed on the 10.7-acre site of the Amara Shrine Center on RCA Boulevard, a fraternal organization.\nEverleigh consists of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments for tenants 55 and older, according to the community\u2019s website.\nApartments.com shows monthly rents range from $2,764 to $6,910, with Everleigh\u2019s website showing that tenants could get up to two months free for base rent.\nLed by Bob Faith, Greystar is an investment, development and management firm focusing on multifamily, including student and senior housing, and logistics properties, according to its website. It manages about 1.1 million multifamily units, and has roughly $79 billion of assets under management and $36 billion worth of development projects.\nIn January, it sold the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens apartment complex at 4310 Chukka Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County to Property Reserve, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate arm, for\n$102.4 million\n. Greystar then bought the 358-unit Avana at the Moors complex at 6200 Northwest 173rd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County for\n$93.5 million\n.\nIn May, Greystar picked up a 36-acre industrial development site approved for three warehouses at the corner of Lyons Road and Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek for\n$30.5 million\n.\nArtemis, an investment manager that\u2019s purchased more than $16 billion of real estate, was set to be\nacquired\nby Charlotte, North Carolina-based Barings in the first quarter of this year, according to its website. Financial terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed.\nThe Sunshine State has been a magnet for retirees for years, with South Florida senior housing generally enjoying continuing demand. (These communities offer independent, active living, which is different from facilities offering assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing.)\nInvestors and developers have taken note.\nIn January, AEW Capital Management bought the 424-unit senior living Welling Bay complex at\u00a0 2590 Wellington Bay Drive in Wellington for\n$100.1 million\n. Last year, Walton Street Capital bought the 136-unit Alamar Senior Living community at 8785 Lake Worth Road in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$23.5 million\n.\nDeveloper Lewis Swezy\u2019s Centennial Management plans an\n80-unit\nage-restricted rental building at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue, near Miami-Dade County\u2019s Earlington Heights Metrorail stop. The project will be for tenants 55 and older and earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income.\u00a0In January, Pinnacle proposed a\n110-unit\naffordable apartment project on the southeast corner of South Dixie Highway and Southwest 250th Street in Miami-Dade\u2019s Princeton neighborhood.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio Spurs legend and pro basketball hall of famer Tony Parker has cut the asking price of his Central Texas villa as its\nunusual marketing strategy\nfaces the test of a buyer\u2019s market.\nIn a bid to become \u201cthe most-talked about estate in America,\u201d as its listing website claims, the NBA star\u2019s home\nfamously hosted web celebrity Kai Cenat\nfor a month over the summer before going on the public market. Parker\u2019s agent, Houston broker Erwin Nicholas II, conceived of the marketing scheme after Cenat approached him to find a rental mansion for his act to use for a month-long performance event. Nicholas has since applied the same strategy to\nJeff Greene\u2019s Beverly Hills estate\nand its $195 million price tag.\nParker\u2019s home listed publicly in September for $20 million, and the price dropped on Saturday to $19.5 million, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nLike Greene\u2019s property,\nwhich was once the most expensive public listing in America\n, Parker\u2019s home has struggled to sell in the past. Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Binkan Cinaroglu, one of San Antonio\u2019s top luxury agents, represented the home previously.\nThe challenges continue.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we represent the opportunity to negotiate,\u201d Nicholas said of the price cut.\nParker launched his gambit during a downturn for Texas sellers, even in the luxury tier. In September,\nseven of the top 10 most expensive homes for sale in the state were relistings\n, representing an increasingly stagnant market compared to earlier months in 2025. In Central Texas, the San Antonio and Austin metro areas\nled the nation in canceled deals and home value loss\n, respectively, at different points in the year. Meanwhile,\nhome supply is rivaling post-recession levels\nthroughout the Texas Triangle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market right now. There\u2019s a lot of inventory, so something has to happen,\u201d Nicholas said when asked about predictions for 2026.\nLuxury custom properties such as Parker\u2019s \u2014 which features what marketing materials call a water park,\u201d among other amenities \u2014 tend to take longer to sell than more conventional luxury homes at the same price point, according to Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz, who specializes in selling ranches. As a result, it\u2019s difficult to assess yet whether Parker\u2019s lengthening number of days on market suggests that it\u2019s going stale.\n\u201cThere really is no one-size-fits-all. That said, if we list a unique property \u2026 we expect to complete a campaign for something unique and unusual in really no more than nine months,\u201d Uechtritz said.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be very hard to write a one-size-fits-all kind of opinion on days on the market. I mean, if something is there for a year or two, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Integra Solutions wants to take on one of Miami-Dade\u2019s\nbiggest public housing overhauls\n, proposing a $385.9 million redevelopment that would quintuple density on a 12-acre Brownsville site while layering in a wide spread of income-restricted units.\nThe Miami-based developer is asking the county for a 99-year ground lease and master development agreement to raze and rebuild the aging Annie Coleman 15 complex with 905 apartments, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. The proposal heads to the county\u2019s Housing Committee next week.\nThe site, at 2200 and 2501 N.W. 57th Street, holds 144 public housing units built in 1965. Integra also has a small adjacent parcel under contract, which it aims to fold into the plan.\nMiami-Dade began shopping the property in 2023 as part of a broader push to modernize its public housing stock. These deals typically blend replacement public housing with deeper affordability and workforce units, but they require federal approval, adding time and complexity.\nIntegra estimates construction at $270.1 million, spread across three phases. The public housing delivered would allow all of the existing tenants to stay in place.\nThe unit mix is broad for a single site: 495 one-bedrooms, 187 two-bedrooms, 158 three-bedrooms and 65 four-bedroom townhomes. Income levels would range from extremely low-income to workforce, including 182 units at 30 percent of area median income, 270 at 60 percent, 272 at 80 percent and 181 at 120 percent.\nIntegra is padding the proposal with perks, including a fitness center, playground, 20 for-sale homes, a youth art center, 3,100 square feet of commercial space, an on-site police workstation, a 5 percent cut of developer fees for the Brownsville Civic Neighborhood Association and 10 percent of net cash flow for a local public art endowment.\nIntegra\u2019s principals \u2014 Victor Ballestas, Paulo Henrique Tavares de Melo, Jacob Conrad Morrow and Nelson Stabile \u2014 are expected to pursue state financing next year through the Florida Housing Finance Corp. The company could not be reached for comment.\nIf the proposal advances, the County Commission would vote in January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant corner of Glenview\u2019s office market is back in a developer\u2019s sight, with a local industrial player testing whether the suburb that has already absorbed one massive workspace-to-warehouse remake is willing to greenlight another.\nFormer Sterling Bay industrial chief Scott Gibbel plans to present his vision Dec. 10 to Glenview\u2019s New Development Commission to replace the mostly empty Caremark Towers with nearly 400,000 square feet of new warehouses, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. His newly launched firm,\nCurtis Ashton Partners\n, wants to level the two aging office buildings at 2211 Sanders Road and build a 29-acre, 395,000-square-foot industrial park dubbed O\u2019Hare Park 294, according to a village filing.\nThe concept mirrors \u2014 and expands on \u2014 a proposal Dermody Properties\nfloated in 2023\nfor a 300,000-square-foot complex on the same site. Dermody, the developer behind the industrial takeover of the 232-acre former Allstate campus just to the south, won commission approval but never secured a rezoning from the village board,\nThe Real Deal\nreported at the time. Rising interest rates killed Dermody\u2019s plan by year\u2019s end.\nGibbel\u2019s goes bigger by tacking on a vacant parcel along Interstate 294 that he aims to buy from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. His team says the project would serve \u201cshallow bay\u201d users \u2014 light manufacturers and R&amp;D tenants \u2014 who have been boxed out as developers chase bulk\nwarehouse demand\n. He hopes to start demolition this spring and deliver all three buildings by summer 2027, building on spec.\nStill, the market around him isn\u2019t exactly roaring. Dermody has struggled to fill portions of its Logistics Campus, envisioned at 3.2 million square feet at full buildout. And while Glenview planners liked the 2023 version of the Caremark plan, a core group of Mission Hills residents didn\u2019t. They\u2019re now reviving their opposition with an online petition ahead of next month\u2019s hearing on the Gibbel proposal.\nCaremark Towers\u2019\nfractured ownership\ndoesn\u2019t simplify matters. DTS Properties bought the taller building at 2211 Sanders Road for $2.3 million in 2022, while the Farbman Group picked up its neighbor at 2215 Sanders for $2.2 million. None of the owners or Gibbel are talking publicly.\nThe proposal reopens familiar fault lines for Glenview residents, as the village has watched residents push back on major redevelopment bids before, from a Core Spaces single-family rental plan to an apartment conversion of the nearby Renaissance hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Align Real Estate\u2019s plan to\nturn three Safeway sites\nacross San Francisco into housing is facing early opposition.\nThe local firm filed plans to develop a 25-story waterfront apartment complex on the site of a grocery store at 15 Marina Boulevard, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. But the project is already facing pushback from Mayor Daniel Lurie and\nridicule\nfrom Marina district residents.\nLurie\u2019s Family Zoning\nplan was approved this week, but Align filed its plans before that, using lenient state height guidelines for the 790-unit proposal. Lurie\u2019s plan allows heights of 140 to 350 feet in districts where it wants to encourage housing density but limits other areas to 65 to 85 feet.\nAlign\u2019s timing caught the attention of the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cA developer trying to sneak in a project before our plan takes effect is a complete violation of the spirit of that work,\u201d Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for Lurie, said. \u201cOur administration will stand up firmly to developers that game the system, and we will pull every lever we can to make this a project that works for this neighborhood and our city.\u201d\nAlign\u2019s plan for the 2.6-acre site includes 86 affordable units. The project would consist of two towers connected by a U-shaped center, rising 250 feet at its highest. It\u2019s a decrease in height from Align\u2019s original plans, which Lurie also opposed.\nThe development would reserve 63,000 square feet for a replacement Safeway, an increase from the existing store\u2019s 40,520 square feet. The development would have 473 residential parking spaces and 164 for the grocery store.\nLurie isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s opposed to the project; the neighborhood\u2019s supervisor, Stephen Sherrill, also intends to fight it.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it go unchallenged,\u201d Sherrill told the outlet. \u201cOur neighborhoods deserve stability and real rules \u2014 not to be blindsided by cartoonish mega-projects trying to exploit loopholes in state law.\u201d\nWhile the developer is not currently bound by the city\u2019s height and density limits at the site, the Family Zoning plan will target the Marina location in an attempt to shave down the project.\nAlign\u2019s other proposals call for similar transformation of Safeway sites into mixed-use towers. Those plans, revealed over the past month, include more than\n1,800 units at 1335 Webster Street\nin the Fillmore District, 526 units for the Safeway at 850 La Playa Street in the Outer Richmond and 370 units at the Safeway property at 3350 Mission Street in\nBernal Heights\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Gehry\n, the architect behind some of the most recognizable commercial structures around the world, has died.\nThe architecture giant died at his home in Santa Monica, California at the age of 96, the New York Times\nreported\n. He was battling a brief respiratory illness prior to his death.\nGehry leaves behind a legacy of envisioning lively structures often characterized by undulating, silver accents, including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the New World Center concert hall in Miami Beach, the\n8 Spruce Street residential tower\nin New York City and the Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris.\nGehry was born in 1929 and raised in Toronto before moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1947. He studied architecture at the University of Southern California, graduating in 1954, and enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly thereafter. With the help of the G.I. Bill, he went on to study city planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.\nArmed with an education and passion for architecture, Gehry worked as a designer and project manager at Gruen Associates, a firm known for its shopping malls. He opened his own office in 1962 and spent much of his early career working for mainstream developers. Eventually, however, he developed his own style, wanting to buck many of the building trends of the time \u2014 something likely birthed out of being introduced to the work of Modernist pioneer Raphael Soriano during his studies.\n\u201cI was rebelling against everything,\u201d he told the Times in 2012.\nGehry became a household name \u2014 literally \u2014 nearly half a century ago with the construction of a home at 1002 22nd Street in\nSanta Monica\nthat he designed and lived in for four decades. He earned the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989 and left his mark around the globe with projects that include the Dancing House in Prague; the Biomuseo in Panama City; Maison Hennessy in Cognac, France; the Pierre Boulez Saal concert hall in Berlin; and the Louis Vuitton flagship store in\nSeoul\n. He was also one of the first architects to embrace computer design, and that tech pedigree synced up with Facebook when he designed its West Campus in Menlo Park, California.\nGehry is survived by his wife Berta Aguilera and their two sons, architectural designer Sam and artist Alejandro, as well as his daughter Brina Gehry from his previous marriage and his sister Doreen Gehry Nelson.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

In exchange for increased density, the developer will be required to designate 21 apartments for very low-income households, or individuals\nmaking\na maximum of $53,000 annually and households of four making $75,750.\nThe offices were formerly the headquarters of animation studio Filmation. It\u2019s been vacant for decades, following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Seismic retrofitting for the property was determined to be too expensive.\nToll Brothers\u2019 presence in the multifamily market is evolving. In September, Kennedy Wilson\nacquired Toll Brothers\u2019 Apartment Living\narm for $347 million. Kennedy Wilson secured Toll Brothers\u2019 general partner interests in 18 multifamily and student housing assets worth approximately $2.2 billion, as well as a 29-property development pipeline worth approximately $3.6 billion of investment.\nThe Canoga Avenue project isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in the works in Warner Center. In September, Meta Housing Corporation\nsubmitted an application\nto build affordable apartments for senior citizens at 21010 Vanowen Street. That proposal similarly calls for demolishing a one-story office building and accompanying parking lot to make way for a six-story building boasting 395 apartments for low- and moderate-income households.\nEarlier this year, billionaire developer and Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke\nunveiled plans\nto build a 100-acre team headquarters, residential and retail entertainment hub in Warner Center. That project, dubbed Rams Village at Warner Center, is expected to boost foot traffic and density at the master-planned business district in Canoga Park and Woodland Hills.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

City Council approved $2.2 million in sales tax incentives for the project, which is being developed by Gillum Development and Seal Family Properties.\nDeputy City Manager Jordan Matney told council the project \u201cmost likely not moved forward\u201d without the boost from the city, the outlet reported. The incentives package will provide a $700,000 reimbursement for public improvements and $1.5 million for the developer after the project receives its certificate of occupancy. The city estimates the project will provide a $1.58 million net benefit to the city over a decade.\nThe four-story project will rise at 699 West San Antonio Street, which is currently home to an 18,000-square-foot retail and warehouse building built in the 1950s. The Neue will feature 43 condo units and about 5,000 square feet of ground-level retail and office space.\nNew Braunfels is about 33 miles northeast of San Antonio. It\u2019s known for its German heritage. It draws visitors who like to tube or float along the Comal and Guadalupe rivers. Like other towns in the region between Austin and San Antonio, New Braunfels\u2019 population is growing rapidly. Since 2000, its\npopulation has surged\nfrom 38,000 to more than 100,000 people.\nThe development of The Neue speaks to\nTexas\u2019 burgeoning condo market\n. Unlike cities like New York and Miami, the Lone Star State doesn\u2019t have many condo buildings, as luxury buyers have traditionally favored the ranch.\nDevelopers in the Houston area are testing the waters. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing the\nstate\u2019s first standalone Ritz-Carlton condo building\nin The Woodlands. When construction started on the 111-unit project, 69 percent of the units were pre-sold. Since the Ritz was announced, Sunny Bathija\u2019s Satya shared plans to develop a standalone St. Regis condo tower in Houston\u2019s Rice/Military neighborhood, and Deiso Moss announced it\u2019s building a\nRitz-Carlton condo tower and hotel\nin Uptown/Galleria.\n\u2013 Jess Hardin\n",

        "content": "In New York City, millions of New Yorkers apply to the Housing Preservation and Development for the slim odds of scoring an affordable apartment.\nBut those odds are still better than those for rent-stabilized buildings applying to HPD for financial relief. In November, HPD deferred every application for an Article XI property tax exemption under its Housing Preservation Opportunity program until February, citing project capacity, according to an e-mail exchange shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The agency said in the email exchange that it received over 75 applications in the fall and will select a limited number of projects in February.\nHPD\u2019s program website states that it has \u201climited staff capacity and a significant backlog of projects. As a result, the assignment of a project manager can take up to one year.\u201d\nAn HPD spokesperson said the agency has not seen a significant increase in applicants over the last few years.\nThe program grants exemptions of up to 40 years on a needs basis for rent-stabilized portfolios with dwindling cash flows. Applicants have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops, like forming a housing development fund corporation, and HPD evaluates projects based on factors like their financials, their level of affordability and vacancy and potential repairs.\nBuildings also agree to other conditions, like keeping all units rent-stabilized, limiting rents and incomes and accepting a homeless set-aside filled from vacancies. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious preservation tool, not a light-touch tax break,\u201d said Belkin Burden Goldman\u2019s David Shamshovich.\nApplicants walk a tricky line. Show too robust an operation, and HPD will likely put its money towards the needier; but show a portfolio on the precipice of foreclosure and HPD might resist throwing good money after bad.\nIn the case of the most recent set of applications, none of those considerations appeared to matter, as they were all stymied by what seems like yet another understaffed city organization.\nShamshovich submitted several applications for the fall term, all of which will now be considered next year. One of them related to a 400-unit portfolio with all rents below the 50 percent area median income that is struggling due to its rising debt service.\nHis team submitted a host of paperwork, including a line-item capital budget showing the building\u2019s need for roughly $1.7 million in near-term work to keep the building up to code.\nHe summed up the state of affairs thusly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for the city, and it saves these buildings and preserves them, but if you don\u2019t have bodies to process them, then they\u2019re essentially unhelpful.\u201d\nAnd despite the building meticulously filing all of the paperwork, the decision has been postponed while the building\u2019s finances continue to suffer.\nThe backlog comes during what has been a nightmarish period for rent-stabilized building owners, who have already had many of the levers to manage their balance sheets pulled out from them with the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.\nWith the soaring costs of insurance, utilities and interest rates alongside a new mayor likely pushing for a rent freeze on rent-stabilized buildings, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Article XI applications only increase going forward.\nThose owners might as well start checking their Powerball numbers instead.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: After reporting that billionaire Larry Ellison bought two apartments from Shari Redstone at the Pierre,\nThe Real Deal\nlearned that the co-op sale was part of the broader Skydance Media and Paramount merger. Now that we have another massive media merger between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see any other house swaps as part of the deal. Know of any homes used as deal sweeteners? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: I had always assumed that avoiding New York taxes was as easy as spending your 183 days elsewhere (Florida, most likely). But this\nNew York Times article\nshed some light on the extent to which the tax auditors will go to catch town-skippers. Auditors caught one fishing enthusiast who said that he was a New York resident to get a $25 discount on his state fishing license (ultimately, he won his case but paid more in legal fees than he saved on the license).\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Stricter safety regulations are coming for cranes, Gothamist\nreported\n. City officials said they are going to begin requiring diesel-powered tower cranes to have fire suppression and detection systems after determining the 2023 Midtown crane collapse was caused by a fire started on the crane\u2019s deck. Crane operators will also need to meet higher qualification requirements.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he will end homeless encampment sweeps, The City\nreported\n. The city spent $6.4 million on the sweeps since 2024; of the 3,500 people who were moved out of encampments, 114 (3 percent) were placed in shelters.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deals recorded Friday were\n1010 East Eighth Street\nin Ocean Parkway and\n1289 Lexington Avenue, 19B\nin Carnegie Hill, both for $8 million. The Ocean Parkway single-family home is 2,600 square feet. The Carnegie Hill condo is 3,500 square feet of new construction.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nJill Bernard has the listing for the condo.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$38.1 million\nfor 26 Bleecker Street.

        "content": "A handful of towers in Sunny Isles Beach are sinking much more than expected, raising questions about whether monitoring settlement should be a requirement across South Florida\u2019s barrier islands.\nThe\nMiami Herald\nexamined dozens of engineering reports covering the majority of the city skyline. Experts told the publication that it\u2019s difficult to determine how much newer towers will settle in Sunny Isles Beach.\nAfter buildings are completed, they typically settle into the ground, but unexpected sinking that\u2019s excessive or uneven can create problems over time. Those issues include cracked pipes and facades, and doors, windows and floors that become uneven.\nFor newer towers under construction in Sunny Isles, which include Dezer Development\u2019s Bentley Residences and the two-tower St. Regis Residences, the foundations can extend up to 20 stories below ground \u2014 200 feet. Dezer secured a\n$630 million construction loan\nfor the project from Madison Realty Capital last month. And Bank OZK boosted the construction financing for Fortune International Group and Ch\u00e2teau Group\u2019s St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to\n$418.3 million\n.\nNone of the experts the newspaper interviewed suggested any immediate concerns of structural or safety issues. But no one is monitoring how towers settle and shift after they are completed and what effect that is having on neighboring buildings.\nNearly three dozen buildings from Miami Beach to Sunny Isles Beach are sinking at \u201cunexpected\u201d rates,\nresearchers found\nin a University of Miami study published a year ago.\nThe buildings identified included the\nFour Seasons Residences\nat the Surf Club in Surfside, and in Sunny Isles, the Porsche Design Tower and Estates at Acqualina. The study relied on satellite images over the seven-year period that used reference points such as building balconies, air conditioning units and boardwalks to measure the buildings\u2019 shifts, and looked at the skyline from 2016 to 2023.\nSubsidence, or sinking, ranging from two to eight centimeters (less than an inch to about three inches) was found, with the most significant effects in Sunny Isles.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "He may not have lived to see his $1 billion-plus vision to\nupgrade the Los Angeles River\ncome to fruition, but architect Frank Gehry was able to shepherd through a transformational plan that is slated to reimagine one of the West Coast\u2019s most underused natural features.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done almost everything you can possibly do as an architect,\u201d Bill Witte, head of Related Companies\u2019 California arm, previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cBut if something successful would emerge from this \u2014 and it looks like it might \u2014 it\u2019s an incredible legacy.\u201d\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Gehry was involved in numerous projects at the time of his\ndeath Friday\nin Santa Monica at the age of 96. A Pritzker Prize-winning architect, Gehry personally designed every project completed by his firm, Gehry Partners.\nThough not the building he will be most remembered for \u2014 which is likely the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain \u2014 Gehry put Los Angeles on the global stage with his innovative Walt Disney Concert Hall. Completed in 2003, the Downtown L.A. cultural destination, home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is notably punctuated by stainless steel sail-like forms. A tourist destination, tours are offered at the site almost daily.\nGehry is also responsible for a myriad of other projects like The Grand LA, Related California\u2019s two-tower, mixed-used development across from the Disney Concert Hall; and Panama City\u2019s Biomuseo.\nA contemporary icon, Gehry was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. He moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947, and\nchanged his name\nto Gehry from Goldberg for professional purposes as he faced anti-Semitism.\nThe architect, known for breaking architectural norms and seeing buildings as sculptures, worked for Victor Gruen Associates while finishing his architecture degree at the University of Southern California.\nHe spent a year in the U.S. army in 1955 before studying urban planning at Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design. He worked briefly at Pereira and Luckman Associates and then rejoined Victor Gruen Associates. He moved to Paris with his family in 1961 and worked with Andr\u00e9 Remondet. Gehry opened Frank O Gehry and Associates in Santa Monica in 1962. Gehry Partners, based in Los Angeles, was formed in 2001.\nOne of his most famous early projects was his personal home at 1002 22nd Street in Santa Monica, in which he lived for four decades. The 1978 home incorporated unconventional materials like chain-link fencing, corrugated metal and plywood. The house became known as Gehry\u2019s earliest Deconstructivist building, though he continued making a number of additions.\nCritics saw Gehry\u2019s\nearly, rough-edged work as combative\n\u2014 Mike Davis famously dubbed it \u201cDirty Harry architecture\u201d \u2014 but Gehry viewed it as a pushback against the elitist pursuit of purity that dominated 20th-century design, according to The New York Times. As digital tools emerged, his architecture grew more sculptural. He said\n\u201carchitecture is art.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Gehry was \u2018good at\u2019 was making architecture that both inspired thought and brought pleasure, making buildings that were unusual enough so that some confused them with art pieces and others found them merely bizarre,\u201d architecture critic Paul wrote in \u201cBuilding Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry,\u201d\nGehry had been working on an 82,000-square-foot flagship store for Louis Vuitton in Beverly Hills, and the conversion of a 1960s building into an exhibition space and events hall in Paris.\nIn New York City, his first building was for Barry Diller, designing IAC\u2019s headquarters at 555 West 18th Street. Goldberger wrote in his biography of Gehry that Diller was wary that Gehry could keep costs down, but the architect prevailed in convincing him that he could \u201cboth be reasonable and produce a building for reasonable cost.\u201d\nGoldberger wrote that Gehry faced a similar challenge at Forest City Ratner\u2019s 8 Spruce Street, which had to be economical, but also compelling: \u201cIt had to be Frank Gehry, but not\ntoo\nFrank Gehry.\u201d\nThe building, known as Beekman Tower and New York by Gehry, was the tallest residential tower in North America when it opened in 2011. Its height, at 870 feet, was not all that drew the eye: Ten thousand steel panels make up the building\u2019s undulating facade, meant to evoke the sculptural lines of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n\u201cWe helped bring to life what was then the most ambitious residential tower ever built in Lower Manhattan \u2014 a building that proved daring architecture and large-scale development could coexist, elevate one another and redefine the skyline,\u201d developer MaryAnne Gilmartin, who was at Forest City Ratner when Gehry designed 8 Spruce Street, said in a statement to\nTRD\n.\nOf course, sometimes cost can interfere with such ethos. Forest City originally hired Gehry as the master planner of the Brooklyn megadevelopment then\nknown as Atlantic Yards\n, but ultimately replaced him in 2009, scrapping his designs for the Barclays Center and a gleaming office tower, dubbed \u201cMiss Brooklyn.\u201d At the time, developer Bruce Ratner\ncited\nan economic downturn, rising construction costs and litigation against the project.\u00a0\u00a0But Gilmartin said Gehry\u2019s work still influenced Brooklyn\u2019s transformation, by reimagining\u00a0 \u201cwhat large, complex urban redevelopment could be: ambitious, integrated and rooted in creating a multi-generational neighborhood.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Ben Ashkenazy just placed a major wager on suburban retail by paying roughly $60\u202fmillion for Orland Park Place southwest of Chicago, cementing its shift in focus from the city\u2019s downtown shopping scene and into the suburbs.\nThe roughly 600,000\u2011square\u2011foot open\u2011air shopping center on 45 acres in Orland Park now belongs to the New York-based investor\u2019s firm Ashkenazy Acquisition, which acquired it from New Orleans-based PMAT Real Estate Investments, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe buyer has spent recent years tangled in turbulence on downtown Chicago\u2019s downtown retail strip only to pivot decisively toward the suburbs. In September, Ashkenazy\u2019s partner\nAurora Capital Associates\nironed out a $98\u202fmillion debt package that was coming due in order to keep control of the 300,000\u2011square\u2011foot retail chunk at 700\u202fNorth Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. While it\u2019s unclear whether Ashkenazy\u2019s ownership stake was changed by the transaction, the firm\u2019s focus in the Chicago area has been transitioning away from the urban core.\nAshkenazy this year raised a\n$750\u202fmillion war chest for acquisitions\n, largely from his own funds with backing from prior investors, to target retail and hospitality assets \u2014 especially those with overleveraged owners forced to sell at steep discounts.\nThat capital may now be deploying into properties like\nOrland Park\n, where a strong tenant roster and affluent suburban catchment area offer a steadier cash\u2011flow story than distressed downtown retail. Ashkenazy also purchased a retail property on\nChicago\u2019s Far North Side\nnear Evanston in 2023 for $22 million.\nOrland Park Place\u2019s mix of national retailers, discounters and steady foot traffic stands in contrast to the volatility that\u2019s plagued large downtown retail landlords, many of whom have wrestled with tenant departure, loan defaults or writing off underperforming assets.\nFor Ashkenazy, the purchase may signal a recalibrated retail thesis: rather than double down on vertical retail in a troubled downtown \u2014 where the firm already\ndefaulted on a $61\u202fmillion loan\ntied to another Magnificent Mile asset in 2024 \u2014 it is quietly building a suburban platform anchored by stable shopping centers.\nPMAT initially purchased Orland Park Place for $74.6 million in March 2024, based on Cook County property records. Because the recent sale to Ashkenazy, as reported by the seller\u2019s broker Mid-America Real Estate, did not encompass the outlots on LaGrange Road, the final price is estimated to be similar to what PMAT paid for the specific area included in the transaction, the outlet reported.\n\u2014Sam Lounsberry\n",

The buyer plans to hold the property for five years, aligning with its ongoing acquisition strategy, said Greg Campbell, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer.\nBenedict Canyon Equities previously purchased the 108-unit Hayden at Martinez apartments in Martinez. It also owns properties in the Sacramento area, including the Fairmont Apartments in Woodland, which it bought last December for $41 million.\nThe acquisition of the Vue Fremont complex marks Benedict Canyon\u2019s first foray into the East Bay, with more acquisitions in the East Bay and South Bay planned for next year.\nThe multifamily property is the latest to trade hands in Fremont.\nIn July, the Metro Fremont apartments at 4444 Hansen Avenue sold for $33 million.

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities\nbought 5.7 acres in San Ramon for about $30.5 million, a year and a half after winning multifamily development entitlements for the site, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. Sunset Development Company, the developer of the Bishop Ranch master-planned community, was the seller.\nThe price amounts to $5.35 million per acre.\nVirginia-based AvalonBay plans to build a 456-unit housing development known as Avalon San Ramon. The project, at 6200 Bollinger Canyon Road, will have five- and seven-story buildings connected by a breezeway, plus a rooftop deck, fitness center, pool and pet spa.\nConstruction is expected to begin by the end of this month, with the goal to open for residents by 2027. Sunset Development and AvalonBay\nreceived approval\nfor the project last year.\nWhile Bishop Ranch has seen several housing developments take shape in recent years, Avalon San Ramon will be one of the few to rise on vacant land.\nThe project is one of several in the works at Bishop Ranch. The City of San Ramon approved the first-ever 100 percent affordable housing project at Bishop Ranch in October. That\nproject from Eden Housing\ncalls for building 200 units on a 2.2-acre site at 2453 Camino Ramon, currently home to a 10,000-square-foot service center.\nMeanwhile, Sunset Development Company has some housing projects of its own in the works at Bishop Ranch. The owner and developer\nplans to demolish\n761,000 square feet of office space to make way for two residential communities.\nThat project requires the razing of the three-building, 652,000-square-foot Canopy office complex at 3000-5000 Executive Parkway and replacing it with a 412-unit residential community of 255 detached townhomes and a five-story, 157-unit apartment building, as well as the demolition of a 109,000-square-foot office building at 2 Annabel Lane to build 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units.\nSunset Development has so far announced plans for 5,000 units at Bishop Ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The conversation around the horrific misdeeds of Jeffrey Epstein appears to be neverending as more revelations continue to drip out, including his connection to real estate. More on that in a bit.\nBut in business news there was a deal this week you probably won\u2019t read about at book fairs across the country.\nTony Malkin\u2019s Empire State Realty Trust is\nin contract\nto buy the Scholastic Building in Soho for $386 million, the company announced Tuesday.\nThe publisher owns the building at 555-557 Broadway and leases the majority of the space, which includes 368,000 square feet of office and 28,000 square feet of retail along Soho\u2019s prime shopping corridor.\nMalkin said he was attracted to the property for its in-place revenue and the ability to add value by marketing the \u201cthree uniquely large floors in a more than 110,000 square feet block.\u201d\nScholastic put the property up for sale earlier this year\n, eyeing a sale-leaseback deal. The public company reportedly planned to use the proceeds from the sale for \u201ccapital allocation priorities,\u201d reducing its debt and repurchasing shares.\nThe company bought the property in 2014\nfor $255 million\nfrom South Carolina-based landlord ISE America, which had\u00a0 since 1996.\nBilly Macklowe\u2019s career hasn\u2019t always been academic, but his bets are never dull. He recently completed construction of a\nmixed-use development\nin Park Slope, his first Brooklyn development and also developed a 52-unit condo building at\n21 East 12th Street\n.\nNext up? His William Macklowe Company\nacquired\nthe $46 million distressed loan note on the 129,000-square-foot, 10-story office building at 291 Broadway from Flagstar Bank.\nThe sale occurred after Flagstar sued the owner, Sutton Management, for foreclosure in July because of missed payments.\nThe building could be a candidate for a residential conversion if Macklowe forecloses or takes a deed-in-lieu.\nConversions are always a gamble. So is gambling. Luckily for dice rollers, the endgame for New York\u2019s gaming business is coming into focus.\nThe state Gaming Facility Location Board\nrecommended\ncasino licenses for the three remaining proposals in Queens and the Bronx: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe level of investment for each bid dictates the license term: Metropolitan Park and Resorts World qualify for 20-year licenses, while Bally\u2019s qualifies for a 15-year license.\nThe proposals, which included plans for hotels, entertainment venues and a focus on \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d next go to the Gaming Commission for final license issuance. That\u2019s expected to happen by the end of the month.\nYes, casinos are in a New York state of mind. Nas, famed rapper and Resorts World partner said it best after the recommendations were released: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day in New York City.\u201d\nFinally, the Epstein connection to real estate.\nThe late and disgraced financier privately\nclaimed\nin 2018 to have \u201chelped put them in biz,\u201d and by \u201cthem\u201d he meant Core Club founders Jennie and Dangene Enterprise, an allegation a spokesperson publicly refuted as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\nEmails released by the House Committee \u2014 a 20,000-page trove of documents \u2014 suggest a personal relationship between Epstein and Jennie Enterprise.\nThe invite-only Core Club caters to powerful clientele in real estate and finance, including figures like RFR\u2019s Aby Rosen and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.\n\u201c\u200b\u200b[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d said a spokesperson for Core Club.\nEpstein, as it turns out, was also\na reader of The Real Deal\n. While his interest in our publication is by no means a point of pride, released documents revealed emails with links to\nTRD\narticles,\nwhich appears to be a saved or printed web story from June 2019. The emails and articles touched on a Palm Beach development deal.\n",

        "content": "Luxury real estate is entering new territory in Chicagoland, but record-setting prices aren\u2019t necessarily boosting prospects of all sellers as several high-end deals resulted in losses.\nNovember brought about another record-setting home sale for Chicago, along with the movement of some long-sitting downtown condos as the usually sleepy holiday season approached.\nA\n16,000-square-foot mansion\nat 609 Sheridan Road in Winnetka fetched $32.5 million in the most expensive home resale in Illinois history on Nov. 19. The buyers paid $2 million more for personal property in the home, for a total price of $34.5 million.\nThe home was sold by Walton Street Capital co-founder Jeff Quicksilver and his wife, Ashley, who owns the Athene fashion boutique in Winnetka. The Quicksilvers had the French Provincial style home built in 2017.\nThe sale marked another win for @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay, who represented both sides on the deal. Radnay set the previous record just a few months ago with the sale of another\nWinnetka lakefront house for $31.3 million\n.\nRadnay has represented one or both parties on the top six most expensive Cook County home sales this year, leveraging her expertise of the North Shore lakefront to close deals. The demand for luxury lakefront homes in the ritzy northern suburbs has hit a fever pitch in the last year, pushing prices to numbers rarely seen in the Midwest.\nElsewhere,\nLake Geneva\nsaw its strong fall continue into November, with three waterfront houses trading there for more than $6 million.\nYet the luxury condo market in downtown Chicago is still struggling.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the biggest residential deals closed in November and what they show about the market.\nLake Geneva continues rally\nLeading the list of luxury Lake Geneva sales in November was a 7,100-square-foot house at\n831 Bayview Drive\n.\nThe home sold in a quiet, off-market transaction for $8.3 million on Nov. 17. The buyers didn\u2019t come from far: Philip and Melody Lekousis, who bought the house, sold a 3,300-square-foot house on Park Drive for $6 million earlier that month, trading up for the bigger Bayview Drive house.\nCompass agent Daniel Oleston represented the sellers, and Wendy Murphy with Mahler Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyers.\nThe sale rounded out a busy fall as several lakefront homes hit the market in Lake Geneva, taking advantage of surging demand for luxury property near Chicago. The house was the seventh lakefront home to sell there since October, and the fourth to fetch a price of more than $8 million.\nIn addition to the Lekousis\u2019 Park Drive house, a lakefront property at 8 Hillside Drive in Lake Geneva sold for $7.4 million last month.\nWilliam Farley cuts losses downtown\nAfter two years on the market and a series of price chops, former Fruit of the Loom CEO William Farley and his wife Shelley finally\nunloaded their spacious Gold Coast\npenthouse for $7.5 million, less than half of their original $16 million asking price.\nThe 12,000-square-foot co-op on the 14th floor of 209 East Lake Shore Drive sold for $625 per-square-foot. The sprawling penthouse is a combination of two units Farley bought decades ago. The penthouse had been on the market since 2022.\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe represented the seller, and Katherine Malkin, also of Compass, represented the buyer. They declined to comment on the buyer, and the buyer\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been determined through public records.\nThe sale comes as downtown Chicago is struggling to find its footing after years of weak demand and falling prices. Sellers like the Farleys have had to cut their asking prices, sometimes by millions of dollars to find buyers.\nBut interest is starting to come back to downtown and condos can find buyers if they\u2019re priced right. Lowe said the unit went under contract fairly quickly once it hit its last $7.9 million asking price.\nThat interest was reinforced in early December when billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s 67th\u2013floor condo at 800 North Michigan Avenue went under contract with a buyer, with an asking price of $12.5 million. The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet, but if it closes at the asking price it would be the most expensive sale for a single condo in downtown Chicago in at least three years.\nZach Lavine leaves No. 9 Walton\nZach LaVine was another downtown seller to\ntake a loss last month\n. The former Chicago Bulls star sold his lavish condo at 9 West Walton Street for $6.4 million, taking a half-million dollar loss on the sale.\nLaVine, who was traded to the Sacramento Kings in February, bought the 28th-floor condo from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack for $6.9 million in 2022. The 4,500-square-foot unit, which features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace and a custom tub with a built-in champagne bucket, is the latest turnover in a building that has become a hot spot for some of the most high-profile Chicago residents.\nGriffin also took a loss at the building in the last year. He sold off the top four floors of the building last year after making his exit from Chicago for Miami, and two of those units were bought by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\nFormer Blackhawks star Patrick Kane also sold his 25th-floor condo there for $6.4 million earlier this year.\n",

        "content": "Christmas miracle?\nVictor Coleman\u2019s real estate investment trust, where\nlosses\nare ballooning, made two early December announcements: Jon Bortz became a board member, and the company sold a Los Angeles office campus to tenant Riot Games at a price that permits it to repay the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the real estate.\nBortz, chairman and chief executive of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, replaced Jonathan Glaser on the board. Bortz founded the hotel REIT and added LaSalle Hotel Properties to Pebblebrook\u2019s holdings after a spirited bidding war with Blackstone back in pre-pandemic days.\nBortz saw total compensation of $7.4 million last year compared to Coleman\u2019s take of\nabout $25 million\n. He\u2019ll close the gap just a bit with his new gig, getting a $40,000 annual cash retainer, plus $20,000 as an audit and compensation committees member.\nNow for the Olympic Boulevard\ndeal\n\u2026 Hudson Pacific sold a 248,000 square foot, five-building office campus at 12333 West Olympic Boulevard for $150 million and got an extra $81 million payment for the termination of Riot Games\u2019 existing lease. The video-game developer picked up transfer taxes, which came to more than $8 million under the City of L.A.\u2019s Measure ULA rate of 5.5 percent for commercial deals over $10.6 million.\nThe total take, in any case, came to $231 million, giving Hudson Pacific cushion on the $206 million debt it was carrying. The firm increased its funds from operations outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $0.15 to $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.01 to $0.05, partly on the news.\nThe deal at $150 million comes out to about $605 per square foot, but with the bonus payment on the lease cancellation it comes out to $931 per square foot. That\u2019s more than Kilroy Realty recently\ndropped\non Maple Plaza, the Beverly Hills office campus that at a $205 million purchase price came out to around $700 per square foot. Even at $605 a square foot, it\u2019s more than the second priciest office deal in all of West Los Angeles during the third quarter per CBRE: Kilroy\u2019s $40 million\nsale\nof a Santa Monica property, which was around $500 per square foot.\nBofA Plaza makes 3 for Brookfield distress\nIn Brookfield land, Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to Bank of America Plaza, which the landlord once owned but lost to a receiver. The brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids to the $400 million debt balance.\nThe 1.4 million square foot, 57-story downtown Los Angeles tower at 333 South Hope Street is worth $212.5 million, or about $150 per square foot, based on recent assessments. That compares with $605 million value a decade ago. The latest distressed debt offering is one of three currently tied to Brookfield in DTLA these days, with the paper on the EY Plaza and the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower also on the block.\nFamily ties\nRemember the five brothers who emigrated from India, amassed a fortune in diamonds and Los Angeles real estate, then embroiled in a two-decade legal brouhaha that ended in a $10 billion verdict?\nOld habits die hard.\nTwo Jogani brothers, Rajesh and Chetan, are\nsuing\ntheir niece and nephew for $775 million. The two allege the younger relatives were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother, Haresh.\nLast year, Haresh was ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan, and their other brothers, to settle a dispute over their sprawling San Fernando Valley real estate portfolio. Now Rajesh and Chetan claim their brother made payments to his children, their niece and nephew to siphon off and hide assets from the real estate businesses.\nThe juicy complaint throws out accusations of \u201clooted\u201d money, \u201cunfettered control,\u201d \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct. Will it become another decades-long legal brawl?\nNewsom in New York\nCalifornia\u2019s ambitiously charismatic Governor Gavin Newsom \u2014 in a typical blue suit and open-collared crisp white shirt \u2014 appeared to have his next campaign in mind when he appeared at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit. But he barely touched on the most pressing problem of his current job: An intertwining homeless and housing crisis in the Golden State.\nNewsom took a page from President Donald Trump\u2019s handbook, claiming his critics have \u201cCalifornia derangement syndrome.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never tackled our housing crisis more aggressively than we tackled it last year,\u201d he later said.\nAlas, there were no follow-up questions to Newsom on the results of his efforts.\n",

        "content": "For New York City\u2019s new development market, 2025 has been a year of whisper trades and low inventory.\nWhile a handful of buzzy sales launches powered the market, executives, brokers and data analysts spent the year warning of an imminent inventory cliff, as demand for quality projects continued to significantly outpace supply.\n\u201cThe overall story is continuing to just whittle down on the inventory,\u201d said\nMarketproof\nco-founder Kael Goodman. \u201cThe total number of units is growing so slowly.\u201d\nThe market still had its fair share of highs.\nPerhaps the buzziest new development launch kicked off with little fanfare in early spring, when the sales team at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital started\nquietly inking deals\nfor condos at the development.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d said Goodman.\nThough some agents have described the West Village project as \u201cthe big one everyone is interested in,\u201d details about its sales progress have so far remained a tightly-guarded secret.\nThe few specifics that have surfaced have largely been through brokers\u2019 social media posts boasting about bringing buyers to the building, including last month when Bespoke\nposted on Instagram\nabout signing a contract for Unit 24, asking $31 million.\nInstagram also gave us the first hint of deals at the Flatiron Building conversion, another hotly anticipated project in Manhattan. Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold\nclaimed credit\nfor representing the first buyer to sign a contract at the building in an October post to his account. About a month later, Unit 3North, asking\n$19.4 million\n, landed among the top two most expensive deals inked in Manhattan that week.\nAnother notable pending deal was at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street, which found a buyer for its penthouse asking\n$88 million\n. If the unit closes at that price, it would break the record for the priciest condo deal in Downtown Manhattan.\nFor other projects, 2025 was the year of the comeback.\nDeals at 111 West 57th Street had been slow before Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team took over sales last summer. Since then, condos at the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall, developed by JDS Development and Property Markets Group, have been routinely\namong the two priciest\npending deals noted in weekly contract reports. The tower notched $400 million in sales this year and is 95 percent sold, according to a spokesperson.\nAnother Midtown project has also picked up steam after roughly a decade on the market. In October, 53 West 53rd Street, known as the MoMA tower, nabbed a buyer for Unit 65, last asking\n$47 million\n.\nAcross the East River, two rival new developments in Williamsburg have been vying for neighborhood price records, \u00a0with deals at Two Trees\u2019 One Domino Square and Naftali Group\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf continuously one-upping each other for the priciest condo deals per square foot. Both buildings are now just below 65 percent sold, according to data from Marketproof.\nUnderneath the highlights ran an undercurrent of concerns about the waning inventory pipeline in Manhattan.\n\u201cThe inventory situation is going to continue to get worse, it\u2019s not going to get better,\u201d said Corcoran Sunshine\u2019s Kelly Mack.\nBut the shrinking options aren\u2019t an upside for buildings that have been struggling to offload units, Mack said. Instead, those buyers are turning to the resale market or waiting for a new project to start selling.\n\u201cSeveral amazing new development properties that have recently come to market, or will in the first half of the year, will be beneficiaries of the current market dynamic,\u201d Mack said. The lack of inventory \u201ccreates a sense of urgency to act quickly on those properties.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nRyan Serhant\u2019s \u201cOwning Manhattan\u201d is back on Netflix.\nThe\nsecond season\nof the reality TV series premiered on Friday with eight episodes available on the streaming service. The show features a few new faces, including Peter Zaitzeff, who joined Serhant last January and took over sales at 200 Amsterdam for the brokerage.\nThe Real Deal\n, along other reporters, editors and influencers, got a sneak peek of the new season on Wednesday night at an event hosted by Serhant at Zero Bond. Members of the media, with cocktails and buckets of popcorn, cozied up on couches at the private club to watch the first episode, alongside the cast of the show.\n\u201cNot everyone lives in this season,\u201d Serhant, clad in a pale pink suit, said, calling back to a scene in the first season where he fired his former agent, Jonathan Normolle.\nIn response to a question about his leadership style, Serhant veered into an explanation of how the show came to be, alluding to a bidding war between Netflix and other streaming services.\n\u201cA lot of other people in real estate who have TV shows and don\u2019t anymore lost to us,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t your question.\u201d\nCast member Jordan Hurt described the new season as a \u201cdeeper dive into everyone\u2019s personal and professional story.\u201d Jessica Markowski added that she hoped to change her perception this time after she was painted as a villain last season for recording a podcast with Normolle making fun of some of their colleagues.\n\u201cIt was something I wasn\u2019t really proud of,\u201d Markowski said. \u201cSeason two, I really focused on business first and foremost and really proving to Ryan and the company that I can do this.\u201d\n\u201cComing in and getting, you know, beat up a little,\nThe brokerage hosted its official premiere party on Friday at Terminal 5 on West 56th Street.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was a penthouse at 443 Greenwich Street, which sold for just under\n$40 million\n. Unit PHG once belonged to Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, who bought the apartment for $20 million in 2017 and sold it five years later for $29 million.\nThe 5,300-square-foot condo has four bedrooms and a 2,650-square-foot wraparound terrace.\u00a0 Corcoran\u2019s Noble Black had the listing.\n",

        "content": "The California-to-Texas pipeline typically involves making money in California and buying a house in Texas.\nTim Leiweke\nput his own spin on the trope: The sports-and-entertainment venue developer made his money in California and got indicted in Texas.\nThe indictment is history because Leiweke is now the latest beneficiary of President Donald Trump\u2019s clemency, adding a line to a resume that includes prior stints as CEO of Oak View Group, and a stretch serving as top executive for billionaire Philip Anschutz\u2019s AEG Worldwide.\nLeiweke is no stranger to attention \u2014 he led AEG as it gathered up ownership of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, LA Galaxy soccer franchise, a piece of the Lakers, plus the L.A. Live entertainment complex and its\nCrypto.com\narena anchor.\nHis renown turned toward notoriety in Austin, however, where earlier this year he was accused of conspiring with a competitor to rig the bidding process for the $375 million development of the Moody Center, an arena and event venue at the University of Texas at Austin, to benefit Oak View Group. Leiweke promised subcontracting work on the project to the rival company in exchange for dropping its competing bid.\nHe flagrantly flouted the cardinal rule of business in the Internet age: \u201cdon\u2019t put in an email what you wouldn\u2019t want shared on a witness stand in court.\u201d Indeed, he apparently bragged about the scheme in an email, writing, \u201cwe were very clever to put together an agreement that scared everyone else away,\u201d the New York Times\nreported\n.\nTrump\u2019s own Department of Justice charged him with violation of the Sherman Act, the 19th-century antitrust law that prohibits conspiracies to restrain trade. Leiweke was indicted by a federal grand jury in July 2025.\nThe pardon was announced the day after the firm Leiweki founded named a new CEO, Chris Granger. Leiweke stepped down from his leadership position in June. The company was fined $15 million for its involvement in the scheme. It still manages the arena at the center of the crime.\nMehrdad Moayedi defines DFW real estate swagger\nIranian-American developer and founder of Centurion American\nMehrdad Moayedi\nmoved to Fort Worth from Tehran at the age of 15. A half-century later, he\u2019s the most prolific single-family lot developer in North Texas \u2014 at the same time that Dallas-Fort Worth exploded into one of the country\u2019s top five metro regions. The uniquely Texan story of his rise and his singular impact (he developed 75,000 acres of single-family lots) have made him an archetype of the North Texas developer.\nRobert A.M. Stern\u2019s Lone Star State legacy\nRenowned architect Robert A.M. Sterns,\nwho died last month\nat the age of 86, will be primarily remembered for the condos he designed in New York City and South Florida.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Sterns Architects (RAMSA) also garnered recognition for what\u2019s shaping up to be\na genre-defining project in Texas\n. In addition to New York entries such as the Naftali Group\u2019s Bellemont and 15 Central Park West for Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, the list of notable Stern-designed projects will soon include\nHoward Hughes Holdings\u2019 Ritz-Carlton Residences in The Woodlands\n.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\nTroubled CRE debt surges in Texas\nFor months, the value of Texas CRE loans flagged for each monthly foreclosure sale has hovered around $600 million. In December,\nit shot up to more than $900 million\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nOf the $911 million in loans scheduled for auction, $659 million is tied to multifamily properties. Plus, multiple loans flagged earlier this year but were never sold appear headed back to auction block, like\nCharles Cohen\u2019s Houston design center\nat 5120 Woodway Drive, which was originally headed to auction in June and July.\nVultures circle over Jon Venetos\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was\nhit with two new lawsuits\nfrom Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, the latest in a passel of default lawsuits against the value-add multifamily investor. In the filings, Keybank not only accuses Venetos of defaulting and letting the properties fall into disrepair; it also claims Venetos transferred $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account.\n",

        "content": "Developers aren\u2019t the only answer to the urgent question of how to fast-track rebuilding after a fire, but they\u2019re one part of the solution, said\nNew Pointe Communities\nfounder and President Scot Sandstrom.\nThe San Diego-based developer would know after his firm was part of the community rebuilding following the Witch Creek fires in 2007.\n\u201cIn San Diego, from Witch Creek, there were over 300 homes [burned]. We did 47,\u201d Sandstrom told\nThe Real Deal\nas he stood outside New Pointe\u2019s nearly completed home at 3245 Arrowhead Court in fire-scarred Altadena. The four-bed, four-bath property is one of 15 single-family homes the company plans to redevelop on spec.\n\u201cThere are 4,000 homes here that need to be rebuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everybody to be a part of it, not just homeowners rebuilding [or] builders rebuilding. I think it takes everybody.\u201d\nSandstrom, company executives and agents were on hand Thursday at Arrowhead Court for a caravan to show the property.\nArrowhead Court is the first and will be completed in January. It\u2019s already listed for just under $1.9 million, or $890 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Jeff Salcido and Mark Marquez are the listing agents.\nThe listing hits close to home for Salcido, whose brother and sister-in-law were the previous homeowners. With a baby on the way, rebuilding didn\u2019t make sense and the couple made the decision to sell to New Pointe.\nPalisades hits milestone\nThe Pacific Palisades is showing its own signpost of progress.\nRick Caruso\nwas on hand Friday to help mark that milestone at\n915 Kagawa Street\n.\nThomas James Homes executives celebrated the completion of the company\u2019s first rebuild as its CEO James Mead told press he thinks the number of TJH projects in the neighborhood could balloon to 100 next year.\nMead led Caruso on a tour of the four-bed, four-and-a-half-bath showcase home, with a gaggle of reporters, photographers, executives and media handlers at their heels as they walked the 6,500-square-foot property.\nCaruso will be back in the area on Saturday when, just a few blocks away from Kagawa Street, his Palisades Village will host its Christmas tree lighting event as he noted the juxtaposition of something seemingly so normal with the surrounding burn scars.\nLori Hyland on the future\nBy Monday, Hilton &amp; Hyland is expected to be fully back up and running after making the move to 345 North Maple Drive in Beverly Hills.\nThe legacy brokerage\u2019s move comes just a few weeks after its former landlord, Standard Oil Investment Group, asked a judge to throw out its lawsuit against Hilton &amp; Hyland for unpaid rent. At the time of the May filing, the brokerage owed more than $650,000 with over $65,000 tacked on in late fees, according to court documents.\nHilton &amp; Hyland Chair\nLori Hyland waved off\nany thoughts the move was the result of a dispute with the landlord, calling their relationship \u201cgood\u201d and the new address \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with our business.\u201d\nOn that last point, market chatter had reached a fever pitch earlier this year as agents continued to leave the firm and speculation mounted that a sale was in the works.\nHyland \u2014 whose husband was the late Jeff Hyland, co-founder of Hilton &amp; Hyland with Rick Hilton \u2014 said the brokerage was never up for sale and she\u2019s not looking to strike a deal in the future either.\n\u201cYou know\u2026 we live in a very, tight community,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beverly Hills all my life. I went to grammar school here. I know it very well. Everybody has something to say and it\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\nWhat comes after reality?\nA lot, if you\u2019re Josh Flagg.\nThe Compass agent is running his family\u2019s commercial real estate business, Flagg Family Capital, which has deep roots in Los Angeles commercial real estate and history.\nFlagg seems to be all over the place simultaneously, investing in consumer businesses, such as a Pop\u2019s Bagels; co-founding real estate media firm Estate Media; and, of course, serving clients with his residential real estate business.\nIf you missed the story in\nTRD\n\u2019s December issue,\nclick here\nfor a look at Flagg beyond the small screen.\n",

        "content": "When is the passage of a historic, citywide rezoning law that creates room for more than 36,000 new homes in a single city not enough? When that city is San Francisco, cradle of the YIMBY movement, where the state has mandated the city permit more than 82,000 new homes by 2031.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 Tuesday passage of the rezoning rules was a major political victory for freshman Mayor Daniel Lurie. The so-called Family Zoning Plan, approved in a 7-4 vote, upzoned about 60% of the city, including neighborhoods that haven\u2019t added new housing in decades, such as the Richmond, Sunset and Marina districts.\nIn a recent conversation with The Real Deal, a major housing California developer characterized the plan as a \u201cfantastic long-term win,\u201d but expressed skepticism about the short-term impact on housing development. Among the challenges in the near term: Interest rates on development financing and the material and labor costs of construction as the real pain points in building housing in San Francisco. The developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, doesn\u2019t expect costs to come down but foresees interest rates falling over the next year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think much housing gets added in 2026 or 2027,\u201d the developer said, adding that \u201cthe city is doing everything it possibly can,\u201d on the legislative side to spur housing development.\nMajor pro-housing groups in the state disagree. According to a report from the San Francisco Business Times, three such organizations have threatened to sue the city for not going far enough with the Family Zoning Plan. YIMBY Law, the California Housing Defense Fund and Californians for Home Ownership, are each mulling legal action over what they see as a violation of state law.\nThe groups point to an October report by the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office, which projected that the Family Zoning Plan would only produce 15,000 new homes over the next two decades \u2014\nwell short of the plan\u2019s promised capacity\n, and a fraction of the state\u2019s mandate for the city to permit 82,000 new homes by 2031. San Francisco planning officials told the Business Times that the state had endorsed early versions of the Family Zoning Plan.\nHowever, if the groups do file a lawsuit and are successful in court, the city, without an approved zoning plan, could end up out of compliance with state housing rules. The state may then implement builder\u2019s remedy, which allows developers increased latitude to propose projects without any consideration of local zoning law, provided projects designate a minimum of 10 percent of units for affordable rates, with the requirement ranging upward on a case-by-case basis.\nThen there are some who believe the city-wide rezoning goes too far, including District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan, one of four supervisors to vote against the changes. Chan\u2019s dissent sets the stage for the kind of debates San Franciscans will hear during the 2026 campaigns for Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s congressional seat. Chan, a progressive second-term supervisor who declared for the race late last month, is likely to operate as a sort of foil to\nstate Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s pro-housing development reputation\n. Wiener has already criticized Chan as \u201cunsuccessful at getting anything done\u201d since she joined the board of supervisors in 2021.\nWhile city hall was debating land use changes to spur new housing, two high-profile projects returned to the headlines with new life.\nThe troubled residential development at 360 Fifth Street is now poised to be taller and with more units after Novato-based\nThompson Builders recently submitted new building permit\ns that would take the project from 20 to 21 stories, with an additional 14 units, bringing the total to 272. The property faced a public nuisance lawsuit last year when San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu accused the former developer, Leap Development, of abandoning the partially excavated site. Thompson Builders, who was contracted by Leap to build the project, bought the site for $1.3 million earlier this year.\nDeveloper Crescent Heights is\nreportedly restarting talks for its $1 billion, 67-story residential tower\nin downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Business Times reported that the Miami-based developer has begun early-stage talks around making the 1,000-unit project a reality. According to the Business Times, Crescent Heights aims to break ground in 2027 on what would be San Francisco\u2019s first high-rise residential tower in years.\n",

        "content": "Rising home prices aren\u2019t going anywhere in Chicago.\nThat\u2019s according to a recent forecast from Realtor.com, which predicts the market\u2019s prices will rise 4.4 percent year-over-year in 2026, about twice as much as the national average.\nThe expected increase is largely due to a lack of new inventory in the metro, said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at Depaul University.\nChicago is behind most cities\nwhen it comes to home construction, ranking near the bottom among large metros in 2024.\n\u201cOther parts of the country that have exceeded pre-pandemic inventory levels are also areas where you see more new housing and construction,\u201d Smith said. \u201cChicago and Illinois tend to lag in producing new housing.\u201d\nThe bad news for brokers, however, is that despite\nhome prices going up\n, the report predicts sales volume will decrease by 2.3 percent, reflecting the tight competition and low supply in the market.\nSmith said his institute conducted a similar study for Illinois Realtors, which projected home prices in the metro will grow by 5 percent between October 2025 and October 2026.\nThis comes as\nChicago defies\nmuch of the nation over the last year in price growth while other regions, particularly in the South and West, have seen home values tumble.\nNationally, home prices are expected to grow by 2.2% and sales volume by 1.7%, the national report said. Chicago ranked among the top third of U.S. metros for projected price growth.\nThe Realtor.com report expects mortgage rates to drop slightly to 6.3 percent, down from an average of 6.6 percent this year. Those rates will likely unlock some new inventory as people move out of homes with low-interest mortgages, Smith said, but with strained inventory, new listings could see bidding wars and even higher prices.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a great short-term fix, other than just steadily reducing interest rates to unlock that inventory while also increasing demand,\u201d he said.\nEven if interest rates don\u2019t fall considerably next year, buyers have largely gotten used to the reality that rates above 6 percent are business as usual. Grigory Pekarsky, managing broker at Vesta Preferred Realty, said he hasn\u2019t worked with buyers who have expressed concern about mortgage rates in the last six months.\n\u201cThat just means a complete consumer absorption of normalization of these rates,\u201d Pekarsky said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not even a calculation in my opinion anymore.\u201d\nAs home prices are likely to rise across the metro, downtown Chicago may see a turnaround after years of falling prices and low demand, Pekarsky said. Pekarsky expects downtown prices to be buoyed in 2026 as buyers, especially first-timers, see it as an affordable and attractive option.\n\u201cI feel like next year the Gold Coast, River North, Loop market, is going to finally have its day,\u201d he said. \u201cThese areas are the last ones that just haven\u2019t recovered properly since COVID depression in pricing.\u201d\nMeanwhile, prices aren\u2019t likely to slow down in the hottest neighborhoods and suburbs that have seen major price growth in recent years. Jena Radnay, an @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent who has brokered many of the most expensive deals this year\nalong Winnetka\u2019s shoreline\n, said the North Shore suburbs are set for more growth in 2026.\nShe noted that the Mediterranean restaurant Avec is opening a location in Highwood. The introduction of the high end restaurant to the North Shore is a good sign for the continued rise of the area, Radnay said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be seeing a much more hip, savvy North Shore than we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think things are going to start growing up here.\u201d\nWhile the high-end areas will see growth, Smith said the same is true over the past few years in Chicago\u2019s lower cost neighborhoods, as buyers seek affordability in an increasingly competitive market.\n\u201cPrice growth is strongest in a lot of lower cost or more affordable places,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to disentangle who\u2019s buying it. Is it investors who are seeking relatively low value, or is it owner-occupants that are really looking for more affordable homebuying options, or is it a bit of both?\u201d",

        "content": "Brad Zackson\u2019s firm filed an eleventh-hour bankruptcy to halt a foreclosure on a highly ambitious Bronx megaproject.\nZackson put his company, Dynamic Star, and three affiliates\u2019 controlling equity stakes in Fordham Landing into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in White Plains on December 1. The move stopped a foreclosure auction scheduled for December 2.\nThe bankruptcies add to the intrigue of Fordham Landing, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use project along the Harlem River. The ground-up development had an odd cast of partners and was spearheaded by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, a protege of Fred Trump and a past business associate of Paul Manafort.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported on Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nIn recent months, Dynamic Star\u2019s lender initiated\nforeclosures\non the two parts of Fordham Landing. A mysterious lender with ties to Brooklyn-based CREMAC Asset Management alleged Dynamic Star had fallen behind on a $55 million loan and a $18.9 million loan, according to a notice for the foreclosure auction.\nDynamic Star could lose equity interests in both phases of the development if the foreclosure goes through.\nIn Fordham Landing\u2019s north phase of the project, the developers planned to build 2.7 million square feet of new development with 1.8 million market and affordable housing, 744,000 square feet of office, and 143,000 square feet of retail. In the south phase, they planned to build over 900 units of affordable housing.\nDynamic Star\u2019s larger north phase has a longer-term projection and Zackson said the development team has spent the past few years obtaining zoning approvals. In a bankruptcy filing, Zackson said once the zoning is approved, the developers are confident they will be able to bring in a new investor group to complete the project.\nMeanwhile, the 900 units of affordable housing in the south phase were expected to be delivered by next year, according to Zackson. The developers had recently secured over $55 million from the state to assist with site infrastructure.\nZackson said in a bankruptcy filing that the changes and modifications in the project limited the debtor\u2019s financing options.\nBut in another lawsuit, Dynamic Star\u2019s co-founder Segal blamed one of Fordham Landing\u2019s partners for some of its issues. Segal alleges Great Neck-based developer Igal Namdar was the actual buyer of its loans and attempted to foreclose to take control of the project.\nIn the bankruptcy filing, Zackson alleges Namdar may be the owner of the mezzanine loans. He further alleged Namdar failed to show up for an emergency meeting to discuss the bankruptcy.\nNamdar did not return a request to comment. Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy attorney, Kevin Nash, also did not return a request to comment.\n",

        "content": "Waste is a terrible thing to mind. Just ask Dominick Romeo.\nOther than a few building superintendents and extremely close followers of city politics, nobody noticed that the West 18th street resident ran against City Council member Erik Bottcher this fall. Romeo was crushed.\nThe superintendent is best known for organizing opposition to the Adams administration\u2019s trash pickup rules, which he said were taking him and fellow supers away from their families in the evening.\nThis platform proved woefully insufficient for Romeo to win on the \u201c\nBlue Collar/Fight and Deliver\n\u201d ballot line in a heavily Democratic Manhattan district. He got a mere\n9 percent\nof the vote.\nBut we\u2019re going to highlight Romeo\u2019s main issue anyway because it matters to thousands of property managers \u2014 and costs some of them money.\nTo reduce rats\u2019 opportunity to feed, the Adams administration required that garbage be set out at 6 p.m. (if in bins) or 8 p.m. (if in bags) instead of 4 p.m. As a result, some buildings \u2014 even affordable housing developments struggling financially because of\nfalling rents\nand\nnonpaying tenants\n\u2014 are\npaying overtime\nto staffers who take out the trash.\nThe Department of Sanitation says paying overtime because of the\nnew rule\nis a choice, not an obligation.\n\u201cEven if a building chooses to set out [trash] after 8 p.m., it is a logical fallacy to say that \u2018forces\u2019 overtime,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA building can simply set any work schedule that may fit its needs.\u201d\nThe agency offered a 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. set-out time for superintendents who work earlier shifts and designed routes to quickly collect the trash from the 2,500 buildings that opted in.\n\u201cWe have been extremely flexible to make this work for property owners and managers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nMayor Eric Adams deserves credit for going after rats, and it makes sense to require rat-resistant bins for garbage, even though\nfood waste\nis supposed to go into thicker brown bins.\nBut if bins are mandatory, why also require later set-out times? How many rats are going to venture out from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. to gnaw through hard plastic bins?\nDSNY\u2019s response was that this is not just about rats. New Yorkers, according to the agency, shouldn\u2019t have to share the sidewalk with trash during the afternoon rush.\nAt this point, I am obligated to point out that Sanitation is not obliged to promptly collect the trash. If you call 311 on collection day to report that your garbage was not picked up, the agent will not take your complaint. Instead, you will be told to call back the next day if the trash is still there.\nThis is because DSNY is not officially late until 24 hours have passed. Enterprising rodents still have a chance. Dominick Romeo, not so much.\n",

Total projected sellout of the top 10 also declined 34 percent year over year, from $1.4 billion to $918 million.\nIn Brooklyn, the listing inventory for new development condos in the third quarter declined year over year by nearly 25 percent, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\nIn Queens, the number of closed sales on new development condos declined by 55 percent in the same period.\nNew Empire Corp\u2019s 757 Flatbush Avenue took home the top spot on this year\u2019s list. The finish was a sign of the times: the project\u2019s $136 million projected sellout would have come in fifth in 2024.\nThe neighborhoods home to the biggest condo filings also shifted. Last year\u2019s list was dominated by the trendy neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Boerum Hill and Long Island City, while the biggest developments in 2025 were situated further away from Manhattan, including projects in Flatbush, Arverne, and Windsor Terrace.\n757 Flatbush Avenue, Flatbush | New Empire Corp. | $136 million\nNew Empire nabbed the most valuable filing in the two boroughs with its 757 Flatbush project. At 132 units, the developer expects the eight-story project to pull in $136.4 million at final sellout. The project will be anchored by a retail and commercial space.\nThe project broke ground this summer and nabbed a $9.2 million refinancing from Pacific National Financing this fall.\n127 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg | Joyland Group and Prospect Developers II | $144 million\nJoyland Group and Prospect Developers took the No. 2 spot with \u201cThe Sixth,\u201d their 43-unit development in Williamsburg near the waterfront.\u00a0 The six-floor project features two penthouse floors.\nUnits have not been listed but Corcoran is advertising the project. Joyland paid $43.3 million for the development site at the end of 2024, PincusCo reported.\n141 Beach 67th Street, Arverne | Beechwood Homes | $110 million\nThe waterfront development at 141 Beach 67th Street is expected to yield $110 million. The project, called Lighthouse, is one block from the ocean, on the Rockaways peninsula. The units start in the mid-$500,000s, according to the project website.\n23 Ocean Parkway, Windsor Terrace | Aview Equities | $109 million\nAview Equities is planning a 99-unit development where Windsor Terrace meets Kensington, at Prospect Park\u2019s southern edge. The project expects to sell out at $109 million.\nThe development, which has an alternate address of 57 Caton Place, made headlines this summer for allegedly\ndisturbing horses\nat the Prospect Park stables. In 2023, Parkview Financial filed a\npre-foreclosure suit\nrelated to a $66 million construction loan it originated for the project. The suit was discontinued last year.\n110 Boerum Place, Cobble Hill | Avdoo Partners | $100 million\nAvdoo Partners expects $100 million from its development on Boerum Place, which will deliver 21 residential units. Valley National Bank provided a $47 million construction loan this summer. Initial prices will start at about $3 million for a two-bedroom, according to City Realty.\n600 &amp; 610 DeKalb Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant | Allure Group, Joel Landau | $99 million\nThe development at 600 DeKalb Avenue will deliver 70 condos alongside 320 rental units, according to New York YIMBY. Allure Group secured $155 million in construction financing for the project, on the western side of Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is expected to bring in $99 million in sales.\n2102 East 1st Street, Gravesend | Redhoek + Partners | $76 million\nThis Gravesend project from Redhoek + Partners is slated for just 12 units, but a $76 million sellout. Eight of the units in the ground-up development, called the Onyx Residences, will be duplexes with double-height spaces, according to the project website.\n70-40 45th Avenue, Elmhurst | Ching Lam and Jia Xin Chen | $63 million\nThe condo building at 70-40 45th Avenue is expected to deliver 93 residential units, for a total sellout of $63 million. Sany Realty Group is listing the sponsor units, according to StreetEasy.

        "content": "Brookfield secured the No. 1 spot on the priciest office sales list in Los Angeles County for the first three quarters of the year with a downtown buy, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data and an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nUncommon Developers bought the roughly 1-million-square-foot property, at 601 South Figueroa Street, in June,\nfor $210 million\n, or $202 per square foot,\nTRD\nreported.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. You can see the top 10 office sales in L.A. County by clicking\nhere\n.\nWhile the transaction marked the biggest commercial sale in Los Angeles County, it was still not enough for\nBrookfield\nto cover the $250 million in debt on the 52-story tower, which was originally set to mature last July.\n\u201cThis is a landmark sale for Downtown L.A.,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Mark Schuessler, who arranged the deal for Uncommon in the deal along with colleagues Sean Fulp and Jordan Garcia.\nNewmark\u2019s Kevin Shannon represented Brookfield in the sale.\nBrookfield has been scaling back its Los Angeles office holdings after a string of post-pandemic defaults. Last year it\nunloaded\n777 South Figueroa \u2014 another of its Downtown trophy properties \u2014 for $145 million, about half its outstanding debt, which defaulted in 2023.\nL.A. County\u2019s top sale was followed closely by the $205.3 million trade of\nMaple Plaza\nin Beverly Hills.\nTishman Speyer sold the 293,000-square-foot building at 345 North Maple Drive to Kilroy Realty in September.\nFor Tishman Speyer, the sale completed a trio of dispositions in the submarket in just over a year; for\nKilroy\nit marked the firm\u2019s foray into the submarket.\nNo. 3 on the list is Clarion Partners\u2019 sale of\ni|o at Playa Vista\nto Barings for $150.7 million. The office campus includes 12130, 12150 and 12180 Millennium Drive.\n",

        "content": "A pair of North Dallas homes sold within a day of each other, totaling almost $24 million in listing price volume in a couple of the area\u2019s toniest enclaves.\nThe estate of the late Barron Kidd, a North Texas rancher and oilman, sold his one-time Highland Park home to an LLC registered to Sarah Penn James on July 31, according to recently released public records. The next day, prominent entertainment agent Gary Osier sold his Old Preston Hollow home to Jeffrey and Lori Runnfeldt, an investor and boutique proprietor, respectively.\nBoth homes listed in the spring and landed on the Houston Association of Realtors\u2019 ranking of the ten\nmost expensive residential listings in the state\nin\nMay\n.\nThe Kidd property in Highland Park,\u00a0 a 1936 six-bedroom, six-bathroom home on Glenwood Avenue, was asking $11.5 million when it sold \u2014 almost $2,000 per square foot for the 6,000-square-foot property. Located in a conservation district and platted as its own subdivision for the seller in 1997, the verdant lot includes a putting area, a greenhouse and a stream fed by Turtle Creek. Compass agent Elly Holder had the listing.\nThe 90-year-old, tree-cloaked Kidd home has little in common with Osier\u2019s 10-year-old contemporary build of glass and steel in Preston Hollow. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, 10,300-square-foot home is on a 1.1-acre lot on Park Lane. Osier, whose clients include Foreigner, Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler and the Beach Boys, was asking $11.7 million for the home when it sold, or about $1,000 per square foot. The property includes a guest casita and a pool. Allie Beth Allman and Associates agent Alex Perry had the listing.\nFinal sale prices are unavailable.\nThe two are the first to sell among ultra-luxury homes that listed statewide in late April and May. Most of their peers on HAR\u2019s May top ten list, including\nMehrdad Moayedi\u2019s spec mansion near the Crespi Estate\nin Dallas and a\nwaterfront estate in Horseshoe Bay\n, are still for sale.\n",

        "content": "Entry-level homeowners in Sugar Land, a suburb in America\u2019s amplest housing market, will be able to cover more renovation costs with city funding in 2026.\nSugar Land, a city about 19 miles southwest of Houston, announced Wednesday that it will expand its Great Homes Update Program, which reimburses homeowners for certain property enhancements. Since 2023, the program has covered 10 to 25 percent of project costs with a maximum payment of $10,000. Starting January, reimbursements of 50 percent will be available to homeowners whose properties are in the bottom 3 percent of single-family home values, amounting to about a thousand homes in Sugar Land, according to Ana Rodriguez, Sugar Land community development coordinator.\nThe city is also expanding eligibility to include heir owners. The Great Homes Program formerly required traditional proof of ownership, such as a recorded deed, but many heir-occupied homes have not gone through a formal title process.\nOnly eight homes in this category have used the program over the last three years. The city hopes the expansion will bring in 25 additional participants in 2026.\n\u201cMany of the households in the bottom 3 percent faced barriers that made it difficult to meet the program\u2019s original requirements. Some did not carry homeowner\u2019s insurance, or had fully paid-off homes, which meant they lacked the documentation required to qualify,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cOthers could not meet the $4,000 minimum project cost, making the program financially out of reach.\u201d\nThe program is available to landlords as well as owners who occupy their properties, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cThere are quite a few neighborhoods that we saw fall into this 3 percent bracket: Mayfield Park, Covington Woods, Farrington Place, Chimneystone and Ragus Lake,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nSo far, Sugar Land has reimbursed $791,000 for projects totaling $5.3 million in costs through the program. The city has budgeted $200,000 for the program for fiscal year 2026.\nThe Houston metro area has\nmore homes for sale than any other metro in the country\n. It\u2019s also the only metro in the Texas Triangle where inventory has grown apace in the past few months; sellers have been\nleaving the market\nin Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. The distinction is probably due to a swift pipeline of\nmaster-planned communities\nin the Houston area, where over 20 percent of all master-planned community sales in the country take place.\nNearby master-planned community projects include a\n7,000-home development east of Fulshear\n. Hines received $129.2 million in Texas Infrastructure Program bonds for the project, secured by Fort Bend County MUD reimbursements.\n",

It\u2019s marketing the 18-story, 185,000-square-foot office building as a redevelopment play, according to a release from the firm. Avison Young\u2019s Mike B. Kennedy, James Nelson, Erik Edeen and Sullivan Johnston are leading the effort.\nThe property was built in 1958 and renovated in 2014. Its zoning would allow for redevelopment as multifamily, hospitality and office. The building is nearly vacant and being listed with no asking price, Avison Young said.\nThe current owner is Thistle Creek Capital, which bought the property in an\n$8 million credit bid\n\u2014 $43 a square foot \u2014 at a foreclosure auction in February 2024. It was previously owned by\ntroubled syndicator Kenny Wolfe\n, who founded Dallas-based Wolfe Investments.\nWolfe announced his purchase of the tower, whose capital stack included the $13 million loan from Thistle Creek and $9 million in equity, less than a year earlier. He had planned to convert it from offices to 238 apartment units. Around the same time, he partnered with Dallas-based developer Bluelofts and purchased the historic Oil &amp; Gas Building in downtown Fort Worth with similar conversion plans. He lost that building to foreclosure, too.\nWolfe\u2019s downfall was defined by his attempt to stick the landing on an ambitious pivot from collecting a portfolio of dollar stores and older apartment complexes to executing the notoriously challenging office-to-resi conversion in downtown Dallas, Fort Worth and Cleveland.\nDespite the building\u2019s complicated recent past, conversion experts agree it has potential.\nA 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in coordination with New York University and Columbia University identified the midcentury-modern tower as one of 50 North Texas buildings structurally ripe for conversion.\nNew York University professor and report author Arpit Gupta said 211 North Ervay \u201cmet all the criteria\u201d for a conversion candidate, including location, age and the distance between the building\u2019s core and its windows.",

In January, the seller, an entity registered to an address in Budapest, Hungary, dropped the price to $35 million before lowering it again in June. The seller bought it from OKO Group in 2022 for\n$35 million\n.\nCorcoran\u2019s Connor Cuccinelli and Noble Black had the listing.\nThe building at 730 Fifth Avenue snagged its first resale in July, when Unit 23A sold for\n$64 million\n, up from the $51 million the seller paid for it earlier this year.\nTwo townhouses, each asking $12.5 million, tied for the No. 2 spot last week. One of them, a 17-foot-wide abode on the Upper East Side, was featured as the exterior of Holly Golightly\u2019s apartment building in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d\nThe property at\n169 East 71st Street\n, which last traded for $7.4 million in 2015, hit the market in May asking $15 million. It\u2019s currently configured as a two-family home with a garden-level apartment.\nThe home, built in 1910 and renovated in 2015, spans four stories and 4,500 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features an elevator and landscaped garden.\nCorcoran\u2019s Caroline Bass had the listing.\nThe other townhouse is at 23 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village. The four-story, 25-foot-wide property is divided into three apartments, including a five-bedroom triplex, studio and four-bedroom duplex.\nThe home, which hasn\u2019t traded in more than two decades, also hit the market in May, asking just under $15 million.\nCompass\u2019 Nick Gavin, Ugo Russino and Allie Fraza had the listing.\nOf the 29 properties, 17 were condos, five were co-ops and seven were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $233 million, which works out to an average price of $8 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home was on the market for roughly two years and had a discount of 11 percent.\n",

At that amount, the typical new one-bedrooms at the national average of about 735 square feet would lease for approximately $4,200 per month.\nThe new high for Mountain View comes as artificial intelligence companies flock to the Bay Area in droves, attracting thousands of workers and executives in need of housing.

By contrast,\nrent growth nationwide\nhas fallen to 0.5 percent year-over-year, while vacancy has increased to 4.4 percent and net absorption dropped to its lowest third-quarter levels since 2022, per CBRE data.\nLast month, the Mountain View City Council rejected a\nproposal from Greystar Real Estate Partners\nthat would increase housing supply in the city. The South Carolina-based firm has long planned to turn a J.P. Morgan Chase branch at 749 West El Camino Real into a 299-unit mixed-use development. Greystar requested to increase its construction timeline from two years to eight, but the city denied that request.\nUnder its state-mandated housing goals, the City of Mountain View must plan for 11,135 new housing units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

GFP Real Estate answered the call.\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation selected GFP to redevelop the 10-story office building in the Financial District, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. GFP will revamp the 1960s-built government building with a mixed-income residential building with thousands of units.\nSpecifically, there are 3,700 units planned for the site, a drastic increase from the 2,000 units Mayor Eric Adams sought when revealing plans for the property back in January; Adams\nannounced plans\nfor the property in his State of the City address as part of a broader \u201cManhattan Plan,\u201d an initiative he said would bring 100,000 new homes to the borough over the next decade.\nAt least 25 percent of the units will need to be designated affordable. Other aspects of the redevelopment include 40,000 square feet of open space for the public and a fitness center.\nDetails of the acquisition costs for GFP were not disclosed, but funds from purchasing the city-owned site will go towards finding office space for relocating city tenants, including the New York City Department of Housing Preservation &amp; Development, the Housing Choice Voucher program and GrowNYC.\nThe Hamilton-Madison House, a social services nonprofit provider, will receive a purpose-built facility on the site and relocate nearby during the construction period.\nIn a statement, GFP co-chief executive officer Brian Steinwurtzel said the firm was \u201chonored to have been selected\u201d for the project. He also talked about a \u201ccollaborative process with the community,\u201d which will be put to the test with land use reviews in 2027.\nThe project builds on Adams\u2019 executive order calling on city agencies to identify city-owned or controlled property suitable for housing development.\nGFP is fresh off another FiDi conversion, turning a former 1.1-million-square-foot office property at 25 Water Street into one of the largest office-to-resi conversions in U.S. history. GFP, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital recently secured\nan $835 million refinancing package\nfrom Apollo and GIC for the 1,320-unit project, which began leasing in late January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Nick Kokonas, co-owner of Chicago\u2019s Alinea restaurant and founder of the Tock reservation platform, sold his distinctive Old Town property at a significantly discounted price of $4.65 million.\nThe restaurateur and his wife, Dagmara Kokonas, closed the deal for their home at 223 West Eugenie Street at nearly $2 million below the original asking price of $6.84 million set in October 2023, according to\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\n. The property consists of two 19th-century houses joined by a modern glass bridge, along with two rear buildings, one dating back to the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\nInitially, Kokonas attempted to\nsell the home\nusing his self-devised \u201cinverted commission\u201d model, which ties the buyer\u2019s agent commission to the accepted offer price, with a higher percentage commission tied to a higher sale price. The property sat on the market for months with no asking price and no listing agent. He had successfully used this method in previous sales in Winnetka, Kenilworth and Northbrook.\nHowever, after five months without a sale, Kokonas turned to\nCompass\nagent Jeff Lowe, who eventually reduced the listing price twice, bringing it down to just under $5.9 million by September 2024.\nThe final sale represents a roughly 32 percent discount from the original asking price.\nWhether the Kokonases profited on the property is uncertain. They purchased it for $3.66 million in 2009 and invested heavily in renovations, including a restaurant-style kitchen and updates to the historic outbuildings. If renovation costs exceeded $1 million, the couple may have taken a loss.\nNeither Kokonas nor Lowe commented on the sale, and the buyer remains unidentified in public records. From the street, the property appears as two modest wood frame houses typical of Old Town, but inside it blends historic architecture with modern design, including interiors inspired by Edgar Miller\u2019s neighborhood work in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe sale comes during Kokonas\u2019 broader career transition. In September 2024, he sold his ownership stake in the Alinea Group, retaining only a passive minority interest in Alinea itself. His partnership with chef Grant Achatz had spanned 19 years, during which Alinea became Chicago\u2019s sole three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Recently, Michelin downgraded Alinea to two stars.\nThe Alinea Group continues to operate seven other venues, including Next and the Aviary.\nBeyond restaurants, Kokonas co-founded Tock in 2014 with Google engineer Brian Fitzpatrick. Initially focused on restaurant reservations, the platform expanded to wineries and hospitality bookings. Squarespace acquired Tock for $400 million in 2021, and Kokonas remained with the company until early 2023.\nThe Eugenie Street sale marks the 147th\nChicago home sale\nabove $4 million in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 136 set in 2022. The surge highlights the strength of the city\u2019s\nluxury housing market\n, even as the broader market remains relatively flat.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Sharon Baum, a veteran Manhattan luxury broker, has died at the age of 85.\nThe powerhouse broker spent more than 30 years as one of the most successful agents in New York City, building on nearly two decades as a female trailblazer in corporate leadership before moving into brokering luxury deals.\nCorcoran CEO Pam Liebman announced Baum\u2019s death in an internal memo to the brokerage where\nBaum began her career in 1991\n, lauding her as a character of style and substance. Baum was with the firm for more than three decades before joining Douglas Elliman last year.\n\u201cSharon was a pioneer in every sense of the word: sharp, stylish and always several steps ahead,\u201d wrote Liebman.\nTo accompany her deals for premier properties, she sported a diamond pin on her lapel and a forest green Rolls-Royce bearing the license plate, \u201cSOLD 1,\u201d that she temporarily retired following the Great Financial Crisis for something more understated.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so focused on knowledge and intelligence rather than pizzazz,\u201d Leonard Steinberg told\nthe Daily News in 2015\n. \u201cShe has substance.\u201d\nJonathan Conlon, Baum\u2019s longtime associate at Corcoran with whom, along with John Gasdaska, she decamped for Douglas Elliman last year, said part of Baum\u2019s legacy is reinventing the profession that had long been treated as a pastime.\n\u201cShe was one of the first true professionals who moved into the world of New York City real estate and formalized it and treated it like a business,\u201d he said. \u201cShe really helped get the New York City real estate market and business to start seeing itself that way and not as this sort of social pastime.\u201d\nBorn in 1940 in Jefferson City, Missouri, Baum attended Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College and was\none of eight women in the first co-ed graduating class\nof Harvard Business School in 1965.\nShe later joined Chemical Bank, where she spent 17 years and became the company\u2019s first female vice president. She was the subject of a 1975 Wall Street Journal article\non the rise of \u201cdual-career couples,\u201d\nas she and her husband Stephen worked full-time jobs. \u201cEvery single minute is taken up,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal in 1975. \u201cI never have time to watch TV or read a book.\u201d\nBaum made the jump to real estate in 1991, when she joined Corcoran. She quickly rose as the firm\u2019s top-selling agent, which she credited to the vast network she had built working in business for nearly two decades.\n\u201cWhat I did was a big mailing with very nice engraved cards that I sent to my master list, saying I was no longer at Chemical Bank, and I am going into a whole new field \u2014 and word got around,\u201d Baum previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cShe single-handedly walked the high-end market into my business,\u201d Corcoran co-founder Barbara Corcoran, who recruited Baum to her firm before selling it in 2001, told the Daily News. \u201cShe was that powerful. She\u2019s one of the most well-connected, well-wired brokers in Manhattan. I adore her.\u201d\nIn 1996, she was already doing over $50 million a year in sales, focusing on pre-war co-ops and townhouses. She scored one of her biggest deals in 2006, when she sold the $40 million Duke-Semans mansion on Fifth Avenue. The only agent to receive the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s Deal of the Year award twice, Baum was also awarded REBNY\u2019s Henry Forster award for lifetime achievement in 2011. As of 2024, she claimed over $2 billion in sales over the course of her career.\nKnown as the Queen of Park and Fifth avenues, Baum evolved her business with the times as money started flowing downtown, turning her relationship with Gasdaska and Conlon into a strategic partnership in 2016.\nGasdaska recalled driving through the West Village with Baum for a pitch when she asked, \u201cIs this Tribeca?\u201d\n\u201cI was like, \u2018You don\u2019t come down here very often,\u2019\u201d Gasdaska. \u201cShe started to laugh and said, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go below 59th Street.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut she knew what she knew, and she knew what she didn\u2019t,\u201d he added.\nThat didn\u2019t stop Baum from finding downtown apartments for Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence, helping the former secure a $20 million penthouse in Tribeca that was once owned by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson.\nWhen Conlon and Gasdaska decamped for Elliman in 2024, Baum joined, as the pair had started helping manage her book of business in her later years.\n\u201cHaving her be a business partner over the past nine years has been a true honor in our career,\u201d Gasdaska said.\nElliman in an internal memo said despite Baum\u2019s short time at the firm, \u201cmany of us are blessed to have known and worked with her over the course of her long, trailblazing career.\u201d\n\u201cTo call Sharon a legend would be an understatement,\u201d said Elliman CEO of Brokerage for New York Richard Ferrari.\nBaum is survived by her husband, Stephen, their two sons, Ben and Sam, and her brother, David, and his husband, Ronald, according to Elliman.",

It is currently 98 percent occupied.\n\u201cOur investment in a transformative renovation has positioned 99 Park as one of the most sought-after addresses near Grand Central Station, and the building\u2019s strong leasing activity this year reflects that success,\u201d said leasing director Craig Panzirer.\nGlobal Holdings has been significantly upgrading the 1950s-era, 600,000-square-foot office building just south of Grand Central between East 39th and 40th streets. This included a redesigned facade, and amenities such as a speakeasy, golf simulator and conference center. The renovation is expected to be completed next year.\nEarlier this year, the landlord signed Amalgamated Bank to a 15-year lease in a relocation from its longtime headquarters at 275 Seventh Avenue. The 94,000-square-foot deal included space on the ground floor for a private entrance lobby.\nOther recent deals at 99 Park include the strategic advisory firm Geller &amp; Company, international children\u2019s apparel company Garan, wealth-management firm Steward Partners and Metropolitan Bank.\nGeller signed its lease\nfor 45,000 square feet\nin March, relocating from 909 Third Avenue. That same month, Garan doubled its space at the building.\nThe area around Grand Central has been one of the tightest office submarkets in the city in recent years. The availability rate was 13.6 percent in the third quarter, according to Savills.\n",

The University of Chicago owns the land and issued a 65-year ground lease to the Vue53 development team when the project began.\nVista and Boston-based Bain later refinanced that debt with a $45 million loan from Argentic in 2023, according to records.

        "content": "Outer borough offices didn\u2019t have the Manhattan magic.\nBrooklyn and Queens office landlords spent much of 2025 courting the same tenants that kept the outer boroughs afloat since the pandemic: government agencies, schools and mission-driven groups. Private-sector users remained scarce, and the boroughs again lagged Manhattan\u2019s healthier leasing market.\nLong Island City and parts of Brooklyn continued to draw big-footprint tenants, but the surge of Midtown leasing still hasn\u2019t translated across the river. Brokers say outer borough availability remains high and deal flow uneven, even as education and public-service users quietly make up a growing slice of new leases.\nHere are the largest office deals of the year in Queens and Brooklyn, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nNYC Department of Transportation | 47-25 34th Street | 212,094 square feet\nThe city\u2019s DOT brought the year\u2019s biggest outer borough deal,\nsigning on\nfor more than 212,000 square feet at 47-25 34th Street in Long Island City. The agency took the space from Metropolitan Realty Associates and Nuveen and plans to use it for both industrial and office uses. Newmark and SL Green represented the landlord side and a CBRE team represented the tenant.\nSpectrum | 59 Paidge Avenue | 200,000 square feet\nThe cable provider\nrenewed\nits 200,000-square-foot lease at 59 Paidge Avenue in Greenpoint, opting for another 10 years at the Steel Equities-owned site. Spectrum has occupied the low-slung complex since 2011 and locked in one of Brooklyn\u2019s largest commitments of 2025.\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School | 181 Livingston Street | 147,944 square feet\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School continued the trend of education tenants backfilling slow office corridors, taking nearly 148,000 square feet at Tishman Speyer\u2019s 181 Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn in the spring. At the time, it was Brooklyn\u2019s\nlargest lease\nsince the third quarter of 2023.\nU.S. General Services Administration | 159-30 Rockaway Boulevard | 139,377 square feet\nThe GSA signed a major lease in Jamaica at an Edward J. Minskoff building,\nTRD\nreported\nat the start of the year, to be used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Queens. CBRE represented the federal tenant, while JLL handled the landlord side.\nAdministration for Children\u2019s Services | 1000 Dean Street | 105,000 square feet\nACS inked a full-building lease at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights, taking 105,000 square feet, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The move was a consolidation of spaces in Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York.\nBeacon Mobility | 2647 Stillwell Avenue | 83,000 square feet\nTransportation firm Beacon Mobility signed\nan 83,000-square-foot lease\nat Turnbridge Equities\u2019 Gravesend property. Turnbridge Equities acquired the Gravesend site two years ago for $13 million. Cushman &amp; Wakefield repped both sides of the deal.\nPlaza College | 118-35 Queens Boulevard | 80,000 square feet\nPlaza College renewed its Forest Hills presence,\ntaking 80,000 square feet\nat Muss Development\u2019s tower. CBRE\u2019s Roy Chipkin represented the tenant.\nNYC School Construction Authority | 30-30 47th Avenue | 75,000 square feet\nThe SCA extended its lease for 15 years at Atlas Capital Group\u2019s Long Island City building, at an asking rent of $45 per square foot. Unfortunately for ownership, the $300 million loan tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot office property was\nsent to special servicing\nin September for \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d according to Morningstar Credit.\n",

        "content": "Crescent Real Estate bought the Ryder Colonnade office building in Coral Gables for $70.4 million, marking a 13 percent discount from its price over a decade ago.\nFort Worth, Texas-based Crescent bought the 11-story building at 169 Coral Way from AEW Capital Management, according to records. The buyer borrowed a $67.9 million loan from FS Credit Originator, in the care of Rialto Capital Management.\nCompleted in 1988, Ryder Colonnade spans 205,400 square feet, according to its website. It\u2019s attached to the Hotel Colonnade Coral Gables, which wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nThe price amounts to $331 per square foot.\nThe tower was recently rechristened to include the \u201cRyder\u201d name after\nRyder System\n, a Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant, moved its headquarters there. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and it moved to a smaller office, citing the remote work shift.\nIn 2013, an entity tied to Boston-based TA Associates Realty paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building, property records show. In 2015, AEW Capital, also based in Boston, took over the entity, suggesting it purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, according to state corporate records.\nCrescent, led by Chairman John Goff and CEO Conrad Suszynski, is a real estate investor, manager and developer with $4.4 billion of assets under management as of February, according to its website. (The firm is different from Miami-based Crescent Heights.)\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, insurance and other costs such as materials.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023. This has made refinancing harder and also squeezed landlords with floating-rate debt, increasing their loan obligations.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office market prospered from an influx of out-of-state companies over the past five years, increasing rents to new records. Still, some landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher rates and remote work, prompting them to sell their office buildings.\nIn other discounted deals, Orlando-based Foundry Commercial sold the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center building at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\nin January, nearly $21 million less than its price seven years ago.\nIn May, Boston-based Rockpoint, Miami-based Tricera, Palm Beach-based NDT Development and Boston-based New England Development sold the 18-story One Clearlake tower at 250 South Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n. It marked a nearly 26 percent discount from its price four years ago.\n",

        "content": "Affluent buyers looking for second homes are returning to downtown Chicago\u2019s condominiums, judging from recent sales activity at Cirrus, a 47\u2011story luxury tower in\nLakeshore East\n.\nAccording to Brad Brondyke of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who leads sales for developers Lendlease and Magellan, about 30 of the 50 condos put under contract in 2025 have gone to second home buyers,\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business reported\n.\nFor several years, affluent buyers have largely avoided purchasing downtown condos, citing concerns about safety, urban vitality and long\u2011term value. The reversal of that trend at Cirrus is notable because second home buyers historically fueled much of Chicago\u2019s luxury condo market.\nBrondyke described the uptick as \u201cgreat news for the city,\u201d signaling that lingering fears about downtown living may be diminishing.\nCirrus, at 211 North Harbor Drive with views of Du Sable Lake Shore Drive, offers high\u2011end finishes, lakefront vistas and proximity to cultural attractions. These features aim to appeal to buyers seeking a pied\u2011\u00e0\u2011terre or weekend retreat. Of the 50 contracts signed this year, three are not yet closed but are expected to finalize by year-end.\nChicago\u2019s downtown condo market has faced challenges since the pandemic, with sluggish sales and price stagnation compared to suburban and single\u2011family homes. Safety concerns and perceptions of urban decline further dampened demand. The recent momentum at Cirrus suggests a turning point, particularly among affluent buyers who can afford discretionary purchases.\nWhile the number of contracts is modest compared to the overall market, the proportion of second home buyers \u2014 roughly 60 percent of Cirrus\u2019s 2025 sales\n\u2014 is significant. It highlights renewed confidence in downtown Chicago as a desirable destination, even for part-time luxury living.\nThis trend also aligns with broader patterns in Chicagoland\u2019s luxury\nhousing market\n, where multimillion\u2011dollar sales in both suburban and urban areas have surged in 2025.\nThe most recent second-home purchase at Cirrus was last week at $4.05 million for a unit on the 47th floor, Brondyke said. That represents a nearly 19 percent discount from the developers\u2019 original asking price of $4.98 million in October 2022.\nThe unit has about 3,650 square feet with a terrace facing Lake Michigan and is the third\ncondo at Cirrus\nto trade at\n$4 million or more\n, Brondyke added. The average sale price for a Cirrus unit runs about $1.3 million.\n\u2014- Joel Russell",

The project, supported by incentives from the city of Arlington and the Arlington Economic Development Corporation, will transform 14 acres at 1500 Convention Center Drive.\nThe Sheraton\n, an aging 311\u2011room property built in 1984, sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 existing 888\u2011room Arlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center and Live! by Loews in the city\u2019s\nEntertainment District\n.\nThe new Loews property will feature 513 rooms, 25,000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a parking garage with at least 735 spaces. Urbana Varro Hospitality Management Company, which operates the Sheraton, notified the Texas Workforce Commission that the hotel will close on Feb. 15, resulting in 110 layoffs.\nLoews spokesperson Lisa Garland declined to provide detailed construction timelines but hinted at an announcement in January. Marty Wieder, director of the Arlington EDC, confirmed the layoffs are tied to redevelopment plans and emphasized the strength of Arlington\u2019s hospitality market. He noted that displaced workers should find opportunities at other growing hotel properties in the area.\nThe financial agreement approved in 2023 includes $5 million from the EDC for site improvements, $15 million over seven years for the garage, and $20 million from the city over eight years for garage costs. Additional grants of $3.8 million over 10 years and $1.3 million over 14 years will be provided once the hotel opens.\nThe Loews project is part of a broader wave of hotel development and renovation in Arlington\u2019s Entertainment District. The\n$54 million Caravan Court\n, a 145\u2011key upscale hotel on Division Street, is under construction and expected to open by the 2026 World Cup. Meanwhile, the Crowne Plaza Suites Arlington, owned by Equinox Hospitality, is undergoing a $9 million renovation to update 200 rooms and common areas, while converting its indoor pool into 5,000 square feet of meeting space. The city has entered a 10\u2011year agreement to provide $3.25 million in support between 2025 and 2027.\nThe projects underscore\nArlington\u2019s push\nto expand its hospitality infrastructure, positioning the city as a destination for business events and tourism with a strategic location halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

Financial details of the sale were not disclosed, but Dallas Central Appraisal District records value the 15\u2011acre property at 901 West Walnut Hill Lane at $51.5 million, although tax valuations often lag behind market prices.\nCoppell\u2011based office maker Vari sold the property, formerly called VariSpace Las Colinas, after acquiring it in 2019. Originally built in 1982 as the headquarters for Zales, the complex includes three office buildings totaling more than 400,000 square feet, along with a four\u2011level parking garage. At its peak, the site accommodated nearly 3,000 employees. Zales is now part of Signet Jewelers based in Akron, Ohio.\nOn its website, VariSpace calls the Las Colinas property a \u201cfully furnished turnkey office space\u201d with an onsite 7,000-square-foot cafe and lobby coffee bar, a conference and training center, a Wi-Fi enabled park and a 10,000-square-foot fitness center. Two recent leases at the property include a\nMUFG Bank renewal\nand the\nUniversity of St. Augustine for Health Sciences\n.\nCaterpillar relocated its\nglobal headquarters\nfrom Deerfield, Illinois, to the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market in 2022. The company currently employs more than 800 people at Williams Square and about 6,600 statewide. Caterpillar has maintained a presence in Texas since the 1960s.\nLast year\nthe company added about 50,000 square feet to its Williams Square space.\nWith reported revenue of $64.8 billion in 2024, Caterpillar is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off\u2011highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel\u2011electric locomotives.

        "content": "The real estate industry spent\nmillions of dollars\ntrying to prevent Zohran Mamdani from becoming mayor. The effort failed.\nMeanwhile, some working in the industry\nmade comparatively modest donations\nto Mamdani\u2019s campaign.\nThe latest campaign finance filings show that after the election, some of those donors and others in the industry contributed to the mayor-elect\u2019s transition efforts, giving at least $40,900 between Nov. 5 and Nov. 30. That represents less than 2 percent of the $2.6 million Mamdani took in during that time.\nRepresentatives for Mamdani indicated that donations through Dec. 5, which go beyond the city\u2019s filing period, have reached more than $3 million. The funds, according to the representatives, help pay for staff and operations as Mamdani prepares to take office.\nThe real estate-related donations include anyone who identified themselves as working in development, construction, architecture, property management or brokerage.\nA number of these real estate donors previously gave to Mamdani\u2019s campaign, including Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman, who donated tens of thousands of dollars to a pro-Mamdani political action committee ahead of the election. Washington, D.C.,-area developer Joseph Kaempfer, developer Craig Harwood and LCOR\u2019s David Sigman all contributed to Mamdani\u2019s campaign ahead of the general election and also donated to transition efforts.\nFriedman and Kaempfer each gave $3,700, while Harwood gave $2,000 and Sigman $250.\nAlbany-based developer Faraz Khan and New Jersey investor Mustafa Ladha each contributed $3,700.\nJRT Realty\u2019s Jodi Pulice, who donated $400 to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s mayoral campaign before the primary, contributed $2,000 to Mamdani\u2019s transition. JRT previously worked as a subcontractor on the city\u2019s commercial leases, which became the subject of a\nlegal fight\nthis year.\nIn May, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services issued a request for proposals\nseeking up to five brokerages\nto represent the agency on leasing and buying office properties.\nTwo weeks ago, Mamani\nnamed\n24 people to his transition committee on housing. Members hailed from housing organizations, unions, Yimby groups, tenant groups and private real estate companies. We don\u2019t yet know who the mayor-elect will tap to lead the city\u2019s housing-related agencies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who would you like to see lead the Department of Housing Preservation and Development? City Planning? The Department of Buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Housing groups warn that\nfour bills\nthat set various requirements for city-funded housing would increase the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs by $545 million per year. In a letter to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Council member Rafael Salamanca, who chairs the Committee on Land Use, the New York Housing Conference, Citizens Housing and Planning Council and others urged against passing Intros. 958, 1433, 1437 and 1443. Three of the bills set citywide minimum percentages for city-funded housing, creating floors for the amount of homes affordable to extremely and very low-income tenants, two- and three-bedroom units and homeownership units. Another caps the percentage of studio apartments built in senior housing projects.\nThe housing groups argue that those measures, along with a separate bill that would set minimum construction wages on certain city-funded projects, would increase HPD\u2019s budget needs by $1.3 billion. Supporters of the wage bill, known as the Construction Justice Act, have objected to estimates of that bill\u2019s cost, saying that they grossly overshoot the potential added cost.\nThe clock is ticking for all of these bills, as the last City Council meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Port Authority police captured a horse at the entrance to JFK\u2019s Terminal 1 on Sunday night, after receiving reports that the runaway animal was seen on the JFK Expressway,\nGothamist reports\n. The equine, known as Sundance, had escaped from Curly\u2019s Cowboy Center in Southeast Queens, located less than a mile from the airport.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama, will move into Gracie Mansion next month. \u201cThis decision came down to our family\u2019s safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$21 million\nfor a condominium unit at 70 Vestry Street. The Tribeca condo unit is 3,200 square feet and last sold in 2023 for $15.5 million.\nCompass\u2019\nJared Schwadron has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$488.4 million\nfor 35 Hudson Yards. Related Companies and Oxford Properties sold a 38-story portion, which includes retail, office and hospitality space, to Japan\u2019s Mori Trust,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10.8 million for a condo unit at 1165 Madison Avenue. The 2,700-square-foot condo at The Bellemont last sold in 2023 for $8.8 million.\nCompass\u2019\nDane Gray and Caleb Loftus have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 92,273-square-foot, nine-story mixed-use building at 1383 Brooklyn Avenue in East Flatbush.

        "content": "Mendel Deutsch of Toms River, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty to one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for his role in a brazen commercial mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn.\nDeutsch pleaded guilty in November, just a few weeks after one of the co-conspirators, Joshua Feldberger of the title insurer Universal Abstract, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.\nThe Department of Justice accused Deutsch and Feldberger of assisting in a scheme with Arthur Spitzer to buy and sell properties and obtain mortgages on properties they did not own.\nProsecutors alleged Spitzer orchestrated the scheme in 2019 and 2020 by identifying properties in New Jersey or Brooklyn without mortgages or mortgages below the property\u2019s market value. The trio would make it appear like Spitzer owned three properties in Brooklyn and had agreed to sell them to Deutsch, who then took out a $4.5 million loan on the transaction, according to the DOJ.\nThe scheme involved multiple bad acts: The defendants allegedly created and sent letters stating that Deutsch had deposited escrow funds to close on the transaction, created fake documents showing the properties transferred to Spitzer and lied to the mortgage lender, stating Universal received more than $2 million from Deutsch at closing, causing the lender, Connect One Bank, to fund the loan.\nDeutsch\u2019s plea comes amid a crackdown by the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency into mortgage fraud. The agencies are targeting deals in which the borrowers sold properties to related parties or inflated building financials to obtain larger loans than they otherwise would have received.\nBut the scheme at the heart of the allegations against Spitzer, Deutsch and Feldberger is particularly bold since Spitzer and Deutsch never owned the properties. Deutsch even used the fraudulent loan proceeds to fund an actual down payment on the same properties.\n(The Brooklyn properties were owned by entities tied to Dahlia Kalter, civil court records show. Kalter\u2019s husband is Mark Nordlicht, who ran the infamous hedge fund Platinum Partners and was found guilty of securities fraud by a jury in New York federal court and given six months of house arrest.)\nDeutsch also fraudulently obtained about $1.8 million of government loans intended for small businesses during the pandemic. The businesses tied to these loans had little or no operations. He also submitted false statements about the number of employees, revenues, cost of goods sold and lost rents, according to prosecutors.\nAt a hearing in November in which Deutsch pleaded guilty, he told U.S. Judge Edward Kiel in Camden, New Jersey, that the highest level of education he had completed was the eighth grade. He stated his last job was as a salesman selling doors and hardware, which he held for 18 years.\nDeutsch, 39, faces a maximum sentence of up to 50 years and a maximum fine of $1.25 million, although he will likely be sentenced to far less. Deutsch is scheduled to be sentenced on March 16, 2026.\nSpitzer has pleaded not guilty.\nAn attorney for Deutsch did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Amityville is pumping the brakes on its apartment boom.\nAfter a half decade of rapid multifamily growth, village officials want a six-month moratorium on new apartments, condos and townhomes while they study whether the surge has pushed local services to a breaking point, Newsday\nreported\n.\nThe proposed pause would block approvals or construction of any building with three or more units, Mayor Michael O\u2019Neill said. The village of about 10,000 people has the option to extend the moratorium another six months if needed and is set to take public comment Monday at Village Hall.\nAmityville\u2019s wave of development was encouraged in part by a $10 million Downtown Revitalization Initiative grant from the state in 2022, which included increased rental housing as a pillar of that revitalization.\nBut the buildout moved quickly: the village has added 500 new multiple \u201cdwelling units\u201d in the past five years, which amounts to a 20% increase over the total number, according to the proposed legislation. More than 300 came online in 2023 at AvalonBay Communities\u2019 Broadway complex.\nAvalonBay floated a second luxury building across the street while the first project was still leasing up, but scrapped the idea after local pushback. Even so, O\u2019Neill said developers continue knocking and the village keeps uncovering five to eight previously unregistered rentals each month. The moratorium, he said, is meant to \u201cmake sure we don\u2019t oversaturate the village.\u201d\nThe pressure isn\u2019t theoretical. Soon after the AvalonBay complex opened, village police and fire crews responded to nearly two dozen false alarms tied to what the developer described as construction glitches.\nOfficials also say they need better data \u2014 on occupancy, rents, traffic and infrastructure impacts \u2014 to gauge how the influx of renters is reshaping the village. Officials plan to tap internal staff and hire an outside firm through a request for proposals to run that analysis.\nResidents say the pause is overdue. Joan Donnison, president of the Bay Village Civic Association, told the outlet she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the proposal and said the village is at \u201ca tipping point\u201d as it tries to balance revitalization with quality of life. She credited the housing influx for boosting downtown energy but said the community needs a clearer picture of how much more it can absorb.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

But instead of knocking down the price \u2014 the logical move for stuck sellers \u2014 Baldwin is raising it.\nThe actor\u2019s home at 355 Town Lane in the Hamptons community is back on the market for $21 million, Newsday\nreported\n. The property was taken off the market a little more than a year ago, when it was available for $19 million.\nIt would be natural to think the elevated price accompanies an upgraded offering, but that isn\u2019t the case, according to Saunders &amp; Associates\u2019 Scott Bradley, the listing agent for the 10-acre estate.\nThe biggest development appears to be the home\u2019s role in a TLC reality show detailing the family lives of Baldwin, his wife and their children. But even seeing Baldwin at the home is not unprecedented for viewers, since he\ncut a two-minute video\nin early 2024 trying to hawk the home.\nBaldwin purchased the estate in 1995 for $1.7 million. Since then, he\u2019s made two additions, bringing the property\u2019s main home to 9,000 square feet. The property is approved for the construction of another home of similar size, as well as expanding the existing five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house.\nOther features of the home include two upper-level balconies, a wood-paneled library, a wine-tasting room and movie theater. The backyard features a pool with a spa, surrounded by a pavilion and stone fireplace. There\u2019s also private beach access.\nBaldwin listed the property in September 2022 for\n$29 million\n. At the start of 2023, he\ncut the price\nto $25 million, before reducing it again two months later to $22.5 million and then down to $19 million before it was taken off the market.\nIn other Baldwin dealings, the actor and his wife, Hilaria, sold their lake house upstate in 2022 for $530,000. He was also reportedly shopping his\npenthouse in Greenwich Village\nin Manhattan last year.\nRural life is the life for the Baldwins, it seems: the couple bought a 55-acre farm in Arlington, Vermont, for $1.7 million several years ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Other downtown property investors will likely be spooked by the selloff, which could trigger a domino effect, some insiders told the Journal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really heartbreaking signal to other owners in the central business district,\u201d Norman Miller, a real estate professor emeritus at the University of San Diego, told WSJ. Despite the national office market showing some signs of a comeback, much of the activity is centralized in major cities like New York and\nSan Francisco\n.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the San Diegos of the world fit that bill,\u201d Dylan Burzinski, a research analyst at real estate advisory firm Green Street, said.\nA spokesperson for Irvine Company said that the firm is still investing in San Diego, but is shifting its focus to other higher-growth markets in the city, such as La Jolla and University Town Center, as it leaves downtown. \u201cInvestment activity is shifting toward stronger submarkets,\u201d commercial real estate firm Kidder Mathews said in its third-quarter report cited by WSJ.\nIrvine Company began snapping up well-known office towers in San Diego in 2003 and eventually became the city\u2019s biggest office landlord. At the time, San Diego\u2019s economy was in the midst of growing beyond the defense industry as demand for high-quality office space increased. But with the onset of the pandemic and widespread adoption of work-from-home policies \u2014 and subsequent slow\nreturns to office\n\u2014 the local market began to suffer.\nThe firm started selling off parts of its six-building downtown San Diego portfolio last year. In October, it completed its exit with the\nsale of One America Plaza\n, the city\u2019s tallest building, for $120 million \u2014 more than 50 percent below Irvine Company\u2019s $300 million purchase price for the 650,000-square-foot property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The other two that Zurich bought were a 131,000-square-foot building in the\nCherry Creek area of Denver\nthat fetched $52 million, and the 50,000-square-foot building at 58 Charles Street in Cambridge outside of Boston.\n\u201cIf you can pick these really interesting nodes inside these markets that have a dynamism and vibrancy, you can see where there is traffic and people returning to the office. We\u2019re trying to pick the right nodes,\u201d said Sean Bannon, head of U.S. real estate for Zurich, which has its North American headquarters just northwest of Chicago in\nSchaumburg\n.\nHe said Zurich wants to get back into the San Francisco office market, where it lost some bids to buy property earlier this year. It previously owned and operated a portfolio of boutique office buildings in San Francisco during the 2010s that it sold in late 2019, just before the pandemic rocked values. He wants to return to the market with a purchase in 2026, he told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are finding a lot to like about office pricing in premium locations in good markets, particularly the discounts to replacement cost,\u201d Bannon said, adding it bought all three offices without using debt to fund the purchases.\nThe Chicago deal consists of a 32,000-square-foot building that L3 bought back in 2019 and since remodeled into a modern office building, with Live Nation as its anchor tenant. L3 paid a total of more than $19 million for it, along with the building at 932 West Randolph Street. It bought the properties from Fifth Third Bank, which closed branches in the buildings after it acquired MB Financial. The $19 million purchase also included a parking lot at 1020 West Lake Street.\nL3 used a $13.8 million construction loan from CIBC that it took out in 2022 to redevelop the building at 1020 West Randolph, property records show. The total cost of the project isn\u2019t clear, and L3 didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nL3 has been a serial investor in Fulton Market\n, where it also teamed up with LaSalle Investment Management on the popular\nTime Out Market food hall\non Fulton Market Street. The partners sold it in 2023 for $35 million to the wealthy Italian family of the global spirits brand Campari Group.\nPhair and Lanni\u2019s firm also has investments in the\nGold Coast\n, Lincoln Park, Lakeview and State Street in the Loop, among other out-of-state markets such as New York City and Miami.",

        "content": "A vacant retail property on Chicago\u2019s State Street sold at a steep discount, a sign of\nthe corridor\u2019s\ncontinued struggle with high vacancy and declining values.\nCalifornia\u2011based lender Calmwater Capital sold the eight\u2011story, 112,495\u2011square\u2011foot building at 213\u2011227 South State Street for $2.8 million,\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business reported\n, based on information from brokerage SVN Chicago Commercial, which represented the seller. The property has sat empty since Foot Locker closed in 2020.\nThe sale follows other bargain transactions along State Street, including an $8.3 million deal at State and Madison streets\nin October\n.\nThe sale represents a major financial loss for Calmwater, which took control of the building in 2023 through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Sterling Organization, the previous owner which has other\nChicagoland retail woes\n, surrendered the property rather than pay off an $18.3 million mortgage. Calmwater did not comment on the deal.\nThe buyer, Downtown Islamic Center, took the opportunity to acquire a property to accommodate its growing congregation. The mosque already owns a building at 231 South State Street and had long sought additional space. Chairman Mohammed Kaiseruddin said the new facility will expand services for downtown congregants, including Sunday school for children, adult religious education and interfaith activities.\nBroker Ross Modjeska of McCaffery Interests, who represented the mosque, noted that given current market conditions, such deals are rare, and the organization was fortunate to act quickly.\nSVN Chicago Commercial brokers Chad Schroedl and Scott Maesel represented Calmwater in the deal.\nThe transaction highlights the challenges facing Chicago\u2019s Loop retail market. Nearly five years after the onset of the pandemic, downtown foot traffic remains depressed, remote work has reduced downtown activity and vacancy rates hover at about 26 percent, according to Stone Real Estate. These conditions have driven down property values, creating opportunities for buyers with local market knowledge. However, in the\nChicagoland suburbs\nretail has found a solid footing in tandem with residential development.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

The\nSan Francisco\n-based environmental group Pacific Forest Trust sold the land for $2.4 million, or $2,678 per acre.\nThe Mariposa-based tribe purchased it using funding from the California Natural Resources Agency, which has a program to help tribes acquire land.\nThe property has one house on it and was previously zoned for up to 19 ranchettes.\nThe Pacific Forest Trust bought most of the land in 2004 from a family that had owned it since 1925.\nThe trust intended to expand Yosemite National Park to the original boundaries proposed by John Muir in the 1880s. That proposed expansion was supported by the Mariposa County Board of Supervisors and the superintendent of Yosemite.\nLocated near the intersection of Wawona and Glacier Point Roads, the acreage is packed with cedar, white fir and sugar pine trees with views across the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Merced River.\nThe Southern Sierra Miwuks were driven out of the area in the 1850s as soldiers, settlers and miners moved into the Yosemite area during the\nGold Rush\n. The Ferguson Fire in 2018 charred parts of the property; the Pacific Forest Trust replanted 125,000 native trees to help restore it and began discussing a potential sale with the Southern Sierra Miwuk.\n\u201cHaving this significant piece of our ancestral Yosemite land back will bring our community together to celebrate tradition and provide a healing place for our children and grandchildren,\u201d said Sandra Chapman, tribal council chairwoman of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. The land will be used as \u201ca sanctuary for our people,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s the latest land transfer deal in California as more\nNative American tribes\nwork in tandem with environmental groups and state agencies to recover land that was once theirs. In May, the state completed the\nlargest-ever transfer of land\nto a Native American tribe in California history when the Yurok Tribe, using $56 million in funds raised from public and private sources, acquired a 47,100-acre parcel of land along the lower Klamath River, including the Blue Creek watershed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The multifamily market in Oakland continues to face anemic property values, as evidenced by the two latest deals for apartment properties in the East Bay city. The deals are part of a broader wave of multifamily foreclosures and below-assessed sales that has swept the Bay Area for much of the year.\nArtHaus Partners and Belay Investment Group foreclosed on a loan that gave them ownership of nine apartment complexes totaling 268 units in Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt area for a total of $30 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The $30 million purchase amount, or about $111,940 per unit, is 68 percent lower than the combined assessed value of the nine residential properties as of this January, per Alameda County Assessor\u2019s Office data cited by the Mercury News.\n\u201cThe combination of being in the early innings of a tech cycle and the Oakland market having bottomed out makes this the ideal time to invest,\u201d Riaz Taplin, founder and CEO of ArtHaus Partners, said. The company\u2019s \u201cnear-term priorities include stabilizing the assets by renovating and leasing the currently vacant units.\u201d\nIn a separate deal, South Bay investors Krishna Koganti and Seetaram Vemulapalli spent $21 million for the 83-unit Amelia apartment complex in Pill Hill after a lender previously foreclosed on the multifamily property. In October last year, SREC Amelia Owner foreclosed on the loan that financed The Amelia apartments; at the time, the unpaid debt totaled $23 million. The purchase by Koganti and Vemulapalli was at 8.7 percent less than its debt in last year\u2019s foreclosure; on a per-unit basis, the transaction works out to about $253,000 per residence \u2014 a low per-unit price for East Bay apartments this year.\nIn October, Madison Realty Capital began the\nforeclosure process on The Fay\n, a 363-unit, 23-story apartment tower in San Jose, after its developer Murro defaulted on a $182.5 million construction loan. That property opened to residents late last year. And in July, the University Park apartment complex in Berkeley\nheaded to a foreclosure auction\nafter Academy West Investments\ndefaulted on payments\ntied to the apartment complex.\nElsewhere in the East Bay, in August, an Abacus Capital Group affiliate paid $98.3 million for the 259-unit\nPark Central Apartments\nin Concord, working out to $379,500 per unit, or a total property value 24.7 percent lower than its assessed value of $130.5 million.\nThe\nAtrium Downtown apartments\nin Walnut Creek sold to a Fresno-based investor group led by Valley Yellow Pages CEO Siegfried Fischer, which bought the 78-unit property from Sequoia Equities for $31 million \u2014 down 3.4 percent from the complex\u2019s most recently assessed value of $32.1 million for a per-unit price of $397,400.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Tetra Technologies\u2019 current headquarters is at a seven-story, 171,000-square-foot office building at 24955 Interstate 45 North. It was built in 2008.\nNewmark\u2019s David Baker, Elliott Hirshfeld and Kristen Baker are the leasing agents for San Francisco-based Spear Street. Tetra Technologies was represented by Flatrock Commercial Real Estate Group\u2019s Caleb Lawson.\nTetra Technologies will occupy space in the South Tower of the two-building, 564,000-square-foot office property. The campus was built in 2014, and is about 26 miles north of downtown Houston. It\u2019s also home to Expand Energy, which has a full-building lease at the 279,000-square-foot North Tower.\nSpear Street bought 1000 Energy Drive in 2019, deed records show. It was valued at $142.7 million for property tax purposes in 2025, according to appraisal district data.\nHouston\u2019s battered office market\nis continuing its slow recovery, logging a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the third quarter. That number increased to 639,000 square feet, Newmark reported, bringing the year\u2019s total net absorption of office space to 1.2 million square feet. Partners Real Estate put the market vacancy at 26.3 percent at the end of the third quarter, a slight dip from the previous quarter.\nThere\u2019s a bright side to the distress that\u2019s befallen Houston\u2019s aging office buildings. Valuations have dropped for these older properties to the extent that buying is more appealing than leasing for some office users. As a result, the number of\nowner-user deals\nhas risen, providing a much needed boost to the sluggish market.\n",

        "content": "Everyone knew\nthe switch from 421a to 485x would mean fewer large multifamily projects.\nTurns out, it\u2019s not as bad as expected. It\u2019s worse.\nThe new tax abatement has not merely reduced the number of mixed-income projects with 100 or more units. It has eliminated them.\nSince the state enacted 485x in April 2024 with a wage floor for projects with 100 or more units \u2014 at the behest of construction union leader Gary LaBarbera \u2014 exactly zero such projects have registered for the program.\nFourteen of the 180 projects seeking the abatement would have exactly 99 units, but the average unit count is only 31, according to an analysis by the Real Estate Board of New York of the\nlatest data\n(through October 31). Of the 5,546 total units, just 350 will be in Manhattan.\nClearly, the housing crisis has no end in sight.\nWhen it comes to housing supply, large projects carry the freight \u2014 even with the de facto cap imposed by 485x. The program\u2019s 99-unit projects make up just 8 percent of the buildings but 25 percent of the units.\nUnder the expired 421a, projects of 100 or more units yielded 59 percent of the homes, the NYU Furman Center\nfound\n.\nHowever, some 100-plus-unit projects are still being built in New York City. Because of the way all-affordable housing is funded and taxed, it pencils out without the 485x property tax break and is not subject to 485x\u2019s union-friendly wage floor.\nThis might sound like a good thing to activists who want more affordable and less market-rate housing built. But they are wrong.\nThe supply shortage can only be fixed if both affordable and market-rate development are firing on all cylinders. Reducing the latter does not produce more of the former. They are different animals. Shrinking the elephant population does not increase the mouse population.\nAffordable projects typically require piecing together a bewildering array of funding sources \u2014 Low Income Housing Tax Credits, project-based vouchers, grants and loans from city, state and federal agencies, foundation money and more.\nThis Syracuse project\nhas at least seven.\nThe timelines are longer because of the bureaucracy involved. The fee structure is different, as are the buildings themselves. For example, rooms in affordable housing must be larger. And units are rented via housing lotteries, not a standard leasing office.\nMany developers don\u2019t build affordable housing for the same reason that brain surgeons don\u2019t do knee replacements. Instead, they do certain kinds of projects again and again, allowing them to gain expertise, increase efficiency and reduce risk.\nLast month I ran into a developer who builds\nlarge multifamily projects\nbut only as-of-right. He has no experience with rezonings and doesn\u2019t plan to try one. Another firm, after a\ncontroversy\n, sticks to\nrehabbing empty buildings\n.\nNothing has been gained by stopping developers from building large, market-rate projects and the investors and lenders who fund them. All New York City is getting is less housing.\nAn activist might ask: Doesn\u2019t 485x\u2019s de facto ban on 100-unit projects allow affordable developers to outcompete market-rate ones for larger sites? Not really.\nIn many neighborhoods, rents are high enough that developers of sub-100-unit, 485x projects win the bidding for parcels zoned for more than 99 units. Sometimes they plan two or three \u201cseparate\u201d sub-100-unit projects, avoiding the 485x wage floor.\nEven if these midsize projects dried up, affordable development would still be limited by finite subsidies and the capacity of agencies that administer them.\nThe real estate industry and YIMBY groups need to get this message to Albany, and fast. The state legislative session kicks off next month and ends in early June. If 485x\ndoesn\u2019t get fixed\nby then, it\u2019s \u201cWait \u2019til next year,\u201d as Brooklyn Dodgers fans used to say.\nThey should explain that expanding 485x beyond 100 units won\u2019t snuff out all-affordable projects, which in some areas are the only ones that pencil out.\nConsider the Jay Group\u2019s attempt to\ndefy the odds\nand build a mostly market-rate project under 485x\u2019s predecessor (421a) at 2886 Atlantic Avenue in East New York. The developer couldn\u2019t lease enough market-rate units at the rents it needed ($2,500 to $3,000 for one-bedrooms), so it sold the project to Camber Property Group and the nonprofit Institute for Community Living, who turned it into a subsidized, all-affordable project.\nIf I were a civic-minded developer, I wouldn\u2019t rely on REBNY or lobbying firms to make the case. I\u2019d meet with as many Assembly and Senate Democrats as possible, so when they conference with chamber leaders to decide on an agenda, 485x has a shot to be included.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll remain stuck at ground zero.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the inaugural edition of Erik Engquist\u2019s newsletter Reality Check, which aims to cut through the political spin and rhetoric that plague the real estate industry.\n",

The 37\u2011acre mixed\u2011use project is designed to transform the area with 880,000 square feet of office space, 238,000 square feet of retail, 1,785 apartments and a 175\u2011key hotel.\nThe first phase of construction is expected to begin in early 2026 and finish by 2028. Fort Worth City Council already\napproved incentives\nin June, including a Chapter 380 grant and tax increment financing for FW Westside RE Investors, with grants spread over 15 years. The developers are now seeking additional support from the Near Westside TIF District.\nIn Texas, TIF financing leverages the increases in property value to fund infrastructure projects. Infrastructure at the Westside Village project will include roads, utilities and streetscaping.\nTo qualify for the incentives, developers must meet strict requirements. The first phase must involve at least $410 million in investment, with $311 million in hard construction costs spent by the end of 2030. Minimum build\u2011out requirements include 200,000 square feet of office space, 95,000 square feet of retail and a hotel with at least 150 rooms.\nWestside Village is one of several megadevelopments in Fort Worth. The list includes Brown Ranch from\nHines\nand Goldenrod Company\u2019s\nVan Zandt project\n.\nBass, the billionaire nephew of late oilman Sid Richardson, has decades of experience developing houses and commercial buildings. His Keystone Group, named for the West Texas oil field where the family made its fortune, has holdings in securities, real estate, oil and gas.\nLarkspur Capital\u2019s current multifamily development projects include the 155-unit Victoria Row, 240-unit\nSanta Fe Trail Lofts\nand 190-unit The Willows, all in Dallas.

        "content": "At his Douglas Enclave apartment building in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, developer Henry Torres cut rents for some of the 199 units. Yet, his bottom line took no hit.\nAfter completing the project in 2023, Torres decreased annual rates by an average of $3,000 and recouped the loss through a roughly $4,500 property tax break per reduced unit awarded by the\nLive Local Act\n. The total: about $450,000 in savings from his $950,000 tax bill this year.\nThe rent break also helped him fill the building faster. Amid South Florida\u2019s stubbornly persistent and pervasive\naffordability crisis\n, tenants are on the hunt for a reprieve.\n\u201cIt definitely got a lot more smiles on people\u2019s faces. I can tell you that. People are struggling right now, especially the blue collar class,\u201d said Torres, founder of the Coral Gables-based Astor Companies. \u201cIt helped us tremendously to get units rented faster.\u201d\nHe\u2019s no anomaly. South Florida apartment developers and landlords seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that incentivizes landlords to include\nworkforce\nunits at their buildings. Although much of the industry buzz has been over the law\u2019s main perk for\nlarger projects\n, its less touted bonus \u2013\u2013\nproperty tax breaks\n\u2013\u2013 is already reshaping the multifamily market.\nUnder the legislation, landlords who finished projects in the past five years and designate at least 71 units as workforce or affordable get a carrot: a 75 percent tax abatement for apartments reserved for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the area median income, and 100 percent tax relief for apartments for tenants earning less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nAcross South Florida, at least 48 properties qualified this year, according to data provided by the property appraisers for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Many weren\u2019t planned as Live Local and were built before the law existed, and the developers brought the apartments under the state law\u2019s purview retroactively to tap into its tax breaks.\nIt came at a critical time. Over the past two years, demand slowed compared to recent years\u2019 boom, requiring concessions, and costs increased across the board.\n\u201cDevelopers are looking at projects and saying, \u2018Alright, property insurance is going up, property taxes are going up. How do we offset things?\u2019\u201d said Matthew Scott, a Greenspoon Marder land use and zoning attorney. \u201cThey run the math and Live Local gives the tax benefit, so that\u2019s less money they have to pay.\u201d\nLive Local math\nCoral Rock Development Group completed the 204-unit Metropolitan in Coral Springs last year, a dicey time for multifamily.\nAfter years of record in-migration and rent growth, developers jumped on the bonanza with new projects. By the time they completed a record\n18,600 mostly market-rent units\nlast year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, the influx of out-of-staters had slowed and some transplants had\nreturned home\n.\nLease-ups slowed.\nCoral Springs wasn\u2019t as overbuilt with apartments as other submarkets, but Coral Rock still converted Metropolitan, planned as market-rate apartments, to workforce via Live Local. The building reached full lease-up this fall with roughly 160 apartments for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, charging about $350 less per month than market-rate units at the Metropolitan.\n\u201cWe determined through metric analysis that we would accelerate leasing and not lose money,\u201d said Coral Rock\u2019s Michael Wohl. \u201cYou need to lease-up faster and stabilize faster, so you can be eligible for permanent financing.\u201d\nFor the math to pencil out, landlords ensure tax savings offset reduced rents. The delta between market rents and workforce rents can\u2019t be too big, a condition far more common in suburbs far from the glitz of coastal neighborhoods that command top rates.\nOut of the 28 Miami-Dade properties that received a Live Local tax break this year, 19 are in suburban areas. Hialeah, a western city that\u2019s traditionally been a bedroom community offering cheaper housing, is home to nine.\nIMC Equity Group\u2019s Carlos Segrega said Live Local won\u2019t work for properties in Coral Gables.\n\u201cThe income demographics are higher,\u201d Segrera said. But \u201cif the market [rent] is at $3,000 and you can lease it at $2,700 \u2026 now the pro-forma pencils.\u201d\nAt IMC Equity\u2019s 340-unit\nThe Upland in Hialeah\n, about 80 units qualified for the abatement, Segrera said.\nAt other Hialeah properties, the market rent already is at the rate for earners of 120 percent of the AMI. Such was the case with the 260-unit\nPura Vida Hialeah\n, which Coral Rock qualified for the tax break before selling it earlier this year.\n\u201cYou are not losing money on the rents, and correspondingly, you are getting the abatement,\u201d Wohl said. \u201cSo you\u2019d be an idiot not to.\u201d\nWorkforce rentals specialist Affiliated Development received the tax break on four properties this year, without lowering rents since it already developed them underwriting below-market rates. The abatement covered unexpected increases in overhead.\n\u201cIt was necessary because of the dramatic spike in operating cost. Insurance doubled. Materials, for when you turn a unit, skyrocketed,\u201d said Nick Rojo of Affiliated. \u201cIt really helped offset those costs.\u201d\n\u201cA business to run\u201d\nThe tax reprieve comes with hurdles.\nLandlords said they try to lease as many units as possible to earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, but also can\u2019t turn away prospective tenants with higher incomes. Qualifying for the Live Local tax break can be an administrative headache. The workforce rents are based on the lower of either the rent outlined by the Florida Housing Finance Corporation or 90 percent of the market rent in the area of their project.\nLandlords have to collect tax returns or paystubs from households to confirm their incomes meet the workforce threshold.\nAnother kink is that lenders still don\u2019t recognize the tax break.\n\u201cFannie and Freddie, which is 85 percent of the permanent [financing] market, do not recognize Live Local savings, so it\u2019s really hurt people from the total financing they could get,\u201d said Alex Ruiz of Prestige Companies, which received tax abatements on four Hialeah properties this year. \u201cIf they were going to give me $10 million for a project, and with Live Local I should be able to qualify for $14 million, it doesn\u2019t matter to them. They [still] give me $10 million.\u201d\nWhile the tax breaks are bad news for counties and municipalities that rely on the revenue, developers argue it\u2019s a necessary tool for them to provide the same level of service and quality to the workforce.\nSouth Florida\u2019s affordability crisis isn\u2019t lost on landlords.\nAt her 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\nin Miami\u2019s Allapattah, developer Lissette Calderon got the tax break after reserving some apartments for the workforce, offering one bedrooms below $2,000 a month and two bedrooms in the low $2,000. These rates are \u201cunheard of in today\u2019s market,\u201d she said, adding the tax break has allowed her Neology Group firm to continue offering a coveted lifestyle with amenities like yoga classes. Otherwise, higher expenses would have dented budgets, leaving Neology with no choice but to raise rents, Calderon said.\n\u201cThis has allowed us to continue to maintain the rents we were hoping to maintain and continue that aspirational living to the engines that drive our community,\u201d she said, referring to the workforce.\nTorres, too, is cognizant renters are struggling, saying it\u2019s become normal for many South Floridians to pay half of their incomes for housing instead of the commonly accepted 30 percent, He is considering applying the Live Local tax break to some of his projects on tap.\n\u201cI have a lot of sympathy for people struggling, but I have to make sure our building makes money,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe have a business to run, too.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sotheby\u2019s International Realty landed the Walters | Plaxen Group, which packed up its seven-person team and a hefty inventory list from the Beverly Hills Estates, TRD has learned.\nThe group, which has handled more than $220 million in Los Angeles real estate sales so far this year, will be based out of the Sotheby\u2019s offices in Beverly Hills and Miami.\nThe Walters | Plaxen with career sales in excess of $1 billion, is the latest big get for Sotheby\u2019s, which earlier this year recruited\nErnie Carswell\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Carswell brought his 15-person team, Ernie Carswell &amp; Associates, to Sotheby\u2019s in May with the agent referring to the brokerage in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nat the time as being at the \u201ctop of its ilk,\u201d adding\u00a0 \u201cmy team and myself now want that type of solid track of consistency and longevity.\u201d\nCristian David, Sotheby\u2019s Southern California region executive vice president, said the brokerage\u2019s global brand is a big selling point to agents.\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s strongest professionals \u2026 want a brand that understands this marketplace\u2019s nuances, anticipates global wealth shifts and equips them with world-class tools and mentorship,\u201d David told TRD.\nWalters said as much in a statement, calling out the brokerage\u2019s \u201cglobal ecosystem.\u201d\n\u201cAs wealth expands across continents, we\u2019re expanding with it,\u201d she said.\nPlaxen added that \u201cunlocking new markets\u201d also factored into the decision to move their licenses over to a global brokerage to keep step with the movement of high-net-worth clients.\nWalters | Plaxen also includes Brooke Enwere, Christian Garcia, Yona Lador, Necole Hilbert and Milan Ciro.\nMarket \u201cstandout\u201d\nThe team brings a strong track record that has continued this year, when it joined with Beverly Hills Estates founders Branden and Rayni Williams to represent the buyers of Melhill Estate in Brentwood for $53 million in October. Walters | Plaxen also had a hand in the sale of 1414 Donhill, which was purchased by Fashion Nova\u2019s Richard Saghian for $32 million in June, and provided representation of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the November sales of his two Palisades lots at 15303 and 15309 Friends Street for $6.1 million.\nAt the top of the group\u2019s inventory was the $108 million co-listing of 1200 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air, which was removed from the market late last week. There are plans for the team to re-list the residence, according to a spokesperson.\nThere\u2019s also 9330 Flicker Way in the Bird Streets, which is asking $68 million. They\u2019re set to list 1360 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills for $53 million, 1951 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air for $88 million and 556 Catalonia in the Palisades for $40 million. The group also holds listings in Las Vegas, Miami and Thailand.\n\u201cThe Walters | Plaxen team had their biggest wins while at the Beverly Hills Estates, including several record-breaking sales,\u201d brokerage co-founder and President Branden Williams said. \u201cDuring their time here, they became a standout team, so it\u2019s no surprise the corporate giants came calling. That\u2019s just not who we are. We\u2019re a boutique brokerage built on collaboration, transparency and a culture the big firms can\u2019t replicate. It\u2019s been an honor to fuel their growth and watch their trajectory take off.\u201d\nComings and goings\nIndeed, the team\u2019s departure marks a year of changes at For the Beverly Hills Estates.\nIt landed big names such as Jaqueline Chernov from Compass and recently announced its expansion into the Palisades with a new office called\nPalisades Estates\n.\nIt\u2019s also seen some other talent leave.\nIn March, Mick Partridge left the brokerage for Carolwood Estates, bringing with him two agents and a director of operations. Carolwood also poached the\nTavangarian team\n, helmed by Shana and Emila Tavangarian. The two are the daughters of famed ulra-luxe spec developer Ardie Tavangarian. With their move, they brought along their co-listing of Villa Siena at 607 Siena Way, which was designed by their father, and listed for $177 million. The listing was shared with the Williams but has since been taken off the market.\nMore recently, in July,\nMatthew Clayman\nleft the Beverly Hills Estates as its broker of record and general manager to oversee Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. Clayman\u2019s since been on a recruiting tear, with the brokerage announcing seven new agents, including\nSeverin Braham\n, former director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group at the Beverly Hills Estates.\n",

        "content": "Pulte Homes\npaid $14 million for the first phase of a townhome construction project at the former AT&amp;T headquarters redevelopment in Hoffman Estates.\nThe townhome construction is part of\nBell Works Chicagoland\n, a mixed-use development on the site of the\nformer telecom giant\u2019s headquarters\nin the northwest suburb of Chicago.\nInspired by Somerset\n, the site\u2019s developer, is partnering with Pulte Homes on construction of the residential portion of the campus, which will feature 164 townhomes. The developer is also planning a 300-unit apartment building on part of the residential portion of the site.\nPulte Homes spent the $14 million to purchase 87 lots from Inspired for the first phase of the townhome development on Nov. 3, according to public records. The lots are on the southern end of the residential site, which was previously undeveloped land to the east of the AT&amp;T campus.\nConstruction on the townhome site broke ground in March, and the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026. After making initial land improvements, the developers received approval from the city to begin applying for building permits for phase one of the two-phase project in November.\nThe north end of the site contains about 80 more lots for townhomes that are planned for construction after the first phase is finished.\nPulte Homes did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe townhome prices will start in the low $500,000 range, according to Pulte Homes\u2019 website. They\u2019ll range from 1,900 to 2,400 square feet. The homebuilder\u2019s website lists three design plans, ranging from three to four bedrooms and two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms. Each townhome will have a two-car garage.\nInspired by Somerset has developed the Bell Works site with the goal of establishing a \u201cmetroburb,\u201d an urban-style mixed-use development in the suburbs. The developer bought the 1.2 million-square-foot property at 2000 Center Drive in 2019 for $21 million.\nThe eastern portion of the building, covering 420,000 square feet, is 98 percent leased, a Somerset spokesperson said Monday. Tenants include offices, retail and coworking spaces. Somerset is also working on developing the west side of the building, which will open an additional 430,000 square feet of office and 70,000 square feet of retail.\nHoffman Estates planning officials will consider a change to the tax-increment financing agreement for the Bell Works project in a meeting on Monday. The new agreement would allow Somerset to keep 95 percent of TIF proceeds for 15 years, up from 10 years in the existing agreement. In the last five years of the agreement, the city and Somerset would split the tax proceeds evenly.\nPulte Homes has also been building elsewhere in the Chicago suburbs, including the planned Estates of Ravinia Meadow in Orland Park. That development will include 129 new homes, with prices starting in the mid $600,000 range.\n",

The buyer is a trust, and the only listed trustee is the buyer\u2019s agent, Genna Stolnik of Compass Real Estate.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but the Highland Park home is the most expensive residential sale in Texas this year, based on information compiled by the Houston Association of Realtors.\nCrousen listed the home in February, easily taking the first spot on the list of\nthe most expensive luxury homes for sale in Texas\n, compiled by HAR from the state\u2019s foremost Multiple Listing Services.\nSince then, the home has only been outstripped in asking price by the $64 million\nCrespi Estate\nin Dallas; the $60 million\nLodge at Hunters Creek\nin Houston; and a\nUniversity Park mansion\nformerly owned by the late Fortress Investment Group CEO Joshua Pack, asking $35 million. None has sold yet.\nSitting on more than an acre, the six-bedroom, 13-bathroom Euclid Avenue home boasts one of the largest lots in Highland Park, according to listing agent Jason Garcia of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate.\nBuilt in 2015 by architect Robbie Fusch, the traditionalist manor imported its limestone floors, corniced fireplace and bronze hardware from France. A basilica-style dome, gilt in 24-carat gold leaf, caps the grand foyer. Roman pillars support an arcade belting the courtyard, which includes a fish pond fountain, a swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen and a loggia. With almost 19,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $1,700 per square foot.\nFusch also designed the most expensive listing of 2024, a\n17,700-square-foot mansion on Strait Lane modeled after the White House\nfor investor Toby Neugebauer. The \u201cWhite House of Dallas\u201d left the market this summer, apparently unpurchased, according to Dallas County records.\nOut of the state\u2019s major metros, the only sale that might rival the mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue is a\nwaterfront compound on Westlake Drive\nthat recently sold with an undisclosed asking price somewhere above $20 million.\n",

JPMorgan Chase provided the financing, converting last year\u2019s\n$430 million bridge loan\ninto a five-year term.\nThe debt deal was first reported by\nCommercial Real Estate Direct\n. Iron Hound Management\u2019s Rob Verrone arranged the deal, which came about as the property stabilized with nearly 95 percent leased, according to Bistricer.\nThere are two units available on the property\u2019s\nwebsite\n: a studio apartment for $3,000 monthly rent and a one-bedroom unit for $5,300 monthly rent.\nClipper landed the bridge loan last May, months after topping out construction on the three-building complex. That debt retired a $386 million construction loan provided by the Bank of China and SL Green shortly into the pandemic.\nThe 799,000-square-foot property, unspooled along the East River, was designed by CentraRuddy Architecture. There are 230 affordable units, as well as 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a tennis court, a game room and a pet spa.\nSL Green provided Bistricer a $70 million loan when he acquired the site with then-partner Joseph Chetrit for $25 million in 2012. Seven years later, Bistricer bought Chetrit out of the project.\nOutside of Brooklyn, Bistricer has suffered alongside his competitors when it comes to rent-stabilized properties. In the spring, Clipper sold an 83-unit apartment building with rent-stabilized units in Lincoln Square\nfor $45.5 million\n, a deep discount from the $79 million purchase price in 2017.\nBack in Greenpoint, the Jay Group recently acquired the lot at 97 West Street from Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management\nfor $130 million\n. The developer also\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor a 590-unit rental project on the site.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The signage rule specifically was mocked by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which unveiled an eight-foot banner to show just how impractical it would be.\nThe pilot is meant to give owners in designated neighborhoods a 10-year path to legalize otherwise off-the-books units without triggering the state\u2019s tougher multiple-dwelling law. In theory, tenants could remain while owners incrementally bring their apartments up to code.\nBut advocates and attorneys say the fine print exposes owners to steep penalties and tenants to displacement if owners can\u2019t meet the conditions, a dynamic that could keep already wary homeowners from enrolling.\n\u201cThis rule\u2026 would ensure that no one registers and comes out of the woodwork because it\u2019s too risky,\u201d Citizens Housing and Planning Council\u2019s Howard Slatkin told the publication. Pratt Center policy director Sylvia Morse called the rules unworkable and warned that the program is set up to \u201cfail.\u201d\nThe stumbling blocks go beyond signage. The rules require an apartment to have a full kitchen with a window, utilities and proper hookups. But owners cannot legally pull permits to install those features without first having a legal unit; that\u2019s the kind of catch-22 that doomed the city\u2019s earlier basement pilot in East New York, where not a single homeowner made it through the process.\nHPD\u2019s companion regulations also raise questions about tenant protections. While existing residents would have a nominal right to return after construction, they must have lived in the unit since April 2024 and vacate within 30 days of notice from owners. Tenant advocates say that the timeline is unrealistic for low-income renters in a market with vanishing affordability.\nBasement apartments remain essential, if risky, housing for tens of thousands of New Yorkers. After Hurricane Ida\u2019s deadly flooding, the push to bring these units above board gained urgency.\nThe Adams administration has\npaired the pilot\nwith its \u201cCity of Yes\u201d zoning push to unlock accessory dwelling units citywide. But unless DOB and HPD rework the rules in response to public feedback, the city risks repeating its 2019 failure and leaving a major source of informal housing stuck underground.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The surge in popularity of\narena-anchored mixed-use developments\nhas a late Dallas icon to thank.\nTom Hicks, who died on Saturday at the age of 79, was a pioneer in sports real estate, foreseeing the success of districts that integrate sports complexes with other uses, like offices, retail and multifamily.\nKnown for perfecting the leveraged buyout, Hicks and business partner Bobby Haas made beverage industry history when they brokered the merger of soda companies Dr. Pepper and 7Up.\nHicks spun his success into a storied career in sports ownership. He owned the\nDallas Stars\nfrom 1995 to 2011; the team won the Stanley Cup in 1999. He owned the Texas Rangers from 1998 to 2010. He also had a 50 percent stake in Liverpool Football Club from 2007 to 2010.\nAs owner of the Stars, Hicks partnered with Ross Perot Jr. to usher in the development of Victory Park, the entertainment district across Woodall Rogers Freeway from\ndowntown\n. The pair developed American Airlines Center, which opened in 2001. It\u2019s the home arena for the Stars and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\u201cThat partnership we put together in the \u201990s to build the arena\u2026 truly transformed the city,\u201d Perot\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nToday, Victory Park is part of the growing headquarters of\nY\u2019all Street\n. It will soon be home to the\nnew Goldman Sachs campus\n, which will anchor Hunt Realty\u2019s NorthEnd development.\nWhen he purchased the Texas Rangers, Hicks also bought the 270 acres around The Ballpark in Arlington. He had similar dreams of building a mixed-use development anchored by the ballpark, but that didn\u2019t happen while he owned the team.\nDuring his ownership, the Stars and the Rangers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were sold at auction.\nHicks and his wife, Cinda, were owners of the iconic Crespi Estate in Dallas\u2019 Preston Hollow. It was built in 1938 for Italian Count Pio Crespi. The Hickses added a two-story guest house and a three-story pool house. The 27,000-square-foot estate at 5619 Walnut Hill Drive consistently ranks among t\nhe state\u2019s most expensive listings\nand has since been owned by banker Andy Beal and developer Mehrdad Moayedi.\nHicks\u2019 death drew condolences from fellow Dallas sports owner Jerry Jones, who said in a statement, \u201cBeing shoulder to shoulder with him was always more than ballparks and stadiums, though. It was about personal respect, trust and friendship.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Nvidia\n\u2019s Santa Clara headquarters campus is set to grow with another hexagonal building.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company submitted an architectural review with the City of Santa Clara to build a 692,634-square-foot building at 2300 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. Nvidia owns the site, as it does with other properties in the Santa Clara area it occupies.\nThe planned office building would resemble the hexagonal shape of its other signature headquarters buildings along San Tomas Expressway and Walsh Avenue. Those two geometric buildings \u2014 dubbed \u201cVoyager\u201d and \u201cEndeavor\u201d \u2014 are across San Tomas Expressway from 11 other Nvidia headquarters buildings and two parking structures. The new hexagonal building, like the buildings across San Tomas Expressway from Voyager and Endeavor, will be connected to the starship-like headquarters buildings at 2788 and 2880 San Tomas Expressway via a pedestrian bridge, according to planning documents filed with the city. Gensler, which designed the Voyager and Endeavor buildings, is the architect for the expansion project.\nNvidia\u2019s proposed office building will sit on a 13-acre site currently home to a 10-building office and research campus, which the company\nbought earlier this year for $123 million\n. It marked one of the largest property deals of the year in the city.\nThe chip-making giant, bolstered by the exploding growth of the\nartificial intelligence sector in Silicon Valley\nand beyond, has been on a real estate tear this year, dropping more than $400 million on property surrounding its neighboring Voyager and Endeavor headquarters buildings. In July, it purchased a nearby four-building office complex at 2740 Scott Boulevard for $4.5 million. And in September, it bought a 125,000-square-foot building it was leasing at\n2701 San Tomas Expressway\nfrom Sobrato for $83.2 million.\nIn May, the company filed plans to build a separate 324,000-square-foot structure at 2400 Condensa Street, behind Voyager and Endeavor across the San Tomas Aquino Creek, to house offices, lab space and parking.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s real estate moves have largely been concentrated near its Santa Clara home, the company has also been moving into new territory \u2014 namely, its\nfirst-ever offices in San Francisco\n. Last month, the Jensen Huang-led corporation finalized a lease agreement for 45,000 square feet at 1090 Doctor Maya Angelou Lane, known as Building B of the Mission Rock mixed-use development co-owned in part by Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The complaint and suggestion departments are open.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with members of the Association for a Better New York and the Partnership for New York City. There, he reassured developers, lenders and investors that he is always open to hearing from them.\n\u201cI [assured] that my door to their feedback, their concerns and into identifying areas of collaboration will always remain open,\u201d he said during a press conference after the meeting.\nThe meeting was initiated by the mayor-elect\u2019s transition team, which also scheduled a meeting with homeless advocates later on Tuesday. At the press conference, Mamdani said ABNY CEO Emma Pfohman, the Partnership\u2019s outgoing CEO and President Kathy Wylde and its incoming head, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, helped organize the meeting.\nRoughly 20 people met with the mayor-elect Tuesday morning, including Rob Speyer, CEO of Tishman Speyer and chair of the Partnership; Nadeem Meghji, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone; Priscilla Almodovar, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jed Walentas, CEO of Two Trees and chair of the Real Estate Board of New York; Carlina Rivera, a former City Council member who recently took the helm New York State Association for Affordable Housing; and Asahi Pompey, chair of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, according to Wylde.\nTenant organizer Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, was also in attendance.\nMamdani began the meeting by citing a comment he made to the\nNew York Times\nin June, that his view on the private market\u2019s role in housing construction had evolved, and he now recognizes the \u201cvery important\u201d part it plays.\nThe meeting then touched on a number of issues that Mamdani\nbroached\nat a previous meeting with the Partnership, including his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years and his support for overhauling the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u201cI spoke not only about my continued commitment to freeze the rent for more than two million rent-stabilized tenants, but also my commitment to asking and understanding the roadblocks that they have faced in building more housing across the city and how we can ensure deeper levels of affordability, how we can partner in advocating for the resources this city deserves from the federal administration,\u201d Mamdani said at the press conference.\nHe said he spoke to attendees about the importance of reducing the time it takes to lease up affordable housing units. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he was speaking specifically about units set aside for formerly homeless individuals, but the median time to lease up such units was 235 days in fiscal year 2025, according to the\nMayor\u2019s Management Report\n.\nWhen asked about four pending City Council bills that would add new\nrequirements\nto city-funded housing, Mamdani didn\u2019t take a position. Housing groups have\nwarned\nCity Council that passing the measures, which Wylde said did not come up during the meeting, would significantly increase the cost of building housing and lead to fewer units being built.\n\u201cMy focus is on building as much housing as we can across the city, and I will stay in conversation with the City Council on the proposals they put forward,\u201d Mamdani said.\nWylde said the group discussed the need to fund renovations of rent-stabilized apartments that are being kept off the market, though no specific ideas emerged. Still, she felt the meeting was \u201cvery constructive.\u201d\n\u201cHe was taking notes the whole meeting,\u201d Wylde said. \u201cI think he was listening and was very interested in what everyone had to say.\u201d\n",

The sentence could ultimately stretch up to 10 years.\nConover was\narrested\nin March following a police chase in his Jeep, according to court documents. A local police officer tried to de-escalate the situation after multiple attempted stops, only for Conover to drive into the cop, throwing him 40 feet, then embarking on another chase that was ended by state police.\nThe police officer ended up in the hospital with a leg injury.\nConover\u2019s appearances in court created more noise over his legal future.\nBefore his arraignment\n, Conover said that \u201cif anyone dares try to test my mental competence, I will eviscerate every single person with my intelligence right now.\u201d He also claimed to be the victim of a police sting.\nAfter a closed-door competency hearing and a 30-day stint at a mental health facility, Conover was deemed competent for trial. In September, however, his attorney filed a notice of insanity defense, arguing before sentencing that Conover had bipolar disorder and suffered from a manic episode during the March incident.\n\u201cThis is not the outcome I hoped for, and not the outcome that reflects the severity of what happened,\u201d Bartlett Police officer Cameron Emmett said in a victim impact statement. \u201cA police officer being run down during the course of duty is not a minor incident.\u201d\nConover\u2019s YouTube channel showcases ultra-luxury listings across New York City, Aspen and Miami, among others.\nThe 36-year-old launched his internet fame as a travel vlogger, then\nventured into real estate\nafter collaborating on a listing video with Ryan Serhant in 2018. After obtaining his real estate license two years later, he joined Nest Seekers and received $100 million in listings from the firm\u2019s chief executive officer, Eddie Shapiro.\nConover is no longer licensed with Nest Seekers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "After the pandemic fueled an industrial building boom, developers are finding buyers for newly completed projects.\nThe development arm of Transwestern, known as Transwestern Development Company, last week sold a 255,000-square-foot distribution center in the Chicago suburbs to an Asian food wholesaler for $33.5 million, public records show. The sale price equates to $131 per square foot.\nThe buyer was JFC International, which is based in Los Angeles, according to the property\u2019s latest deed.\nThough total development costs are unclear, Houston-based Transwestern likely did well on the sale. The company bought the land for the property at 4101 Canterfield Parkway East in West Dundee for $2 million in 2022 and took out a $21 million construction loan from Comerica Bank shortly afterward, according to Kane County public records. No other loans have been publicly recorded against the property, which is known as the TDC I-90 Logistics Center.\nThe property likely benefits from Chicago\u2019s robust rail network as well as its proximity to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The distribution center is about 20 miles from O\u2019Hare and 40 miles from downtown Chicago.\nThough\nfears of oversupply in Chicago\u2019s industrial market\nwere percolating last year, by the halfway point of this year, absorption rates began to tell a different story.\nIn the second quarter, speculative industrial\ndevelopment overtook built-to-suit projects\nfor the first time since early 2024, according to NAI Hiffman.\nAt the same time, the region saw an absorption rate of 1 million square feet, indicating leasing activity is still outpacing vacancies, NAI Hiffman found. The region\u2019s vacancy rate has hovered between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent since 2024.\nPending and recently completed sales indicate supply is still matching demand, even if activity has slowed somewhat since a pandemic-era peak.\nOn Chicago\u2019s Southwest side, local firm Bridge Industrial is under contract to buy Ford City Mall with a $150 million plan to demolish the 960,000-square-foot shopping center and\nreplace it with a four-building logistics complex\nspanning 913,000 square feet.\nExisting properties have been trading, as well.\nHouston-based Hines earlier this year\nbought a distribution center at 555 Saint James Gate\nin suburban Bolingbrook for $29.5 million, or about $73 per square foot. Seller TradeLane Properties had purchased the 404,000-square-foot facility in 2021 for $24.6 million.",

        "content": "The Quad, a newly redeveloped office and retail campus in Uptown Dallas, secured a $228.2 million refinancing.\nJLL Capital Markets represented Stream Realty Partners in arranging the five\u2011year senior loan, which replaces a prior $181 million construction loan for the site\u2019s redevelopment, the\nDallas Business Journal reported\n. An affiliate of New York\u2011based investment firm KKR provided the financing, with a deed of trust recorded Nov. 11 confirming the deal between KREF Capital, the real estate investment arm of KKR, and owner SRPF B Quadrangle Property, a unit of Stream Realty. The company has major holdings in\nHouston\nand\nAustin\n.\nOpened in May 2024, The Quad spans two office buildings and six standalone retail structures at 2828 Routh Street and 2699 Howell Street in Dallas. Its centerpiece is a 12\u2011story, 345,000\u2011square\u2011foot office tower that was about 80 percent leased as of September.\nTenants include M Financial Group, Revantage, Berkshire Residential, LDWW, Chicago Title and law firm Perkins Coie. The campus also features a renovated 500,000\u2011square\u2011foot legacy office building.\nBeyond office leasing, The Quad has a vibrant retail and dining scene. Michelin\u2011starred Mamani opened in September, joining Australian caf\u00e9 Two Hands, Korean\u2011Japanese restaurant Domodomo K\u014d, and Michelin\u2011recommended Written by the Seasons. Bread Club, an upscale bakery, is slated to open by year-end, while LDU Coffee launched its sixth Dallas site on the campus this summer. These establishments surround an acre of landscaped green space.\nStream Realty, run by CEO Chris Jackson, acquired the former Quadrangle in 2019 with the vision of transforming the aging site into a modern hub. Redevelopment began in 2022, backed by the original $181 million loan.\nThe refinancing signals lender confidence in urban office campuses, despite other challenges in the office market. The Quad has benefited from its position near other\ntrophy Uptown developments\nsuch as the 26\u2011story 23Springs. Although Uptown has emerged as a\ndowntown-like district\nfor Dallas tenants, it has managed to avoid the fate of legacy downtowns with their vacant office towers and dwindling foot traffic post-pandemic.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

The buyers borrowed $34.5 million from U.S. Bank.\nThe price amounts to $288 per square foot.\nJacaranda Plaza consists of three one-story buildings completed in 1974 and 1999 on 16.2 acres, Vizzda records show. It was renovated in 2013.\nAside from Publix, the shopping center also is anchored by Ross Dress for Less. Other tenants include Five Below, Planet Fitness, Dollar Tree and nurse registry Value Care At Home.\nAn entity tied to Epic \u2013\u2013 led by Daniel Holland, Jason Maddox and Nick Tortorice \u2013\u2013 had paid $29.3 million for the plaza in 2016, Vizzda records show. In 2022, Epic and Heitman formed a joint venture through which Epic recapitalized five properties, including Jacaranda Plaza, according to a joint news release issued at the time.\nCore, a retail investment firm focused on Southeast markets, primarily Florida, owns and manages a portfolio of about 2.5 million square feet, its website shows. Led by Adam Greenberg and Michael Lapointe, Core has been a frequent investor in South Florida.\nIn August, Core and Spectrum Business Ventures sold the Aldi-anchored Palmetto Plaza at 15905-16341 Northwest 57th Avenue in Miami Gardens at a discount for\n$22.5 million\n. The buyer assumed the\n$22.5 million\nloan on the property, which Core and Spectrum had purchased for $33.6 million in 2020, records show.\nIn 2022, Core paid\n$44.8 million\nfor the Deerwood Town Center at 11905 Southwest 152nd Street and 12107 Southwest 152nd Street in Miami-Dade County\u2019s West Kendall neighborhood.\nResnick\u2019s investments include the Kendall Marketplace at 11531-11631 Southwest 88th Street in Kendall, which he bought for\n$32 million\nin 2022.\nIn other recent grocery-anchored sales, Boca Raton-based Carlyle Management and an entity managed by Edward Rutkovsky bought Royal Eagle Plaza at 9100-9190 Wiles Road in Coral Springs last month for\n$60.5 million\n. The center is anchored by Aldi, Hobby Lobby and Petco.\nSan Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group paid\n$118.4 million\nin September for the 150,600-square-foot retail portion of the Uptown Boca mixed-use development at\u00a0 20940 Uptown Avenue near Boca Raton. The plaza is anchored by Whole Foods Market.\n",

It was Los Angeles County\u2019s priciest listing last week, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe weekly report, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, looks at new listings and signed contracts listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe Beverly Park mansion, located in a gated community where business titans and celebrities reside, sits just a few steps from 71 Beverly Park Lane, which\nParis Hilton\nand husband Carter Reum paid\n$63.1 million\nfor in June.\nThe latest neighborhood listing first went up for sale last May in hopes of nabbing nearly $90 million. It was taken off the market in March.\nThe speculative development is owned by Paradigm Developers\u2019 Todd DeMann, according to property and state records. Paradigm built the property with Harrison Design and Mike Moser Studio.\nThe developer dreamed up nearly every luxury, including a primary suite running about 5,000 square feet, screening room, two kitchens, home office, outdoor kitchen and fruit tree orchard.\nBuyers also have the option of snapping up the adjacent parcel, which has approved plans to build an equally expansive mansion of about 29,000 square feet at 74 Beverly Park Lane. Combined properties would span 4.5 acres.\nCompass\u2019 David Kramer and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton hold the listing.\nElsewhere last week, Eklund Gomes reported 705 Palisades Beach Road in Santa Monica as last week\u2019s top home to go into contract.\nThe nearly 4,000-square-foot residence has four bedrooms and five bathrooms with an asking price just under $16 million, or $3,991 per square foot.\nIt hit the market in late October and is listed by Pardee Properties\u2019 Colette Stevens.\nProperty and state records show the home is owned by a limited liability company, managed by Sherri Conn in Fort Worth, Texas. An individual of the same name and Texas address tracks to the CFO of family office Wildcat Partner Holdings and is also vice president of property management firm Tarrant Management.\nThe Santa Monica residence touts about 60 feet facing the beach, outdoor dining, a pool and elevator.\nIt also comes with a link to Hollywood history, with the home once owned by late actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks. \u201cThe Mark of Zorro\u201d and \u201cRobin Hood\u201d actor established film production company United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith in 1919.\nMarket pulse\nOverall, last week\u2019s signed contract activity in the county showed a rebound from the past few weeks\u2019 doldrums.\nThe Eklund Gomes team reported 19 signed contracts equating to $143.3 million in volume. That\u2019s 10 more contracts and a spike of nearly 170 percent in volume compared to a year ago.\nForty-five homes were either listed or re-listed last week, which brought the market\u2019s total inventory to 1,204 properties, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n.\nDespite the week-to-week swings, a measure of dealmaking in the third quarter showed the County\u2019s high end on the up.\nThird-quarter closings jumped 21 percent year-over-year to 497 trades for L.A. County properties listed in the MLS for $4 million or more, according to data compiled by Westside Estate Agency. Volume in that same period rose 25 percent from the year-ago period to $784.4 million.\n",

        "content": "A newly formed tenants union\u2019s request for leniency from eviction was denied by Cook County Judge Debra Ann Seaton at a hearing on Monday.\nThe case involves residents of the apartment building at 7500 South Shore Drive, the site of a dramatic immigration raid in September. The tenants union requested $7,500 in relocation assistance and 60 additional days to vacate after the current deadline set for this Friday,\nBlock Club Chicago reported\n.\nSeaton denied the motions, siding with plaintiff Wells Fargo in its foreclosure case against property owner Trinity Flood.\nDespite Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s support for the tenants\u2019 requests, Seaton insisted residents had already been offered aid and emphasized the building\u2019s dangerous conditions, citing gas leaks, plumbing failures and reliance on portable heaters.\n\u201cIt would be inhumane for this court not to relocate people as quickly as possible,\u201d the Cook County judge said.\nSam Barth, an attorney representing the union, argued residents wanted to leave but could not secure leases on such short notice, warning that eviction risked homelessness. Seaton responded she was not making anyone homeless and criticized Barth\u2019s language as \u201ctriggering.\u201d Seaton ordered tenants to\nleave the building\nlast month.\nControl of the property had already been transferred to receiver Jared Friedman after Flood failed to address hazards. Friedman testified his company posted eviction notices and offered residents $5,000 in relocation payments \u2014 $2,500 upfront and $2,500 upon departure. Twelve tenants accepted, though organizers said the offers came with pressure to decide quickly.\nSeaton praised Friedman as an \u201cactively engaged receiver,\u201d dismissing union complaints that he avoided meeting with them.\nThe dramatic U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement raid took place in September, filmed by federal agents. It brought attention to conditions inside the building. A foreclosure lawsuit from Wells Fargo\nlaunched prior to the raid\n.\nThe incident raised legal questions\nfor landlords\nand put Neenah, Wisconsin-based Trinity Flood\nin a spotlight\n.\nAbout 30 residents remain members of the union in a building with 130 units. The union has decided to support tenants in accepting Friedman\u2019s offer, while supplementing assistance through its own fund.\nYet residents stressed that the money does little to solve the immediate crisis. Malfunctioning elevators, leases unavailable on short timelines and the sheer difficulty of moving in winter compound the challenge.\n\u201cFinding placement is the issue,\u201d said tenant leader Darren Hightower.\nFellow resident Raymond Corona lamented that despite following rules, he must relocate within days, hauling belongings through snow.\nOrganizers framed the plight as emblematic of the city\u2019s housing crisis, with some suggesting crowdfunding as a last resort.\nFriedman confirmed plans to lock the building Friday, promising scheduled access to retrieve\u00a0 belongings.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

One\nproposal calls for 1,800 apartments\nat the 3.6-acre Safeway site in the Fillmore District; another outlines 366 homes at the Bernal Heights Safeway location, as well as 532 units at the Outer Richmond Safeway. Last week, Safeway and Align filed\nplans for 790 apartments\nat the Safeway site in the Marina District.\nThose aren\u2019t all the Safeways in the city that could be redeveloped into mixed-use properties, according to the Business Times. Safeway, headquartered across the Bay in\nPleasanton\n, also has stores on a 1.2-acre site at 735 7th Avenue in the Inner Richmond; another 1.2-acre site at 2350 Noriega Street in the Outer Sunset; and a 0.8-acre site at 625 Monterey Boulevard in Sunnyside. The company also owns a handful of small parcels making up part of the surface parking lot for its store at 2020 Market Street.\nWhether the grocer, which is part of Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, plans to pursue\nsimilar residential-above-grocery projects\nat those sites remains to be seen.\n\u201cSafeway is constantly evaluating locations to better serve the neighborhoods of which we are part and to provide customers with a convenient, modern shopping experience that meets their needs,\u201d the company told the Business Times regarding the redevelopment of other stores in the future.\nWith 3,488 units already planned, Align has largely reached its goal of putting 3,500 apartments into San Francisco\u2019s housing stock at a time when the city needs it. San Francisco is mandated by the state to build 82,069 new units by 2031 under its\nhousing element\n. As more tech and artificial intelligence workers flock to the city, demand for apartments and\nrent prices\nhave been on the rise.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The trust and LLC are registered to law firms, masking their true owners.\nThe mansion spans about 8,400 square feet and sits on a 1-acre lot.

Angle did not immediately return a request for comment, and Pope declined to comment.\nAcross\nPalm Beach County\n, deal signing for luxury properties has been picking up after the Thanksgiving holiday. The priciest home that went into contract was for a 23,000-square-foot mansion at\n118 Bears Club Drive in Jupiter\n, which had an asking price of $44 million. The residence has seven bedrooms and nine and a half baths and sits on a 3-acre lot.In Palm Beach, the most expensive listing to hit the market this season is for an oceanfront estate at\n1491 North Ocean Boulevard\n.

        "content": "New Yorkers who own real estate \u2014 even a single townhouse \u2014 might be headed over a cliff.\nI\u2019m talking about the estate tax.\nIf a New Yorker with a net worth of up to $7,717,500 dies in 2026, the first $7.35 million is\nnot taxed\nby the state. But if an estate is worth more than 5 percent above that exclusion threshold, the entire estate is taxed.\nTax professionals call that a cliff.\nNew York\u2019s estate tax rate starts at 3.06 percent and rises quickly, topping out at 16 percent for estates worth more than $17.25 million. People worth that much have likely done some estate planning, or at least thought about it.\nIt\u2019s New Yorkers who don\u2019t consider themselves wealthy, but who have had a home and a 401(k) for a while, who tend to be shocked when they realize how the state will tax what they leave behind.\nThe impact of going over the precipice is severe. At the edge of the cliff, a $7,717,500 estate would pay a tax of just $49,980 \u2014 only 0.6 percent. An estate worth $1 more than that is over the cliff and would pay $734,580 \u2014 a hefty 9.5 percent. The difference between those two tax bills is $684,600.\nFrom a policy perspective, how does it make any sense that dying with a single extra dollar would cost your heirs $684,600? Perhaps state lawmakers really want to motivate New Yorkers to reduce their net worth.\n(There is no federal estate tax cliff. Plus, the federal exemption amount is absurdly high. An individual who dies with $14 million pays no federal estate tax.)\nIf you live in an $8 million townhouse with no mortgage, avoiding the cliff will be difficult. You could sell or mortgage the house and give away some of the money, but be warned that non-charitable gifts made within three years of your death will be clawed back into your estate by Albany.\nAnother option is to donate your home to charity with a life estate, meaning you can keep living there until you die, at which point the charity gets it. This immediately removes the home from your estate and also provides an instant income tax deduction that can be carried forward as needed.\nDonating the house also guarantees that your heirs won\u2019t fight over it when you\u2019re gone. But that kind of thing\nnever happens\n, right?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf COPA (Community Opportunity to Purchase Act) passes and nonprofits buy a bunch of apartment buildings, the buildings would no longer have to pay property taxes. Has anyone mentioned the potential impact of the bill on city revenue?\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city does not allow buildings\u2019 lighting \u2014 such as that on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new skyscraper at\n270 Park Avenue\n\u2014 to display advertising or company branding.\nElsewhere\u2026\nTwo landmarked buildings are close enough to Extell Development\u2019s project at 655 Madison Avenue to sell air rights to it: 781 and 790 Fifth Avenue.\nBut only 790 Fifth can do so, says PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry, because 781 Fifth \u2014 the Sherry-Netherland co-op \u2014 is overbuilt. It has been there since 1927.\nBarnett is also getting 129,000 square feet of development rights in return for making improvements to the Fifth Avenue/59th Street subway station. Those improvements will benefit his building and the public at large.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a 2,488-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.2 million\nfor a 13-unit apartment building at 2923 Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Central Harlem.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27 million\nfor a 5,475-square-foot condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nile Lundgren of Serhant has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 64,675-square-foot, 74-unit project at 191 Canal/17 Cedar Street in Stapleton. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Zeldy Roth.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub, Daniel Fromm and Sam Speciale arranged the debt.\nThe 16-story, 170-unit development opened in March, featuring one- to three-bedroom apartments. The property has six units available, according to\nStreetEasy\n, ranging from a $3,200 one-bedroom unit to a $5,600 two-bedroom spread.\nThere are 60 affordable units within the complex, built with the since-lapsed 421a affordable housing tax abatement. There\u2019s also 45,000 square feet of commercial space, divided into eight separate units.\nAmenities include lounges and dining areas, an outdoor deck with pergolas and a barbecue area, a fully furnished roof deck and a fitness center.\nThe mixed-use development replaced the famed Trylon Theatre, a movie house that opened during the 1939 World\u2019s Fair and stayed in place until its demolition three years ago. Design aspects of the development, like its terra cotta features, pay homage to its Art Deco past.\nMore recently, it was home to Ohr Natan Synagogue and the affiliated Center for New Americans, a Bukharian community center involved in a\nlegal dispute\nover rent about a decade ago. It appears the synagogue and community center ultimately relocated to the other side of Queens Boulevard.\nElsewhere in Rego Park, entities linked to the LeFrak Organization recently sold two multifamily properties at 65-44 Saunders Street, known as The Tennessee, and 63-60 98th Street, known as The Washington, for a total of\n$33.3 million\n. LeFrak had owned the properties for decades; the buyer was the State Preservation Housing Development Fund Corp.\nRun by Michael and Rudy Abramov, RJ Capital made news last year when it partnered with Uri Mermelstein and Joseph Yushuvayev of Top Rock Holdings for a\n$125 million construction loan\nto build upon a vacant lot next to a shuttered Forest Hills hospital, where they\u2019re planning a 241-unit luxury condo complex.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

An affiliate of Houston-based Hines sold the 82,241-square-foot newly built building for about $40.7 million, or approximately $495 per square foot. Robinson Pharma is paying for the building in part with a $30.4 million loan from an unidentified source, according to the Business Journal.\nRobinson\u2019s buy marks the largest property acquisition for the company to date, adding to its collection of eight\nindustrial buildings\nthat it either owns or leases, totaling nearly 1 million square feet. Most of those properties are situated along Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana. The latest purchase on Fairview is about 1 mile from the company\u2019s headquarters at 3330 South Harbor Boulevard.\nHines\npurchased the 3.9-acre site\nat 3130 South Fairview through its\nHines U.S. Property Recovery Fund\nnear the end of 2021 for more than $20 million. The location was previously used as a storage yard for recreational vehicles. The firm subsequently built the industrial facility, completing construction in 2023. The building has 5,000 square feet of office space on the first floor and 5,000 square feet of offices on the mezzanine level.\nRobinson has grown its operations in the Orange County area throughout the year.\nIn April, the company announced an expansion of its manufacturing capabilities that included the addition of 10 new softgel machines to its production lines, which \u201csolidif[ies] its position as having the largest softgel manufacturing capacity in the United States,\u201d\naccording\nto a statement from the company.\nRobinson Pharma was founded in Santa Ana in 1989.

Kansas City-based NorthPoint originally purchased the properties from Greenfield Partners in 2017, financing the deal with a $69 million acquisition loan later assigned to Nationwide Insurance, which was set to mature last month.\nThe portfolio, completed in 2002 and 2003, spans 88.6 acres and includes four facilities, according to Yardi Matrix. They include: Commerce Park Building 1 at 2924 East 126th Street (384,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 2 at 12525 South Carondolet Avenue (247,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 3 at 12519 South Burley Avenue (460,417 square feet); and Chicago Campus Building 4 at 3400 East 126th Street, the largest at 547,200 square feet.\nThe properties feature clear heights of 28 to 30 feet, dock\u2011high doors, grade\u2011level access, single\u2011load configurations and ESFR sprinkler systems. Together, they provide more than 1,000 small\u2011vehicle parking spaces and more than 150 trailer positions.\nTenants include Flex\u2011N\u2011Gate, Dakkota Integrated Systems, Troy Design and Manufacturing and Ford Motor Company.\nSituated along the Calumet Corridor, the buildings are near Ford\u2019s historic Chicago assembly plant.\nThe loan follows another financing from New York Life. Earlier this year, NorthPoint acquired a 2.8 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nChicagoland portfolio\nin a $270 million deal, supported by a $178 million loan from the insurer, maturing in 2032.\nEven with\noversupply\nand economic slowdown, Chicagoland\u2019s industrial market has proven\u00a0 resilient. Sales volume surpassed $2 billion year\u2011to\u2011date through October, ranking seventh nationally and second in the Midwest behind Detroit, based on Yardi Matrix data. Average sale prices in the metro stood at $90 per square foot, well below the U.S. average of $136, making Chicago the second\u2011lowest nationally after Kansas City. Asking rents have held up\nas well\n.\nNorthPoint Development, founded by CEO Nathaniel Hagedorn in 2012, operates in the Chicago and\nNew York metro\nmarkets.",

The project is part of a city\u2011backed initiative to transform outdated office towers into residential units, with requirements that at least 30 percent of apartments be affordable.\nYet the landmark designation has sparked debate among preservationists, highlighting tensions between redevelopment and architectural heritage. The tower replaced Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler\u2019s Chicago Stock Exchange Building, demolished in 1972 in a move widely criticized and credited with galvanizing Chicago\u2019s preservation movement.\nChicago Sun-Times architecture critic Lee Bey called it \u201can ironic twist\u201d that landmark status is now being considered for what he described as a \u201cnondescript\u201d replacement. Designed by Thomas Stanley, the tower incorporates New Formalism elements such as vertical columns and granite cladding, but many view it as uninspired compared to Sullivan\u2019s ornate original. Chicago Architecture Center CEO Eleanor Gorski argued the case underscores the need for consistent preservation standards.\n\u201cWhen preservation rules appear either arbitrary or inflexible, it invites uncertainty, and uncertainty almost always undermines investment,\u201d she told CoStar News.\nGolub and Corebridge acquired the property through\nforeclosure\nin 2023 and aim to make it one of the first major Loop office\u2011to\u2011apartment conversions. A smaller\nprecedent exists\nat the building at 79 West Monroe Street, where eight floors are being converted into 117 apartments.\nGolub principal Lee Golub acknowledged the tragedy of Sullivan\u2019s building\u2019s demolition, which claimed the life of preservationist Richard Nickel, but emphasized the importance of reviving\nthe office district\n. Plans include new windows, building systems, outdoor amenities and the return of urban farming company Farm Zero.\n\u201cWe need to move forward, and 30 North LaSalle is a vital project in the rejuvenation of the LaSalle Street financial corridor,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

That puts most of the growth in the\nsouthern\nand eastern suburbs of the city.\nThe strength of the market was further underscored by data from the San Antonio Board of Realtors. Despite an 11 percent decline in October home sales to 2,639 properties, the median price held steady at $305,000, and inventory stood at 6.04 months \u2014 conditions described as balanced by local brokers.\n\u201cWhile sales have slowed, steady pricing and strong inventory levels give both buyers and sellers more flexibility,\u201d Sabor Chairman Ed Zapata noted.\nThe current dynamic marks a reversal from 2022, when Austin significantly out\u2011built San Antonio.",

The incumbent top architect, Nikolai Katz, had his filings explode to 61 this year from 15 last year.\nBut dig a little deeper, and the numbers show a different phenomenon \u2014 one that appears to be entirely driven by the city\u2019s affordable housing tax abatement, 485-x, which was rolled out in April 2024.\nThe abatement requires projects building over 99 units to pay construction workers the prevailing union wages, resulting in the complete elimination of large projects using the city\u2019s tax abatement program.\nInstead, there have been a series of smaller projects that allow developers to stay under 100 units \u2014 and lead to more permits for architects.\nFor example, Katz has five projects with more than one permit filed for work being done on the same block. Combining the total number of units of each set of permits would yield over 100 units every time.\nThe numbers back up what architects have described for much of the past year.\n\u201cPeople are looking for smaller deals \u2014 clients that used to build 500-unit buildings are now looking at 100-unit buildings or less,\u201d Ben Grunwald, JFA chief operating officer and partner,\ntold The Real Deal in May\n.\nAside from the impact of 485-x, 2025 showed an industry that is getting back to work. In the third quarter of this year, there were\npermits filed for 11,746 multifamily units\n, a 69 percent increase from the prior quarter and the highest total since the first quarter of 2022.\nRead below for more about the most active architects filing those permits. The 2025 ranking is based on the number of initial permit applications filed for new buildings and renovations and reflects the architect of record through Dec. 1 on projects of at least 10,000 square feet. The methodology differs from the one\nTRD\nuses for its\nannual rankings published during the spring\n.\nNikolai Katz | 61 applications | 2.4M sf\nNikolai Katz once again claimed the top spot as the city\u2019s most active architect. His business has continued to benefit from its orientation in the outer boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx, which have accounted for over 78 percent of the more than 5,800 units proposed under 485-x, according to data from the Real Estate Board of New York.\nIn the Bronx alone, Katz is responsible for 36 permits covering 2,352 proposed units, including a set of 99-unit buildings on Mt. Hope Place. Katz\u2019s one permit for a building with more than 99 units is at 30-17 12th Street in Astoria, Queens, where he is working on a nine-story building spanning over 98,000 square feet that will yield 124 units.\nLeandro Nils Dickson Architect | 32 applications | 1.2M sf\nFor the second straight year, Leandro Nils Dickson Architect secured second place on the list of most active architects.\nSimilar to Katz, the architect specializes in midsize projects in the outer boroughs. The largest project filing for the architect is a more-than 70,000 square foot project in the Bronx on Marion Avenue which is expected to yield 45 units. Steven Westreich of Westorchard Management is listed as the owner behind the applications.\nDXA Studio | 18 applications | 440K sf\nDXA Studio has its fingerprints on a number of high-end condo developments across the city, including Avdoo\u2019s 105-unit project called Bergen, but its filings as the architect of record this year are based in the outer stretches of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.\nIts one Manhattan-based filing is for a 54-unit development from Lipa Engel at 47 East 30th Street that will rise 21 stories and span roughly 36,000 square feet.\nNode Architecture | 17 applications | 577K sf\nFounded in 2010 by Jakov Saric and Radomir Delic, Node Architecture did not appear on the list of top architects at all last year when the firm had just five filings for a total proposed square footage of roughly 85,000.\nThis year, Node has a single project spanning more square feet than that, an 11-story mixed-used building in East Harlem spanning over 101,000 square feet. The project will yield 96 residences.\nNode\u2019s other major project is taking place on East 167th Street in the Bronx, and is split across two buildings, one of which will yield 98 residences and the other of which will yield 85 residences. The total combined square footage of the project will be almost 139,000 square feet.\nKao Hwa Lee Architects | 17 applications | 1.2M sf\nDespite not having a website, Kao Hwa Lee Architects has made its presence felt in the city with a number of projects over 50,000 square feet. The firm has also gotten in on the 99-unit boom with over 33 percent of its 17 filings for 99-unit buildings.\nThe largest of those is an 88,000-square-foot project in Williamsburg on North 8th Street which will rise 17 stories. The architect\u2019s smallest project by unit count is a 29-unit mixed-use building at 31 Church Avenue in Brooklyn, which will have commercial, residential and community space.\nJFA Architects &amp; Engineers | 17 applications | 1.3M sf\nJFA may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the industry\u2019s pivot to multiple sub-100-unit projects. The firm submitted six separate applications for buildings under 100 units on 165th Street in Queens in July for a project that will in total deliver 591 units across over 450,000 square feet.\nThe firm also submitted applications for neighboring buildings in Long Island that would yield a combined 166 units spanning over 160,000 square feet.\nGerald Caliendo Architects | 16 applications | 285K sf\nGerald Caliendo Architects has the honor of being the representative with the smallest average project size on the list, with its 16 applications covering an average of just over 24,000 square feet.\nIts largest proposed project spans over 65,000 square feet in Kew Gardens, Queens, and would yield 57 residential units. The firm has also taken on a number of alterations this year.\nS. Wieder Architect | 15 applications | 946K sf\nS. Wieder Architect fell to eighth from third last year, despite filing five more applications this year. Its largest filings are for a pair of 99-unit buildings at 230 and 234 Clarkson Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens for developers Shlomo Karpen and Louis Handler of Keren Star Management. The site had previously been marketed as able to hold a single project of more than 150,000 square feet, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nBadaly Architects | 14 applications | 421K sf\nNima Badaly launched his eponymous firm in 1988, and works alongside his two sons, Shahin and Shakib, who serve as an engineer and architect, respectively.\nBronx-based Badaly Architects, launched by Nima Badaly in 1988, is loyal to its borough. Every one of the firm\u2019s applications is for projects in the Bronx. The largest is a 99-unit project at 2748 Jerome Avenue spanning almost 70,000 square feet.\nGensler | 11 applications | 2.4M sf\nGensler arguably has claim to the most renowned projects on this list, reflected by its millions of proposed square feet across just 11 applications.\nAll but one of the filings are for alterations, which speaks to how Gensler has also managed to corner the office-to-residential segment of the market. Its largest project involves converting roughly 760,000 square feet of office space at 750 Third Avenue into 680 apartments for SL Green Realty.\nGensler is also behind InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 571-unit conversion project at\n30 Broad Street\n, Vanbarton Group\u2019s 440-unit conversion project at\n6 East 43rd Street\nand Metro Loft and David Werner Real Estate Investments\u2019 464-unit conversion project at\n675 Third Avenue\n.",

        "content": "The Downtown Austin building that houses Shiner\u2019s Saloon is slated for demolition, according to paperwork approved by the city last week.\nThe property, with a three\u2011story, 13,254\u2011square\u2011foot building at the corner of West Fifth Street and Congress Avenue spans two parcels at 422 Congress Avenue and 101 West Fifth Street, both owned by Los Angeles\u2011based Karlin Real Estate, the\nAustin Business Journal reported\n. . While the site plan review has been completed, city records show that a formal demolition permit has not yet been issued.\nKarlin, which\nlisted the properties\nfor sale in late 2024, declined to comment, and Shiner\u2019s Saloon management could not be reached by the Business Journal.\nThe site\u2019s redevelopment potential is significant, though Karlin has not disclosed future plans. A portion of the 422 Congress Avenue property lies within a Capitol View Corridor, which imposes height restrictions to preserve views of the Texas Capitol. However, most of the land is outside the corridor, allowing for taller construction with a staggered design.\nCurrently, the Austin City Council has capped downtown tower heights at 350 feet under a\ntemporary measure\npassed in October. Developers can exceed this limit if they participate in the Downtown Density Bonus Program and secure city council approval.\nThe site has long been eyed for redevelopment. Merritt Development Group once proposed a $170 million, 36\u2011story AC by Marriott hotel with 340 rooms and a 5,500\u2011square\u2011foot restaurant, but withdrew from the project in 2024.\nThe properties also carry historical significance. They were part of Nate Paul\u2019s World Class Holdings\nportfolio\nbefore Karlin acquired them. Karlin has since redeveloped other World Class properties, notably transforming the former 3M campus in Northwest Austin into a 1.1 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nlife science campus\n.\nThe demolition marks the latest step in reshaping Austin\u2019s downtown landscape. With a prime location, flexible zoning potential and evolving height regulations, the site could become a major redevelopment project, though its future remains uncertain until Karlin or a new owner reveals concrete plans.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Tech CEO Jody Glidden paid $4.8 million last month for a new home in Biscayne Park, a small town that\u2019s sandwiched between Miami Shores and North Miami.\nGlidden, who is dating \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d cast member Lisa Hochstein, bought the tropical modern home after selling his waterfront Hibiscus Island home\nfor $11.9 million\nlast year. But he\u2019s not planning to live in the house; instead, he said he will rent it out. And he\u2019s looking for more properties in the village that he can purchase and redevelop, he told\nThe Real Deal.\nHis purchase in Biscayne Park marks one of a handful of deals that have set records for the village, as wealthy buyers increasingly seek proximity to private schools like Miami Country Day School, which recently secured approval for a renovation/modernization of the campus, and the Cushman School.\n\u201cBrand-new construction modern houses are breaking barriers in these alternative neighborhoods,\u201d said luxury broker\nDora Puig\n, owner of Luxe Living Realty. Puig compared price growth in Biscayne Park to what happened in neighborhoods like\nMorningside\nand Belle Meade. She called it a testament to the demand for private schools, as parents don\u2019t want to spend hours in traffic.\nGlidden, founder of software companies Introhive and Postilize, picked up a canalfront home that spans nearly 6,000 square feet with six bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms on a half-acre lot. The price amounts to $800 per square foot.\n\u201cAreas like Biscayne Park still offer pretty good value. If you want to make a decent multiple on your property, it\u2019s harder to do now in other parts of [Miami],\u201d Glidden said.\nThe developer, a partnership with Aaron Butler of Avenue Real Estate and Kobi and Nancy Karp, paid $1.4 million for the lot in 2022. Butler, who also brokered the sale, said the proximity to Miami Country Day, the village\u2019s curb appeal and low crime rate attracted him to invest.\n\u201cI would develop [in Biscayne Park] again. We\u2019re looking,\u201d Butler said.\nAt least two other newly built houses have sold in recent months in the same price range as Glidden\u2019s purchase. The house had been sitting on the market, but because Glidden paid cash, the deal served as a catalyst for additional sales, creating a comparable deal that appraisers can use.\nButler said it\u2019s a \u201ctransitional time\u201d for the community.\nPuig recently brokered the $5.3 million sale of the four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom house at 967 Northeast 117th Street. The 4,355-square-foot house was built on a third of an acre. An affiliate of Pintos Residential, led by Rodrigo Pintos and Roberto Lopez, sold the property to an LLC managed by an attorney in late November.\nThe property previously sold for $450,000 in 2021.\nA month earlier, a couple paid $4.6 million for the 4,860-square-foot, six-bedroom and seven-and-a-half-bathroom house at 740 Northeast 120th Street. A developer LLC led by Daniel Jaramillo sold the newly built house, which also sits on a third-acre lot. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Juan Zuluaga represented the seller, and Andrea Tavella with Vella Real Estate brought the buyers.\nThe lot previously sold for $750,000 in 2022.\nMiami Country Day, one of the top private schools in South Florida, recently secured approval to revise its master plan to include more properties that the school owns and to raise the height of some planned buildings to three stories, instead of two, said Francisco Garcia of the Euclid Group. The land-use consulting firm is working on the expansion of Miami Country Day\u2019s upper and middle school campus. The project calls for a new dining center, improved traffic flow and green space.\nThe school also recently opened a $20 million fitness and wellness center.\n\u201cWithout question there is\nexceeding demand for educational facilities\nin Miami-Dade County, particularly in the private school sector,\u201d Garcia said, noting that while new buildings will be constructed, the school\u2019s enrollment capacity will remain the same.\n\u201c[Biscayne Park] really is in a fortunate geographic location,\u201d he added. \u201cTraffic is going to be an issue for us for the indefinite future.\u201d\n",

The property includes two buildings and totals 230,691 square feet of office space. The sale price was not disclosed.\nNewmark\u2019s Chris Murphy, Robert Hill, Gary Carr and Austin Sheahan represented the seller, Denver-based Northwood Investors. It purchased the property in 2010, deed records show.\nThe Offices at Park Lane were constructed in the 1970s, but were recently upgraded with a new conference center, tenant lounge, gaming area and furnished outdoor spaces, Newmark said. It was valued at $29.1 million for property tax purposes, appraisal data shows. The property is currently 66 percent leased and serves as corporate headquarters for Boka Powell, Curtainwall Design Consulting and Condon Tobin, according to the release.\nThe office buildings are part of\nThe Shops at Park Lane\n, a 33.5-acre mixed-use district off U.S. Highway 75 about eight miles north of Downtown Dallas. The district features 540,000 square feet of retail space, including a Whole Foods, and more than 570 multifamily units.\nBorra made news this summer when his firm\npicked up 112 acres\nin Celina. He plans to develop a mixed-use project at the site. He also made a similar purchase to Offices at Park Lane in September, when he bought the 10-story, 242,00-square-foot Corporate Point office tower in Las Colinas. It was built in 1981.\nCommercial deal flow is on the rise across the nation, as institutional capital thaws. In the third quarter of this year, investment sales were up 19 percent, year-over-year, Newmark said.\nSimilarly, the\nDallas-Fort Worth office market\nis slowly rebounding. Total vacancy inched down from 25.3 percent to 25 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter, according to a report from Partners Real Estate. The rate slid slightly from 25.1 percent to 25 percent between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of this year. In addition, average office rents jumped 2.5 percent between the second and third quarters to $32.06 per square foot. Third quarter rents are up 4.8 percent, compared to the same period of last year, Partners said.\n",

The deal is expected to close early next year.\nThat\u2019s about half of the\n$566 million\nprice tag that seller Rockpoint Group paid for the Midtown East office tower in 2019, and adds to the list of deeply discounted office buildings that Werner\u2019s snapped up in recent years.\nThat includes the Hudson Yards-area office building at 440 Ninth Avenue he bought in August for\n$105 million\n(sellers Taconic Investment Partners and Nuveen Real Estate\n$269 million\nin 2018), the building at 205 East 42nd Street he and 601W Companies bought last month for about $300 per square foot and the tower at 675 Third Avenue he and Metro Loft Management bought in April for\n$100 million\n.\nA representative for Werner declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Rockpoint did not immediately respond to a request. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger negotiated the sale.\nBuilt in 1972, the property also known as One Dag stands at 885 Second Avenue near the United Nations Headquarters and has long been home to various consulates and permanent missions.\nThe 870,000-square-foot building is about 72 percent occupied, with Memorial Sloan Kettering, the United Nations and the Republic of Germany counting as its largest tenants.\n\u201cOne Dag is strategically positioned among several iconic Class A office assets boasting an average occupancy of 90 percent in the Midtown East market,\u201d reads a marketing memo from Newmark, which notes the building recently received more than $20 million in capital improvements.\nSimilar buildings in the area get average rents ranging from $80 to $90 per square foot, according to Newmark, which positions One Dag as \u201ca compelling relative discount in Midtown East.\u201d\nBoston-based Rockpoint Group financed its 2019 purchase of the building with a $430 million loan from Wells Fargo and Brookfield.\nThe purchase price then worked out to about $650 per square foot. Werner\u2019s deal pencils to roughly $310 per square foot.\nWerner, known for striking when property prices are low as well as for his quirky dealmaking style and penchant for flipping deals, has been converting some of his discounted office properties into residential apartments, and keeping others as commercial buildings.\nHis current buying spree started in about 2022, and he\u2019s since been\none of the busiest investors\nin Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "Scott Rechler is no stranger to enormous office-to-residential conversion projects in Manhattan. In the Financial District, however, the developer is trying something very different.\nRXR filed plans this week to convert part of 61 Broadway into housing, the New York Business Journal\nreported\n. The plans were submitted to the Department of Buildings on Monday.\nRather than transform the entirety of the 670,000-square-foot office property, RXR plans to redevelop only a single floor of the building. The ninth floor will spread 21 apartments across 20,000 square feet of residential space, along with a bike room and a lounge. CetraRuddy Architecture will design the space.\nThe developer did not return the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nRXR ran into trouble at 61 Broadway a couple of years ago. In December 2022, RXR\nwent into default\non the property when it stopped making payments on the loan, which it took out in 2019. The loan had a two-year initial term and three one-year extensions, reaching maturity default in May 2023.\nMonths later, JLL\nlisted for sale\na $240 million nonperforming loan on the troubled Financial District office building. RXR had agreed to hand the keys back through a deed in lieu of foreclosure if necessary, but never did so.\nAt that time, the office space was only 57 percent occupied. In 2019, flexible workspace provider\nKnotel leased\n60,000 square feet across four floors, but\nfiled for bankruptc\ny two years later.\nThe mini-project is a sharp contrast to another RXR conversion that could prove to be one of the biggest in New York City.\nRXR, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green and Marc Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management are planning to convert the 38-story office building at 5 Times Square\ninto up to 1,250 units of housing\n, mostly studios, of which 25 percent would be affordable.\nThe project is expected to get 467m, a property tax break earmarked for office-to-residential conversions where at least 25 percent of units are designated affordable; it would be eligible for a 90 percent exemption for 35 years if construction begins before June 2026.\nThis summer, Corebridge Institutional Investments\nprovided a $561 million loan\nfor the development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "A residential project with 446 homes in\nFlorida City\nwill be partly financed through a Community Development District.\nZamora Corporation proposed the Old Town Floridian CDD on the northeast corner of Southwest 336th Street and Southwest 192nd Avenue/Tower Road, according to Zamora\u2019s filings to Miami-Dade County and the project\u2019s website. The site, which is vacant and has an agricultural land-use designation, spans 77.1 acres.\nThe master-planned Old Town Floridian would consist of 178 villas, 160 townhomes and 108 single-family homes, according to the filings. Site plans show the homes would surround the pair of existing lakes on the site.\nCDDs are quasi-governmental agencies installed to help pay for the construction and maintenance of roads, water and sewer pipes, sidewalks and other infrastructure at massive developments. Overseen by boards, which at first consist of representatives of the developer, CDDs issue bonds that are repaid by special assessments, initially paid for by the developer and then passed on to homebuyers.\nFlorida City commissioners approved the Old Town Floridian CDD in 2020, and Miami-Dade commissioners greenlit it in 2021, according to the CDD\u2019s February board meeting filing.\nCapital improvements for the district are expected to cost roughly $12 million, including $6.8 million for roads, $2.6 million for sanitary collection, nearly $2 million for water connections and $937,000 for stormwater management, the meeting filing shows. The CDD plans to finance this partly by issuing an $8.6 million bond.\nZamora is led by Rosa Zamora, the filing shows.\nDevelopers have used CDDs in Florida since the early 2000s primarily for sprawling suburban housing projects along the state\u2019s west coast. Lennar and D.R. Horton are among the homebuilders that use CDDs.\nThe financing structure has gained more traction in South Florida in recent years, amid a development boom in the tri-county region with large projects. Miami Worldcenter\u2019s master developers, Art Falcone and Nitin Motwani, in partnership with Los Angeles-based CIM Group, created a CDD for the $6 billion project that spans 10 blocks in downtown Miami. In 2017, the CDD sold\n$74.1 million\nin tax exempt bonds.\nIn 2023, Sunrise commissioners approved a Community Development District for Metropica, a planned 64-acre master-planned project at 1800 Northwest 136th Street in Sunrise with 3,300 residential high-rise units. Through the CDD, developer Joseph Kavana can issue up to\n$65 million\nin bonds for infrastructure improvements and services for a 50-acre portion of the site.\nAlso in Sunrise, the city approved the creation of the\nSolterra Community Development District\n, which would finance infrastructure for developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr\u2019s planned\n900-home\nproject at 7400 Northwest 24th Place.\n",

The property was owned by finance industry veteran and racehorse breeder Jed Cohen and his son Tim; the elder Cohen died in 2022, and the son is now selling the property. The family bought the property from oil giant Texaco in 2000 for $3.9 million when the company was operating wells on the site.\nSince the nearly $4 million purchase a quarter century ago, the Cohen family has invested more than $30 million into the property.\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, we started and built this thing together,\u201d Tim said of purchasing the property with his father. \u201cIt just feels a little different now without him.\u201d\nA buyer would gain access to eight separate residences on the property ranging in size from about 900 square feet to 2,000 square feet. Tim Cohen lives with his family part-time in one white stucco home, and the other structures are used for staff. The property is zoned to allow the creation of another home of up to about 20,000 square feet.\nBesides being Cohen\u2019s residence and a popular\nfilming location\n, Rancho Temescal is a fully operational farm with various commercial portions. That includes about 600 acres of irrigated agricultural land, including lemon and avocado orchards as well as other crops. There are several equestrian facilities on site and an events venue used by the family in the past to host weddings and charity events.\nWhoever buys the property could also end up benefiting financially, as the Cohen family currently collects royalties from an oil drilling operation that still exists on the property. The oil and farm businesses are for sale with the ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Monroe Capital provided a $190 million loan for the purchase. Eastdil Secured advised the seller and arranged the debt.\nThe sale marks another large-scale hospitality trade in a market finding its footing after years of uneven recovery. Tourism has roared back and revenues are healthy, but rising labor costs, high interest rates and climbing property taxes continue to squeeze profits.\nLocated at 300 West 44th Street, the InterContinental opened in 2010 as one of the corridor\u2019s few luxury offerings. The project\nreportedly\ncost $500 million to develop. The property operates under IHG Hotels and Resorts management, but that structure will shift under the new ownership. The hotel is expected to convert to an IHG franchise, with Highgate taking over management, sources said.\nThe deal appears to be the second-largest single hotel deal of 2025, behind Kam Sang Company\u2019s purchase of the\nEdition Clocktower Hotel\nin October for $235 million. The same month, a group of large institutional investors\nbought a portfolio\nof four Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million.\n\u201cAfter a couple of years of New York being in the doldrums,\u00a0 it\u2019s kind of amazing the comeback that the city has endured thus far,\u201d said Daniel Lesser of LW Hospitality Advisors. \u201cThe hotel business is really strong in New York, from a top-line perspective.

The other 401 will be subject to HPD\u2019s Extremely Low &amp; Low-Income Affordability program, which calls for most units to be affordable to those earning, at most, 80 percent of the area median income. The apartments will be spread across two buildings, with one rising 15 floors and the other 25.\nUnit counts and affordability levels will be finalized when the project secures financing and the property is transferred to the development team.\nThe project will also include a marine science and STEM education center (operated by the Billion Oyster Project and BioBus) and an indoor-outdoor soccer field.\nThe plan is years in the making. The one-acre plot, which has sat vacant for the past seven years, was once home to a City Ice and Fuel warehouse and then served as a parking lot for Spectrum. The city originally only owned the waterfront portion of the site, but reached a deal with Spectrum\u2019s parent Charter Communications at the\nend of 2021\nto acquire the portion of the lot that has street access.\nThe\n2018 Inwood rezoning\nincluded plans to build more than 900 units of housing on city-owned sites, including the Ninth Street property, the Inwood Library and NYCHA\u2019s Dyckman Houses. A new library and 174 units of affordable housing opened in June 2024, but the city still needs to work with NYCHA residents before moving forward with a new building on the public housing site.\nThe Ninth Street project will include green technologies, including solar panels, water turbines, algae panels and a sand battery (which uses sand to\nstore heat\n), according to architect Fernando Villa, of Magnusson Architecture and Planning, which is designing the buildings.\nDavid Schwartz\u2019s Slate recently\nannounced\nthat it is teaming up with Evenhar Development to build a medical office and community facility property at 1578 Lexington Avenue for Mount Sinai. The company has also\nagreed\nto build 450 affordable housing units at a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, as part of Steve Cohen\u2019s casino plan for Citi Field. That proposal is\nawaiting\nfinal approval from the state Gaming Commission.\nThe Ninth Street project was part of the Adams administration\u2019s pledge to advance 24 affordable housing projects in 2024 on city-owned sites. HPD\nreleased\na request for proposals for the site in October of that year. The winning bid\u2019s unit count is slightly higher than the 570 apartments estimated when the RFP was released.\nHPD Acting Commissioner Ahmed Tigani said in a statement that the project underscores that his agency is \u201cfocused on building not just units, but affordable homes and communities.\u201d\n",

The deal for the property at 111 Clarkson Avenue breaks down to $504,000 per unit. The sellers were developers Seth Brown and Richard Ludwig.\nThe Lawrence is a fully rent-regulated property, providing \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d with his biggest challenge since delivering a championship to the Bucks five years ago. The building was developed in 2018 under the\n421a tax abatement program\n.\nAmenities at the two-building complex include a virtual doorman, a landscaped roof deck, a fitness center and two community lounges. No units are available, according to\nStreetEasy\n, and rents have ranged from $2,000 to $4,500.\nThe sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. Antetokounmpo\u2019s agent and investment firm did not return Bisnow\u2019s requests for comment.\nOutside of the world of commercial real estate, Antetokounmpo has been\nthe subject of persistent rumors\nthat he could be leaving the troubled Bucks franchise to become a New York Knick. Reports over the summer suggested he would be interested in a trade to the Knicks and the injured star was recently reported to be mulling his future over with the Bucks\u2019 brass.\nBut the purchase could be little more than a business move for Antetokounmpo. He launched Build Your Legacy Ventures, a venture capital fund, last year, according to the\nSports Business Journal\n. One of the fund\u2019s first investments was to back Unrivaled, a women\u2019s basketball league that puts on games during the WNBA\u2019s offseason.\nAntetokounmpo\u2019s portfolio also includes an apartment building in a suburb of Milwaukee, which he purchased last month for $11.4 million.\nHe isn\u2019t the only baller with multifamily real estate interests in Brooklyn. Remy Raisner, a former professional basketball player in France, has\namassed a portfolio\ntotaling 50 properties in Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Prospect Lefferts Gardens.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "As the opening of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ngleaming glass-and-steel skyscraper\ndrew near, some Midtown office landlords and brokers were quietly bracing for a shake-up.\nThe 2.5 million-square-foot Foster + Partners-designed tower at 270 Park Avenue is designed to accommodate roughly 10,000 of JPMorgan\u2019s 24,000 New York employees. Across the street is another building the bank owns, paving the way for what some have\ndescribed\nas a JPMorgan-centric neighborhood.\nWhen CEO Jamie Dimon cut the ribbon in October on the bank\u2019s new multibillion-dollar headquarters, it marked the start of a major migration from the company\u2019s other Midtown offices. The financial powerhouse has occupied several prime Manhattan buildings through long-term leases, leaving some to wonder whether they would vacate those properties once the new headquarters was complete.\nBut despite the grand opening, the Manhattan office market is not yet feeling any ripple effects. Rather than shrinking, JPMorgan is doubling down on some leases as it undertakes a $1 billion renovation of 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns building across the street from its new headquarters that it\nbought in 2008\n.\nThe bank just inked a 60,000-square-foot sublease at nearby 390 Madison, boosting its presence there to nearly 500,000 square feet. Elsewhere, it signed a multi-year renewal on its 270,000-square-foot lease at\n237 Park Avenue\n, a win for co-owners RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital. JPMorgan has also extended its 123,000-square-foot lease at Brookfield\u2019s 5 Manhattan West through 2031, retaining a Hudson Yards foothold.\n\u201cWe continue to maintain significant space at our locations across Midtown as we fully renovate 383 Madison over the next several years,\u201d a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said.\nOffice landlords may eventually feel the pain from the JPMorgan reshuffle. Renovations at 383 Madison are expected to finish in 2027, and the expiration of the 390 Madison sublease remains unclear. Landlord L&amp;L declined to comment on the deal, first reported by New York Business Journal.\nMeanwhile, landlords with expiring leases seem to be benefitting from the hot Class A office market. At Stahl Organization\u2019s\n277 Park Avenue\n, where JPMorgan occupies nearly half of the 1.9 million-square-foot building, it renewed 360,000 square feet in late 2024. Two other JP Morgan leases come due in the next few years. A 639,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2026 and a 175,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2028.\nThe landlord is in talks on both with \u201ctop echelon tenants at record-setting rents,\u201d a Stahl Organization spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe have signed leases, leases out, and deals pending for all of Chase\u2019s 2026 expirations. We have lots of inquiries and serious interest for their 2028 expirations,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nNearby, several buildings stand to be renovated to further cement the bank\u2019s \u201ccity within a city.\u201d The firm is weighing options for\n250 Park Avenue\n, an office building purchased last year for over $300 million, which could remain as-is, be redeveloped into a new office tower or converted into a hotel for employees. Plans for another office building at 410 Madison, acquired during the pandemic as a project office for the new headquarters, are also still undecided, according to Bloomberg.\nThe bank isn\u2019t holding on to all of its office properties. JPMorgan Asset Management is\nlooking to sell\na Plaza District office building for $270 million \u2014 roughly half of what it was asking for right before the pandemic hit five years ago.\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry rallied around frontrunner Eileen Higgins in the Miami mayoral runoff, and it paid off.\nThe ex-Miami-Dade County Commissioner defeated Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, by an 18-point margin on Tuesday.\nHiggins\nnabbed 59 percent of the vote compared to 41 percent for Gonzalez, who entered the runoff facing an uphill battle.\nIn the Nov. 4 city election, Higgins took first place in a crowded field of 13 candidates with 36 percent of the vote, while Gonzalez won nearly 20 percent. Because no candidate reached more than 50 percent of the vote, it triggered Tuesday\u2019s runoff.\nThe contest between Higgins and Gonzalez took on a heavily partisan tone, even though Miami local elections are non-partisan.\nGonzalez received endorsements from just about every prominent Floridian Republican politician, including President\nDonald Trump\n, whose primary residence is at his Palm Beach private club Mar-a-Lago.\nMeanwhile, the national and Florida Democratic parties invested heavily in advertising and mailers for Higgins, who also scored endorsements from famous Democrats like former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.\nHiggins\u2019 win makes her Miami\u2019s first female mayor and the first Democrat elected to the position in more than two decades.\nHiggins rakes in real estate donations\nOn the campaign trail,\nHiggins\nand Gonzalez both promised to fix the city\u2019s permitting process, which small business owners and major developers have complained is cumbersome and causes delays for construction timelines.\nBoth candidates also touted plans to tackle housing affordability. Gonzalez backed eliminating property taxes on homesteaded properties, while Higgins promoted her record at Miami-Dade County approving projects with nearly 7,000 affordable and workforce housing units.\nHowever, Higgins scored more support from bigwig real estate players than Gonzalez.\nHiggins racked up nearly 10 times more campaign donations from real estate professionals, corporations and land use attorneys than Gonzalez, according to finance reports for their campaigns after the Nov. 4 elections.\nHiggins also likely nabbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate donations to her political action committee, Ethical Leadership for Miami, which doesn\u2019t have to file its next financial report until January.\nLast month, Miami-based land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes co-hosted a fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami. Other heavy hitters on the invite included Jose Gonzalez, executive vice-president of Florida East Coast Industries, Brightline\u2019s parent company; Nelson Stabile, principal of Integra Investments; Jonathan Raiffe, CEO of Adler Properties; and Sara Adler, principal of Adler Properties.\nAttendees were asked to donate the maximum $1,000 allowed by state law to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign, or \u201cunlimited funds\u201d to Ethical Leadership for Miami. Under state law, no limit exists on how much money PACs can receive from a single donor.\nFinance reports for Higgins\u2019 individual campaign show she received the maximum $1,000 each from 14 developers, real estate corporations and land use attorneys, including Berkowitz Development Group\u2019s Jeff Berkowitz and his wife Yolanda, Swerdlow Group Chief Strategy Officer Michael Liu, Rilea Group and zoning lawyers Iris Escarra and Melissa Tapanes Llahues. In addition, three affiliates of Integra donated a combined $3,000 and six entities with the same address as Adler kicked in a combined $6,000.\nGonzalez received the $1,000 maximum from 11 real estate professionals and organizations, including Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, Associated Builders &amp; Contractors and land use attorney Anthony De Yurre.\nOther commission race runoffs\nThe city of Miami also held a runoff for an open city commission seat that ended with a victory for real estate broker and Brickell restaurant Sexy Fish manager Rolando Escalona. His win ended the Carollo political dynasty in Miami.\nWith 53 percent of the vote, Escalona defeated Frank Carollo, brother of Joe Carollo, who gave up the city commission seat for an unsuccessful run for mayor in this year\u2019s election. Joe Carollo was elected in 2017 when term limits forced Frank Carollo to relinquish the seat after he held it for eight years.\nAmong those who showed up at Escalona\u2019s victory party to congratulate him was Bill Fuller, a Little Havana developer who, along with his business partner Martin Pinilla, won a $63 million judgment against Joe Carollo in 2023.\nIn Miami Beach, former city commission aide\nMonica Matteo-Salinas\nwon an open city commission seat with 71 percent of the vote, defeating lawyer Monique Pardo Pope. The pair were vying for a position vacated by\nKristen Rosen Gonzalez\n, who was narrowly defeated in the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s race by incumbent\nSteven Meiner\n.\nPardo Pope attacked her opponent\u2019s tenure as chairperson of the Miami Beach Community Development Corporation, an affordable housing nonprofit which faced allegations of financial mismanagement and poor living conditions for low income residents in its multifamily buildings, according to the Miami Herald.\nPope faced criticism for\nfailing to reveal to voters\nthat her late father was a Nazi-sympathizing, serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people. After Miami-based filmmaker and local activist Billy Corben disclosed her father\u2019s notorious past and her social media posts idolizing him, Pope released a statement that \u201cI too am a victim in this.\u201d",

        "content": "Another Magnificent Mile office tower is on the brink of default, and set to drag its landlords, Abu Dhabi-based BlueFive Capital and Chicago-based\nGolub &amp; Co.\n, into further financial distress.\nTheir 28-story building at\n625 North Michigan Avenue\nhad its $50.6 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt transferred to special servicing last month due to cash flow issues, with loan servicers noting it\u2019s on track for \u201cimminent default\u201d after the property\u2019s performance plunged far below underwriting, according to Morningstar Credit.\nOccupancy at the 290,000-square-foot office portion of the property fell to just under 64 percent this summer, down from 92 percent when the loan originated in 2019. Its net cash flow is off 43 percent from initial projections, and the debt service coverage ratio \u2014 the amount of building revenue compared to the cost of its debt service \u2014 fell to just 0.41 in the first quarter of this year, far below the 1.35 trigger for lender control, loan servicer notes collated by Morningstar show.\nGolub and BlueFive \u2014 the latter of which gained control of the property after its September absorption of Dubai-based Neo Capital \u2014 now face the risk of foreclosure on the loan, according to Morningstar.\nThe ownership structure has shifted over time. Golub and\nLos Angeles-based CIM Group\npreviously co-owned the building before CIM sold it to Neo for $72 million in 2019. Golub still holds a stake in the property, marking at least its second Mag Mile distress saga this year following an episode at the tower at\n444 North Michigan\n.\nThat 36-story building was seized by\nBlackstone\nearlier this year via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. CIM was also a part-owner in that deal.\nAt the building at 625 North Michigan, the situation deteriorated after SS Research \u2014 formerly the largest tenant, occupying 6 percent of the gross leasable area \u2014 vacated in May. Despite the tower\u2019s average condition with no major maintenance flagged, its revenue has been too weak to keep up with loan obligations, lender commentary shows.\nThe building\u2019s lower four floors \u2014 which house the retail portion \u2014 are owned separately and have had their own issues. In 2024, investor Ben Ashkenazy surrendered that piece of the building to its lender to resolve a $61 million debt, as\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. The deed-in-lieu of foreclosure wiped Ashkenazy\u2019s equity and further fragmented the property\u2019s ownership structure.\nThe problems at the tower at 625 North Michigan add to a growing list of distress cases on the once-vaunted Mag Mile shopping corridor. Nearby, the office tower at 500 North Michigan recently sold for only\n$5.1 million to Greenwich,\u00a0Connecticut-based Commonwealth Development Partners\n, which plans a residential conversion. The fire sale price was a fraction of its pre-pandemic value, which once supported a $94 million loan against the property taken out by its previous ownership.\nJust to the south on the Mag Mile, Louisville, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions is in talks to buy the frazzled office building at\n401 North Michigan Avenue\n. It fell into trouble after its owner, Walton Street Capital, took on a $160 million debt from lender ING, and the property\u2019s value has since dropped, potentially below that figure.\nReal Capital is reportedly eyeing an offer of more than $130 million for the 748,000-square-foot building, but well less than the ING loan balance. The would-be buyer is a backup for Walton after the\nOlayan Group\n, a Saudi Arabian enterprise, expressed interest in the building at 401 North Michigan before backing out of a purchase.\nWhile BlueFive touted its September acquisition of Neo Capital as a strategic foothold in North American real estate, the distressed status of the tower at 625 North Michigan suggests a rough patch within its portfolio. The firm, which announced the integration of $650 million in Neo properties, did not respond to a request for comment. Golub declined to comment, and LNR Partners, the special servicer for the building at 625 North Michigan, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nPresident\nDonald Trump appeared to criticize\nthe state of the Mag Mile real estate market this fall with a cryptic post to social media, though local real estate professionals pushed back against his narrative of bleak prospects. Retail tenants have begun expressing more interest and making moves into storefronts on Michigan Avenue over the past two years, bringing vacancy down from post-pandemic peaks.\nBut the office market remains a challenge in Chicago and across the U.S., as remote and hybrid work, along with elevated interest rates compared to pre-pandemic keep flummoxing landlords who face upcoming loan maturities.\nWhether the tower at 625 North Michigan becomes the next to trade at a deep discount \u2014 or heads into foreclosure \u2014 now rests with special servicers and an ownership group struggling to stop the bleeding.\n",

The six-building Tech Corners office complex in Sunnyvale is reportedly a top choice for the car manufacturer, which welcomed Walmart\u2019s e-commerce division as a tenant earlier this year.\nCurrently, GM has Bay Area offices in cities like San Francisco,\nMountain View\nand Palo Alto. With an approximately 400,000-square-foot wishlist, GM could move several thousand existing workers into its future singular office. The automaker has purportedly struggled to find subtenants for portions of its San Francisco offices.\nGM will have to act fast, as the office market in Silicon Valley has gotten tighter as more AI companies set up shop and workers migrate to the region for jobs. Office vacancy has fallen for four consecutive quarters while demand for high-quality office space has picked up. At the same time, no new buildings are under construction.\nSunnyvale\nin particular has become a hotspot for tech operations as AI, software and hardware companies snap up office and research and development spaces in the city, such as\nDatabricks\u2019 305,000-square-foot lease\nin downtown Sunnyvale in July. In Silicon Valley at large, AI companies now occupy more than 6 million square feet, per\nCBRE\ndata\ncited\nby the Business Times. GM has seemingly been looking to beef up its AI and advanced software work beyond its AI research team in Mountain View, recently hiring AI leaders from giants like Alphabet,\nMeta\nand Amazon.\nGM could sign a lease for a new space in the next two months, the Business Times reported. Several of its office leases expire between 2026 and 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Affordable housing\ndevelopers no longer have to worry about\nMayor Karen Bass\n\u2019 temporary Executive Directive 1 expiring.\nOn Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to adopt the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance, permanently incorporating ED1\u2019s benefits into the L.A. Municipal Code, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Bass issued the directive in her first week in office in 2022, with the temporary order implemented immediately as part of an effort to speed up affordable housing construction projects.\nThe ordinance fast-tracks approval for projects comprising 100 percent affordable housing, requiring approval within 60 days, significantly shorter than the typical six to nine months for most multifamily projects.\nIn order to get the paperwork processed quickly, the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance removes many discretionary review processes that often slow down the approval process for developments, including City Council hearings, environmental reports and neighborhood outreach meetings. Developers must adhere to zoning laws and design review standards in order to qualify for streamlined approval.\nED1 brought in hundreds\nof applications to build affordable housing in the years since its implementation. As of last month, 490 projects have been streamlined under the directive, representing more than 40,000 affordable housing units, per Planning Department data cited by the Times. Of those 490 developments, 437 have been approved. Applications made their way through the approval process in 22 days on average.\nStill, the Affordable Housing Streamlining Ordinance could see some changes in the coming months. ED1 saw various carveouts to prevent overreach in many neighborhoods, including Bass\u2019 2023 exemption of single-family zones, which make up 72 percent of city land. Last year, she exempted historic districts such as parts of Highland Park and Lincoln Heights, as well as \u201cvery high fire hazard severity zones\u201d including portions of Silver Lake and the Hollywood Hills. Bass also sought to avoid displacing renters by sparing projects that would replace rent-controlled apartment buildings with 12 units or more.\nIn a Dec. 2 City Council meeting,\nCouncil member Ysabel Jurado\nsaid that the exemption to preserve rent-controlled buildings should be changed to five units from 12 to avoid displacing tenants in neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights. Jurado argued that the current ordinance exempts 19 percent of rent-controlled buildings, but if the minimum threshold were set at five units, it would exempt 36 percent.\nLos Angeles must plan to build 456,643 units of housing by 2029\nunder\nits state-mandated housing goals, with 184,721 units set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The developers paid $25 million for the units, or about $2.3 million per condo.\nOne remaining unit, owned by Edward and Karen Rado, is tied up in litigation. The Rados sued the condo association and the developers a year ago over the proposed buyout and termination of the association. The total expected purchase, including the Rados\u2019 unit, is $27.3 million, according to Vizzda.\nThe four-story building went up on a 1.5-acre property in 1984. The developers plan to knock the building down and construct an eight-story, 12-unit condo project.\nThe plan also drew a legal challenge from neighbors.\nEarlier this year, the adjacent Claridge Jupiter Island Condominium Association\nfiled a petition\nfor writ of certiorari against the developers and Palm Beach County over the proposed project. The suit, filed Aug. 22,\u00a0 alleges the county improperly approved a waiver requested for the project, and seeks to nullify\nthe decision\n.\nNeighbors who oppose Kolter and Perko\u2019s project refer to it as \u201cthe Beast of Beach Sound\u201d and claim it would \u201ccast shadows on the Claridge pool, spa, fountains, sunbathing areas,\u201d and lists the Claridge, Carlyle, Ocean Sound, Passages, Landfall and Sea Watch as opposed to the development.\nPerko\n, led by Phil Perko, and\nKolter\n, led by CEO Robert Julien, are working on another planned condo project.

But in the wake of the deadly Surfside condo collapse and condo safety legislation requiring significant investment in aging buildings, some condo associations have opted to hire brokers to market their buildings for sale to a developer or bulk buyer.\n",

        "content": "A mid-century modern-designed waterfront home at 303 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth changed hands on Wednesday for just under $6.4 million, marking the latest high-dollar sale \u2014 and another potential demolition \u2014 in the North Shore\u2019s robust luxury market.\nThe deal is notable not only for its price tag but for the buyers\u2019 intent: it is being eyed as a potential teardown, which would pave the way for a new, custom-designed mansion on the prime lakefront lot.\nWhile some local fans of the architecture may wish to preserve the\n1959-built home\n, designed by noted mid-century architectural firm Keck &amp; Keck, the buyer\u2019s agent, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, said concerns exist about its structural integrity.\n\u201cWhat makes this house still so valuable is its location is premier,\u201d Radnay said, noting that the nearby\nPlaza del Lago\nshopping center in Wilmette has been improved and added luxury retail tenants like\nHerm\u00e8s\nsince it was purchased by WS Development for $59 million in 2022.\n\u201cThis property has a beautiful street curb appeal. You can see right to the lake, from Sheridan to the shore,\u201d Radnay said, declining to identify the buyer. Public records of the sale aren\u2019t yet available in Cook County databases.\nCarol Hunt of Baird &amp; Warner represented the estate of Nydia Hohf, the home\u2019s former owner who died in September at 105 after living in Kenilworth for 67 years. Hohf and her late husband, Robert Hohf, commissioned the construction of the home. Nydia Hohf was also a daughter of the Wieboldt family, which ran an eponymous Chicago-area department store, Wieboldt\u2019s, for over a century until closing in 1987.\nHunt said the house received huge interest for its unique architecture. She worked with the Kenilworth Historical Society to organize an open house, which drew 200 people to tour the home in two hours.\n\u201cIn the mid-century modern community, people really wanted to see it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique property.\u201d\nHunt said people were interested in preserving the property, but she noted the condition is in bad shape and it wasn\u2019t clear how the house could be saved.\nRadnay\u2019s buyers came out on top after the offering drew multiple bids. The property was listed for $7 million in October.\nThe sale underscores the prevailing trend in the area, where buyers are prioritizing land value and location over existing structures. Another example is down the street, where a\n$6.8 million sale at 501 Sheridan Road\nis also a planned teardown, slated to be replaced by two new luxury homes by developers Leo and Milena Birov. The bigger property, which is on the lakefront, is a planned 17,000-square-foot mansion listed for $16.75 million. Next to it, on a lot facing Sheridan Road with no lakefront access, the Birovs are advertising a nearly $6 million, 11,000-square-foot mansion.\nThis year\u2019s\n$14.5 million record sale\nfor Kenilworth, at 219 Sheridan Road, further illustrates intense demand for North Shore lakefront property. To the north in Winnetka, Radnay also represented the buyers and sellers in last month\u2019s\n$33 million sale of a Sheridan Road mansion\nthat set the record for the priciest Illinois home resale in history.\nWith the luxury market continuing its high-dollar streak, developers and wealthy buyers are often willing to pay a premium to execute their vision for a new estate on irreplaceable land. The potential demolition of the 303 Sheridan home reflects the financial calculation that often prevails in the heated lakefront market. Adding the latest sale, six Kenilworth houses have brought in sale prices of more than $5 million this year, including two off the lakefront.\nA gutted and rehabbed historic home on\nKenilworth Avenue\nbrought in a likely record sale for a non-lakefront in Kenilworth when it sold for $6.1 million in October. The 129-year-old home retained its neoclassical facade, but the inside had been transformed in 2022 with an open floor plan and modern finishes.\n",

        "content": "A federal judge ruled that Cook County\u2019s system for handling unpaid property taxes violates the Constitution, delivering a major victory for homeowners who lost their properties and accumulated equity through tax sales.\nJudge Matthew Kennelly found that the process infringes on the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against unfair \u201ctakings\u201d and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on excessive fines, according to reports from the\nChicago Tribune\nand the\nChicago Sun Times\n. The ruling stems from the class action lawsuit Bell v. Pappas,\nfiled in 2022\n, which challenges how the county manages delinquent taxes.\n\u201cCook County arguably had every piece of information needed to know that its failure to compensate property owners created a high risk of constitutional violations,\u201d Kennelly said in his decision, noting the system was an \u201cobvious\u201d violation.\nUnder current law, property tax debt can be sold after 13 months of nonpayment. If the debt is not repaid within 30 months, tax buyers can claim ownership of the property and keep any profits beyond the debt owed. For example, a homeowner with $10,000 in tax debt on a $100,000 property could lose the entire home, forfeiting $90,000 in equity, while the tax buyer gains a windfall.\nThe lead plaintiff, Michael Bell, inherited a $115,000 home in 2017, but lost it after failing to pay $11,000 in taxes. Bell sought compensation for the lost equity rather than reclaiming the property. Other plaintiffs included another homeowner and community groups such as the Southwest Organizing Project and Palenque LSNA, which Kennelly ruled had standing. Since filing, the lawsuit has grown into a\nclass action\nwith roughly 2,500 homeowners, with estimated claims averaging $60,000 each.\nThe ruling does not determine how plaintiffs should be compensated or whether Cook County and Treasurer Maria Pappas are liable. Pappas and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle declined to comment due to ongoing litigation.\nIllinois remains the only state not to reform its tax sale system following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision\nin Tyler v. Hennepin County, which struck down a similar system in Minnesota.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorney John Bouman emphasized that legislative reform is inevitable, noting that the Illinois General Assembly must act to align state law with constitutional standards. Pappas\u2019 office has advocated for changes, including auction mechanisms to ensure homeowners receive surplus value, but it hasn\u2019t emerged as a\npriority for state lawmakers\n.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "The Alamo Heights City Council unanimously approved an incentive package valued at up to $2 million to support Ridgemont Properties\u2019 redevelopment of a long-vacant medical office building at 5307 Broadway.\nThe agreement, structured under Chapter 380 of the Texas Local Government Code, provides a 100 percent property tax rebate for 10 years and a 75 percent sales tax rebate for 15 years, the\nSan Antonio Business Journal\nreported. Projects in\nFort Worth\nand elsewhere in the state have negotiated similar deals.\nThe agreement requires San Antonio-based Ridgemont to invest at least $9 million in planning and construction, and stipulates that one restaurant must be operational by the end of 2027.\nThe site, formerly occupied by Nix Health until 2020, has remained empty for years. Rather than pursue another medical tenant, Ridgemont plans a mixed-use redevelopment.\nRidgemont Vice President Trebes Sasser Jr. outlined a strategy to activate the ground floor with food and beverage tenants, while converting the second floor into smaller office spaces. Another empty Nix site in Houston may convert to\napartments\n.\nThe company is targeting late 2026 for initial move-ins, with Studio8 Architects leading the design of the project.\nSasser emphasized that the Broadway corridor has suffered from limited commercial investment in recent years. He hopes the project will spur broader redevelopment, encouraging other property owners to pursue similar investments.\n\u201cThis project will serve as a catalyst for not just this asset, but also casts a vision for other property owners along the corridor,\u201d he told the Business Journal.\nRidgemont, run by CEO Trebes Sasser Sr., has other properties along\nHouston Street\nin San Antonio purchased last year. Ridgemont\u2019s website describes the company as a family investment firm focused on infill sites in San Antonio submarkets. It has holdings in multifamily, offices, retail, industrial and land.\nAlamo Heights, about five miles north of Downtown San Antonio, has become a\ntarget for teardowns\nas it gentrifies.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "A small\nMarin County\npost office is at the center of a back-and-forth over housing, but a new development proposal looks to keep the building in the same place.\nPaul Thompson, founder and president of Novato-based\nThompson Builders\n, bought the 34,720-square-foot lot at 15 Calle Del Mar in Stinson Beach for an undisclosed price and filed a preliminary application to build six residences at the site, the Marin Independent Journal\nreported\n.\nThe property is currently home to a 9,000-square-foot parking lot and a 3,392-square-foot commercial building, which houses the Stinson Beach post office, a catering company and a cleaning company. Thompson is looking to demolish the building and replace it with a mixed-use residential and commercial building on one corner of the property and four two-story detached condominiums in another. The post office would move to a new 1,250-square-foot space on the ground floor of the mixed-use building.\nThe four proposed condos would be sold at market-rate prices and range in size from about 1,700 square feet to 2,200 square feet with two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Another two residences would each span about 775 square feet on the second floor of the commercial building for a total of six units on site.\nMarin County might be known as a\nNIMBY stronghold\n, but officials are \u201chappy to see an increase to the housing supply\u201d at the site, Sarah Jones, director of the Marin County Community Development Agency, said.\nThompson\u2019s team is preparing to lean on California\u2019s density bonus law, not in order to build more units than zoning would allow, but to secure setback waivers tied to the surrounding wetlands and Eskoot Creek. Because the parcel sits in a coastal zone, the development would need a coastal permit and sign-off that it complies with Marin\u2019s local coastal program. That includes meeting creek and riparian setbacks that can exceed 100 feet. Septic will be another hurdle, as\nStinson Beach\nisn\u2019t under county authority for wastewater, and its water district requires a 100-foot buffer from waterways unless a variance is granted.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A lender is aiming to deliver a knockout blow against boxing promoter Don King over a distressed 52-acre redevelopment site in Palm Beach County.\nA foreclosure auction for the former jai alai fronton at 1415 45th Street in Mangonia Park is set for May 18 after Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Scott Kerner last month awarded a $42.5 million judgment in favor of an affiliate of\nTaylor Made Lending\n, a Pompano Beach-based hard money lender, court records show.\nKing\nand Taylor Made Lending\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nTwo entities managed by King that own the property listed the site for sale in April without an asking price, but sources said the boxing legend was seeking offers in the\n$100 million\nrange.\nThe same month, Taylor Made Lending sued the entities for allegedly defaulting on three loans totaling\n$38 million\nthat were obtained between 2023 and last year. Taylor Made is the special servicer, representing a consortium of investors that own the mortgages, including Miami-based Winston Capital Management.\nThe lawsuit alleges King is a personal guarantor of the loans, but he is not named as a defendant in the complaint. King has a pending motion to dismiss the foreclosure case.\nThe property includes a shuttered 282,800-square-foot jai alai fronton built in 1973, and a lot that is used for parking for a neighboring Tri-Rail passenger rail station, according to an online offering memorandum. King, who\norganized\nsome of boxing\u2019s greatest all-time matches, bought the site for $6.3 million in 1999, records show.\nKing took out the first loan for $22.3 million at a 13.9 percent annual interest rate in 2023, court records show. A year later, he took out the second loan for $9 million at an 18.5 percent annual interest rate, and the third loan for $800,000 with a 2 percent annual interest rate, according to the two mortgages, which were attached to the foreclosure complaint.\nTaylor Made alleges King stopped making the monthly $138,750 interest-only payments on the $9 million loan in September and failed to repay the $800,000 loan when it matured in December.\nKing last attempted to sell the Mangonia Park site a decade ago, but a deal with West Palm Beach-based FRI Investors fell apart.\nThe property is approved for primarily office, governmental, medical outpatient, educational and manufacturing uses, but 25 percent of the site could be developed into some retail such as pharmacies, gift shops, restaurants and gyms, the offering states.\u00a0In July, King sold another distressed property facing foreclosure. An affiliate of Straticon, a Boca Raton-based construction firm, paid\n$11 million\nfor King\u2019s warehouse in Deerfield Beach that served as the boxing promoter\u2019s headquarters. Proceeds from the sale satisfied an allegedly delinquent $5.1 million mortgage King took out on the property in 2023.",

Of that, $5 million would be pulled from special taxes paid by homeowners in the area. The columbarium proposal arose after veterans failed to get their wish for a service member cemetery in Irvine and took their plans to Anaheim for state backing.\nCity officials are looking to build a transit-oriented development that would link the Great Park and Irvine Spectrum neighborhoods at the Crescent site.\n\u201cThe area is particularly well-suited for higher-density residential and mixed-use formats, sidewalk-activated retail and creative commercial spaces, walkable urban blocks and a lifestyle environment attractive to young professionals and knowledge-sector employees,\u201d according to a city staff report cited by LAist.\nThe City of Irvine is required by the state to plan for 23,610 new residential units by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n.

Z&amp;L previously secured approval from the city of San Jose to\nbuild a 708-unit residential high-rise\n. Prior to the\nforeclosure seizure\n, Z&amp;L sought to stave off losing the property through various legal proceedings, including a bankruptcy filing.\nThe $23 million financing package is below what would typically be required to pay for construction of a major residential development such as the one plotted by Z&amp;L. Still, Xu, who signed the mortgage, is seemingly well-positioned to bring in more financing from other insurance companies, judging by the size of the financing deal, according to the Mercury News. Plans for the site are unclear.\nThe United Construction &amp; Development Group founder has developed several large projects in the New York City area, including\nSkyline Tower\n, the second-tallest skyscraper in Queens, as well as other residential towers in the city.\nThe site\u2019s new owners indicated in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing during proceedings with Z&amp;L that they were prepared to build a large residential project on the bus station site.\n\u201cThe vacant land at issue is a rotting, empty former Greyhound station,\u201d the owner group said. \u201cIf allowed to proceed [with a foreclosure], [we have] the resources to develop this piece of property as originally entitled.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It focuses on acquisitions between $3 million and $30 million in Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, El Paso, Houston and Austin. In addition to Gateway Business Center and Gateway South, PHP also bought a 30,000-square-foot industrial property in San Antonio, and the 50,000-square-foot Marine Creek Business Park at 3521 NW Loop 820 in\nNorthwest Fort Worth\n. All four purchases closed this year.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s\nindustrial market\nremains strong, even though its vacancy rate ticked up in the third quarter. The region logged its 60th consecutive quarter of positive industrial space absorption, according to a recent report from CBRE.\nLess than 3 percent of third-quarter completions were pre-leased, which caused the vacancy rate to rise 20 basis points in the third quarter to 9 percent, CBRE found. But that figure is expected to drop again in the near future, since the percentage of pre-leased\nbuildings in the pipeline\nincreased from 18.4 percent to 40 percent by the end of the third quarter.\nManufacturing drove most of the quarter\u2019s leasing demand, according to CBRE. The most in-demand industrial submarkets in the region are South Dallas and Northwest Fort Worth, which is home to AllianceTexas, Hillwood\u2019s 27,000-acre mixed-use development and logistics hub.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s luxury market closed out 2025 on a high note\u00a0 \u2014 and with a more diverse slate of trophy trades than usual.\nTony Upper East Side co-ops, a Gilded Age townhouse and condos in Downtown Manhattan and on the Upper West Side topped this year\u2019s list of the 10 priciest deals in the Big Apple, alongside the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertalls that have spent recent years\ndominating the rankings\n.\nVornado Realty Trust\u2019s 220 Central Park South reclaimed the No. 1 spot after two deals over $100 million unseated the skyscraper in 2024. The addresses of those sales \u2014 Vlad Doronin\u2019s 730 Fifth Avenue and Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower \u2014 still landed among the priciest trades, even though no deals there, or anywhere else, cracked the nine-figure mark in 2025.\nTogether, the city\u2019s leading deals totaled $540 million, down significantly from more than $720 million last year.\nDespite the lower total, New York\u2019s luxury market hardly felt sluggish, as both deals and prices\nrose in the first quarter\n. Despite fears over the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies began early in the year, the city\u2019s wealthiest buyers still kept the deals coming and were even undeterred by the November mayoral election, which some had warned could send rich New Yorkers in search of greener pastures.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the deals that powered the city\u2019s luxury market in 2025:\n220 Central Park South | $83 million\nMedia magnate Byron Allen sold his 45th-floor condo at 220 Central Park South for\n$82.5 million\n, securing its No. 1 slot on the list in just the third month of the year. Allen, founder of Allen Media Group, bought the 6,000-square-foot condo for $75 million just two years earlier.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern represented Allen in the off-market deal. A previous listing for the apartment described it as having five bedrooms, six bathrooms and two balconies.\n730 Fifth Avenue | $66 million\nThe second most expensive deal to close last year was the final condo at Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York. Unit 25A traded for\n$66 million\nin January to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an LLC.\nThe final apartment at OKO Group\u2019s hotel-condo conversion spans 5,800 square feet and has four bedrooms and a terrace.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin represented the buyer, while the developer\u2019s in-house team led sales, which launched in 2018.\n150 Charles Street | $60 million\nComing in at No. 3 is the new record holder for the priciest condo deal ever in Downtown Manhattan. Financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold their apartment at 150 Charles in March for a whopping\n$60 million\n\u2014 double what they paid for it in 2016.\nThe duplex, which sold to an anonymous buyer in an off-market deal, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\nCompass\u2019 Jim St. Andr\u00e9 and Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, whose new development dealmaking was featured on the new season of \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d represented the sellers. Compass\u2019 Eric Brown and Zeve Salman brought the buyer.\n960 Fifth Avenue | $54 million\nIn a list typically dominated by condos and townhouse sales, an apartment at one of Manhattan\u2019s esteemed co-ops managed to land in the top five priciest sales.\nThe 12th-floor unit at 960 Fifth Avenue sold in January for\n$53.5 million\n, a far cry from its 2023 listing price of $70 million. The co-op was sold by the estate of the late oil heiress Anne Hendricks Bass, who died in 2020, to a buyer whose identity is shielded by a trust.\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert had the listing.\n217 West 57th Street | $47 million\nUnit 121 at Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower sold last month for\n$47.5 million\n, down from its last asking price of just under $55 million. The buyer\u2019s identity was hidden by an LLC known as The Locker Room 121.\nThe full-floor condo, which spans 7,000 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, traded in an all-cash deal.\nAn in-house team with Extell Development is heading sales at the BIllionaires\u2019 Row tower alongside a team with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo. Compass\u2019 Maurice Mizrahi brought the buyer.\n111 West 57th Street | $47 million\nThis year marked a turnaround for 111 West 57th Street, which was struggling to find buyers before JDS Development and Property Markets Group swapped sales teams. With Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team at the helm, the developers offloaded penthouse No. 72 in April for just under $47 million.\nThe triplex condo traded for significantly less than the initial $66 million price listed in the developers\u2019 offering plan and came in under its\nlast ask of $56 million\n. But a deal is a deal, and the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower is now almost across the finish line with 95 percent of its units sold.\n50 West 66th Street | $47 million\nThe 47th-floor apartment at Extell Development\u2019s Lincoln Square project closed for $46.8 million in October, earning it the title of the most expensive sale on the Upper West Side this year. An anonymous buyer purchased the 6,900-square-foot condo, which features a terrace overlooking Central Park.\nThe developer\u2019s in-house team is heading sales at the 70-story tall project.\n973 Fifth Avenue | $46 million\nGoldman Sachs partner David Leuschen finally traded his Gilded Age mansion on the Upper East Side, though the final sale price was nowhere close to what he once sought for it in 2021.\nAn entity tied to the financier bought the 11-bedroom home at 973 Fifth Avenue in 2012 for $42 million. He listed the property almost a decade later for $80 million, though he didn\u2019t find a buyer until May, when he sold it for\n$46 million\nafter dropping the price under $50 million.\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang, Andres Perea-Garzon and Lesley Schulhof had the listing. Modlin brought the buyer.\n217 West 57th Street | $46 million\nCentral Park Tower continued to log discount after discount in 2025, but this deal still managed to land among the year\u2019s 10 most expensive trades. The supertall\u2019s 116th floor sold for just under\n$46 million\n, down $7 million from its last asking price and $20 million from the price specified in the developer\u2019s offering plan.\nThe condo spans 7,100 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Extell Development\u2019s in-house team and a team with Corcoran Sunshine head sales at the building.\n740 Park Avenue | $45 million\nAnother co-op topped the priciest deals list this year, this one a sprawling Park Avenue pad sold by the late wife of billionaire David Koch, Julia Koch. Billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin bought the 8,500-square-foot apartment in February for\n$45 million\n.\nKoch and her late husband bought the 18-room apartment in 2004 for $17 million. She started attempting to offload the unit, which was recently renovated, in 2022.\nCorcoran\u2019s Leighton Candler had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan rents are higher than ever as the year comes to a close.\nMedian rent in Manhattan reached $4,750 last month, according to the monthly report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel, which is based on new, brokered, market-rate leases. The boost spelled a 13 percent increase in prices year over year and the highest Manhattan rent ever recorded by the report.\nThe numbers bookend a banner year for Manhattan rents, which hit new all-time records five times in 2025. A combination of elevated mortgage rates, affluent new residents and tight supply has bolstered rents in the city\u2019s wealthiest borough, according to Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201cIt has all the makings of a tight market,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of deals to be had.\u201d\nManhattan median rents set their first record of the year in February, when they reached $4,500, and then kept climbing. Even though rents usually decline as both the temperature and demand cools, November came in $50 higher than the previous record, set in July ($4,700).\nThe higher end of the market has seen prices grow even faster than the borough-wide average. The median rent for the top 10 percent of apartments has grown more than 17 percent year over year, compared to the 13 percent city-wide growth rate.\nThat mirrors trends in the Manhattan sales market, Miller said, suggesting that instead of the same wealthy residents moving between renting and buying, the city is seeing an influx of affluent tenants. Meanwhile, Wall Street, responsible for more than 17 percent of the city\u2019s economy, continues to bring in record profits, according to a\nrecent report from the state comptroller\n. That puts money in the pockets of wealthier workers.\nBrooklyn and Northwest Queens have seen robust rent growth, but not to the same extent as Manhattan, consistent with the growing bifurcation of the market.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn came in at $3,804 while Northwest Queens fell just slightly to $3,510. Rent in Brooklyn has increased nearly 9 percent year over year, compared to just 1.5 percent in the Queens neighborhoods of Astoria, Long Island City, Woodside and Sunnyside.\nThe local trend runs in contrast to the national picture, where rents have been mostly flat or slipping.\nThe rent numbers are sourced from residential brokers and don\u2019t include unbrokered apartments, lease renewals, or rent-stabilized apartments.\n",

        "content": "With one week to go, the City Council is considering a number of bills feared by multifamily owners and developers.\nAs of this writing, a newly amended version of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is expected to drop Wednesday. Keep an eye out for our coverage on what that entails.\nA version of the measure\nreleased\nlast week gave nonprofits or private firms that team up with nonprofits first dibs on buying distressed multifamily properties with four or more units. Those changes did not win over the bill\u2019s critics.\nWednesday was the last day for bills to be finalized (the bills need to age before coming to a vote at the final City Council meeting of the year, Dec. 18).\nHousing groups have warned against four bills that would add new restrictions to city-funded housing, including setting a minimum for the percentage of two- to three- units built in these projects, capping the percentage of studio apartments in senior projects and requiring deeper affordability.\nI asked Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani about these bills during a press conference on Tuesday, but he didn\u2019t take a position. But the New York State Tenant Bloc, headed by Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, has come out against the bills.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that the incoming administration has the capacity to write a housing plan that can deliver on the affordability agenda that the Mayor-Elect ran on,\u201d said Ritti Singh, spokesperson for the Tenant Bloc. \u201cWhile these Council term-sheet bills are well-intentioned, they will limit Mamdani\u2019s ability to deliver on the agenda tenants across the city overwhelmingly voted for. In particular, they will slow down the development pipeline significantly and create new delays and new costs to produce the affordable housing New Yorkers desperately need.\u201d\nAnother measure would create a $40 per hour minimum wage and benefit rate for construction workers on projects that receive $1 million or more in city financing. The latest version of the bill excluded projects where 90 percent or more of the units are affordable to those earning at or below 60 percent of the area media income. The laborers\u2019 union, which has been pushing for the bill\u2019s passage, was not happy about the exclusions. I was told just before 5 p.m. that a new version will be released later Wednesday.\nLandlords have also been watching\na bill\nthat would require landlords to maintain a maximum indoor temperature in their buildings, either by providing central air or individual air conditioning units.\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted on where everything lands!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat issues would you like to see\nTRD\ncover in the new year? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA new report by HR&amp;A found that eliminating New York\u2019s Scaffold Law (which holds property owners liable when construction workers are injured in height-related falls) could result in savings that would support 8 to 10 percent more affordable housing units per project in NYC. The report was commissioned by the Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which has long been critical of the law. The report found that insurance costs in New York are two to five times higher than in other states.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Comptroller Brad Lander on Wednesday launched his campaign for New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District seat,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Lander is challenging incumbent Rep. Dan Goldman, with the support of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who was considering a run and secured the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America, also announced Wednesday that she will not throw her hat in the ring. She said she didn\u2019t want to split voters in challenging Goldman.\n\u2014 The New School is trying to close a $48 million budget gap by making steep staffing, faculty and program cuts,\nGothamist reports\n. The university has offered 40 percent, or 169, full-time faculty members voluntary separation or early retirement packages. Some view the cuts as an attack on the school\u2019s liberal arts divisions. \u201cIt does seem to be designed to minimize the power of the divisions that have historically been more politically motivated,\u201d Rachel Sherman, sociology professor at the New School\u2019s Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, told the publication.\n\u2014 ICYMI, Kathryn Garcia is taking over for Rick Cotton at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,\nPolitico New York reports\n. Garcia most recently served as Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s director of state operations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$22.7 million\nfor a 3,409-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at Extell\u2019s 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$273 million\nfor a 629,323-square-foot office building at 147 East 44th Street in Grand Central. Rockwood Capital sold the 43-story property to Sovereign Partners.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,920-square-foot multi-family at 120 East 10th Street in the East Village. Yoav Blat with Compass has the listing. The property last sold for\n$5 million\nin 2018.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 152,860-square-foot, eight-story school at 4261 Broadway in Hudson Heights. Matthew McChesney filed the permit on behalf of Lloyd Goldman of BLDG Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "As South Florida has become one of the most expensive places for dining out and for food and beverage tenants paying close to $100 a square foot for prime spaces, more local restaurants made an annual ranking of the 100 top grossing dining establishments in the country.\nFifteen South Florida restaurants are ranked in the 2025 Restaurant Business Top 100 Independents\nlist\n.\nMila, a pricey Mediterranean restaurant with a private members club in Miami Beach, claimed first place with $51.1 million in revenue this year, supplanting last year\u2019s No. 1 restaurant, Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, another South Florida dining institution. Mila occupies a 13,000-square-foot rooftop space at 1636 Meridian Avenue owned by David Edelstein\u2019s New York-based Tricap.\nThe restaurant, owned by\nGregory Galy\nand Marine Giron-Galy, ranked second last year with $49 million in revenue. Galy is a restaurant and hospitality developer.\nJoe\u2019s, which has been around for 110 years in the same spot in Miami Beach\u2019s\nSouth of Fifth\nneighborhood, dropped to third place in the latest Top 100 Independents list with $47.6 million in revenue. Last year, Joe\u2019s generated $49.4 million to claim the top spot. The restaurant is part of a two-story building owned by Stephen Sawitz, Joe\u2019s CEO.\nThe 13 other restaurants are ranked between 21 and 94 in the Top 100 Independents.\nFour more restaurants made the Top 100 Independents than last year, when 11 South Florida dining establishments were on the list. Still,\nSouth Florida\u2019s restaurant industry\nis going through some upheaval, Felix Bendersky with F+B Hospitality told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cIt was a tough year,\u201d Bendersky said. \u201cWe saw a lot of restaurants close. The biggest misconception [that restaurateurs] have is what it takes to hit those numbers, even for the best of the best. When a landlord says. \u2018I need a [tenant] that can do $30 million,\u2019 you can count the number of people who can do it with one hand.\u201d\nThe South Florida restaurants on the Top 100 Independents represent the top 1 percent of the tri-county region\u2019s dining scene, Bendersky added. \u201cMiami has become a place where there is no inbetween,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that made the list are all part of fantastic groups that are the best at what they do.\u201d\nOther restaurants that made this year\u2019s list include Komodo Miami at 26 with $23.1 million in revenue, Gekko Miami at 52 with $17.3 million in revenue and\nPapi Steak Miami\nat 64 with $15 million in revenue.\nDavid Grutman\u2019s\nMiami Beach-based Groot Hospitality owns the three venues. Although Komodo Miami tumbled from sixth place last year, and Papi Steak Miami fell from 27th place in 2024. Gekko Miami was not on last year\u2019s list.\nKomodo Miami occupies a ground-floor space in an office tower at\n801 Brickell Avenue\nowned by Miami-based Gatsby Enterprises. Papi Steak leases a space at 736 First Street in Miami Beach owned by Bernard Klepach, a North Miami business man who owns duty free shops at Miami International Airport. And Gekko Miami is in a ground-floor commercial unit of the SLS Lux Brickell condominium at Eight Southwest Eighth Street owned by a Delaware entity.\nDining out in Miami is more expensive than other U.S. metros such as Dallas, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, according to Chef\u2019s Pencil, which analyzed the cost of a mid-range three-course meal in a city and compared it to the average monthly net wage there.\nA mid-range three-course meal in Miami costs an average of $60. At Mila and Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, an average meal can cost $188 and $120, respectively, according to the Top 100 Independents list.",

        "content": "Dozens of Chicago homeowners attended a meeting hosted by Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s office in West Garfield Park to learn why their property tax assessments skyrocketed.\nAmong them: Tonya Reed of Maywood, who saw her property tax bill more than double this year, rising from about $5,100 to $11,000. The county mailed almost 1.4 million tax bills on Nov. 14, with payment due Dec. 15, the\nChicago Sun Times reported\n.\nFor Reed, the tax increase pushed her monthly mortgage payment from $1,600 to $2,400, leaving her family struggling to balance household expenses. The hikes are concentrated in predominantly Black neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides, according to a Cook County treasurer\u2019s office report cited at the meeting.\nThe\nreport\nattributes the burden shift to reductions granted by the Board of Review to large commercial properties, including retail and data centers. As property values in the Loop have declined since the pandemic, residential values in lower-income neighborhoods have rebounded to pre\u2013Great Recession levels, accelerating tax increases. Other critics have pointed to the assessor\u2019s\nzero-sum tax system\n.\nOverall, Cook County\u2019s tax levy has risen, while businesses in the central district contribute less. The Board of Review recently reopened appeals for 24 townships, with a Friday deadline. Many attendees at the meeting came to seek exemptions and file appeals with the Board of Review.\nWest Garfield Park experienced the steepest increases, with median homeowner bills up nearly $2,000, or 133 percent. Longtime resident Dorothy Rosenthal questioned the accuracy of such assessments, noting her property suffered severe flooding in 2023 and remains partially unusable. Despite neighborhood improvements, she argued values could not have risen so dramatically.\nAt the meeting, residents voiced frustration that sympathy from officials does not offset the financial impact, according to the Sun Times. Kaegi has presented himself as an assessor tough on\ncommercial landlords\n, claiming that the decline in Downtown Chicago\noffice values\nwas exaggerated.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Newport Beach, California-based Irvine Company has owned the property since 2010.\nThe Benesch deal follows a lease Irvine inked with Mayer Brown, an international law firm and the building\u2019s anchor tenant, which secured 272,000 square feet in an extension about a year ago.\nPrior to Benesch\u2019s expansion, the property was already 94 percent leased, according to data from CoStar Group, reflecting strong occupancy levels in a market where many office landlords face challenges. In the post-pandemic market, some law firms have been shrinking their space, while others are growing. For example, ArentFox Schiff recently vacated more than half of its space at\nWillis Tower\nwith a long-term lease extension. But earlier this year, Rope &amp; Gray expanded by 33 percent at a\nWacker Drive skyscraper\n.\nIrvine has positioned the tower at 71 South Wacker as a workplace designed with modern amenities and thoughtful layouts that foster collaboration, a good fit for\nlegal tenants\n.\nCleveland-based Benesch, which planted its flag in Chicago in 2015, is growing its space \u201cto keep pace with our sustained growth in attorney and staff headcount,\u201d managing partner Gregg Eisenberg said in a statement to Crain\u2019s.

It had an attorney headcount of 145 in Chicago as of June, or 20 more than a year prior, according to Crain\u2019s data.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Ari Klein, Scott Shelbourne and Jeff Skender represented Benesch in the lease negotiations.

        "content": "When you think Gary Barnett, you think Billionaires\u2019 Row penthouses, not run-down rental buildings.\nBut Barnett\u2019s Fifth Avenue air rights deal offers a solution for rent-stabilized properties\nin crisis\n.\nBarnett\u2019s Extell Development is acquiring 135,000 square feet of air rights from the Metropolitan Club on Fifth Avenue for his mixed-use\nproject\nat 655 Madison Avenue \u2014 a deal made possible by the City of Yes.\nThe club\u2019s 790 Fifth Avenue is a landmark. Before City of Yes, it could sell air rights to a very limited number of properties next to it, but because the market was microscopic, a deal never happened. The club is only using 42 percent of its theoretical square footage, according to PropertyScout.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, passed in 2023, allowed landmarks to\ntransfer air rights\nto sites farther away. Barnett\u2019s development site is a full avenue from the Metropolitan Club, but now it can acquire the club\u2019s rights.\nIf Extell uses the 135,000 extra square feet to build more apartments, it would mean homes for hundreds more people and millions of dollars of additional tax revenue. I think we can all agree those are good things.\nAnother plus: The Metropolitan Club will get money from the sale. Landmarks are expensive to maintain, and the sale proceeds will be used to fund continuing maintenance under a plan filed with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nGiven the extra costs that the commission imposes on buildings when it makes them landmarks, expanding their ability to sell air rights was the least the city could do.\nWhy not help rent-stabilized buildings in the same way?\nThey, too, have been burdened by the government: The state\nstrangled\ntheir revenues by\npassing the HSTPA\nin 2019. It also made the law permanent, removing landlords\u2019 leverage to negotiate changes. Demolition of these buildings is extremely difficult because tenants have a right to perpetual lease renewals.\nEven if an owner can buy out enough tenants to reach 80 or 100 percent vacancy, the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal sometimes\nrefuses\npermission to substantially rehabilitate the building and remove it from rent regulation. HCR has become\nincreasingly stingy\nabout this.\nFor many owners, there is\nno escape\nfrom this\nfinancial vise\n. All they can do is buy time by deferring maintenance.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is looking for ways to help landlords keep up their rent-stabilized buildings\nwithout raising rents\n. Giving them the ability to sell air rights to a broad range of buyers is one way to do that \u2014 and would also allow developers to build more housing, which is also\ndesperately needed\n.\nNIMBY groups such as Village Preservation and people in Queens who voted for Andrew Cuomo would voice hysterical opposition to the prospect of more apartments, but Mamdani doesn\u2019t owe them anything.\nTenant groups, meanwhile, would likely support a measure that raises money from developers and ensures it can only be spent to upgrade rental buildings. YIMBY groups would welcome the creation of housing.\nDevelopers hate Mamdani\u2019s plan to raise taxes, but they willingly pay for air rights. And unlike a tax hike, the city could liberalize air rights transfers without a new state law.\nThe housing shortage is crushing New Yorkers, and rent-stabilized buildings are falling apart. Mamdani and Julie Menin, the next City Council speaker, could get their tenures off to a strong start by creating revenue literally out of thin air for two of the city\u2019s most pressing needs.\n",

Torrance-based\nOverton Moore Properties\nwas the seller, offloading the property five years after purchasing the property for $115 million and building a distribution center at the site.\nThe industrial property opened this year as a custom-built facility for Amazon. The Jeff Bezos-led e-commerce giant occupies the entirety of the building, and the expiration date of its lease is not clear.\nThe deal is Morgan Stanley\u2019s latest vote of confidence in Southern California\u2019s supply-constrained logistics market. Last month, the firm\u2019s real estate subsidiary bought a 26-acre industrial outdoor storage parcel at\n10650 Hemlock Avenue\nin Fontana for $92 million. Old Castle Infrastructure, a subsidiary of building material company CRH, sold the property.\nMeanwhile, Overton Moore, one of the West Coast\u2019s most active logistics developers, has been growing in California. Last year, the company raised $150 million to buy industrial buildings to add to its collection.

        "content": "Majestic Developers, a four-year-old firm, is preparing to build a new headquarters in Sugar Land as part of its plan to double its workforce over the next year.\nThe company, already based in Sugar Land, recently acquired a 2.5-acre site at 7627 Branford Place near Costco and several medical office buildings off Interstate 69, in a $2.6 million deal, the\nHouston Business Journal reported\n. The seller, Branford Med Properties, had previously intended to develop the land for doctors before the plan fell through.\nMajestic intends to break ground in early 2026 on a four-story office building spanning 45,000 square feet to 48,000 square feet. Construction is expected to take 12 to 18 months, with Majestic managing the $10 million-plus project entirely in-house, including design and construction.\nThe building will feature a distinctive design inspired by nearby offices and highlighted by a giant \u201cM.\u201d Planned amenities include a gym, full kitchen and bar for events.\nMajestic\u2019s current headquarters spans less than 10,000 square feet at 1650 Highway 6, about two miles away, with its lease expiring at the end of next year. The company currently employs 50 to 60 people, but aims to surpass 100 employees by the end of 2026, primarily expanding its engineering team. The growth stems from plans to break ground on eight projects next year, in addition to contracting to handle projects for other firms.\nFounded in 2021 by CEO Santosh Cividi, Majestic focuses on single-family development and smaller residential projects in the Houston metro market. It recently launched its first major project, Majestic at Harvest Green, a 12-acre commercial center within Johnson Development\u2019s\nHarvest Green\n\u201cagrihood,\u201d offering retail, restaurant, office and event space. While the company initially considered building its headquarters at Harvest Green, it decided to quickly secure the Sugar Land site once it became available.\nThe new site sits across I-69 from the Smart Financial Centre and near a planned 50-acre\nmixed-use development\nby Dhanani Private Equity Group, as well as Sugar Land\u2019s new Trader Joe\u2019s, which opened in October 2024.\nSugar Land, which\ncompetes with Houston\nfor office tenants, has landed some marquee corporate names, including\nFrazer\n, Sysco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nRe/Max represented Majestic in the purchase of the property. Partners Real Estate represented the seller.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "The shrinking supply of unsold new development units caught up to the market in November.\nThere were 187 contracts signed at new development projects last month, down 22 percent from the same time last year, according to Marketproof\u2019s monthly\nreport\n. That drop mirrors the market segment\u2019s\nfall performance\n, which is down roughly 21 percent year-over-year since the start of September.\nContract activity for new development pales in comparison to the city\u2019s performance as a whole, which has\nsurged in the last few months\ndespite concerns over how the November election of\nZohran Mamdani might deter wealthy buyers\n. In November, overall contracts in Manhattan rose by over 20 percent from last year, according to\ndata\nfrom Miller Samuel.\nThe culprit? A\ncontracting pool of available new units\n. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to blame muted purchase volume on the Mamdani election, but there\u2019s no evidence for that,\u201d Marketproof Kael Goodman said in a statement. \u201cThe simpler explanation is, inventory is low and new launches are scarce, so fewer buyers are finding what they want.\u201d\nIn the second quarter of this year, Manhattan\u2019s supply of new development condos reached a 10-year low at fewer than 3,600 unsold units, according to data previously shared with\nThe Real Deal\nby Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\nProject launches in Manhattan have been under the 10-year average for the last three years, but 2025 is shaping up to be the year when dwindling supply rears its head as buyers burn through the backlog of projects that built up around Covid.\nIn November, Manhattan saw 88 signed contracts, down from 125 last year. Nearly double the new units hit the market this fall compared to one year ago, but that rush followed few buildings coming to market during the spring \u2014 only 225 units, down from 511 last year, according to Marketproof.\nThe top-selling building in the borough has been Izaki Group\u2019s Village West project at 525 Sixth Avenue, which scored 16 contracts in November and has already put more than half of its 68 units in contract since launching sales in September.\nThe borough has seen a number of notable launches in the fall, including MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residences at 126 East 57th Street, Related Companies\u2019 144-unit Upper East Side project called the Strathmore and the Flatiron Building\u2019s hotly-anticipated conversion into 38 ultra-luxury units. But none of them has yet contributed meaningfully to the contract tally.\nThe metrics also continue to suffer from 80 Clarkson, the largest launch of the year, not reporting any contracts despite\nevidence of off-market sales\n.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d Goodman\ntold The Real Deal last week\n.\nIn Brooklyn, there were 79 new development contracts signed in November, down from 110 last year.\nFall sales launches this year in Brooklyn have accounted for 172 new units entering the market, down 50 percent from last year, according to Marketproof.\nIn 2024, the borough launched a number of large developments, including One Domino Square and Williamsburg Wharf in North Brooklyn, which combined for a collective 249 units. The Bergen in Boerum Hill also launched its 105 units in 2024. Those buildings have often alternated among the top-performing developments in the borough through much of their early sales cycles.\nBy comparison, the top-selling development in November was an eight-unit converted brownstone at 503 Clinton Ave, which signed six contracts last month.\nQueens also slowed in November, with 20 contracts signed compared to 30 last year. The borough had no new development launches through October, when Flushing\u2019s Northern Center Condominium released 11 of its 135 sponsor units. In November, two boutique projects launched 13 combined units.\nLast fall, Queens saw 361 new development units enter the market.\n",

In Downtown Brooklyn, his firm could be on the outs with a troubled office property.\nClipper Equity is facing foreclosure on 250 Livingston Street, with the mortgage backing the building will be sent to special servicing next week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nClipper became delinquent on the $125 million mortgage last month. The firm is considering handing the keys to the property back to the lenders, though Bistricer believes he can resolve the issue with the lenders and duck foreclosure proceedings, tapping IronHound Management to assist Clipper through negotiations.\nStill, in a filing, Clipper said it \u201cdoes not plan to continue to support the ongoing operating and debt service shortfall related to\u201d the building, and would look to sell.\nIn March, the lenders notified lawyers for Bistricer that he was in default because Clipper did not deposit all of the requisite rental revenue into a designated account. They threatened to foreclose if Clipper didn\u2019t pay off the mortgage in full, according to filings, but have yet to do so.\nThe building was\ndealt a catastrophic blow\na few months ago when the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration exited 350,000 square feet, decamping for 2440 Fulton Street. Bistricer claims the firm is in negotiations with a tenant for a portion of that space, though he did not identify the tenant or how much they would take.\nThis isn\u2019t the first financial issue Bristricer has braced for in the Brooklyn office market.\nLast year, a Morningstar Credit report identified a delinquent loan behind 141 Livingston Street. Clipper ultimately\ndefaulted\non the $100 million mortgage backing the property after Kings County Civil Court passed on a renewal at the building, leading its lenders to file for foreclosure.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The\nnorthern section\nof the megaproject is called Foundry Park, with an estimated cost of more than $1 billion.\nThe apartment towers would exceed 450 feet, and in total Foundry Park would feature up to 3,737 housing units. Although less dense than Sterling Bay\u2019s original 14 million\u2011square\u2011foot version of the project, the plan still features large\u2011scale buildings that would significantly reshape the area.\nChicago-based Sterling Bay was the original developer that\nbacked out after the project stalled\n. The joint venture of Chicago-based JDL and Los Angeles-based Kayne Anderson bought most of\nthe site\nfrom\nBank OZK\n, which seized\u00a0 it from Sterling. The land was previously tied to the former Finkl steel mill and General Iron operations.\nJDL, led by CEO Jim Letchinger, is the developer on the project, with Kanye Anderson, led by CEO Albert Rabil as the equity partner.\nThe zoning application outlines a program combining single\u2011family homes, townhomes, condos and rental units, along with 350,000 square feet of office space, 420,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, plus 250,000 square feet of hospitality. The developers intend to build 3,207 units initially \u2014 305 for-sale homes and 2,902 rentals \u2014 including 641 affordable units for households earning an average of 60 percent of area median income.\nThe plan incorporates 12 acres of open space, six parks and a walk spanning most of the site\u2019s 3,000 feet of river frontage. Southport Avenue would serve as the project\u2019s primary corridor, lined with mid\u2011rise and high\u2011rise residential buildings and a hotel.\nThe first phase would rise on a triangular parcel bounded by Southport Avenue, West Cortland Street and North Kingsbury Street.\nA key complication is Sterling Bay\u2019s continued ownership of a northern parcel within the existing planned development. Sterling Bay consented to the rezoning only on the condition that it retains rights to build 400 units on its property.\nCity planning officials have emphasized the need for new infrastructure to manage traffic and improve site access. Negotiations continue over revisions to the existing redevelopment agreement, originally crafted for Lincoln Yards, which envisioned up to $490 million in infrastructure reimbursable with tax increment financing. Foundry Park\u2019s lower density may reduce the need for large infrastructure, though improvements to Dominick Street, Southport and a potential Southport\u2011Throop bridge remain under discussion.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s beleaguered Oceanwide Center site is closer to coming under new ownership, five years after development stopped and left a gaping hole in the ground in South of Market.\nThe San Francisco Recovery Fund put down a nonrefundable deposit on the Oceanwide site at 50 First Street in a deal expected to value the parcel at about $100 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing sources close to the deal. The deal is expected to close within the next two months. The exact deposit amount has not been disclosed.\nThe Recovery Fund, led by SKS Partners veteran Dan Kingsley and private equity alum Jay Yang, first entered a\ncontract to buy\nthe development site in September. With the deposit handed down, the Fund is nearing official ownership of the site.\nOceanwide Center\u2019s history dates back a decade when Chinese developer Oceanwide Holdings acquired the site in 2015 for nearly $300 million. At the time, the developer plotted to build a 2-million-square-foot mixed-use project with one 605-foot tower with hotel and residences and another 910-foot tower with offices and residential units. Groundbreaking was held the following year.\nIn 2019, Oceanwide Holdings started looking for new capital funding for the project. The firm sought development partners or buyers who would completely take over the project. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based company paused work on its mixed-use\nOceanwide Plaza project in Los Angeles\n, which sits abandoned and\ncovered in graffiti\ntoday.\nOceanwide Holdings stopped construction on Oceanwide Center\u2019s shorter building in 2019 and similarly paused work on the taller tower in the fall of 2020. The project came to a halt as the complex\u2019s ground-floor concrete structure was completed.\nOceanwide subsequently entered various possible deals with development and capital partners, but none of them ever came to fruition.\nCreditors seized the project site\nin 2021 after missed payments on $321.5 million of debt, and stakeholders are still involved in litigation over unpaid bills. Those companies still have about $21 million in liens on the Oceanwide site, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "John Novak is rapidly ascending the ranks of Chicago developers by striking a deal to buy the troubled southern portion of Lincoln Yards from JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling Bay, following the sellers\u2019 failure to bring a massive commercial real estate plan to fruition.\nAn affiliate of Novak\u2019s contracting firm,\nNovak Construction\n, is moving forward with the acquisition of 18.4 acres of vacant riverfront land where Chicago-based Sterling Bay had proposed a huge mixed-use campus. It\u2019s just west of the empty life sciences building Sterling built at 1229 West Concord Place, John Novak and his firm\u2019s executive vice president of development, Jake Paschen, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile they declined to comment on the price of the acquisition, they confirmed it\u2019s well below the roughly $200 million Sterling and JP Morgan spent to assemble the parcels during the 2010s, as well as to prepare the parcels for development and carry them since then, according to people familiar with the project.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is at the bottom of the bottom, but I think there is more room for upside here than downside,\u201d Novak said. \u201cWe just need to figure out what will be the best value and use of the land.\u201d\nNovak expects to close before the end of 2025.\nThe deal brings a new face to a site that has become synonymous with development struggles in Chicago. Real estate insiders frame the acquisition as a distress sale, reflecting the difficulty the current owners have had in moving forward with the large redevelopment plan. The land, part of the larger, ambitious $6 billion mixed-use Lincoln Yards development, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and is changing hands as the original vision dissipated over the last two years.\nThe planned purchase marks the second time this year that a deal for the southern portion of the site has been put together, underscoring the urgency with which JP Morgan and Sterling Bay are now offloading the property. The first attempt to sell the site earlier this year to developers\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n, at a price Chicago real estate sources pegged at about $60 million, ultimately fell apart.\nThat deal disintegrated after\nJP Morgan balked\non completing the transaction, leaving the future of the parcel uncertain until the recent emergence of Novak. Kayne and JDL this year formed a development team to buy the northern 30-plus acres of Lincoln Yards from\nBank OZK, which stripped that assemblage\nfrom Sterling Bay and its other partner, Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. JDL and Kayne have since sought Chicago City Council approval to build\nmore than 3,700 residential units\non that stretch, which sits on the other side of the Chicago River from Novak\u2019s planned purchase.\n\u201cThe Lincoln Yards south property remains a huge opportunity, and we are interested in seeing it succeed,\u201d a spokesperson for Sterling Bay said.\nA spokesperson for JP Morgan declined to comment.\nFor Novak, the acquisition is a calculated risk and a major expansion of his development portfolio. The site along the Chicago River is considered a prime, albeit challenging, development opportunity. He has yet to decide what kind of buildings he will ultimately pursue for the site.\nThe overall Lincoln Yards project has been plagued by a number of issues, including initial political opposition to the massive public subsidies granted for the development, market volatility and a slowdown in commercial real estate demand that has hit large-scale office and retail projects particularly hard. The development was initially pitched as a comprehensive neighborhood with residential, commercial and entertainment components, transforming a former industrial area into a vibrant new section of Chicago.\nThe latest deal, led by an affiliate of Novak\u2019s firm, signals a renewed attempt to capitalize on the riverfront location and unlock the value of the land.\nNovak\u2019s firm was founded in 1980 as a general contractor, which remains its main business. But in the last five years it has accelerated its development efforts, Paschen and Novak said. Its development projects include the Whole Foods on West Belmont and Ashland avenues in Lakeview, as well as a 206-unit multifamily project with a 50,000-square-foot Target store in the Portage Park neighborhood, among other properties.\nNovak said the Lincoln Yards deal will mark the biggest amount of land his firm has purchased for development, but it isn\u2019t the largest in terms of the dollar amount of his other projects. He has also developed a $70 million medical office facility for the\nRush University\nhealth care system at 1630 North Harlem Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Pro-development organization YIMBY Law is taking\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nto court for his executive order banning Senate Bill 9\u2019s application in Los Angeles neighborhoods burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nYIMBY Law\u2019s lawsuit\n, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that Newsom unlawfully restricted homeowners\u2019 ability to rebuild by giving local governments the green light to shelve SB 9, the 2021 state law that permits duplex construction and lot-splitting on parcels zoned for single-family homes, Politico\nreported\n.\nResidents in the Pacific Palisades appealed to Newsom over the summer to stop SB 9\u2019s implementation, fearing that allowing duplexes and split lots would diminish the neighborhood\u2019s character and make evacuation efforts in future fires worse.\nMayor Karen Bass\nand City Council member Traci Park similarly\nexpressed their opposition\nto SB 9\u2019s use in the Palisades.\nNewsom issued his order in July in response to the lobbying, from people including reality TV star and Palisades resident\nSpencer Pratt\n.\n\u201cMy parents survived the Eaton fire, but our home didn\u2019t,\u201d Altadena resident Andrew Post said in a news release from YIMBY Law. \u201cNow, as we want to rebuild and come back to the community we love, we\u2019re staring down costs we can\u2019t meet. SB 9 isn\u2019t a danger, it\u2019s a lifeline. It gives people like us a real chance to rebuild by creating rental income or making space for multiple generations and families to live on the same land. Taking that option away means pushing out the very people who are trying hardest to come back.\u201d\nAfter the governor handed down his order, the city governments of Los Angeles, Malibu and Pasadena, as well as Los Angeles County, put the kibosh on SB 9 rebuilds in areas prone to fires. YIMBY Law\u2019s suit includes each local jurisdiction as a defendant. The nonprofit claims SB 9 provides cash-strapped property owners the opportunity to earn rental income or sell a portion of their lot to pay for their rebuilding efforts.\nThe San Francisco-based group was in talks with Newsom\u2019s team last week about standing down on its lawsuit if the governor agreed to allow duplex construction after a year, YIMBY Law executive director Sonja Trauss told Politico. The Newsom camp didn\u2019t act, prompting the organization to pursue legal action.\nMost homeowners were under-insured, and now rents are spiking, land values are falling, and rebuilding costs are astronomical,\u201d Trauss said in a statement. \u201cMaking it harder for families to use the single most impactful tool they have left \u2014 their land \u2014 doesn\u2019t make recovery safer. It raises the barrier of who gets to come back at all.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s team swiftly rebuked the lawsuit.\n\u201cWe will not allow outside groups \u2014 even longstanding allies \u2014 to attack the Palisades, and communities in the highest fire risk areas throughout L.A. County, or undermine local flexibility to rebuild after the horror of these fires,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cOur obligation is to survivors, full stop. We will not negotiate that away. If defending them requires drawing firm lines, we will draw them.\u201d\nPark, who represents the Palisades, also shared her disappointment with YIMBY Law\u2019s complaint.\n\u201cAfter what this community just lived through, the idea of forcing more density into a high-fire-severity zone demonstrates this isn\u2019t about sound housing policy, but ideological extremism,\u201d Park told Politico.\nWhether the banning of SB 9 in these neighborhoods was legal remains a question to be answered by the court as part of YIMBY Law\u2019s case.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
