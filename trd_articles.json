        "content": "Billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart sold a home in Palm Beach two months after upsizing to a $30 million landmarked home on the island.\nJohnson-Marquart and her husband, musician and music producer Mike Marquart, sold the house at 449 Australian Avenue to Victor and Julia Tolkan for $16.7 million, the Palm Beach Daily News\nreported\n.\nShelly Newman with the Corcoran Group had the listing, and Dana Landry with Dana Edward Landry brought the buyer.\nJohnson-Marquart is the daughter of the late Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr., the fourth-generation Johnson scion who spearheaded the creation of SC Johnson\u2019s Glade air fresheners, Off! Insect repellent and Pledge furniture polish. Those products helped to grow the company to a billion-dollar cleaning products giant.\nIn October, Johnson-Marquart and her husband bought a 7,500-square-foot landmarked home known as Villa Banyan for\n$30 million\n.\nThey bought the Australian Avenue home for $15.9 million last year, according to property records. Built in 2017 on 0.2 acres, it spans 3,600 square feet, four bedrooms, five bathrooms and one half-bathroom.\nThey listed it for $17 million in September, according to Zillow.\nJohnson-Marquart\u2019s recent Palm Beach deal marks the latest sale on the island as its busy season for real estate deals revs up. Earlier this month,\ncoffee magnate Bob Stiller\nfound a buyer for his lakefront estate asking $84 million. Also this month,\nprivate equity billionaire Greg Mondre\u2019s\nteardown asking $39.5 million went pending. Mondre bought a larger oceanfront lot earlier this year for\n$58 million\n.\nNearby, in North Palm Beach\u2019s gated Lost Tree Village community, fintech billionaire Ronald Clarke bought a 2.5-acre waterfront compound for\n$97.5 million\n. The seller of the estate was William Wrigley Jr., the billionaire heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "An elite lakefront corridor north of Chicago had most of the top luxury residential sales in Chicagoland this year, with some\nNorth Shore homes\nreaching values never before seen in Illinois.\nSix of the seven most expensive single-family home sales this year took place on a three-mile stretch of Sheridan Road between Winnetka and Kenilworth. Two of those homes, both in Winnetka, sold for more than $30 million, marking the most expensive homes sold in Chicagoland history.\nAnd one agent, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, was on one or both sides of all six of those North Shore deals. The preeminent dealmaker for the North Shore\u2019s coveted lakefront properties, Radnay was the sixth-highest selling agent in Cook County in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s 2025 rankings\n, with $213 million in sales across 41 transactions.\nThe concentration of top-tier sales in the North Shore is a change from\nrecent years\n, when neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast and Streeterville dominated the list. The deals are also getting bigger. In 2024, three deals cleared $10 million, and in 2023 it was four. This year, the top six deals in Cook County all closed for more than $10 million.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market took off in 2025, as strong stock market returns drove wealthy buyers toward real estate, and scarce inventory sharpened competition for trophy properties. In Cook County, 105 sales were over $4 million between October 2024 and October 2025, according to research by\nThe Real Deal.\nThe run of luxury success is likely to continue into 2026. Billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s last Chicago property \u2014 the top-floor penthouse at the Park Tower \u2014 is under contract with a\n$12.5 million list price\n. And a spec mansion on the lake in Kenilworth is looking to beat the record in that village,\nasking nearly $17 million\n.\nHere are the most expensive home sales in Cook County of 2025, based on\nTRD\u2019s\nresearch.\n609 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $32.5 million\nJust months after a neighboring mansion set the all-time record for a Chicagoland home sale, this 16,000-square-foot mansion snatched the crown with a\n$32.5 million off-market deal\nin November. Jeff Quicksilver, a co-founder of Walton Street Capital, and his wife Ashley Quicksilver, who owns a local fashion boutique, sold the French provincial-inspired estate.\nThey built the home in 2017 after tearing down the previous home on the 1.6-acre site. The design was led by architecture firm Northworks, with interior design by Kara Mann. The Quicksilvers bought that previous home for $8 million in 2013.\nRadnay represented both the Quicksilvers and the buyer, who has not yet been identified. The deal also included about $2 million in personal property included in the house.\n419 Sheridan Road, Winnetka\n| $31.3 million\nThis 13,894-square-foot lakefront estate held the title of Chicago\u2019s priciest home resale for a few months, after selling for $31.3 million in August. Retired Goldman Sachs partner Muneer Satter and his wife, Kristen Hertel, sold the property. The estate features 223 feet of private beach, a boathouse and an infinity pool.\nThe\nseven-bedroom mansion\n, built in 1928 and designed by architect Ernset Mayo, underwent significant renovations under Satter and Hertel\u2019s ownership. The couple first purchased the property in 2002 and bought an adjacent parcel in 2013. They spent\ntens of millions on renovations\nand additions on the estate.\nRadnay represented both sides of the deal. The buyer was not identified in public records.\n219 Sheridan Road, Kenilworth | $14.5 million\nThis 1907 Colonial Revival mansion traded for\n$14.5 million in October\n, becoming the most expensive home ever sold in Kenilworth. Built by Paul Starrett \u2014 the man who designed the Empire State Building \u2014 the 8,280-square-foot home was sold by designer Yoanna Kulas.\nKulas, who bought the home built in 1906 in 2020 for $4.5 million, renovated and modernized the interior while preserving its historic features. The renovations were led by architect Michael Abraham and luxury designer Mick De Giulio.\nRadnay represented both Kulas and the unidentified buyers in the deal, which closed at nearly 97 percent of its asking price.\n973 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $12 million\nThis seven-bedroom coastal-style mansion kicked off the summer\u2019s high-end frenzy when it sold for $12 million in June. The\n9,650-square-foot home\nis decked out with amenities including a basketball court and golf simulator. It sits on a bluff with 100 feet of private beach.\nThe sellers were a trust associated with Luke and Margaret Kelly. They built the home in 2020 on the 1.75-acre site that they purchased for $6.19 million in 2017. John Baylor and Cricket King of @properties represented the seller, while Radnay brought the buyer. The home was bought under a land trust that obscured the new owner\u2019s identity.\n765 Sheridan Rd, Winnetka | $11.4 million\nThis\n15,800-square-foot lakefront\nhome sold for $11.4 million in July. The seller, Morris Silverman, bought the land for nearly $6 million in 2003 and finished the massive home in 2005. Silverman initially asked $18 million for the home in 2024, but cut the asking price to just under $12 million in February.\nThe interiors feature heavy detailing, including a Chagall-inspired mosaic ceiling and beveled mahogany floors. Outside, the property has a pool, an outdoor kitchen and 100 feet of private beach.\nRadnay represented the seller, while Annie Flanagan of @properties represented the buyer, who isn\u2019t identified in public records.\n4 E Elm Street, PH23, Chicago | $10.1 million\nThe only Chicago property to sell for more than $10 million in 2025, this\nfull-floor penthouse in the Gold Coast\nsold for $10.1 million in March. Former Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari and his wife, Kate Carbonari, sold the 5,400-square-foot unit, which they bought as raw space in 2016.\nThe unit features panoramic views and a 12-foot-high glass wall that opens to a balcony. Sharon O\u2019Hara and Carrie McCormick of @properties represented the sellers, while @properties\u2019 Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers.\nOther condos downtown have failed to crack $10 million this year, as the neighborhood has struggled to regain property values that dipped over the last few years. The closest was a penthouse at the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive that sold for $9.25 million in October to Siri cofounder Dag Kittlaus.\n381 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $9.6 million\nThree doors down from the second-priciest home of the year,\nthe mansion at 381 Sheridan Road\nbrought in $9.6 million when it sold in June. The home\u2019s seller was Tom Day, CEO of Reyes Beer Division, who bought it for $7 million in 2022 from Neil Fitzpatrick, co-founder of quantitative trading firm Headlands Technologies.\nThe 8,100-square-foot Neo-Georgian home includes a theater, gym and sports simulator. Radnay represented the sellers, while Grace Flatt of @properties represented the buyers, who are not identified in public records.\n",

        "content": "The billionaire sheen of\n220 Central Park South\nis getting scuffed by a decidedly unglamorous neighbor dispute this holiday season.\nGainsborough Studios, the landmarked 1908 co-op next door at 222 Central Park South, is suing Vornado Realty Trust over damage allegedly caused by years of heavy-duty construction at the ultra-luxury supertall, the New York Post\nreported\n. The co-op is seeking at least $3 million to cover repairs it claims Vornado agreed to pay for but refuses to reimburse.\nThe allegations paint a vivid picture of what happens when a 70-story tower rises beside a 16-story historic building.\nExcavation for 220 Central Park South began in 2014 with blasting through bedrock to create three underground levels about 50 feet below grade, according to the complaint filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. By the end of that year, Gainsborough\u2019s building had shifted downward and eastward, twisting nearly an inch at the top, per the complaint.\nThat movement, the suit claims, triggered a cascade of problems: cracked foundations, broken windows, chipped skylights, air conditioning issues and damage to the historic facade.\nWhile the repairs have since been completed, Gainsborough says it paid the costs itself despite agreements signed in 2008 and 2014 that required Vornado to cover construction-related damage.\nResidents and board members didn\u2019t mince words.\nOne longtime resident told the Post the building was \u201cbasically\u2026molested by the whole thing,\u201d while board president Tod Williams, whose architecture firm occupies the ground floor, said the blasting \u201cfelt like a seismic shift\u201d and forced workers to wear noise-canceling headphones for more than a year.\nVornado disputes responsibility. In court filings, its attorney said any damage was caused by \u201cintervening acts of third parties,\u201d not the developer\u2019s work. Vornado declined to comment to the publication.\nThe stakes are modest by Billionaires\u2019 Row standards. Gainsborough\u2019s $3 million claim is a rounding error compared to the roughly $3.5 billion in sales at 220 Central Park South, which cost about\n$1.5 billion to build\n. The tower is home to nine of the 20 most expensive residential sales in New York City history, including Ken Griffin\u2019s record-setting $238 million purchase and an\n$82.5 million deal this year\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The partners filed an application with Miami-Dade County\u2019s Shoreline Development Review Committee, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMiami Beach-based Prosper is led by Jay Roberts.

Units will range from 1,000 to 2,700 square feet, spanning one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans.

Earlier this month, developer Vivian Dimond\nlanded $67 million in construction financing\nfor Tula Residences, a waterfront condo project that had previously stalled out under developer Pacific &amp; Orient Properties.\nAlso in North Bay Village, Related Group and Macklowe Properties are planning\na Ritz-Carlton-branded complex\nwith two 43-story buildings with 364 condos.

In July, he landed\n$39 million\nin construction financing for a 13-unit Coral Gables townhome development. In April, he\nscored a $105 million construction loan\nfor a planned 10-story, 347-unit apartment building in Hialeah.\nEarlier this year, Prosper\u2019s Roberts partnered with Versluys Group on\na planned $650 million luxury condo tower\nin Brickell.

        "content": "A\nBrentwood\nmansion billing itself as a private sanctuary on about an acre lot turned the heads of a prospective buyer to land the No. 1 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts.\nThe 11,000-square-foot residence at 1504 North Kenter Avenue hopped into the top spot on the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, with a $25.9 million asking price that pencils out to $2,260 per square foot.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County homes in the Multiple Listing Service asking $4 million or more.\nAcross the county, 14 properties went into contract last week, adding up to $142.2 million in asking volume, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Compared to the year-ago period, that\u2019s four fewer contracts. Still, the total asking volume last week was up over 20 percent from a year earlier.\nThe priciest deal featured a 2024 new build that was designed by architect Richard Landry\u2019s Los Angeles-based Landry Design Group. The residence features a spiral staircase, floor-to-ceiling glass walls, elevator and primary suite with its own terrace.\nRecords show a limited liability company managed by attorney David Shladovsky bought the property in 2020 for $2.9 million, or $253 per square foot.\nWhen the completed six-bed, 10-bath residence first hit the market last June, it sought $30 million. It went off and on the MLS after that, seeing price cuts along the way. The most recent price change to $25.9 million was in September.\nAaron Kirman and Cindy Ambuehl of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California hold the listing.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest home to go into contract, based on the listing price, was in Beverly Hills at 1335 Carla Lane.\nThe\nTrousdale Estates\ncontemporary home spans about 11,000 square feet and is asking just under $20 million, or $1,817 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s been on and off the market since 2023, when it was first listed for nearly $22 million.\nThe home last traded in 2020 for $16.8 million, according to listing sites.\nA Delaware LLC called Stella Properties is the seller, with the shell company managed by a registered agent in Century City, according to state records.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni and Branden Williams hold the listing.\nHighlights include a glass bridge at the entrance, two-story courtyard, Japanese garden, wellness center and home theater.\n",

        "content": "A veteran San Francisco developer wants to put new condo supply back on the table near Oracle Park after years of false starts downtown.\nDavid O\u2019Keeffe, working with San Francisco\u2013based Stanton Architecture, has floated plans for a 33-story condominium tower in South Beach, a block away from Oracle Park, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The proposal calls for 260 units at 329 Bryant Street, a half-acre site currently occupied by low-rise commercial buildings.\nPlans submitted to the city show a slender tower rising above two historic structures that would remain in place, alongside three levels of parking, said Stanton Architecture\u2019s Stephen Allen.\nO\u2019Keeffe, a longtime player in the neighborhood, picked up the four parcels that make up the site from Fortress Real Estate Advisors for $7.3 million in October 2024. His past projects nearby include the Hotel Via across from Oracle Park and a 44-unit condo building on King Street, both developed before the city\u2019s residential pipeline largely froze during the pandemic-era downturn.\nTo unlock extra height and density, the project would include 40 affordable units under California\u2019s density bonus law, a now-standard trade-off for developers trying to pencil new housing in San Francisco.\nStanton Architecture said the condos are aimed at the mid-to-upper market rather than the ultra-luxury tier that once dominated new towers near the waterfront. Unit sizes would range from sub-500-square-foot one-bedrooms to three-bedroom homes topping 1,100 square feet, offering a broader mix than many pre-pandemic condo projects.\nNew ground-up residential development in San Francisco has been scarce as developers grappled with falling rents, weak buyer demand and stubbornly high construction costs. In recent months, however, some architects and landowners have\nbegun dusting off plans\n, betting that improving market sentiment could support new starts. Still, more than 20,000 homes have been approved citywide but little has been built, with developers sidelined by high interest rates and construction costs as capital instead chases existing apartment deals, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nover the weekend.\nThat makes the timing\u00a0 fluid. A final application is expected next year, with the construction schedule hinging on city approvals and whether San Francisco\u2019s fragile residential recovery continues to firm up. For now, the proposal could stand as another signal that local developers are cautiously reentering the ring.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

BridgeCity Capital provided the financing for the 14-story development.\nThe financing comes at an 80 percent loan-to-cost ratio.

The site is zoned for shorter buildings than what Southside is proposing. Schwartz is also asking planning officials to waive a parking requirement for the lot.\nHe received approval from the City Planning Commission in June, according to BLDUP.\nSchwartz acquired the property in 2022 for $3.7 million.

        "content": "Faced with fire damage, frozen permits and a City Hall she says can\u2019t scale, a Pacific Palisades developer has made a radical pitch a year after the destruction: break away from Los Angeles.\nSanta Monica-based developer and reality TV alum Elaine Culotti is pushing for the Pacific Palisades to secede from the City of Los Angeles after losing roughly 20 percent of her real estate portfolio in the January fire, the Santa Monica Daily Press\nreported\n. Culotti argues the city\u2019s disaster response exposed deeper structural failures that threaten property values, rebuilding timelines and insurability across fire-prone hillside neighborhoods.\nIn the days after the blaze, Culotti said state and local officials touted debris-clearing capacity that appeared robust until she realized the figures applied to all of California, not Los Angeles County or the Palisades specifically. As residents struggled through conflicting guidance and opaque timelines, Culotti said it became clear the city lacked the logistical capacity to handle a disaster of that scale.\nCulotti\u2019s, who starred on Discovery\u2019s \u201cUndercover Billionaire,\u201d makes the call after she devised an alternative debris-removal strategy dubbed \u201cDebris on Rail.\u201d It would have moved fire waste from the Palisades, Malibu and Altadena via rail lines to a processing facility in Puente Hills. The plan, she said, was vetted with FEMA, the governor\u2019s\u00a0 emergency services office and the Army Corps of Engineers and even pitched to federal appropriations staff in Washington. California ultimately declined to adopt it.\nCulotti took the rejection as an indicator that the size of Los Angeles\u2019 government has made it unwieldy to respond effectively to crises. She says the breakdown has direct consequences for real estate, from stalled permits and frozen valuations to mounting carrying costs for owners unable to rebuild, rent or sell damaged properties.\n\u201cHow do you value real estate if you can\u2019t sell it, rent it, repair it, or build on it? How do you keep paying mortgages, security, maintenance, brush clearing, insurance with no path forward?\u201d she told the Daily Press. \u201cNo industry can survive like that. And no homeowner should be asked to.\u201d\nHer answer is municipal divorce. Culotti is advocating for the Palisades to become its own city, with local control over infrastructure, emergency response and rebuilding. She is also working to establish a community center to serve as a civic hub, though she claims even that effort has run into resistance from city agencies.\nNo major neighborhood has successfully seceded from an existing large city like Los Angeles in modern times. But nearby examples like West Hollywood, which\nincorporated\nin 1984, and Malibu, which\nfollowed\nin 1991, show how affluent, civically engaged communities have used cityhood to seize control of zoning, development and environmental rules. Those took years to organize, but ultimately reshaped local real estate outcomes for decades.\nThe secession push comes as wildfire risk, insurance pullbacks and rebuilding delays increasingly shape land values across Los Angeles\u2019 hillside markets. That pressure has only intensified as the Los Angeles City Council has moved to\nforcibly clear the last uncleared Palisades fire lots\nnearly a year after the blaze as prolonged cleanup timelines stall rebuilding and prolong uncertainty for owners and lenders alike.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Trader Joe\u2019s just made a pricey Santa Monica land play, snapping up a former Rite Aid along Wilshire Boulevard as it continues to expand in Southern California and scoop up drugstore boxes left behind by bankrupt chains.\nThe Monrovia, California\u2013based grocer paid $22 million for the 17,800-square-foot property at 1331 Wilshire Boulevard, or about $1,236 per square foot, according to public records cited by the\nLos Angeles Times\n. The site, which sits on roughly 1.4 acres with about 125 surface parking spaces, was sold by a private owner.\nThe deal is another example of the growing reuse of Rite Aid locations, which began to flood the Southern California market after the pharmacy chain filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in two years in May.\nThat month, Rite Aid put more than 1,200 owned and leased stores\nup for sale nationwide\n, including 59 in Los Angeles County alone, with A&amp;G Real Estate Partners marketing the portfolio. At the time, brokers described the sales process as fast-moving, with grocers and value retailers among the most aggressive bidders.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has been one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers leaning into that churn. The company recently surpassed 600 stores nationwide and has steadily added locations in California, where competition for well-located grocery sites remains fierce despite broader retail softness. In December, Trader Joe\u2019s opened a new store in the Orange County municipality of Costa Mesa, and earlier this year it disclosed plans to\nopen nine additional locations\nacross SoCal, from the San Fernando Valley to San Diego County.\nRecent market trends explain the disconnect.\nSanta Monica retail rents have eased but remain high in prime corridors, with average asking rents slipping from about $5.50 to $4.47 per square foot per month while deals on Montana Avenue, Main Street and Wilshire Boulevard continue to close north of $5 and as high as nearly $10 per foot, according to a CoStar-sourced\nreport\nfrom Illi CRE. At the same time, vacant available retail space has more than doubled to roughly 635,000 square feet since it began rising in mid-2023, punctuating softer overall fundamentals while reinforcing that well-located, grocery-anchored sites still draw aggressive pricing.\nSecond-generation drugstores with parking, visibility and neighborhood-serving zoning that can be quickly converted into smaller-format grocery stores have fit that pattern. Those boxes have become especially valuable as ground-up retail development\nremains constrained\nby high construction costs and entitlement hurdles.\nFor landlords and lenders sitting on empty or soon-to-be-vacant Rite Aid sites, Trader Joe\u2019s move is another sign that the best-located assets will clear, even at premium pricing. For everyone else, the scramble to backfill thousands of former pharmacies is still just getting started.\n\u2014\nJudah Duke\n",

        "content": "Fresh off setting a Chicago-area residential price record, Jeffrey and Ashley Quicksilver quietly reappeared \u2014 snapping up a historic lakefront mansion in Kenilworth for $14.5 million.\nThe Quicksilvers sold their 16,000-square-foot, five-bedroom Georgian-style estate in Winnetka at\n609 Sheridan Road\nfor $32.5 million in November, Cook County records show. The couple were the buyers of the Kenilworth deal that closed in late October, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nJeffrey Quicksilver is a co-founder of Walton Street Capital, one of Chicago\u2019s most prominent real estate investment firms. His wife, Ashley Quicksilver, owns Athene, a high-end women\u2019s boutique in\nWinnetka\n. Together, they used a land trust to purchase the Kenilworth property at\n219 Sheridan Road\n, masking their identities until now \u2014 a tactic also employed by the still unknown buyers of their record-setting Winnetka estate.\nThe Kenilworth home sits on roughly a half-acre with 115 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and comes with a lineup of outdoor amenities, including a boathouse, fire pit area, glass-enclosed patio and multiple terraces. Records show the Quicksilvers have already explored zoning relief to add a swimming pool on the bluff\u2019s land and have expressed interest in adding a bathroom to the existing boathouse.\nBuilt in 1914, the three-story mansion was developed by\nPaul Starrett\n, the legendary builder behind the Empire State Building and the Lincoln Memorial. The six-bedroom home has been fully restored, blending preserved architectural details \u2014 original moldings, oak floors and custom wrought-iron railings \u2014 with modern upgrades, including new mechanical systems, windows, a smart home platform and zoned climate control.\nHighlights of the interior work include a primary suite with a custom wardrobe room featuring leather accents, along with a lower level outfitted with a wine cellar, theater, catering kitchen and wellness center complete with sauna, steam room and massage space. The $14.5 million price tag also included roughly $500,000 worth of furniture and personal property, according to records.\nJena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represented the Quicksilvers in both deals and confirmed to Elite Street their role as the Kenilworth buyers.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about a down-trade,\u201d Radnay told the outlet. \u201cIt was an up-trade. The Kenilworth mansion was a smaller scale but the same level of exquisite finishes.\u201d\nThe seller of the Kenilworth home was Yoanna Kulas, founder of design firm Caladrius Studio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Align Real Estate cleared a major hurdle in its bid to remake one of San Francisco\u2019s most controversial grocery sites into housing.\nThe developer behind the Marina District Safeway redevelopment has secured labor agreements with San Francisco\u2019s powerful building trades, a move that brings its 25-story, 790-unit\nproposal\none step closer to approval under a state streamlining law, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe deal positions Align to formally file the project under AB 2011, a California statute designed to fast-track housing on commercial sites in exchange for strict labor and environmental standards.\nThe project would replace the decades-old Safeway at 15 Marina Boulevard with a new grocery store topped by nearly 800 apartments, including about 86 affordable units.\nThe scale has\nfueled fierce opposition\nfrom Mayor Daniel Lurie, Supervisor Stephen Sherrill and neighborhood activists. Critics argue the tower far exceeds local zoning and clashes with the mayor\u2019s newly adopted \u201cFamily Zoning\u201d plan, which seeks to guide growth in historically low-density neighborhoods like the Marina.\nAlign counters that state housing laws trump local rules. By locking in union backing from the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council and the NorCal Carpenters Union, the developer can invoke AB 2011\u2019s accelerated approval timeline, potentially forcing the city to sign off within months rather than years. The law was written explicitly to sidestep protracted local fights that have stalled housing production across San Francisco.\nThe Marina proposal is just one pilot piece of a broader bet.\nAlign and Safeway have floated\nsimilar mixed-use redevelopments\nat four major grocery sites citywide, totaling roughly 3,500 apartments, with additional locations under consideration. The push has made Safeway-owned land a new front line in San Francisco\u2019s housing wars.\nStill, uncertainty looms. Align has not disclosed financing details or a construction timeline, and city officials have signaled they plan to scrutinize the project closely, despite the state law\u2019s limits on local discretion.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "One of the Austin area\u2019s\nfastest-growing suburbs\nis trying a lighter touch approach to economic development: speed.\nThe Hutto City Council voted Dec. 18 to fast-track what it calls \u201ceconomically impactful development,\u201d adopting a policy that promises a 10-business-day review period for permits tied to industrial and commercial projects. The resolution takes effect Jan. 1 and applies across all permit types tied to those projects, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nResidential developers won\u2019t see a change. Single-family and multifamily projects will continue to follow Texas\u2019 standard 30-business-day review timeline. Instead the city\u2019s focus will remain on job creation and commercial tax base growth rather than more rooftops.\nThe move arose from a November meeting of the\nHutto Economic Development Corporation\n, whose board unanimously approved a letter urging the City Council to adopt the policy. In that letter, the EDC argued that shaving weeks off permitting timelines would make Hutto more competitive in attracting employers and private capital, accelerate the delivery of job-producing projects and signal a more responsive posture to developers and business operators.\nThe city appears to be positioning speed as a substitute for subsidies. Unlike many of its peers in the Austin metro, Hutto has generally avoided large incentive packages and tax abatements, opting instead for smaller, targeted efforts \u2014 such as backing a local bookstore and coffee shop with a $32,000 sales tax abatement to help with retrofitting a historic home for the enterprise \u2014 and process-driven enticements, according to the publication. Faster permits come with a price tag of zero.\nThat restraint is partly strategic. Hutto, about 30 miles northeast of downtown Austin with a population of roughly 43,000, has been grappling with infrastructure constraints, including water capacity, after years of rapid residential growth. Prioritizing industrial and\ncommercial projects\nallows the city to balance its growth mix without opening the incentive spigot.\nThe policy also arrives as the city looks to reset after a pair of high-profile development setbacks. Houston-based Midway Companies\u2019 contract to redevelop the 250-acre\nCottonwood Tract\ninto a mixed-use destination was terminated earlier this year. Separately, Georgetown-based Headwater Commercial Realty scrapped plans for a 242,000-square-foot industrial project on EDC-owned land.\nCity officials have said interest in replacing both projects remains strong, and the new permitting policy reads like a signal to would-be suitors that Hutto is serious about cutting friction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mars is gearing up for a major office expansion in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market, teeing up what could be one of the neighborhood\u2019s larger recent leases as it absorbs snack giant Kellanova.\nThe McLean, Virginia-based company has tentatively reached an agreement to lease a large block of space at the building at\n400 North Aberdeen Street\n, according to people familiar with the deal. If finalized as expected, the lease would likely exceed 100,000 square feet and further cement Mars\u2019 presence in Chicago following its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 16-story building\u2019s biggest contiguous space availability is roughly 170,000 square feet, according to CoStar data, putting Mars in position to anchor a sizable portion of the building.\nMars recently completed its acquisition of Kellanova, the Chicago-based spinoff from Kellogg that houses brands including Cheez-It, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats and RxBar. Kellanova had been headquartered in a boutique office building at 412 North Wells Street in River North, while Mars already operates a significantly expanded office and research campus on Goose Island.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the\nFulton Market\nspace would consolidate employees from those locations or serve as an additional hub. Mars has been touring large blocks of downtown Chicago office space, according to people familiar with the search, suggesting a broader rethinking of its post-acquisition space.\nIn a statement to the outlet, a Mars spokesperson declined to confirm the deal, saying the company does not comment on speculation about real estate transactions and is \u201calways evaluating investments and optimizing office space\u201d across its U.S. portfolio. Trammell Crow, the Dallas-based landlord of the building, also declined to comment.\nMars has also eyed space under construction by competing developer Fulton Street Companies at\n919 West Fulton Street\n, which could still be in the running should the Aberdeen Street tower deal fall through.\nThe Aberdeen Street building is one of two\nFulton Market\nproperties branded as Fulton Labs by Trammell Crow, a concept pitched to tenants spanning traditional office, life sciences and research-and-development uses. Tenants already in the building include a research hub backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Illinois Institute of Technology and chemical products firm Mattiq. Battery startup Pure Lithium recently moved its headquarters there from the Boston area.\nCompleted in 2022, the building was about 51 percent leased before accounting for the Mars deal, according to CoStar.\nThe potential lease would mark a second major Chicago investment by Mars in just a few years. In 2022, the company announced a roughly $40 million expansion of its Goose Island office and research campus, billed as its largest innovation hub globally. That project opened in early 2024.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

They renovated the home, built specifically for the Osofskys, for two years after its acquisition, preserving much of the architecture.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money was spent on renovations, which included relocating the kitchen and installing a bar at the former kitchen location. Broughman primarily used the property for weekends and summers.\nAmenities include a chef\u2019s kitchen, a private gym, a movie theater, a tennis court with pickleball lines and a detached two-car garage. There\u2019s also a heated gunite pool, an outdoor pergola with a kitchen and fireplace and a separate guest wing.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nick Brown and Lidia Murphy have the\nlisting\n, which breaks down to $3,529 per square foot.\nThe Shelter Island sale record was nearly broken earlier this year when a deal for the newly built One Pandion Road went into contract with\na $15 million ask\n. The purchase ultimately closed at $12.85 million, however, according to\nBehind the Hedges\n.\nOne Pandion was developed by High Line Properties\u2019 Joshua Greenwald, who bought the land for $3.25 million in 2021. Greenwald completed construction last October and rented the home for $475,000 from Memorial Day through Labor Day.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate won a bankruptcy auction for a distressed downtown Miami redevelopment site with a $77 million credit bid.\nAn affiliate of New York-based\nCirrus\n, led by Joseph McDonnell, topped other offers during a live sale last week conducted by Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, court records show. Bidding opened earlier this month with a $72 million bid. The reserve bid was $70 million, a spokesperson for the real estate auction house said.\nA Miami federal bankruptcy court hearing to finalize the sale is set for Jan. 9.\nThe site at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to the 200-key Holiday Inn Port of Miami-Downtown, is owned by two entities managed by Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny. His entities paid $65 million for the property in 2015. The 10-story hotel dates to 1950, records show.\nThe owner before Bomeny secured city approvals for a project dubbed\nRegalia on the Bay\n. Designed by Arquitectonica, the 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower was planned to include 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nThe Bomeny entities filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby the Cirrus affiliate that alleges the site\u2019s owners defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nJudge Isicoff also authorized closing the Holiday Inn upon execution of a purchase agreement, with the hotel\u2019s franchise license set to end on Jan. 5. Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions will receive a $750,000 fee.\nCirrus appears anxious to close the deal, according to a motion filed this week by the firm\u2019s attorneys. Five days after the auction ended, Bomeny\u2019s entities had not finalized the purchase and sale agreement, the motion states.\n\u201cThe delay disrupts the entire sale process to Cirrus\u2019 detriment,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe debtors have four business days after the PSA is fully executed to file a motion seeking approval of the sale. Given the intervening holidays, absent immediate execution of the PSA, the motion will not be filed in time to provide Cirrus the court-mandated notice and time to respond.\u201d\nHowever, emails attached to the motion show that the real estate attorney for the Bomeny entities asked for more time due to the death of a close friend whose funeral service was on Monday.\nBomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid\u2013designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower in downtown Miami, and\nRegalia Residences\nin Sunny Isles Beach.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s tourism bureau and downtown hotel owners are backing an unusual play to boost demand: taxing themselves.\nA resolution to begin creating a Tourism Improvement District, funded by a 1.5 percent surcharge on hotel stays, surfaced at the Chicago City Council just minutes after lawmakers approved the city\u2019s 2026 budget on Saturday, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The proposal would generate an estimated $43 million a year for marketing campaigns and financial incentives aimed squarely at landing large conventions and trade shows that fill hotel rooms.\nThe push is being led by\nChoose Chicago\n, which has quietly spent more than a year lining up support from hotel owners. Backers say they\u2019ve secured sign-off from at least 60 percent of affected properties, comfortably clearing the state-required threshold to move forward.\nThe surcharge would apply to hotels with at least 100 rooms within a defined district that includes the central business district, South Loop, McCormick Place and the\nIllinois Medical District\n. Unlike traditional hotel taxes, the money would not flow into the city\u2019s general coffers. Instead, it would be controlled by a new board representing hotel owners, with Choose Chicago administering the program.\nKristen Reynolds, who took over as CEO of Choose Chicago in April, told the outlet that the additional funding is critical if the city wants to compete with peers that routinely offer subsidies to lure major events. Choose Chicago\u2019s current $33 million budget trails rivals by a wide margin. Orlando tops $100 million annually, while Las Vegas approaches $500 million.\nThe plan has the backing of Mayor Brandon Johnson, and supporters hope to clear legislative hurdles by March. Alderman Jason Ervin, who introduced the resolution at the tail end of the council meeting, could tee up a vote as early as January. If approved, a public hearing would follow before a separate ordinance codifies the surcharge.\nThe proposal isn\u2019t without risk. Adding the 1.5 percent assessment would push Chicago\u2019s combined hotel tax rate to about 19 percent, the highest in the country. Proponents argue the added cost will be offset by\nstronger demand\ndriven by better marketing and incentives. Michael Jacobson, president of the Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, told the publication that more than 200 U.S. markets already use similar districts.\nThere\u2019s also a political angle. By letting the industry self-assess, the plan could make it harder for future administrations to justify raising the city\u2019s own hotel tax. Jacobson framed it as a win for alders citywide, noting hospitality workers from every ward depend on\ndowntown\ntourism.\nEven if approved early next year, the impact won\u2019t be immediate. Revenue collection and distribution lags mean the spending boost could take at least a year to materialize. Still, with Chicago logging more than 55 million visitors last year, boosters say standing still isn\u2019t an option in an increasingly competitive convention landscape.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bay Area leaders may be cutting red tape, but new jobs data shows the cranes still aren\u2019t coming back.\nConstruction hiring across the Bay Area stayed sluggish over the past year, belying local officials\u2019 pushing for zoning, permitting and environmental reforms to jump-start development, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing an analysis of federal labor data by the Associated General Contractors of America. It\u2019s a clearer signal of how far the region still sits from a full construction rebound despite the mounting political momentum to build.\nFrom September 2024 to September 2025, the San Francisco\u2013San Mateo\u2013Redwood City metro added roughly 1,200 construction jobs, a gain of about 3 percent. That increase lagged many large US metros, while other parts of the Bay Area fared worse. Construction employment barely budged in San Jose and declined outright in Oakland, Fremont and Berkeley.\nNationally, construction employment\ngrew\n, up roughly 33,000 jobs year over year, marking the first year-over-year gain below 100,000 in four years. The national gains were largely concentrated in infrastructure, manufacturing and data-center hubs rather than in coastal housing markets.\nRoughly half of US metro areas added construction jobs over the same period, led by markets like Washington, DC, Charlotte and Boise, where those kinds of projects are driving steady work. The Bay Area\u2019s development slowdown, meanwhile, continues to weigh on employment amid acute demand for housing and commercial space.\nSome of the reforms Bay Area leaders and Sacramento pushed during that period were\nsignificant on paper\n, including strengthened\nBuilder\u2019s Remedy\nenforcement,\nexpanded permitting\nunder SB 35 and other laws aimed at speeding approval for housing when cities fail to meet state mandates.\nBut developers and builders say those changes have yet to translate into enough shovel-ready work to buoy hiring numbers. Contractors, according to the Business Times, say the job numbers mirror reality on the ground.\nHospital projects and public-sector work have provided some stability, including a recently completed $176 million health campus in San Mateo County. But private commercial and market-rate multifamily construction has been scarce. Builders expect San Francisco to lead any rebound, with modest workforce growth potentially picking up in 2026, followed later by Silicon Valley as more projects come off the sidelines.\nThe timing matters. Construction employment is often a lagging indicator, but it\u2019s also one of the sharpest signals that projects have cleared financing hurdles and regulatory reviews. Still, the numbers won\u2019t show the impacts of Los Angeles\u2019 historic Family Zoning Plan passed\nthree weeks ago\n, for example, for some time.\nLabor market experts, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, have flagged that the federal government may be overstating job gains further still \u2014 by\nas much as 60,000 a month\n\u2014 after the October government shutdown paused the reports for months. Fed officials have cut rates this year precisely because labor data suggest hiring has slowed and downside employment\nrisks have risen\n, a dynamic that could temper any construction rebound in 2026.The data suggests that while Bay Area policymakers have made it easier to say yes to development, it may still take years (and lower costs, or better capital markets) before those approvals translate into sustained building and jobs.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A path to disbanding homeowners associations for residents unhappy with their HOAs is part of a proposal ahead of next year\u2019s session of the Florida Legislature.\nRep. Juan Carlos Porras filed House Bill 657, another legislative attempt to address HOA problems and help residents clashing with their leadership. But experts on association law say the proposal would cause more problems than it solves.\nThe proposal also calls for creating a Community Association Court Program to focus solely on disputes arising at condo associations and HOAs, a way for these cases to work their way through the courts faster and alleviate the backlog of such litigation.\nAcross the state, homeowners living in communities governed by associations for years have raised complaints of\nwrongdoing\nagainst board members, and in some cases also against the\nattorneys and management firms working for HOAs\n.\nAllegations have varied, with homeowners often claiming HOAs are withholding records and provide little transparency for assessment increases, as well as problems such as election interference, misappropriation of funds, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case unraveled at the\nHammocks HOA\nin West Kendall, where police arrested four former board members and a fifth person on charges they siphoned close to $4 million from association coffers, according to criminal and civil court filings. The Hammocks, which consists of condos, single-family homes, townhomes and apartments on 3,800 acres and is home to about 18,000 residents, is South Florida\u2019s biggest HOA and second-largest in the state after\nThe Villages\n.\nProsecutors in the Hammocks HOA case claimed ex-board members hired contractors that did little to no work at the Hammocks and then diverted the payments to themselves. Two former board members pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators, and the rest of those charged have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\nUnder Porras\u2019 proposed legislation, a resident seeking to dismantle an HOA would start by filing a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners. The board must then schedule a meeting within 60 days and set the rules for a vote on the termination, which would require approval by two-thirds of homeowners.\nThe HOA would be required to submit its plan of termination to the court and, if approved, to select a termination trustee, either the board or an appointed trustee, to wind down the association\u2019s affairs, including any pending litigation and debts, and sell off or dispose of the HOA\u2019s assets.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nIn a statement to\nWJXT\nin Jacksonville, he said it\u2019s time for \u201cthe conversation if homeowner associations are really needed.\u201d\n\u201cIn my opinion, they act more as a failed experiment. They\u2019re a quasi-elected pseudo-government that have more power and are entitled to more rights than I think most cities and counties do,\u201d he told the news station.\nBut attorneys who specialize in HOAs said disbanding them won\u2019t be easy, and likely won\u2019t work at all. HOAs own common areas, including pools, tennis courts, lakes, playgrounds and clubhouses, but more important, the roads, gates, landscaping, lighting, sewage and flood control infrastructure such as retention ponds.\nAlthough some assets, such as landscape trucks, could be sold as part of the dissolution plan, infrastructure would be harder to dispose of.\n\u201cThe association has \u2026 obligations to the common areas,\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets? Who is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nAttorney William Sklar said the bill\u2019s termination clause \u201cwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\nMost Florida counties and municipalities have laws on their books that require for multi-home developments to include HOAs that will own, maintain and insure the infrastructure, said Sklar, of Carlton Fields. HB 657 essentially would go against these existing laws, which would necessitate a massive overhaul of regulations.\nLocal governments\u2019 mandate for the creation of HOAs for multi-home developments makes sense, he added. Because many of these communities are gated, the roads, stormwater and sewer systems are only used by the residents in an HOA.\n\u201cIf I am Miami-Dade County and you want to create 100 lots with 100 homes, I don\u2019t want everyone in Miami-Dade County to pay for that internal road,\u201d said Sklar. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the rest of [the county], so why should the citizens of Miami-Dade pay for every little community\u2019s roads or access?\u201d\nComplicating matters is that some HOAs consist of townhomes that share roofs. Disbanding an HOA may mean homeowners would have to agree on how to divide the maintenance bill.\n\u201cHow are they going to dissolve and maintain the roof?\u201d said Sheir, of Eisinger Law. \u201cHow do you informally split up the tab?\u201d\nUnder state law, HOAs already have a dissolution process. Every 30 years they have to vote on whether they want the association form of government to continue, said Travis Moore, a lobbyist with the Community Association Institute, a trade organization for managers, attorneys, contractors and other service providers to associations.\nPorras\u2019 \u201cinitial thought was to dissolve all HOAs and make them CDDs [\nCommunity Development Districts\n] or other kinds of quasi-governments,\u201d Moore said. But that \u201cis weird because then the developers get to be a local government except they aren\u2019t elected.\u201d\nSheir took issue with another clause in the bill: Starting July 1, each newly formed HOA has to include a statement in its governing documents that it\u2019s governed by the Florida Condominium Act. It would require existing HOAs to hold a meeting to decide whether to also include this statement in their declarations.\n\u201cHe is basically turning every HOA into a condo, which makes no sense,\u201d she said.\nCondo associations and HOAs are fundamentally different, attorneys said. For one, in a condo association, each unit owner has a percentage ownership share in common areas, and in an HOA, the association owns the common areas.\nAttorneys hailed the bill\u2019s call for a Community Association Court, however.\n\u201cI have personally heard from chief judges of several circuits \u2026 say to me, \u2018We don\u2019t need these covenant cases, mailbox color cases. We need to take them out of the circuit courts.\u2019\u201d Sklar said. \u201cSo this is a good alternative.\u201d\nFor both condo associations and HOAs, the bill removes the requirement for presuit mediation, allowing residents to directly file claims with the Community Association Court. Residents at condo associations still also have the option to file for arbitration through the state administrative process.\nHB 657 isn\u2019t the only upcoming bill aiming to reform associations. SB 906, sponsored by Sen. Ileana Garcia, calls for the creation of a state ombudsman for HOAs, after a similar proposal at this year\u2019s legislative session\nfizzled out\n.\nFlorida\u2019s legislative session starts Jan. 13.\n",

        "content": "A lender is placing a bet on suburban retail, as rooftops keep piling up west of Houston.\nDelray Beach, Florida-based\nForman Capital\nclosed a $37.1 million construction loan for The Oaks of District West, an open-air retail, restaurant and entertainment project planned in Richmond, about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The loan, which closed last week, backs a development led by\nFerguson Family Partners\n, led by Bobby and Corey Ferguson, according to a press release from Forman.\nThe project will be built on roughly 10 acres at 21711 FM 1093, fronting the Westpark Tollway in a fast-growing residential corridor. Construction is slated to start in the first quarter of 2026, with completion expected in the third quarter of 2027, the release shows.\nThe Oaks of District West is designed as a walkable, suburban town center rather than a strip center. Plans call for about 87,244 square feet of rentable space spread across 10 buildings, anchored by a central green that\u2019s meant to function as a community gathering spot. More than 15 tenant spaces are planned.\nThe center is already about 70 percent pre-leased, according to the release, a level of early traction that lenders have increasingly demanded for speculative retail deals. Houston-based\nWhite House Global Properties\nis marketing the property according to the project\u2019s website.\nAccording to Forman, the tenant mix skews experiential and food-and-beverage heavy, with signed leases including from Grazia Italian Kitchen, Luckie\u2019s Burger, Pacific Coast Tacos, a virtual golf bar, Pecan Jack\u2019s Ice Cream and\nPicklr\n, which is an indoor pickleball concept.\nForman Capital\u2019s Scott Mehlman, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer and a partner, said in a statement that the deal hinges on a simple supply and demand imbalance. Richmond and the surrounding Fort Bend County submarkets have posted years of steady homebuilding, but new retail has lagged behind, particularly projects offering newer design and higher-end dining options.\nThe loan was originated by Mehlman, alongside Brett Forman and Ben Jacobson. Bobby Ferguson said both sides worked through multiple issues to close the deal, citing Forman Capital\u2019s flexibility.\nThe development will be part of Parkway Lakes \u2014 a 1,300-acre master-planned community south of Houston\u2019s Cinco Ranch area in Richmond. The Oaks will be adjacent to a Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Whiskey River country dance hall and a theater opened by Star Cinema Grill.\n",

        "content": "Retail investment in Dallas-Fort Worth is closing the year on a strong note, with an East Texas buyer snapping up one of Plano\u2019s better-known mixed-use centers.\nCTO Realty Growth\nsaid that it sold the Shops at Legacy North for $78 million, or roughly $321 per square foot. The buyer wasn\u2019t named in the release, but Collin County land records show the property was acquired by ACH Legacy North Texas, an entity affiliated with Beaumont-based commercial real estate firm Albanese Cormier Holdings, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal closed on Friday.\nThe 243,000-square-foot property at 7300 Dallas Parkway was completed in 2007 as part of the broader Legacy Town Center area. It\u2019s about 85 percent leased and home to 31 tenants, according to the center\u2019s website. Tenants include Capital Grille, Benihana, Mexican Sugar and Mic Drop Comedy. The mix skews heavily toward dining and entertainment.\nShops at Legacy North traces its roots to the original Shops at Legacy, master-developed by The Karahan Companies under\nFehmi Karahan\n. That project became an early model for building an urban-style, walkable district within an office park setting, helping Plano transform the Legacy corridor into one of North Texas\u2019 most durable mixed-use nodes, according to the outlet.\nFor CTO, the timing of the sale was no accident. The Winter Park, Florida-based real estate investment trust bought the property in 2021 and has spent the past two years backfilling space left behind by\nWeWork\n. At the end of the third quarter, the company signed a 30,000-square-foot lease with a co-working operator slated to open by the end of 2026. That followed a 20,000-square-foot deal last year for a members-only social club, according to comments by CEO John Albright on a recent earnings call, according to the outlet.\nThose leases helped stabilize the center and set it up for disposition. CTO said proceeds from the Plano sale will be redeployed into other investments, including its Dec. 15 acquisition of Pompano Citi Centre, a 571,000-square-foot retail property in Florida.\nAfter unloading Shops at Legacy North, CTO\u2019s only remaining Dallas-Fort Worth holding is the\nPlaza at Rockwall\n, which it bought in 2023. Including the Plano deal, the company has sold $85.1 million in real estate this year at a weighted average exit cash cap rate in the mid-5 percent range, the outlet reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In 2017, Leon Goldenberg filed an eviction case against a tenant who had stopped paying rent.\nI can\u2019t tell you how the case turned out. More than eight years later, it\u2019s still going.\nThe increasing difficulty of collecting rent is one of the things Goldenberg wishes he had foreseen a decade ago. As the owner and manager of more than 2,500 units, many of them rent-stabilized, he would have gotten out before things got this bad.\nGoldenberg has been\nbuying multifamily\nbuildings in New York City since 1983. He jokes that he now\nowns properties\nin every borough, plus Staten Island.\nA sense of humor helps Goldenberg keep his sanity in a city where everything has gone against rent-stabilized landlords for the past seven years.\nBut there\u2019s nothing funny about the plunge in rent collection that began with the pandemic. Even affordable housing nonprofits have seen collections rates drop by\n5 crucial percentage points\n.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s no reason to pay in New York,\u201d Goldenberg said at a recent\npanel discussion\nin Brooklyn. \u201cAnybody who is a tenant and pays in New York should have his head examined.\u201d\nHousing court is so\nslow\nand frequently unjust that the LeFrak Organization, the city\u2019s largest landlord,\nsued\nto get the courts to meet its statutory deadlines. But the lawsuit went nowhere, proving that those deadlines are not real.\n\u201cYou go to court and the judge says, \u2018Seven months out is your next hearing,\u2019\u201d Goldenberg said.\nThe rough stretch for owners of rent-stabilized buildings began with the\nradical rent law\nof 2019. Then came the pandemic, \u201ccancel rent,\u201d eviction moratoriums, inflation, soaring mortgage rates and insurance premiums,\nderegulation rollbacks\nand, last week, the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n.\nZohran Mamdani, other progressives and even President Donald Trump keep talking about affordability, but the apartment that Goldenberg has been trying to take back from a tenant since 2017 is hardly unaffordable. \u201cOn a $1,000 rent, he still owes me $65,000,\u201d the landlord said.\nAdvocates talk about the need for a strong safety net, but the safety net worked for that tenant: When the pandemic hit, the state\u2019s Emergency Rental Assistance Program paid thousands of dollars of his arrears.\nHowever, as with some\nother rent-aid programs\n, tenants could only get free money from ERAP if they stopped paying rent. It was a perverse incentive, fueled by socialists\u2019 \u201c\ncancel rent\n\u201d movement. ERAP ended, but the notion that rent is optional didn\u2019t.\nUnderlying Goldenberg\u2019s comment that tenants would be foolish to pay rent is a simple fact: People have all kinds of ways to\nlive rent-free\nfor years. One is to repeatedly damage your apartment, then tell housing court you\u2019re withholding rent because the unit needs repairs. Yes, this happens.\nYou can also buy time by calling Adult Protective Services and asking for help. The housing court judge will keep adjourning your eviction case until APS decides what to do. This can buy you a few months.\nDidn\u2019t get free legal counsel from the city? Got a cognitive issue that might justify a guardian ad litem to represent you? Need to care for a sick relative? Tell the court! Judges hand out adjournments like Halloween candy, and city officials will help, because the last thing they want is for tenants to end up in a homeless shelter.\nPerhaps tenants\u2019 most common tactic is to apply for a\none-shot deal\nfrom the Human Resources Administration. The judge won\u2019t kick you out if there\u2019s a chance HRA will come up with money to pay your arrears. If it does, the eviction case will be dismissed.\nThen, after a month or two, you can stop paying rent again and apply anew. Rinse and repeat!\nSome tenants get a one-shot every year. It\u2019s become an annual ritual \u2014 like Christmas, except the gifts come from taxpayers.\nIn theory, you have to pay back your one-shot. Reality check: Tenants living paycheck to paycheck often can\u2019t save thousands of dollars for arrears while also paying rent.\nGoldenberg had 36 good years in the landlord business before the tide turned against him in 2019, so he\u2019s hardly headed for the poor house. But he says 14 percent of all rent-stabilized buildings are in pre-foreclosure or foreclosure, and he expects that to double.\nHis average rent is $1,386 per month. After property tax, water and sewer, heat, mortgage and insurance payments, little or nothing is left. Sometimes less than nothing.\nThe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, he said, \u201chas totally destroyed multifamily, rent-stabilized housing.\u201d But despite the law\u2019s stranglehold on rent, too many tenants still don\u2019t pay. As Goldenberg put it, \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n",

It was a casino.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s plan for a 3.8 million-square-foot gaming facility near Citi Field was the largest new development for which permits were filed with the city\u2019s Department of Buildings this year.\nTwo city jails, a hospital and a warehouse were also among the 10 largest projects proposed in 2025, an analysis of permit applications by\nThe Real Deal\nshows.\nFour of the top developments were residential, though one was a dormitory for college students. After the approval of the property tax break 485x, developers have increasingly favored apartment projects with 99 or fewer units, to avoid construction wage requirements that kick in at 100 units, and steeper rates at 150 units. That may explain why more residential projects didn\u2019t top\nTRD\n\u2019s list.\nOnly one office building made the cut: Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management\u2019s highly anticipated 350 Park Avenue. The project is a testament to the continued demand for class A, trophy office towers \u2014\u00a0and the importance of lining up an anchor tenant to get such a project off the ground.\nHere are the largest projects filed with DOB:\n121-09 Roosevelt Avenue, Queens\nThe competition for up to three state casino licenses in New York came to an end this month, with state officials\nselecting\nthree winners: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, a facility planned near Citi Field; the complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nOnly Cohen\u2019s $8 billion plan made the list of the largest project filings of 2025 (the other teams haven\u2019t filed applications as of the end of November). The development, which will rise on 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field, is expected to include a 1,000-room Hard Rock hotel and a 5,650-person live music venue.\n350 Park Avenue, Manhattan\nThree years ago, Vornado and Rudin announced that they had reached a deal with Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel that would allow the developers to build a massive office tower in Midtown East.\nSince then, the developers have\nrezoned\nthe site and\npurchased\nhundreds of thousands of\u00a0 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and\nSt. Bartholomew\u2019s Church\n. In November of this year, they\nfiled\na permit application for a more than 2 million-square-foot building that will rise 62 stories.\nGriffin agreed in late 2022 to master lease the site, with Citadel and Citadel Securities set to occupy 850,000 square feet of the new tower. As part of the deal, Griffin has until June 2030 to either buy a majority stake in the joint venture developing the property (with Vornado and Rudin respectively taking a 36 and 4 percent interest) or to buy the site outright for $1.4 billion.\n357 Southern Boulevard/\n745 East 141st Street\n, Bronx\nIn October, the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction filed plans for a new jail at the site of the former Lincoln Hospital and NYPD compound.\nThe facility is expected to span 1.1 million gross square feet, including 1,040 beds, 120 parking spaces and 40,000 square feet of commercial space.\nLast year, the city awarded a\n$2.9 billion design-build contract\nto an entity led by the Sweet Group to build the facility.\n45 West Street and 15 Oak Street, Brooklyn\nTF Cornerstone\nplans\nto build 1,060 residential units across two buildings on this Greenpoint waterfront site. The larger of the two, at 45 West Street, is expected to span 808,000 square feet and include 792 units.\nThe other is expected to have 268 units across 249,000 square feet.\n125 White Street, Manhattan\nThe city\u2019s DDC filed plans for the Manhattan jail in October. DOB filings indicate that the facility, which will be constructed on the site of a current detention center, will span more than 1 million square feet. It is expected to have 1,040 beds, 125 parking spots and 20,000 square feet of commercial space.\nThe city awarded a\n$3.8 billion contract\nto a joint venture led by Tutor Perini to build the facility.\n61-06 Junction Boulevard, Queens\nUnited Construction and Development Group filed plans in August for a two-tower residential project in Corona.\nUpdates filings call for 706 units across the two buildings, which will respectively rise 23 and 29 stories. Together, the projects are expected to span more than 960,000 square feet.\n431 East 66th Street, Manhattan\nA permit application filed for the Kenneth C. Griffin Pavilion at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer in November describes a 730,000-square-foot building on York Avenue between East 66th and East 67th streets. The hospital\u2019s new cancer center will rise more than 480 feet and feature 28 operating rooms and more than 200 patient beds.\nThe cancer center will eventually be connected with the existing hospital by a two-story skybridge.\n376 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn\nAlloy Development says its\nplanned\n730-foot tower on Schermerhorn Street, known as One Third Avenue, will be the world\u2019s tallest passive house. The building is expected to span nearly 640,000 square feet and 583 residential units, of which 143 will be affordable.\nThe developers are\nnot planning\nto apply for the property tax break 485x, but will instead make payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\nThe tower is part of a larger development, dubbed the Alloy Block, which will eventually include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable.\n2768 Webster Avenue, Bronx\nDeveloper Mark Stagg filed plans for a 545,000-square-foot dormitory for Fordham University students in November. The building is expected to include 510 dorms and is part of a broader development that will also feature 485 units of affordable housing.\nThe Stagg Group and Maddd Equities purchased two lots at 2740 and 2768 Webster Avenue for\n$40 million in April\n.\n12-18 38th Avenue, Long Island City\nSan Francisco-based real estate investment trust Prologis filed plans for a 500,000-square-foot warehouse in Long Island City in April.\nThe proposal came as the Adams administration began\nadvancing\na zoning text amendment that would require developers of last-mile facilities 50,000 square feet or larger to first secure a special permit. At the time, Prologis said the timing was a\ncoincidence\n.\nThe Adams administration did not begin the review process for the text amendment, meaning it will be up to the next administration to pick up on the effort.\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group paid a record\n$520 million\nthis week for a Brickell assemblage they plan to develop with a hotel and branded condos.\nIt marked the biggest development site deal in South Florida and likely the state.\nThe pair purchased the 4.25-acre bayfront assemblage consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami. Mariposa Real Estate, which is tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, also partnered on the deal.\nThe seller, Denver-based Aimco, has been unwinding its portfolio for the past year. Led by Wes Powell, Aimco is primarily a multifamily investor that last month announced its\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slowing apartment market nationwide.\nAimco first listed the Brickell assemblage for\n$650 million\nin March of last year.\nOak Row \u2013\u2013 led by David Weitz and Erik Rutter and with offices in New York and Miami \u2013\u2013 put the site under contract a year ago, at the time only revealing Mariposa as a partner. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later.\nIn past ventures, OKO Group has partnered with London-based Cain International on most of its projects, while Oak Row has had various partners for its developments. While Oak Row has primarily focused on apartment projects, OKO has developed condos and hotels. Both target the luxury market. Franklin\u2019s only known South Florida investment is his\n2022 purchase\nof a big minority stake in the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThis is the first known partnership between OKO and Oak Row. Here\u2019s a look at each firm\u2019s South Florida projects.\nOKO Group\n830 Brickell\nIn perhaps their most notable project, OKO and Cain completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year.\nThe building, at 830 Brickell Plaza, benefitted from fortuitous timing because it was under construction during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. The new-to-market firms sought top tier offices and many leased big blocks of space at 830 Brickell, the newest standalone office tower in Brickell in over a decade.\nTenants include Microsoft; law firms\nKirkland &amp; Ellis\nand\nSidley Austin\n; Corient, formerly called\nCI Financial\n;\nThoma Bravo\n; Marsh Insurance and Santander Bank. OKO and The Bastion Collection, a subsidiary of Jamal Daniel\u2019sHouston-based Crest Investment Company, plan members-only club\nSeia\nwith an Italian restaurant on the 54th and 55th floors of 830 Brickell.\nMissoni Baia\nOKO and Cain developed the 57-story\nMissoni Baia\ncondo tower at 777 Northeast 26th Terrace in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nDesigned by Hani Rashid of Asymptote Architecture, the tower with 249 units was the first\u00a0 Missoni-branded residential building in the world at the time of its construction. Since then, the Italian luxury fashion house has branded several projects.\nUna Residences\nThe 47-story Una Residences has 135 condos in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nOKO also partnered with Cain on the tower, at 175 Southeast 25th Road. It\u2019s designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture.\nThe tower is nearly sold out, and completion is expected next year, an OKO representative said.\nAman Miami Beach\nOKO, in partnership with billionaire Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries, plans the redevelopment of the historic Versailles structure in Miami Beach into an\nAman-branded project\n.\nThis year, construction started on the oceanfront project, at 3425 Collins Avenue, that will consist of a 56-key hotel in the Versailles structure, which is now a shell, and a new 18-story building with\n22 Aman-branded condos\n.\nThe project is sold out, and completion is expected in 2027, according to the OKO spokesperson.\nDoronin owns Aman Group, with its investors including Cain.\nPalm Beach Residences\nOKO and Cain have expanded their South Florida activity to Palm Beach.\nOn the barrier island, the pair plan a five-story, three-building oceanfront condo complex. In October, they scored\napproval\nfrom the Palm Beach Architectural Review Commission to demolish the existing condo buildings on the site, the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences, at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard, and Edgewater, at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nDesigned by OMA, the project will include 41 units.\nAt an August meeting in front of the architectural commission, a project representative said the project will be\nbranded by Aman\n, but OKO has denied this will be an Aman-branded development.\nFort Lauderdale\nOKO\u2019s plan for the 34-story, 251-unit One River apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale has stalled, and is the subject of a lawsuit.\nIn a\ncomplaint\nfiled in August, more than 40 investors in the project claimed the developer has failed to advance any \u201cmeaningful construction\u201d and is yet to secure a general contractor, three-plus years after obtaining a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan. The investors sued OKO, FPR Investor, the entity in which investors purchased a membership interest, and FPR US 1, the sponsor manager of FPR Investor. Cain is a partner in the project, and wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\nThe investors allege FPR has been \u201cnothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d according to the complaint.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit.\u201d OKO, FPR Investor and FPR US 1 also denied the allegations in a court response to the complaint.\nOak Row\nWynwood Plaza\nThis year, OKO completed the 1 million-square-foot mixed-use Wynwood Plaza project with a 12-story, 266,000-square-foot office building and a 12-story, 509-unit apartment building. The project is at 95 NW 29th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nThe project partners are New York-based L&amp;L Holding Company, led by David Levinson and Robert Lapidus; San Francisco-based Shorenstein, led by Brandon Shorenstein; and Claure Group, led by Marcelo Claure. Claure is the former CEO of Sprint and SoftBank Group International.\nClaure Group leased a headquarters office at Wynwood Plaza. Amazon also took\n75,500 square\nfeet at the office building. Law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg \u2013\u2013 led by co-founding members Arthur Luxenberg and Perry Weitz, who is David Weitz\u2019s father and an Oak Row investor \u2013\u2013 leased a Wynwood Plaza office. Other tenants haven\u2019t been announced yet.\n2900 Terrace\nIn June, Oak Row scored a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 38-story 2900 Terrace luxury apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nThe 324-unit building is under construction on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue. Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development is partnering on the project.\nCompletion is expected in late 2027.\n2600 Biscayne\nOak Row landed a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan last year for the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne apartment tower, also in Edgewater. It\u2019s under construction at 2600 Biscayne Boulevard.\nMore than half of the 187,000 square feet of commercial space at the tower is pre-leased, with Equinox signing up for\n30,700 square feet\n. Coastal Construction, 2600 Biscayne\u2019s general contractor, pre-leased space at the tower, where it will move its headquarters, and Ferraro Law Firm will move into a 28,000-square-foot office.\nFirst&amp;Fifth\nOak Row scored\napproval\nin January for the First&amp;Fifth apartment tower across the street from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami.\nThe Miami Urban Development Board greenlit the project after taking issue with the tower\u2019s design last year. At the time, some board members\ncalled out\nwhat they said was a mismatch between the five-story podium, which had exterior arches, and the rest of the tower, and the incorporation of the historic Salvation Army Citadel building on the site instead of highlighting the building. The Salvation Army Citadel will be preserved.\nThe tower was approved for 45 stories and 526 apartments, though a recent Oak Row news release said the firm is finalizing the design.\nFirst&amp;Fifth will be at 49 Northwest Fifth Street and 50 Northwest Sixth Street.\nVenus\nIn 2022, before Oak Row had escalated to the upper echelons of Miami real estate, it revealed plans for the 26-story, 440-unit\nVenus\napartment tower in North Miami Beach.\nConstruction of the project, at\u00a0 2050 Northeast 164th Street, hasn\u2019t commenced. Oak Row is advancing in the permitting process, according to the company\u2019s news release announcing the Brickell assemblage purchase.\nThe Oasis\nOak Row\u2019s first known investment in Miami real estate came in 2018, when the firm paid\n$14 million\nfor a 1.7-acre development site at 2335 North Miami Avenue in Wynwood.\nAt the time, the real estate industry paid little attention to Rutter and Weitz, apparent novices in real estate investing. Their firm at the time was called Carpe Real Estate Partners, which they later rechristened to Oak Row, an homage to the oak trees that line the entrance to their Wynwood property.\nThe pair developed The Oasis mixed-use adaptive reuse project on the property, where\nSpotify\nleased space for its South Florida headquarters.\n",

        "content": "Trilogy Real Estate Group landed an $82.3 million construction loan for a planned multifamily tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nChicago-based Trilogy, led by president and CEO Neil Gehani, received the financing from Bank OZK, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. The project, dubbed Edgewater 27, is slated for the 0.6-acre site at 2728 Northeast 2nd Avenue.\nTrilogy is a multifamily development and investment company with a portfolio that spans more than 14 cities. Trilogy\u2019s Gehani is also the founder and owner of the Concours Club in Opa-locka, a members-only car club where entry costs $350,000, according to published reports.\nTrilogy bought the site for\n$12.5 million\nin 2021, records show. Edgewater 27 is set to rise 20 stories, with 247 units and 8,000 square feet of commercial space, the outlet reported. Units will range from studio to three-bedroom apartments, Trilogy\u2019s website shows. The tower\u2019s amenities will include a pool, fitness center, lounge and coworking space. Trilogy tapped Coral Gables-based SB Architects to design the project.\nEdgewater 27 is one in a growing pipeline of projects for Trilogy in the neighborhood. In 2022, the firm dropped\n$30.6 million\non a 1.6-acre site at 2201 Northeast Second Avenue, an Opportunity Zone site, with plans for a 36-story tower. Trilogy is planning another multifamily development, the 369-unit Edgewater 23, for the site.\nIn June, Trilogy acquired Crescent Heights\u2019 Edgewater headquarters for\n$41.9 million\n. They are planning a mixed-use development with condos and apartments on the 2-acre site at 2200 Biscayne Boulevard. The project will rise up to 60 stories with 834 units that will include between 60 and 80 condos.\nEdgewater has been a magnet for development in recent years.

        "content": "It may sound like a broken record at this point.\nA look at 2025\u2019s nine priciest deals had Beverly Hills-based Carolwood Estates\u2019 fingerprints all over them. Six of the nine transactions had Drew Fenton\u2019s brokerage involved in representing at least one side. That comes off a\n2024\nwhere Carolwood was involved in half of the year\u2019s 10 priciest deals.\nIn 2025, the brokerage can lay claim to being involved in the year\u2019s record sales of 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills and 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air. Each of the properties fetched $110 million to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s most expensive closings in 2025.\nWhile some have said the year proved to be more challenging in the County\u2019s high end, the following list, compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nResearch, shows what agents were able to still get deals done\u2013with some setting high-water marks while they were at it.\n1. 594 South Mapleton Drive, Holmby Hills | Eric and Wendy Schmidt | $110 million\nIt turns out 2025\u2019s magic number was $110 million.\nThe sale of\nSpelling Manor\nmade for the year\u2019s second trade for that price when it closed in July to tie for the year\u2019s priciest residential sale in Los Angeles County.\nCarolwood Estates double-ended the deal with CEO and co-founder Drew Fenton the listing agent on behalf of a reported Saudi national. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Linda May represented former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt and his wife Wendy\nin their purchase.\nThe Schmidts have plenty of room to work with in their new residence, with over 56,000 square feet. They won\u2019t have to travel far for their daily needs and entertainment. The Manor comes complete with bowling alleys, beauty salons, rose gardens to wander through, library and a professional screening room.\n2. 630 Nimes Road, Bel-Air | James Packer | $110 million\nAustralian billionaire\nJames Packer\nwas so excited over his purchase of the Le Belvedere residence in Bel-Air that he let slip to a\nhometown media outlet\nnews of the sale before it officially closed.\nThe former Crown Resorts chair snapped up\n630 Nimes Road\nin May to make for a 2025 record in LA County, holding the top spot alone until Spelling Manor traded for the same price a few months later.\nSome of the market\u2019s biggest names had a hand in getting the off-market deal done.\nPacker tapped Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Westside Estate Agency co-founder Kurt Rappaport to represent himself in the deal.\nThe seller, a limited liability company tied to European Investment Management Services Inc. with headquarters in Los Angeles, was represented by Carolwood\u2019s Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, David Parnes and James Harris.\n3. 28719 Grayfox Street, Malibu | PDPG LLC | $80 million\nWho ever heard of a surf shack selling for\n$80 million\n?\nIn Malibu, that\u2019s just another day and another deal\u2013altough it\u2019s notable that the late July closing marked the city\u2019s priciest for 2025.\nThe off-market trade was done quietly and involved two shell companies. On the buy side was PDPG LLC, which records trace to a Longview, Texas address.\nThe seller was a Wyoming LLC, called Surfwatch, managed by Wendy Schreiber Fiske, according to property and state records. The company is tied to a Santa Barbara address that Schreiber Fiske owns with Orlo James Fiske, chief technology officer of electric energy storage tech company Gravity Power.\nCompass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo represented both sides in the trade of the roughly 1,300-square foot home, sitting on a 1.4-acre lot. A second, vacant lot was also part of the deal.\n4. 10905 Chalon Road, Bel-Air | RoadX LLC | $67.5 million\nHidden from wandering eyes, behind privacy hedges running alongside the street, is the contemporary home once owned by Dara Mir.\nMir is the estranged husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lilly Ghalichi, who filed for divorce earlier this year.\nThe businessman quietly sold the property at the end of June to a Delaware-registered limited liability company called RoadX.\nThe hillside property sits on a 1.6-acre lot, with the home spanning roughly 30,000 square feet and includes a sports court and subterranean parking.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Ben Y. Mason and\nJoyce Rey\nwere the listing agents, according to the Multiple Listing Service. The buyer was represented by attorney Nima Stephen Vokshori.\n5. 71 Beverly Park, Beverly Hills Post Office | Paris Hilton and Carter Reum | $63.1 million\nAnother celebrity couple made a move behind the gates of Beverly Park when\nParis Hilton\npaid $63.1 million for a mansion in the upscale community.\nHilton and husband Carter Reum reportedly bought the property from Gu Fang, who is married to Chinese billionaire Xu Hang, whose fortune comes from starting medical device maker Mindray Medical International.\nThe couple didn\u2019t hold the property for very long but appears to have made a tidy return on their investment. They bought it in 2023 for $55 million from actor\nMark Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham\n, who had originally sought\n$87.5 million\nfor the over 30,000-square-foot mansion in 2022.\nHilton tapped family to represent her and Reum in the deal: Barron N. Hilton and his wife Tessa Hilton, who were co-founders and co-CEOs of Hilton Hilton up until their departure from the brokerage to Compass in September.\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass and Alexandra Glass were the listing agents.\n6. 1028 Ridgedale Drive, Beverly Hills | Stancheck Capital LLC | $60 million\nWhat a year for\nJames Packer\n.\nNot only was the billionaire and son of late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer the buyer in a deal tied for No. 1 in Los Angeles County residential for 2025, but he preceded that trade about a month earlier with his sale of 1028 Ridgedale Drive. The April closing marked Beverly Hills\u2019 priciest residential sale of the year.\nThe property was once a rental for Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Before that, comedian couple Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman owned the residence for about two decades before they sold it for $26.6 million in 2015.\nPacker enlisted Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton to represent him in the sale. Rappaport also represented the buyer.\nProperty and state records indicate the buyer is a shell company called Stancheck Capital, with a New York address tied to accounting firm Spritzer Kaufman.\n7. 391 North Carolwood Drive, Holmby Hills | David Zander | $57.3 million\nA 1920\u2019s Spanish Villa quietly made its way onto the market for the first time in more than 20 years before being sold in one of the year\u2019s pricier transactions.\nThe sellers were\nBradley Bell\n, executive producer and head writer for CBS soap \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d and his wife Colleen Bell, property records show. Colleen held several roles for \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d including director of special projects, and was later nominated in 2013 by President Obama to serve as ambassador to Hungary.\nThe couple sold the home in May to TV and film producer David Zander, according to property and state records.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal was the listing agent, while Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton brought the buyer.\n8. 942 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills | 942 Alpine Peak | $51.8 million\nNapa Valley in Beverly Hills. That\u2019s what the late architect Howard Backen was going for with\nVilla Oliva\n, which nabbed a buyer to become one of the city\u2019s more expensive 2025 trades.\nThe over 12,000-square-foot estate counts six beds and seven baths, sitting on nearly an acre.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Linda May held the listing on behalf of a trust tied to Stephen Paul and his wife Nancy Paul. Stephen\u2019s family holds a minority stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers and also founded steel maker Ampco-Pittsburgh.\nThe buyer was a limited liability company called 942 Alpine Peak, which tracks to the NBC Tower at 455 North Cityfront Drive in Chicago, according to property and state records.\nCompass\u2019 Carl Gambino and John Bercsi brought the buyer in what was briefly Beverly Hills\u2019 most expensive trade before 1028 Ridgedale Drive sold later that same month.\n9. 11740 Crescenda Street, Brentwood | Davidson Construction LLC | $44 million\nWhen Milwaukee Brewers minority owner\nRobert Beyer\nsold his Brentwood home, nicknamed Ocho Manos, the purchase price was Brentwood\u2019s highest since a $57 million sale in late 2021 at 13058 Rivers Road.\nBeyer originally\nsought $75 million\nfor the 3.5-acre property and then later reduced the listing price a few times, with the most recent cut in June to $54.9 million.\nThe estate resulted from several parcel transactions and their assemblage\u00a0 before a new home was designed and built over the course of about five years. It was completed in 2005.\nProperty records show the seller was Davidson Construction. A state registration statement ties the company to Westlake Village business Transparent Accounting Solutions Inc. and its owner Evan Ingram.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian brought the buyer. Meanwhile, Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Andrew Beyer, Beyer\u2019s son, were the listing agents.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s priciest home sales in 2025 continue the previous year\u2019s trend\nIn 2024, the priciest home sold set a new record for San Francisco and came with a familiar resident. Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, purchased a Broadway mansion in Pacific Heights for $71 million, more than 50 percent higher than the previous home buy record set in 2021.\nThis year, the highwater mark also sits on Broadway, just about 500 feet west of Jobs\u2019\u00a0 home. There were some departures from the trend, too, as this year\u2019s top deal went for tens of millions of dollars less, and the LLC on the purchasing documents was tied not to one of the Bay Area\u2019s tech titans but a Texas oil magnate.\nMany of the other priciest sales this year also followed 2024\u2019s general trend on the high end, with ultrawealthy homebuyers showing an affinity for the heights \u2014 Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights. Six of the top seven trades happened within 0.2 square miles. And, just as in 2024, a prominent sale along Sea Cliff Avenue helped to break up the high-priced home huddle.\nHere are San Francisco\u2019s most expensive home sales in 2025:\n2930 Broadway \u2013 $42 million\nThis Pacific Heights mansion\nmoved in October for $42 million. The property was sold by the estate of Brooks Walker Jr., a long-time business and civic leader who died last year at 96.\nThe 7,320-square-foot home was built in 1928 by famed San Francisco architect\u00a0 Arthur Brown Jr., who also counts\u00a0 San Francisco City Hall, the War Memorial Opera House and the Veteran Building to his credit.\nThe buyer was listed as HOS Pacific LLC, which is also listed as the owner of a home at 2600 Pacific Ave. The LLC has been tied to Joseph O\u2019Neill, a Texas oil and gas executive, real estate investor, and friend of George W. Bush.\n260 Sea Cliff Avenue \u2013 $30 million\nFrom the time\nthis seaside home sold for $30 million in January\n, this stood as the citywide high-water mark through much of the year, until getting topped by the above sale on Broadway.\nOut of all the high-end home sales in 2025,\u00a0 however, both sides of this transaction featured perhaps the highest profiles, and in its own way told the story of old San Francisco transitioning to new.\nFor four decades, the 8,300-square-foot home was owned by well-known developer Douglas Shorenstein, son of famous real estate executive Walter Shorenstein. Shorenstein bought the three-story mansion for $3 million in the 1980s. For years, actor and comedian Robin Williams lived around the corner.\nThe home was most recently owned by Shorenstein\u2019s daughter and owner of the Curran Theater, Carole Shorenstein Hays.\nSea Cliff House LLC bought the property in January. According to public records, Max Novendstern is listed as the manager of the LLC \u2014 a previously unreported fact. A Max Novendstern is also listed as the head of Worldcoin, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company he co-founded with OpenAI founder Sam Altman.\n2440 Pacific Avenue \u2013 $27.5 million\nThis 12,000-square-foot home saw an off-market sale in May. Built in 1906, the eight-bedroom, six bathroom Pacific Heights mansion was the only Pacific Avenue residence to make the list this year. The home includes a wine cellar, staff bedroom and bathroom, and an original carriage house.\nThe estate was sold by Lindsay Bolton, ex-wife of finance executive George Brown Bolton, who helped with Microsoft\u2019s and Oracle\u2019s IPOs in 1986. The buyer was the Aeonian Trust, which is managed by New York-based tax attorney Johsua Milgram at Dechert LLP.\n2990 Broadway \u2013 $26.5 million\nWhether you call it the Gold Coast or Billionaire\u2019s Row, the grand, historic stretch of mansions in Presidio Heights, Pacific Heights and the Sea Cliff neighborhoods are San Francisco\u2019s most desired. Yet, even on Billionaire\u2019s Row there are levels to the opulence, and this three-level home has long stood out as one of the most coveted.\nWhere many Gold Coast mansions were built in the early 20th century, this 10,100-square-foot home was custom built in 1987 for Bay Area power couple George \u201cFritz\u201d Jewett Jr., the heir to a logging fortune, and his wife, Lucy, a prominent supporter of the arts. Known as the last house on Outer Broadway, the home, designed by architect Sandy Walker, has panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, with the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Marin Headlands all within view.\nThe Jewetts had the house built later in their lives to entertain friends and guests. Names such as Prince Phillip, George H.W. Bush, and Nancy Pelosi have all visited the home.\nThe house was originally listed for $38 million when it went on the market in 2024. In March, CI Investments, a company associated with serial entrepreneur Kevin Rose.\n3701 Washington Street \u2013 $26 million\nBuilt in 1902, this 8,500-square-foot mansion sits two blocks from the Presidio Wall. The property was purchased in 2011 by William Matthes, a former managing partner at New York-based private equity firm Behrman Capital, and his wife, Leigh, an advisory board member for Stanford\u2019s School of Education Challenge Success program. The house, completely remodeled in the early 2000s, notably used as the stage for the San Francisco Decorator Showcase in 2006.\nThe property was purchased by Roxy Bear Trust, which is managed by David Geffon, the former head of games at Youtube.\n2006 Washington Street, Unit #10 \u2013 $24 million\nAmong the collection of single-family mansions, the 5,700-square-foot Pacific Heights property is the only unit in a multifamily building on this year\u2019s list.\nThe penthouse unit on this 11-story building was sold by Christopher Redlich, former CEO of Marine Terminals Company, a shipping and cargo firm. It apparently is also the lone home on the list that was sold at a markdown \u2014 Redlich bought the three-bedroom home for $32 million, and initially listed the unit for $35 million.\nThe unit underwent a major renovation at the hands of renowned architect and interior designer team Andrew Skurman and Suzanne Tucker. Jon Rubenstein, the engineer who helped develop Apple\u2019s iPod and iMac, also lives in the building, and recently listed his unit for $25.5 million.\nIn co-ops, buyers sign a lease to own the exclusive rights to occupy the unit, which creates more opacity around who actually lives in the space. Attorney James Burdette Parker signed the lease. His name has appeared on other\nco-op leases for anonymous buyers.\n2750 Vallejo Street \u2013 $22.5 million\nTroon Pacific renovated and sold this five-story, 7,800-square-foot Pacific Heights home in 2023 for $23.5 million \u2014 one of the top sales of that year.\nThe buyer, 2750 Vallejo Trust, managed by San Francisco wealth manager Tracy Keyser, turned around and sold the property this year for a slight loss. The buyer was Lomax Trust, managed by Lonnie Dorn of San Francisco-based Clear Rock Capital Partners.\nTroon Pacific, the seller in 2023, has made recent headlines. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman bought his Russian Hill mansion from the company in 2020. However, Altman has apparently run into issues with the home, and accused Troon Pacific of selling him a \u201clemon\u201d in a still-open lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "A frenzy of multifamily sales in Chicago boosted the commercial real estate market in the second half of the year.\nMultifamily sales made up eight out of the 10 priciest sales in Cook County this year, data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nshows. All but one of those multifamily sales took place in the third or fourth quarter of the year.\nStill, two industrial properties traded in high-profile deals, including the priciest commercial sale of 2025.\nThe highest dollar transaction in Cook County this year was High Street Logistics\u2019 sale of a $270 million industrial portfolio in the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\nTRD\nfound. It was the only sale that came in over $200 million.\nIn 2024, by comparison, Cook County\u2019s top three sales all\ncame in well over $200 million\n, with\nthe $504 million sale of the Sheraton Grand Riverwalk\nhotel topping the list.\nDespite lackluster sales on the priciest end of the market, Cook County still recorded a solid flow of deals between the $100 million and $200 million range. Multifamily deals dominated the market, as the region\nexperienced rent growth that outpaced most of the U.S\n.\nMuch of that is due to a historically low supply of new multifamily developments hitting the market. Construction has been slowed by high interest rates and construction costs coupled with\nrestrictive city policies\nand\na challenging property tax environment\nin Cook County.\nWhile developers may be struggling to get new projects started in Chicago, the limited supply of new properties started to draw investors during the second half of the year.\nContinuing that momentum, already an early contender exists for top commercial sale of the year for 2026. Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, announced Dec. 15 that\nthe firm is selling its portfolio of seven rental complexes\nacross the Chicago area for $455 million.\nThe sale to LaTerra Capital, based in Marina Del Ray, California, and Respark Residential, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is set to close in the first quarter of 2026. It is part of Denver-based Aimco\u2019s\nbroader plans to liquidate\nand wind down operations.\nHere are the top commercial deals of 2025, based on\nTRD\nresearch:\nHigh Street Elgin industrial portfolio | $270 million\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s $270 million investment in Elgin in June nabbed the top spot for the priciest commercial sale of the year and was one of the most expensive industrial real estate purchases in the Chicago area in recent memory.\nThe Kansas City-based firm\nbought a portfolio of about a dozen warehouses\nspanning 2.8 million square feet in the northwest Chicago suburb, paying about $96 per square foot, public records show. Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics cashed in on an upswing in the region\u2019s industrial market with the sale.\nNorthPoint, founded by former Trammell Crow executive Robert Chagares 23 years ago, bought the portfolio for about $230 million in 2021.\nNorth Water Apartments | $175 million\nAmid a Chicagoland buying spree, FPA Multifamily purchased\nthe North Water Apartments\nfor $175 million in December.\nTrinity Property Consultants, a firm with ties to Greg Fowler\u2019s FPA Multifamily, bought the 398-unit apartment building at 340 East North Water Street from Miami-based developer Crescent Heights. The deal includes only the multifamily portion of the building \u2014 a 400-room Loews hotel occupies the rest of the building.\nCrescent Heights secured a $112 million Freddie Mac loan on the building in 2023 at an interest rate of 5.5 percent, maturing in July 2028, and it was assumable by a buyer. That was likely a selling point for FPA, offering relief from higher interest rates in today\u2019s market.\nWhen the building hit the market earlier in the year, the property was listed as 93 percent occupied, with average rents of $3,574 per unit. Newmark brokers Liz Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson represented Crescent Heights on the listing.\nFor FPA, the North Water Apartments acquisition was the latest in a flurry of activity for the firm across the Chicago area.\nThe San Francisco-based company bought a Naperville apartment complex in March for $68 million, a month after it sold\na Downers Grove building to Laramar Group\n. FPA also\npurchased a 500-unit South Loop building\nin March 2024 for $144 million, following that with\na $60 million Oak Park tower\nin July 2024, and\nanother Oak Park acquisition\nin August of that year.\nFulbrix Apartments | $170 million\nMoceri &amp; Roszak sold a Fulton Market apartment development for $170 million in April, snagging a win after the firm\u2019s struggle in the office sector.\nA venture of New York-based Normandy Real Estate\nacquired the 27-story, 375-unit Fulbrix Apartments at 160 North Elizabeth Stree\nt from developer Moceri &amp; Roszak and equity partner Ares Management. The price equated to $453,000 per unit.\nEastdil Secured brokers Bryan Rosenberg and Donald Kelly represented the sellers. The buyers scored a $120 million Fannie Mae loan originated by Greystone\u2019s Eric Rosenstock and Jesse Yodice. It\u2019s a 10-year loan term with seven years of interest-only payments.\nMoceri &amp; Roszak completed the building in 2023. The buyer, Normandy Real Estate, is reportedly connected to the group that purchased McDonald\u2019s global headquarters in Fulton Market in 2020, which was a high-profile vote of confidence in the corridor\u2019s long-term potential.\nLeft Bank at K Station | $151 million\nHouston-based Hines added to its growing Chicago multifamily portfolio by buying\nthe Left Bank at K Station\napartment tower for $151 million in November.\nA venture of New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate sold the 37-story, 451-unit building at 300 North Canal Street in West Loop to a Hines-affiliated fund, according to Cook County property records. The sale amounted to $335,000 per unit.\nThe deal was brokered by JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman.\nPGIM put the tower on the market in June, one of several downtown multifamily listings this year, as strong rent growth and minimal new supply enticed investors back into the market.\nCompleted in 2006 by PGIM and Chicago-based Fifield Companies, Left Bank sits near the confluence of the Chicago River and marks one of the earliest residential components of Fifield\u2019s master-planned K Station community, which also includes the K2, Echelon and Alta towers. PGIM later bought out Fifield\u2019s stake in 2007.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials touted an opportunity for upgrades, noting that about 17 percent of units have yet to be modernized \u2014 a potential value-add play for Hines, which has been expanding its residential portfolio nationally.\nRents at Left Bank ranged from $2,432 for studios to $4,162 for two-bedrooms when the property hit the market.\nFifteen 98 | $136 million\nAmid a busy year for suburban sales, a New Jersey-based firm joined in on the action in August.\nThe Solomon Organization\nbought the 640-unit Fifteen 98 Naperville,\nat 1598 Fairway Drive, from San Francisco-based FPA Multifamily, DuPage County property records show.\nThe $136 million sale price equated to $212,500 per unit.\nFPA had paid $98.5 million for the 34-acre property in 2017.\nSolomon, based in Summit, New Jersey, controls about 21,000 units across nine states.\nThe firm financed the Naperville buy with a $91 million loan from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. The property built in 1984\u00a0 \u2014 formerly known as the Addison of Naperville \u2014 includes 39 low-rise buildings with a 6.6 percent vacancy rate. Asking rents average $1,879 a month, or $2.11 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nMilieu | $134 million\nAmli Residential made a purchase in December to make the list of top commercial transactions of 2025.\nThe Chicago-based\nfirm paid more than $134 million for Milieu\n, a 19-story, 275-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street in the West Loop.\nSeller Pacific Life Insurance developed the tower and completed it in 2019. The company partnered with White Oak Realty Partners and Crayton Advisors on the project. Pacific Life later bought out its partners and financed the property with an $86 million loan in 2021, Cook County records show.\nMilieu includes 215 parking spaces, a rooftop pool and deck and a full slate of amenities. When JLL brought the property to market in July, occupancy stood at 96 percent, with new leases signed at 5 percent rent increases, year-to-date, according to marketing materials.\nThe building is in the West Loop neighborhood which has become one of the city\u2019s most competitive submarkets. Interest in the area is driven by recent office conversions, an uptick in the dining scene and its proximity to Fulton Market.\nOne East Delaware | $130 million\nA California investor scooped up one of the Gold Coast\u2019s marquee apartment towers, closing a nine-figure deal that underscored the strength of Chicago\u2019s rental market and the painful price resets that are still rippling through the city\u2019s investment landscape.\nSan Francisco-based\nFriedkin Property Group paid $130 million for the 26-story, 304-unit One East Delaware\nin November, according to Cook County records. It marks one of downtown\u2019s priciest multifamily trades of the year, yet still a steep markdown from the sellers.\nThe building at 1 East Delaware Place was sold by a venture of Golub &amp; Co. and Alcion Ventures, which bought it for $146 million in 2016 and later poured another $30 million into renovations. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman brokered the deal.\nThe building also offers 37,000-square-feet of retail space that is 87 percent leased.\nThe Golub-Alcion venture refinanced the property in late 2021 with a $113.5 million loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2024. Whether the lenders provided an extension was unclear, but the clock was ticking.\nBuffalo Grove, Elgin and Vernon Hills industrial portfolio | $102 million\nSilverman Group began the year by doubling the size of its Chicagoland commercial property portfolio.\nIn January, the New Jersey-based real estate investment\nfirm spent about $102 million on a 925,000-square-foot collection of low-rise buildings\naimed at light industrial and office tenants in the northern and northwest suburbs of Chicago, public records show. The price was about $110 per square foot.\nThe seller was San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group, which has offloaded a series of Chicago-area industrial, multifamily and office investments in recent years. Stockbridge paid $63.4 million ($69 per square foot) to buy the buildings in 2019, property records show.\nThe properties are in Buffalo Grove, Vernon Hills and Elgin and include 17 buildings that were 92 percent leased at the time of sale. The deal brings Silverman\u2019s Chicago-area portfolio to just under 2 million square feet, according to a news release.\nMike Tenteris, Adam Tyler and Jim Carpenter with Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Stockbridge in its sale to Silverman.\nAlgonquin Commons | $100 million\nA suburban turnaround led by a California-based retail redevelopment specialist paid off for the seller.\nRed Mountain Group and investment partner F&amp;F Capital sold the Algonquin Commons shopping center\nto Nuveen for $100 million\nin September, four years after buying the site for $33 million. The prior owners, Inland Real Estate, gave it up via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut Nuveen didn\u2019t necessarily overpay either. Inland bought the property for $154 million in 2006 before the Great Recession led to several store closings and ultimately Inland\u2019s default.\nThe Red Mountain joint venture spent the last few years on a $30 million plan to bring the once struggling shopping center back to life.\nThe California-based company quickly attracted new tenants, including The Fresh Market, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and a Twin Peaks restaurant. Over the past four years, the shopping center has gone from 60 percent to 94 percent occupied, according to Red Mountain. The firm put the property on the market late last year.\nNewmark\u2019s Bill Bauman, Kyle Miller, Keely Polczynski and Conor Lalor represented Red Mountain and F&amp;F in the sale.\nThe Mil\u2019Ton | $100 million\nA longtime Chicago investor eyed opportunities in the suburbs this year.\nTLC Management purchased a Vernon Hills apartment complex for $100 million in August.\nInvestor Stuart Handler\u2019s Chicago-based company\nacquired The Mil\u2019Ton,\na 294-unit, three-building property at 1155 Museum Boulevard, from financial services firm Mesirow, according to property records. The price amounted to $340,100 per unit.\nMesirow bought the complex in 2018 for $87.1 million and listed it in March with CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck, Jillian Jaeger and Tricia Carolan.\nThe firm rebranded the property as The Majestic Luxury Apartments after a round of amenity renovations that included the clubhouse, gym, coworking areas, yoga space and pool. The seven-story complex, built in 2004, is 94 percent occupied with asking rents averaging nearly $3,000 a month.\nMesirow is doubling down on multifamily. The firm announced in May it had raised $1.25 billion for a new national apartment fund, a 66 percent increase, with plans to target top-tier markets across the U.S.",

        "content": "The year 2025 began with a wave of wildfires that tore through the region, leaving scars that still haven\u2019t healed as rebuilding crawls forward in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nMayor Karen Bass came under fire for\ntraveling to Africa\nduring the windstorm that preceded January\u2019s deadly Los Angeles wildfires, despite receiving advanced warnings from weather officials. She has also been accused of mishandling the aftermath. It wasn\u2019t until the end of November the\nfirst rebuild\nin the Palisades was ready for occupancy.\nVarious people and entities jumped in to help with fire recovery, including Rick Caruso, the billionaire real estate developer who\nfounded Steadfast L.A.\n(He managed to save his own retail center in the Palisades by hiring private firefighters.)\nMeasure ULA continued to rankle industry pros with agents saying it impacted deals across the board and multifamily\ndevelopers talking about pivoting\naway from new construction in the City of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing,\u201d said LaTerra Development\u2019s Chris Tourtellotte on developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles, at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s inaugural\nL.A. roundtable event\nin September.\nLocal and state politicians tried to find ways to amend the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d which since April 2023 has imposed a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on transactions totaling more than $10 million. Bass asked the L.A. City Council to\nroll it back\ntemporarily for Palisades victims, which led to a Los Angeles City Council committee\nvoting in November\nto explore that. State politicians sought \u2014 and \u2014 failed to\ncut tax rates\nfor some newly built multifamily and commercial properties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to be challenging and they really need to fix it because it\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial, it comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nTRD\n\u2019s event.\nVertical construction for the $10 million One Beverly Hills, near the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards, commenced at the end of November, a milestone celebrated by the City of Beverly Hills and the project\u2019s developers. The two-tower mixed-use development includes residences, an Aman Beverly Hill hotel, up to 45 stores and restaurants and 10 acres of botanical gardens and open space. Beverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian told the\nLos Angeles Times\nthe project is \u201can important addition to Beverly Hills.\u201d\nAlso in Beverly Hills, developer Leo Pustilnikov scored a potentially far-reaching victory when a Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the city\nviolated state housing law\nby attempting to block his 19-story, 165-unit apartment building with a hotel and restaurant. The ruling forced the city to resume review of the developer\u2019s project and may impact Beverly Hills\u2019 strategy for blocking other builder\u2019s remedy projects, a California legal loophole allowing developers to override local planning when cities fail to adopt a timely and compliant local housing plan.\nDowntown Los Angeles grappled with a slow recovery in 2025 due to pandemic-related issues, immigration raids and subsequent protests, like the \u201cNo Kings\u201d day of action against the Trump administration.\nDozens of people were arrested following a large-scale U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in the Los Angeles Fashion District on June 6. The raids\ncreated question marks\naround the state\u2019s homebuilding industry, which was already facing labor shortages. Protests resulted in violence, including the destruction of property, attacks on law enforcement and freeway blockades.\nThere was a glimmer of hope for Downtown L.A. when\nTRD\nreported\nin August that there were two serious buyers vying for Oceanwide Plaza and a deal was expected to close by the end of the year. That didn\u2019t happen and the half-built abandoned eyesore\u2019s future remains uncertain.\nOf course the year was not without some celebrity news and interpersonal industry drama that drew reader interest.\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z took out a\nsecond $57.75 million mortgage\non their Bel Air mansion, bringing the total amount borrowed on the property to around $110.6 million.\n\u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d agent Josh Flagg\nsued\nhis former boss, Stephen Kotler, over alleged hacking. \u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d star Tracy Tutor\ndeparted\nDouglas Elliman for Compass after turbulence at the former firm. And billionaire developer Donald Bren\ndisavowed his son\n, David Bren, in the wake of lawsuits in which the younger Bren allegedly used his family name to sell fake Beverly Hills club memberships.\n",

        "content": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d tickled Bay Area readers and\nstorytellers\nthroughout 2025.\nThe trendline has been particularly pronounced in San Francisco, where observers not so long ago wondered whether the city would ever recover from the pandemic.\nThen came the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry to thrust the gold rush town into its latest boom. Employers began\ncalling workers back to the office en masse\n, pulling the city out of\nits extended work-from-home malaise\n. Sleepy neighborhoods such as the Outer Sunset awoke to new interest, and\nbecame one of the city\u2019s most competitive housing submarkets\nthanks to new shops and restaurants, as well as \u201cwhite collar surfers\u201d seeking to enjoy San Francisco\u2019s beachy side.\nTourism even got some shoring up to its\u00a0 precarious footing, as evinced by\nBlackstone\u2019s move on the downtown Four Seasons hotel,\nwhich it bought for a song at $130 million. As one hotel executive said during an industry panel earlier this month, once Blackstone shows interest in hotels, it was\u00a0 a good sign for the market.\nIn this comeback story, first-year Mayor Daniel Lurie has assumed the dual role of protagonist-evangelist. He\nsat down with The Real Deal in June\n, and talked about the importance of getting a handle on public safety as well as \u201cthe perception\u201d of public safety. He also touted his \u201cFamily Zoning Plan\u201d which upzoned a majority of the city for the first time in decades. The vibes, the mayor said, are high.\nOf course, a comeback story requires something to overcome. After shaping the post-pandemic Bay Area narrative, \u201cThe Struggle\u201d still reared its head for readers in 2025.\nThe San Francisco Centre Mall best encapsulated this archetype. Once a trophy asset situated in the center of a great American city, it more recently has sparked wonderment over\nhow low the shopping center\u2019s value could fall.\nAt more than 90 percent vacant, it eventually went back to\nits lenders for $133 million,\na fraction of its one-time $1.2 billion valuation. Whether the mall can have its own comeback story will be a continuing curiosity of 2026.\nThe mall wasn\u2019t the only property to return to its lenders at a loss. According to experts, one-third of distressed borrowers in San Francisco were\nopting for deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure,\nin which they hand their properties back to their lenders to avoid costly foreclosure proceedings. However, developers were jumping in on deals as well. The buzziest buy was perhaps local firm RedCo\u2019s\npurchase of the Wells Fargo Building at 420 Montgomery Street for $55 million\n. It came on a heavy discount for the 12-story office building, a property in which Wells Fargo Bank had invested more than $90 million in renovations over the last decade.\n\u201cMovements of the Wealthy\u201d continues to be another alluring story line. On television, look no further than The Kardashians or the Real Housewives franchise. In real estate, look to Atherton, the Silicon Valley community where $15 million home sales hardly move an eyebrow. However, $51.5 million still means something in the elite enclave\u2013and that\u2019s how\u00a0 much former Seagate Technology CEO Stephen Luczo and his wife, fashion model Agatha Relota Luczo, got for\ntheir Atherton mansion in March\n. The off-market sale might have been Atherton\u2019s highest of 2025, but it was trounced by Green Gables,\na century-old Woodside estate that sold in September for $85 million\n, topping the list of the Bay Area\u2019s most expensive home sales this year.\nClose observations of the rich and famous extended into San Francisco as well. The Shorensteins, one of the city\u2019s best-known real estate families,\nsold their 8,300-square-foot home in the Sea Cliff neighborhood for $30 million\nin January, about 10 times what they paid in 1988. In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\nbought three properties next to his Russian Hill mansion\nfor $14 million according to city records.\nIt\u2019s not just home ownership, either. In June,\nThe Real Deal\nreported that the luxury home rental market has been\n\u201cabsolutely insane\u201d in 2025\n. Leasing agents say the rush for homes at $10,000 to $35,000 per month has been driven by low inventory and more high-income renters returning to the city as more employers have called workers back to the office.\nLast but not least, we have \u201cThe Scandal.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t love reading about a good scandal? Readers particularly enjoyed\nthe scandal of Alexander Beckman\n, the former CEO of the AI company GameOn who allegedly defrauded investors out of $60 million and used the money with his wife to buy two homes in Presidio Heights. Then there was the fall of local Bay Area developer Kenneth Mattson, who in May was\ncuffed by federal agents in a Napa parking lot for allegedly leading\u00a0 a Ponzi scheme\nthat cheated senior citizens and churchgoers out of $46 million.\nYet real estate mogul Michael Shvo\u2019s legal trouble may bring the greatest consequence to Bay Area real estate. In November, Shvo, whose company SHVO rose to prominence in San Francisco after investing $1 billion to buy and revitalize the Transamerica Pyramid, was accused of\nrunning a yearslong Racketeer Influenced Crime Organization (RICO) conspiracy\n. In a lawsuit, Shvo is alleged to have misled \u201cinvestors, condo purchasers, tenants, and business partners into multi-million dollar transactions, the proceeds of which were diverted to enrich Shvo and his associates, and to fund their lavish lifestyles.\u201d The lawsuit was only the latest drama for Shvo in 2025, who has had to fight a barrage of lawsuits, and drew attention for his dramatic exit from a high-profile Miami Beach development.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s largest retail trades of 2025 were headlined by Simon Property Group\u2019s purchase of Brickell City Centre\u2019s shops and a wave of institutional capital targeting grocery-anchored centers and lifestyle assets from Miami\u2019s urban core to Palm Beach County suburbs.\nThe 10 biggest deals totaled more than $1.2 billion, a significant bump in transaction volume compared to 2024 when the top ten deals totaled\n$556 million\n. Investors were willing to pay high prices per square foot for well-leased retail assets with strong tenant rosters.\u200b\n1. $512M | Brickell City Centre | Simon Property Group\nIndianapolis-based Simon, led by CEO David Simon, claimed the most-expensive retail purchase with a takeover of the 500,000-square-foot retail mall at Brickell City Centre. Simon bought partner Swire Properties\u2019 75 percent stake for $512.6 million. The acquisition, at about $1,367 per square foot, gave Simon control of one of Miami\u2019s highest-profile mixed-use shopping destinations in the heart of Brickell.\n2. $133M | Marketplace at the Outlets | Invesco Real Estate\nComing in second place is Invesco Real Estate\u2019s $133.25 million acquisition of Marketplace at the Outlets, a 303,800-square-foot open-air center in West Palm Beach. The June deal breaks down to $439 per square foot, and the price was roughly $3 million above the sale price three years ago. Atlanta-based Invesco, led by CEO Andrew Schlossberg, assumed a $79 million loan in the transaction. The seller, billionaire Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group, paid $130 million for the Whole Foods-anchored shopping center in 2022. \u200b\n3. $131M | Abbey at Aventura | Turnberry, Simon Property Group\nTurnberry and Simon teamed up for this purchase, acquiring Esplanade at Aventura, and renaming the outdoor office and retail center The Abbey at Aventura. The joint venture, which also owns the adjacent Aventura Mall, paid $131 million, or $600 a square foot, for the 219,000-square-foot property. The seller, New York-based Seritage Growth Properties, completed the retail center on the site of a former Sears big box store.\n4. $118M | Uptown Boca | Stockbridge Capital\nStockbridge Capital Group, led by Terry Fancher, picked up the retail component of Uptown Boca, a mixed-use project in Boca Raton, for $118.4 million. Anchored by a Whole Foods, the 194,900-square-foot shopping center traded for $607 per square foot. The seller, a partnership between Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties, Schmier Property Group and Wheelock Street Capital, developed Uptown Boca, which included a seven-building multifamily complex that the joint venture sold in 2021.\n5. $110M | Atlas Plaza | Pontegadea\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s Pontegadea dropped $110 Million for Atlas Plaza in the Miami Design District in the fifth-biggest retail transaction of 2025. Pontegadea paid $5,500 a square foot for a 20,000-square-foot retail building that includes longtime Design District restaurant Michael\u2019s Genuine and a Rolex store. A partnership between David Edelsterin\u2019s Tricap, Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR and Commerz Real AG sold Atlas Plaza for $60 million above its sale price a decade ago, underscoring the Design District\u2019s emergence as a luxury retail destination. The seller paid $50 million in 2015.\n6. $88M | CityPlace Doral | Continental Realty Corporation\nBaltimore-based Continental Realty Corp made its first plunge into the South Florida retail market this year. Continental, led by CEO JM Shapiro, acquired CityPlace Doral, a multi-level 235,100-square-foot open-air center in Doral, for $87.5 million, or $372 a square foot. The seller, PGIM Real Estate, co-developed CityPlace Doral, a development that also included two apartment buildings, with Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Coral Gables-based Shoma Group. The retail component is anchored by a Fresh Market store and CMX CineBistro.\n7. $83M | Polo Club Shops | Publix\nPublix went on a South Florida shopping spree this year, buying up retail centers where it has stores. The Lakeland-based grocery chain paid $83 million for Polo Club Shops in Boca Raton. The sale breaks down to $616 a square foot. Publix acquired the 134,800-square-foot retail plaza for $32 million above the sale price a decade ago. Jamestown paid $50.6 million in 2015.\n8. $73M | Galleria Fort Lauderdale | GFO Investments and partners\nA partnership of GFO Investments, InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance bought Galleria Fort Lauderdale for $73 million. The 799,900-square-foot mall sits on 31.6 acres in Fort Lauderdale that the joint venture plans to redevelop into nine 30-story towers offering about 3,000 housing apartments, a hotel and room for retail, restaurants and office space. The price amounts to $2.3 million per acre. Seller Keystone-Florida Holding Corporation paid $25.1 million for the property in 1993 and was asking over $100 million when it listed in 2023.\n9. $72M | Hammocks Town Center | Publix\nPublix paid $71.9 million in October for Hammocks Town Center in Kendall. The deal breaks down to $347 a square foot for the 207,500-square-foot shopping center anchored by a Publix supermarket. The buyer paid $54 million above the sale price in 1999, when Regency Centers Corporation paid $18 million for the 26.3-acre site.\n10. $68.4M | Village Commons | Kite Realty Group\nIndianapolis-based Kite Realty Group, led by CEO John Kite, paid $68.4 million in January for the 172,500-square-foot West Palm Beach shopping center anchored by a Publix store. The transaction breaks down to $397 a square foot. Kite bought Village Commons for $17 million above its purchase price more than a decade ago. Jamestown paid $51 million for the 21-acre property in 2014.",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s residential market declined this year\n, but the average price of the top 10 public home sales is higher than it was in 2024. Why?\nIt\u2019s not that Austin is a\nK-shaped\nmarket, with luxury rising while the lower tiers sink. Home prices have fallen across all tiers in Austin\nsince 2022\n, according to the\nTexas Real Estate Research Center\n.\nInstead, the trend may be due to\nAustin\u2019s uniquely robust private market\n, which agents say has been losing high-value homes to the Multiple Listing Service this year.\nAustin has always relished secrecy\n. Dallas-Fort Worth has Billy Bob\u2019s, the world\u2019s biggest honky-tonk; Austin has the Cloak Room, a literally underground speakeasy near the Capitol tunnels. While DFW has Reunion Tower, Austin\u2019s most iconic symbols are alley murals, like Jeremiah the Frog near the University of Texas and the \u201ci love you so much\u201d inscription on South Congress.\nAccordingly,\nAustin has perhaps the most thriving off-market real estate scene in Texas\n. That\u2019s why the biggest public sales of 2025, topping out at $17 million, shrink beside the private deals that have occasionally entered the spotlight, like\nEmma Stone\u2019s $23.5 million home in Tarrytown\n, or\nRoss Moody\u2019s Westlake purchase that almost certainly exceeded $20 million\n.\nHowever,\nAustin is now in a buyer\u2019s market\n, and even luxury sellers are feeling the change. Homes that would have normally sold off-market are increasingly going public, trading the tax advantages of privacy for the competitive boost of exposure.\nWho knows?\nAs more homes above $10 million trickle to the MLS\n, a continued downturn might bring bigger sales to next year\u2019s ranking.\nAll prices below are asking prices; final sales prices are undisclosed.\n13330 Shore Vista Drive | $16.9 million\nThe biggest public sale of the year was also the first.\nA Lake Austin estate at 13330 Shore Vista Drive went under contract on New Year\u2019s Eve\nand closed in February after last listing for almost $17 million, or about $2,000 per square foot for the 8,220-square-foot home. The estate of Abilene insurance agent William Kiker, who in 2021 bought the home from Moody International Companies CEO Brett Moody, sold it to an LLC managed by a David J. Miller for an undisclosed price.\nBuilt in 2013 on 3.17 acres, the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property is west of Austin proper on the Colorado River, near Horseshoe Bay. The listing paragraph offered the rare amenity of access \u201cby air, land or water, as helicopter landings are allowed.\u201d\nKuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey had the listing.\n3500 Bunny Run | $13 million\nWith five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 8,600 square feet, the second-place home is comparable in size and location to the frontrunner. However, the property at 3500 Bunny Run isn\u2019t quite on the river, and the lot is about half the size at 1.64 acres. Its listing price of $13 million comes down to about $1,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agents Saira Ukani and Ross Speed marketed the property, which sellers Darren Kocs and Beth Hellerstedt sold in May to Kalan Wagner.\n907 Terrace Mountain Drive | $9.6 million\nMoreland Properties agent Cord Shiflet audaciously marketed the West Lake Hills home at 907 Terrace Mountain Drive with just one full sentence: \u201cDick Clark, architect. John Luce, builder. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so I\u2019ll just stop here.\u201d With four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lot under an acre and 4,700 square feet, the value of this home lies in its historically significant design and its location in West Lake Hills, a neighborhood west of the city in the bow of the Colorado River between Highway 360 and Mopac. The listing price amounts to about $1,500 per square foot.\nA trust held by inventor Harold Shockley sold the home to another trust registered to investor and former publisher Sandra Cunningham in February, according to public records.\n1401 North Weston Lane | $9 million\nThis West Lake waterfront home just missed the\nAustin tech boom of 2021 and 2022\n. The sellers, Paul and Jennifer Gregory, listed the house for $13 million in May of 2023 and cut the price several times that year. They took the home off the market until May 2025, when it was listed for $9.4 million. The 5,600-square-foot home finally sold in September with an asking price just under $9 million, about $1,600 per square foot, to a trust connected to Joseph Lum. Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties had the listing.\n5009 Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard | $9 million\nIt helps to be near a golf course\n. The Spanish Oaks neighborhood is a guard-gated community by the Spanish Oaks Golf Club, offering easy access for whoever leads The Perseverance Trust, which bought the property from Norman and Cecilia Davis in April, according to public records.\nThe $9 million listing price for the 10,000-square-foot contemporary comes down to about $890 per square foot.\nThe Davises bought and sold the property at inopportune moments,\nthough some of their neighbors have fared worse\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home last traded in 2022, the\npeak\nof the\nhoneymoon phase\nbetween Austin and the big tech industry.\nPeyton Tomson of The Agency Austin had the listing.\n5217 South Scout Island Circle | $8.5 million\nBilled by Kuper Sotheby\u2019s agents Joseph Longton and Kirk Lewis as Austin\u2019s \u201cmost spectacular waterfront home under $9 million,\u201d this four-bedroom, five-bathroom property asked about $1,400 per square foot for almost 6,200 square feet on a third of an acre. Seller John Reardon sold the property to an LLC in September, according to public records.\n200 Congress Avenue, Unit 50T | $8.3 million\nThe only condo on the list is also the first deal east of Texas State Highway Loop 1, better known as Mopac. Thomas J. Henry sold this penthouse in the\nAustonian\nto entrepreneur, author and dramatic producer Sir Mallory Factor and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Factor, in May, according to public records. The $8.3 million asking price amounts to about $1,600 per square foot for the 5,000-square-foot condo. Ramey had the listing.\n2701 Slow Turtle Cove | $8 million\nSteven Howse, who may be either the rapper or the creator of Slither.io, sold the 8,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, eight-bathroom Westlake Highlands home to Stewart Hudson in September, according to public records. Howse asked about $1,000 per square foot. Michael Lamendola of The Austin Home Company had the listing.\n2001 Cueva De Oro Cove | $8 million\nVenture capitalist Joe Aragona sold the 7,900-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 2001 Cueva de Oro Cove to Vijay and Rachana Iyengar in October, according to public records. The home turned around quickly after listing in September. The asking price equates to about $1,000 per square foot. Shiflet had the listing.\n3500 Ranch Road 620 Road North | $7.9 million\nDubbed \u201cThe Bond House\u201d for its mid-century sleekness, the 5,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom home was designed by renowned Texas architect O\u2019Neil Ford in 1962.\nIt was also the viral listing of \u201cSpy Kids\u201d director Robert Rodriguez\n, who originally listed it for $8.9 million in 2024. It sold when it was asking $7.9 million, or about $1,500 per square foot. The home is on a lot that spans almost 4 acres on Lake Travis.\nThe Ryan Chen and Chia Jung Living Trust purchased the property in March, according to public records.\n",

        "content": "Two attempts to put a lavish resort on the waterfront of a Riverhead hamlet went nowhere. Thanks to the state, there won\u2019t be a third try.\nNew York State finalized a nearly $11 million conservation easement at Broad Cove Preserve, permanently barring construction on land that preservationists long viewed as one of the East End\u2019s most vulnerable large parcels, Newsday\nreported\n. The 100-acre waterfront site in Aquebogue, once floated as the home of a 500-room resort, is officially off the development map.\nThe state Department of Environmental Conservation paid $10.95 million for the easement, which cements protections on the former duck farm overlooking Flanders Bay. The property is owned by Peconic Land Trust, which acquired the site in 2021 while developers were circling, including one proposing a large-scale resort complex.\nThat resort idea wasn\u2019t new: in 2016, a separate developer pitched a 500-room hotel and spa at Broad Cove before abandoning the plan. By the time the land trust moved to buy the property, the owner, Walo LLC, was still entertaining development offers.\nThe trust ultimately\npaid $11.5 million\nusing private donations and short-term credit, betting the state would later step in with permanent protection.\nThe easement, recorded with the deed, prohibits development in perpetuity, even if the land trust eventually sells the property. It also guarantees public access, locking in recreational use at a site spanning roughly 100 acres, including about 8,000 feet of shoreline along Terry Creek and Broad Cove.\nPreservation advocates framed the deal as a close call. Peconic Land Trust officials said development was an \u201cimminent threat\u201d when the group moved to acquire the land, which sits adjacent to Indian Island County Park and has been flagged in the state\u2019s Open Space Conservation Plan since the early 1990s.\n\u201cWhat was once slated for a major waterfront development project has now been preserved and transformed into a beautiful public recreational space in perpetuity,\u201d Riverhead Town Supervisor Tim Hubbard said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s top office deal this year was Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s $274.4 million purchase of Brickell\u2019s Sabadell Financial Center.\nThe sellers received a higher offer from a buyer who required a loan, but they went with Ortega\u2019s all-cash offer, a source said. Cash deals are often preferred because they take out the uncertainty of closing that comes with financed purchases, experts said.\nDistress was still part of the story for the tri-county office market this year, as high interest rates and remote work trends linger.\nOf the 10 biggest office sales this year, one property traded out of bankruptcy, another out of foreclosure, a third through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and two properties traded for minimal value gains from their previous prices.\nDowntown West Palm Beach, which billionaire Steve Ross is recreating in his own image, is the one submarket that showed immunity to the slowdown. His Related Ross is the biggest office landlord in downtown West Palm, where he has quickly tenanted his top tier buildings at record lease rates partly by tapping his New York connections.\nHere are South Florida\u2019s top office deals for 2025.\nAll-cash fashion\nSpain\u2019s richest person, Amancio Ortega, bought the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell for\n$274.4 million\nin cash.\nOrtega\u2019s Pontegadea family office, which invests dividends from Ortega\u2019s retail empire in real estate, bought the 1 million-square-foot tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami in October. The deal broke down to roughly $274 per square foot.\nTenants include co-working firm Industrious, marketing firm Tibint, Kennedys Law, Law Offices of Wolf &amp; Pravato and commercial real estate services firm Northmarq.\nSellers New York-based KKR and Orlando-based Parkway had paid\n$248.5 million\nfor Sabadell Financial Center in 2018, marking that year\u2019s top office deal. The tower was completed in 2000 as part of a larger mixed-use project that included the adjacent 296-key JW Marriott Miami.\nOrtega\n, best known as the founder of Zara and Bershka, also owns Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, and Pull and Bear through his Inditex holding company. His Sabadell purchase was part of Ortega\u2019s global real estate shopping spree this year, likely a way for the billionaire to quickly reinvest his hefty Inditex payouts to avoid Spain\u2019s high taxes.\nTrio buys Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre\nLone Star Funds, through its real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$221 million\nin February.\nThe 410,600-square-foot building at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard traded for $538 per square foot. Completed in 2003 on a full city block, Bank of America Plaza has averaged 94 percent occupancy over the years.\nDallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds is led by CEO Donald Quintin, Miami-based Highline is led by David Moret, and Coconut Grove-based Square2 is led by principals Jay Caplin and Michael Manno.\nSeller Rreef Property Trust, the U.S. subsidiary of German asset manager DWS Group, paid\n$220 million\nfor the building in 2016. This year\u2019s sale was part of\nRreef\u2019s\nyearslong strategy to deweigh its portfolio from offices.\nFirms divesting from offices amid the nationwide leasing and lending slowdown are more likely to part with their South Florida properties, market experts say.\nBecause the tri-county region\u2019s market got a boost during a pandemic-era influx of companies and increases in rents, landlords can sell their South Florida buildings for at least breakeven values or small gains. Elsewhere in the U.S., they would likely sell at a loss, experts have said.\nDWS sold another downtown Fort Lauderdale office property in the same week as the Bank of America Plaza deal.\nChicago firm buys Las Olas City Centre\nDWS sold Las Olas City Centre I &amp; II for\n$208 million\nin February.\nChicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors, led by Jeffrey Bernstein and Laurence Elbaum, bought the 470,800-square-foot complex with an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas, a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas, a 1,344-space garage and retail space. The deal broke down to $438 per square foot.\nThe buildings were 76 percent leased at the time of the deal.\nDWS bought Las Olas Centre in 2014 for $204 million, according to records.\nWynwood office gamble goes awry\nNew York-based R&amp;B Realty lost its Wynwood office buildings in bankruptcy court.\nSan Diego-based Cire Equity acquired the\n$89.6 million\ncredit bid in August for the 12-story Gateway at Wynwood, at 2916 North Miami Avenue, and an adjacent single-story bank building, at 2830 North Miami Avenue, from A10 Capital. The price for the 220,900-square-foot property breaks down to $408 a foot.\nCire is led by Joshua Volen and Trevor Smith.\nAfter A10 Capital won a final judgment in its foreclosure case against R&amp;B last year, R&amp;B affiliates filed for\nbankruptcy\n, avoiding foreclosure auction. A10 Capital later won the bankruptcy auction for the properties when no other bids were submitted, though R&amp;B was given a chance to refinance its $112.9 million loan on the building.\nAron Rosenberg\u2019s R&amp;B completed Gateway at Wynwood in 2021, just as the neighborhood gained an image as an office mecca amid the influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida.\nMarket boosters touted Wynwood\u2019s newfound reputation as a magnet for tech firms, with some even rechristening the area \u201cSilicon Valley South.\u201d Yet, Wynwood\u2019s fortunes\nturned\n, and data shows tech firms\ndidn\u2019t account for hefty office leasing\n. In the meantime, landlords got hit with higher interest rates.\nGateway at Wynwood took a financial hit when a cyber attack stole a $3 million-plus payment to the general contractor, R&amp;B said in court filings. Later, its construction loans matured just as aggressive interest rate increases started. It obtained two loans from A10, making partial payments. A10 then sought foreclosure.\nCoconut Grove buildings come full circle\nAzora Private Solutions, a global investment manager that\u2019s a joint venture between Miami-based Exan Capital and Madrid-based Advenir Azora, bought two office buildings in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for\n$82 million\n, combined.\nIn September, Azora paid $301 per square foot for the seven-story building at 3225 Aviation Avenue and the four-story building at 3250 Mary Street. Azora is led by Juan Jos\u00e9 Zaragoza and Ignacio Gil-Casares.\nThe deal was a buyback for Exan Capital. In 2020, Exan Capital, which was founded by Zaragoza, sold the properties to Washington, D.C.-based Madison Marquette for a combined\n$47.4 million\n.\nTourmaline buys distressed Coral Gables offices\nTourmaline Capital Partners bought Columbus Center in Coral Gables for\n$76 million\nin March, a year after the complex\u2019s debt woes began.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline paid $290 per square foot for the 14-story building and eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza. The complex spans nearly 262,000 square feet.\nThe previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital, defaulted on its $71.6 million loan last year, and it\nentered special servicing\n. Affinius had failed to renew an interest rate cap, or a hedge against increases of interest rates, for the floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement with lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nMinneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed for foreclosure against Affinius last year, alleging it defaulted on a $68.9 million loan and a total amount due of\n$77.4 million\n, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\nChris Neilson, the court-appointed receiver overseeing Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit, sold the building to Tourmaline, writing in a court filing that the deal \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value.\u201d\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nRyder\u2019s HQ trades at a discount\nRyder System\u2019s Coral Gables headquarters traded this month for\n$70.4million\n, a 13 percent discount from its price over a decade ago.\nFort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate, led by John Goff and Conrad Suszynski, bought the 11-story, 205,400-square-foot Ryder Colonnade at 169 Coral Way for $331 a foot. Boston-based AEW Capital Management was the seller.\nThe building\u2019s name was changed to include \u201cRyder,\u201d after Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant\nRyder System\nmoved its headquarters there last year. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and moved to a smaller space at Ryder Colonnade, citing the\nremote work shift\n.\nBoston-based TA Associates Realty, through an affiliate, paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building in 2013, records show. In 2015, AEW Capital took over the entity, meaning it likely purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, state corporate records show.\nHamilton\u2019s struggling suburban offices play\nNashville-based Hamilton Development bought three office buildings in Miami-Dade County\u2019s Flagler Station business campus, purchasing the seller\u2019s\n$64 million\nloan on the properties in May.\nSalt Lake City, Utah-based Bridge Investment Group sold the adjacent properties at 9675, 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county for $158 per square foot. After acquiring the Wells Fargo loan, Hamilton then took over the buildings through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nThe deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.8 million\n, for the building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.4 million\nand for the one for 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue at $21.1 million.\nBridge Investment paid a combined $85.8 million for the buildings in 2018, records show.\nHamilton was founded in 2023 by former executives at Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development. Hamilton is led by\u00a0 Whitfield and Hayne Hamilton.\nThe deal came amid struggles for South Florida\u2019s suburban offices, even as top tier buildings in prime markets such as downtown West Palm Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell thrive with new-to-market tenant leases and record rents. Aging office campuses in suburban areas have felt the sting from remote work, making them prime targets for redevelopment.\nThe Flagler Station buildings, completed in 2006, 2007 and 2009, struggled with occupancy at the time of Hamilton\u2019s purchase. Two of the buildings had an occupancy in the 40 percent.\nHamilton plans to replace the properties at 9725 Northwest and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue with a two-building, 300,000-plus-square-foot industrial facility.\nThe building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain, recently scoring a\n42,000-square-foot\nlease by the University of Miami for its health care system\u2019s offices.\nSteve Ross can\u2019t stop his West Palm investing\nBillionaire Steve Ross \u2013\u2013 who has at least 11 properties in downtown West Palm, including purchased, developed, under construction and planned \u2013\u2013 added the One Clearlake building to his portfolio.\nLast month, Ross\u2019 West Palm-based Related Ross paid\n$55.4 million\nfor the 18-story, 221,700-square-foot building at 250 South Australian Avenue and adjacent four-story, 669-space garage. The deal broke down to about $250 per square foot.\nIt was the second time One Clearlake traded this year. Seller Bradford Allen bought it for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from its sale price four years ago.\nThe deal gives Ross 7.6 contiguous acres facing Clear Lake. Completed in 1987, One Clearlake sits on 2.9 acres. Ross also owns the adjacent two-story, 70,100-square-foot\nWPTV studio and office building\nat 1100 Banyan Boulevard, completed in 2000 on 4.7 acres.\nRelated Ross hasn\u2019t shared redevelopment plans. Any potential replacement of the buildings would have to wait because the E.W. Scripps Company, WPTV\u2019s parent, leased back its building for a term of at least two and a half years.\nRoss ripple effect\nToronto-based family office Coco Group, led by Jenny Coco, bought the boutique 100-year-old Echo building at 205 Datura Street in downtown West Palm Beach for\n$45.7 million\nin May.\nBoca Raton-based Morning Calm Management, led by Mukang Cho, sold the four-story, 71,700-square-foot building and attached 10-story, 257-space garage for $637 a square foot. Morning Calm renovated Echo in 2021.\nTenants include Stone Point Capital, Alta Rock Partners, Frost Point Capital, Beacon Ridge Capital Management and Bold Ocean, according to its website. Asking lease rates are $68 a foot, triple net.\nWest Palm Beach emerged as one of South Florida\u2019s top office markets largely due to\nRoss\u2019 hefty investment and development activity\nin the area.\nRoss stepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, to start and lead Related Ross last year. His buildings were among the first to reach a record lease rate of over $100 a foot, though asking rates have topped that in more recent years.\nSource(s): TRD analysis of deals reported by TRD, Colliers, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Commercial Observer.\n",

        "content": "Rents in New York City are\nreaching never-before-seen levels\n\u2014 even for the city\u2019s wealthiest.\nAn apartment at the Benson,\nNaftali Group\u2019s 15-unit luxury condominium\non the Upper East Side, rented for $95,000, or $288 per foot, this week. For a 12-month term, the price per square foot appears to be one of the highest in the city\u2019s history.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss, John Giannone and Jac Credaroli had the listing. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff brought the tenant.\nSpanning almost 4,000 square feet, Unit 14 has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a great room with triple exposures overlooking Madison Avenue.\nThe anonymous owner of the unit at the Benson had bought the condo from the sponsor for $14.5 million in 2022. In 2023, they rented the same unit out for $65,000 per month, according to StreetEasy.\nThe Benson, at 1045 Madison Avenue, has amenities including a landscaped rooftop lounge, a cinema and a spa with sauna and steam rooms.\nIt\u2019s difficult to ascertain a true priciest rent per foot given the lack of public records around rentals, but several say it\u2019s one of the highest numbers they\u2019ve seen for a standard 12-month lease.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the highest, it\u2019s one of the highest ever,\u201d said Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who releases a monthly report on the city\u2019s rental market.\nThe luxury rental market has outpaced\nManhattan\u2019s overall red-hot market, according to Miller. In November, Manhattan\u2019s median rent rose over 13 percent annually to a record $4,750, while luxury rents \u2014 defined as the top 10 percent of recorded rents in the month \u2014 rose almost 18 percent to a median price of $11,500.\nOne of the most expensive rentals on a per-square-foot basis in recent memory was Unit 57B at 220 Central Park South, which rented for $90,000 per month, or $336 per square foot, in 2023, according to StreetEasy.\nThe most expensive rent recorded on StreetEasy belongs to a set of units at Jeff Greene\u2019s condo conversion at\n100 Vandam Street\nthat went for $150,000, as well as the penthouse at 24 Leonard Street, which Zaitzeff also rented out for $150,000.\nFurnished residences that rent for a month at a time can rent for even more.\nWhile cracking six figures on rentals is still rare, Giannone, one of the listing agents on unit 14, said he\u2019s seeing a new threshold arising for the luxury market.\n\u201cI personally have never seen prices where they\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the high $100s per square foot for a rental starts to become like the norm, it\u2019s completely different from what we\u2019re used to.\u201d\nMuss said that they likely could have gotten even more for the unit, which was initially asking $85,000, but were given a single two-hour window to show it. Still, she said they had multiple bidders.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no product, and there\u2019s a lot of money out there,\u201d she said.\nZaitzeff said his clients, who were renovating their townhouse and needed a place to stay, were willing to pay above the asking price to secure the deal.\n\u201cIt speaks to the lack of inventory and people willing to pay what it takes to get a deal done,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Another piece of Chicago\u2019s early skyscraper history is receiving landmark status, clearing the way for a major residential conversion in the Loop by Igor Gabal and Envoi Partners.\nThe Chicago City Council approved the designation of the former Central YMCA Headquarters this week at 19 South LaSalle Street, a 132-year-old building designed by William Le Baron Jenney, widely credited as the father of the skyscraper, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n. The vote formally protects the building\u2019s exterior just as local developer Envoi Partners moves forward with plans to redevelop the property into apartments and ground-floor retail.\nEnvoi acquired the 16-story building in October 2024 through a venture backed by Chicago\u00a0 Gabal that bought the troubled 159,000-square-foot building\u2019s loan note for $4.2 million.\nEnvoi Partners\n, led by Nate Ernst and Cory Faulkner, assumed an ownership stake alongside Gabal in the property, and has since secured permits to demolish the interior as part of a $64 million adaptive reuse project,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nHartshorne Plunkard Architecture is designing the conversion, which will deliver 207 apartments on the upper floors and new retail at street level. Power Construction is slated to begin work in spring 2026.\nCity officials found the building met multiple criteria for landmark status, starting with its historical role as the headquarters of the Central YMCA during the organization\u2019s rapid expansion in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike most YMCA facilities of the era, the LaSalle Street property combined association programming with a high-rise commercial office component, packing nearly 40,000 square feet of rentable offices into the building to help offset costs in the central business district, according to the outlet.\nFrom the 1920s through the 1950s, the\nbuilding\nserved as the hub of the YMCA\u2019s educational programming, benefiting from its central location and ample classroom space.\nThe designation also rests on architecture. Completed in 1893 by\nJenney &amp; Mundie\nand expanded in 1913 by successor firm Jenney, Mundie &amp; Jensen, the structure is an early example of a fireproof, steel-frame skyscraper. Its design blends late-19th-century historicism with the emerging Chicago School emphasis on structural expression and restrained ornamentation. According to Urbanize, the west tower\u2019s Romanesque and later Classical Revival treatments contrast sharply with the stripped-down south elevation, reflecting Jenney\u2019s functional philosophy.\nThe building is one of only two remaining Jenney-designed structures in the Loop, alongside the New York Life Building across LaSalle Street. Though altered over time, including changes to storefronts and the removal of its cornice, the property retains much of its original massing, materials and window patterns.\n\u2014 Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Sutton is going for the jugular in his fight against his lender on a struggling Herald Square property.\nThe retail titan and head of Wharton Properties fired back against the German bank Helaba after the lender initiated a\nforeclosure\non his property at 27-29 West 34th Street earlier this year.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers, Darren and Terrence Oved of Oved &amp; Oved, are now seeking sanctions and attorney fees from the lender Landesbank Hessen-Th\u00fcringen, also known as Helaba, claiming the lender\u2019s move to pursue Sutton was a \u201ctransparent, orchestrated attempt to tarnish\u201d his reputation.\nHelaba initially provided a $50 million loan in 2018 for the three-story building.\nBut the lender filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court in September, alleging the building owner defaulted and failed to pay over $12 million in real estate taxes to New York City. Sutton was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit because he signed a limited guarantee.\nSince then, a New York State Supreme Court judge appointed a temporary receiver for the property.\nBut Sutton\u2019s lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss and are now leveling allegations against the lender itself. At the crux of Sutton\u2019s new legal filings is his limited personal guarantee, which would only make him liable in instances of fraud or other intentional misrepresentations.\nThe lender claimed Sutton\u2019s unpaid tax bill put him in default. But by Sutton\u2019s account, the property\u2019s value was decimated by Covid. The property\u2019s valuation, along with others on 34th Street, was slashed. Two of the property\u2019s prior tenants Geox and Aldo entered bankruptcy, further cutting into rental revenue.\nSutton\u2019s legal filings also take aim at the City\u2019s Department of Finance for assessing real estate taxes on the property as though it were bringing in $6.6 million in gross rental income. In actuality, he claims, the rent was about 10 percent of the city\u2019s total, at $680,000.\nThe property has not received rents anywhere close to the City\u2019s number over the last six years, according to Sutton\u2019s filings.\nSutton claims he eventually entered into an agreement with the city to reduce the amount of taxes owed by millions of dollars.\nAccording to Sutton, the borrower had an \u201cunbroken record of timely principal and interest payments.\u201d\nBut in April, the lender sent over a notice of default, citing the $12 million unpaid real estate taxes.\nSutton\u2019s filing claims the lender was repeatedly made aware of the outstanding tax liability. That liability was also listed on the Department of Finance\u2019s website for years.\nThe lender initiated an event of default anyway, according to Sutton, despite the fact that the tax issues were still being adjudicated with the city.\nBy September, the German lender initiated a foreclosure and named Sutton as a defendant over a limited personal guarantee he signed.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers at Oved &amp; Oved, who have notably gone up and won against sharp-elbowed lenders such as Maverick Real Estate Partners and\nRialto Capital\n, argue that Sutton\u2019s guarantee only applies if the borrower committed fraud or made intentional misrepresentations. They claim Sutton did neither. And all rents from the property have been turned over to the receiver.\n\u201cOur motion to fully dismiss plaintiff\u2019s baseless claims and for sanctions for its utter frivolousness puts plaintiff on notice that its misguided actions have caused our clients significant harm \u2014 harm we are determined to significantly remedy,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved.\nSutton initially acquired the buildings through a joint venture with SL Green in 2006. The $30 million deal included a third adjacent building.\nHelaba\u2019s attorney did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market defied some doomsday predictions in 2025 to end with a strong showing.\nEarly in the year, high interest rates, fears over\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies\nand an\nimpending mayoral election\ndominated headlines. Despite reported concerns of a slowdown and deterrants for wealthy buyers, the borough still nabbed its second-biggest period for luxury contracts since 2006, when Olshan Realty began tracking data.\nBuyers inked deals for more than 1,400 homes asking $4 million or more this year, up 11 percent from 2024, according to the brokerage\u2019s annual report. The signed contracts totaled just under $12 billion, up from just $11.2 billion last year.\nOlshan Realty chalked the increase up to sellers finally reckoning with the realities of the market and lowering asking prices. The average asking price dropped 4 percent compared to last year. The report also pointed to a strong year for Wall Street as a bolster to the market.\nFor every one co-op to find a buyer, three condo contracts were signed, which has been the case for more than a decade. Half of the condos sold this year were new development apartments.\nMore than 280 homes asking $10 million or more entered contract \u2014 six more than last year, but significantly less than the 400 trophy deals inked in 2021, the highest year on record.\nPriciest deals inked last week\nThe short week leading up to Christmas was a quieter one. Buyers signed just 13 contracts for Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more, which was on par with the last time Christmas was on a Thursday but lower than the decade average of 17 for the week.\nThe total was also less than the 21 deals inked in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe priciest home to land a signed contract was a penthouse at 65 West 13th Street, with an asking price of $13.5 million. The pending deal includes two separate condos sold by different sellers, which could be combined to total roughly 5,400 square feet. The duo hit the market two years ago, asking just under $17 million.\nUnit 11A, which last traded for $6.4 million in 2011, has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a terrace. It\u2019s unclear when and for what price Unit 11B last sold. The apartment features two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a wraparound terrace.\nAmenities in the 77-residence building, known as the Greenwich, include doormen, a gym and a children\u2019s playroom.\nNest Seekers\u2019 Tamir Shemesh and Patty Lehan had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was a sponsor unit at CIM Group\u2019s 235 West 75th Street, known as the Astor. Unit 723, which spans 3,800 square feet, last asked just under $8 million. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a library.\nCIM Group foreclosed on the project in 2021,\ntaking it over\nfrom Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital, which had converted the pre-war rental building into condos in 2015. At the time, CIM also took control of three other properties that the now-defunct firm had planned to convert.\nAmenities at the building include 24-hour concierge services and a fitness room. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Kyle Egan, Katherine Gauthier and Will Rivera had the listing.\nOf the 13 properties, nine were condos, two were co-ops and two were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $82 million, which works out to an average price of $6.3 million and a median of $5.6 million. The typical home was on the market for more than three years and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

        "content": "Illinois homeowners insured by Allstate are bracing for another hit next year, as the state\u2019s second-largest provider moves forward with a round of rate increases.\nAllstate plans to raise homeowners insurance premiums in Illinois by an average of 8.8 percent beginning Feb. 24, 2026, according to a recent filing with the Illinois Department of Insurance. The increase will affect more than 209,000 policyholders statewide and comes on top of the\nNorthbrook\n-based insurer\u2019s increase of around 9 percent nearly a year ago, the Chicago Sun Times\nreported\n.\nUnder the new filing, individual\nincreases\nwill range from 4.9 percent to 10.4 percent, with the \u201ctypical\u201d homeowner seeing an 8.8 percent bump when their policy renews.\nIllinois\nlaw requires insurers to notify regulators of rate changes, but the state has limited authority to block or roll back increases, leaving consumers with little recourse.\n\u201cAllstate is the second-largest U.S. home insurer because we have accurate, competitive prices and are there for customers when they need us,\u201d the\ncompany\nsaid in a statement. \u201cIllinois rates are being driven by the state\u2019s severe weather events and higher repair costs.\u201d\nConsumer advocates aren\u2019t buying it. Abe Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group, called the increase excessive, telling the outlet that Allstate reported $3.7 billion in profit in the third quarter this year. He warned that Allstate\u2019s move could open the door for additional hikes from competitors.\nThe stakes are high for homeowners and the real estate market alike. Most mortgage lenders require insurance, and rising premiums can strain borrowers who are already stretched by higher interest rates, property taxes and maintenance costs. The outlet reported that in some cases, insurance costs can be the difference between a deal penciling out or not.\nAllstate\u2019s filing follows a much steeper move by State Farm, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, which implemented a 27 percent homeowners rate increase in Illinois over the summer, citing rising reconstruction costs after severe weather. That hike drew scrutiny from state officials. In November 2024, Illinois Department of Insurance Director Ann Gillespie demanded ZIP code-level policy data from State Farm, while Attorney General Kwame Raoul filed suit to compel the company to turn it over.\nThe pressure is building because homeowners were already reeling before the latest increases. A Consumer Federation of America study released in April found the typical Illinois homeowner paid about $1,000 more for coverage in 2024 than three years earlier \u2014 a roughly 50 percent jump, the second-highest increase in the country.\nEfforts to give regulators more power have stalled. A bill allowing Illinois to reject excessive rate hikes passed the state Senate last fall but died in the House.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The\nCity of San Jose\nhas given the green light to a mid-rise housing project on the city\u2019s western edge near Cupertino.\nBorello Asset Management has received the go-ahead to build a seven-story, 118-unit residential building on a 0.7-acre lot at 1000 South De Anza Boulevard, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The Morgan Hill-based firm will demolish an existing 2,658-square-foot commercial building to construct the new homes.\nBorello submitted its preliminary development application in June 2023. At the time, San Jose\u2019s housing element was not in compliance with state requirements, leaving an opportunity for the developer to take advantage of the builder\u2019s remedy process.\nUnder\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n, any policies, ordinances, fees and standards in effect at the time of the application are locked into place. The city was also forced to evaluate the proposal as if it met land-use designation and zoning district requirements due to builder\u2019s remedy, though city project manager Alec Atienza said the project site was in a zoning district that would not allow housing unless it was 100 percent affordable or the applicant used another state law to proceed with development.\nBorello\u2019s plan calls for 44 studios, 42 one-bedroom apartments and 32 two-bedroom units. Of the 118 units, 24 will be available at 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income. In 2025, the area median income for one person in\nSanta Clara County\nis $136,650. Construction could begin early next year and take about 14 months to complete, according to an environmental impact report released earlier this year.\nThe project has faced pushback from neighbors living on nearby Ventana Place.\n\u201cIf the ground sinks or settles due to excessive vibrations or from the activity of lots of heavy equipment and machinery, the integrity of the post-tension slab at Ventana could be compromised, leading to potential catastrophic structural failures,\u201d Becky Bender, president of the Ventana Place Homeowners Association, said. \u201cThe ramifications would not only endanger the lives of Ventana Place residents, but also result in astronomical, multi-million-dollar repair costs that may not even fully restore the structure.\u201d\nErik Schoennauer, a land-use consultant representing the developer, tried to assuage those fears by noting that the environmental report included requirements to limit noise impacts and pointed out that construction vibrations wouldn\u2019t affect the nearby townhome buildings. He also addressed concerns that the seven-story building would stand out among shorter buildings along\nDe Anza Boulevard\n.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s plan is that a street like De Anza will be all seven stories some day,\u201d Schoennauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan adopted by the City Council for decades, so our project, just because it\u2019s one of the earliest ones, is not out of place.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Crescent Real Estate\nis doubling down on its home turf with another marquee acquisition in the city\u2019s most coveted office district.\nThe Fort Worth-based landlord purchased 2100 McKinney Avenue, a 19-story office building in the heart of Uptown, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, citing Dallas County deed records. The seller was a joint venture between Metropolitan Life Insurance and New York Common Fund. The deal closed Dec. 17, and while the sale price was not disclosed, Crescent lined up $170.4 million in financing to acquire the property, deed records show.\nThe deal caps a banner year for Crescent, which also picked up the\n21-story Texas Capital Center\n. It bought the Uptown tower at 2000 McKinney Avenue from German investor Union Investment Real Estate in September.\nLed by chairman John Goff, Crescent oversees more than $10 billion in assets, according to the company. It\u2019s best known for The Crescent, the iconic mixed-use complex that anchors Uptown. The firm originally helped develop the project in the mid-1980s, later owned it in the 1990s, re-acquired it in 2009, sold it and then bought it back again in 2021 \u2014 the third time it\u2019s taken control of the trophy asset. The firm\u2019s local portfolio also includes the\nRitz-Carlton Dallas\nand Hotel Crescent Court, along with office properties at 2401 Cedar Springs and 2811 Maple Avenue.\nThe newly acquired building sits directly across the street from the Ritz-Carlton, with Klyde Warren Park just a short walk away, placing it squarely in the center of Uptown\u2019s office, hotel and luxury residential ecosystem. Developed by Trammell Crow Company in 1999 and designed by HOK, the brick building underwent a renovation in 2021.\nOne of the building\u2019s most visible tenants is CBRE, which maintains prominent signage atop the tower. The outlet reported that the brokerage recently completed an extensive overhaul of its roughly 95,000-square-foot, two-floor Dallas office inside the building, adding a steel staircase, coffee bar with a barista, concierge desk and even a hidden speakeasy. The space serves as CBRE\u2019s Dallas office, separate from its global headquarters at PwC Tower on Pearl Street.\nThe transaction is one of a number of\nblockbuster office deals in Uptown\nthis year, including the trade of\nThe Link at Uptown\n, which Atlanta-based Cousins Properties bought from Kaizen Development Partners over the summer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But a stalking horse bidder has put a floor on what will be a fascinating look on how stabilized units are valued under the Mamdani administration.\nSummit Properties USA reached a deal to acquire Joel Wiener\u2019s portfolio of bankrupt buildings for $451 million, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The deal, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing, is subject to being boxed out by better offers at the Jan. 8 auction.\nThe price point isn\u2019t locked in for Summit, either. The firm\u2019s purchase price could drop to $420 million if Flagstar Bank, the portfolio\u2019s existing lender, doesn\u2019t agree to any acquisition financing, according to court documents.\nPinnacle declined to comment to the publication, while Summit did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn September, an affiliate of Pinnacle moved to auction 93 New York City apartment buildings containing 5,100 units, mostly of the rent-stabilized variety. The auction plan came as a result of a bankruptcy case filed by the Wiener-connected parties in May; the bankrupt parties owe lender Flagstar more than $564 million.\nLawyers for the bankrupt entities blamed financial troubles on high interest rates, inflation in expenses, weak collections and tenant-friendly state legislation; the buildings generated more than $84 million in 2024.\nPinnacle fell behind on maintenance in the affected buildings. Housing code violations considered \u201cimmediately hazardous\u201d increased fourfold at the affected buildings between 2019 and 2014, double the rate at similar rent-stabilized buildings.\nWiener\nbecame a billionaire\nin 2017, despite being a target of tenant complaints and fraud investigations. In 2022, he was penalized after admitting to not properly acknowledging needed capital repairs at a Forest Hills condo conversion.\nSummit\u2019s portfolio touches both the United States and Germany, including regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments.

Completion is expected in late 2027.\nNew York-based GoldenTree Asset Management is the lender.\nAndrew Warman, Jonathan Blank and Paton Marion of PMG Capital Markets were part of the team that brokered the financing.\nLast year, PMG, led by Ryan Shear and Dan Kaplan, paid\n$19.2 million\nfor the two-story, 16-unit\nco-op\nbuilding circa-1957 that was on the site. Across South Florida, aging co-ops and condo buildings have been quickly scooped for redevelopment in recent years.\nThe property has 200 feet of frontage to the Intracoastal Waterway and views to the Atlantic Ocean. Future development that could hinder the views is unlikely because of the Bonnet House Museum &amp; Gardens, a historic home and gardens, to the northeast of the development site.\nDesigned by Fort Lauderdale-based FSMY Architects, Sage will consist of two-, three- and four-bedroom condos, starting at 2,767 square feet, according to the release. The building will have more than 19,000 square feet of amenities, including Sage Wellness Spa.\nPMG has ramped up its luxury condo development activity in South Florida, and it\u2019s among the developers that have jumped on the branded residences trend. In downtown Miami, PMG and its partners are building the\nWaldorf Astoria-branded\nsupertall with 387 condos and 205 hotel keys.\nIn April, PMG scored a\n$413 million\nconstruction loan for One Twenty Brickell Residences with a 37-story, 266-unit condo tower and a 41-story, 537-unit apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell. The project is under construction at 120 Southwest Eighth Street.\nDespite higher interest rates and a pipeline of towers threatening a potential over-saturation in the market, construction financing for luxury condos has flowed in South Florida.\u00a0Last month, Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech secured\n$565 million\nin financing for its 70-story, 195-unit condo tower at 1428 Brickell Avenue in Miami. Also, Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Manuel Grosskopf\u2019s Ch\u00e2teau Group this month boosted an existing construction loan for their St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to a total of\n$418.3 million\n. The two-tower project will have 320 condos at 18801 Collins Avenue.\n",

In 2011, entrepreneur and former America\u2019s Cup sailor John Sweeney bought the island for $150,000 and began developing what he advertised as a luxury club for kiteboarders. While building a lounge and guest quarters, he allegedly illegally rebuilt levees and interrupted the island\u2019s tidal flows, according to regulators. Sweeney denied the allegations and said that he only made repairs to existing levees. \u201cMaybe 100 years ago it was a marsh, but in the last 75 years it was a duck club and dry land,\u201d he said.\nSolano County placed a lien on the property and ordered its auction in January after Sweeney\nlisted it for sale for $75 million\nin 2023. That year, a\nSupreme Court decision\ncreated jurisdictional uncertainty by dictating which waters are federally protected. That prompted a legal battle involving Sweeney that is still ongoing, as he\u2019s asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision that he harmed sensitive habitat under the Clean Water Act and is hoping to have the land returned. Sweeney also faces millions of dollars of fines from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Board and an unmet order to revive the island\u2019s natural flows.\nUltimately, the John Muir Land Trust submitted the nearly $4 million winning bid.\nThe environmental nonprofit\u2019s first move will be clearing the island of human-made debris, largely from the kitesurfing club, including two helicopter pads, a dock, trailers,\nshipping containers\nand fencing.\nOnce the site is cleaned up, the plan is to start restoring the island\u2019s tidal flows. The revival effort is estimated to cost a total of about $3.5 million and take three to five years to complete.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny wants to put the brakes on Cirrus Real Estate taking over his distressed downtown Miami redevelopment site, in a predicament playing out between Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\nBomeny entities that own the parcel at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to a Holiday Inn built in 1950, asked a Miami federal bankruptcy judge last week to throw out Cirrus\u2019\n$77 million\ncredit-bid victory and order a new auction. In a Dec. 25 motion, the entities allege that \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the sale process shut out rival bidders.\nBomeny\u2019s request sets up a showdown before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff at a hearing set for Wednesday, Dec. 31. Isicoff will either approve Cirrus\u2019 purchase or reopen bidding for the nearly\n1-acre site\n, which has city approvals for an 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower with 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAttorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities and New York-based Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBomeny\u2019s entities paid $65 million for the 10-story hotel with 200 rooms in 2015. The owner filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby a Cirrus affiliate that alleges Bomeny\u2019s entities defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nCirrus won the Dec. 17 auction by submitting the highest offer at $77 million.\nAttorneys for the lender sought a court order five days later to force Bomeny to sign and finalize the purchase and sale agreement. But the Bomeny entities want the judge to disregard the auction results and reschedule the sale, according to Bomeny\u2019s motion.\nThe auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, was initially set to begin at 6 p.m. on Dec. 17, the filing states. But two days before the sale, the auctioneer told Bomeny it would start at 4 p.m., the Bomeny entities allege. Then the evening before, Sotheby\u2019s allegedly pushed the time up again to 2 p.m.\nOn auction day, one of Bomeny\u2019s agents tried to log in at 2 p.m. but couldn\u2019t access the platform and was told by an online support chat that bidding would actually start at 6 p.m., even though the sale in fact ran from about 2:30 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., the motion alleges.\nCirrus\nwas the only bidder to participate in the online sale. Bomeny and his lawyers only learned of the repeated time changes because they \u201ccontacted the auctioneer directly and repeatedly,\u201d and that would-be buyers had no centralized way to track the shifting schedule, the motion states.\nAfter the auction closed, Bomeny learned that \u201cseveral\u201d prospective bidders who intended to participate were unable to do so because of the last-minute time change, a lack of communication from Sotheby\u2019s and technical issues that prevented registration or payment of the registration fee, the motion alleges.\nBrokers told Bomeny they represented clients who intended to bid and \u201cstill desire to submit offers privately or through an auction,\u201d according to the motion. At least one of the bidders was going to bid almost double the $77 million amount by Cirrus, the motion alleges.\nIf the judge approves Cirrus as the winner, no other creditors would receive any proceeds from the sale of 340 Biscayne, the motion states. The Bomeny entities are requesting a new auction date for Feb. 9.",

Entities connected to Pustilnikov, Ely Dromy and Eli Taban are past due on about $39 million as of early November, according to Los Angeles County records.\nThe five-story, roughly 30,000 square-foot\nproperty\nat 1315 3rd Street Promenade is minutes away from the pier and home to Holey Moley, a mini golf-and-cocktail bar scene that has another location at Irvine Company\u2019s Irvine Spectrum. Pustinikov and his partners appear to be scouting for additional tenants with a brochure via leasing representative Matthews Real Estate Investment Services, which teases food hall availabilities.\nPustilnikov, Dromy and Taban, who are listed on various documents as co-owners and borrowers, did not respond to requests for comment.\nDromy helms Dromy International Investment Corporation, and Taban runs Big Law Partners and EJT Ventures. The Taban clan was deemed a\nroyal family\nof Los Angeles real estate by\nThe Real Deal\nnearly a decade ago.\nDromy and Pustilnikov have\npartnered\non real estate before. Three years ago, the two\npurchased\nan AMC theater in Santa Monica at 1310 3rd Street Promenade.\nThird Street Promenade has seen better days. Since the pandemic, shops, bars and restaurants have less foot traffic and more empty storefronts. The city council recently approved a proposal to let people buy alcohol from businesses and drink in the open air, but the jury is still out on whether that\u2019ll revive downtown Santa Monica.\nPustilnikov, last year, said he was working with the lender on a\ndefault\ntied to a third property in the area, retail that covers 1241 to 1247 3rd Street Promenade. The lender indicated about $19 million was past due.\nAt the time, Pustilnikov said it was difficult to refinance in that interest rate environment, which hasn\u2019t changed much despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s few rate cuts.\nThe Santa Monica default has come as Pustilnikov has been busy adding new holdings elsewhere. He recently joined with Kaveh Bral and Josh Javaheri and purchased the PacMutual, three interconnected office buildings, for less than $50 million \u2014 a steep discount compared to the $200 million Ivanhoe Cambridge, now La\u202fCaisse, paid a decade ago. That\ndowntown buy\ncame after Pustilnikov\u2019s purchase of the Original Pantry, a shuttered diner once owned by the late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.",

        "content": "Central Health is putting its own spin on the\noffice conversion\namid a broader push for public sector entities to own real estate rather than lease.\nThe Travis County-funded hospital district purchased the Northview Business Center, a 260,000-square-foot office building on roughly 25 acres at 9001 North I-35, according to county property records. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal closed Dec. 9, with the seller listed as Chicago-based Northview Owner.\nThe purchase price was not disclosed in public records, but the Travis Central Appraisal District most recently valued the site at $18.6 million for tax purposes. Internal documents signal a much larger financial commitment. Agenda materials prepared for Central Health\u2019s Oct. 22 Budget and Finance Committee meeting show the district proposed issuing $93.5 million in debt to acquire the property.\nDiscussions about the acquisition were held in closed session, but the agenda documents describe the Northview property as a\n\u201cpriority need area\u201d\nand outline plans to transform the office building into adult and pediatric\nclinical offices\n, along with clinical support space. The move is intended to help Central Health transition services out of leased facilities, though the district has not specified which clinics would relocate, according to the publication.\nThe property is not entirely vacant. About 70,000 square feet is currently leased through 2029, according to the same documents. One of the existing tenants appears to be Workforce Solutions Capital Area, based on publicly available listings tied to the address.\nThe acquisition adds to a growing list of public-sector real estate deals reshaping Central Texas, as government entities increasingly opt to buy large office properties amid softer market conditions. Travis County recently approved the use of eminent domain to acquire an\nEast Austin landfill\nit is being sued over, while the city of Austin has been especially active.\nIn recent months, the city has purchased a former motorcycle dealership, paid $87 million for Tokyo Electron\u2019s former\nSoutheast Austin campus\n, spent $107.6 million on the One and Two Barton Skyway office buildings and shelled out $41.1 million for a 143-acre tract in East Austin. It also bought a 207,000-square-foot office building at 3300 North I-35 for $26.2 million.\nCity officials have framed those acquisitions as part of a long-term strategy to control costs by owning space instead of leasing, arguing that leasing can cost roughly twice as much over time.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In the final days of the Adams administration, officials are dangling an alternative development site in front of the team jettisoned from building housing at the Elizabeth Street Garden.\nFirst Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro gave Pennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester an ultimatum last week: If they want to develop 22 Suffolk Street, they must drop their lawsuit against the city.\nThe city-owned site is being offered in exchange for the development team abandoning its legal fight over the Elizabeth Street Garden. The city tapped the developers in 2017 to build 123 units of senior housing at the garden site, a project known as Haven Green.\nFor years, the city fended off litigation over the site\u2019s future, and after a key legal victory in 2024, the Adams administration moved forward with plans to\nevict\nthe garden. But soon after Mastro joined the administration, City Hall reversed course.\nIn June, the administration\nannounced\nthat it would leave the garden intact and would instead move forward with housing projects on three other sites: 22 Suffolk Street, 156-166 Bowery Street and 100 Gold Street. Projects on those sites, which need to be rezoned, would net thousands of housing units, including hundreds more affordable units than planned for the garden site.\nAfter Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made clear that he would\nevict\nthe garden once in office, the Adams administration designated the city-owned site as parkland. At the time, Mamani said that undoing the action would prove nearly impossible because it would require buy-in from the state legislature.\nHowever, the development team\nsued\nthe city in November, arguing that the administration couldn\u2019t unilaterally declare the site a city park. Such a land-use change would need to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park, according to the lawsuit.\nIn a letter sent to the development team on Friday, Mastro said the city will designate the companies as the developers of 200 affordable housing units at 22 Suffolk Street as long as they drop their lawsuit by Dec. 31.\nIf the team doesn\u2019t abandon its lawsuit, the city will find another development partner, the letter states.\nMessages to representatives and attorneys for the developers were not immediately returned. A City Hall spokesperson could not immediately provide an explanation as to why the development of the Suffolk site was not decided by a public bidding process.\n\u201cWe hope this group of developers accepts our offer, so together, we can deliver on the Adams administration\u2019s promise to provide a win-win solution for the Elizabeth Street Garden \u2013 preserving cherished community green space while also building far more affordable housing than the 123 units originally contemplated at the garden site alone,\u201d Mastro said in a statement.\nOn Monday, the administration also announced that it had reached a licensing agreement with the nonprofit Elizabeth Street Garden to continue operating the park through the next 10 years, with the option of two five-year extensions.\nThe nonprofit has also agreed to pay $100,000 it owes in back rent for the site, in 10 annual installments over the next decade (the first $10,000 payment is due this week).\nIt\u2019s not clear how the development team will proceed. In November, the developers agreed to\npause\ntheir lawsuit as they negotiated with the city over the Suffolk site. In a Dec. 19 letter, the administration authorized the development team to seek financing for the Suffolk site, but Mastro said the lawsuit \u201cmaterially undermines the City\u2019s ability to maintain the confirmations of support and approvals necessary to advance the Suffolk Street project.\u201d\nHe was referring to an agreement reached with Council member Chris Marte to ensure his support of rezoning the Suffolk Street site, as well as the other planned rezonings, in exchange for leaving Elizabeth Street Garden alone.\nMarte was the sole Manhattan Council member to vote against the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity and previously spoke out against the rezoning planned for 100 Gold Street. Mastro said the three substitute projects would be dead on arrival without Marte\u2019s support, though the passage of ballot measures that\nweaken\nthe City Council\u2019s tradition of member deference may have changed the power dynamics for these rezonings.\nThe Adams administration\u2019s reversal on the Elizabeth Street Garden project raised questions about the risk of partnering with the city on projects. It also traded a project that was closer to shovel-ready for three that need to go through the city\u2019s land-use review process and will be the responsibility of the next administration to push forward.\nThe project\u2019s trajectory also complicates Adams\u2019 housing legacy, which included several initiatives aimed at building more housing throughout the city. The decision to drop Haven Green drew sharp criticism from housing groups, elected officials and developers who saw it as a hypocritical acquiescence to wealthy and celebrity interests.\nProponents of the garden saw the deal with Marte as a vindication of their long-standing argument that the city could find other, better sites for housing while leaving the park alone.\n",

        "content": "Another surface parking lot in River North is officially on the clock.\nA full building permit has been issued for ZSD\u2019s mixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot \u2014 a fading but still familiar sight in one of downtown Chicago\u2019s most built-out neighborhoods, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n.\nWith caisson and foundation permits already in hand, the final approval allows ZSD, described as a boutique real estate developer on its website, to build the project from top to bottom.\nZSD\n, led by\nZev Salomon\n, bought the parcel for $9 million in April, acquiring it from North Wells Capital, which paid nearly double that price in 2019 and had once pitched a 24-story office building for the site.\nConstruction is expected to kick off imminently, with completion targeted for 2027.\nThe building will occupy nearly the entire site, broken only by a narrow strip of green space along\nNorth Orleans Street\nand a small portion of the western edge carved off into a separate parcel. Urbanize reported that the massing is a clean rectangle, articulated with a mix of facade treatments intended to break down its scale. Plans call for black and dark gray standing-seam siding, random-pattern box rib metal panels and brick cladding at the first two floors, including at the main entry and along the ground-floor residential units.\nStreet-level tenants will be\u00a0 concentrated along Franklin and Huron. Two retail spaces will anchor the corner, while the residential entry sits just west of the storefronts. Inside, residents will access a lobby, management office, package and mail rooms and bike storage.\nThe western end of the ground floor is reserved for 11 duplex units, a design choice that brings a more townhouse-like feel to the block. Those units will feature recessed private terraces facing both the street and the alley, buffered from pedestrians by screening and planters rather than blank walls.\nThe 149 apartments skew toward smaller layouts, reflecting both\nRiver North\ndemand and current financing realities. The mix includes 48 studios and 78 one-bedrooms, alongside 12 two-bedrooms. The duplex inventory adds seven one-bedroom and four two-bedroom units.\nAmenities are stacked at the top of the building, where residents will have access to an indoor lounge, private gathering space, coworking area and fitness center. An outdoor roof deck rounds out the package with lounge seating, fire pits and grilling areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Avdoo is looking to capitalize on a rising corner of Lower Manhattan.\nShlomi Avdoo\u2019s firm paid $63 million for a 12,500-square-foot lot on the corner of King and Varick streets in the Hudson Square neighborhood. Valley National Bank financed the purchase with a $40 million loan.\nThe site has over 125,000 square feet of development rights. Avdoo plans to pursue additional floor area through air-rights deals and a transit-related bonus tied to infrastructure improvements.\nThe final shape of the project will depend on the additional development rights Avdoo secures, but the developer said he is targeting high-end residential spanning more than 200,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe neighborhood is changing so quickly, and there\u2019s really no supply,\u201d said Avdoo.\nHudson Square, a newly minted Lower Manhattan neighborhood that sits adjacent to Tribeca, Soho and the West Village, has emerged as an appealing area for developers looking to capitalize on the wealthy buyers\nflocking to downtown\nin recent years.\nAvdoo\u2019s site at 68 King Street falls just outside of the Greenwich Village Historic District, which has limited most residential development on the west side.\n\u201cWhen you look at people who want to live Downtown, who want to live in Soho, want to live in the West Village, they don\u2019t have many options,\u201d Avdoo said. Because of the limited development options in the area, Avdoo said securing the site was \u201cone of the most competitive processes\u201d he\u2019s seen.\nThe site is blocks away from where major corporations like\nGoogle and Disney\nhave set up shop in recent years, one of the biggest factors that has enticed not just developers, but restaurateurs and retailers to look at opening stores in the once-sleepy neighborhood.\nAvdoo\u2019s purchase also comes after nearly one year of sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury development from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development that is also just a few blocks from 68 King.\nWhile the building has not yet publicly shared sales numbers, the 112-unit development has reportedly been a\nmagnet for wealthy buyers\ntrying to enter the Downtown market. Earlier this month, the building put multiple units into contract for\n$129 million\n, which would far surpass previous sales records Downtown if the deal closes at that price.\nFor Avdoo, the deal is the latest in a string of activity across Manhattan and Brooklyn. In February, the firm paid\n$52 million\nfor five buildings on the Upper East Side, its first project in the neighborhood.\nIt has also launched sales at its 21-unit development at\n110 Boerum Place\nin Cobble Hill and started closings at the\nBergen\n, a 105-unit project at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\n",

It is in the Continuum\u2019s 42-story south tower, which Ian Bruce Eichner developed in 2002. He completed the 37-story north tower in 2008.

Shortly after, Fort sold a pair of units to billionaire Pablo Legorreta for\na combined $68.7 million\n.On Fisher Island, Andrew Zaro of the Zaro\u2019s Bakery family in New York\npaid $35.2 million\nfor a penthouse at Palazzo Del Sol this month, making it the private island\u2019s most expensive condo sale this year.",

The records reportedly found dozens of instances in which inspectors flagged crews for allegedly cutting corners, including dumping ash on neighboring parcels, reusing contaminated soil and leaving debris buried on sites cleared for reconstruction.\nEnvironmental Chemical Corporation denied authorizing such practices.\n\u201cAt a high level, ECC does not authorize the placement of wildfire debris or ash on neighboring properties, does not permit the use of contaminated material as fill, and operates under continuous [Army Corps] oversight,\u201d Glenn Sweatt, the Burlingame-based company\u2019s vice president of contracts and compliance, told the Times.\nOverall, FEMA and the Army Corps allocated $60 million to hire personnel to monitor daily cleanup operations and document any health and safety risks observed in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones between February and May.\nOne report cited an April incident in the\nPacific Palisades\nwhere inspectors said workers ordered by an Environmental Chemical Corporation official moved several buckets of fire debris onto an adjacent property after a cleanup truck had already departed. Other reports described crews using ash-contaminated soil to fill holes on fire-damaged properties, which would be a direct violation of state policy prohibiting contaminated material from being reused on site. Inspectors also cited workers for recontaminating cleared lots by walking through them with dirty boot covers, spraying polluted pool water onto neighboring properties and into storm drains and mixing clean and toxic soil with improper excavation equipment.\nThe Army Corps responded to nearly 1,100 public complaints related to the\nfederal fire cleanup\nbetween February and September. More than 20 percent of those were related to quality of work, with some of them aligning with the same issues inspectors pointed out, according to the Army Corps.\nU.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, who represents Los Angeles, wants authorities to investigate further.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to press the Army Corps to look at where the testing indicates there [were] still contaminants and who is the contractor for that, to see whether there are certain contractors that had a high failure rate,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI want to make sure they\u2019re\u2026 evaluating these contractors vis-\u00e0-vis the next disaster.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lift Partners is buying back an industrial building in the Peninsula after four years under different ownership.\nThe San Francisco-based firm acquired 100 Utah Avenue in South San Francisco in a sale-leaseback deal for $31.8 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe seller of the 4.4-acre property was Goodwill San Francisco Bay, which anchors the site and holds a short-term lease there. Lift owned the 120,000-square-foot building from 2018 to 2021 before selling it to\nGoodwill\n.\nLift Partners\u2019 purchase of the property comes after the company closed its fourth discretionary fund, which provided Lift with about $500 million in new capital to deploy for acquisitions such as these. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on hyper-infill opportunities along the West Coast \u2014 Southern California and the Bay Area right now,\u201d Patrick Fisher, a managing partner at Lift, told the Business Times, noting the influx of \u201ca diverse mix of tenants.\u201d\nLift has made a play in the Peninsula in the past. In 2022, the real estate firm paid approximately $10.8 million for a vacant 39,560-square-foot industrial building at\n3575 Haven Avenue in Menlo Park\n. It bought that property using its third discretionary fund, valued at $205 million. The company also owns the 21,906-square-foot 2500 Old Middlefield Way building in Mountain View, which it acquired in 2018.\nThe Peninsula industrial property market has been attracting large investors as logistics space becomes an increasingly hot commodity in the Bay Area. Last month,\nPrologis\n\u2014 the world\u2019s largest industrial real estate company \u2014 spent $314.5 million for an 11-building portfolio in\nCrocker Industrial Park in Brisbane\n, the neighboring city north of South San Francisco. That transaction marked the largest industrial property deal in the Bay Area this year.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, the Peninsula had about 800,000 square feet of active industrial tenant demand, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Journal. Industrial availability was approximately 7 percent and vacancy was about 5.5 percent, which are notably low figures when compared to the rest of the region, per CBRE. At the same time, industrial supply in the Peninsula has continued to shrink.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A champion of\ndowntown Dallas\nis walking away from one of the urban core\u2019s most ambitious redevelopment projects.\nDeveloper Shawn Todd\u2019s firm, Todd Interests is selling its ownership stake in the East Quarter district to partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management, effectively exiting the 20-acre project they launched in 2018. Dallas Morning News got\nconfirmation\nof the deal from Todd, who told the outlet that it is expected to close imminently. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nThe move hands full control of the growing district on the eastern edge of downtown to the global asset manager and marks the end of a partnership that began in 2018. East Quarter was developed by Todd alongside his sons, Philip Todd, the firm\u2019s CEO, and Patrick Todd, a partner at the company.\nOver several years,\nTodd Interests\nassembled more than 30 properties across eight city blocks, stitching together a mix of 1920s and 1930s-era buildings along Cesar Chavez Boulevard, Commerce Street and Jackson Street. The firm repositioned the former industrial and warehouse stock into offices, restaurants and creative space, aiming to bridge downtown\u2019s core with Deep Ellum\u2019s nightlife and residential growth. It also built the 20-story office tower at 300 South Pearl Street.\nThe redevelopment of the East Quarter benefited from the nearby revamp of the Dallas Farmers Market, in which a coalition of investors turned four neglected sheds sitting on 17 underused acres into an open-air pavilion, a food hall, retail and multifamily.\nHow much J.P. Morgan is paying for Todd\u2019s stake remains unclear, but the district is no small asset. Tax records and estimates from Partners Real Estate senior vice president Steve Triolet indicate the district could be worth anywhere from $200 million to more than $300 million, depending on assumptions around income and future development.\nThe buyout comes as J.P. Morgan wraps up its involvement in another high-profile Dallas investment. It acquired a 60 percent stake in\nNorthPark Center\nin 2014 for $362 million. That partnership ended earlier this year, when J.P. Morgan was bought out of its interest in the luxury shopping center.\nThe exit comes after a string of major, capital-intensive downtown projects for Todd Interests. The firm led the roughly $300 million renovation of\nEnergy Plaza\n, rebranding the 49-story, I.M. Pei\u2013designed tower as The Sinclair and converting it into a mix of residential and office space. Todd and partners also spearheaded the $460 million redevelopment of the First National Bank tower, transforming the historic skyscraper into apartments, offices, retail and a luxury hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What do luggage carts have to do with real estate? Glad you asked.\nIf you can understand politics and economics, you can understand much of what happens in the world. A common sentiment in New York politics is that people should get things for less than they cost, or even free. This explains rent stabilization, at least\nsince 2019\n.\nBut today\u2019s example is the humble airport luggage cart.\nTim Wu, the semi-famous Columbia professor (of law, not economics),\ntweeted\nthat a $6 fee for carts at Kennedy Airport \u201cjust feels extractive\u201d to a family with a lot of luggage.\n\u201cNothing says \u2018welcome to the land of the price gouge\u2019 like the JFK $6 fee for the luggage carts that are free in the rest of the civilized world,\u201d he wrote.\nFirst of all, America is not \u201cthe land of the price gouge.\u201d Lots of things \u2014 gas, gadgets, groceries, blue jeans \u2014 are\ncheaper here\nthan in other developed countries.\nSecond, the $6 fee for luggage carts makes perfect sense. It ensures that people who truly value carts will be able to get them and are the only ones paying for them.\nA basic rule of economics is that the less something costs, the more it will be used. If carts were free or underpriced, more travelers would grab one. That would lead to a shortage, as it has for rent-stabilized apartments.\nA cart shortage would be a problem for people who overpacked or failed to buy luggage with wheels. They would rather pay $6 than struggle to find a cart.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airports, might respond to a shortage by adding carts. This would result in induced demand, just like widening a highway draws more vehicles to it. You end up with more congestion, be it vehicles on the interstate or luggage carts at baggage claim.\nThe extra carts would also add cost. Lots of \u201cfree\u201d luggage carts would not really be free.\nJay Martin of the New York Apartment Association likes to say, \u201cSomeone has to pay for the housing.\u201d The same is true for luggage carts.\nThe Port Authority, like landlords, is self-funded, not subsidized. If it bought more carts, or paid a vendor to supply \u201cfree\u201d carts, it would pass the cost on to all airport travelers \u2014 even those who don\u2019t use carts \u2014 in the form of ticket fees.\nBesides, a $6 fee for a useful item isn\u2019t \u201cextractive.\u201d What is? Forcing travelers to pay for carts that they don\u2019t use.\nIf the government subsidizes something for a select group of people, that thing should benefit society on the whole. Affordable housing does. Luggage carts, not so much.\n",

        "content": "A Hill Country town has moseyed into a race\ntypically dominated by fast-paced Dallas\n.\nFor the first time all year, a home in Fredericksburg has landed on the top 10 list of the most expensive new residential listings in the state, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nRetired banker Don Hanna and philanthropist Gwen Hanna are asking $7.5 million for their 10-acre property 6,200-square-foot home at 371 Achtzehn Road in Fredericksburg, about $1,200 per square foot. Built in 2022, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home evokes traditional Hill Country architecture, making use of local limestone for most of the home and reclaimed barn wood for the den. The 10-acre property is down the road from Boot Ranch country club and about 6 miles north of downtown Fredericksburg.\nFredericksburg, a town about 80 miles west of Austin, is a\npopular destination spot for family tourism\n, thanks to the region\u2019s quaint architecture, scenic views, thriving\nwine industry\nand country music history. Listing agent Susan Barringer with Austin-based Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty noted the property\u2019s potential as a luxury rental.\nThe most expensive luxury sales this year to date have taken place in\nDallas\n, which usually takes the top spot in HAR\u2019s monthly ranking. The priciest new listing of the month has been in Dallas seven times this year, and\nthe most expensive listing in the state\n\u2014 a 15.7-acre estate in Preston Hollow asking $64 million \u2014 is in Dallas. Houston follows close behind with a $60 million listing. Almost all lower-ranking listings are situated on the perimeter of the Texas Triangle, bound by Interstates 35, 10 and 45.\nWhile Fredericksburg rarely competes with Texas\u2019 big cities in residential luxury, it fields some heavy-hitting contenders in the ranch market. Nearby ranches for sale include the\nJL Bar Ranch, Resort &amp; Spa\n, a 4,600-property which draws between 7,000 and 10,000 guests a year, and the\n3 Creeks Ranch\n, a recreational 886-acre property asking $42.5 million.\nFredericksburg\u2019s Main Street, the town\u2019s primary tourist shopping hub, has attracted significant investment from\nDC Partners\n, which plans to develop a 22-acre mixed-use project by 2027.\n",

Last week, Metro Loft and InterVest Capital Partners scored\n$779 million\nin financing for their conversion of 111 Wall Street in the Financial District, part of the largest office-to-residential financing package in city history.\nOther prominent FiDi conversion projects in the works include a Metro Loft development at 25 Water Street, as well as projects at 55 Broad Street and One Wall Street.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A handful of prominent players in South Florida\u2019s real estate world spent 2025 in courtrooms, tangled in legal skirmishes that pitted power brokers, luxury brands and even a presidential legacy project against a cast of scorned investors, ousted owners and activist plaintiffs.\nA developer fended off anonymous smear campaigns. A builder accused investors of a hostile takeover of a project. A disgraced lawyer accused his former employers, a Miami\u00a0 Beach real estate power couple, of turning him into a scapegoat in a public corruption probe. And one of Miami\u2019s most prominent residential brokers and his wife settled a wrongful death lawsuit by the family of a college student that his wife ran over.\nHere are the 10 juiciest South Florida lawsuits reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2025:\nTrump library land deal lands in court\nThe most high-profile legal fight over South Florida real estate involved a downtown Miami parking lot adjacent to the Freedom Tower linked to the 45th and 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump.\nLocal historian and activist Dr. Marvin Dunn sued Miami Dade College in November over its board of trustees handing over the 2.6-acre site \u2014 free of charge \u2014 for a potential Trump presidential library within a nearly $1 billion mixed-use project. Dunn accused the college\u2019s trustees of violating Florida\u2019s public records and public meetings laws by quietly approving the September transfer with vague notices and little discussion.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mavel Ruiz issued a temporary injunction and set an August 2026 trial. But this month, the college held a do-over vote at a packed public hearing that was broadly advertised. The board again unanimously backed the transfer to a state board controlled by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida\u2019s four Cabinet members, all of whom have already committed to transferring the land to the nonprofit foundation raising money for the presidential library project.\nRuiz ruled the second vote cured the violations and lifted the injunction. Her decision allowed the parcel, which reportedly has a market value of $60 million-plus, to move one step closer into Trump-branded history.\nThe Centners\u2019 \u201cfall guy\u201d\nJanuary brought fresh legal trouble for David and Leila Centner, the politically connected private school operators and real estate investors. The Miami Beach couple, who own Centner Academy and have significant commercial real estate holdings in Miami, allegedly let their former lawyer and lobbyist William Riley Jr. \u201ctake the fall\u201d for bribery and money laundering charges that state prosecutors brought against him last year, a pending lawsuit alleges. The criminal charges against him were dropped.\nRiley is suing his former clients for damages over the loss of his reputation, his ability to practice law and the expenses he incurred while fighting the criminal charges since his arrest in 2023.\nRiley was accused of funnelling $245,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a Centner entity to a political committee controlled by then-Miami City Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla, who was also arrested and charged with bribery and money laundering. The affidavit contains excerpts of sworn statements by the Centners distancing themselves from the donations and the entity. The case was dropped after prosecutors determined the contributions were, in fact, legal.\nRiley claims Leila Centner directed him to open the entity\u2019s bank account, use it to buy real estate and fund political action committees. He alleges he followed her \u201cspecific and detailed instructions\u201d on contributions.\u200b His lawsuit accuses the Centners of never making an effort to clear his name.\nDe la Vegas face wrongful death suit\nIn February, One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty president Daniel de la Vega and his wife, Veronica Bilbao de la Vega, were hit with a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal crash that killed University of Miami student Daniel Bishop near Coral Gables Senior High School.\nBishop\u2019s estate, led by his parents, Susan and Jason Bishop, filed the complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The Bishops allege Bilbao de la Vega negligently turned her husband\u2019s Cadillac Escalade into a crosswalk and struck their son, who was riding an electric scooter. Bishop\u2019s family also accused Daniel de la Vega of negligent entrustment of the vehicle.\nBilbao de la Vega was charged with failure to use due care, a traffic violation, and a second degree misdemeanor of driving with an expired license, court filings show. She pleaded no contest to the charges, and she received probation in January. A Miami-Dade judge ordered her to pay the maximum fine of $1,000, plus court costs, and serve 500 hours of community service.\nThe family and the couple reached a private settlement, and the civil case was dismissed this month.\nMystery smear campaign targets Michael Stern\nAn unknown Internet hater is out to get Michael Stern. In April, Stern and his JDS Development Group sued a John Doe in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging an anonymous rival orchestrated an online smear campaign accusing Stern of fraud.\nThe operator behind JDSpulse.com and affiliated social media accounts allegedly claimed Stern has a \u201cdocumented criminal history\u201d and that his business is \u201cplagued by unethical practices, financial misconduct, and fraudulent dealings.\u201d Stern flatly denied the allegations, and is suing for unspecified damages in his defamation complaint.\nThough the website has since gone dark, the suit says the posts triggered \u201cunpleasant conversations\u201d with investors and seeks to unmask the perpetrator to recover the damages. The complaint is pending.\nElliman clashes with Eichner\u2019s Continuum\nDouglas Elliman had a hard time breaking up with developer Ian Bruce Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company.\nIn January, the brokerage sued a Continuum affiliate that took over sales for a 32-story, 198-unit condominium Eichner is building in North Bay Village.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accused Continuum of poaching agents Ruben Alvarez and Karla De La Torre after the developer fired Elliman as the exclusive brokerage for the planned Continuum Club &amp; Residences.\nContinuum breached its contract with Elliman by hiring Alvarz and De La Torre without Elliman\u2019s consent, triggering a $200,000-per-breach clawback, the lawsuit alleged. The brokerage is seeking $400,000 in damages under a marketing agreement.\nElliman and Continuum reached a private settlement that still needs a judge\u2019s signoff, a recent court filing states.\nJustin \u200bRundle versus Canero Group\nA bitter partnership fallout led investor Justin Rundle, son of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle, to fire off a legal torpedo against Canero Group principals Jose Canero Sr. and his son Jose Jr., nearly wrecking the growing development firm\u2019s project pipeline.\nRundle sued the Caneros and their firm in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in May, alleging his business partners engaged in a scheme in which they allegedly used project funds to pay their company\u2019s expenses without authorization from Rundle and other investors, while also unnecessarily delaying the projects.\nCanero Group began as a luxury home builder but expanded into multifamily and townhome development in recent years. Rundle began investing in 2023 and brought on other investors to fund six Canero Group projects, the complaint states. He sought damages in excess of $3 million.\nThe Caneros denied any wrongdoing and accused Rundle of violating Florida bar conflict of interest rules involving lawyers getting into business with clients. Rundle reached a settlement with the Caneros in October. He walked back his fraud allegations after an independent third-party accountant found no fraud or misappropriation of funds, according to a Rundle spokesperson.\nPrive Group flips the script\nUsually, investors are the ones lining up to accuse South Florida developers of bait-and-switch tactics. But a January lawsuit by Prive Group and CEO Javier Rabinovich aims to flip the antagonists in that familiar script.\nTheir lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks $20 million in damages from six Peruvian investors and their firm YVY Project Management, claiming they attempted a hostile takeover of an Aventura condo site and a Fort Lauderdale apartment project after Prive secured zoning approvals.\nPrive, known for an Aventura office condo and the Uptown Biscayne mixed-use project, also slapped lis pendens on the two development sites to block any sale while the dispute plays out.\nHowever, the case was placed on inactive status in April, court records show.\nBrickell condo in legal seige\nFed-up owners of a condo complex at 1060 Brickell voted late last year to oust board president Jacob Kassel, spawning a legal tussle that\u2019s raged since January.\nFollowing a $21 million special assessment and the elimination of electronic voting, unit owner Kimberly Spahr and fellow residents sued in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging the Kassel-led condo association improperly canceled the election on the pretext of too few candidates. The complaint alleges the board wrongly disqualified Spahr over a \u201cmonetary obligation\u201d rather than an unpaid assessment, contrary to state law.\nBacked financially and politically by roughly 180 owners, about a third of the two-tower development\u2019s ownership, the plaintiffs are asking a judge to restore the ballot box \u2014 and strip Kassel of power. The case is pending.\nSupermodel fights Fisher Island bigwigs\nSupermodel Karolina Kurkova and her husband, actor and broker Archie Drury, sued the Fisher Island Club in February, accusing it of illegal strong-arming and intimidation that forced them off one of the country\u2019s richest ZIP codes.\nThe complaint alleges the board has been operating under invalid bylaws. Two directors \u2014 Douglas Elliman chairman David Chene and fellow Elliman board member Mark Zeitchick \u2014 used their positions to steer lucrative work to their brokerage on Fisher Island\u2019s last big development site, the lawsuit claims. Kurkova and Drury, recently expelled from the club, allege the board smeared Drury, leveraged threats and bent governance rules to sideline the couple while positioning Elliman as the lead broker on remaining prime land.\nFisher Island Club dismissed the allegations as the gripes of \u201cdisgruntled former members.\u201d\nThe complaint is pending.\nPalm Beach Shores developers dragged over $4.9M\nThe courtroom battles for the developers of a troubled Palm Beach Shores project keep piling up. In January, investor Daniel Perla sued the team behind a planned three-building, 15-unit condominium complex in Palm Beach Circuit Court.\nPerla alleges developers Marc Shulman, Anthony Shafer and a web of entities stiffed him on $4.9 million in loans that were supposed to help fund the project\u2019s construction. The complaint states Perla extended two high-interest loans \u2014 a $2 million note at 15 percent in 2021 and another $2 million at 10 percent in 2022. The complaint is pending.\nAlden Global accused of a multi-million shortchange\nJoseph Miller, a longtime lieutenant to Alden Global Capital boss Randall Smith, accused his ex-employer in January of stiffing him out of millions of dollars.\nMiller sued Alden\u2019s real estate arm Twenty Lake Holdings and an affiliate of hotel developer Blue Suede Hospitality in Delaware court over what he calls a lowball buyout on a national portfolio of hotels and warehouses.\nMiller alleges he spent more than a decade growing the real estate business, earning a 10 percent stake in Twenty Lake and a 3 percent stake in two Blue Suede hotels in Miami Beach and Charlottesville. After he split with Smith and Alden Global, Miller was offered $3.5 million for his equity and $2 million for his hotel interests, which Miller alleged is \u201cnot remotely credible or appropriate.\u201d\nThe complaint pegs the book value of his Twenty Lake stake at more than $15 million based on an August valuation of 88 properties. Miller also said third-party appraisals could push his entitlement north of $26 million, setting up a high-stakes valuation fight.\n\u200b",

        "content": "A\nHolmby Hills\nmansion tied to a business management firm to the stars topped last week\u2019s additions to the local high-end inventory.\nThat\u2019s according to the weekly report compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, which counts new active listings and homes under contract in Los Angeles County. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfactors in only homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nThe resort-inspired estate at 145 North Mapleton Drive, which is listed by Compass\u2019\nGinger Glass\n, is asking $48 million. That pencils out to $3,127 per square foot.\nThe over 15,000-square-foot property sits on nearly a 1-acre lot and last traded in 2020 for $36.5 million, or $2,378 per square foot. That was when a limited liability company called Maple Living purchased the home, striking a deal on a property that first hit the market for $55 million in 2019, according to property records and listing sites.\nMaple Living is managed by Tri Star Sports &amp; Entertainment, according to records obtained through PropertyShark. The West Hollywood firm represents actors, athletes, artists and other high-net-worth clients and has reportedly been linked to stars such as Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian in the past. Earlier this year, the company acquired Miami business management firm LRW Group for an undisclosed sum.\nThe Mapleton Drive home is big on privacy with the property behind 12-foot-tall gates and a guard house with its own kitchen and bathroom. In all, the home counts seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms with a chef\u2019s kitchen, bar, pool cabanas and home theater.\nAmong last week\u2019s signed contracts was a Malibu home that claimed the No. 1 spot in the Eklund Gomes report, with a listing price of $7.5 million, or $2,707 per square foot.\nThe 1978-built beach house at 6649 Zumirez Drive, with its own private access to Little Dume, is owned by a trust tied to producers Paul Taublieb and Susan Cooper.\nThe Emmy Award winners paid $740,000 for the home in 1996. The duo is behind the documentary \u201cUnchained: The Untold Story of Freestyle Motocross\u201d and \u201cThe Vow,\u201d a movie starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Susan Monus holds the listing.\nTaublieb and Cooper initially asked just under $8 million for the home in September, before reducing the price to $7.5 million in November.\nThe home sits on an over 1-acre lot and counts three beds and three baths across 2,752 square feet.\nOverall, Los Angeles County saw five residential properties added to the for-sale inventory in the week, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, a dozen homes went into contract, which was good for $66.5 million in asking volume. That\u2019s a spike of well over 200 percent compared to the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Whether Chicago\u2019s real estate dealmakers got the rebound they wanted in 2025 depends on who you ask.\nLuxury residential brokers would say it was one of the\nbest years of their careers\n, and the city\u2019s\nbiggest brokerage\nwas officially absorbed by an even bigger one from New York.\nYet commercial developers and office landlords are still mostly on the sidelines, with only a\nselect few\ngetting back into the game.\nTrophy office towers are roaring again,\nmegaprojects stirred back to life\nand the Midwest\u2019s multifamily landlords are riding some of the\nstrongest rent growth in the nation\n\u2014 a result of dropoffs in new construction that nonetheless helped stave off lenders.\nStill, plenty of players, tenants and banks were\nrattled by distress\n, and lawsuits containing allegations of foul play and fraud flew back and forth.\nThese were Chicago\u2019s juiciest real estate stories of 2025.\nOffice market shows signs of life\nAfter years of headlines about distress and record vacancies, Chicago\u2019s office sector gained real momentum in 2025 \u2014 though only at the top end.\nThe biggest splash came at\nSalesforce Tower\n, where developers Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises landed a $610 million refinancing. That deal preceded a string of subleases, including space Salesforce rented to\nNewmark\nand private equity firm Wind Point Partners, showing trophy space still draws demand from top-tier tenants.\nThe Bank of America tower at\n110 North Wacker Drive\nsecured a $700 million refinancing led by landlord Oak Hill Advisors, marking the city\u2019s largest commercial mortgage-backed securities office loan since the pandemic. With Bank of America the largest tenant in the building and the tower offering high-end amenities, lenders showed a level of confidence that has grown rare for Chicago office buildings.\nIn Fulton Market, developers Jeff Shapack, Tim Anderson and their partner Walton Street Capital also defied Chicago\u2019s office market woes with a\n$247 million refinancing for 167 North Green Street\n.\nBut the picture wasn\u2019t uniform. Blackstone extended the\n$1.3 billion loan on Willis Tower\nfor a sixth time, as valuation swings and tenant downsizing kept pressure on the skyscraper.\nPlans for office\nconversions into residential chugged along\n. And trades within the sector that did occur extended the streak of extreme losses in value from previous sale prices.\nNew York-based investors were the big buyers:\n601W Cos. bought the building at 525 West Van Buren Street\nfor just $35 million, Mike Kohan paid just $45 million for the skyscraper at 311 South Wacker Drive to mark an 85 percent discount from its last sale, while Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management are working on a deal to snag the tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a steep loss for the seller,\nBeacon Capital Partners\n. Plus, the New York-based\nStahl Organization\npartnered with Hines to buy the Boeing Building for just $22 million.\nMeanwhile, Neil Bluhm\u2019s aforementioned\nWalton Street Capital is having a tough time\nselling its Magnificent Mile office tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue after drawing initial interest from seriously capitalized buyers.\nMegadevelopment momentum\nChicago\u2019s major development sites, some long-stalled, made real progress in 2025.\nAt\nLincoln Yards\n, new investors emerged to buy undeveloped land off the clearance rack, including\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n. They paid\n$84 million\nfor land on the north side of the Chicago River from Bank OZK, which seized the property from a venture of the original developer, Sterling Bay and its partner Lone Star Funds.\nMore recently,\nJohn Novak\nemerged as a buyer for much of the southern Lincoln Yards assemblage. The revived momentum pointed to a more phased, modular approach, replacing the bigger, $6 billion buildout originally pitched by\nSterling Bay\n.\nDespite\nsuffering some setbacks\n, Bally\u2019s pushed ahead on its\n$1.7 billion permanent casino\ncomplex in River West. Construction rose on the riverfront site, and remained on track for opening in late 2026.\nRelated Midwest and CRG bought the long-dormant\nformer U.S. Steel site on the South Side\nin partnership with\nBlue Owl\n, teeing up a multibillion-dollar quantum computing project on the lakefront as the anchor of a larger redevelopment play.\nAnd at The 78 megasite, Related and billionaire\nJoe Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC\nsecured approval to build a privately funded soccer stadium \u2014 the site\u2019s first real vertical development.\nMeanwhile, stadium plans for the\nWhite Sox\nand\nBears\nremained uncertain. The Sox were left out of stadium planning at The 78, and the Bears floated a\nmove to Indiana\nafter Illinois lawmakers ignored funding requests.\n@properties sale to Compass kicks off new consolidation wave\nChicago\u2019s\nbrokerage landscape shifted\nwhen Compass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in a $444 million deal that closed early in the year.\nThe move gave Compass a dominant foothold in the city and combined its marketing platform with @properties\u2019 agent base and mortgage and title arms. It also set off a wave of local reactions, as competitors\nrecalibrated, and agents speculated\nabout the merger\u2019s effect on the city\u2019s top firm.\nLocal legacy powerhouse\nBaird &amp; Warner bought\nthe Chicago-focused brokerage Dream Town Real Estate to bolster its scale.\nBut by year-end,\nCompass had agreed to a $1.6 billion all-stock acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate, which owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21 among other brokerage brands. If approved, the merger would give\nCompass a sprawling umbrella\nand further consolidate power at the national level, as brokerage industry norms get\nscrutinized and reconsidered\n.\nSouth Side multifamily distress\nWhile rents climbed and inventory stayed tight across Class A apartments, the South Side\u2019s multifamily sector struggled with legal, financial and reputational blows.\nIn South Shore, properties owned by\nWisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood\nwere\nraided by federal immigration agents\nfollowing a wave of tenant complaints and building code issues. The ownership group had already\nfaced foreclosures and lawsuits\ndue to subpar property conditions and loan payment defaults before the stunning law enforcement operation carried out in the middle of the night.\nNearby, legal fights broke out between\nonce-active investors\n. Chikoo Patel, who oversaw a portfolio of dozens of buildings across the South Side, was\nsued by multiple partners\n, including investor Shai Wolkowicki, who claimed Patel improperly siphoned off millions of dollars for his own use. Wolkowicki and Patel also\nfaced a foreclosure lawsuit\nfrom lender Old National Bank. Separately,\nWolkowicki also sued Mitch Goltz\nover claims of mismanagement in their prolific former retail development partnership,\nGW Properties\n.\nBack on the South Side,\nNew York-based Emerald Empire\u2019s apartment portfolio\n, which included over\n$600 million in real estate it purchased in bulk from Pangea Properties\nin 2022, slid into forbearance on a massive Fannie Mae loan.\nAcross Chicagoland,\nThe Real Deal also tracked the nearly $100 million\nthat investors who got blacklisted by Fannie Mae tossed into regional real estate.\nLakefront luxury reaches new peaks\nHigh-end housing\nsurged past previous records\nin 2025, especially along the North Shore and into Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva.\nA\nWinnetka lakefront estate\nowned by Walton Street Capital executive Jeff Quicksilver and his wife Ashley Quicksilver sold for $32.5 million \u2014 the most ever paid for a home in Illinois \u2014 just weeks after another mansion in the same wealthy power town traded for\n$31 million\n.\nThe\nQuicksilvers set another local record\nas they downsized to a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth mansion\n, and a\n$20 million Lake Geneva sale\nalso closed, reinforcing a strong year for waterfront trophy homes. North Shore specialist\nJena Radnay\nclosed both the big Winnetka deals as well as the Kenilworth sale, marking a new peak for her brokerage practice.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline homeowners. The residents who\nsued the Winnetka government\nfor overhauling rules to make it harder to develop blufftop land along the water\nsuffered a setback in court\n. Yet they\u2019re still fighting to repeal the regulations.\nLake Geneva also saw litigation. The\nhistoric Aloha Lodge\nbecame the\nsubject of a lawsuit\nafter an initial buyer walked away from a $37.5 million contract. But demand overall stayed strong, with multiple bidders vying for move-in-ready estates at about the\n$10 million range\n. Interest rate pressure didn\u2019t seem to reach this end of the market.\nProperty tax troubles plague all of Cook County\nIt\u2019s a perennial theme in Chicago real estate:\nproperty tax chaos\n.\nDelayed bills\nleft buyers in limbo\nand cost\nChicago Public Schools nearly $250,000 a day\nin interest on short-term loans it took on to cover the gap from late property tax revenue. Assessments across the\nSouth and West Sides jumped\n, with some homeowners discovering tax bills that had doubled.\nLate in the year, a federal court ruled the\ncounty\u2019s annual delinquent tax sale system unconstitutional\n, casting uncertainty over how liens would be handled moving forward.\nThe result of it all was\ndeal slowdowns\n, broken underwriting assumptions and increased tension between commercial landlords and homeowners. With no sure fix in place, tax policy remains a key concern heading into 2026.\n",

        "content": "Where Metin Negrin once saw a sales opportunity, he\u2019s instead embracing the office-to-residential conversion trend.\nLexin Capital filed plans to convert 229 West 28th Street in Chelsea from office and retail use to apartments, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. It\u2019s not immediately clear if the units will be rentals or condos.\nThe conversion plans call for the 12-story, 157,000-square-foot building to expand to a 35-story, 207,000-square-foot residential complex. Most of the space would be residential, though there would also be 3,900 square feet of commercial space; the Department of Buildings application references \u201cgeneral wiring for a nightclub\u201d on the ground floor.\nThe conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n. In comments to the Observer, Negrin said the project \u201cshows the adaptability of this great property,\u201d mentioning how it started as a printing factory a century ago.\nNegrin\u2019s excitement for the conversion is a departure from a few years ago, when the Lexin owner and president appeared ready to wash his hands of the property.\nLexin bought the property on West 28th Street, dubbed the Caxton Building, in 2014 for\n$81.5 million\nand refinanced it in 2016 with a $73 million loan from Aareal Bank. Lexin put the property up for sale in February 2020, at which time it was 90 percent leased, aiming for a price around\n$138 million\n.\nHe never sold the property, though, and leasing activity collapsed as the pandemic\u2019s impact raged across the office landscape. In 2022, Lexin reached maturity default on the property\u2019s non-performing loan, a $65 million debt an Aareal subsidiary\nput up for sale\nin 2023, when the property was only 58 percent leased.\nMonths later, a buyer emerged for the debt: Lexin itself, putting it in control of the building\u2019s future once more. That future doesn\u2019t appear to include existing office tenants, including health tech company Noom and wedding photographer Edward Dye.\nElsewhere, Lexin put the development site at 75 Nassau Street\nup for sale\nlast summer, seeking a valuation of around $75 million in either an outright sale or stake sale for one of the last 421a-eligible development sites in Manhattan.\nThe site \u2014 zoned for mixed-use residential and commercial and eligible to be developed into a rental or condo building with 253 units \u2014 has yet to be sold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Columbia Property Trust has been hit with a notice of default tied to San Francisco office buildings six months after the debt matured.\nThe New York-based firm\ndefaulted on a $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan in July and received the notice of default from its lenders on Dec. 17, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The loan was backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street in the Financial District and five other office buildings across the country.\nThe debt has since grown to $1.9 billion, according to the notice. Lenders could pursue foreclosure if Columbia doesn\u2019t rectify the situation and pay back the money owed.\nThe seven-building portfolio also includes three office buildings in Manhattan, one in Boston and one in New Jersey. Columbia\nsought to sell debt backed by 201 California\nthis summer; as of this fall, lenders were negotiating with Ridge Capital Investors to sell the debt for $75 million, but no deal has materialized.\nColumbia first defaulted on the $1.7 billion loan, originated in late 2021 by a group including\nGoldman Sachs\n, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, in January 2023, a few months before its scheduled maturity. Columbia negotiated an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July 2025, with an additional six-month extension option, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times. The firm did not exercise the extension option or pay off the loan at its maturity.\nThe seven-building portfolio was appraised at a total of almost $1.3 billion this year, down from nearly $2.3 billion in October 2021. The appraised value of 650 California dropped to $305 million this year from $479 million over the same period. Columbia bought the building in 2014 for $309 million. The 34-story tower was 87 percent occupied as of September 2024, according to the most recent CMBS data available from lenders cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Solomon was an employee at the REIT for more than a dozen years.\nHe was charged last December\nwith stealing more than $9.5 million from the company between 2009 and 2023.\nProsecutors in the U.S. Southern District\u2019s office don\u2019t appear to be buying his argument about the disclosures.\nThey responded to Solomon\u2019s motion, saying that he was trying to shift the focus of the trial away from himself and onto Vornado.\n\u201cIn essence, the defendant seeks to convert a trial about whether he committed wire fraud and aggravated identity theft into a trial about whether Victim Company-1 has complied with securities laws,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cWhether Victim Company-1 has complied with the securities laws is irrelevant to whether the defendant committed the charged offenses.\u201d\nSolomon pleaded not guilty in December and by May prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle with him to change his plea. Solomon switched attorneys, though, and\ndug in his heels\nto fight the charges.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "The Department of Veterans affairs must build more than 2,500 housing units on its West Los Angeles campus, a federal appeals court has ruled.\nLast week, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a court order requiring the VA to construct 750 temporary units for veterans within 18 months and 1,800 permanent housing units within six years, LAist\nreported\n. The VA is accused of \u201cstray[ing] from its mission\u201d by leasing land to commercial tenants like the University of California, Los Angeles, for a\nbaseball field and Brentwood School for a sports complex\nrather than using it for veterans.\n\u201cThere are now scores of unhoused veterans trying to survive in and around the greater Los Angeles area despite the acres of land deeded to the VA for their care,\u201d Judge Ana de Alba said in the Powers v. McDonough case opinion. There are more than 3,000 unhoused veterans in the Los Angeles region.\nThe appeals court backed a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge David O. Carter that found the VA discriminated against disabled veterans by failing to provide adequate housing on the 388-acre property deeded as a soldiers\u2019 home in 1888. The ruling also invalidates most commercial leases on the property, including Brentwood School\u2019s 22-acre sports complex and an oil company\u2019s drilling license, though the district court\u2019s previous invalidation of UCLA\u2019s lease for its baseball stadium was overturned.\nThe case dates back to a 2015 settlement in which the VA promised to build 1,200 housing units, with more than 770 completed by 2022. The deadline came and went without new housing, which prompted the new lawsuit. The veteran plaintiffs said the dearth of on-campus housing has kept disabled veterans from accessing physical and mental health services at the VA.\nAs of late last year, there were 307 veteran housing units open on the West L.A. campus and 461 units under construction, according to the VA.\nJeffrey Powers, the main plaintiff in the class-action suit, lived in a tent outside the\nVA Medical Center\n. Following the appeal\u2019s court\u2019s ruling, he said the decision comprises \u201cabout 80 percent\u201d of what he\u2019d like to see done.\n\u201cWe got the most important thing, which was to get veterans off the street,\u201d Powers said. \u201cAnd for that, I\u2019m happy with the outcome.\u201d\nIn May, President Donald Trump\nissued an executive order\ninstructing the VA secretary to develop a plan to\nhouse 6,000 people\nat the West Los Angeles VA center by 2028. The case is now back in the hands of the District Court judge to implement the court\u2019s housing order and oversee construction of units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s already slow development pipeline just hit another snag \u2014 this one self-inflicted.\nThe interim chair of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Zoning Committee is pulling the emergency brake, suspending meetings in an effort to force Mayor Brandon Johnson to finally appoint a permanent leader to one of the most powerful panels in city government, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. North Side Alderman Bennett Lawson, who has chaired the committee on an interim basis since August, said Monday he\u2019s done playing placeholder.\nLawson declined to schedule a January\nzoning\nmeeting, meaning no zoning items can advance to the full City Council next month. The move effectively freezes dozens of developments across the city that need final approval, according to the publication.\n\u201cIf I continue to be in the acting role, it kicks the can down the road,\u201d Lawson told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to force the issue and bring about a quick resolution.\u201d\nThe Zoning Committee is where Chicago\u2019s development battles are won or lost, overseeing rezonings, planned developments and issues that routinely touch gentrification, landmarking and design standards. Without a chair and without meetings, projects large and small are stuck in limbo \u2014 an unwelcome delay for developers already navigating high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a cautious lending market.\nThe vacancy itself is the product of months of political gridlock. Johnson\u2019s first pick for the role, former Alderman\nCarlos Ramirez-Rosa\n, resigned amid bullying allegations. The seat then sat open until September, when Johnson tapped longtime zoning powerbroker Walter Burnett Jr. Burnett, however, stepped down from the council in July, reopening the wound.\nLawson has filled the gap twice now, first for nine months after Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s exit and again after Burnett\u2019s departure. He\u2019s made clear he won\u2019t do it indefinitely, citing the workload and political weight of the job, which comes with extra staff, office space and a seat on the Planning Commission.\nJohnson insists a solution is coming. The mayor said Monday he plans to propose a broader reshuffling of committee chairmanships and downplayed concerns about delays. When pressed on timing, he offered a single word: \u201cSoon.\u201d\nBehind the scenes,\ncompeting interests\nhave slowed any resolution. Progressive and moderate blocs, along with the City Council\u2019s Black and Latino caucuses, have jockeyed for control. Johnson\u2019s attempt to install Alderman\nDaniel La Spata\nwas rebuffed. Alderman Gilbert Villegas has floated himself as an alternative. Lawson, a freshman alderman but former zoning staffer, has also said he wants the job.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In an Elmhurst neighborhood where teardowns have become the norm, a small 1920s house that dodged the wrecking ball is making its case for preservation \u2014 with a glossy, design-forward relaunch.\nA 1925 cottage on Arlington Avenue designed by architect Harold Zook has hit the market just under $1.5 million after a full-scale glow-up that leans into its storybook bones rather than erasing them. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,900-square-foot home at 231 South Arlington Avenue was listed Dec. 18 by Pattie Murray of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s, which first reported the sale. The price amounts to $517 per square foot.\nOwner Kristin Luu calls it \u201c\nZook 2.0.\u201d\nThe renovation keeps the chalet-style wood ceiling, gingerbread staircase trim and rolled eaves intact, while layering in a high-contrast color palette, eccentric light fixtures and finishes that skew decidedly 2025. Luu, an executive search consultant, worked remotely with Finnish designer Maya Mhanna via Decorilla to update both form and function, carving out a mudroom and adding a basement powder room without flattening the home\u2019s original character.\nThat balance matters in\nElmhurst\n, where older homes are\nroutinely scrapped\nfor large new construction. The Zook house sits on a one-third-acre lot that would have been catnip for builders. Its two immediate neighbors are replacement homes, and at least four nearby properties have sold to teardown buyers in recent months, according to the publication. One such sale on Illinois Street closed in July for $1.7 million \u2014 for the land alone.\nBy comparison, Luu\u2019s asking price covers both land and a fully reimagined historic house.\nThe property\u2019s prior owner, Regina Bollaert, sold the home in 2023 for $1 million after her family owned it for six decades and actively resisted selling to developers. Luu told the outlet that she wasn\u2019t initially shopping as a preservationist, but the house\u2019s intact details changed the project from a simple redesign into something closer to a rescue.\nIn at least one case, the house won the argument. Luu initially planned to open up the kitchen, then backed off, deciding the closed layout better suited the home\u2019s\nCotswold-style\nfootprint.\nZook, who left his mark across the western suburbs and designed the art deco Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge, isn\u2019t typically associated with modest cottages. That architectural provenance sets this house apart from many of the homes that have disappeared nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "L+M Development landed fresh capital for one of the city\u2019s most ambitious coastal housing plays in Queens.\nA joint venture led by the developer landed $278 million in construction financing to build the first residential phase of Arverne East, a master-planned development poised to reshape a large stretch of Far Rockaway with affordable housing, Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe deal funds Building D, a 320-unit project at 116 Beach 36th Street that kicks off a megaproject due to deliver 1,650 affordable apartments across 116 acres.\nThe sponsorship group goes well beyond L+M. Partners include Urbane Development, the Bluestone Organization, Mega Group Development and Triangle Equities Development.\nGoldman Sachs Alternatives\u2019 Urban Investment Group is the anchor lender, alongside a roster of public agencies that underscores the project\u2019s political heft.\nThe capital stack includes the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Housing Development Corporation, New York State Homes and Community Renewal, plus funding from the City Council and Queens Borough President\u2019s office.\nBuilding D will deliver 230 affordable rental units and 90 homes slated for private ownership. The mix reflects a broader push to blend rental housing with paths to ownership in neighborhoods where prices have long shut residents out.\nConstruction is expected to wrap in 2028.\nArverne East has been in the works for years, born out of post-Sandy planning to rethink development along the Rockaways\u2019 flood-prone coastline. The project leans heavily on climate-resilient design, featuring buildings elevated above flood levels and packed with mitigation measures.\nPlans for Building D include roof-mounted solar panels paired with ground-source heat pumps, bioswale gardens to manage stormwater and flood-proofed ground floors.\nFar Rockaway was among the areas hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and later, by flooding tied to Hurricane Ida. Those disasters pushed city officials and developers to pursue projects that could withstand increasingly volatile weather while still adding housing supply.\nThe financing follows an earlier milestone for Arverne East. In mid-2023, developers completed a 35-acre nature preserve and a Coastal Conservation Center on the site, bringing a community center and Parks Department space to the area.\nFuture phases are slated to add more housing, retail, a community facility and even a boutique hotel.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The fallout from the alleged fraud tied to indicted developer Ken Mattson\u2019s LeFever Mattson firm is getting closer to the embattled developers\u2019 families.\nIn a new court filing, the unsecured creditors committee representing more than 600 defrauded investors won permission to subpoena the 83-year-old mother-in-law of co-founder Tim LeFever, alleging the now-defunct California real estate firm transferred more than $2.4 million to her in the years leading up to the real estate empire\u2019s collapse, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That figure includes more than $1.6 million in the year leading up to LeFever Mattson\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nJudge Charles Novack approved the request the same day it was filed. LeFever\u2019s mother-in-law, 83-year-old Kathleen Hamlin, has now been identified as a litigation target in the ongoing case.\nHamlin lives near LeFever and his wife Amy in Dixon, California. Creditors are looking for recoverable assets \u2014 such as indicted developer\nKen Mattson\u2019s properties\n\u2014 in the case that prosecutors have described as a long-running Ponzi scheme. Mattson was\nordered to surrender the deed\nto his home in Piedmont earlier this month.\nThe subpoena seeks documents from Hamlin, her accountants, attorneys and family members, including Tim and Amy LeFever. It also targets a web of affiliated nonprofits, construction firms and limited partnerships\nconnected to the firm\u2019s\nreal estate investment vehicles, which at their peak controlled roughly 200 properties valued at about $400 million. Hamlin has until Jan. 9 to share the documents and until Jan. 30 to appear in court for oral testimony.\nProsecutors allege Mattson siphoned funds from investors into secret accounts for personal use, rather than using the money to invest in real estate on investors\u2019 behalf. LeFever has filed more than 60 claims in the bankruptcy proceedings saying he flagged accounting problems to regulators last year.\nThe committee and lawyers representing LeFever Mattson entered into mediation with Tim LeFever this month. LeFever has not been criminally charged, while Mattson has pleaded not guilty to\nnine federal counts\nincluding wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\nCourt filings suggest the defrauded investors may ultimately recover between 20 to 40 percent of what they put in. Many were retirees who gave their life savings or retirement funds to LeFever Mattson. Still, many of them haven\u2019t lost hope, and have turned to each other for support, either over text message or in person. Some have even offered their prayers for Mattson, hoping for a \u201cheart change,\u201d the Mercury News\nreported\n.\n\u201cSometimes we joke, or we talk about the pain we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d investor Stephen Crane said of his relationships with fellow victims. \u201cBut there is ultimately justice. There will be a day when he has to stand before God and acknowledge what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cKen robbed us of our money. But he can\u2019t rob our joy or our peace,\u201d Crane\u2019s wife Maria added.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Distressed multifamily investor Lurin Capital\u2019s Uptown landlord added to the\ncrush of lawsuits\nfacing the troubled company and its founder Jon Venetos.\nDallas-based Rosewood Property Company claims Venetos skipped out on a lease at the firm\u2019s signature office property, Rosewood Court.\nLurin signed a 10-year deal to lease space at the office property at 2101 Cedar Springs Road in 2018, Rosewood said in the lawsuit. The company expanded its space at the building multiple times, ultimately moving from a 1,226-square-foot space to a 6,425-square-foot office in May 2024, according to the landlord. Modifications to the agreement included extending the lease until 2035.\nTerms of the lease outlined in the lawsuit show Venetos agreed to a payment schedule that started at a rate of $46 per square foot and incrementally increased to $60 per square foot by the end of the lease.\nRosewood claims Venetos was sporadic on payments starting in July 2024, and stopped paying rent altogether in June 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October, and Lurin Capital vacated the space in November.\nAlthough the property is in Dallas\u2019 most coveted office district, Rosewood said it\u2019s been unsuccessful in filling the space. Venetos owes the landlord $5.3 million because has personally guaranteed the lease, Rosewood said. The sum includes past due rent and fees, future rent and attorney fees.\nRosewood joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords suing Jon Venetos over unpaid bills. Acore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits in the spring when it said\nVenetos defaulted on nearly $400 million\ntied to 12 properties in Florida.\nSince then,\nFannie Mae\nsued Venetos and Lurin over a $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and still\nowes $81 million\n.\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

        "content": "One of\nHouston\u2019s busiest homebuilders\nhas a new owner \u2014 and a new hometown.\nAustin-based Brohn Homes acquired the Houston division of HistoryMaker Homes, giving the Central Texas builder its long-awaited entry into the region. The deal closed Dec. 12, Brohn Chief Operating Officer Greg Barber\ntold\nthe Houston Business Journal, though the purchase price was not disclosed.\nThe transaction hands Brohn an instant footprint in Greater Houston, including a 30-person local team led by Roderick Flint and active or planned construction across 13 master-planned communities, according to the publication. Those include Sunterra in Katy, Attwater near Waller, Fulshear Lakes in Fort Bend County, Sierra Vista in Iowa Colony and Azalea in Pattison.\nHistoryMaker\nhas been a steady player in the Houston market. The Grapevine-based builder closed 247 homes locally last year and started 238 more, ranking 32nd among area builders by volume. The company entered Houston in 2016 and consistently expanded before this pull back to its core markets, according to the outlet.\nFounded in 1949,\nHistoryMaker\nwill now focus exclusively on\nDallas-Fort Worth\nand San Antonio. CEO Nelson Mitchell framed the sale as a cultural fit, saying the companies\u2019 shared values made the move a \u201cnatural alignment.\u201d\nThe acquisition is a shortcut into Texas\u2019 largest and most competitive housing market for Brohn \u2014 and one it\u2019s had its eye on for years. The builder has operated in Austin since 2003 and was acquired in 2018 by Clayton Properties Group, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary and one of the country\u2019s largest homebuilding platforms.\nBrohn only expanded to San Antonio earlier this year, but Barber told the outlet that Houston has long been part of the growth plan.\nThe deal boosts Brohn\u2019s headcount from 80 employees in\nAustin\nto about 110 across its Texas operations. Longer term, the company has set an ambitious target: Building 1,000 homes per year in the Houston area within five years.\nThat goal puts Brohn squarely in a crowded field dominated by national giants and well-capitalized regional players, all competing for lots, labor and buyers in a market that has cooled from pandemic highs but remains one of the nation\u2019s most\nresilient\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House of Representatives is fast-tracking a sweeping package of reforms that could dramatically slash residential property taxes in the state, causing heartburn for local governments that use the money to fund critical services such as law enforcement.\nLegislators are proposing seven constitutional amendments for the 2026 ballot that would give voters the chance to decide whether to scale back or eliminate property taxes on homesteaded residences, the Orlando Sentinel\nreported\n. If voters approve the changes, local governments could lose up to $18 billion in annual revenue.\nThe proposals, to be debated when the\nFlorida Legislature\nconvenes for its yearly session on Jan. 13, mark the boldest effort yet in Florida politicians\u2019 long-running battle over property taxes.\nOne of the measures would wipe out local non-school taxes on homesteads. Others would expand exemptions or create new ones tied to property insurance coverage.\nOrlando and Orange County are among the localities that warn the plans could destabilize budgets that rely on\nproperty taxes\nto fund police, fire, parks and basic infrastructure.\nHouse Speaker Daniel Perez, a Republican legislator from\nMiami\n, said lawmakers want to give voters a \u201cmenu\u201d of options rather than a single plan.\nGov. Ron DeSantis\n, who pushed for eliminating all property taxes, has opposed that approach, warning it could splinter support. But his influence is waning, as a lame-duck governor with no veto power over ballot initiatives.\nLocal officials and fiscal analysts say the proposals threaten to upend municipal finance systems that hinge on the stability of property levies.\nOrlando could lose about $72 million in annual revenue if homestead taxes vanish, while unincorporated Orange County could lose nearly $278 million. Critics argue that loss would inevitably shift the tax burden onto renters and small businesses or force cuts in essential services.\nSupporters, led by GOP legislators and state CFO Blaise Ingoglia, contend property tax growth has become \u201cunsustainable,\u201d arguing homeowners deserve relief amid surging values. Any resolutions that pass the House and Senate with three-fifths majorities will appear on a statewide ballot next year and require 60 percent voter approval.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

The developer applied using density bonus incentives and the provisions of\nAB 2011\nto build larger than zoning rules would normally allow at the site in exchange for including eight apartments set aside for very-low-income and moderate-income households.\nThe proposed development faced pushback from residents as well as members of the Planning Commission. Some residents said city staff didn\u2019t use its discretion to block or force changes to the project, and others said the project would block views of the ocean and increase traffic on the seaside highway.\nCommissioners cited a lack of sufficient parking on site as part of the reasoning for its denial of the project, the Daily Breeze\nreported\n. The officials said that spillover parking from apartment residents onto nearby streets would hinder potential beachgoers\u2019 entry to the coast below and create congestion that would block access to a nearby fire station.\nIf Redondo Seaside Living chooses to appeal the project, the issue would go before the Redondo Beach City Council.\nRedondo Beach has dealt with builder\u2019s remedy in the past and taken steps to prevent its application in the city. In 2023, city officials\nrepeatedly denied\na permit application from\nprominent Los Angeles developer Leo Pustilnikov\nto build a 35-unit mixed-use apartment complex at a\nformer power plant\nat 1021 North Harbor Drive.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Earlier this month, she listed her townhouse at 160 East 81st Street, just blocks away, for $26 million.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Welch plans to live in the home. A chief of staff for Welch said, \u201cyour information is incorrect\u201d in response to questions about the purchase, but did not elaborate.\nWelch\u2019s new purchase is the penthouse atop the 11-unit pre-war building, which was converted into condos following a 2006 renovation.\nSpanning 7,200 square feet, the five-bedroom apartment sprawls across three stories, including a top-floor landscaped terrace and home theater.\nA private elevator landing leads into a double-sized living room with 10-foot ceilings, herringbone floors and a limestone gas-burning fireplace. The first floor also features a formal dining room overlooking Park Avenue and a wood-paneled library.\nThe second floor holds two more terraces, one of which features an outdoor kitchen and dining area, a primary suite and a sauna.\nThe seller is billionaire hedge funder\nJoseph Edelman\n, who bought the apartment for $30.5 million in 2008. He initially listed it for over $33 million in 2021, but dropped the asking price several times since then. The condo had a last asking price of nearly $27 million.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche had the listing.\nFor Welch, an author and professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, the purchase is the latest in a series of property moves that have come since her husband\u2019s death in 2020.\nIn 2022, Welch sold her Lenox Hill co-op at 834 Park Avenue for\n$21 million\nafter buying it with her husband, Jack, for about $19 million in 2018.\nThat sale came roughly one year after she bought her now-listed townhouse for nearly\n$23 million\nin 2021. The double-wide home spans almost 7,700 square feet and comes with seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\nIn 2022, Welch also listed her Hudson Valley estate for\n$25 million\n.\n",

Financial terms of the deal for the six-story, 14,000-square-foot property were not disclosed.\nThe lease was revealed in a memorandum published to public records days before Christmas.

Weisman applied for rent stabilization exemptions for three floors \u201cas a courtesy to the owner.\u201d\nSutton\u2019s been making moves in Soho.

But it did not include his latest home purchase, which closed on Dec. 22.\nThe sale marks one of the priciest non-waterfront home sales in the area.\nThe real estate industry rallied around Suarez during his eight-year tenure as mayor. Suarez helped push through major projects, including the Miami Freedom Park mixed-use stadium development. He was also considered\nMiami\u2019s \u201ctech mayor\u201d\nwho helped woo major Silicon Valley investors to the Magic City.\nAmong his side gigs, Suarez was a private consultant for former developer Rishi Kapoor, who was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding more than 50 investors who contributed\n$93 million\nfor his real estate projects.\nEileen Higgins\nwas sworn in as mayor days before Suarez\u2019s home purchase closed, following a runoff election earlier this month against former city manager Emilio Gonzalez. Higgins also garnered major support from the real estate industry.\nSuarez\u2019s new home was completed in 2025. It sits on nearly an acre of land with an outdoor grill, fireplace and pool, according to the listing. The property hit the market last summer for just under $10 million.\nMichael Martinez of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the seller. Jordan Karp of Jordan Karp LLC represented the buyers.\n",

        "content": "A longtime anchor of Chicagoland\u2019s Polish-American community is poised for redevelopment, as a local builder lines up a roughly $150 million apartment project to replace the shuttered White Eagle banquet hall.\nNoah Properties plans to raze the restaurant at 6839 North Milwaukee Avenue in Niles and build a 354-unit residential complex across seven acres, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The White Eagle, which operated on the site since 1967 and hosted generations of weddings, fundraisers and visiting dignitaries, closed earlier this month.\nBart Przyjemski\n, president of Schiller Park-based Noah Properties, said demolition could begin in January, kicking off a three-phase build expected to wrap up in late 2027. Plans call for clusters of townhouses and four mid-rise buildings designed by Chicago\u2019s\nJonathan Splitt Architects\n, along with a public park, rooftop terraces and a pool.\nIn a nod to the site\u2019s legacy, Przyjemski plans to carve out about 6,000 square feet of retail space along Milwaukee Avenue for a future restaurant, though the concept and operator remain undecided.\nThe developer has zoning approvals in hand but is seeking tax-increment financing to make the numbers work. Village officials are reviewing the request, which would divert future property taxes to help cover project costs.\nAn initial analysis found the development includes \u201ca substantial amount of eligible expenses,\u201d village spokesman Mitch Johnson told the outlet, adding that the public benefits are also significant. Any TIF package would still require Village Board approval.\nPrzyjemski\nsaid the subsidy is needed to address unusually poor soil conditions tied to prior excavation for the Deep Tunnel flood control project. Foundations will have to extend roughly 26 feet deep, he told the outlet, driving up construction costs.\nDemand, however, appears strong. Noah recently completed Novu, a 180-unit rental project a few blocks north at 6633 North Milwaukee, which Przyjemski said is about 60 percent leased. Records show he bought the White Eagle property earlier this month for $5.7 million, financing the purchase with a $3.99 million loan from Genesis Capital.\nThe White Eagle, with capacity for 1,500 guests, welcomed figures ranging from Pope John Paul II to former President Jimmy Carter. Mayor George Alpogianis acknowledged the emotional weight of its closure but said redevelopment is part of the village\u2019s evolution.\nThe project is expected to draw young families and improve the\nMilwaukee Avenue\nstreetscape with landscaping, wider sidewalks and buried power lines. Traffic concerns remain, though officials said a new signal could be added.\nOne last historical question lingers: Beneath the banquet hall\u2019s exterior cladding may be a century-old facade from the Silver Leaf Tavern. The developer is required to see if it can be salvaged and displayed \u2014 a small link to the past amid a major remake.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A $1.5 billion data center campus proposed for San Marcos is back on the city\u2019s agenda after a zoning stalemate, giving\nCentral Texas\nanother shot at a high-stakes test case in the region\u2019s data center boom.\nFort Worth-based Highlander SM One and New Braunfels landowners Donald and Germaine Tuff have restarted the entitlement process for the five-building project at 904 South Francis Harris Lane, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nCity officials and the development team said the application was formally reset in October, teeing it up for its first hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission in January and the City Council in February.\nThe proposal hasn\u2019t materially changed. At full buildout, the campus would include five\ndata center\nbuildings with 76 megawatts of power capacity each, totaling a $1.5 billion investment. No job count has been released, though most employment would be tied to construction rather than permanent operations.\nThe project has drawn sustained opposition from nearby residents and skepticism from some council members, in part because it\u2019s been conflated with a separate gas-powered\ndata center\nproposed nearby in unincorporated Hays County, according to the publication. This site, however, is different \u2014 and now fully back in play after the council unanimously approved annexation of the remaining 64 acres in August.\nStill, the zoning effort collapsed last time around. Council members voted 5-2 to amend the city\u2019s comprehensive plan in TK, but the move required a six-vote supermajority after the planning commission recommended denial. Rather than triggering a formal denial and mandatory waiting period, the applicant opted to restart the process.\nOne notable shift: Dallas-based\nCyrusOne\nis no longer contractually tied to the development. The data center giant had been associated with the project and even held a community meeting, but delays caused its agreement to expire, Highlander manager John Mayberry said at a Dec. 16 meeting. He added that multiple potential operators remain interested but can\u2019t move forward without zoning in place.\nTo win approval, the developers are offering concessions. They\u2019ve proposed restrictive covenants addressing water use, drainage, impervious cover, noise and LEED standards. Cooling would rely on a closed-loop system requiring a one-time fill of up to 70,000 gallons, with daily water use of roughly 20,000 to 35,000 gallons \u2014 far less than a residential subdivision, city staff said.\nThe stakes are real for\nSan Marcos\n. City officials estimate the project could generate $9 million in property taxes for the city, $15.2 million for the school district and $5.3 million for Hays County. That revenue looms large as the city stares down a projected $13 million budget shortfall by 2029.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Walker &amp; Dunlop disclosed that it may have to repurchase millions of dollars of loans after Freddie Mac discovered borrowers committed\nmortgage fraud\n.\nThe finance and advisory firm revealed in its most recent earnings report and call with analysts that it has received requests from Freddie Mac to repurchase two loan portfolios with $100 million in unpaid balance because of fraudulent documentation submitted by the borrower.\nThe company has already entered into forbearance with Freddie Mac for one of the loan portfolios. It said it expects to enter into forbearance on the second portfolio of loans, totaling $49.3 million. But if it fails to reach an agreement, Walker &amp; Dunlop could be required to repurchase the loans.\nThe firm has hired an outside counsel to investigate suspect transactions in which borrowers may have committed fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter. As part of this process, Walker &amp; Dunlop has put some of its originators who worked on the deals on leave as it looks into the matter, sources said.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop did not return a request for comment.\nThe moves come in light of the federal government\u2019s continued investigation into commercial mortgage fraud. The Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have discovered a variety of schemes in which borrowers were able to obtain mortgages for far more than their properties were worth through inflated financials or purchase prices.\nSo far, the lender\u2019s role in these schemes has been less scrutinized than borrowers. The ease with which borrowers were able to obtain loans has raised questions about the lender\u2019s due diligence and underwriting.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop ranked as the largest Fannie Mae multifamily lender in 2024 with $7 billion in volume.\nAgency lenders such as Walker &amp; Dunlop originate loans and sell them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If a borrower commits fraud, the lender is usually responsible for covering Fannie or Freddie\u2019s legal costs or has to repurchase the loans.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop said it expects to use $20 million of its own capital as collateral to indemnify Freddie. It expects to take credit losses tied to the troubled loans in the fourth quarter, the firm\u2019s CFO said in its earnings call with analysts in November.\n\u201cWhile our portfolio performance is exceptional, and we feel extremely good about the credit quality of our book, we continue to investigate, in collaboration with the GSEs (Government Sponsored Enterprises), specific incidences of borrower fraud that took place largely as a result of changes in industry practices in the aftermath of the pandemic,\u201d said Walker and Dunlop\u2019s CFO, Greg Florkowski in the earnings call in November.\nThe firm\u2019s fraudulent loans represent a small fraction of the firm\u2019s overall business. Walker &amp; Dunlop reported a total transaction volume of $15.5 billion in the third quarter.\nWalker and Dunlop did not disclose the names of the borrowers it alleges committed fraud.\nThe firm has made at least three loans to embattled Mordechai Weiss or his wife, Basya Weiss.\nThe Monsey-based\nMordechai Weiss\nis a target of the DOJ and FHFA\u2019s\ninvestigation\n, according to sources familiar with the matter. Weiss is also the subject of a\nlawsuit\nby a lender of a Houston apartment deal over a sham deal where the lender alleges Weiss, along with his title insurer, used a fake purchase to obtain a $69 million loan.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop loans to Weiss\u2019s properties have also led to litigation and foreclosures.\nFannie Mae is seeking to foreclose on a $12 million loan for a multifamily property in Rochester, New York. (Walker &amp; Dunlop originated the loan, sold it to Fannie Mae and then repurchased it in December 2024, according to court documents).\nIn Greenbelt, Maryland, Freddie Mac initiated a foreclosure on a $35 million Walker &amp; Dunlop loan tied to Weiss\u2019s 178-unit multifamily property. Fannie Mae has also sought to foreclose on a $13.5 million Walker &amp; Dunlop loan on a rent-controlled multifamily property in\nEast Orange, New Jersey,\naccording to court documents.",

        "content": "The Lowenstein family\u2019s Lionstone Development is launching sales for a planned condo project in Palm Beach Shores that stalled out under a previous developer.\n123 Ocean is a 6-story, 27-unit luxury condominium slated for the 0.7-acre site at 123 Ocean Avenue. The Lowenstein family bought the site for $13 million last year from developer Deepak Khosa, who planned and began construction of an 18-unit condo project dubbed the\nPearl\n.\n123 Ocean is set to include floorplans spanning between one- and three-bedrooms, with prices ranging from $1.7 million to $8 million. Lionstone tapped Arquitectonica, interiors firm Asthetique and landscape design firm Naturalficial to design the project. The building\u2019s amenities will include a fitness center, spa facilities, a lounge, children\u2019s playroom, media room and conference room, according to a news release.\nConstruction is expected to finish in late 2027. Serhant\u2019s Christian Prakas and William Volpe are leading sales and marketing for the project.\nSerhant expanded\nto Florida in 2023 and has since grown its presence in Palm Beach County.\nLionstone is helmed by chairman Alfredo Lowenstein and CEO Diego Lowenstein. The Miami-based firm\u2019s other projects include\na planned redevelopment\nof Ritz-Carlton Residences, South Beach and the adjacent Sagamore Miami Beach.\nPalm Beach Shores, an enclave on Singer Island just north of the luxury real estate hub Palm Beach, has emerged as a draw for developers seeking more affordable development sites.\nJohnston Group Capital Management and JSB Capital Group bought a condo complex and marina in Palm Beach Shores for\n$58.5 million\nin 2023. The partners launched sales for the renovated 36-unit\nHavn Residences &amp; Yacht Club\nlast year.. Prices now start at $1.3 million.\u00a0Nearby, in West Palm Beach, developers are\nscrambling to buy out aging condos\non the city\u2019s waterfront after snapping up what vacant lots remained. Thousands of residential units are planned along the Flagler Drive corridor.\n",

The 571-space garage at 300 Northwest Second Street is on the market with JLL. Brightline wants to lease it back for 25 years. A brochure pitches a bullish outlook, saying profitability is expected to significantly increase, despite the company\u2019s financial strain and a recent ratings downgrade.\nFortress\n-owned Brightline, the nation\u2019s only privately owned passenger railway, lost nearly $550 million in 2024. It\u2019s also facing lawsuits, including wrongful death claims.\nOver 180 people have been killed in accidents with Brightline trains since 2017, an\ninvestigation\nby the Miami Herald and WLRN found earlier this year. A $60 million lawsuit in federal court from a train conductor claims he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from\nwitnessing fatal crashes\n. The company has never been found at fault for the accidents.\nBrightline did not respond to the outlet\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe company is also facing legal challenges from the Florida East Coast Railway regarding expansion plans for Brightline\u2019s Coastal Link regional commuter.\nBesides that,\nS&amp;P Global Ratings\nrecently slashed Brightline\u2019s debt deeper into junk territory, cutting the railroad\u2019s $2.2 billion in senior secured debt to CCC from BB- and downgrading $1.1 billion in corporate notes issued by parent Brightline East. S&amp;P said it expects a default by January 2027, citing discounted fares, slower-than-expected mode switching from cars to rail, and cash needs outpacing revenue growth.\nRidership rose 14 percent year-over-year in November to 280,136 passengers, with three all-time ridership days. Revenue on Miami-to-\nOrlando\ntrips jumped 21 percent as average fares topped $80.

        "content": "Landlords in Los Angeles will soon face stricter rent increase regulations.\nIn early February,\nnew rent control laws\nwill go into effect that limit most multifamily property landlords to hiking rent by 1 to 4 percent, down from the 3 to 8 percent limit that was in place for four decades, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe new restrictions don\u2019t apply to apartments built after 1979 when an earlier version of rent control laws first took effect. Landlords are still allowed to raise rents to market rates when new tenants move in. About 651,000 apartments, or approximately three quarters of\nLos Angeles\u2019 multifamily housing\nstock, will be subject to the new\ncaps on rent increases. Owners of older properties will be the most affected, though landlords of exempt apartments worry that the new rules will make it harder to secure tenants with their higher prices, according to the Journal.\n\u201cThe problem facing the nation and most certainly facing our state and city is affordability, and at the core of affordability is the price of housing,\u201d\nMayor Karen Bass\nsaid at a news conference last week after signing the new ordinance. \u201cThis is a step forward.\u201d\nAverage rent for a rent-controlled unit in Los Angeles is about $1,800 per month. Market-rate units typically rent for approximately $2,700.\nMultifamily developers are already shying away from building new properties within Los Angeles city limits. The\nMeasure ULA transfer tax\n, as well as years of rising interest rates, inflation and higher insurance costs, have\npushed developers to explore building\nin other Los Angeles County municipalities. \u201cIt\u2019s been death by a thousand cuts,\u201d\nDaniel Yukelson\n, CEO of landlord trade group Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, told the Journal.\nCase in point: In the first eight months of this year, the Los Angeles metropolitan area approved the construction of fewer new housing units than the Austin, Texas metro, despite having five times the population, according to census data cited by the Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Intel has had a presence at this site since the 1970s, according to the Business Times.\nIntel\u2019s Bowers Campus in total encompasses approximately 26 acres. The two proposed buildings would be on a 2.4-acre portion of the Bowers Campus. The company\u2019s main headquarters building is about a mile away at 2200 Mission College Boulevard.\nOne of the planned buildings will include manufacturing space, tools, servers and electrical and power facilities. The utility building will hold equipment for heating, cooling and power to support the manufacturing next door. The company plans to have current employees run the new facilities.\nSanta Clara officials are examining Intel\u2019s architectural review application as the proposal makes its way through the planning process. It\u2019s expected to advance at a hearing early next year before Intel receives building permits for the structures. If approved, construction would begin in the middle of next year and take about a year to complete.\nThe proposal marks the latest change to Intel\u2019s real estate holdings in Santa Clara. The corporation sold one of its industrial properties at 1501 Martin Avenue last month, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nIntel\u2019s biggest competitor, multi-trillion-dollar chipmaker Nvidia, has similarly been shaking up its real estate holdings in its hometown of Santa Clara. Last month, Nvidia\nsubmitted an architectural review\nfor a new building for its headquarters campus slated to span 692,634 square feet. It\nbought its headquarters campus\noutright last year from Preylock Holdings for $374 million and has bought office buildings.

        "content": "Hotel Daphne hasn\u2019t yet been open for a month, and its owners are already planning to make it bigger.\nThe boutique hotel that opened in the Heights earlier this month is preparing a roughly $15 million expansion that would add a two-story, 10-room wing and new amenities to the property at 347 West 20th Street, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n, citing a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.\nPlans call for 11,832 square feet of new construction, including king suites, a single-story pool bar with an adjoining terrace, event space, an event kitchen and a meeting room. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2026 and wrap up in early 2027, though state\npermit filings\nare preliminary and often change.\nThe expansion would build on the momentum of\nHotel Daphne\u2019s\nfirst phase, which opened Dec. 3 as a joint venture between Austin-based\nBunkhouse Hotels\nand Houston-based Wood Lane Partners. The five-story hotel was pitched as a \u201cneighborhood guest house\u201d meant to blend into the Heights rather than tower over it \u2014 a positioning that\u2019s increasingly common among boutique hospitality operators looking to tap into Houston\u2019s more residential submarkets.\nThe\nhotel\nfeatures an interior courtyard, a library that doubles as event space, a retail shop and an all-day restaurant called Hypsi. Design-wise, the project leans into the Heights\u2019 recycled industrial aesthetic, with painted brick, stepped parapets and steel windows. Bunkhouse handled the interiors in-house. Rooms at Hotel Daphne start at $359 per night.\nThe expansion marks a win for Wood Lane Partners, which has been trying to crack the Heights hotel market for years. An earlier plan for a smaller\nEuropean-style boutique hotel\n, Maison Robert, stalled after receiving approvals in 2019 as the pandemic upended hospitality development. Hotel Daphne finally broke ground in 2023, the same year Bunkhouse launched construction on its first Houston property, Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nSaint Augustine opened in 2024 and has since picked up a Michelin Key, marking an early win for Bunkhouse\u2019s brand of design-forward hotels in neighborhood settings.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s\nbiggest leases\nof the year rang in just shy of one million square feet of office space, with about a third of that area in and around the Domain.\nNvidia led the way in planting its flag in northwest Austin, followed by Apple, BigCommerce and Spectrum in 2025.\nCitywide vacancy ticked up slightly to 22.6 percent in the third quarter of 2025, up 0.1 percent from the same period last year, according to a market report from Colliers. The Domain fared much better than the citywide office market, with a vacancy rate of 13.3 percent, thanks to demand from tech companies.\nBut around town, tech, insurance and healthcare companies are pushing millions of square feet back onto the market in the form of subleases giving tenants bargain options while keeping pressure on landlords. There was just under 4 million square feet of sublease space available at the end of the third quarter, CBRE said. The good news is that number is declining, down 14 percent from the same period last year.\nHere are the biggest office leases of the year in Austin, using data compiled from Newmark and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nNvidia | 11515 Burnet Road | 99,370 square feet\nNvidia\nsignificantly expanded its Austin presence with a nearly 100,000-square-foot lease at the Brandywine Realty Trust-owned One Uptown at 11515 Burnet Road. The office building is part of Uptown ATX, a mixed-use development near the Domain. Brandywine is billing the $3 billion, 66-acre hub as \u201cAustin\u2019s second downtown.\u201d Nvidia currently has two smaller leases in Austin \u2014 52,000 sq ft on Lakeline Boulevard and 5,000 sq ft off MoPac Expressway \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if the new lease will consolidate these.\nOffice of the Texas Governor | 400 West 15th Avenue | 94,211 square feet\nGov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office not only renewed its lease at the 17-story downtown office building at 400 West 15th Avenue; it also set out to renovate 53,000 square feet of the Class A space with federal funds. In October, the Governor\u2019s office filed a permit for $2.6 million in renovations with federal funding at the site, according to a\nfiling\nwith the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, though a timeline for work is still unavailable. Austin-based Sixthriver Architects are providing the designs. The renewal doesn\u2019t help much with the glut of vacancies downtown, where the vacancy rate ticked up to 27.8 percent in the third quarter from 27.5 percent in the prior quarter, Colliers said.\nApple | 12365 Riata Trace Parkway B | 94,000 square feet\nApple renewed its lease of the entire building 8 at Endeavor-owned Riata Corporate Park ahead of the opening of its billion-dollar Northwest Austin campus at 6900 West Parmer Lane. The company employs nearly 10,000 people in the metro, positioning itself as one of the region\u2019s largest private employers, with the expectation that its workforce will grow all over the state, especially after CEO Tim Cook committed to a multibillion-dollar investment in U.S. manufacturing focused heavily on the Texas Triangle during a meeting at the White House in August.\nBigCommerce | 11920 Alterra Parkway | 65,000 square feet\nAustin-based BigCommerce took over space at the Domain 11 building that was offered up by Seattle-based Expedia.
