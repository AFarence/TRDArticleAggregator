        "content": "Vanderbilt University is moving forward with its plans for a graduate campus in West Palm Beach, more than a year after scoring its first approvals for the project.\nThe Nashville-based university is\npreparing to break ground on the $520 million campus\n, which will offer graduate programs in business and technology, according to a press release. It is the culmination of a years-long effort by both\nVanderbilt\nand West Palm Beach real estate heavyweights to bring the \u201cHarvard of the South\u201d to the aspiring Wall Street South. Billionaire Related Ross chairman\nSteve Ross\ncommitted $50 million to the campus in April. He\u2019s also hosted fundraisers on behalf of the school and advocated publicly for the project.\n\u201cTo pass up this opportunity would be a crime,\u201d he said at a county meeting in 2024. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that\u2019s ever grown that doesn\u2019t have great universities, great schools.\u201d\nRoss has millions of square feet of office and residential towers in the pipeline in West Palm Beach, and he\u2019s been on a mission to woo major institutions and corporations to fill them.\nCleveland Clinic\nis set to anchor his planned 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center, and he donated $50 million to for an additional 150-bed hospital Cleveland Clinic is planning at 400 and 450 South Australian Avenue, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported.\nAmong the other real estate donors for Vanderbilt\u2019s planned campus are billionaire Jeff Greene and\nFrisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell\n, an alum who committed $5 million.\nVanderbilt launched its fundraising campaign for the West Palm Beach campus last year, with a goal of $300 million. The university did not confirm the total it raised in today\u2019s announcement, but disclosed it would be launching a second phase aimed at raising $250 million.\nPalm Beach County and West Palm Beach City officials\nvoted in 2024\nto gift the university 7 acres of publicly owned land for the campus. In the same vote, county commissioners approved a development and conveyance agreement (DCA) with Vanderbilt that requires the university to spend $300 million in capital expenditures and create 4,500 construction jobs with the project. Vanderbilt must also have 200 full-time employees, 1,000 total students and a $70 million annual operating budget within five years of beginning operations.\nWest Palm Beach won\u2019t be the first satellite graduate campus for the university. It opened in New York City last year at a former Episcopal seminary in Chelsea at 440 West 21st Street.",

The company did not offer much detail, but according to records signed by the billionaire, he received a $39 million construction loan note. The lender appears to be venture capital firm Arcus Ventures, which could not be immediately reached\nAshkenazy Acquisition representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The terms of the lease were not disclosed.\nBut Saks Global is in financial trouble. The retailer is near bankruptcy,\naccording to\nmultiple reports, after it missed a debt payment of more than $100 million and days later its chief executive, Marc Metrick, resigned and was replaced by executive chairman Richard Baker.\nAshkenazy owns the former Barneys building on Wilshire Boulevard, too, which is now occupied by Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 another Saks Global brand \u2014 and the Beverly Connection, a shopping center on La Cienega Boulevard.\nAshkenazy recently extended the loan on the mall after the debt tied to it was stuck in special servicing for years due to delinquency,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nThe shopping center was reappraised in December 2024 for $193 million, compared to $260 million at issuance about a decade earlier, according to Morningstar. But last summer, a spokesperson for the company said it received another appraisal \u201cin excess of $300 million.\u201d The current debt balance is $210 million, per Morningstar.\n",

        "content": "Urban Outfitters is pulling the plug on its Gold Coast outpost, creating a rare large retail availability in one of Chicago\u2019s most supply starved, high-rent neighborhoods.\nThe Philadelphia-based clothing and home goods chain will vacate its multilevel space at 1100 North State Street this month, according to signage posted at the store and brokers at CBRE marketing the property, CoStar\nreported\n. The move comes as Urban Outfitters\u2019 lease expires, roughly a decade after the retailer made a then-bold leap north from its former Rush Street site into a pocket better known for steakhouses than soft goods.\nThe vacancy sets up a real-time stress test for top-tier urban retail, which has\noutperformed\nthe broader market since the pandemic upended shopping corridors in early 2020, according to CoStar. While stretches of the Magnificent Mile continue to work through elevated vacancy and repositioning, the Gold Coast has largely thrived, buoyed by\ndense wealth\n, tourism and a restaurant scene that never fully lost its luster.\nUrban Outfitters occupied space on the ground and lower levels of the three-story building, which it shares with Maple &amp; Ash, one of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country. The steakhouse controls part of the ground floor and the entire third floor, anchoring the property with consistent foot traffic day and night.\nCBRE is seeking a new tenant for Urban\u2019s former space, with leasing options ranging from roughly 5,000 square feet to 19,007 square feet, including the vacant second floor. The property is owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and is being marketed by CBRE brokers Danny Jacobson, Stephen Ansani and Luke Molloy. The marketing brochure from CBRE does not list any asking price.\nUrban Outfitters did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet. It\u2019s unclear whether the brand could return to the\nGold Coast\nin another format. The company still operates Chicago-area stores on North Milwaukee Avenue and at Westfield Old Orchard and Oakbrook Center. Nationally, Urban Outfitters has been experimenting with new store concepts and resale-focused\nReclectic\nstores.\nJacobson told the outlet that interest is already building, with early conversations spanning apparel, food and beverage, furniture and home d\u00e9cor. Some prospects would be new to Chicago.\nThe building sits in the\nViagra Triangle\n, a nickname locals use for the affluent wedge formed by State and Rush streets and Bellevue Place. New retail is also coming online at the base of Newberry Tower Plaza, and Convexity Properties is planning apartments on the former Barnes &amp; Noble site nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A 1970s-era office building in the heart of\nDowntown Austin\nis up for grabs.\nHouston-based Highland Resources placed 211 Seventh on the market, according to a release from JLL Capital Markets managing director Jeff Coddington. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the brokerage team, which includes Coddington, Joe Dowdle and Ryan Stevens, is marketing the 12-story building at 211 East Seventh Street.\nBuilt on roughly 0.7 acres, the 162,000-square-foot office building sits across the street from the historic Driskill Hotel and the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. It\u2019s also adjacent to Stream Realty Partners\u2019 ongoing remake of East Sixth Street, part of a broader effort to turn the once-raucous\n\u201cDirty Sixth\u201d\ncorridor into a more polished, all-day destination with restaurants and daytime foot traffic.\nJLL is pitching flexibility. A buyer could hold the building as offices, redevelop the site or pursue adaptive reuse, converting the structure to residential or hospitality. The asking price was not disclosed in JLL\u2019s marketing brochure, but the property was most recently appraised at $23.8 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nThe optionality of the building comes against a challenging office backdrop. Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate stood at 25.8 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. Still, Stevens told the outlet that some investors are positioning ahead of a projected rebound.\n\u201cWe expect the Austin\noffice capital markets\nto remain fertile ground for opportunistic, contrarian buyers positioning ahead of a 2026/2027 leasing rebound,\u201d Stevens said in an emailed statement to the publication, pointing to historically low basis levels despite elevated vacancy.\nAbout 62,000 square feet of the building at 211 Seventh is currently being marketed for lease. Based on tenant listings and signage, the building is roughly 61 percent leased, with occupants including Dealerware, ThinkOnward, Brightpearl by Sage and Suvida Healthcare. Those tenants are largely on short-term leases, Coddington said.\nThe site also carries density upside. While\nAustin\nrecently imposed a temporary 350-foot height cap downtown, developers can exceed it by participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program. According to the publication, the parcel is eligible for a floor-to-area ratio of up to 25-to-1 and sits outside\nCapitol View Corridors\n, removing another common constraint.\nThe adaptive reuse angle could also attract interested parties, as only about 1.1 percent of Austin\u2019s office inventory is considered viable for conversion, according to research from Partners. JLL\u2019s Coddington insisted the building at 211 Seventh is an exception, citing its relatively small floor plates of about 16,700 square feet and high window-to-floor ratio, features that can make residential or hotel conversions more feasible.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Italian investor and entrepreneur Gianluca Vacchi filed a lawsuit against his partner, developer Michael Stern, over his investment in a North Beach development that has not come to fruition.\nVacchi accused Stern and two companies tied to him of a \u201cdeliberated and calculated fraud\u201d in a scathing complaint filed in December, court records show. The lawsuit was temporarily stayed \u2014 in other words paused \u2014 earlier this month, but the complaint remains active.\nVacchi\u2019s GV NBV sued Stern, 6345 JV LLC and 6345 Manager LLC over a $2.5 million investment in the Casablanca property, an oceanfront condo-hotel at 6345 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach.\nThe two\npartnered in 2024\n, forming a joint venture to invest in a $4 billion pipeline of new developments.\nVacchi joined Stern on\nMercedes-Benz Places Miami\n, the Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded 888 Brickell and the 1250 West Avenue project in Miami Beach. But construction at Mercedes-Benz has moved slowly. At 1250 West Avenue, developer David Martin of Miami-based Terra joined Stern\nto take the lead\non the project last year.\nVacchi also partnered with Stern, Anatomy Fitness owner Chris Paciello and Rafi Gibly on Sunset Padel, an indoor padel members\u2019 only club that operates in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour.\nVacchi is part of the wealthy Vacchi family based in Italy. He sold his stake in their IMA Group, a manufacturing empire, in 2023.\nReuters\nreported that year that the private equity firm BC Partners agreed to sell its stake in IMA to BDT &amp; MSD Partners in a deal valuing the company at about 7 billion euros. A year ago, Vacchi was sued by a project consultant based in Naples, Florida, over allegedly\nunpaid fees tied to evaluations\nof the Stern-Vacchi developments.\nVacchi\u2019s attorney, Jason Giller, declined to comment on the lawsuit involving Stern. Stern also declined to comment.\n\u201cSystematic\u201d fraud\nVacchi alleges that Stern\u2019s actions were evidence of \u201cyet another scam conjured up by Stern.\u201d\nVacchi alleges that Stern schemed him into investing $2 million into a planned redevelopment of the Casablanca, in May or June of 2024, through \u201cbrazen misrepresentations, fabricated or improperly modified documents, and concealment of material facts,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe first $2 million investment was promised as a \u201cquick flip\u201d and a \u201cno lose\u201d proposition, according to the lawsuit.\nStern provided Vacchi\u2019s entity with what Stern allegedly claimed was a third-party valuation on the Casablanca land \u2014 valuing the site between $210 million and $276 million. Vacchi\u2019s company would become a member of Stern\u2019s LLC as part of the agreement. Vacchi pulled the trigger on the additional half a million dollars the following year. The valuation was actually created by JDS\u2019 development director, the lawsuit alleges.\nStern allegedly represented that it would cost $150 million to buy out Casablanca, according to the lawsuit, which would have allowed for a big windfall had he purchased and then flipped the property at the valuation price.\nStern has refused to give Vacchi a membership certificate that shows his investment in 6345 JV LLC. Instead, Stern claims that GV Development Group, not GV NBV LLC, invested in the Stern entity. That dilutes his stake in the project and his overall investment to nearly $2.2 million, the complaint alleges.\nIt\u2019s unknown how Stern and Vacchi will move forward, especially if the lawsuit continues. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Vacchi\u2019s investments are being bought out by an institutional investor.\nVacchi\u2019s lawsuit cites information from JDSPulse.com, a website that\nStern sued\nthe anonymous operator of last year over allegedly defamatory statements. That complaint, filed last year, claims the unknown website owner orchestrated a smear campaign about Stern and his company. Stern is suing to uncover the identity of the person behind the site.\nVacchi\u2019s complaint also alleges that Stern hid an \u201cextensive history of defrauding his investors\u00a0 forcing them to pursue legal actions like this one just to get their money back.\u201d The complaint dives into previous lawsuits that Stern has been involved in.\n\u201cTo make matters worse, Stern also hid that he had a long history of artificially prolonging those legal battles through abusive and deceptive litigation tactics, which any reasonable investor like GV NBV would have wanted to know when deciding whether to invest with Stern or any entity that he controls,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres is bucking the Loop\u2019s office downsizing narrative, inking a larger lease and consolidating its downtown space in a riverfront tower on LaSalle Street.\nThe fast-growing Chicago law firm signed a lease for about 40,000 square feet on the fifth floor of the building at 222 North LaSalle Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move will allow the firm to expand from the roughly 25,000 square feet it currently leases across two offices at the buildings at\n180 North LaSalle Street\nand\n191 North Wacker Drive\n, both of which it plans to vacate.\nThe deal stands out amid record high downtown office vacancy and a steady drumbeat of companies shedding space, as hybrid work settles in. While some large law firms have leaned into that trend, Croke Fairchild is moving in the opposite direction, joining a small but notable group of legal practices that have recently\ntaken bigger offices\n. According to the outlet, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago-based Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum have also expanded their downtown spaces over the past year.\nCroke Fairchild embraced remote work early, using flexibility as a recruiting tool and widening its talent pool, said managing partner and co-founder Drew Beres. But rapid growth changed the math on needed office space. The firm added 25 attorneys last year, bringing its headcount to about 110, and is increasingly running into space constraints when lawyers and staff choose to be in the office at the same time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed as we\u2019ve given people that freedom and flexibility, it seems like people want to come to the office even more,\u201d Beres told the outlet. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we accommodated that.\u201d\nThe 27-story, roughly 1 million-square-foot building at the southwest corner of LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive is owned by the Chicago-based Crown family and was already 93 percent leased before the deal, according to CoStar data. A spokesperson for the\nHenry Crown\nholding company did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s departure from the building at 180 North LaSalle will be felt more sharply. The 38-story tower, owned by Montreal-based La Caisse, is about 64 percent leased, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent, CoStar data shows, but the building at 180 North LaSalle sits across from the James R. Thompson Center, which Google is redeveloping into its Chicago headquarters, a nearby catalyst that could eventually lift demand.\nFilling space remains challenging: The Loop finished 2025 with a net loss of about 370,000 square feet of tenants compared with 2024, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 real estate trade group is beefing up its lobbying team, bringing in former government staffers to lead a push for housing reforms in Springfield and in Chicago.\nIllinois Realtors said on Monday that it was adding Melia Carter as vice president of governmental affairs. Anne Emerseon and Audrey Harding are joining as local government affairs directors to work with the\nChicago City Council\nand Cook County Board of Commissioners, respectively.\nJeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors, told\nThe Real Deal\nthe group is preparing to push for policies that increase density in Chicago and statewide, while opposing potential\nproperty tax hikes\nand tenant protections it argues would stifle investment.\nThe organization will work on \u201csecuring policies that increase housing inventory, incentivize homebuying and thwart burdensome property tax hikes and regulations,\u201d Baker said in a press release.\nCarter will manage Illinois Realtors\u2019 12-member government affairs team, according to the release. Most recently, she led Verizon\u2019s government affairs team across the Midwest and in Chicago.\nOn the local front, the association is bringing in insiders with deep ties to local governments to lead its lobbying efforts. Emerson, who will be focusing on Chicago, was chief of staff for the City Council\u2019s Finance Committee from 2019 to 2023, according to her LinkedIn. She most recently was senior vice president at Mercury Public Affairs.\nHarding, responsible for Cook County, is coming from a post as senior legislative assistant in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s intergovernmental affairs office. She has previously worked for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, first in Johnson\u2019s office and later for Commissioner Tara Stamps, according to her LinkedIn.\nThe 2026 agenda\nAt the state level,\nIllinois Realtors is backing five bills Baker called the \u201cHousing Stability &amp; Affordability Initiative.\u201d\nTwo of those bills aim to ease local zoning rules and allow for denser housing, Baker said. One would require cities to allow accessory dwelling units, a measure Chicago officials\nenacted in a limited form last year\n. Another would require larger cities to allow \u201cmiddle housing,\u201d including buildings with up to four units and townhomes, on lots of a certain size zoned for any residential use.\nOther pieces of their state-level platform include a cap on impact fees on new developments, and tax advantages for first-time homebuyers. The group is also pushing a bill that would eliminate \u201ccrime-free\u201d housing ordinances, which landlords and advocates have argued are used to discriminate against tenants based on race.\nIn Chicago, the organization will advocate for upzoning, especially near transit stations and on large lots, Baker said.\nIt will also continue opposing efforts to give tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their buildings, a measure that gained some traction last year and is in effect in some neighborhoods. Real estate groups say the policy makes it more difficult for landlords to sell their property and drives up housing costs.\n\u201cRealtors will also continue to be the largest advocate for property rights, whether that is from even more dramatic real estate taxes or restrictions on rentals that end up hurting tenants or driving homeownership further out of reach,\u201d he said.\nThe City Council passed an ordinance giving tenants in the\nSouth Shore and Woodlawn\nneighborhoods the right of first refusal to buy their buildings last year. Similar measures are in place in some\nNorthwest Side neighborhoods\nlike Logan Square and Avondale.\nBeyond the statehouse and city hall, the association plans to launch \u201chousing supply accelerators\u201d in 2026, Baker said. The program will target specific communities to study local zoning codes and recommend changes to bring down construction costs.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s ultra-luxury neighborhoods saw home prices rise to\nnever-before-seen numbers\nlast year.\nPrices in the San Francisco Association of Realtors\u2019 District 7,\ncomprising\nthe neighborhoods of Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights,\nthe Marina and Cow Hollow\n, hit their\nhighest-ever levels\nlast year, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a new\nreport\nfrom Compass.\nThe median sales price for houses in the district rose to $6 million in 2025, up 20 percent from the year prior. That marked the fastest increase among any part of the city recorded by Compass data. Across the city, the median house price was approximately $1.7 million last year.\nThe\nBay Area luxury housing\nsector at large saw an upswing last year as middle-income families have been shut out of the market due to economic uncertainty, high housing prices and less-than-deal mortgage rates, opening the door for wealthier households benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. In San Francisco specifically, the influx of\nAI workers and executives has driven up demand\nfor upscale homes so much that it has created a\nmansion shortage\nin the city. Bay Area tech workers and investors are likely also doing well from massive gains in the stock market, according to analysts.\n\u201cRight now, the economy is more favorable to wealthy people,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, told the Chronicle. That trend isn\u2019t expected to change in 2026, as this year is expected to bring San Francisco\u2019s hottest housing market since pre-pandemic times, Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle said.\nMost of the other Realtor districts in San Francisco haven\u2019t climbed back up to price peaks seen mid-pandemic when interest rates were at historic lows. Prices in the city, including the seventh Realtor district, fell in 2022 and 2023 as mortgage rate hikes poured cold water on a previously red-hot market.\nSince then, well-positioned buyers began shopping in Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, often without the need for a loan to buy a house. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping how many buyers we have coming to us who are all-cash, ready to go,\u201d Michelle Harris, a real estate agent with Compass, said. Homes selling for between $2.5 million and $5 million are being bought in a week or less, Harris said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dana Johnson,\none of Houston\u2019s top-ranked agents\n, left\nCompass\nfor Douglas Elliman this month.\nJohnson, whose deals last year included one of\nthe most expensive homes sold in Houston\n, joined Douglas Elliman after six years with Compass, citing Compass\u2019 growth as a reason for her departure.\n\u201cSometimes bigger isn\u2019t always better. I feel like at Douglas Elliman, the brand itself is a luxury brand, and that\u2019s what I sell,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCompass definitely is a luxury brand, but it\u2019s also really large. So you\u2019re not going to get the support that you need, or that I needed, in a broker.\u201d\nHouston has a narrower luxury market than other Texas metros, Johnson pointed out. That might explain why Houston enjoyed the fastest selling homes in Texas last year; Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio all had higher median days on market in the fall, according to\nRedfin\n. When\nAustin had one of the slowest markets in the country\nin October, with a median 104 days on market for luxury homes, Houston had a median of 52 days on market. Dallas and Fort Worth luxury homes both sold after a median 62 days on market, and San Antonio had a median of 91 days on the market.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have very much inventory. You can\u2019t be real choosy,\u201d Johnson said of luxury buyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small niche of where they\u2019re going to be, if they\u2019re going to buy a luxury house in Houston.\u201d\nFive of the city\u2019s top 10 luxury deals last year took place within one square mile in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Three of the others were in Memorial Villages.\nHowever, Houston\u2019s luxury market isn\u2019t just geographically tight. It also fields an exceptionally small league of agents compared to\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n\u2014 and Compass leads the group. In Dallas, 18 agents represented the 20 parties in the top 10 deals of 2025. In Austin, another 18 agents also represented the 20 parties in the top 10 sales. In Houston, just 10 agents were spread over the top 10 deals, according to\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s research.\nJohnson represented the buyer of the city\u2019s seventh-\nmost expensive residential sale last year\n, a 10,799-square-foot custom mansion at 11321 Green Vale Drive that was asking $9.8 million. Excluding Johnson\u2019s deal, eight of the top 10 residential sales in Harris County last year involved a Compass agent, usually either Laura Sweeney or Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes.\n\u201cWhen I joined Compass, there [were] a hundred agents. Now [there are] 800. It\u2019s just hard to get the support that you need when there\u2019s that many agents,\u201d Johnson said.\n",

        "content": "Trammell Crow is gearing up for another expansion at one of North Texas\u2019 biggest industrial hubs, filing plans for a new phase of its sprawling 35 Eagle development in far north Fort Worth.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow submitted filings for a fourth phase of the project at 2501 Eagle Parkway, near AllianceTexas, according to records with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the plans call for three new speculative industrial buildings totaling nearly 750,000 square feet, with individual structures sized at roughly 500,000 square feet, 107,000 square feet and 140,000 square feet. The filings peg construction costs at about $40 million.\nIf the plans move forward as filed, construction would begin in February and wrap up in April 2027. Alliance Architects is listed as the design firm. A\nTrammell Crow\nspokesperson declined to provide additional details, noting only that a formal announcement could come later.\nThe expansion would build on the scale Trammell Crow and its partner,\nPGIM Real Estate\n, have already achieved at\n35 Eagle\n. The industrial park spans nearly 5.9 million square feet along I-35 West, near the Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport and the BNSF Intermodal Center, according to Trammell Crow\u2019s website. The most recent phase included five buildings totaling about 2.1 million square feet, with the developer signaling it would pursue additional phases once that space stabilized.\nRecent activity suggests demand remains. In June, Taiwanese technology manufacturer\nWistron\nbought a 324,598-square-foot building within 35 Eagle from Trammell Crow as part of a broader North Texas push tied to its planned $750 million supercomputer manufacturing investment with Nvidia.\nFar north Fort Worth currently has the largest industrial construction pipeline in the U.S., with about 7.7 million square feet under development across 20 projects, according to CoStar.\nBeyond 35 Eagle, Trammell Crow remains active across the region, with projects underway near DFW International Airport, expansions at Passport Park and the Lake Vista Technology Park in Lewisville.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The final days of the Adams administration were busy. Here\u2019s a change that slipped under the radar.\nUnderstandably, the flurry of mayoral\nvetoes\nalongside last-minute\ndrama\non the Rent Guidelines Board garnered a lot of attention at the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 time in office.\nBut the administration also made some changes to environmental review, potentially making it a little easier for certain housing projects to move forward.\nAs part of updates to the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) Technical Manual last month, the administration permitted certain housing projects to complete a shorter Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), which typically takes six to eight months.\nThis change builds on the Green Fast Track\nadopted\nby the administration in 2024. Under that program, housing projects with fewer than 175 units in low-density districts or 250 units in medium- or high-density districts could avoid environmental review.\nBut projects with site-specific issues (such as those relating to air quality, coastal flooding, noise or hazardous materials) couldn\u2019t qualify. The changes last month allow projects that meet the density threshold under the Green Fast Track, but can\u2019t qualify due to site-specific issues, to complete a shorter EAS.\nThe city\u2019s ability to address environmental review-related delays is limited. More extensive changes require state action. State lawmakers have previously proposed exempting large affordable housing projects from environmental review, which passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nBut major change could be on the way. As part of her State of the State address, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to propose exempting a majority of housing projects from state environmental review,\nthe Wall Street Journal reports\n. She also wants to set a two-year maximum for projects that must undergo review.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What other housing-related policies will Hochul prioritize in her State of the State address on Tuesday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing you\u2019ve learned\n: Nonprofit New Destiny Housing is calling on the state to allocate $62.1 million to New York\u2019s supportive housing program in this year\u2019s budget. Last year\u2019s budget included a $17.8 million increase (40 percent) in funding for the New York State Supportive Housing Program, representing the largest investment in 40 years. In a statement, the nonprofit indicated that the governor needs to build on this investment in this year\u2019s budget.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, have moved into Gracie Mansion,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Roughly 15,000 nurses walked out of city hospitals on Monday after their union, the New York State Nurses Association, and several major hospital systems failed to reach an agreement over staffing levels, benefits and other issues,\nAssociated Press reports\n. The hospitals remain open and have hired temporary nurses during the strike.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Monday named Rafael Espinal, who formerly served on the City Council and the state Assembly, as the new commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$24.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 3,700 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nConnor Cuccinelli and Noble Black have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor 63 Crosby Street. The Soho landmark building is 32,400 square feet. Office investment company Vertex purchased the five-story building,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $13.9 million for 25 East 94th Street. The Upper East Side townhouse is 8,200 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Doyle Team has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 21,386-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 651 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford Stuyvesant. S. Wieder Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Newsday managed to publish an\nentire article\nabout the conversion of the JFK Hilton into affordable housing without naming the developers, Slate Property Group and RiseBoro Community Partnership.\nYou might ask, What\u2019s the big deal? But think about it. Would a daily newspaper run a story about a New York basketball team winning a playoff series without mentioning the Knicks?\nFor better or worse, it\u2019s pretty common for mainstream publications to cover development without paying much or any attention to the developers. If they are included at all, it\u2019s usually near the end of the piece.\nIn this case, Newsday gave full credit to the Hochul administration for the conversion of the hotel into apartments. Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s own\npress release\nat least cited the developers, but not until the sixth paragraph.\nFrom reading it, you\u2019d think she converted the hotel herself.\n\u201cGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced completion of Baisley Pond Park Residences, a 318-unit, $167 million affordable housing development in South Jamaica, Queens,\u201d it began.\n\u201cBy transforming a long-vacant hotel into hundreds of affordable homes,\u201d Hochul said in the second paragraph, \u201cwe\u2019re delivering real results for low-income and formerly homeless New Yorkers while making smarter use of existing buildings.\u201d\nThe project did get 29 percent of its funding \u2014 $48 million \u2014 from the state\u2019s HONDA fund, which Hochul helped to create. But, reality check: This is a private project by for-profit and nonprofit developers. It is not a state project.\nBefore we even give Hochul 29 percent of the credit, consider that HONDA, which stands for the\nHousing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act\n, has proven very difficult for projects to use, as\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a much more\ninformative story\nabout the Slate/RiseBoro project.\nTo be clear, I am not criticizing the governor. Her press office got her good publicity, which is what a press office is supposed to do. It also brought attention to a worthy project that might not have happened without the HONDA legislation.\nNor have I ever heard a developer complain about not being mentioned prominently in coverage by a general interest publication. Usually they are happy to stay under the media\u2019s radar because they are accustomed to being hammered.\nWhatever project they propose is criticized as:\nfor people who are too rich (billionaires! gentrifiers!) or too poor (homeless people! crime!)\nhaving too many bedrooms (children will flood local schools!) or not enough bedrooms (families need housing!)\ntoo far from the subway (traffic! parking!) or too close to the subway (crowded platforms and trains!)\nToo profitable (pure greed!) or too risky (that will never work \u2014 you should abandon it!)\nSlate and RiseBoro probably chuckled at being omitted from Newsday\u2019s piece but were surely glad to yield the spotlight to the governor. They know politicians\u2019 currency is praise and publicity. Developers\u2019 currency is permits and profits.\n",

        "content": "Dallas investor and conservationist J. Luther King added 5,000 more acres in the\nHill Country\nto his family\u2019s expansive holdings.\nThe King family acquired a 5,067-acre tract in McCulloch County dubbed the San Saba River Ranch, marking the first change in family ownership for the property since 1898. The centerpiece of the property is a mile-long stretch of the San Saba, which flows year-round. A dam on the property creates a 6-acre reservoir. Two other tributaries of the San Saba River also cross the property, which is about an hour from San Angelo.\nThe seller cleared much of the underbrush from the land, leaving scenic hardwoods and encouraging game population growth. The property also includes a four-bedroom, four-bathroom stone house and a skeet shooting range, according to the listing.\nThe sale price hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but the property was listed for $22.8 million, or $4,500 per acre. The Haynes Team with Triangle Realty co-listed the property with Dullnig Ranch Sales.\nWhile the market for land is subject to the same\nlull affecting Texas luxury homes\nafter the hot streak of 2021 and 2022,\nlive water\nand optimal game conditions continue to generate demand, according to Dullnig Ranch Sales owner Robert Dullnig.\n\u201c\nProximity to metropolitan areas\ndrives a lot of it, so when you get into some areas that are over two hours away, and you don\u2019t have the live water or the big whitetail, those properties are probably taking a little longer to sell,\u201d Dullnig said.\nKing founded Luther King Capital Management Corporation, a Dallas-based investment advisory firm. He and his family own more than 100,000 acres across six Texas counties, including the 4K Livermore in the Davis Mountains and the 4K Brady Creek Ranch.\nThe Kings are about 200,000 acres away from the\ntop 10 list of the largest landowners in Texas\n. The list is topped by the Texas Pacific Land Corporation, the legacy company of the Texas and Pacific Railway. The list ends with commodities broker Mike Smith, who owns 323,000 acres.\n",

The chef\u2019s kitchen connects to a mud room that leads to an enclosed back patio and side garden with fruit, vegetable and herb beds with automatic irrigation.\nThe third-floor primary suite features a seating area, walk-in closet and skylit bathroom with a marble double vanity, soaking tub and custom sauna.\nCompass\u2019 Laura Rozos had the listing.\nThe homes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $3 million, spent an average of 131 days on the market and had an average discount of 2 percent.\n",

        "content": "Days after the Summit Properties\nwon a bankruptcy auction\nfor 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group, the city has filed a formal objection to the sale.\nLawyers for Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s office asked a judge to stop the transaction, raising questions about insider dealing and saying that Summit has failed to show the ability to fix up the properties. It\u2019s\nthe second time\nthe Mamdani administration has objected to the bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe objection is a last-ditch attempt by the Mamdani administration to throw its might behind tenants at the Pinnacle properties. A confirmation hearing for the sale is scheduled for Thursday.\n\u201cOur north stars in these proceedings have always been improving the habitability of the buildings in this portfolio and protecting their rent-stabilized status,\u201d said Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor for housing, in a statement. \u201cAny sale of the Pinnacle portfolio, whether to Summit Gold, Inc. or another bidder, must lead to improved conditions for tenants.\u201d\nThe city argued in its objection that the sale deserves higher scrutiny because of the possibility of insider involvement. That appears to be an oblique reference to a Bisnow report last week that revealed\nJonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle head Joel Wiener\n, signed several deeds for properties that Summit claims to own. A declaration from the state attorney general\u2019s office supporting the city\u2019s effort detailed the connections between Summit and Jonathan Wiener. Summit has denied that Jonathan Wiener had any involvement in the sale.\nThe city previously said it has yet to see evidence that Summit has the\nwillingness and ability to fix housing code violations at the properties\n, arguing in court that the legal rents in the units were too low for Summit to both fix the units and profit from the sale.\nThe objection also referenced housing code violations at Summit\u2019s existing properties, which a declaration by the attorney general\u2019s office places around 4,000 open violations in a current portfolio of 3,000 units.\n\u201cThe City submits that Summit must demonstrate that it has the resources, and moreover, the willingness and intent to cure the violations within the time period required by law and, if necessary, rehabilitate the Properties, while remaining financially sustainable,\u201d the objection reads.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the city should be given time to come up with another buyer who would take better care of the buildings, or is at least owed a deeper explanation from Summit about its management plan.\nA spokesperson for Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the objection but the company has said it intends to invest in the portfolio, maintain affordability and hire new management firms.\n\u201cSummit has sufficient resources and capital to honor and perform all obligations under the existing resident leases and comply with all regulatory obligations,\u201d it said in a statement to the court. \u201cSummit also is committed to a long-term housing investment and maintaining the quality and affordability of apartments in its portfolio of Pinnacle properties.\u201d\nThe city also objected to the auction before it took place, hoping for a 30-day delay. But the judge\nthrew out that effort\nlast week.\n",

        "content": "Matthew Whitman Lazenby, whose family has owned Bal Harbour Shops since its inception 61 years ago, is in a dog fight with estranged wife, Kristin Lazenby.\nMatthew\nis trying to block Kristin from gaining access to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, and he\u2019s seeking a court order to remove a foster dog she adopted from their home in Asheville, North Carolina. Those are the latest salvos in the couple\u2019s bitter divorce proceedings that began more than a year ago, court records show.\nKristin wants bank statements, canceled checks and general ledgers for Whitman Family Development, the entity that owns Bal Harbour Shops at 9700 Collins Avenue. She wants Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in the luxury mall to be considered a marital asset.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Bal Harbour Shops have been thrust into the Lazenbys\u2019 divorce proceedings which were intended to be a private matter,\u201d Matthew\u2019s attorney Kathyrn Hamilton said in an email statement. \u201cMr. Lazenby\u2019s personal involvement in this multi-generational family business predates their marriage.\u201d\nKristin\u2019s lawyer Paul Leinoff did not respond to requests for comment.\nBal Harbour Shops traces its origins to the late developer\nStanley Whitman\n, who in 1957 acquired a former World War II army barracks site in the village of Bal Harbour. He created an open-air shopping center featuring designer brands in a tropical garden setting, opening Bal Harbour Shops in 1965. Whitman, who died in 2017, was Matthew\u2019s grandfather.\nBal Harbour Shops features landscaped, breezy walkways lined with retailers such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bvlgari, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ferragamo and Prada, as well as department stores Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.\nWhitman Family Development is renovating and expanding Bal Harbour Shops by 200,000 square feet, securing a\n$550 million\nloan in 2019 for the project. The mall owner landed a\n$740 million\nrefinancing in 2024.\nTussle over Bal Harbour Shops data\nMatthew is Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 CEO and the operating general partner for Whitman Family Development, whose chairman is Randall Whitman, Matthew\u2019s uncle. Matthew joined the family business in 2003 and rose to his current position a decade later, according to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 website.\nHe married Kristin in 2009, and they have three children, court records show. She filed for divorce on in July 2024, alleging the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d\nShe is seeking alimony, attorney fees and an equitable distribution of marital assets, which includes three homes, in Bal Harbour, Santa Rosa Beach and Asheville, where she lives with the three kids, her divorce petition states.\nThe couple has duked it out in court motions in recent months. At an October hearing over her demands to see Whitman Family Development\u2019s books, Philip Schecter, a forensic accountant hired by Kristin\u2019s legal team, testified that he needs to know if Matthew is signing a majority of the checks and payments for\nWhitman Family Development\nto determine if Matthew has an \u201cactive participation in the entity.\u201d\nKristin contends in her filings that Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in Whitman Family Development could be considered a marital asset. Schecter explained that if Matthew is \u201csigning hundreds of checks over a 12-year period\u201d for Whitman Family Development that would show he\u2019s the chief decision maker, as well as determine whether Matthew has paid himself any profit disbursements from the company.\nLeinoff, Kristin\u2019s attorney, told Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Christine Bandin, who is presiding over the case, that Matthew acquired his general partnership interest during the marriage.\nLeinoff said during the hearing that he needed the information to identify what the marital interest is and what the value is, prior to conducting depositions.\nHamilton, Matthew\u2019s attorney, pushed back. She noted Whitman Family Development was formed by Stanley Whitman and his brothers, and that Kristin had not provided proof that \u201cmarital funds\u201d were used to acquire an interest in the company.\nFoster dog caught in the fray\nAs Matthew tangles with Kristin over Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, he is also seeking to kick out a recent pet addition to their Asheville household. According to a motion filed the same day as the October hearing, Matthew claimed Kristin \u201cunilaterally fostered [a dog] on a temporary basis without the husband\u2019s knowledge or consent, and the wife had the audacity to \u2018double down\u2019 and has now informed the Husband that she has adopted the dog.\u201d\nMatthew alleges the dog killed Lewey and Dewey, the family\u2019s pet birds, and destroyed furniture and personal property inside the Asheville property. His estranged wife also allegedly let the foster and their two other dogs have free rein in the house.\nMatthew lives in Florida 51 percent of the year, splitting his time between the couple\u2019s homes in Bal Harbour and Santa Rosa Beach, according to court filings.\n\u201cThe most recent catastrophe caused by the wife has resulted in the expensive Ipe hardwood flooring in the mudroom being destroyed,\u201d the motion alleges. \u201cThis happened because the wife deliberately left the dog door closed, thereby preventing the family dogs from going outside to go potty.\u201d\nWhen Matthew returned home, he found \u201ca minefield of dried-up excrement everywhere, including all over the floors, the walls, and the doors,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe wife undoubtedly left this mess to sink into the flooring overnight because she did not want to bother cleaning it, requiring the husband to spend over an hour to clean it up himself.\u201d\nMatthew wants a court order to boot the foster dog or to give Matthew sole, exclusive use of the Asheville house. In a response filed in November, Kristin accused Matthew of violating a May 2025 agreement to settle some of their temporary conflicts, including allowing both of them to stay in the Asheville house. During a deposition, Matthew confirmed that he\u2019s \u201cnow seeking the wife\u2019s removal from her home,\u201d Kristin\u2019s motion states.\nA hearing on the dog and the house is set for April.",

        "content": "In 2025, Dallas\u2019 office market planted seeds. Industry experts intend to watch them grow this year.\nThe office market is finding its footing in the post-pandemic new normal, logging positive annual absorption of office space for the first time since 2019, according to JLL\u2019s fourth quarter report. Last year wrapped up with 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption \u2014 a marked improvement from 2024 when the market saw its first quarter of positive absorption in the fourth quarter, but still ended the year with nearly 1.5 million square feet of negative absorption.\nNormalizing conditions have two trends to thank. First, return to work mandates from major employers like AT&amp;T, Toyota and JP Morgan gave the market a boost. Second, the development pipeline shrank, reaching its lowest level since 2012.\nFor better or for worse, part of the market\u2019s new normal is its stubborn vacancy rate. The market may be settling in, but it\u2019s still carrying around a lot of dead weight. At the end of the fourth quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s vacancy rate was 27.2 percent, a slight tick up from the same period of the year before when vacancy was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nOffice trades return\nDallas\u2019 sales volume has bounced back, in another example of office market normalization. Buyers returned to the market in 2025, and the year was robust for office trades, which reached levels not seen since 2022.\nIn 2024, almost all of the\nmarket\u2019s largest office trades\nwere scattered around the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. The list included distress buys and office/industrial flex properties.\nLast year, investors got excited about Y\u2019all Street and opened their wallets for Uptown trophies. Cousins Properties kicked off the Uptown spree in July with its\npurchase of The Link at Uptown\nfor $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot.\nCrescent Real Estate topped that trade in September when it picked up\nTexas Capital Center,\nat 2000 McKinney Street. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price, but said in a release that the sale represented \u201ca significant value increase.\u201d The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016.\nExperts predict 2026 will build on these wins: \u201cCapital is back and ready to be deployed,\u201d JLL wrote.\nElephant in the room\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows for the Dallas office market heading into the new year.\nA blemish on the market, the\nsorry state of Downtown Dallas\n, is starting to look more like a wound.\nAT&amp;T dropped a bomb\non the\nstruggling urban core\nwhen it announced last week that it plans to leave its 2 million-square-foot downtown office space for a new 54-acre campus in Plano.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s chunk of the office market makes up almost 6 percent of the submarket\u2019s total space, and its upcoming exit \u2014 which could happen as soon as 2028 \u2014 is sure to push the area\u2019s elevated vacancy rate even higher. The central business district has a vacancy rate of about 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nThe submarket suffered another blow when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd announced\nhe\u2019s handing back the keys to The National\n, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refinancing in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in 2020.\n",

        "content": "The trendy Meatpacking District is ushering in more major real estate deals from players both old and new to the neighborhood.\nGlobal alternative asset manager TPG Angelo Gordon and Bobby Cayre\u2019s Aurora Capital Associates teamed up to buy 410 West 13th Street for $71 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal for the five-story, 80,000-square-foot building breaks down to $888 per square foot.\nBritish real estate firm Epic sold the property, which is also known as 15 Little West 12th Street. The company purchased the property for $69 million in 2011, suggesting there was not much profit to be had for the boutique office and retail building, which was developed by Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital Management.\nTenants include Red Bull, energy company Kimmeridge and the Match Group, parent company of dating services Tinder and Hinge. The estimated rent for office space at the property ranges from $82 to $100 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nTPG and Aurora did not respond to requests for comment on the deal.\nAurora is already one of the largest owners in the neighborhood, ranking up there with William Gottlieb Real Estate. This may be TPG\u2019s first foray into the Meatpacking District, though.\nBobby Cayre founded Aurora in 2001, focused on \u201chigh street\u201d retail. It has since expanded out into developing ground-up boutique office and retail projects, as well as the occasional residential. In August, the company made news when Aurora snagged a signed contract for a penthouse at 140 Jane Street\nasking $87.5 million\n.\nTPG just made a massive deal of its own to start the year,\nbuying a majority stake\nin Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm, Quarterra. TPG Real Estate plans to invest $1 billion in the business and could raise additional capital for growth; Quarterra has built 43,000 apartments across the country since 2011 and has another 13,000 in the pipeline.\nElsewhere in the Meatpacking District, Bilt recently\nsigned a 58,000-square-foot lease\nto take over Samsung\u2019s former office at 837 Washington Street.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

GO is remaining the majority owner of the assets being partially acquired by Rechler.\nNewmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Adam Doneger arranged the stake sale.\nTight supply in the rental market is keeping prices elevated for tenants.

        "content": "Real estate plays a major role in this year\u2019s Florida legislative session.\nLawmakers will take up proposals this session that would streamline approvals for rural master-planned communities, tweak the controversial Live Local Act, and target homeowners associations. Also up for votes are numerous proposals for property tax alleviation for homeowners who receive a homestead exemption.\nThe session starts today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tap for real estate:\nLive Local tweaks\nSen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, proposed an expansion of the Live Local Act, a workforce housing law that\u2019s riled some counties and municipalities since it was approved in 2023.\nLive Local allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations and public meetings if they designate 40 percent of the units in their projects for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThey can obtain approvals administratively and build up to the tallest height permitted within a mile and the highest density allowed in a jurisdiction. It also grants developers property tax exemptions.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the legislation with a flurry of applications, while some municipalities have decried the Live Local Act for curtailing their say over development. The law has been especially\ncontentious\nin the tri-county region\u2019s\nsmall coastal communities\nthat have maintained strict development regulations and\nfought back large projects\n.\nCalatayud\u2019s\nSenate Bill 1548\nwould expand Live Local to include properties owned by counties, municipalities and schools districts, and it would curb localities\u2019 ability to restrict height via setbacks and stepbacks. The proposal would clarify that farms and farm operations aren\u2019t commercial properties and don\u2019t qualify for Live Local projects.\nAffordability\nLegislators also want to extend the affordability requirement under the Live Local Act.\nUnder the law, the below-market units have to remain as such for at least 30 years.\nHouse Bill 675\n/\nSenate Bill 756\naim to increase this to 50 years.\nIt would also tighten the affordability requirements for developers to get tax abatements. The law allows landlords to obtain a 75 percent property tax break for all units designated for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI. The bills would drop the upper thresholds to 100 percent of the AMI.\nPost-hurricane rebuilding\nLast year, the legislature approved SB 180, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d part of which banned local governments from imposing comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations and site plan approval procedures that could be deemed \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome.\u201d The law applies to counties and municipalities included in federal disaster declarations within 100 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track.\nIt\u2019s meant to remove roadblocks to rebuilding after three hurricanes hit the state in 2024, imposing the restrictions through 2027. For all future hurricanes, the law restricts tighter development regulations for a year.\nBut the controversial proposal riled some local governments that argued it further erodes \u201chome rule\u201d authority over development regulations and potentially opens the door to developers invoking SB 180 over any local zoning change that stands in the way of proposed projects. Several South Florida municipalities joined as plaintiffs in a\nlawsuit\nlast year against SB 180, including Bal Harbour, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead and Palm Beach.\nSen. Nick DiCeglie, a Republican from St. Petersburg, filed\nSenate Bill 840\n, partly curbing the previous legislation.\nThis proposal would hand more control back to counties and cities over development rules, rolling back previously imposed limits.\nIt would roll back the temporary ban on local regulations tied to 2024\u2019s hurricanes until this year. For future storms, it would limit the one-year ban on zoning changes to damaged properties only.\nIt also would narrow the scope of SB 180 to cities and municipalities within 50 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track, while allowing localities to enforce a reconstruction moratorium if it\u2019s to address stormwater, flood management and potable water supply, or sewer repairs.\nRural homebuilding\nLandowners of at least 10,000 acres could bypass county and municipal zoning and other regulations under\nSenate Bill 354\n/\nHouse Bill 299\n, as long as they meet certain development conditions, including the creation of affordable housing.\nCreating \u201cBlue Ribbon Projects,\u201d the proposals add to initiatives that stirred controversy over their potential erosion of local governments\u2019 say over growth and development, and concerns over suburban sprawl.\nUnder the proposals, 60 percent of the land must be reserved for environmental conservation, wildlife corridors, agriculture or other open spaces, and the rest can be developed with up to 12 units per acre. At least 20 percent of residential units must be affordable, workforce housing, or homes for people who qualify under the Florida Hometown Hero Program, including teachers and police.\nQualifying projects can be approved administratively, allowing them to bypass public hearings.\nRep. Lauren Melo, a Naples Republican, and Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican representing Ocala, sponsored the bills.\nNew York-based investment manager Ruane Cunniff, which has amassed roughly 80,000 acres in north Florida counties since 2017, is backing the bills through an affiliate, including hiring lobbyists pushing for the legislation, independent investigative journalist Jason Garcia\nreported\n. Ruane Cunniff has paid at least $230 million for land in rural areas.\nTax breaks\nAfter Gov. Ron DeSantis floated the idea last year of eliminating property taxes for homesteaded residences, lawmakers put forth\noptions\nto achieve it this session.\nThe move would require\nconstitutional amendments\nand approval from Florida voters in November.\nThe resolutions would exempt property taxes funding school districts and mandate that county and municipal budgets for law enforcement should not be reduced.\nHouse joint resolution 201\n, filed by Republican Rep. Monique Miller of\u00a0 Palm Bay, would eliminate all non-school property taxes for homes. Miller\u2019s\njoint resolution 203\nproposes to increase the value of homestead exemptions by $100,000 each year for 10 years starting in 2027, phasing out property taxes by 2037.\nHJR 205\n, filed by Republican Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, would eliminate property taxes for homeowners who are 65 and older.\nRep. DeFuniak Springs, a Republican representing a portion of the Panhandle, filed\nHJR 207\n, proposing to add homestead exemptions for 25 percent of the home\u2019s assessed value after all other exemptions are applied.\nLocal governments, including Orlando and Orange County, have warned the proposals could hit\nbudgets\nfor parks, infrastructure maintenance and improvements, fire departments and other services.\nHOAs\nPorras is going after homeowners associations this session.\nResidents living in HOAs across the state have accused some board members of wrongdoing including election interference, misappropriation of funds, unjustified assessment increases, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case was at the\nHammocks\nin West Kendall, South Florida\u2019s largest HOA on 3,800 acres and with 18,000 residents.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, proposed legislation that would allow residents to disband their HOAs. But attorneys say it\nwon\u2019t work\n.\nUnder\nHouse Bill 657\n, residents could start the dismantling process with a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners, which the board must vote on at a meeting and also set the termination rules, requiring approval by two-thirds of homeowners. The plan of termination would be filed in court, and a termination trustee, such as the board or someone appointed, would oversee the dismantling of the HOA, including the sale of assets.\nExperts in HOA law said this would be difficult, because HOAs own infrastructure such as stormwater and sewer systems, landscaping and roads, and not just sellable assets such as maintenance equipment.\n\u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets?\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cWho is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nCounties and municipalities would be reluctant to assume responsibility for this infrastructure partly because it could mean increasing taxes to maintain common areas that only HOA residents use, attorneys said.\nHB 657 has other provisions, some of which attorneys hailed. It would create a Community Association Court, alleviating the backlog of HOA and condo association cases at circuit courts.",

        "content": "Investor\nAlon Abady\nhas made his latest real estate play, this time in the form of a 300,000-square-foot\noffice campus\ndonation to West Coast Chabad.\nThe 16-story office building in Pico-Robertson, with a 1,200-vehicle parking facility, sits on an acre and a half at 9911 West Pico Boulevard and was recently appraised for $103 million, according to Abady. He and his wife Monique made the donation in honor of Alon\u2019s mother, Liora Abady.\n\u201cWhen we moved to the States in the late 70s, we had nothing,\u201d said Alon, whose mother found a job with Chabad after the family immigrated to Los Angeles. \u201cThey were there for us when we first came here and that carried a personal weight.\u201d\nAbady, who is managing partner of Waterfall Bridge Capital, paid Blackstone $35 million, or about $140 per square foot, for the property in 2023 with plans to redevelop it. That could still happen with the property holding by-right entitlements, which holds the door open for a possible residential conversion.\nHowever, plans in the near future call for the building to serve as the Chabad Campus for Jewish Life, which will encompass a synagogue, educational facilities, mental and social services, a banquet and events hall and the Abady Family Center once fully operational.\nAbady described the building as \u201cspecial\u201d and an \u201ciconic LA property,\u201d sitting between Culver City and Beverly Hills. Fox Studios is located next door, while Hillcrest Country Club sits opposite the property. In a sea of mostly low-rise commercial or multifamily structures, 9911 Pico Boulevard can be seen driving from the east or west.\nAbady\u2019s latest deal, which closed on Friday, is different from some of the other trades tied to his name within the local marketplace.\nThe investor is best known for his $96 million purchase of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, but his name is also known in high-end residential real estate.\nThat portfolio includes the 2020, $25 million purchase of\nSimon Cowell\n\u2019s former home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, which Abady flipped for $34 million three years later. Also in 2023, Abady sold a property in the gated Madison Club community of La Quinta to Justin and Hailey Bieber for $16.6 million. More recently, in 2024, he paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way, which was previously owned by conservationists\nDan and Susan Gottlieb\n.\n",

        "content": "A newly built home in\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Hill Section neighborhood found a buyer last week to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s top residential property to go into contract.\nBuilt in the trendy modern farmhouse style, the six-bed, eight-bath home of more than 6,000 square feet was asking $8.8 million, or $1,424 per square foot.\nThe property appeared in the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which ranks signed contracts based on asking price. Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team compiles the weekly report, which uses Multiple Listing Service data and an asking price floor of $4 million.\nIf the deal on 711 North Dianthus Street closes, the buyer will walk away with a discount from the original ask of $9.3 million, when the home first hit the market in March.\nProperty records show an entity called BM Investments scooped up the home in 2022 for $2.6 million, with state filings tying the limited liability company to real estate investor Bedros Najarian and the Hawthorne address of a company called Doon Builders.\nThe listing is held by Thompson Team Real Estate\u2019s Joseph Nuzzolo.\nThe property\u2019s location in the Hill Section places it in the same neighborhood as Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\n.\nAlthough, the home Don\u010di\u0107 paid for last August amounted to $25 million for what was previously tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s former pad. That off-market closing edged past the $24.5 million sale of\n1800 The Strand\nas Manhattan Beach\u2019s priciest residential sale on record.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest listing to fall into contract, according to the Eklund Gomes report, was 2311 Worthing Lane, located in the Bel Air Crest community.\nDesigned as an East Coast traditional-style home, the property is listed for just under $8 million, or $864 per square foot.\nIt counts five beds and 7 baths across 9,200 square feet, with the listing held by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter.\nThe home first hit the market in September asking nearly $9 million before seeing a price reduction the following month.\nProperty records and listing sites show the home last sold in 2011 for $3.2 million and is currently owned by a trust tied to Brian and Mira Lee. Brian is a serial entrepreneur, who co-founded LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Honest Co.\nAcross Los Angeles County, signed contract activity last week shook out to be about on par with the year-ago period.

But Steven Roth was able to hold onto the building.\nVornado is free of\nspecial servicing\nat the Plaza District office building after fulfilling its obligations on the $800 million mortgage backing the property, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The loan is considered current and ownership prefunded shortfalls for the next 12 months, as well as a $1.5 million leasing reserve, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics.\nNo modification was made to the mortgage, which matures in three years. Ownership also dodged a workout fee from the special servicer.\nIt\u2019s an abrupt improvement of fortunes for an ownership group that also includes Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, none of whom commented on the latest development.\nThe debt behind the Class A office building was sent to special servicing in October after the borrower failed to meet payment obligations. A month later, a Piper Sandler analyst predicted the building\u2019s lenders would soon take possession of the property and work on a quick sale.\nOwnership secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy quickly fell off.\nOccupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued, but Ralph Lauren \u2014 which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building \u2014\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\npaying\nabout 30 percent less in rent.\nOccupancy dropped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is all the way back up to 98 percent, per CoStar. Office tenants include Lakewood Capital, while retail space is occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property saw its value fall; once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nThe 28-story office and retail building totals 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by Vornado, Oxford and the pension fund in 2013 for roughly $1.3 billion.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-gestating South Side Chicago megadevelopment spearheaded by leadership of the Apostolic Church of God is moving closer to reality, with its first phase set to face city zoning and planning officials this month.\nDeveloper J. Byron Brazier, son of longtime Apostolic Church pastor Byron Brazier, applied for a zoning change for the initial phase of Woodlawn Central, an 8-acre, church-controlled \u201ccultural\u201d complex planned along the 63rd Street corridor, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The application would amend a planned development designation originally approved for the site two decades ago.\nThe\nfirst phase\ntargets an Apostolic Church parking lot bounded by 63rd and 64th streets, Dorchester Avenue and the Metra Electric tracks. Plans call for two buildings rising from a block-long podium, with a 14-story, roughly 160-foot-tall structure with 231 apartments units, a hotel, 23,000 square feet of retail and another 3,500 square feet of commercial space.\nThe\nbase\nwould house retail and residential and hotel lobbies on the ground floor, with parking decks on the second and third floors. The buildings above would hold the apartments and hotel rooms. The project would include 300 parking spaces for cars and 260 bicycle spots, a notable ratio for a transit-adjacent site near the 63rd Street Metra station.\nAs required under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, 20 percent of the units would be set aside for households earning up to 60 percent of area median income, which equates to $71,940 for a family of four. Brazier framed the project as an economic development play as much as a housing one, emphasizing jobs, workforce pipelines and income growth as tools to attract market-rate investment without displacement.\nIf introduced as planned at the Jan. 21 Chicago City Council meeting, the proposal would still need approval from the plan commission, the zoning committee and the full council.\nWoodlawn Central\nwas first unveiled in 2021 as a sweeping, multiyear vision for church-owned parcels nearby. At full buildout, the project is expected to include about 870 housing units across workforce, market-rate, luxury and senior categories, along with roughly 215,000 square feet of office and retail space. Later phases include a performance venue, a district-scale energy facility, a vertical greenhouse and renovations to the historic headhouse at the 63rd Street Metra Electric station.\nThe zoning push lands amid a broader development wave in Woodlawn tied to the Obama Presidential Center, slated to open in June. City Council last fall approved a separate\n26-story hotel\na few blocks east at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue, backed by Aquinnah Investment Trust, led by Allison Davis, a onetime boss of Barack Obama.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Investors burned in a nearly $120 million Bay Area real estate fraud scheme\nmay not recover\nall their losses through condominium unit sales by a receiver at 1853 Almaden Road in San Jose and 42111 Osgood Road in Fremont, the Mercury News reported.\nThe case is tied to South Bay real estate executive\nSanjeev Acharya\nand his company\nSilicon Sage Builders\n. In 2020, federal investigators charged Acharya with defrauding hundreds of investors out of $119 million that they had invested in an unknown number of projects by Acharya and Silicon Sage across the Bay Area. Authorities claimed Acharya and Silicon Sage, like fellow\nembattled Bay Area developer Ken Mattson\n, would shift money around from investors to various bank accounts to keep cash flows active. Silicon Sage and Acharya had 77 different bank accounts in total and made at least 130,000 banking transactions over a period of eight years.\nAcharya was caught when authorities homed in on the activities of seven entities that Acharya and his company controlled. \u201cThe transactions that the receiver\u2019s forensic accountant analyzed consistently demonstrated that money put into a specific entity would be transferred through multiple accounts, usually within a matter of minutes, before ending up in the account of an entity that needed to make payments that day,\u201d the receiver said in a U.S. District Court filing on Dec. 3. He settled his case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission in 2021.\nA court-appointed receiver hired Acres Loan Origination, the senior construction lender for the 96-unit Almaden Road complex in\nSan Jose\nand the 91-unit Osgood Road development in Fremont, to complete the projects. The money earned from these condo unit sales was supposed to go to investors and other creditors who lost money in Acharya\u2019s web of alleged fraud, but the effort soon hit a snag.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the cost to complete the projects exceeded the original estimates and took longer than anticipated,\u201d Kyra Andrassy, a legal counsel for the receiver, said in legal documents. The attorney cited \u201ceconomic repercussions of the pandemic and supply chain issues,\u201d in addition to the failure of Acharya and Silicon Sage Builders as professional developers, as hurdles that proved difficult to overcome.\n\u201cMuch of the work that had been completed prior to the receiver\u2019s appointment needed to be redone or repaired because of shoddy workmanship,\u201d the receiver told the court.\nThe Osgood development in Fremont was completed in early 2024 and had sold all of its units by June of that year. Acres received $62.7 million from the sale of the condos in that building. In San Jose, the Almaden project was completed in late 2024, but sales have been slower than anticipated. As of early last month, 45 condos had been sold, while another 12 were in escrow and the other 39 were still available for sale. Acres has received $28.8 million in proceeds from that project so far.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul wants to make it easier to build in New York, while also cracking down on bad landlords and cutting down on property owner costs.\nIn her fifth State of the State address, Hochul will unveil her \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, which includes speeding up housing and infrastructure projects. She will also back\nefforts\nto create new criminal charges for landlords that repeatedly harass tenants across their portfolios.\nHochul\u2019s agenda echoes the\nearly approach\nof Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who has simultaneously taken steps aimed at easing housing construction while also ramping up enforcement actions against landlords. Her policy priorities in the book, however, do not include increasing taxes on corporations or the state\u2019s wealthiest individuals \u2014\u00a0proposals key to paying for some of the mayor\u2019s top campaign promises.\nSpeeding up the building process\nAs part of \u201cLet Them Build,\u201d the governor pitches exempting certain housing projects from the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA, according to the\nState of the State book\n, which lays out the governor\u2019s policy priorities for the year.\nThe governor calls for allowing housing projects that have no significant impact on the environment and are compliant with local zoning to avoid environmental review. Projects must be outside flood risk areas to qualify and still need to abide by state rules related to water use, air quality, environmental justice and protection of natural resources.\nThe book doesn\u2019t get into specifics, but notes that the state will establish different density caps for projects eligible in New York City, based on neighborhood density. Elsewhere in the state, projects can only qualify if located on \u201cpreviously disturbed\u201d land and connected to existing water and sewer systems.\nUnder Hochul\u2019s proposal, certain green and other infrastructure projects, including nature-based storm water management, public parks and recreational bike/pedestrian paths, could avoid review.\nThe governor also wants to cap the review process at two years and to clarify the timeline for waging a legal challenge to these reviews. She additionally is calling on state agencies that review and approve permits to assess their processes and find ways to speed up approvals. Agencies must issue recommendations by Sept. 1.\nHochul similarly\nproposed\ncarveouts for small housing projects, those spanning no more than 10,000 square feet, as part of her State of the State last year.\nThis year\u2019s more ambitious proposal comes after California successfully\nexempted\ninfill housing from its state environmental review process.\nEnvironmental review can add years to a project\u2019s timeline. New York City has tinkered with the city version of environmental review, allowing some housing projects to either\nskip review\nor undergo a\nshortened one\n. The state rules, however, set minimum requirements for localities to follow, meaning that significant change requires action by state.\nSen. Rachel May previously proposed legislation that would exempt much larger affordable housing projects, those consisting of up to 1,000 units, from environmental review. The measure passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nThe policy book notes that an analysis by the city and state of 1,000 projects found that \u201cvirtually none of such projects ultimately were found to have significant environmental impacts.\u201d\nOther multifamily moves\nHochul also supports legislation that would upgrade felony charges against landlords who systematically harass rent-regulated tenants across multiple buildings or are \u201crepeat serious offenders.\u201d At the urging of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Sen. Brian Kavanaugh and Assembly member Micah Lasher introduced similar\nlegislation\nlast year.\nThe governor\u2019s policy priorities include some initiatives aimed at decreasing costs of multifamily property owners, but do not include changes that would allow for increasing rents on vacant stabilized apartments, as landlord groups have sought.\nHochul proposes reforming the property tax break J-51, which expires in June. The City Council\nrevived\nthe incentive in 2024, more than a year after the state\napproved\na new version of the tax break that limited the pool of eligible buildings. The abatement is provided to owners who renovate their stabilized apartment buildings, which must be at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or otherwise receiving \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nOwners have previously blamed outdated price schedules \u2014\u00a0which are used to determine the value of the break \u2014\u00a0for making the program unappealing. The most recent iteration of the abatement creates too narrow a universe of eligible buildings, according to landlord groups.\nThe State of the State book cites \u201cadministrative challenges\u201d as a reason that owners haven\u2019t sought the incentive, but doesn\u2019t provide details on a new program.\nThe governor doesn\u2019t mention property tax reform, nor alternative property insurance models, which are frequently floated as possible cost-cutting initiatives for owners. The State of the State book, however, proposes expanding insurance discounts for homeowners and multifamily owners, and also ramping up reporting requirements for insurance providers.\nThe governor is also seeking to increase income eligibility for Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE), programs that provide tax credits to landlords in exchange for freezing rents for certain senior and disabled tenants.\nHochul wants to allocate $250 million to \u201caccelerate affordable housing\u201d this year, adding to her $25 billion, five-year housing plan announced in 2022. The State of the State book doesn\u2019t mention funding for the state-based housing voucher program\napproved\nlast year.\nTuesday\u2019s address comes as Hochul faces a challenge on the left from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman on the right in her re-election campaign. Some socialist lawmakers, including state Sen. Jabari Brisport and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, have endorsed Delgado.\nThe election already seems to be shaping the governor\u2019s policy agenda this year. In an answer to Mamdani\u2019s pledge for free childcare, Hochul\nannounced\na $4.5 million plan this month to expand free and low-cost childcare across the state. She also proposed eliminating state income taxes on up to $25,000 of tipped income, following a federal rule\npromoted\nby President Donald Trump.\n",

        "content": "Wellington narrowly approved zoning changes that would allow former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and Mike Meldman\u2019s Discovery Land Company to transform a polo field into a mixed-use project with homes, an equestrian complex and private club.\nOn Monday, the village council voted 3 to 2 on first reading to move the Isla Carroll Polo and Residences development forward.\nMayor Michael Napoloeone cautioned that the plans need extensive changes if the developers hope to secure approval for second and final reading in February \u2014 despite assurances that the development\u2019s polo field would be used by the United States Polo Association.\n\u201cIn the interest of preserving the [polo] field I am giving you another shot, but I don\u2019t know how you are going to get there unless there are fundamental changes,\u201d said Napoleone, who voted yes along with Vice Mayor Tanya Siskin and Councilman John McGovern. Councilwoman Maria S. Antuna and Councilwoman Amanda Silvestri voted no.\nNew York-based McCourt Partners and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Discover Land Company want to redevelop the 79.2-acre former East Isla Caroll at 3665 120th Avenue South in polo-centric Wellington into a development that would include an equestrian complex with a polo field and a private club with a polo observation deck, restaurants, a spa, racquet sports, gym, and polo training simulators.\nThe rezoning portion of the developers\u2019 request centered on being able to build 40 single-family homes on lots averaging a half acre. Under the property\u2019s present zoning, those 40 houses must be built on lots that are two acres each, large enough for an owner to construct a home with a horse stable, in keeping with Wellington\u2019s equestrian preservation zone.\nMcCourt, who said he traveled from Cairo, Egypt to speak at the meeting, told council members that he wanted to make sure his development benefited the sport of polo. He did not want it to become \u201canother soulless subdivision.\u201d\n\u201cWe have gone to great lengths to comply with your code and not ask for a single thing we are not entitled to,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cThis is a project we\u2019re extremely proud of and we have a lot of people supporting it.\u201d\nMcCourt\u2019s attorney Neil Schiller said the project has 120 letters of support and the backing of Wellington\u2019s planning staff. Among those speaking in favor was Stewart Armstrong, chairman of the USPA, who confirmed the organization has an agreement to lease the property for $1 a year, as well as the $250,000 a year cost of maintaining the field, at 10-year increments for up to 45 years.\n\u201cThat is like FAU [Florida Atlantic University] having a deal with the NFL to have games and programming at their stadium [in Boca Raton],\u201d Schiller said.\nThe USPA won\u2019t have to travel far since the neighboring National Polo Center is already used by the professional polo association. Schiller argued that not having a polo-oriented private club would be a missed opportunity. Discovery Land Company partner Ed Davitas said that the development, designed by New York-Buenos Aires architecture firm Estudio Ramos, would center around learning and watching polo.\nCritics of the project countered that the 24-stall barn would be demolished, only one of the site\u2019s two polo fields would be preserved, and that there were no facilities for horses to stay overnight on site. They also feared that the project could go the way of 23 other polo fields in Wellington and end up being replaced with more residential development should the arrangement between the developers and USPA fall apart. Schiller countered that a covenant would require that any further land use changes would have to be unanimously backed by the council if this deal is approved.\nMcGovern told Schiller that if this vote was for final approval, he would have voted against. He hopes McCourt and Discovery come back with a plan that\u2019s more than just a \u201cpolo field and a country club.\u201d\nOne way to do that was to craft a site plan where there were \u201cfive farms plus homes,\u201d McGovern added.\nA company tied to McCourt paid $52 million for East Isla Carroll in 2022, about a decade after McCourt sold the Dodgers baseball team for $2.2 billion.\nThis wasn\u2019t McCourt\u2019s first transaction in Wellington. He sold a 5.2-acre equestrian property at 13808 Fairlane Court for nearly\n$12 million\nin 2016 and a 9-acre equestrian property for $12 million in Mallet Hill that was a short walk away from Microsoft\nfounder Bill Gates\u2019 assemblage\n. (Gates\u2019 daughter, Jennifer Gates, is an equestrian.)\nDiscover Land Company, a luxury community developer, teamed up with Becker Holding Company to build Atlantic Fields, a 1,500-acre development in\nHobe Sound\nin Martin County with 317 single-family homes and a golf course.\n",

        "content": "Falling mortgage rates will drive activity in the housing market in the coming year, the National Association of Realtors\u2019 top economist said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the Chicago Association of Realtors\u2019 2026 Market Outlook conference, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said\nlower rates\nwill bring more buyers into the market, while the stagnated inventory in Chicagoland will start to loosen up as homeowners\u2019 life circumstances change.\nDays after national brokerage\nCompass closed its bid to buy\nAnywhere Real Estate, its next-biggest competitor, presenters at the conference made no mention of the effect consolidation may have on the industry, or the fight over private listings brewing between\nCompass and Chicago\u2019s local MLS, MRED\n.\nInstead, the conference focused on the macro trends that will drive the housing market over the next year. The 30-year mortgage rate fell below 6 percent this month for the first time since 2023, sparking confidence that consumers will jump into the housing market.\n\u201cAfter three years of seeing 7 percent mortgage rate, 6 percent or even 5.9 percent mortgage rate appears much, much better,\u201d Yun said. \u201cThe consumers\u2019 mindset may be, yeah, this is the time to get into the market.\u201d\nNationally, that will inject some needed juice into a housing market that was essentially flat in 2025, according to NAR\u2019s estimates. Yun said he expects existing home sales to rise by 14 percent nationwide in 2026. NAR does not have forecasts for Chicago specifically, but a December Illinois Realtors study predicted a 5.1 percent increase in\nhome sales in the Chicago metro area\nin 2026.\nChicago\u2019s home prices have risen significantly in recent years, but a combination of high interest rates and low inventory have meant sales volume is down compared to pre-pandemic levels. But those pressures may ease throughout 2026, Yun said.\n\u201cYou are beginning to see more inventory coming onto the market, because even though (homeowners) were sincere to say they love their 3 percent mortgage rates, some have experienced major life-changing events,\u201d Yun said, like having children or retiring. \u201cSo with the passage of time, expect more inventory.\u201d\nThe economy is sending mixed signals, Yun said, but he dismissed concerns about a major housing crash in the coming year. He noted that although the stock market is at record highs and job growth has been solid, defaults on auto and credit card loans are spiking, spelling distress in some sectors.\nStill, mortgage defaults and foreclosures have remained near record lows after spiking in 2020, showing owners are largely not having trouble paying their mortgages.\n\u201cGiven that there\u2019s very little distress among homeowners, don\u2019t expect any kind of price crash,\u201d he said.\nFederal and local policy could also affect home sales this year. President Donald Trump\u2019s direction for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nbuy $200 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities\nlast week sparked a dip in mortgage rates, which may increase buying power and drive up demand. But Yun said policies to increase supply are needed to prevent a spike in prices.\n\u201cWe have to have supply. Without the supply, extra demand just leads to higher prices and more unaffordability,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to ensure that there\u2019s constant supply coming onto the market as we are trying to produce the demand.\u201d\nPolicies that increase supply could include tax credits for development, Yun said, as well as zoning changes to allow for denser housing.\nIllinois Realtors\nis backing state legislation to expand accessory dwelling units and multi-unit housing developments in more cities around the state.\n",

        "content": "Two Dallas real estate firms are teeing up a new hotel development in Uptown.\nCawley Partners and Alamo Manhattan acquired a small office building at 2909 Cole Avenue with plans to replace it with a roughly $50 million hotel. The partners picked up the 27,000-square-foot property with the intent to keep it operating as an office for now before tearing it down, Cawley Partners CEO Bill Cawley\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nThe companies are working with the city on a rezoning for the site, and groundbreaking is targeted for about 18 months from now, pending entitlements. The planned hotel would have about 140 rooms, and\nCawley\ntold the outlet that the group is already in discussions with two or three potential operators.\n\u201cWith the growth in Uptown, we think there\u2019s a shortage of quality, moderately priced hotel rooms,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the market we are going after.\u201d\nDallas Central Appraisal District records show the Cole Avenue building was completed in 1981 and is valued at roughly $3.8 million for tax purposes. The sale price was not disclosed. Cawley said total development costs are expected to come in at $50.1 million.\nThe deal marks another collaboration between Cawley Partners and\nAlamo Manhattan\n. Last year, the firms teamed up to acquire the five-story, 76,000-square-foot office building at 3400 Carlisle Street, built in 1985. Cawley Partners oversees management and leasing at that property.\nAlamo Manhattan has built a\ntrack record\nin Dallas multifamily and hospitality, including the Marriott Dallas hotel on Fairmount Street. President Matt Segrest described the Uptown project as a chance to fill a niche in the local lodging market with a select-service, extended-stay concept aimed at business and longer-term travelers.\nThe hotel plan also lands amid an active stretch for Cawley Partners. The firm recently acquired the nearly 106,000-square-foot Harwood No. 1 office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, formerly known as the old Rolex building. The seller was First United Trust, and while the purchase price was not disclosed, deed records show Cawley Partners secured a $29.5 million loan to finance the deal.\nThe Harwood property, which opened in 1984 and helped kick off the Harwood District, had fallen into foreclosure from developer Harwood International. Cawley said the firm plans to invest about $10 million in upgrades.\nBeyond Uptown,\nCawley Partners\nis also a co-owner of the Shops at Willow Bend in Plano, a retail property that\u2019s been floated as a possible site for a future Dallas Stars arena.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Multifamily distress at Lurin Capital\nis translating to deteriorating conditions at the firm\u2019s remaining properties, a new lawsuit filed against Jon Venetos\u2019 Dallas-based company shows.\nThe city of Huntsville, Alabama is the latest municipality to sue the firm over conditions at one of its properties. In a Madison County Circuit Court lawsuit filed Jan. 2, the city claims Lurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road.\nThe lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the property Huntsville claims has been vacant for two years, with no utility service, missing windows and doors, a boarded-up exterior, overgrown weeds, siding hanging off of the buildings, a dilapidated metal playset and a pool full of dirty water.\nThe condition \u201cposes a substantial risk of illness or injury to anyone who enters the property,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nThe city first flagged unsafe conditions at the property in February 2022. Lurin obtained building permits for improvements at the property, but didn\u2019t complete all of them, the lawsuit claims.\nIn August, the city sent seven code violation notices to Venetos, giving the company until Dec. 15 to resolve the issues. It failed to do so, the city alleges. It\u2019s asking the court to issue an injunction ordering Lurin to fix the property and order that it be sold if Lurin doesn\u2019t correct the\u00a0 code violations.\nThe lawsuit comes as residents of The Sutton, another Lurin-owned apartment complex in Huntsville, face days without running water, the local NBC affiliate\nreported\n. Residents of the property at 190 Shelton Road told the outlet they\u2019ve been using bottled water to bathe and flush their toilets for nearly a week.\nThe city of Huntsville joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords\nsuing Jon Venetos and his firm over unpaid bills\nand poor conditions at Lurin-owned properties.\nIn November, the firm was hit with a temporary restraining order that ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nAcore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits\nin the spring when it said Venetos defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to 12 properties in Florida. Since then,\nFannie Mae sued Venetos and Lurin\nover an alleged $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and\nstill owes $81 million\n.\nVenetos was also\nsued by his Uptown Dallas office landlord, Rosewood Property Group\n, claiming he personally guaranteed the lease he bailed on at Rosewood Court and owes the landlord $5.3 million.\nThe lawsuits by Keybank and Vista include claims of fraud. Keybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere. Former employees have also come out to accuse Lurin of lying on loan reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done.\n",

In one instance, Block reportedly didn\u2019t pay court sanctions on time, while in another, he created a conflict of interest by representing both a tenant and her landlord.\nCharging \u201cnon-refundable\u201d fees would violate bar regulations that such fees must constitute a \u201ctrue retainer,\u201d or money paid to reserve an attorney\u2019s availability for a specific case or period of time, per LAist.

        "content": "One of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s rare wins tied to the real estate community is now under threat.\nA group of North Side residents known as Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development filed a lawsuit against the city this week seeking to reverse\nan upzoning measure passed in October\nthat would allow for more density along a stretch of North Broadway Street.\nIt allows for taller, denser developments and a wider mix of commercial uses along a three-mile section of the corridor from Devon to Montrose avenues in Edgewater and Uptown.\nThe residents\u2019 group alleges in the suit filed in Cook County Circuit Court that the city council passed the zoning measure without properly informing all affected property owners of the ordinance\u2019s impact and that it constituted government overreach.\n\u201cThe Edgewater upzoning was unprecedented both in terms of the distance covered and the sheer number of properties affected,\u201d the complaint states.\nA representative of the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit is the latest escalation in\nlong simmering tension\nover the measure, which has led to delayed votes and prompted the residents\u2019 group to take out a billboard along North Broadway.\n\u201cStuck in traffic? Can\u2019t find parking? 1,000 new residents won\u2019t help! Say no to upzoning,\u201d the sign reads.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses, including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\nProponents of the measure, including many in the real estate industry, celebrated the upzoning as a way to spur much needed housing in\na historic drought of new multifamily construction that is causing spikes in rent\n.\nIt was a much-needed win for the mayor\u2019s administration vis-\u00e0-vis the industry after he came under fire for a proposed\nincrease to the transfer tax\nand the city council\u2019s support for r\night of first refusal measures\non parts of the Northwest and\nSouth sides\n.\nJohnson has, however,\npushed forward similar YIMBY-style measures\nthroughout the city that curried favor with the real estate industry. In July, the city council passed an ordinance eliminating parking minimums for much of the city. And in 2023, he rolled out the\n\u201cCut the Tape\u201d campaign\naimed at reducing wait times for construction permitting.\nStill, Chicago\u2019s individual aldermen and neighborhood leaders wield significant power on the city council.\nOne alderman successfully lobbied to reduce the impact of an ADU ordinance\nlate last year. And the use of\naldermanic privilege\nto determine the fate of proposed developments in any particular ward remains the\nstandard way of doing business\n, despite its\nbias toward NIMBYism as alleged in a HUD investigation\n.",

        "content": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell quietly joined top Chicago Bears officials last weekend to tour potential sites for a new stadium.\nGoodell toured the Bears\u2019 Arlington Heights property along with two sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond, according to a source familiar with the visit and first\nreported\nby the Chicago Tribune. Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chairman George McCaskey led the tour, which took place Saturday \u2014 hours before the team\u2019s dramatic come-from-behind playoff win over the Green Bay Packers.\nThe commissioner\u2019s presence matters. Any new stadium project would need approval from NFL owners, and the league could provide a loan of $200 million or more to help finance construction. Goodell\u2019s site visit signals that the Bears\u2019 plans have moved beyond local posturing into league-level consideration.\nThe Indiana leg of the tour follows reporting last month that the Bears were exploring options across the\nstate line\n. Since then, Indiana Governor Mike Braun has openly courted the team, pitching a new stadium as an economic development win. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic legislative leaders, by contrast, have drawn a firm line against state-funded\nstadium subsidies\n.\nThe Bears have said they would cover more than $2 billion in stadium construction costs themselves, but want public help with roughly $855 million in infrastructure improvements tied to the former Arlington International Racecourse site they own in\nArlington Heights\n. The team is also seeking changes to Illinois law that would allow it to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies.\nThat request has run into resistance from Chicago lawmakers, who argue along with Gov. Pritzker that the Bears should first help address more than $500 million in remaining debt from the 2003 renovation of\nSoldier Field\n, which the city is still paying off. The Bears\u2019 lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, though the team could exit earlier by paying a penalty.\nWarren previously called for breaking ground on a new enclosed, \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d stadium as soon as last year, with a projected three-year buildout.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is firing back against claims that a\nforeclosure auction\ntied to Worldwide Plaza is a rigged attempt from SL Green and RXR to wrest control of the property.\nAn entity tied to Barnett\u2019s Extell Development filed court papers on Monday calling the lawsuit by the rival landlords meritless and accusing the firms of a last-minute scheme to block a UCC sale they\u2019ve known about for months.\nThe legal fight centers on a planned January 15 foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue, the 1.8 million-square-foot Midtown office complex owned by SL Green and RXR. The landlords sued Barnett to stop the UCC sale, arguing that the auction is commercially unreasonable.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the Worldwide Plaza stake.\nBut Extell says SL Green and RXR are rewriting history.\nIn a memorandum filed in New York Supreme Court, the Barnett-backed mezzanine lender argues that SL Green and RXR have been in default for more than a year and were made aware of the foreclosure auction on October 31. Extell argues the lawsuit makes \u201cno legitimate arguments\u201d to stop the UCC sale, per court documents.\nThe filing also rejects claims that Barnett failed to supply proof that he controls the mezzanine loan, saying Extell made the original note available for inspection by the landlords. Extell also clapped back at claims the auction terms are too restrictive, saying they were explicitly negotiated and approved when the loan was originated.\nExtell also argues that SL Green and RXR cannot show irreparable harm, a key requirement for stopping a foreclosure. The landlords themselves have claimed the property\u2019s value has fallen well below the senior debt, Extell points out, meaning there is no equity left to protect, per the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of mezzanine debt in 2017 that was underwritten by Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group. The property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe senior debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\n\u201cOur filing speaks for itself, and we maintain that the lender attempted to interfere with the revitalization of Worldwide Plaza and its tenants. Our formal response will be filed imminently,\u201d said an SL Green spokesperson.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and RXR did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Extell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A pre-Thanksgiving move-in led by Pacific Coast Healthcare at a vacant building on Ocean Avenue in\nSanta Monica\nhas reignited tensions between Santa Monica officials, affluent neighbors and prominent Los Angeles\ndeveloper Leo Pustilnikov\n.\nUnbeknownst to Pustilnikov, in November, roughly 50 clients of an unpermitted sober living operation arrived in vans late at night and\nbegan occupying an empty Ocean Avenue property\n, the Los Angeles Times reported. The exact address of the building was not disclosed. Ocean Avenue residents spoke out against the neighbors moving in, and city officials imposed fines against Pustilnikov, who leases the buildings. By the following week, the property was cleared out.\nThe empty low-rise buildings at 413 Ocean Avenue, spanning 11,212 square feet, and 825 Ocean Avenue, at 11,256 square feet,\u00a0 have been zoned for use as supportive housing for years, though they are surrounded by upscale condominiums that have sold for as much as $7 million. The buildings were purchased by the Bourne Financial Group in early 2023 for $13 million and are leased by Pustilnikov, who said he aims to earn rental income from them while he seeks change of use permits from the city of Santa Monica.\nThe November dustup was the second time in a span of a few months that Pustilnikov failed to fill the building, as a\nplan to house county behavioral health patients\nat the site last year was also scrapped. Pustilnikov, Bourne Financial Group and St. Joseph Center had approached county mental health officials about using the building, ultimately earning $3.5 million in bridge housing funds to renovate and house homeless residents. The community backlash was swift, and the $3.5 million in funding was canceled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019re not allowed to help people that are struggling in affluent communities,\u201d Pustilnikov told the Times.\nAfter that, Pustilnikov said he was \u201cdone\u201d trying to fill the building until Pacific Coast Healthcare approached him about operating a sober living facility at the site. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, why not?\u2019 It sounded fine. They seem like reputable people,\u201d he told the Times. He leased the property to the company not knowing that the operators hadn\u2019t obtained a business license or move-in approval from the city and were already bussing in residents.\nPustilnikov is now in discussions with the\nLos Angeles County\nDepartment of Mental Health to explore other sites in Santa Monica for housing residents in need of mental healthcare that are closer to existing service providers, county supervisor Lindsey Horvath\u2019s office confirmed to the Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property spans seven buildings, including a 15,000-square-foot amenity building, and is approximately 60 percent leased. The seller\u2019s identity and the building\u2019s addresses were not disclosed.\nThe $600 million purchase grows\nHealthpeak\n\u2019s footprint in South San Francisco to about 6.5 million square feet across 210 acres. The company, previously known as HCP, kicked off the Bay Area biotech construction boom in 2015 with the first phase of South San Francisco\u2019s 800,000-square-foot Cove at Oyster Point development. Since then, millions of square feet of life sciences and biotech space have been built in the Peninsula city.\nAs\nfederal funds for life sciences\nand research have dried up over the past year, firms have shied away from building more office and research space in South San Francisco and beyond. Biotech developer IQHQ is\nlooking to pause development\non 857,000 square feet of its Spur project in South San Francisco, and Forge Development is seemingly\nbacking away from its initial proposal\nfor a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus in Berkeley.\nHealthpeak hasn\u2019t been immune to the downturn. In the last quarter of 2025, the company sold approximately $325 million outpatient medical assets totaling about 834,000 square feet. The firm also said it is negotiating sales for additional outpatient medical facilities as well as recapitalizations and loan repayments that could generate an additional $700 million or more in proceeds.\nVacancy in the Northern Peninsula life sciences market, including South San Francisco, was\nat 39.8 percent\nat the end of the third quarter of last year, per CBRE\u2019s Q3 report. But this year could bring changes, as active tenant requirements increased 73 percent across the Bay Area compared to the previous quarter and 62 percent year-over-year, according to Bisnow.\nSteelWave is among those betting on a comeback, as the firm is\nmoving forward with its plan\nto turn the Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Francisco into a 2.5-million-square-foot, five-building life sciences campus.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lennar Homes officially backed away from a key regulatory step for a large, controversial residential development outside San Antonio, withdrawing an application for a wastewater treatment facility that would have supported the project.\nThe Miami-based builder recently pulled its application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for a permit tied to its proposed Comfort 590 development, according to a filing\nobtained\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The move removes a critical piece of infrastructure for the planned subdivision in Comfort, an unincorporated Kendall County community about 45 miles northwest of downtown\nSan Antonio\n.\nLennar, the nation\u2019s\nsecond-largest homebuilder\n, proposed building roughly 1,100 homes on about 600 acres along Highway 87, with entitlements allowing capacity for another 1,300 units. Because the area lacks centralized sewer service, the project hinged on a standalone wastewater treatment system capable of disposing of up to 600,000 gallons per day.\nThe\ncompany\nformally withdrew the permit application on Dec. 22. Lennar declined to comment on the decision or clarify whether it still intends to pursue the development.\nThe pullback marked a milestone for local opponents. Comfort Neighbors, a grassroots group formed to fight the project, hailed the withdrawal as a major win after more than a year of organizing against what it described as an outsized, high-density development for a town of roughly 3,000 residents.\nThe group includes landowners adjacent to the proposed site, who raised concerns about water availability, wastewater impacts and broader strain on local infrastructure. Members have argued that the development would threaten air and water quality and undermine the area\u2019s rural character, according to the publication. Over the past year, Comfort Neighbors has staged town halls, community meetings and a rally in June to oppose the project.\nThe episode is a familiar tune for Lennar in the region, though not one from which the builder is used to backing down. Two other Lennar developments are grappling with infrastructure limits and increasingly organized local resistance.\nAnother proposed 600,000-gallon wastewater permit is under review for the builder\u2019s proposed 850-home Broken Cedar Ranch in Comal County, north of San Antonio, that would pump treated wastewater into nearby Canyon Lake. TCEQ scheduled a\npublic meeting\nto address the development for Feb. 10 at Canyon Lake High School.\nA proposed 2,900-home development,\nGuajolote Ranch\n, northwest of San Antonio near the suburb of Helotes did receive a wastewater permit, despite local opposition. It allows discharge of up to 1 million gallons daily into Helotes Creek, a tributary that feeds the Edwards Aquifer, which is a drinking water source for more than 2.5 million people across 13 counties, according to the Edwards Aquifer Authority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s highest court on Tuesday upheld the city\u2019s ability to charge owners a fee when converting apartments reserved for artists, reversing a lower court\u2019s ruling that the practice was unconstitutional.\nThe New York Court of Appeals, in a 6-1\ndecision\n, found that a state Appellate Court wrongfully\nconcluded\nthat a portion of the 2021 Soho and Noho rezoning violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s takings clause.\nAs part of the rezoning, new rules were applied to so-called Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists, which are reserved for artists certified by the city. Owners of such units must pay $100 per square foot to an arts fund run by the city before receiving approval from City Planning to convert the apartments for other use.\nCritics of the fee argued that it stood in the way of owners bringing their properties into compliance with the law. The state\u2019s multiple dwelling law was\namended\nin 2022 to allow non-artists who lived in JLWQA units on or before the rezoning was approved to continue to inhabit the apartments legally. But if a non-artist tries to buy such a property, they would need to convert the artist units before legally occupying them or renting them out to non-artist tenants.\nThe Coalition for Fairness in Soho and Noho, a group representing owners and residents of the neighborhoods, filed a lawsuit in February 2022, seeking to annul the rezoning, which allowed more residential and commercial use within a 50-block area.\nWhen a state Supreme Court sided with the city, the coalition appealed, but focused on the artists\u2019 fee rather than the entire rezoning. A panel of Appellate Division judges\nreversed\nthe lower court\u2019s decision in December 2024, finding the fee to be unconstitutional and without any legitimate land-use rationale.\nBut the Court of Appeals found that hitting a property owner with a standalone fee doesn\u2019t invoke the takings clause. Such a \u201cmonetary exaction\u201d must be in lieu of a transfer of a private property interest to qualify as a violation of the clause.\n\u201cPetitioners may desire a property interest in a more valuable and less restrictive form, and they may want it without strings attached, but the opportunity to relinquish one form of property to acquire another, in exchange for a monetary payment to an arts fund, is not a taking,\u201d Judge Jenny Rivera wrote.\nAttorneys for the coalition, along with Judge Michael Garcia, the lone dissenting opinion, argue that the fact that the government is making a monetary demand tied to a specific property interest as a condition of receiving permits is enough to constitute an illegal taking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false distinction between real property and money that the court drew,\u201d said Chris Kieser, an attorney for the coalition.\nHe said his clients are considering whether to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.\nThe city legalized JLWQAs in the manufacturing districts of Soho in the 1970s. As the area transformed, turning into a sought-after residential neighborhood, technically illegal ground-floor retail and residential lofts sprouted up as the number of certified artists in the city declined. As of 2022, only 36 of the city\u2019s 1,636 JLWQA units were occupied by certified artists, and the city had certified fewer than 100 artists in the preceding decade.\nThe city rarely enforced the artist units\u2019 residency requirements, and the Adams administration stopped efforts to increase penalties for violations.\nKieser said the city is holding conversions of these units hostage, even as it wants to end the program (new JLWQA units can\u2019t be created) and make way for affordable housing. The Soho and Noho rezoning was supposed to pave the way for more than 3,000 units of housing over the next decade, though\nprogress\nhas been slow.\nA spokesperson for the city\u2019s Law Department said he was pleased by the decision.\n",

        "content": "Some years ago, the Woodland Hills Country Club in Los Angeles County sold its 94-acre golf course.\nToday, hundreds of local residents are flocking to meetings and rallies to stop a\n398-home project\non 20 acres of that land.\nOne of the opponents was a member of the club when it decided to sell. \u201cWe needed the money,\u201d he told another person at one opposition meeting. But the buyer was a developer, Arrimus Capital of Newport Beach, so the proposal could not have been a surprise.\nWhat was a surprise \u2014 at least to the furious locals \u2014 is that the project apparently does not need the usual public hearings, environmental reviews and political approval that have made Los Angeles one of the tightest and most expensive housing markets in the nation. For this very reason, the fast track was created in the past four years by state legislation (\nAB2011 and AB2243\n).\nNIMBY fights are usually about size and affordability, but these issues mean very different things in different places, as the Woodland Hills fight shows.\nIn New York City, rezonings tend to be for multifamily buildings in progressive neighborhoods, where opponents demand shorter buildings and more affordability.\nIn suburban areas, opponents tend to be single-family homeowners who want projects to have fewer units and less affordability, because they fear traffic and poor people.\nThe Woodland Hills project will have 97 affordable apartments, most of them for seniors. Another 175 homes will be single-family and 126 will be apartments. It adds up to 76 percent market-rate and 24 percent affordable, which in Crown Heights would have people screaming \u201cgentrification!\u201d\nThe NIMBYs of Woodland Hills \u2014 a community of\n80,000 people\n\u2014 are mostly aghast at the idea of having about 800 new neighbors. This 1 percent population increase, they say, would cause gridlock in the event of a fire disaster like the one they witnessed from their cul-de-sacs last winter.\nI am not persuaded. If there\u2019s gridlock during a fire, 99 percent of it would be caused by the current residents. If the situation were as dangerous as they claim, they would be moving out en masse, or the government would be condemning their homes. That isn\u2019t happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s proposals to address rising insurance costs for multifamily housing amount to anything? What about her promise to reform J-51? See pages 32 to 35 of her\nState of the State Book\nand send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: If you have a New York building with\nlarge refrigeration equipment\n, you must report its leakage rate to the state Department of Environmental Conservation in March or face a fine of up to $2,500 plus $500 per day after that. The deadline for medium-sized equipment is June. The idea is to curb leaks that contribute to climate change.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRent control, a poster child among economists for the wrong way to address housing affordability, could be returning to Massachusetts \u2014 not because socialists have taken over the legislature, but because a proposal appears destined for the statewide ballot in November.\nOne poll found 63 percent of voters would support and only 31 percent would oppose the proposal, which would cap rent increases at 5 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.\nHousing guru Jay Parsons is raising alarms.\n\u201cMassachusetts voters banned rent control in the 1990s due to numerous unintended consequences. Studies by MIT and Harvard later showed the REMOVAL of rent caps led to reduced crime, improved building maintenance and improved property values,\u201d he\nposted on LinkedIn\n.\n\u201cBut this is a new generation of voters \u2014 few of whom likely remember the reasons they banned rent control three decades ago.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$8.15 million\nfor a 4,440-square-foot townhouse at 409 Sackett Street in Carroll Gardens. Ellen Gottleib and Neely Johnson with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$141 million\nfor the 283,465-square-foot, 19-story office building at 3 East 54th Street in Sutton Place. Cohen Brothers Realty sold the property to Vornado.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 416 West 51st Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019\nMeasure ULA transfer tax\nhas crossed a significant revenue threshold.\nNearly three years after being implemented, proceeds from so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d have\nexceeded $1 billion\n, Commercial Observer reported. Under the ordinance, transactions for properties between $5.3 million and $10.6 million incur an additional 4 percent tax, and deals for $10.6 million or more trigger a 5.5 percent tax. City officials have long said that money earned from the transfer tax will go toward funding affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.\nAs of Jan. 8, Measure ULA has generated more than $1 billion from 1,435 transactions, according to Los Angeles Housing Department data cited by CO. Of those deals, 60 percent were for single-family residences, 24 percent were for nonresidential commercial properties and 13 percent were for multifamily sales. The ZIP codes of 90049, 90272 and 90077, encompassing top-tier Los Angeles neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Bel Air and\nPacific Palisades\n, accounted for the largest share of sales producing ULA funds.\nThe amount of money coming in from ULA, implemented April 1, 2023, is growing with each fiscal year. Over the past six months, the ordinance collected $306.7 million, meaning it will likely surpass the previous year\u2019s $413.2 million before the end of the fiscal year in June. The resulting cash on hand has led to the largest\nnotice of funding availability, or NOFA\n, in Los Angeles Housing Department history.\nNearly 74 percent of ULA funds in fiscal year 2025-26 are allocated for\naffordable housing\nprograms, such as multifamily development, preserving property affordability and a homeownership opportunities initiative prioritizing first-time buyers and local land trusts. The rest of the money is set aside for homelessness prevention programs, including short-term emergency assistance, eviction defense, and income support for seniors and persons with disabilities.\nCommercial real estate executives have been outspoken in\ntheir opposition\nto ULA, with some choosing to\ninvest outside of Los Angeles\ncity limits entirely. Universe Holdings decided to pause or cancel transactions in L.A. due to the tax, selling several properties in early 2023 before ULA went into effect, and the company hadn\u2019t bought or sold any as of last spring, according to CO.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\npanel in September. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nuveen has taken ownership of the 35-story office tower at\n321 North Clark Street\n, marking the latest slipup in a series of mezzanine loan gambles that have shifted from passive investments into losses or active ownership for the asset manager.\nChicago-based Nuveen, in partnership with Los Angeles-based\nPacific Coast Capital Partners (PCCP)\nthrough a co-managed fund, completed a takeover of the 897,000-square-foot River North property. The transaction wiped out the equity of the previous ownership venture \u2014 consisting of Larry Levy\u2019s Chicago-based Diversified Real Estate Capital, Houston-based Hines and Los Angeles-based American Realty Advisors.\nThe deal underscores the ongoing distress in the office market and risks associated with mezzanine debt positions taken before interest rates jumped in 2022. Nuveen provided a\n$296 million in floating rate loan for the property in 2021\n, then sold off a $222 million first mortgage portion of the debt to a consortium of German banks, while keeping an approximately $74 million mezzanine position, according to public records and people familiar with the property\u2019s financing.\nNow, Nuveen\u2019s mezzanine position has been converted into an ownership interest, according to a spokesperson for the firm, which is the real estate investment arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the pooled asset manager for educator retirement accounts. It\u2019s unclear how much cash PCCP brought to the table to enter the deal, as Nuveen declined to answer detailed questions about the size of their respective stakes in the property.\nDiversified, PCCP, Hines and American Realty Advisors didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nFor Nuveen, 321 North Clark adds to a\nseries of office troubles\nwhere mezzanine loans it originated to Chicago office landlords didn\u2019t go as planned, wiping out investments, or, in this case, requiring a pivot to hands-on ownership. Mezzanine loans Nuveen funded have sunk with borrowers such as\nBlackstone at 350 North Orleans Street\n, which is currently facing foreclosure, as well as\nSterling Bay at 600 West Chicago Avenue\n, which sold for just $89 million last year after fetching $510 million in 2018.\nDespite the circumstances of the takeover, Nuveen is signaling aggressive moves to stabilize the asset. The firm announced that it hired Telos Group as the new leasing agent for the 936,000-square-foot tower, replacing Hines in that capacity. Hines will, however, retain its role as property manager.\nNuveen emphasized that the property is \u201copen for business\u201d and well-capitalized to compete for tenants in a fierce leasing market.\n\u201cWe have capital available to invest in tenant improvements, leasing incentives and property enhancements \u2014 sending a strong signal to the leasing community that 321 North Clark has stable, well-capitalized ownership dedicated to creating a best-in-class tenant experience,\u201d a Nuveen spokesperson said.\nThe firm\u2019s venture with PCCP plans to deploy additional equity capital to modernize the building, including upgrades to the conference center and tenant lounge areas.\nNuveen declined to disclose specific occupancy figures but reaffirmed its confidence in the property\u2019s long-term value. CBRE, the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate brokerage, was previously one of the building\u2019s prominent tenants until it left the property to\nmove into 300 North LaSalle Street\nin recent months.\n",

        "content": "A small, distressed River North office building is headed for a residential reset, as a local developer leans into Chicago\u2019s growing wave of modest office-to-apartment conversions.\nChicago-based Monroe Residential Partners paid $5.4 million for the four-story, 48,000-square-foot loft-style office building at 401 West Ontario Street, with plans to convert the property into 57 apartments, firm founder Drew Friestedt told Crain\u2019s, which first\nreported\nthe sale. The sale adds another bite-sized project to downtown\u2019s conversion pipeline, where underused offices are increasingly giving way to housing.\nThe building, which is roughly half leased, became financially untenable as offices, Friestedt said. It was also the subject of a foreclosure suit filed in 2024.\n\u201cThe revenue from rent is barely enough to cover your real estate taxes,\u201d\nFriestedt\ntold the outlet. \u201cThe common theme is they don\u2019t work as office buildings anymore, and they\u2019re selling to people who can try to make the building work as residential.\u201d\nMonroe is budgeting about $20 million all-in for the project, including the acquisition, and is currently lining up construction financing. The firm aims to break ground in October and complete the conversion roughly a year later.\nPlans call for a mix of compact one-bedroom units of about 450 square feet, with starting rents of about $2,300 a month, alongside larger two-bedroom, duplex-style apartments measuring roughly 1,200 square feet and renting for as much as $3,800. The pricing reflects continued strength in downtown apartment demand, even as new supply remains muted.\nThe project will require zoning relief. While the site\u2019s DX-7 zoning allows residential use above the ground floor, Monroe plans to add ground-floor units, triggering the need for approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals.\nMonroe Residential Partners has built a portfolio of mixed-use and residential projects, including developments at 851 West Grand Avenue and 1313 West Randolph Street.\nGreenstone Partners broker Jordan Multack represented Monroe in the latest deal, while Frontline Real Estate Partners served as receiver and marketed the property.\nThe seller was a venture led by Chicago investor Sean Conlon, who bought the building for $6.6 million in 2015. After being hit with a\nforeclosure suit\ntied to a 2017 mortgage, the property was marketed through a receivership sale.\nConlon\ntold the publication that he ultimately sold the building in full satisfaction of the loan after it failed to make \u201ceconomic sense\u201d amid high property taxes.\nThe deal comes as Chicago\u2019s broader development pipeline\nremains thin\n. Just three large-scale downtown projects totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Solano County exurb of\nVacaville\n, once an escape from the expensive rents and home prices of San Francisco and other cities closer to the Bay, is now becoming another housing crisis hotspot.\nIn Vacaville, considered an exurb because it is a growing residential area located beyond the suburbs, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment\nhas more than doubled\nsince 2010 to approximately $2,500 from about $1,200, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nAcross Solano County, the cities of Vacaville and Vallejo now have the Bay Area\u2019s greatest share of\ncost-burdened renters\n. More than 70 percent of renters in both cities spend at least 30 percent of their pre-tax income on housing, far above the regional average of 56 percent of renters and national levels hovering at around 50 percent, the Chronicle reported, citing U.S. Census Bureau data. Over the past five years, Vacaville\u2019s percentage of cost-burdened renters has increased faster than any other Bay Area city.\nThe hike in rents in Vacaville comes despite a building blitz in the city. Between 2015 and 2021, developers completed about 2,900 residential units in the city, more than double its state housing target and enough to make it one of the Bay Area\u2019s top housing producers by raw volume.\nThe issue is with the type of housing that is being built \u2014 mostly higher-end single-family homes.\nMultifamily housing\n, including townhomes and small apartment buildings, comprises less than 10 percent of Vacaville\u2019s housing stock.\nCash buyers relocating from pricier Bay Area markets bid up home prices as renters face limited supply and rising rents. The city of Vacaville is also facing projected budget deficits of about $9 million and a hiring freeze for local government.\nWith a dearth of multifamily and below-market-rate housing, younger workers might not be able to make ends meet in the Solano County city.\n\u201cThese outlying cities really are the next frontier of displacement,\u201d Cristal Gallegos, director of community-led nonprofit Vallejo Housing Justice Coalition, told the Chronicle. \u201cOnce the old adage of \u2018\ndrive until you qualify\n[for a mortgage]\u2019 stops applying to the Bay Area, you know you have a serious problem.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth area homes depreciated slightly in 2025.\nMedian home sale prices fell below 2024 in all counties in the Fort Worth area, according to the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors and the Texas Real Estate Research Center. Most of the regional declines are shallow, but in Denton County, one of the state\u2019s hottest home development hubs, prices fell more steeply.\nIn Fort Worth proper, the 2025 median sale price was $330,000, down 1.5 percent from the year prior. Tarrant County overall was practically unchanged, with a price decline of 0.3 percent at $349,000. Johnson County to the south and Parker County to the west experienced declines of 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.\n\u201cI would call that, in my professional opinion, a flat market,\u201d said Jim Fite, CEO of Century 21 Judge Fite, a leading North Texas brokerage. \u201cIf I\u2019m a seller, an owner, my equity is not being withered away. And as a buyer, I can\u2019t just go out and steal a house now.\u201d\nDenton County, which straddles Fort Worth and Dallas to the north, is a notable outlier.\nDenton County experienced a 4.3 percent decline in home prices from 2024 to 2025, falling to a median of $445,000. In December alone, prices fell almost 10 percent, year-over-year.\nWhile sales and prices tend to move in tandem, they diverged in Denton County last year, with the number of closed sales rising by a steady 2.2 percent in December while prices fell, according to the MetroTex Association of Realtors.\nHomebuilding may play a part in the trend. Developers have been blitzing north from Dallas for years, with\nactivity especially concentrated along the Dallas North Tollway\n, but also spreading laterally.\nCelina\n, which Denton County partially includes, is\none of the hottest residential markets in the state\n. Pilot Point, wholly contained in Denton County,\nboomed\nduring the pandemic and\ncontinues to attract developers\u2019 interest\n. Denton itself has drawn billions in investment, including a\nPerot family project\nthat will deliver 6,000 single-family homes and 3,000 apartments.\nOther upcoming single-family projects include the\nCole Ranch\nand the\nAlpha Ranch\n, both set to have over 4,000 homes apiece, and the\nFurst Ranch\n, expected to have 1,300 homes. Multifamily development in the pipeline includes\nChadwick Farms\n, a mixed-use project with 900 apartments and a hotel, and\nThe Renegade\n, a Holt Lunsford Commercial project in downtown Denton.\n",

Rounding out the year at negative 311,369 square feet, it far exceeded negative 4 million square feet from 2021, and has steadily increased since then. The fourth quarter recorded a negative absorption of 439,859 square feet, breaking the market\u2019s two-quarter stretch of positive absorption.\nVacancies, while still elevated, have decreased to 26.3 percent after peaking at nearly 27 percent in 2024. But, like Dallas, return to work mandates and a narrowing development pipeline have helped the Houston office market perk up.\nSubmarkets on top\nOf the city\u2019s office submarkets, the Galleria performed best in the fourth quarter, JLL reported.\nThe Galleria logged nearly 200,000 square feet of positive absorption, thanks to Texas Dow Employees Credit Union\u2019s move to 121,000 square feet at the building at 2000 Post Oak Boulevard and Camden Property Trust\u2019s relocation to 104,000 square feet at the building at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard.\nThe Galleria also came in second in terms of annual net absorption, recording nearly 341,000 square feet of positive office space absorption. The suburbs closest to Houston topped the list with more than 555,000 square feet of absorption for the year. Katy Freeway West, the western part of I-10 stretching from Houston to Katy, came in third on the list. It logged 215,000 square feet of positive absorption by the end of the year.\nThe Galleria\u2019s high absorption rate marks a win for the submarket that had an elevated vacancy rate of 32 percent at the end of 2025. The retail hotspot has about 22.5 million square feet of office space.\nThe submarket could expect a boost after being selected for one of the city\u2019s coveted branded condo projects.\nDeiso Moss\nannounced plans to develop a 44-story hotel and condo tower at 2120 Post Oak Boulevard, as the city races to level up its branded condo offerings.\nOffice trades\nOffice building sales inched up in 2025, compared to 2024, to 9.7 million square feet \u2014 a slight edge over 2024\u2019s 9.5 million square feet.\nLast year, Houston office operators made lemonade out of the city\u2019s glut of old office space. Of the\ntop 10 largest office trades\n, at least five were distress-related sales, including the\nbiggest office sale of 2025\n, in which Houston\u2019s largest office complex, Houston Center returned to its lender, AustralianSuper.\nTwo of the top sales involved buildings eyed for conversion. Chicago-based 3L Real Estate plans to convert\nOne City Center\n, at 1021 Main Street, into 93 corporate suites for visiting employees and 460 traditional apartments.\nThe market\u2019s low valuations and excess of old space made way for\nowner-occupiers\nto enter the market. These buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the Houston office market in 2025, Partners Real Estate reported..\nThe closest thing to a trophy office trade on the list was the sale of Energy Center I, an Energy Corridor office building at 585 North Dairy Ashford that was built in 2008 and renovated in 2020.\nExperts predict trophy trades will ratchet up this year.\n\u201cAs high quality space and stable ownership increasingly drive tenant decisions, competition for premium properties is expected to intensify throughout 2026,\u201d JLL\u2019s\u2019 report said.\n",

So far, 168 deeds have recorded, totaling $425.3 million in sales.\nLed by Bob Vail, Kolter Urban is the condo development division of Bobby Julien\u2019s Delray Beach-based Kolter Group.\nThe project is just shy of a decade in the making.\nKolter started acquiring the 2.6-acre site for the project in 2017, spending $34.4 million across several purchases. Kolter\nlaunched sales\nfor the towers in 2021 and secured\na $240 million construction loan\nfrom Wells Fargo in 2022. Designed by Kobi Karp Architects and interiors firm ID &amp; Design International, the project was initially slated to finish in 2024.\nSelene\u2019s units range from two- to four-bedrooms that span between 2,300 and 5,300 square feet, according to a news release. The towers also have a few larger penthouse units. Amenities in the buildings include two pools, a fitness center, a business center, a theater, a gaming lounge and\nprivate dining space\n.\nThe most expensive closing in the towers so far was Beau Aero and Alfredo Martin\u2019s $12.2 million purchase of the 5,300-square-foot unit S2701, records show. That sale amounted to $2,300 per square foot. Beau Aero Martin founded a workwear company based in Columbia, Missouri.\nM. Michele Burns, the former CEO of Mercer and a member of the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors, bought unit S2702 for $10.7 million, according to property records.\nTwenty-two units remain to be sold, priced between $2.7 million and $11.7 million, a spokesperson confirmed.\nSelene is one of the latest completed projects in\na packed pipeline of Broward County residential developments\n.\nLong passed over by developers for the glitzier markets in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County, as the region has boomed post-pandemic, developers have\nturned their gaze to Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach\n. At least two dozen projects totaling more than 3,900 units are in the works, led by some of South Florida\u2019s biggest names: Jorge P\u00e9rez, Edgardo Defortuna, Isaac Toledano and Miki Naftali, among others.\nJulien is onto the next one in another market, though.

        "content": "Crescent Real Estate closed its latest investment fund, pulling in $241.5 million for commercial real estate moves, as fundraising across private equity remains under pressure.\nThe Fort Worth-based firm wrapped up what it called \u201cGP Invitation Fund IV\u201d on Dec. 31, falling shy of its $250 million target, according to federal filings. The raise marks Crescent\u2019s fourth invitation fund and comes three years after the company collected $265 million for Fund III in 2022 through a similarly invitation-only process, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe closing offers a snapshot of a tougher capital raising climate. Global private equity fundraising slid for a third straight year in 2025, dropping 12.7 percent to $480.3 billion from $551.2 billion in 2024, according to S&amp;P Global. Fewer funds came to market as well, a slowdown that cut across buyout, growth and diversified strategies.\nChristopher Goff\n, senior managing director and head of capital formation at Crescent, described 2025 as an \u201cadjustment year\u201d after the easy money era that followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s pandemic-era rate cuts. Inflation and higher borrowing costs have since reset expectations.\nEven so, Crescent wasted little time\ndeploying capital\n. Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 told the outlet that about 15 percent to 20 percent of Fund IV has already been committed, including multiple Uptown Dallas office deals that closed late last year. Those included the 19-story building at\n2100 McKinney\n, anchored by CBRE, and the\nTexas Capital Center\nat 2000 McKinney Avenue, which several market sources pegged as the largest office sale in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nThe fund\u2019s flexible mandate allows Crescent to invest across office, residential and hotel projects, rather than locking into a single property type. Lately, trophy offices have emerged as the firm\u2019s highest conviction play, even as many institutional investors remain wary of the sector, according to Goff.\nCrescent was founded in 1987 by John Goff and the late Richard Rainwater and reported $4.3 billion in assets under management at the end of 2024. Across all strategies, the company controls more than $16 billion of real estate, including 67 million square feet of offices, 10,100 apartments and 9,300 hotel keys, according to its website.\nIn North Texas, Crescent continues to double down on Uptown, where it owns the iconic Crescent complex, reacquired in 2021, and is advancing construction on the second office building at its Crescent Fort Worth development, anchored by JPMorgan Chase.\nWhile the firm has expressed interest in seeing Dallas thrive broadly \u2014 including Downtown, which faces fresh headwinds after AT&amp;T\u2019s announced exit \u2014 Crescent\u2019s strategy remains tightly focused.\n\u201cWe want to be super disciplined,\u201d Goff said. \u201cWhere do we feel like we have a comparative advantage? And where do our investors feel like we can operate better than anybody else?\u201d\nFor now, that answer points squarely to Uptown Dallas \u2014 and to offices \u2014 even as much of the market stays on the sidelines.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The move comes months after ownership defaulted on the debt at the outdoor shopping center, stretching from West 97th to West 100th Street on Columbus Avenue.\nChetrit and Stellar began missing monthly $1.9 million debt payments in August, according to the lawsuit. Chetrit vowed to make good on the back payments and resume monthly payments after receiving a\ndefault notice in October\n, but failed to actually do so, according to the suit, leading to another default notice this month.\nOwnership allegedly owes $370 million, including more than $7 million in interest and late charges.\nLaw firms for the defendants either declined to comment or did not respond to the publication\u2019s request. No legal response has been filed either.\nThe 270,000-square-foot shopping center is anchored by Whole Foods and Target. The debt has been in special servicing at least twice, including once in late 2023 due to tenant distress from the pandemic, leading to a three-year extension on the mortgage.\nThe shopping center is separate from a five-building, 710-unit multifamily portfolio that sits above the retail portion of the complex. In August, UDR, the Colorado-based multifamily real estate investment trust, and its partner MetLife began exploring a sale of the rental portion of the property for\nup to $500 million\n.\nFour of the five buildings are free market; the fifth is subject to an older 421a agreement under which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting their legal rent limits.\nUDR teamed up with MetLife in 2012 to buy the portfolio from the late Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar and the Chetrit Organization for\n$635 million\n.\n",

Their footprint ballooned during the pandemic-era population surge, as institutional capital chased fast-growing Sun Belt markets.\nBy some estimates, corporate investors now own between 20 and 25 percent of Florida\u2019s single-family rental homes.\nThat buying spree has fueled backlash from would-be homeowners and\npoliticians\n, who argue that deep-pocketed landlords are crowding them out and shrinking an already tight supply of homes for sale.\nTrump has offered few details on how a ban would work, in statements that marked his first major foray into the housing affordability debate. He is expected to outline the proposal more fully at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland later this month.\nFlorida has been a cash cow for large-scale rental operators.\nInvitation Homes\n, the nation\u2019s largest single-family rental landlord and a former Blackstone unit, generated $556 million in revenue from Florida properties in the first nine months of last year, according to financial filings. The company manages nearly 27,000 homes statewide, with a portfolio valued at $4.2 billion.\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent\nowns almost 8,700 single-family properties in Florida worth roughly $2.1 billion. Privately held firms such as Progress Residential,\nTricon Residential\nand\nFirstKey Homes\ncontrol tens of thousands more units, though their exact holdings are harder to pin down. One estimate put the number of Florida single-family homes owned by corporate investors at 117,000 as of late 2024, the outlet said.\nSmaller players have joined the rush, too.\nTampa-based Second Avenue\nraised $250 million in 2022 after quietly building a single-family rental platform since 2017.\nEconomists are skeptical that a ban would meaningfully move the needle.\n\u201cInstitutional investors own about 20 percent of the single-family rental market nationally, so it\u2019s not a big part of the housing stock,\u201d Jeff Korzenik, chief economist at Fifth Third Bank, told the outlet. \u201cThe reality is that affordability comes down to supply, and who owns that supply is a less important factor.\u201d\n\u2014 Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "A Burr Ridge mansion that former Bulls center Eddy Curry once lost through foreclosure sold on Tuesday for $4 million, the most expensive sale in the western Chicago suburb in more than a year.\nThe sprawling home at 6655 Lee Court has seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms and covers 14,600 square feet. Built in 2006, it sits on a one-acre lot on an exclusive cul-de-sac, next door to the house owned by late rapper Juice WRLD\u2019s mother,\nCarmela Wallace\n.\nThe home went on the market in June last year asking nearly $5 million. The price dropped to $4.5 million in September, and it went under contract in November. The sale price is over $2 million less than what Curry paid for the house in 2006.\nRafael Murillo, the Compass agent who represented the buyers, confirmed the sale and said his clients bought the house because it offered a secluded, exclusive location while still being near downtown Chicago.\nThe suburb\nis a little over 20 miles from downtown.\n\u201cThe amount of land here is something you simply won\u2019t find in nearby communities like Hinsdale or other close-in suburbs, where lots are far more limited,\u201d Murillo said.\nHe declined to name the buyers, but said they plan to make renovations to the home, including adding an outdoor kitchen and a pool. Public records that could reveal the identity of the buyers aren\u2019t yet recorded in Cook County.\n\u201cBuilding a home of this caliber from the ground up today would likely cost double the list price \u2014 or more \u2014 purely in construction costs,\u201d Murillo said.\nGinny Stewart and Paige Kelly of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the sellers. Stewart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe home features an attached \u201ctownhome-like suite,\u201d according to listing information, with a separate entrance and its own kitchen, laundry and bedrooms. The primary suite covers 1,800 square feet and includes a fireplace, sitting area and two walk in closets.\nCurry bought the house in 2006 for $6.1 million. At the time, he was playing for the New York Knicks after four years with the Bulls. In 2007, Curry\u2019s lender, Morgan Stanley Credit Corp, moved to foreclose on the house. The proceedings lasted until 2014, when Curry handed the house over to a loan servicing agency.\nIn 2007, Curry and his family were robbed at gunpoint in the house, according to reporting from the time. The offenders were also later charged in connection to a robbery of then-Miami Heat player Antoine Walker that same year.\nOral surgeon Louis Korompilas bought the house out of foreclosure for a discounted $3.1 million in 2014, according to property records. He transferred the property to family members in 2020, but it was transferred back to a trust under his name shortly before it went up for sale last year, property records show.\nThe owners paid $45,500 in property taxes in 2024, records show.\nThe $4 million price tag makes it the most expensive house to sell in Burr Ridge since July 2024, when a home on Cabernet Court brought in $5 million, listing services show. Wallace\npaid $6.9 million\nfor her Lee Court home in 2022 \u2014 along with $1.4 million for an adjacent parcel \u2014 setting the record for a home sale price in Burr Ridge, according to listing services. She\nlisted the home for sale\nin a private network in September, asking $7.2 million.\nTwo other homes in Burr Ridge are asking more than $4 million. A 13,900-square-foot estate with a stone facade and terracotta roof hit the market in July and is now asking $5.7 million. A 9,300-square-foot \u201cgentleman\u2019s farm\u201d with grandfathered horse rights on 7.6 acres is\nasking $10 million\n, which would mark a record for the suburb if it fetches that price.\nThe $1 million drop from the Lee Court home\u2019s initial asking price could be a sign those homes will need to cut their ask to find buyers. But Murillo said Tuesday\u2019s sale bodes well for those other properties, showing a sign that buyers are interested and inventory is dwindling.\n\u201cWith confidence in the luxury market and so few options available, it\u2019s really only a matter of time before those homes go under contract,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Oak Brook-based commercial real estate giant Inland Real Estate Group is going through another leadership shakeup.\nMatthew Fries, formerly of financial services and wealth management firm Cetera Financial Group, was named CEO of Inland Investments, a Tuesday press release said. Inland Investments is the arm of the Inland Real Estate Group that serves retail investors.\nFries will be the fourth person to hold the position since early 2024. He will be in charge of the company\u2019s public and private investment platforms and retail investor-focused offerings. In his prior role, Fired served as Cetera\u2019s head of investment products.\nHe will take over for Inland Investments\u2019 interim CEO Ella Neyland and will report to Tony Chereso, who is CEO of the Inland family of companies, known collectively as Inland Real Estate Group, according to the release.\nNeyland will remain in a leadership role as CEO of the Inland REIT, IPC Alternative Real Estate Income Trust.\nNeyland stepped in as interim CEO of Inland Investments when its former CEO, Keith D. Lampi, resigned in October. Lampi had been with the company since 2001 and held the position of Inland Investments CEO for nearly two years.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Lampi left the company, although SEC filings indicate his resignation was \u201cnot due to any disagreement with the company, its advisor or any of its and their affiliates,\u201d the filing read.\nDuring Lampi\u2019s tenure, Inland Real Estate Group restructured much of its executive ranks to consolidate operations among Inland Private Capital Corporation (the company\u2019s tax-deferred investment arm), Inland Venture Partners (the company\u2019s private equity arm), and Inland Securities Corporation (the company\u2019s dealer manager for Inland investment vehicles). The effort was part of Lampi\u2019s long-term vision for the company, a prior press release stated.\nLampi had taken over the Inland Investments CEO position from Mitchell Sabshon\n, a longtime Inland executive who retired in early 2024. Around the same time, Inland Real Estate Group co-founder and CEO\nDaniel Goodwin\ndied and was succeeded by Chesero.\nA month prior to that, co-founder and CEO of Inland\u2019s acquisitions arm,\nJoseph Cosenza\n, died as well. He was succeeded by his son Mark Cosenza and longtime Inland executive Matthew Tice.\nThe Inland family of companies is one of the country\u2019s largest real estate investment firms with $125 billion in transactions since its founding in 1968. It currently employs over 1,200 people and operates in 49 states, according to its website.\nNew York-based DRA Advisors acquired a huge Inland business line in 2016, when it assumed the firm\u2019s 132-property, $2.3 billion real estate portfolio concentrated on Midwest shopping centers, which operated under the IRC Retail Centers banner.\nDRA\nover the last few years has shed a notable portion of the Midwest portfolio\n, worth an estimated $540 million.",

        "content": "The day before Christmas Eve, Meyer Chetrit\u2019s interests in two holding companies were quietly auctioned off.\nThe highest bidder was an entity of\naggressive lender Maverick Real Estate Partners\n. The affiliate had foreclosed on Chetrit, won a $132 million judgment, and had set about getting paid by garnishing and auctioning Chetrit\u2019s assets.\nThe result is the latest in Chetrit\u2019s ongoing financial decline and legal battles and reveals the playbook of Maverick, which seemingly aims to take Chetrit\u2019s interests for itself on the cheap, under the auspices of an auction.\nThe Christmas week auction is the second in the ongoing legal saga between Maverick and Chetrit. At the\nfirst auction,\na representative for Maverick traded bids with Meyer Chetrit\u2019s brother Juda, who co-heads the Chetrit Organization.\nBut the second time around, it appears there were no bids traded because no one showed up. Court memos and affirmations from both Maverick\u2019s counsel and the city marshal responsible for the auction detailed the participants and spectators at the first auction, but their documents refer to no attendees, other than Maverick\u2019s affiliate, at the second.\nAt its own auction, Maverick bought Chetrit\u2019s interest in an LLC called CF Jamaica. The entity, through a series of other companies, controls a 16-story residential building at 152-01 and 150-13 88th Avenue in Jamaica.\nThe property is worth about $150 million but tied to about $285 million in debt, according to court documents filed by Chetrit\u2019s legal team. Chetrit allegedly received no income\nThe other entity Maverick won was called 90-100 Trinity Holder. The company is likely linked to the Chetrits\u2019 90 and 100 Trinity Place in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, two 10- and 15-story buildings. It\u2019s unclear the level of control or interest Meyer Chetrit personally has in the property.\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that these auctions should see few attendees. The auctions are little advertised. The city marshal\u2019s handbook requires that public auctions be advertised the day-of in a newspaper. There are no requirements that auctions be marketed online.\nAnd they are scheduled seemingly on the fly. Six days before the auction, a spokesperson for Fox Rothschild, the law firm representing Maverick and the host of the first auction, said no date had been set yet for another. The Department of Investigation, which oversees the city marshals, similarly said days before that it was unaware of any scheduled auctions in the case.\nMarshal Martin Bienstock, the city marshal hired by Maverick to run the ostensibly public auction, declined to answer questions about the value of the winning bid or whether anyone besides Maverick participated in the auction. Neither Maverick nor Matthew Schenker, a lawyer for the affiliate with Fox Rothschild, responded to a request for comment.\nChetrit had made a legal attempt to stop the auctions but had been turned down by a judge.\n",

        "content": "The owner of a long-struggling shopping center in Chicago\u2019s Clybourn Corridor is preparing to kick off a redevelopment that could eventually bring a sizable residential building to one of the North Side\u2019s busiest retail strips.\nDeerfield-based CRM Properties plans to begin demolition in the coming months at\nClybourn Place\n, a 3-acre shopping center at 1800 North Clybourn Avenue, CoStar\nreported\n. The initial phase would clear portions of the site to make way for roughly 43,900 square feet of new retail space, revamped parking and open areas designed to host community events.\nThe move follows a rough stretch for the center, which has lost several high-profile tenants in recent years, including the original\nGoose Island Beer\nbrewpub\n, Patagonia and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nCRM\nfirst outlined its broader vision for the property \u2014 dubbed the Willow Street District \u2014 in May 2024.\nAt the time, the firm said the site could ultimately support an apartment building of up to 500 units on the southwest corner of the property. That housing component remains conceptual. CRM principal Jeff Malk said the company\u2019s near-term focus is on demolition and reconfiguration of buildings along Clybourn and Sheffield avenues and Willow Street. Any residential phase would require a zoning change, and its timing and scope have not yet been determined.\nFor now, CRM is betting on retail. It has tapped Savills brokers Todd Siegel, Phil Golding and Kimberly Wiskup to lease the new space, which would represent a relatively rare infusion of large-format retail availability in Lincoln Park. Individual spaces could reach up to 9,500 square feet.\nCRM is pitching the project as a natural extension of the nearby Armitage Avenue shopping corridor, which has thrived in recent years just a few blocks east. The firm is emphasizing walkability paired with on-site parking, aiming to draw both neighborhood foot traffic and shoppers arriving by car.\nMost of the new retail would rise north of Willow Street, which currently splits the shopping center. The redevelopment will also preserve pieces of the site\u2019s industrial past, incorporating masonry towers that date back to a former William D. Gibson Company spring plant, later a Turtle Wax factory, before the property\u2019s conversion to retail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The campus will serve approximately 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students and have permanent faculty and staff.\nNews\nsurfaced last year\nthat Vanderbilt was\nlooking for a place to set up shop\nin San Francisco, reportedly\neyeing the 5M mixed-use project\nin South of Market. Ultimately, the school chose the California College of the Arts campus because it has housing for 1,000 students and is already configured for academic use, saving time and money that would\u2019ve been necessary to convert some of the downtown space they considered.\n\u201cWe looked at various different opportunities,\u201d Vanderbilt chancellor Daniel Diermeier told the Chronicle. \u201cWe looked downtown.

In 2024, the school\nspent $123 million\non building a campus in San Francisco and consolidating it with its original Oakland campus, the San Francisco Standard reported. Following the expansion, enrollment dropped significantly, leading to a $20 million budget deficit. Early last year, CCA received a $45 million donation lifeline, half of which came from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cUltimately, neither of these are enough to ensure CCA can continue to operate independently,\u201d Howse said of the funding injections.\nVanderbilt must receive regulatory approvals for its satellite campus before it begins operations.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Aimco shielded its record\n$520 million\nsale of a Brickell development site from roughly $5.5 million in state taxes and a county surtax usually levied for property sales.\nBy not recording a deed, the Denver-based firm sidestepped about $3.12 million in Florida documentary stamp taxes and $2.34 million in a Miami-Dade County surtax, both of which primarily fund affordable housing, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\nbased on calculations of the tax rates. The seller, which is the one on the hook for the taxes, pressed for doing the deal without a deed.\nThe publication was unable to reach Aimco, led by Wes Powell, for comment.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust that primarily buys and develops apartments announced in November its plan for a\nvoluntary dissolution\n, amid a slower multifamily market. Aimco has been selling off its assets over the past year and listed its Brickell assemblage in 2024 for about\n$650 million\n.\nLast month, Vlad Doronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group and Oak Row Equities, with offices in Miami and New York, bought the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive from Aimco. Mariposa Real Estate, tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, partnered on the purchase.\nThe buyers took out a $464.5 million loan for the purchase from Tyko Capital. The financing was recorded in Miami-Dade records, and the borrowers were the same entities that Aimco used to own the sites for years, but with Oak Row\u2019s Erik Rutter signing the loans on behalf of the borrowers. Rutter leads Oak Row with David Weitz.\nThis signifies that Aimco sold the properties through a transfer of the ownership interest in the limited liability companies it used to own the sites. The practice is legal and sporadically used, though the Brickell deal is the biggest known South Florida sale closed without recording a deed and paying state and county taxes.\nThe Brickell assemblage sale is the biggest urban land site deal in South Florida history, and likely in the state.\nOKO Group\nand\nOak Row\nplan a hotel and branded condos for the first phase of their project. As a whole, the site can be developed with multiple supertalls with more than 3 million square feet. For now, it has two income-producing properties.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The famed developer has been trying to sell the Hamptons estate with little luck for nearly two years.\nOne of the impediments to a sale has been the lack of a certificate of occupancy, needed for a resident to actually live there. East Hampton Village officials have accused Macklowe of illegal land clearing and unpermitted additions that jeopardized the surrounding wetlands. The ensuing drama created a need for an updated certificate of occupancy before somebody could live in the home.\nDouglas Elliman listing brokers Paul Brennan and Martha Gundersen claim there is a \u201cclear path\u201d towards\nresolving the dispute\nand picking up the certificate. The developer agreed to revegetate with low-lying plants and remove a patio. He\u2019ll also need to pay the fines he\u2019s racked up from the village.\nThat should open the door for a certificate of occupancy, though the timeline will be contingent on the cooperation of the weather to allow the revegetation work.\nOnce listed\nfor $38 million\n, the property\u2019s ask was dropped down to $32.5 million, or $5,909 per square foot, in the midst of the dispute.\nMacklowe paid\n$10.4 million\nfor the home in 2017, using it as a residence with his then-girlfriend, Patricia Landeau \u2014 now wife \u2014 during his\nnasty split from Linda Macklowe\n.\nThe 5,500-square-foot home features four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. Futterman Architects designed the home, which includes a waterfront gunite pool and is abutted by Georgica Pond.\nIt is just a stone\u2019s throw from the 9,000-square-foot home Macklowe shared with his ex-wife. That home was listed in 2019 for\n$21 million\n, but Linda ultimately decided to hang on to the pad.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "On his first day in office, Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed three housing-related executive orders.\nOne relaunched the Office to Protect Tenants, which was created by Mayor Bill de Blasio but\nhollowed out\nby the last administration. Another sought to speed up housing construction, while the other focused on opportunities to build housing on public land.\nLeila Bozorg, the newly-appointed deputy mayor of housing and planning, said the orders lay the groundwork for what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cI think the executive orders that we put out on day one of the administration really show that comprehensive approach that we want to take,\u201d she said during an interview this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be focused on continuing to build on our housing supply challenges, but also coupling that with important perspectives and tools to protect tenants.\u201d\nAs Mamdani\u2019s housing czar, Bozorg will play a major role in shaping the mayor\u2019s housing plan, building on her work with the previous administration while taking a more aggressive approach to tenant protections.\nBozorg most recently served as Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nexecutive director\nof housing, where she worked extensively on zoning changes under the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. She also served on the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission, which presented voters with four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, including three that created different avenues for project approvals. Before that, she served on the City Planning Commission and was chief of strategy and policy at nonprofit NYC Kids RISE.\nShe also previously was chief of staff to two former commissioners of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, as well as a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration.\nThe Real Deal\ncaught up with Bozorg this week to speak about the new role and the administration\u2019s early actions.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nWhat are your top priorities in this new role?\nI am really going to be focused on building off the foundation of work that I\u2019ve done in my career over the past 15 years to make sure that we are using every tool at our disposal to address our housing crisis, and in this administration, building new tools.\nWhat kind of new tools are you looking at?\nI\u2019m really interested in building off the work that HPD has been doing, not only to build 100 percent affordable housing but [to develop] new, mixed-income tools that allow us to build both market-rate and affordable housing. Especially given the mayor\u2019s ambitious goals to create 200,000 new affordable units, we\u2019re going to have to come up with new, mixed-income strategies to be able to scale to that level of affordable production. We\u2019ll also be looking to work closely with NYCHA, build[ing] on the work that they\u2019ve been doing through\nPACT\n, but also to reposition some of their campuses to do affordable\ninfills\nalong with building off the work at the\nPreservation Trust\n.\nWhat is your role in helping the mayor deliver on some of his key campaign promises, including the promise to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years?\nA huge part of my role right now is going to be helping to identify and appoint new members to the Rent Guidelines Board. It\u2019s ultimately going to be up to the board to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for a rent freeze. But we\u2019re confident that when you look at the various elements that the board has to take into consideration, they\u2019ll find that a rent freeze is appropriate, through the process of both looking at data, taking testimony and looking at the economic conditions that tenants are facing.\nIn addition, we really need to build out our preservation strategies supporting distressed buildings, including distressed rent-stabilized buildings. We want to be looking at different programs to help bring down operating costs. The issue of insurance costs going up is something we\u2019re looking closely at, and whether there\u2019s any public sector tools we can bring to the table to address those types of growing costs. And the mayor has also stated that he\u2019s interested in taking a look at our property tax system, which ultimately creates some of the kind of inequitable outcomes that have created distress in the rent-stabilized stock.\nWhen searching for rent board candidates, are you looking for people who are more amenable to a rent freeze? You said it\u2019s ultimately up to the board to decide, but the mayor\u2019s pledge wasn\u2019t qualified in that way during the campaign.\nThere\u2019s a number of requirements that board members have to meet to be qualified to be on the board. We\u2019ll be looking to make sure anyone that\u2019s appointed is qualified to analyze these issues comprehensively, as required by law.\nHow are you thinking about the role of the Office to Protect Tenants, especially in terms of taking over distressed buildings?\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of things that the office is focused on, not just on distressed properties or the case of bad landlords that need to be held more accountable, but also the types of services that need to be available to tenants and working better for tenants or the types of services that are often available but siloed across government.\nThe city actually [has] a lot of examples of intervening in distressed multifamily properties and helping facilitate preservation purchases. That\u2019s a huge chunk of work that HPD does every day, facilitating preservation transactions so that buildings can be on a better financial foundation and get rehab. The tools already exist, but we\u2019re one week in, and at the early stages of thinking about whether there are gaps in that toolbox that we need to develop for the distressed stock.\nAre you concerned that the housing regulation bills\nvetoed\nby Mayor Eric Adams might be revived by the City Council?\nI\u2019m really excited to be working with the new City Council and with Speaker Julie Menin to advance shared housing goals. And yes, we\u2019ve voiced some concerns about a number of the bills that were vetoed by the last administration, particularly when it comes to the impact that some of those bills may have on the cost of housing production, or how much we can be producing with the limited resources that we have. It remains to be seen whether the Council will override those vetoes, but I have full faith that we have a lot of shared goals and that we\u2019ll be able to work together to address the affordable housing challenge.\nThe last administration did not veto the Construction Justice Act, which established minimum wages for construction workers on certain projects. Do you have a sense of how that\u2019s going to affect the city\u2019s ability to impact city-financed housing going forward?\nIt\u2019s a\nbill\nwe support and look forward to working with the laborers and others to ensure that, as we\u2019re building, people are paid a livable and fair wage.\n(The Adams administration warned that this measure would be the costliest of the housing measures.)\nDo you expect landlords to participate in the\nRental Ripoff\nhearings?\nWe want to be hearing from everybody, including landlords, about the types of issues and conditions that tenants are facing, or maybe the types of unscrupulous fees that they\u2019re facing, but we also want to hear the experiences that landlords and property managers are faced with as well. For too long, we\u2019ve been a bit disconnected from real people\u2019s voices. We\u2019re really aiming to bring New Yorkers into the policy-making process very early on in the administration, so that we can hear from them directly as we\u2019re developing the housing plan and creating a baseline for new housing policy.\nThere are some people in the real estate industry who see the\nearly actions\nof the administration as anti-landlord. How do you think about balancing the push for more tenant protections while also encouraging development of housing by the private sector?\nWe really have to be able to do multiple things at once. We have to be aggressive in addressing our housing supply challenges. That\u2019s why two of the\nexecutive orders\nwere really focused on finding sites for more housing and speeding up the development process. This mayor very much recognizes that we have a housing shortage and wants to be incredibly aggressive on the development front, so we\u2019ll remain a pro-development administration. At the same time, yes, there\u2019s going to be a focus on ensuring we can do that while also protecting tenants. That\u2019s critical for a city like ours, where we have a 1.4 percent vacancy rate. It\u2019s incredibly hard to find housing, and that\u2019s created an uneven playing field for tenants across the whole city.\nWhat do you want to see happen at the Elizabeth Street Garden site, where the last administration abandoned plans for senior housing?\nWe\u2019ll have to take a close look at the\nactions\nthat the last administration made at the very end of the administration, and evaluate the kind of cost and benefit of trying to move forward on the site.\nDoes the city plan to step in or help other portfolios in similar situations as the\nPinnacle\nbuildings?\nWe have a history of supporting preservation of projects that are in physical and financial distress. A large part of HPD work focuses on repositioning properties that are facing both physical or financial distress. We have a number of tools, but we\u2019ll be evaluating case-by-case on what our options are to support buildings and the tenants that live in them.\n",

        "content": "Eric Adams is out of office, but allegations of corruption continue to dog his administration.\nFederal prosecutors indicted Tony Herbert on corruption charges, The City\nreported\n. Herbert allegedly demanded kickbacks from vendors in exchange for city contracts while the Adams associate served as a liaison between City Hall and NYCHA.\nProsecutors allege Herbert shook down a firm seeking a contract to perform security services at NYCHA developments. Herbert allegedly ghostwrote a letter to an unidentified aide to get the security firm pre-qualified as a minority-owned business. He allegedly took a $3,500 bribe from the security firm in 2024.\nLaw enforcement tapped on the security firm\u2019s owner to cooperate in their probe, leading to recorded conversations and saved messages. Texts even allegedly show Herbert communicating with Adams about the need for more security at NYCHA developments, without disclosing the alleged scheme, according to court filings.\nThe vendor did not land the contract.\nHerbert also allegedly took kickbacks from a funeral home director trying to get involved in subsidizing funeral services for low-income residents. Herbert appeared to receive a $6,000 check from the funeral home, referenced in a memo as \u201creferrals.\u201d\nAdditionally, Herbert allegedly defrauded the federal government out of a $20,000 Paycheck Protection Plan loan for a nonexistent bakery.\nIt all came to an end in September 2024, according to prosecutors, on the day the FBI and Department of Investigation seized the phones of multiple senior aides to Adams.\nHerbert \u201cvehemently denies wrongdoing,\u201d his attorney said on Tuesday following his arraignment. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the most serious charges.\nThe federal prosecutor\u2019s office involved in Herbert\u2019s indictment is the same one that launched a bribery and campaign finance case against Adams. The former mayor\u2019s indictment was ultimately\ndismissed\nby the Justice Department as he grew more cooperative with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, arguably costing Adams a second term.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Uncommon Developers\nis tweaking its plans for an apartment building in Hollywood.\nThe Chatsworth-based development firm has\nbeefed up\nits proposal for apartments at 7441 Sunset Boulevard, Urbanize Los Angeles reported.\nA new application filed with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning calls for the construction of a 15-story building with 143 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above parking for 143 vehicles and 3,585 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. That\u2019s more than double the height of the previously proposed building, which would have risen seven stories with 123 apartments above ground-floor commercial space and subterranean parking. The new\nplan\n, like the old one, calls for demolishing a commercial building to make way for the residences.\nThe Department of City Planning recently terminated Uncommon\u2019s entitlement application for the seven-story building, saying the developer wasn\u2019t making progress with the project. Uncommon reportedly was working on a larger project at the site instead. The new application utilizes\ndensity bonus\nincentives, which would allow construction larger than what zoning rules normally allow in exchange for designating 18 apartments for rent by very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, an individual\nmaking\n$53,000 or less annually qualifies as very-low-income, while a household of four must make less than $75,750.\nUncommon recently made a similar pivot in Beverly Grove. Last month, it abandoned its plans for a midrise building at 7959 Beverly Boulevard and instead\nfiled\na new application for a 15-story tower, Urbanize Los Angeles reported. The company has other developments in the works including an under-construction\n405-unit apartment complex in Van Nuys\nand a proposed 12-story apartment tower near the University of California, Los Angeles, campus in Westwood.\nUncommon\u2019s proposed Hollywood project would be built across the street from\nGreystar\n\u2019s new\nRae on Sunset\napartment building, which also features retail below 200 apartments.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Time Out Market is bowing out of Chicago\u2019s West Loop, closing its Fulton Market space less than six years after opening it as an early entrant in the city\u2019s upscale food hall boom.\nThe 50,000-square-foot Time Out Market Chicago at 916 West Fulton Street will shutter Jan. 23, the company confirmed in a statement released Thursday morning. Time Out CEO Michael Marlay cited uneven foot traffic tied to hybrid work patterns and rising operating costs as obstacles to profitability, even as Chicago\u2019s broader recovery has gained steam, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201c[Foot traffic] until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased \u2014 all of which prevents consistent profitability,\u201d Marlay said in the statement.\nThe closure affects more than a dozen local food operators, many of which run their only physical space or a key outpost inside the market. Some vendors had signed leases just months ago, highlighting the whiplash facing small operators that bet on\nFulton Market\u2019s\ncontinued momentum.\nThe building\u2019s owners are already lining up a second act. The building was purchased in 2023 for nearly $36 million by a venture of Luxembourg-based Lagfin, the holding company tied to the Italian billionaire family that owns Campari Group.\nLagfin\npartnered with Chicago developer\nR2\nto manage the food hall, and R2 will now help reposition or re-lease the space.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison told the outlet that ownership is exploring a broad range of options, from another food-and-beverage concept to experiential or flagship retail uses, and that discussions with potential users are already underway.\nTime Out Market opened in 2019, staking out a prime corner of Fulton Market as the district was cresting as Chicago\u2019s hottest mixed-use neighborhood. But the\npandemic-era shift\nin office usage and rising labor and operating costs have battered food halls nationwide. Chicago has already seen several retrenchments, particularly downtown.\nThe situation mirrors the shakeup at\nRevival Food Hall\nin the Loop. Revival announced its closure in July 2024, only for a new operator to step in within weeks and keep the space running under a different banner.\nTime Out Market still operates in 10 cities globally, though\nlocal outlets\nin Boston reported that market is also closing, suggesting broader pressure on the brand\u2019s U.S. portfolio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties is on a mission to\npurchase 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments\nat a bankruptcy auction.\nBut there\u2019s been a thorn in its side: the Mamdani administration, which has filed\nnumerous\nobjections\nto the auction and sale, generating paperwork and press.\nNow, Summit is trying to get the city off its back. In a declaration filed Wednesday, Summit CEO Zohar Levy outlined a plan to fix the bankrupt properties.\nSummit appears poised to be confirmed as the buyer in a Thursday morning bankruptcy hearing. If confirmed, it would foil attempts by the city and renters to find a more tenant-focused buyer. But the declaration also illustrates that New York\u2019s big landlords are living in a new reality, one where the mayor will personally make private transactions a political issue, and hope to extract concessions for tenants where it can.\nIn the declaration, Levy laid out a management structure and timeline to address housing code violations at the properties, seeming to reply directly to city filings arguing the company won\u2019t be able to fix up the properties.\nTenants and the city have cast Pinnacle, the owner who placed the buildings in bankruptcy, as a slumlord, given the portfolio\u2019s nearly 7,000 housing code violations.\nBut Levy says violations in the portfolio appear to be incredibly concentrated. Only 420 of the 5,200 units in the portfolio have documented violations, he wrote, representing just 8% of units.\nLevy outlined a plan to divide the violation-ridden buildings between two management companies. Resources will be prioritized for the Brooklyn portion of the portfolio, which comprises less than half the units but more than 60 percent of the violations.\nSummit plans to spend $30 million over five years on capital expenditures for the portfolio, with $10 million required in the first year to fix existing violations and a maintenance backlog. That works out to about $1,940 per unit in the first year and $5,824 over five years.\nSome of the open violations are, however, immediately hazardous, including vermin infestations and lead paint violations.\nLevy said Summit plans to address half the violations in the first 60 days and the remaining in 180 days. About 13 percent of violations are related to vermin infestations and 20 percent are related to paint and plaster. Others relate to general repairs, lead paint and water.\nAbout 15 percent of the violations are in apartments Pinnacle says it hasn\u2019t been able to access. Levy said Summit is prepared to work with the city to get access to the units.\nThe filing also revealed that Flagstar Bank, the biggest creditor in the bankruptcy, has agreed to finance up to 75 percent of Summit\u2019s $451.3 million bid. The arrangement will lower the mortgage debt on the portfolio by $275 million and lower the interest rate.\nThe mayor\u2019s office, which has objected to the sale in part because of the lack of plan from Summit, declined to comment on the declaration.\nBut the Union of Pinnacle Tenants, representing tenants at the properties, said Summit is trying to diminish the scale of neglect across the portfolio. The city\u2019s housing arm hasn\u2019t been able to complete roof-to-cellar inspections of every unit up for sale, and Summit would be required by law to address the most serious violations within 24 hours, the union said.\nSummit\u2019s existing portfolio already contains more than 5,000 open violations and has earned it a place on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlord\u201d list, tenants said.\n\u201cThe violations recorded are almost certainly an undercount,\u201d the union said of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio in a statement. \u201cThe judge should look at [Summit\u2019s] documented history of neglect, not unenforceable promises.\u201d\nThe city along with tenants have asked the judge to reject the sale. They\u2019ve raised concerns about Summit\u2019s stewardship, financial ability to invest in the properties at the sale price, and also suggested more time would allow for a tenant-focused buyer to bid.\nFlagstar Bank, to whom the Pinnacle portfolio owes $564 million, also objected to that formally in a separate declaration. The city\u2019s argument that the sale price of about $88,000 per unit is too high, the bank said, is antithetical to the goals of the bankruptcy process.\n\u201cIt is also not the approach of a party that believes, and is ready to invest, in the properties,\u201d Flagstar wrote. \u201cIn the end, it appears that the City\u2019s real objective is to scuttle the Sale Transaction so that it has more time to come up with a competing bid for significantly less money.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Isaac Hera is pushing ahead with his planned redevelopment of\nthe former Watson Hotel\n.\nBarings provided Hera\u2019s Yellowstone Real Estate Investments with a $326 million construction loan for the hotel-to-residential conversion of 440 West 57th Street, according to property records. The financing will fund the redevelopment and expansion of the Hell\u2019s Kitchen property, which is slated to deliver 316 apartments spread across two towers.\nYellowstone purchased the leasehold interest at the Watson along with the existing mortgage from HSBC\nin 2021 for $175 million\n, after Richard Born and Ira Drukier\u2019s\nBD Hotels defaulted\non the debt the year before.\nBut the project has been slow to move forward. During the pandemic, the 600-key Watson shuttered to traditional guests and was instead used by the city as a migrant shelter amid an influx of asylum seekers. Mayor Eric Adams said last year that the shelter would close by the start of the summer, clearing the way for redevelopment.\nYellowstone filed updated plans with the Department of Buildings this summer, calling for two residential towers and a parking garage in the cellar. Amenities will include an entertainment lounge, gaming room, pet playroom, fitness center and indoor swimming pool. The hotel\u2019s existing rooftop outdoor pool will remain as part of the redevelopment, per the filing.\nThe Watson conversion is the latest in a growing list of Manhattan repositionings by Hera, whose firm has leaned into adaptive reuse as office and hotel distress has mounted. Yellowstone is also pursuing a 422-unit office-to-residential conversion at 1730 Broadway, a Midtown West building it bought from Blackstone last year for $185.9 million.\nHera declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Michael Swerdlow wants rival developer Don Peebles jailed over a four-year-old unpaid $800,000 judgment.\nIn a Jan. 7 motion, an entity managed by Swerdlow, who leads Coconut Grove-based Swerdlow Group, wants Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull to find\nPeebles\nof criminal contempt outside the courtroom. Peebles should be \u201cincarcerated\u201d if Rebull concludes the founder of Miami Beach-based The Peebles Corporation violated a post-judgment court order issued in May, Swerdlow\u2019s motion states.\nThe $800,000 represents legal fees and costs Swerdlow won against Peebles in 2022 tied to their long-running legal battle over a land deal for in Overtown. Swerdlow and his partners SJM and Alben Duffie bought the 3.4-acre property at 249 Northwest Sixth Street for\n$10 million\nin 2020. The same year, two\nPeebles entities\nsued Swerdlow, his affiliate and Duffie for allegedly sabotaging Peebles\u2019 involvement in the land deal.\nFour years later, the joint venture completed Block 55 at Sawyer\u2019s Walk, a mixed-use center featuring 578 senior affordable housing apartments and a 251,000-square-foot office and retail center anchored by Target and Aldi stores.\nMichael Higer, an attorney representing Peebles and two of his entities, dismissed the allegations in Swerdlow\u2019s recent motion. \u201cWe believe it is completely frivolous,\u201d Higer said.\nSwerdlow and his legal team declined comment. In a 2024 interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, the developer blasted Peebles\u2019 lawsuit. \u201c[The allegations] were so ridiculous that the judge threw out every one of them on summary judgment,\u201d\nhe said\nat the time. \u201cNobody thought [Peebles] had a chance.\u201d\nPeebles dissolved the two entities that owe the $800,000 judgment in August, state corporate records show. In doing so, he circumvented Rebull\u2019s May order placing the two entities under control of a receiver, and blocking him from taking any actions on behalf of the entities without court approval, Swerdlow\u2019s motion alleges.\nSwerdlow\u2019s request to have Peebles arraigned for criminal contempt carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Peebles\u2019 alleged end\u2011run around the receivership is the type of conduct that justifies criminal contempt sanctions to \u201cvindicate the authority and dignity of the court,\u201d Swerdlow\u2019s motion asserts.\nPeebles is known for getting into legal fights over government-owned sites he bids on. In January of last year, he and partner Victor MacFarlane sued the City of Los Angeles for allegedly unlawfully terminating their contract to build the\n$1.6 billion\nAngels Landing project Downtown. The project was billed as among the largest African-American-led developments in the city\u2019s history.\nSwerdlow is among the most active developers of government-owned sites in Miami-Dade County. His next big swing is the\n$3 billion Little River District\n, a 64-acre redevelopment that would blanket a nearly mile-long stretch between Miami neighborhoods Little River and Little Haiti. The plan, backed by a 99-year ground lease with Miami-Dade County, envisions roughly 5,700 units on a site assembled from county-owned land and parcels controlled by AJ Capital Partners.\nRoughly 314 apartments would be reserved for residents displaced from four public housing projects, while nearly 3,700 units would be set aside for households earning between 60 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. The first phase, recently cleared by federal housing officials, calls for two new buildings with 600 apartments, while future phases would add a Home Depot, a BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, a supermarket and a new Tri-Rail station.",

The buyer borrowed $28.9 million from Israel Discount Bank of New York for the deal.\nCompleted in 2019, the 117,300-square-foot Edison consists of a three-story building and a one-story building on a 12.6-acre site, Vizzda records show. It last traded for $12.2 million in 2017, according to property records.\nEdison roughly 87 percent occupied, said Alejandro Velez, of Midtown Capital.\nTenants include insurance broker Lockton, MyHousingSearch and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel.\nMidtown Capital plans to hold the asset and eventually pursue an apartment project on this site and its adjacent property. Midtown also owns the nearly 145,000-square-foot Pembroke Pointe office building 880 Southwest 145th Avenue, immediately north of Edison.\nPembroke Pointe is fully leased, according to Velez. Tenants include Keller Williams Realty Partners SW.\nThe Edison and Pembroke Pointe sites give Midtown Capital a combined 23.6 acres of land.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Midtown Capital would add the apartment buildings on the parking lots and keep the offices, or if it would pursue a total redevelopment.\nMidtown is ramping up its South Florida development activity. This month, it scored an\n$84 million\nconstruction loan to complete its 252-unit Astor Park Flagler Village apartment project with a pair of 12-story buildings in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village neighborhood. Construction completion is expected this summer.\nIn Plantation, Midtown also plans to add a\n300-unit apartment project\nwith some affordable housing on the parking lot of the Plantation Pointe office park. The site is at\u00a0 7510 West Sunrise Boulevard.\nDevelopers have seized upon\nsuburban office complexes\nin South Florida with plans for redevelopment, either adding apartments on the parking lots or replacing existing buildings. In Boca Raton, Pebb Enterprises and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are renovating two of the existing office buildings at the Office Depot headquarters campus. The pair is partnering with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group to replace the third building with an\neight-story, 500-unit apartment project\n. The campus has been rechristened The Eclipse.\nConversions of existing office buildings into residential are rare in South Florida. The only known such project is Keystone Development + Investment\u2019s conversion of the properties at 9400 and 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in Kendall\u2019s Dadeland area into\n212 apartments\n.\n",

        "content": "The head of one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable luxury brokerages is putting his own money into the brand, making an equity investment in Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates as the firm looks to double down on its local identity amid industry consolidation.\nKeith Conlon, the firm\u2019s president and CEO, acquired an ownership stake in the brokerage, marking an unusual move for a company owned by HomeServices of America, the real estate arm of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the financial terms were not disclosed.\nConlon said in a statement on Monday that the investment formalizes a long-term commitment to the\nfirm\nand positions it to retain top talent at a time when mergers, acquisitions and national rollups are reshaping the brokerage landscape.\nFounded in 1985 by Allie Beth Allman, the firm was acquired in 2015 by HomeServices, but has continued to operate under its original name and leadership. Allman stepped down as CEO in 2020 and tapped\nConlon\n, who joined the company in 2008, as her successor.\n\u201cThis is the first transaction of its kind for HomeServices,\u201d Conlon said, describing the deal as a chance to reintroduce a more \u201cgrassroots\u201d ownership mentality. He framed the move as a matter of both retention and recruiting, aimed at agents who want the feel of a locally owned shop without giving up the scale and support of a national platform.\nAllman praised the investment as a safeguard for the firm\u2019s legacy. In the statement, she said Conlon\u2019s buy-in ensures the brokerage\u2019s local roots remain intact, calling the move a natural extension of the succession plan she put in place five years ago.\nThe brokerage has thrived in recent years alongside North Texas\u2019 population boom and corporate migration wave. In 2024,\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\nclosed nearly $4 billion in residential sales volume, driven by 2,674 transactions. According to the publication, the firm ranked as the fourth-largest brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth by sales volume, with 416 licensed agents that year.\nThe firm\u2019s name regularly appears on some of the region\u2019s priciest listings, including a University Park home that became Texas\u2019 most expensive publicly listed residential sale in 2025, asking $35 million. Its portfolio also includes marquee properties like the Knox Hotel &amp; Residences, the Mount Vernon estate on White Rock Lake and the\nRachofsky House\nin North Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal closed Jan. 8, with no price disclosed, the Dallas Business Journal first\nreported\n. The property had been marketed for $43.5 million.\nThe ranch sits about 50 miles west of\nFort Worth\nand roughly 18 miles outside\nWeatherford\n, which brands itself as the cutting horse capital of the world. TR9 is known nationally for its top-tier equestrian infrastructure and for housing National Cutting Horse Association Hall of Fame horses including Quintan Blue and Watch Me Whip, according to the publication. Teton Ridge ran a breeding and performance program out of the property during its ownership.\nTeton Ridge held the ranch for about four years and significantly expanded it, Icon Global associate broker\nDon Bell\ntold the outlet. The company grew the property from 618 acres to 860 acres, gutted older structures and built new facilities designed to handle multiple horse disciplines under one roof.\nThe\nranch\nincludes several indoor and outdoor performance arenas, cattle-handling systems, extensive barns and conditioning areas, along with spectator viewing spaces. Bell called it the premier horse training facility in Parker County, noting that it\u2019s rare for one property to accommodate cutting, reining and cow horse training due to differing arena and ground requirements.\nThe buyers operate Theorem Ranch, with holdings in Montana and a vineyard in Napa Valley. In August, the Itkins made headlines in the Western performance world by purchasing a $23 million cutting horse sire, Stevie Rey Von. Jason Itkin is a partner at Houston law firm Arnold &amp; Itkin, while Kisha Itkin has taken a visible role in shaping their ranching ventures.\nIn a social media post announcing the acquisition, Kisha Itkin said the couple plans to \u201cmaximize this ranch\u2019s potential\u201d and position it as a platform to help grow Western performance sports.\nBell said he initially expected the land would need to be sold off in tracts given the cost to operate a facility of that scale. Instead, the Itkins emerged as a rare buyer whose resources matched their ambition. Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz echoed that sentiment, pointing to a \u201cpinhole\u201d market for properties of this caliber.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York is taking a crack at reforming its environmental review process.\nGov. Kathy Hochul wants the state to change what projects are subject to the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nAs is often the case with the\nState of the State addresses\n, Tuesday\u2019s was light on details about this proposal. We\u2019ll probably have to wait until next week, when the governor is expected to roll out her executive budget proposals, to get into the weeds on what she envisions. (Unless someone wants to leak some bill language?)\nA spokesperson for the governor indicated that the proposal seeks to exempt a majority of housing projects from environmental review, confirming a Wall Street Journal report from Monday night.\nThat\u2019s more in line with Sen. Rachel May\u2019s bill, dubbed the Sustainable Affordable Housing and Sprawl Prevention Act and first introduced in 2021, which would exempt affordable housing projects with fewer than 1,000 units from SEQRA. \u201cAffordable,\u201d under the measure, would be defined by the state\u2019s housing regulator.\nHochul\u2019s proposal goes further, seemingly including market-rate housing and certain infrastructure projects.\nEnvironmental review reform has long been on the list of Yimby asks in New York. In the past two years, that list has gotten shorter, as the residential floor-area-ratio cap, parking requirements, member deference, accessory dwelling units, the 50 percent test for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and other policies have been crossed off the list (some with asterisks indicating more change is needed).\nHochul\u2019s environmental review reform push comes\nafter\nCalifornia\nexempted\ninfill housing from its state environmental review process. The Senate approved May\u2019s bill last year, but the Assembly didn\u2019t follow suit. Whether Hochul can get the legislature on board with reform this year remains to be seen.\nNew York\u2019s recent attempt to follow California\u2019s lead on another Yimby policy, a version of builder\u2019s remedy,\nfailed\nin 2023. Hochul hasn\u2019t revived the proposal, sticking instead with an opt-in\ncarrot-over-stick\napproach that ties state funding to localities passing pro-housing policies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDid the Verizon outage affect your ability to work on Wednesday? Disrupt any deals? Send a note to/commiserate with me at\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\nvetoed\na bill that would have made it easier for localities to import woodchucks from other states as part of Groundhog Day celebrations, citing risk of introducing new strains of rabies,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The veto means Milltown\u2019s Groundhog Day celebration will once again be without a main attraction.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 More than 10,000 Verizon customers in New York City lost cellphone service as the company experienced a nationwide outage,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cWe are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers,\u201d the company posted on social media. \u201cOur engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly.\u201d\n\u2014 City Council Speaker Julie Menin plans to tap Council member Nantasha Williams as deputy speaker and Council Member Shaun Abreu as majority leader,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\n\u2014 ICYMI, Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s policy agenda this year includes a proposal to scrap an outdated state law that bars dancing in restaurants.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$5.8 million\nfor a 2,800-square-foot condominium unit at 171 West 57th Street in the Plaza District. Alexander Glibbery with We R New York\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor a development site at 75-83 Nassau Street in the Financial District. Lexin Capital sold the land to Montgomery Street Partners.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23.5 million\nfor an 8,159-square-foot townhouse at 146 Waverly Place in the West Village. The Hudson Advisory Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 99,411-square-foot, 16-story mixed-use project at 918 Atlantic Avenue in Prospect Heights. Christopher Fogarty of Fogarty Finger filed the permit on behalf of Elie Parente of EMP Capital Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A Manhattan judge has hit pause on a\nUCC sale\ntied to Worldwide Plaza in a high-stakes legal brawl among three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players.\nIn an order filed Wednesday, the judge temporarily stopped the foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue, which Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development had scheduled for January 15. The decision postpones the auction until January 29 and keeps the current ownership structure in place for now.\nThe ruling came after landlords SL Green and RXR sued to block the sale, arguing it was a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown office complex without a fair, competitive process. The firms claim the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Barnett.\nExtell has\npushed back hard\nagainst the allegations, calling RXR and SL Green\u2019s lawsuit meritless and accusing the two developers of trying to derail a sale they have known about for months. Barnett\u2019s camp argued in a legal filing that the mezzanine lender is within its rights to foreclose after a default and that the auction was properly noticed and structured.\nThe judge directed Barnett to produce further documentation on whether the planned auction is commercially reasonable as the court weighs whether the foreclosure may proceed. Barnett must show that the auction terms comply with the Uniform Commercial Code and are not designed to chill bidding, according to the ruling. Barnett has until January 23 to respond to nine questions Judge Andrea Masley raised about the auction.\n\u201cWe believe the process taken by the mezz lender was improper and are gratified that the judge blocked the sale and ordered the mezz lender to address our concerns,\u201d said Stephen B. Meister, a lawyer for SL Green.\nWorldwide Plaza, a 1.8 million-square-foot office complex near Columbus Circle, has been a prime example of the office market\u2019s continued distress. Control of the mezzanine debt would give the winning bidder significant leverage over the property\u2019s future.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of senior mezzanine debt in 2017 that was later transferred to Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group. Extell apparently bought the loan last year.\nThe property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\nthat\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. The landlords defaulted on both senior and mezzanine debt in July, per public filings.\nRXR declined to comment. An Extell spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis article has been updated with a quote from Stephen B. Meister, a lawyer for SL Green.\n",

Two anonymous sources familiar with the deal said Griffin is a partner on the purchase.\nCitadel didn\u2019t return the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nLed by Andy Gloor, Sterling Bay completed the 10-story\n545Wyn\nin 2021, property records show. It spans nearly 500,000 square feet. The firm hit distress in the past year with a\nfailed Chicago megaproject called Lincoln Yards\nand has been selling off portions of that assemblage as well as other properties in Chicago and\nDallas\n.\nSterling Bay paid\n$18.9 million\nfor the development site in 2019. The seller in that trade was an entity tied to Srebnick.\nGriffin, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $51.4 billion, moved his Citadel and market maker firm Citadel Securities from Chicago to Miami in 2022. He\u2019s been steadily amassing properties in the Magic City, paying a record\n$363 million\nfor a 2.5-acre bayfront lot in Miami\u2019s Brickell, where Griffin plans to build a Citadel and Citadel Securities headquarters supertall. Griffin is partnering with New York-based Related Companies on the tower, which will include a hotel.\nCitadel and Citadel Securities are temporarily\nleasing space\nat 830 Brickell and the Southeast Financial Center in downtown Miami.\nAcross the street from the development site, Griffin owns a small apartment building and vacant lot at 1250 and 1260 Brickell Bay Drive, paying\n$20 million\nfor the properties in 2022.\nGoldman was founded in 1968 by the late Tony Goldman, a pioneer in redeveloping Wynwood. Tony Goldman\u2019s niche was spotting and breathing new life into long-overlooked neighborhoods. He first seized on New York\u2019s SoHo and then on Miami Beach\u2019s Art Deco district, before moving onto Wynwood.

        "content": "Two Roads Development was ordered to restore the waterfront condo building in Miami\u2019s\nEdgewater\nat the center of an epic lawsuit that has dragged on for years.\nThe ruling marks the latest blow to the developer. It means\nTwo Roads\n, a Miami and West Palm Beach-based firm led by Taylor Collins and Reid Boren, will have to return the Biscayne 21 building to a habitable state, including repairs and restoring utilities such as air conditioning, water and electricity.\nMiami-Dade Judge Thomas Rebull ruled in favor of a group of holdout condo owners who sued the developer and the developer-controlled condo association in 2023. The previous year, Two Roads\npaid about $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront condo building, which was constructed in 1964.\nThe developer-controlled condo association was found to have illegally amended the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nThe case nearly made its way to\nFlorida\u2019s highest court\n, after an appeals court sided with the holdouts, affirming that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination. Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined last year to consider a motion for rehearing, effectively ending Two Roads\u2019 options to appeal.\nThe most recent court order, entered on Monday, requires that TRD Biscayne, the Two Roads entity:\nTake all steps to restore the condo association and have it comply with the previous condo declaration, including undoing the condo termination, and reinstate the deeds/condo folios to the individual owners.\nWithin 30 days, file a report detailing obstacles to reinstating the association.\nPrevent the developer from seeking zoning approvals or demolition permits.\nTurn the utilities back on and repair and maintain the condo building, including its common elements, to the condition they were in when the lawsuit was filed in May 2023 at the developer\u2019s expense.\nWithin 45 days, hold an annual meeting where it will have to provide a report to the unit owners regarding the building\u2019s status. The developer-controlled condo association will also have to provide the court with a report every 45 days.\nTwo Roads said in a statement that it \u201canticipated\u201d the court order and that it will comply with all court orders.\n\u201cThe building remains vacant and non-habitable, and any future reconstruction would require professional review and owner approval under the declaration. We will strictly follow Florida laws in this matter,\u201d the statement reads.\nJeffrey Lam, an attorney for the eight holdout owners, said that it\u2019s his understanding the building is still structurally sound. \u201cThe ultimate goal is that we get our clients back to their homes,\u201d Lam said.\nGlen Waldman, also representing the holdout owners, expects the developer\u2019s cost to repair the building is \u201cvery substantial\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s doable.\u201d\n\u201cThis is where a number of our clients wanted to live out the rest of their lives,\u201d Waldman added.\nLam and Waldman said they plan to file an amended complaint that adds parties and claims to the litigation, including the developer\u2019s lenders, principals and former board members.\nTwo Roads\u2019 entity financed the 2022 bulk purchase with a $45 million mezzanine loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC, the asset management affiliate of Fisher Brothers, and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK.\nTwo Roads has been on the hook for mounting interest, in the millions of dollars, on loans tied to the 2022 acquisition.\u00a0Two Roads\nlaunched sales\nof the first of three planned Edition towers, a 55-story, 185-unit tower, with unit prices starting at $1.7 million, months after the 2022 deal. Holdout owners Angelica Avila, Nicolas Bello, Maria Beatriz Gutierrez, Franah Vazir-Marino, Murphy, George Garcia, and two couples, Lazaro Fraga and Jacqueline S. Fraga, and Jeffrey Ulman and Shari Ulman, sued the following year.\n",

Details around the deal, including price, were not disclosed. The property was last appraised in 2021 at $1.8 billion and\nincludes\n1.2 million square feet of studio space, Urbanize Los Angeles reported.\nThe method of acquisition on Goldman\u2019s end is still being determined by both sides. Parties are reportedly discussing handing over the deed to Radford Studio Center, part of a process to voluntarily surrender the property to lenders to have the debt forgiven and to avoid long legal foreclosure proceedings, according to Bloomberg, citing a source close to the matter.\nRadford Studio Center\u2019s revenue covered approximately 21 percent of the cost of servicing its debt as of June 30. Hackman hadn\u2019t made payments on the loan since it matured in June while it negotiated with Goldman, the originator of the commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. Radford Studio Center was 63 percent occupied as of June 30; leases on 36 percent of its space are scheduled to expire by this August.\nHackman\u2019s return of the property comes after months of negotiations to modify its loan there.\n\u201cWe are continuing to work with the Radford lenders on a path forward for this asset,\u201d Hackman Capital told Bloomberg on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a challenging time for all suppliers and independent studio owners and operators in the U.S.\u201d\nThe studio market in Los Angeles has been bruised by years of pandemic shutdowns, the 2023 writer and actor union strikes and the\nconsolidation of studios\n.

Since California doubled film and tax credits last year, the industry has seen signs of a possible production comeback, including a \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel and \u201cBaywatch\u201d series reboot taking advantage of the incentives. In the past, Radford Studio Center hosted productions such as \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\nHackman remains the world\u2019s largest independent\nowner of studio properties\n. Its holdings include 19 facilities with 145 active sound stages and 60 stages in development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Blue Moon Capital Partners rode a Northbrook senior housing property, well, to the moon.\nThe Boston-based firm, led by co-founders\nSusan Barlow and Kathryn Sweeney\n, cashed out of a prime slice of Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs, selling a Northbrook assisted living and memory care complex for a healthy premium. New York-based private equity firm StepStone Group paid $144 million for the facility, called North Shore Place, public records show.\nStepStone bought the property at a 32 percent markup from Blue Moon\u2019s 2017 purchase price of nearly $110 million, public records show. StepStone\u2019s acquisition was structured as a nearly $58 million purchase of the real estate, with the remainder allocated toward furniture, fixtures and equipment for the property\u2019s operations. The buyer used a nearly $94 million Freddie Mac loan arranged by CBRE to fund its acquisition, public records show.\nNorth Shore Place, at 1000 Sunset Ridge Road, sits at the nexus of some of the wealthiest communities along suburban Chicago\u2019s North Shore. When Blue Moon acquired the property over eight years ago, it included 156 units \u2014116 for assisted living and 40 for memory care \u2014 and was already fully occupied with a waiting list. At the time, brokers touted the property as a \u201ctrifecta\u201d for investors due to its luxury design, high-barrier-to-entry location, and expansion potential on excess land.\nBlue Moon and StepStone didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nThe hefty sale price comes as the\nsenior housing market\nnavigates a\ncomplex recovery\n. While independent living has recently flexed more pricing power than assisted living and memory care \u2014 sectors where operators have had to use discounts to maintain occupancy, according to industry publication Senior Housing News \u2014 top-tier properties in supply constrained markets remain commanding.\nWith all styles of senior housing,\nconstruction pipelines\nare thinning and average build cycles stretch to nearly 29 months, according to industry analytics firm NIC. That means new supply is struggling to keep pace with the demographic tidal wave of baby boomers. Such scarcity has kept occupancy rising for 17 consecutive quarters as of late 2025, handing leverage back to owners of stabilized, high-quality facilities, NIC found.\nFor StepStone, the acquisition represents a bet on that long-term imbalance between demand and inventory. For Blue Moon, it\u2019s a lucrative exit that underscores the robust appetite for institutional-grade senior housing, even as the broader commercial real estate market works to regain its footing.\n",

        "content": "Marcel Arsenault landed a financially troubled Chicago office deal with a bumpy entrance into the market and a rough loss for its billionaire seller and lender.\nLouisville, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions, led by Arsenault and known for buying distressed commercial property, acquired the 35-story Magnificent Mile tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue for $132.5 million, the company said Wednesday.\nThat price tag represents a financial bath for the seller, real estate and casino tycoon\nNeil Bluhm\u2019s\nfirm Walton Street Capital. His Chicago-based firm paid roughly $360 million for the 748,000-square-foot tower in 2017, though that deal also included a retail space leased to Apple that was\nsold for $79 million\nin 2019.\nSubtracting the retail sale price, the sale to real Capital marks a value drop of nearly 53 percent, wiping out about $148 million in equity.\nIt also appears to be a short sale. The deal closed well below the $160 million mortgage that ING Capital issued on the property in 2019, leaving the lender to swallow a roughly $27.5 million loss \u2014 a scenario that has become increasingly common as\nborrowers hand back keys\nto their lenders or negotiate exits from underwater offices.\nBut ING may have the chance to make up some of that with more interest payments: Real Capital also obtained some seller financing from ING and co-lenders to fund part of the deal, though the firm\u2019s acquisitions chief Adam Abeln declined to discuss further details of the debt stack with\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cNow, we have the capabilities to close for cash and all these deals, but if we can get financing, it really helps the returns,\u201d Abeln said.\nReal Capital has been circling Chicago\u2019s distressed office market armed with a reported $3.5 billion war chest for bargain-hunting. It previously zeroed in on the 40-story tower at\n190 South LaSalle Street\nbefore backing out and pivoting to the Mag Mile deal.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it just didn\u2019t fit our strategy,\u201d Abeln said of 190 South LaSalle, while also mentioning the difficulty of getting financing for Chicago office deals. Real Capital is also preparing to buy a suburban Chicago office building, though Abeln declined to specify which one at this point. The firm is open to more acquisitions in Chicagoland, though, he said.\nThe deal at 401 North Michigan becomes the latest data point in a grim sequence for Michigan Avenue offices, where valuations are in freefall and institutional owners are throwing in the towel.\nDown the street, a\nBlackstone debt vehicle seized\nthe 517,000-square-foot building at 444 North Michigan in April, after Golub &amp; Co. and partner CIM Group defaulted on a $95 million loan.\nThe pain radiates north, too: in December, a joint venture between\nGolub and Abu Dhabi-based BlueFive Capital\nsaw their loan on 625 North Michigan Avenue sent to special servicing. They joined a similar fate as the former lender for the neighboring\n500 North Michigan Avenue\n, which sold last year for just $5.1 million. That followed a previous owner\u2019s $80 million loan default, giving the 500 North Michigan\u2019s new landlord, Commonwealth Development Partners, a chance to turn it into housing.\nWith 401 North Michigan now trading at a fraction of its replacement cost, it sets a brutal comparable for those nearby landlords still clinging to 2019 valuations.\nThe deal caps a tumultuous period for the property. Walton Street had been hunting for an exit for months. Late last year, the\nSaudi Arabia-backed Olayan Group\nwas in advanced talks to acquire the tower, but that deal\nfell apart\n, forcing Bluhm\u2019s firm to re-list the asset in a market that still hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the pandemic.\nFor Bluhm, the sale is another painful mark on his Chicago ledger. His other marquee asset, the\n900 North Michigan Avenue skyscraper\n, recently required a $56 million equity injection from his other firm, JMB Realty, to secure a refinancing deal as valuations plummeted.\nDespite the financial carnage, 401 North Michigan remains a trophy asset on paper. It is 87 percent leased to tenants including the American Dental Association and BDT &amp; MSD Partners, well above the downtown Chicago average of more than 25 percent vacancy. Real Capital touted the $17 million in recent renovations and the \u201cflight to quality\u201d trends it hopes to capitalize on.\nJLL\u2019s Bruce Miller, Jaime Fink, and John Mason represented Walton Street in the transaction.\nWalton Street\u2019s co-founder\nJeffrey Quicksilver\nand his wife Ashley also made real estate headlines late last year when they sold their lakefront Winnetka estate for $34.5 million, the largest resale of a single-family home in Illinois history. The couple downsized into a lakefront Kenilworth mansion they bought for $14.5 million, a record for that North Shore suburb.\n",

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the financial terms were not disclosed.\nConlon said in a statement on Monday that the investment formalizes a long-term commitment to the\nfirm\nand positions it to retain top talent at a time when mergers, acquisitions and national rollups are reshaping the brokerage landscape.\nFounded in 1985 by Allie Beth Allman, the firm was acquired in 2015 by HomeServices, but has continued to operate under its original name and leadership. Allman stepped down as CEO in 2020 and tapped\nConlon\n, who joined the company in 2008, as her successor.\n\u201cThis is the first transaction of its kind for HomeServices,\u201d Conlon said, describing the deal as a chance to reintroduce a more \u201cgrassroots\u201d ownership mentality. He framed the move as a matter of both retention and recruiting, aimed at agents who want the feel of a locally owned shop without giving up the scale and support of a national platform.\nAllman praised the investment as a safeguard for the firm\u2019s legacy. In the statement, she said Conlon\u2019s buy-in ensures the brokerage\u2019s local roots remain intact, calling the move a natural extension of the succession plan she put in place five years ago.\nThe brokerage has thrived in recent years alongside North Texas\u2019 population boom and corporate migration wave. In 2024,\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\nclosed nearly $4 billion in residential sales volume, driven by 2,674 transactions. According to the publication, the firm ranked as the fourth-largest brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth by sales volume, with 416 licensed agents that year.\nThe firm\u2019s name regularly appears on some of the region\u2019s priciest listings, including a University Park home that became Texas\u2019 most expensive publicly listed residential sale in 2025, asking $35 million. Its portfolio also includes marquee properties like the Knox Hotel &amp; Residences, the Mount Vernon estate on White Rock Lake and the\nRachofsky House\nin North Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

And, in a\ncity notorious for its sprawl\n, a centrally located home gains a certain \u201callure,\u201d she said.\nThe average Houston luxury home sold in 52 days last fall,\nhalf the time it took for the average Austin luxury home to sell\n, according to Redfin.\nWhile it\u2019s not a record-breaking deal, the Chevy Chase home outranks some of the top homes sold in the last year. Seven of the\ntop 10 most expensive homes sold in Houston in 2025\nasked less than $13 million.\nThat means the home has a good shot at making the top five sales of 2026 \u2014 unless somebody buys the\ncastle asking $60 millon at 107 Timberwilde Lane\n.\n",

        "content": "Landlords and the state comptroller don\u2019t see eye to eye on the city\u2019s $1.2 billion rental voucher system.\nLandlords say voucher placements are often denied because of small infractions like a\ncracked outlet plate\nor a window guard\nmissing one screw\n.\nYet a comptroller\u2019s audit last week warned that vouchers are being\napproved\nfor apartments with \u201cserious hazards\u201d like a defective window guard and roach infestations.\nBoth sides are correct, but the comptroller needs a reality check.\nIn a program this large, some inspectors will be human and others will be hard-asses. The humans approve tenant placements in units with violations. The hard-asses reject apartments for technical reasons, leaving desperate families in the shelter system and landlords furious.\nThe audit noted that some voucher users end up switching apartments because their first one has problems. This costs the city money. But it would cost a lot more \u2014 and hurt families \u2014 to reduce transfers by disqualifying more apartments.\nRule of thumb: Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. (In\nthis column\n, I explained why zero fraud is a bad goal.)\nThe audit said the city should disqualify all of a landlord\u2019s buildings just because some have serious violations. That\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to know if a building\u2019s problems are because of a bad landlord or because the HSTPA and Rent Guidelines Board\nstarved it of revenue\n.\nThe audit says voucher holders should not be moved into units with roaches. Roaches are disgusting. But they are not as\ndangerous\nas\nhomelessness\n.\nIf the city kicked out tenants from all apartments with roaches, people would go ballistic and the shelter population would skyrocket. Of course the city doesn\u2019t do that. Why should it treat voucher users any differently?\nTo an auditor poring over paperwork, a defective window guard sounds like a life-threatening hazard. But in reality it probably means a few loose screws that can be tightened in seconds. One landlord said a\nsingle missing screw\ncost him a voucher tenant.\nEven if a window guard is broken, a new one\ncosts only $40\nand can be installed faster than an inspector can complete a rejection form. Most landlords have spare window guards on hand.\nI don\u2019t think State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, or Kenrick Sifontes, who directed the\naudit\n, would want to tell homeless families they can\u2019t move into an apartment because one window guard was missing a screw at inspection.\nA lot is at stake for landlords, tenants and taxpayers. CityPHEPS vouchers were a $1.2 billion program last fiscal year. The City Council is suing to force the city to spend even more.\nBefore being elected, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said he would stop fighting the lawsuit, but he hasn\u2019t yet. His budget office might advise him to keep litigating or settle rather than lose billions of dollars for his other priorities. Whatever happens, he is sure to increase voucher spending.\nThat could reduce homelessness, allowing the mayor to shift some of the Department of Homeless Services\u2019\n$4 billion budget\nto permanent housing.\nApartments are\nmuch cheaper\nthan shelters and hotels. However, if left vacant in a quest for perfection, they are useless.\nDiNapoli\u2019s audit has good suggestions about improving oversight and record-keeping. But the notion that the city should only place voucher users in pristine apartments owned by landlords with spotless records is unrealistic.\n",

The Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector received unanimous board support to partner with\nBid4Assets\nto conduct the online sales. The lots consist of either houses or vacant parcels that were seized as a result of unpaid property taxes.\nMinimum bids for the real estate will start as low as $100 for several properties in Lake Elsinore and Wildomar. The highest minimum ask listed was nearly $1.2 million for a residential property in\nDesert Hot Springs\n, according to My News L.A. The current total estimated value of all the properties combined is more than $28.9 million. Minimum bid amounts represent both sales and tax costs, and some might be reduced if certain properties don\u2019t generate interest in the first round of bidding.\nThis is the 14th year that Riverside County has used internet-based auctioning for its entire collection of assets with liens.\nThe choice of website to sell the properties drew questions from residents, with one\nRancho Mirage\nresident telling the board he doesn\u2019t understand why the county is using \u201cthis internet-based bidding outfit to dispose of these properties.\u201d\n\u201cFor common everyday people like me, it\u2019s difficult [to access high-speed internet],\u201d Rancho Mirage local Brad Anderson said. \u201cPeople should have the option of using other avenues, other than the internet.\n\u201dCounty officials noted that if an interested bidder lacks proper internet connection at home, they can use computers at public libraries and other facilities. \u201cThis makes it so that people don\u2019t have to go to individual properties to make a bid. That\u2019s the real advantage,\u201d board chair Karen Spiegel said.\nWhile 946 properties are slated for sale at auction, individual lots could be taken off the list if owners satisfy their tax liens ahead of time.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hot on the heels of\nTerrell\u2019s\nfirst built-to-rent development, affordable housing developer\nDominium Apartments\nis planning another rental home community in the suburb east of Dallas.\nThe Plymouth, Minnesota-based developer plans to start construction this year on a $70 million built-to-rent community at 1010 Rose Hill Road in Terrell, according to a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filing. Dominium plans to complete the project in May 2028.\nThe 66-acre, 480,000-square-foot development will include 350 units, which works out to $200,000 per unit. The units will be a mix of single-level buildings and two-story duplexes. The community will also include a clubhouse, a pool, playgrounds and a school bus shelter. These filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe lot is just down the road from the Woodlands Terrell, the city\u2019s first single-family built-to-rent project, developed by Altura Homes in 2023. While Dominium focuses on affordable housing, Altura billed its development as \u201cluxury living in the country.\u201d Dominium is new to the built-to-rent game, and started construction on its first single-family rental-home community in May 2025 in the Phoenix area.\nNorth Texas is one of the leading regions in the country for built-to-rent development. Texas went into 2025 with the\nbiggest pipeline of built-to-rent units in the country\n, notching about\n22,000 units in development\nacross the Texas Triangle. Between June and September 2025,\nDallas ranked second nationally in built-to-rent construction\n, trailing only Phoenix. Fort Worth came in fourth place behind Atlanta. Combined, the cities totaled over 9,000 units under construction.\nBTR developments have mostly spread away from Dallas\u2019 urban core, with\nFort Worth and McKinney\nleading the Metroplex.\nTerrell is about 40 miles east of Dallas on Interstate 20 in\nrapidly growing Kaufman County\n, which saw the second-fastest population increase in the country from 2023 to 2024, according to the Census Bureau.\nWhile the area\u2019s population boom has ramped up its housing needs, the spate of new development in Terrell has piqued residents concerned about congestion, rising home prices and strain on schools. Community concerns delayed approval for\nTerra Nova\n, a 2,000-acre development proposed by Main Square last year. The Plano-based developer modified the project to address concerns.\nAmid increasing home supply, the price of newly built homes and the median sale price of all homes\nboth fell 5 percent year over year\nin Kaufman County last summer.\n",

        "content": "UBS is adding another high-profile tenant win to Uptown Dallas, signing on for a new office hub aimed at reshaping how the Swiss banking giant trains and deploys financial advisers in the U.S.\nThe wealth management firm will take 26,000 square feet at 23Springs, a 26-story office building at 2323 Cedar Springs Road, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The filing, first\nreported\nby the Dallas Morning News, estimates UBS will spend $5.6 million on the buildout, with construction slated to start this week and wrap up by June.\nThe new offices will house about 170 employees as part of its Wealth Advice Center, which is focused on serving mass affluent clients through a mix of in-person and centralized advisory services, according to the publication. Dallas will serve as one of four primary hubs for the center nationwide.\nThe move adds to Dallas\u2019 growing reputation as a financial services magnet, a trend sometimes dubbed \u201cY\u2019all Street.\u201d Firms like\nGoldman Sachs\nand\nScotiabank\nhave committed to bringing thousands of jobs to North Texas, clustering largely around Uptown and Victory Park, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Dallas hub follows previously announced Wealth Advice Centers in Weehawken, New Jersey, and Charlotte, North Carolina. UBS has said the business carries a three-year growth plan, with one hub planned for each of its four U.S. market regions. Over that period, the firm expects to hire between 400 and 500 additional advisers, Barron\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe new outpost expands, rather than replaces, UBS\u2019 existing North Texas presence. The firm already occupies two floors at the Crescent in Uptown Dallas, where it employs roughly 70 advisers and about 150 total staff.\nUBS\nalso maintains offices in Plano and Fort Worth, with about 120 advisers spread across the three locations, all of which will remain open.\nFor 23Springs, UBS adds another blue-chip name to a tenant roster that includes Bank OZK, Deloitte and law firm Sidley Austin at the corner of Maple Avenue and Cedar Springs Road. The 625,000-square-foot building is Uptown\u2019s tallest office building and was about 63 percent leased as of August.\n23Springs is a joint venture between Dallas-based\nGranite Properties\nand Highwoods Properties, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based office real estate investment trust, according to the outlet.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "For months,\nrecord rents have been the norm\nfor Manhattan.\nDecember was no different, when median rent for a brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,720, the second-highest number on record, according to a new report from Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. The number also marks a 9 percent annual increase.\nThe numbers show that despite\nflagging mortgage rates\nand a change in the season, high demand is the dominant force in New York City\u2019s rental market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any relief for tenants in 2026,\u201d said report author and appraiser Jonathan Miller.\nThe trend in high rents started in February 2025, odd considering rents usually spike in the summer. But they continued on a tear, reaching a $4,750 per month median in Manhattan in November.\nAlthough elevated mortgage rates may have contributed to the trend by keeping would-be buyers renting, their decline hasn\u2019t put an end to high rents.\nIn fact, both the sale and rental markets are seeing price growth, Miller said. The two usually counter one another, meaning high demand and inbound migration of affluent consumers has likely altered the market, he said. About one-fifth of all leases ended with a bidding war in Manhattan, with renters paying about 9 percent above asking price.\n\u201cSupply and vacancy remain below long-term averages, so the market remains generally tight,\u201d Miller said.\nDespite talk of a \u201cK-shaped\u201d economy, with the rich pulling away from the general populace in terms of income and spending, Miller said we\u2019re not yet seeing a total bifurcation of the market. Median rents for doorman and non-doorman buildings alike are growing at similar rates.\nIn Brooklyn, median rent was $3,850, a more than 10 percent rise from one year ago. About 30 percent of leases were the result of a bidding war in the borough.\nIn northwest Queens, including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City, median rent was $3,652 per month. That represented a 7.6 percent jump from a year prior.",

        "content": "The village of Wellington is moving forward with annexing nearly 450 acres of farmland owned by the Kolter Group, despite objections from Palm Beach County.\nWellington\u2019s Village Council unanimously approved on first reading an ordinance for the annexation of Artistry Lakes at 18551 State Road 80, on Southern Boulevard, at its meeting on Monday. Records show those properties are owned by Kolter\u2019s KH Artistry Lakes LLC, which paid about $75 million assembling 446 acres. Kolter has the right to build 534 residential units.\nPalm Beach County has already approved zoning that will enable the development of 480 single-family homes and 54 workforce townhomes, Tim Stillings, Wellington\u2019s director of Planning, Zoning and Building told council members. Artistry Lakes also includes areas zoned for 23,500 square feet of commercial office and 23,500 square feet of retail.\nThe area is just north of Wellington and west of Arden, a 1,210-acre master planned community zoned for about 2,300 single-family homes where\nLennar\n,\nGL Homes\n, Kenco Communities and other homebuilders are active.\nA second reading vote on the annexation is tentatively scheduled for March 10. Because no one lives on the property it won\u2019t require a referendum. And while the annexation is listed on the village agenda as \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d a letter from Kolter vice president Brian Grove stated that the developer so far has no objections to the annexation.\nThe county, however, filed an objection on Monday, since Artistry Lakes is not yet developed and separated from the village by Southern Boulevard and a canal. Additionally, the land immediately south of Artistry Lakes within Wellington consists of thousands of acres of undeveloped land owned by the South Florida Water Management District, wrote Palm Beach County Planning Director Thuy Shutt.\nStillings countered that 60 percent of Artistry Lakes\u2019 borders are adjacent to single-family subdivisions, which complies with state law.\nCounty officials previously objected to Wellington annexing 258 acres of rural land at Southern Boulevard and Seminole Pratt Whitney Road about a mile away. However, that land was officially made part of Wellington last year following a referendum and later rezoned for residential and commercial development.\nThere are three proposals to build in the newly annexed area, including a pair of Live Local Act projects, each with 106 residential units, and a townhouse project with 206 units, Stillings told\nThe Real Deal\nvia email.\nKolter has been busy.\nLed by CEO Bobby Julien, Kolter affiliate Kolter Urban closed on\n$425.3 million in condo deals\nat its recently finished Selene Oceanfront Residences in Fort Lauderdale.\nKolter and Perko Development Partners\nare also launching sales for a 19-story Maison d\u2019Or condo tower in West Palm Beach.\nKnown for its polo fields, Wellington has attracted increased interest from developers including West Palm Beach-based builder\nSteve Ross\nwho intends to build a private school with 500 residential units and a 180-key hotel. The council also recently approved zoning changes that developer\nMark Bellissimo needs to build Marketplace at the Wellington\n, an 18-acre project with 80 hotel rooms, 89 condo units and 117,000 square feet of commercial and office space.",

Earlier commentary indicated that Jamison was in financing talks to pay the loan off, but that was before the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt came due.\nThe $55 million loan on 3500 West 6th Street, called City Center on 6th, originated in November 2019 and names David Lee \u2014 who co-founded the company that his daughter\nJaime Lee\nnow leads \u2014\u00a0 as a sponsor; David Lee is still chairman. The debt has a current balance of about $51 million, per Morningstar.\nA Jamison spokesperson said in a statement that the company \u201cengaged CBRE and signed a term sheet with a CMBS provider to refinance the matured loan, which is expected to close in 45 days,\u201d and that \u201ctransferring the loan to the special servicer was a strategic decision in an effort to obtain an extension to work out a refinance.\u201d\nSpecial servicer CW Capital Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe three-level, 165,000-square-foot mall was last appraised in September 2020 and received a valuation of $75.6 million, per Morningstar. The mall counts Korean supermarket chain H Mart as a tenant. The shopping center was only 76 percent occupied as of September last year.\nJamison has a number of loans on Los Angeles properties that are in special servicing \u2014 811 Wilshire is one. The latest servicer commentary notes the borrower was unable to pay off the loan and after a deal to sell the downtown office building fell apart, Jamison faces foreclosure, which means not much has changed since\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nearlier reporting\n.\nDavid Lee is the named sponsor on the special serviced loans connected to 811 Wilshire, Equitable Plaza (a 32-story, 688,000-square-foot office tower at 3425 Wilshire Boulevard) and Central Plaza (four, 12-story office buildings located along Wilshire Boulevard), too, according to Morningstar data. But the borrower entered into forbearance agreements on the loans.\nThe collective current balance of the special serviced debt on the four properties mentioned above totals about $230 million.\n",

The project, first\nreported\nby Block Club Chicago, will combine athletic facilities with academic and cultural uses.\nPlans call for sports facilities, an academic learning center and an arts and culture hall, along with a music and media studio, cafe, teaching kitchen, indoor baseball diamond, event space, parking and outdoor areas. The city selected the project through a request for proposals issued last fall aimed at jump-starting new neighborhood amenities and job opportunities on the West Side.\nThe development team is minority-led and West Side-based, a key criterion for the city\u2019s selection.

The Brim Foundation is partnering with P3 Markets, the local developer of projects like Bronzeville\u2019s\n43 Green\n, to develop the complex.\nThe development will be built on\ncity-owned parcels\nthat will be sold to the development team for about $996,000 \u2014 their appraised value \u2014 according to DPD.

The site sits within the Madison Street Corridor Study area, a three-mile stretch from Hoyne Avenue to Kenton Avenue targeted for long-term public and private investment. It also lies near the $7 billion 1901 Project, which aims to transform land around the\nUnited Center\nwith new entertainment venues, retail, hotels, green space and affordable housing.\n\u201cThe project\u2019s strategic mix of uses and high-quality design will contribute to Madison Street\u2019s ongoing revitalization, while supporting community health and well-being, especially for area youth,\u201d Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said in a\nnews release\n.\nNext steps include a community meeting with leaders from the 27th Ward to gather input and refine plans before moving toward final approvals, according to the news release.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Transwestern is moving its Chicago office to the top of a downtown office tower that has a new Sterling Bay leasing team.\nThe Houston-based real estate services firm signed a lease for roughly 35,000 square feet spanning the top three floors of the 30-story building at 123 North Wacker Drive, according to a company announcement first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Transwestern plans to relocate its Chicago flagship to the penthouse space this fall, consolidating from a space it currently occupies across the buildings at 200 West Madison Street and 181 West Madison Street, its longtime Loop outposts.\nThe move puts\nTranswestern\nin familiar company. Rival CBRE recently decamped to new offices at the building at 300 North LaSalle Street, while Newmark is preparing to relocate its Chicago team to Salesforce Tower Chicago.\nFor\nTranswestern\n, the deal is about more than an address upgrade. Executive Managing Director and Greater Chicago Market Leader Blake Johnson said the new office signals the next phase of the company\u2019s growth in Chicago.\nThe lease carries added weight for the landlord. The 595,000-square-foot tower at\n123 North Wacker\nis owned by a venture led by Los Angeles-based\nMesa West Capital\n, which took control of the property in late 2024 after Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management struggled under a $153 million debt package originated in 2021. With office values sagging amid weak demand and higher interest rates, LaSalle had little incentive to pour fresh capital into leasing as the loan matured, according to the outlet.\nMesa West, which provided a $37 million mezzanine loan as part of that capital stack, stepped in with plans to stabilize and lease up the building. A Mesa West venture was later listed as the borrower on a $115 million senior loan from Wells Fargo, property records show. The firm brought in Sterling Bay brokers to oversee leasing at the tower, which was about 65 percent leased before the Transwestern deal, according to CoStar.\nSterling Bay\u2019s Austin Lusson framed the lease as evidence that top-tier buildings are regaining momentum downtown. Transwestern\u2019s own leasing team, led by Executive Vice President Eric Myers, will also help market the property.\nThe move leaves behind a looming vacancy at the building at 200 West Madison, where Transwestern\u2019s lease expires at year-end. The 45-story tower, owned by BentallGreenOak, is about 86 percent leased \u2014 well above the downtown average \u2014 but will soon be hunting for a sizable backfill, as one of its longest-tenured tenants heads west to Wacker Drive.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of the women who accused Oren and Alon Alexander of sexual assault was found dead last year.\nWhiteman\nwas one of two women\nwho\nsued the brothers\nunder New York\u2019s Adult Survivors Act.\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported the lawsuits in June 2024, which kicked off a wave of women coming forward with similar allegations against twins Oren and Alon, along with older brother Tal, that culminated in\ntheir December 2024 arrests\n.\nWhiteman was found dead near Sydney, Australia,\nThe New York Times reported\n. Her death is under investigation and a cause of death has not been determined. Her attorney, Evan Torgan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhiteman was 45.\nWhiteman sued the twin brothers under a New York provision, which allowed survivors to sue their perpetrators regardless of when the alleged attacks occurred. The law created a lookback window between Nov. 23, 2022, and Nov. 23, 2023. Whiteman initiated her lawsuit, which also named music producer Ivan Wilzig as a defendant but did not accuse him of rape, one day before the period expired.\nBefore the 2024 lawsuit, Whiteman had previously filed a summons in 2022 against the same three defendants, but did not file a complaint and that case ultimately did not move forward.\nWhiteman met Oren and Alon in New York City around 2008 and continued to run into them in social circles, including at a nightclub in the Hamptons in 2012, according to the complaint. She alleges that Alon grabbed her outside of a nightclub and ushered her into a car with Oren, which took her to a party at Sir Ivan\u2019s Castle, a mansion in Water Mill owned by Wilzig.\nIn a garage at the home, she claimed the brothers locked up her phone and forced her to change into sarong. She alleges that when she tried to run away, a security guard \u201cdragged her back.\u201d The twins then brought her into another room and raped her, according to the complaint.\nThe brothers have repeatedly denied all allegations.\nThey are set to go to trial later this month\non federal sex trafficking charges. In multiple indictments, prosecutors have alleged that between 2008 and 2021, Oren, Tal and Alon participated in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. They allege that the brothers worked together to repeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault and rape dozens of women, some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged attacks.\nThe brothers\nfiled a lawsuit against TRD in June\nalleging defamation and in part disputing coverage that excluded materials the brothers had provided to try to discredit victims.\nTRD\nPublisher Amir Korangy pushed back on the claims in the suit, telling the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe are confident the courts will see this for what it is\u2014a frivolous and cynical attempt to weaponize the legal system.\u201d",

        "content": "A grand jury has indicted Vision &amp; Beyond and co-founders Stanislav Grinberg and Peter Gizunterman for a $50 million bank fraud conspiracy.\nThe Israeli entrepreneurs allegedly double-pledged properties to obtain multiple loans and worked with two title company employees to hide information from lenders and\ninvestors\n.\nGrinberg and Gizunterman, who met while serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, founded Vision &amp; Beyond in 2019 and acquired 100 apartments and residential properties in and around Cincinnati, with the goal of renovating the properties.\nBut the pair allegedly started by double pledging properties to get loans. They also inflated financial information such as rent rolls to obtain larger loans than they should have received from lenders, according to the criminal complaint.\nThen their alleged fraud went further. Grinberg and Gizunterman allegedly used two title company employees, Keya Hamilton and Kelly West to refinance properties, but did not use the funds to pay off the existing loans and mortgages.\nIn December 2022, Grinberg and Gizunterman secured two loans from Corevest Financial totaling more than $36 million to refinance 30 mortgages tied to 60 multi-family properties in the Cincinnati area.\nBut Vision &amp; Beyond stopped paying the loan balance in 2024 and the loans went into default. Grinberg and Gizunterman told the loans\u2019 special servicer that they stopped paying the loans because they had to reenlist with the Israeli Defense Force to fight in the war in Gaza.\nAccording to the indictment, Grinberg and Gizunterman only used the loan proceeds to pay off a fraction of the prior mortgages.\nInstead, more than $273,000 was allegedly paid directly to Hamilton, and about $7 million was paid to a title company controlled by Hamilton and used by Vision &amp; Beyond. About $6 million was paid directly to Vision &amp; Beyond\u2019s account and $2.7 million was paid to another bank, according to the indictment.\nGrinberg was arrested in March, but his indictment was delayed. He is currently in jail in Butler County, Ohio. Ginsburg and his alleged co-conspirators are charged with conspiring to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, making false statements and money laundering.\nVision &amp; Beyond\u2019s properties in Cincinnati have fallen into disrepair, leading with severe water leaks and piled up trash.\nThe indictment is the latest in a broader investigation into\ncommercial mortgage fraud\nby the Department of Justice and the Federal Home Finance Agency. Many of the participants in these fraud schemes bought residential properties in the Midwest such as Cincinnati where property values were relatively inexpensive.\n",

Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was most recently appraised at $47.5 million or $171,480 per unit. Walker &amp; Dunlop provided a $25.7 million mortgage for the acquisition, according to loan documents.\nRise 120 opened in the first quarter of 2024. It offers one-, two- and three-bedroom units and features a pool, fitness center, walking trails, business center, clubhouse and 15,000 square feet of ground-level retail.\nThe property is about 24 miles north of Austin. In 2024, Georgetown was the fastest-growing city in the country for the third year in a row, with its population increasing by more than 50 percent since 2020, Census Bureau data shows. Georgetown\ncrossed the 100,000-resident mark\nin 2025.\nAs a result, Georgetown, in Williamson County, has become a hotspot for development, including a\nmassive expansion at Southwestern University\n, which is within the town. The college tapped Austin-based Banbury Development to develop a 560-acre mixed-used district, envisioned as a \u201cmini city\u201d with housing, offices, retail, restaurants, a boutique hotel, cultural spaces and a concert venue.\nThe\nTexas Municipal League\nin October announced it\u2019s leaving Austin and is relocating to Georgetown. The league said it plans to \u201cinvest millions\u201d to renovate the four-story, 64,000-square-foot Wesleyan Building at 205 East University Avenue.\nWilliamson County\u2019s booming growth has pushed county officials to\nimplement development guardrails\n. The county changed subdivision regulations in 2025 to require developers to conduct traffic impact studies and secure water service commitments earlier in the development process.\nGeorgetown\u2019s growth trajectory combined with the apartment building\u2019s newness mean it\u2019s insulated from the struggles of Austin\u2019s multifamily market. Austin rents and occupancy plummeted after the area saw a flurry of apartment development. The market has been stabilizing, with occupancy flat in the 12-month period ending in October, but rents still fell last year, posting a 4.8 percent decline during the same period, according to data from Yardi Matrix.\n",

It also has a pool and outdoor kitchen.\nGoeseke said penthouse buyers wanted the convenience and security of a condo without sacrificing the creature comforts of a single-family home.\n\u201cWe wanted a house within a condo,\u201d she said of the penthouses at Vita.\nGoeseke pointed to Grove Isle\u2019s private island status as a significant appeal; it has added security benefits without the ferry ride, like on Fisher Island.\nColombo\u2019s CMC Group completed the seven-story, 65-unit Vita in December, following a decade-long legal battle over the site.\nBank OZK provided\na $239 million construction loan\nin 2024.\nIt was 85 percent presold\n, with 10 units remaining for sale. Prices range from $6.5 million to $22 million for a penthouse.\nIt was the only luxury condominium completed in Coconut Grove last year, a market with strong demand for luxury homes and consistent price growth. Earlier this month, Shaklee CEO Roger Barnett and his wife, journalist Sloan Barnett, sold their waterfront mansion in the neighborhood for\n$71.9 million\n.",

        "content": "The Port of Oakland has chosen a local soccer team and Los Angeles-based industrial developer to reimagine the Howard Terminal site.\nThe port\nchose proposals\nfrom\nOakland Roots Sports Club\nand Industrial Realty Group to transform the Howard Terminal location, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Port officials will soon begin hammering out an exclusive negotiating agreement with the entities and have already closed a\nrequest for proposals\n.\nOakland Roots SC and Industrial Realty were two of nearly a dozen firms that bid to redevelop the 55-acre waterfront property. The port began fielding ideas for redevelopment in 2024 after the Athletics departed Oakland.\nPart of the Oakland Roots\u2019 plan involves the construction of a soccer stadium for the Roots and Soul soccer teams. Industrial Realty, meanwhile, is looking to support traditional commodity-based maritime operations, a source close to the matter told the Business Times, though plans are not clear.\nThe Roots are making the \u201cnext steps toward negotiating an exclusive negotiation agreement to explore redevelopment opportunities at\nHoward Terminal\nfor a stadium for Oakland Roots and Soul SC,\u201d Lydia Tan, chief real estate officer for the Roots, said in a statement to the Business Times. \u201cThis would be an important step in evaluating a long-term home for the club, subject to further discussions and approvals.\u201d\nIn October, the port tacked on an addendum to its request for proposals that specified different uses for various portions of the 55-acre site. The westernmost 36 acres would be set aside for\nindustrial uses\n, while 14 acres to the east would be allocated for commercial development; designated uses for the remaining 5 acres aren\u2019t clear. The different requested uses allows the port to consider two projects on opposite sides of the site, as floated by the Roots and Industrial Realty.\nThe Board of Port Commissioners has to sign off on the plans. The port was previously in a four-year exclusive negotiating agreement to build a new 35,000-seat stadium, thousands of residences and millions of square feet of commercial space and public amenities, but the agreement expired in 2023. Last year, the Roots submitted a proposal to build a 25,000-seat stadium at Howard Terminal, first starting with a temporary modular stadium while building a larger permanent one. The Roots have the option to use an already certified environmental review report prepared by the Athletics for their development at Howard Terminal, saving the team time and money in the development process.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

WebAI also plans to install signage near the top of the building at the southeast corner of Sixth Street and Congress, replacing the PMG marquee that currently crowns the tower.\nStream Realty Partners\u2019 Cameron Grier, Brita Hovde and Brad Philp handle leasing for the building at 515 Congress, which is owned by Newport Beach, California-based KBS Realty Advisors. According to Stream, KBS has spent more than $10 million on renovations since 2015 to the 1974-built Class A office building.\nWebAI initially leased the top floor of the building about two years ago and has been steadily adding space as it scales. Its headquarters will sit on the 26th floor, complete with a private elevator, while the ground-floor space will house an engineering lab with freight elevator access for specialized hardware, co-founder and CEO David Stout told the outlet.\nThe office expansion follows a fresh\nfunding round\nannounced Jan. 14 that pegged the company\u2019s valuation at $2.5 billion \u2014 a dramatic leap from the roughly $700 million valuation it carried when it burst onto the scene in 2024. Investors in the round included Time Ventures,\nAtreides Management\n, Forerunner and Oxcart Ventures, according to the publication.\nFounded on the idea that AI doesn\u2019t need to live in massive,\ncentralized data centers\n, WebAI has developed an on-device system designed to let enterprises deploy AI, while keeping sensitive data local and private. It gives companies the flexibility of automation and generative AI without handing over proprietary or customer data to the cloud, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe company employs about 150 people today and expects to reach 200 soon, with the bulk of its workforce based in\nTexas\n. According to the outlet, WebAI also has offices in Virginia, focused on public-sector work, and in Michigan. Last fall, it named Jason Rathje \u2014 a former MIT research scientist and leader at the Pentagon-backed Office of Strategic Capital and the Air Force\u2019s AFWERX \u2014 as president of its public sector.\nWebAI is also pushing into new territory, including aviation and connected devices, while preparing to launch a consumer-facing product that applies AI to personal data without uploading it elsewhere, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Office rents are high and vacancies low amid a slump in new development. Industrial leasing prices are holding steady, but landlords are starting to offer tenant incentives. And multifamily is settling into a more normalized growth pattern after years of fast-paced development, panelists said at the\nCCIM\nconference, held at Florida International University\u2019s south campus this week.\nRetail\nRetail is the darling in South Florida commercial real estate. The sector\u2019s fundamentals are solid, and landlords have seen rent growth since the pandemic, said Franklin Street\u2019s Carrie Smith.\n\u201cIf you are a well-positioned asset, you\u2019re probably feeling pretty good,\u201d she said.\nGrocery-anchored centers are still the most desirable assets, with occupancy averaging 95 to 96 percent compared to low 90s for unanchored properties, she said.\nSeven of last year\u2019s biggest retail transactions involved outdoor shopping centers, selling for a combined $636 million and representing more than half of the\n$1.2 billion\nin combined retail sales for the year\u2019s top 11 deals, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. Half of the outdoor shopping centers in the biggest transactions are anchored by grocery stores.\nMuch of retail\u2019s momentum has come from Florida\u2019s population growth and business expansion, Smith said.\nThe state\u2019s elimination of sales tax on commercial leases in 2024 was a \u201chuge win\u201d for retailers and restaurateurs.Miami retail rents are among the highest in the country.\n\u201cMiami market rents compared to the country are almost double,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing rents in the mid-to-high $40s per square foot triple-net, and some topping triple digits. Supply is low for the demand we\u2019re seeing \u2014 not only in this market, but throughout the Southeast.\u201d\nOffice\nThe office market has experienced turbulence since 2024, after a boom in tenant demand and rents in downtown submarkets the previous two years, said CBRE\u2019s Grant Killingsworth.\n\u201cThe spigot of new tenants from the Northeast quickly dried out,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cWe had landlords with debt coming due turning the keys back to the bank.\u201d\nSome office property owners faced more dire consequences last year.\nA joint venture led by Boston-based Rockpoint sold One Clearlake office tower in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\nin May, representing a 26 percent discount from its 2021 sale price. And New York-based R&amp;B Realty lost\nGateway at Wynwood\n, a Miami mixed-use project with 195,000 square feet of offices, in a bankruptcy auction in August.\nEven so, high-end submarkets saw spectacular rent growth.\n\u201cBrickell went from $65 a foot to $150 a foot,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cThat\u2019s trophy pricing, the same as Midtown Manhattan.\u201d\nSigns Brickell is still booming include Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s\n$275 million\nacquisition of the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center, and a\n$630 million\nrefinancing for 830 Brickell, 57-story high-rise completed in 2024 by Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group and Cain International.\nOther neighborhoods are benefiting from tenant migration.\n\u201cCoral Gables became very attractive,\u201d Killingsworth said. \u201cFinancial companies that normally never went there are moving because commute times are less and it\u2019s half the cost\u201d of Brickell.\nLooking ahead, the office market will hold steady, Killingsworth said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of the challenging debt cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of new construction planned in the next three years. I don\u2019t foresee any major disruption in rents.\u201d\nIndustrial\nSouth Florida\u2019s industrial sector hit a lull after several years of runaway growth, CommReal\u2019s Edison Vasquez said.\nVacancy went from 5 percent to 6 percent, and it\u2019s more of a balanced market, favoring tenants, he said.\u201cWe saw incentives from anywhere between six to twelve months of improvement allowances and moving expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what they can to avoid empty spaces.\u201d\nBut sales are strong.\n\u201cEnd users will likely pay 10 to 15 percent more than investors, with user sales averaging $275 a square foot and some hitting $300,\u201d Vasquez said.\nBlackstone\nsold about $1.9 billion in warehouse portfolios to institutional buyers last year, he said.\nThis year will bring more rent stabilization and increased leasing activity, he said.\nLand pricing has a disconnect. Sellers want $3 to $4 million an acre, while developers can only pay between $2 million to $2.5 million.\n\u201cThis year will be key to resolving that,\u201d he said.\nOperators face headwinds from property taxes and insurance, but limited inventory should keep values high.\n\u201cPeople are waiting for prices to collapse,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that happening. Prices will continue to stay strong due to limited availability and lower interest rates.\u201d\nMultifamily\nMiami-Dade\u2019s multifamily sector is entering an era of stabilization after years of extreme rent growth fueled by pandemic migrations to South Florida, Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Mitash Kripalani said.\nThe market peaked in 2021 and 2022, when capital was inexpensive and liquidity abundant, he said.\n\u201cRising interest rates slowed down transaction activity, but pricing per unit has remained stable because of strong demand and disciplined investors,\u201d he said\nDevelopment continues at a furious pace, especially in Miami-Dade. About 50,000 units are under construction across South Florida, and over 30,000 of those are in Miami-Dade, most of them in the urban core, he said.\n\u201cDevelopers are choosing dense, walkable, transit-oriented locations with strong employment drivers,\u201d he said.\nSome developers shelved planned projects and sold their entitled\nmultifamily sites\nlast year.\nWith borrowing costs expected to ease this year, Kripalani predicted renewed investment momentum.\n\u201cStable occupancy, stable rents, and improving liquidity is setting the stage for a gradual recovery,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "After more than two decades of false starts, Schaumburg village trustees this week took a decisive step toward resolving the long-running fate of the Loeber Farm site, approving a specific residential development for the 33-acre parcel near the border with Rolling Meadows.\nThe plan, pitched by Elmhurst-based Nitti Group, calls for a mix of 122 for-sale homes, including 43 single-family homes, 37 rowhouses spread across eight buildings, and 42 townhouses in 16 buildings on land just off Meacham Road,\naccording\nto the Daily Herald. It replaces a far\ndenser proposa\nl floated two years ago for 357 rental apartments, townhouses and rowhomes \u2014 a plan that drew fierce opposition from residents and officials in neighboring Rolling Meadows before it was pulled, the outlet reported.\nCommunity resistance\n, however, is hardly new at\nLoeber Farm\n. The property, off Meacham Road near Algonquin Road, has been the subject of competing visions and political friction since the early 2000s, with neighbors repeatedly raising concerns about flooding along Salt Creek, and traffic congestion on a two-lane stretch of Meacham Road. Those issues resurfaced during deliberations on the Nitti plan and remain unresolved even after Tuesday\u2019s approval, according to the outlet.\nThe total development cost for\nNitti\u2019s project\nis pegged at $82 million. Schaumburg is weighing extension of a nearby tax increment financing district that would provide up to $4.8 million in TIF assistance for eligible improvements, out of roughly $17 million in revenue the site is expected to generate over the remaining life of the district.\nThose costs include new water and sewer utilities, a bridge over Salt Creek and a sanitary lift station necessitated by the site\u2019s elevations, according to Schaumburg Economic Development Director Matt Frank. Mayor Tom Dailly said during the meeting that a TIF could help rein in development costs that may have pushed earlier proposals toward higher density. He also flagged the need for a bridge capable of supporting fire engines, a structure he estimated could cost at least $1 million on its own.\nTrustees previously approved Toll Brothers\u2019 55-home plan in 2005, only to see the builder walk away. Dartmoor Homes followed with a similar proposal in 2007, just ahead of the housing market\u2019s collapse, according to the outlet.\nThe land has been owned since 1948 by the family behind Loeber Motors, which operates a luxury dealership in Lincolnwood. After years of stalled negotiations, the family even sought to disconnect the property from Schaumburg in 2020, though that lawsuit was dismissed a year later.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

While the other retail space near Barclays Center has enjoyed a resurgence, Rihanna hasn\u2019t put in the\nwork, work, work, work, work, work\nat 182 Flatbush.\nSigns of progress have been\nnonexistent\nbeyond a sign reading \u201cSavage x Fenty Signature Script Collection\u201d observed at the site in 2024. Alas, no one secured a permit for the advertisement, resulting in an ECB violation.\nWhen a blizzard hit late last month, plywood boards fell from the building onto the sidewalk, and neither Rihanna nor the landlord, Hidrock Properties\u2019 182 Flatbush Ave LLC, sent anyone to clear the snow, as you can see from the photograph above.\nThe city ignored the icy sidewalk but slapped Hidrock with a\n$12,500 violation\nfor the plywood mishap, which was resolved 12 days later. In 2023, the owner paid a $1,250 fine for\nleaving a storefront window open\nthree years after a gut demolition of the interior.\nThis is pocket change for Hidrock\u2019s LLC. All this time, Fenty has been paying \u201cdark rent,\u201d meaning rent for unused space, according to one of the Compass brokers who worked on the lease. Given that the asking rent was $650,000 per year, the total paid so far could be about $2.5 million.\nSo, while Rihanna has some\nwork\nto do, Hidrock seems to be doing fine at 182 Flatbush. In 2024, Hidrock\u2019s Abraham J. Hidary reduced the debt to $4 million from $5.2 million as he extended its mortgage with Israel Discount Bank, according to property records.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe name of 182 Flatbush Avenue\u2019s previous owner should ring a bell for\nTRD\nreaders. RedSky JZ purchased the property for $4.1 million in 2012 and sold it to Hidrock for $7 million in 2019.\nThat sale was a rare bright spot for RedSky at the time. By then, things were already\nfalling apart\nfor\nBen Bernstein\nand\nBen Stokes\n\u2019 firm, which had partnered with JZ Capital on that deal and others, assembling a\n$1 billion retail portfolio\n.\nStokes left RedSky in 2024, but his former Cornell squash team member Bernstein is still a principal, according to LinkedIn. Will either Ben ever make another billion-dollar run? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Real estate has something riding on the race to succeed retiring Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who is among the most pro-housing elected officials in the city, is facing off in June\u2019s Democratic primary against Democratic Socialists of America member Claire Valdez, who serves in the state Assembly.\nReynoso is better known, more experienced and has deeper roots in the district, but Valdez has Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s\nendorsement\n. It will be interesting to see how much support from the real estate industry Reynoso receives and accepts and whether it funds a PAC to attack Valdez, as it has done with other DSA candidates.\nElsewhere\u2026\nVoice of Gowanus, a group that formed in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the neighborhood\u2019s 2021 rezoning, continues to seek revenge against Brad Lander, who, as the local City Council member, spearheaded the new zoning.\nThis week, the group cheered Rep. Daniel Goldman for\nobjecting\nto a state cleanup plan and blasted Lander, who is challenging Goldman in this June\u2019s Democratic primary. Voice of Gowanus claimed that Lander wants to locate affordable housing and a school on a polluted site \u201cwithout the fully enforced remediation required by law, leaving behind a massive reservoir of coal tar underground.\u201d\nWhether you like Lander or hate him, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to endanger residents and students. Rather, Voice of Gowanus is trying to undermine his campaign as revenge for the rezoning, which is bringing more than 8,000 badly needed apartments to Brooklyn. It also wants to delay the 950-unit, all-affordable\nGowanus Green\nproject.\nThis is the classic NIMBY strategy of claiming that development would be dangerous to its users. Opponents of a Southern California project I just\nwrote about\nmade the same argument, citing not only wildfires but also pollution from chemicals used on the golf course where 398 homes would be built.\nNone of these people worried about golfers playing on chemically treated grass.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$15.5 million\nfor a 6,820-square-foot single-family home at 13 East 94th Street in Carnegie Hill. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$386 million\nfor roughly 368,000 square feet of office space and 28,000 square feet of retail at 555-557 Broadway in Soho. Publisher Scholastic sold the property to Empire State Realty Trust.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,898-square-foot condominium unit at 200 East 79th Street on the Upper East Side. Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss and Lisa Mathias have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 25,895-square-foot, six-story residential building at 2968 Valentine Avenue in Bedford Park. Jakov Saric of Node Architecture filed the permit on behalf of developer Franc Gjini.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The Georgian Revival home at\n13 East 94th Street\nspans more than 6,800 square feet and sold for $15.5 million, or about $2,300 per square foot. The seller was an LLC tied to\nGeorge Logothetis\n, who is the executive chairman of the Libra Group, whose businesses span from aerospace to hotels. The buyer was\nCarnegie Hill LLC\n. The residence, which went on the market about a year ago with an asking price of $19.5 million, has six bedrooms, a gym, a custom eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen, wine storage and a garden.\nSerena Boardman\nwith Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe top commercial real estate transfer recorded in New York was in Soho.\nEmpire State Realty Trust\n, the real estate investment trust led by\nAnthony Malkin\n, closed on its all-cash purchase of the\nScholastic Building at 555-557 Broadway\nfor $386 million. The property has 368,000 square feet of office space and 28,000 square feet of retail real estate.

        "content": "The bankruptcy sale of 5,151 apartments from Pinnacle Group to Summit Properties is on the eve of a possible confirmation.\nBut the sale was unable to close at a Thursday court hearing. The city and tenants had objected to the sale, prompting hours of cross examination and argument before a bankruptcy court judge. Despite conversations about a settlement between the parties, no agreement was reached by the end of the hearing, with an attorney for the city saying that getting approval from the administration would go beyond business hours.\nBy the end of the day, the U.S. bankruptcy court judge, David Jones, was considering arguments from tenants and the city that Summit Properties had failed to make adequate assurances that it could perform and cure the thousands of existing violations in the portfolio for sale.\nSummit CEO Zohar Levy had said in a declaration that Summit planned to spend $10 million in the first year on capital improvements and curing existing violations, with $30 million spent in the first five years.\nHowever, under questioning from attorneys for tenants and the city, Levy specified Summit had planned on just $3 million for the violations and that the money would not be put in escrow or confirmed in a bankruptcy order. The properties would be owned by individual LLCs and there would be no recourse to go after Summit as the parent. Levy testified remotely from Austria and said Summit had engaged REM Management to manage part of the portfolio.\nJones considered arguments that Summit had not shown \u201cadequate assurance of future performance\u201d as a purchaser. But he appeared to be encouraged by a promise by Flagstar Bank, which is the biggest creditor in the case and also the financier for Summit\u2019s potential purchase, that it would extend a $3 million line of credit to Summit to pull from should any of the repairs go over what was estimated. But Jones did not make a ruling Thursday.\nBefore final arguments, parties returned from a lunch break and told the court they had begun talking about a settlement. However, Zachary Kass, the city attorney, said the city would need to go through official channels, including engagement with Mayor Mamdani.\n\u201cGetting the city to do anything is a bit like turning a tanker,\u201d Kass said before the court, later adding that Mayor Mamdani had been engaged.\nAfter another break, the parties said they had exchanged numbers in a negotiation.\n\u201cSummit has the capacity and the commitment to preserve, restore, and improve the 5,151 units and the lives of the residents,\u201d according to Jordan Barowitz, a spokesperson for Summit, adding that the company \u201clooks forward to the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that a settlement will be discussed overnight. Kass said the city would feel more comfortable with some sort of guarantee from Summit.\nIn a declaration, Levy said only 420 units in the 5,151 unit portfolio had housing code violations.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\nAn attorney for Flagstar argued that the city was trying to be unduly involved in a bankruptcy transaction.\n\u201cWhat they really want is to pick the buyer, to pick the price,\u201d the attorney said.\n",

Blackstone acquired the debt after Signature Bank\u2019s 2023 collapse.\nThe Chetrits are members of the high-profile family of investors that has\nmultiple\ndistressed properties\nin New York. The outlet was unable to reach them for comment.\nThe brothers have faced similar troubles before. In 2024,\ndebt dealer\nMaverick Real Estate Partners, which recently bought other Chetrit holdings at auction, sought to foreclose on their SoHo property at 447 Broadway over an unpaid $14.7 million Signature\u2011issued loan. In that case, the Chetrits argued that Signature\u2019s sudden failure deprived them of the opportunity to renegotiate terms.\nThat dispute\nwas settled\nfor an undisclosed amount earlier this year, suggesting they may raise similar arguments again.\nAccording to the new complaint, the Chetrits stopped making payments on the loan in December 2024. Blackstone issued a default notice in May demanding repayment of the remaining principal \u2014 now $15.6 million \u2014 and future rents from tenants, which include a law firm, a psychology practice and an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.\nThe building is 95 percent leased at roughly $40 per square foot, but the owners allegedly did not comply with the notice.\nFor decades, 286 Fifth belonged to the Kiamie family, led by Syrian immigrant and entrepreneur Najeeb Kiamie, whose Windsor Management still operates in the market. The Chetrits, through AB &amp; Sons Group, appear to have co\u2011owned the building with the Kiamies before taking full control.\nAB &amp; Sons signed an $11.1 million mortgage in 2007, and later the 2017 loan that\u2019s now in dispute. The building changed hands internally in 2022, with ownership transferred to an entity called Zhora State Equities.\nBlackstone acquired a large portion of Signature\u2019s loan book in late 2023, including the debt tied to 286 Fifth Avenue. Court filings show AB &amp; Sons\u2019 members include Eli\u2019s son, Abraham.\nAttorneys for the ownership entities either declined to comment or were unavailable, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

Rockefeller.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman, who represented the previous seller in 2011, had the listing. The home initially hit the market in December 2024, asking $19.5 million before Boardman dropped the price to $17.5 million two months later.\nThe sale is the latest Gilded Age-era townhouse to sell\nafter a price cut\n. A home at\n973 Fifth Avenue\nsold for $46 million in May after initially asking $80 million in 2021, and the\nWoolworth Mansion\nclosed for $38 million after seeking as much as $90 million over a decade ago (more recently, the home sought $50 million).\nSpanning 6,820 square feet, the Carnegie Hill home features six bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\nThe renovated home has a basement gym and wine storage, a fully-terraced back garden and wood- and gas-burning fireplaces. The third floor has a bedroom and a south-facing wood-paneled library, and the primary suite on the floor above comes with a sitting room, dressing room and bathroom with a shower and soaking tub.\nThe top floor has four additional bedrooms, one of which has a terrace, and a large skylight.\nLogothetis founded Libra out of his father\u2019s shipping company and eventually diversified its holdings to encompass a slew of other industries including aerospace, hospitality and real estate. The company has a strategic interest in the luxury hotel brand Auberge Resort Collections after Grace Hotels merged with Auberge in 2018, according to the company\u2019s website.\nLogothetis and his wife, Nitzia, previously owned a condo at the prestigious 15 Central Park West,\nwhich they sold for $24 million in 2011\n.\n",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe top home sale recorded in South Florida came in at $58.3 million, as\nMichael Chu\n, co-founder and executive chairman of private equity firm L Catterton, and his wife\nElizabeth Chu\nparted with a home at\n102 Angler Avenue\nin Palm Beach. The buyer was a trust. The nearly 8,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half baths. The deal appears to have been off market.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction to hit records was\nGL Homes\u2019\nacquisition of 220 acres of land along\n140th Avenue North\nin Westlake from\nMinto Communities\n, the master developer of Westlake, for $80 million. GL Homes plans to merge the newly acquired acres with a 120-acre site it bought in 2024, according to the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\n. The developer intends to build 1,000 homes on the combined site.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nRestaurateur\nBarton Weiss\n, also known as Barton G., sold his home at\n1535 West 27th Street\nin Miami Beach to an LLC tied to\nDavid Moradi\n, an entrepreneur and investor, for $29.3 million. The deal for the more than 12,000-square-foot Sunset Islands mansion works out to about $2,400 per square foot. The Mediterranean-style home has nine bedrooms and nine and a half baths and sits along the canal. The property hit the market in March at $39.5 million. Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker had the listing, and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nMarko Gojanovic\nbrought the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Paul Wick\n, a financier, and his wife\nKarin Wick\n, an attorney, via a trust scooped up a newly built, four-bedroom penthouse at the Vita at Grove Isle at\n5 Grove Isle Drive\nin Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. The price was about $20.1 million. The pad has 6,900 square feet of interior space and more than 5,100 square feet of exterior space. The luxury condominium was developed by\nUgo Colombo\u2019s CMC Group.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. existing home sales surge as borrowing costs drop\nThanks to falling borrowing costs and slowing home price growth, existing-home sales in the U.S. surged by 5.1 percent in December compared to the month before.\nThere were 4.35 million existing-home sales last month \u2014 the strongest month in almost three years, according to the\nNational Association of Realtors\n, whose data has been seasonally adjusted.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Exiled\nIranian Americans in real estate\nwatching deadly protests from afar may not agree on a path to peace, but they\u2019re united in seeing this moment as an opening for democratic change in Iran.\nDemonstrations began across the country starting on Dec. 28 when Iranians took to the streets to protest economic conditions, namely inflation. The protests quickly spread with demonstrators numbering in the millions in just a few days. The Iranian government responded with an internet blackout that provided cover to security forces killing protesters; days later, the death toll is in the thousands. President Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene.\nIranians who fled to the U.S. during the 1979 revolution, many of whom settled in California,\nNew York\nand\nTexas\n, haven\u2019t been able to return. Among them is Mehrdad Moayedi, the founder of Dallas-based firm Centurion American Development, who left Tehran in 1976 and moved to Fort Worth at the age of 15. He\u2019s been in North Texas ever since.\nMoayedi, who started with a small landscaping business and became the\nregion\u2019s most prolific single-family lot developer\n, credits his success to the freedom and business friendliness of Texas and the U.S., which he calls \u201cthe greatest country in the world.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything more in my life than to see Iran become more democratic, like the United States,\u201d he said when asked about the protests. \u201cHaving said that, I think we\u2019re at a crossroads and we need some help.\u201d\nA fervent supporter of President Trump, Moayedi approves of his response to the crisis. From his perspective, the U.S. should provide weapons to unarmed Iranians, and Israel should intervene \u201cbecause it has the infrastructure.\u201d\nMoayedi sees the conflict as similar to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, except \u201cthose people are armies.\u201d In Iran, protesters \u201cdon\u2019t have any way of protecting themselves.\u201d\nJewish Iranian developer\nShahab Karmely\n, who operates in New York and South Florida, agrees with Moayedi. His father, who was in the rug business and owned real estate in Iran, was put on a death list but managed to escape with the family in 1978. Karmely, after being deported from the U.S., was taken in as a refugee in the U.K.\n\u201cThe west needs to understand there\u2019s no negotiation [with this regime]. I think President Trump has woken up to this,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cThe bloodshed is beyond anything we can imagine. The same way the Nazis had to go, this regime has to go.\u201d\nThough he stopped short of advocating for a direct invasion, Karmely said \u201cthe time for action is now,\u201d adding that \u201cthe streets are literally awash in the blood of young people.\u201d\nWhile\nAustin-based developer Ari Rastegar\nhas never visited his father\u2019s homeland, \u201cMy entire life has been these conversations and the trauma that ensued from it,\u201d he said. Born in Austin in 1982, Rastegar, who founded Rastegar Property Company, grew up listening to stories from his grandfather, who was the shah\u2019s doctor.\nLike Moayedi, he\u2019d like to see Iran\u2019s leader be someone chosen by the people of Iran, but Rastegar is skeptical about the involvement of superpowers, favoring grassroots leadership that\u2019s \u201cauthentically Iranian.\u201d And, like the diaspora at large, they disagree on how exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi should be involved in the process.\nPahlavi, the son of the last shah of Iran, moved to the U.S. at age 18 in 1978 for pilot training as a cadet in the Imperial Iranian Air Force. A face of opposition to Iran\u2019s government, he has encouraged recent protests.\nMoayedi is optimistic about Pahlavi, suggesting he could lead Iran through transition until the country can elect a leader.\nRastegar disagrees, \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about running a global government, one of the oldest countries in the history of mankind,\u201d he said about Pahlavi. \u201cLet\u2019s find somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nMoayedi and Rastegar, men from different generations who were born in different countries, agree the conflict shouldn\u2019t be used to fuel Islamophobia.\n\u201cIslam doesn\u2019t teach that kind of stuff,\u201d Moayedi said. \u201cThese are just goons and gangsters killing people left and right.\u201d\nIslam is a \u201cvery peaceful, beautiful religion,\u201d echoed Rastegar. \u201cThis is a dictator fuckhead thing. This is not a Muslim thing.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Southern California\u2019s brokerage consolidation continues with Coldwell Banker Real Estate inking yet another franchise agreement that will give it more weight in Orange County and the Inland Empire.\nJessie Rodriguez and Aaron Juarez, formerly of Cal American Homes, are the latest franchise partners with Coldwell Banker, bringing roughly 25 agents into the company\u2019s fold. The new entity has been renamed Coldwell Banker Icon.\nThis latest local move comes a week after Compass and Coldwell Banker parent Anywhere Real Estate closed on their\n$4.2 billion merger\n. The combined business of the nation\u2019s two largest brokerages now counts about 340,000 agents \u2014 and growing.\nThe newest addition, Coldwell Banker Icon, plans to open a South Orange County office by the end of the month and another in Rancho Cucamonga, about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, Rodriguez told\nThe Real Deal\n. The Inland Empire office will be established through the acquisition of an existing company that, if finalized, will add another 60 agents to the roster. The details of both offices will be disclosed once those moves are finalized.\n\u201cI get to be independent still, but now I\u2019ve got this 120-year-old brand behind me that\u2019s recognizable,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI thought, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\nRodriguez launched Cal American Homes around 2009 with an office in Rancho Cucamonga at a time when the region was still reeling from the subprime mortgage meltdown. About three years ago, he decided to move the business to Real Brokerage\u2019s digital platform. With the market becoming more rugged last year, being virtual wasn\u2019t working for his agents. After exploring \u201ctraditional brands\u201d for nearly a year, Rodriguez and Juarez decided to link with Coldwell Banker.\n\u201cI just loved it. It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s luxurious, yet the common person knows the brand,\u201d Rodriguez said, and the then-pending merger with Compass didn\u2019t give him pause. \u201cThis is all at the same time we\u2019re hearing about Compass is going to buy Anywhere and what does that mean? I don\u2019t care what it means. I like Coldwell Banker. I like their leadership. I like their brand. I like their messaging.\u201d\nThe establishment of Coldwell Banker Icon is the latest deal to quickly add scale to Coldwell Banker\u2019s Southern California ranks. But, it is small relative to the franchise agreement the Anywhere Real Estate brand struck in November with a\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\nfranchisee.\nThat deal late last year renamed the BHHSCP affiliate Coldwell Banker Envision and added over 1,300 agents and 14 offices in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties.\nIn 2025, that affiliate business was\nranked sixth\nin Los Angeles County with volume of $2.4 billion in on-market deals within Los Angeles County between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, according to\nTRD Data\n.\nThe franchise agreement did not include BHHSCP\u2019s company-owned business or three other franchisees in Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach and San Luis Obispo.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Chicago hotel owners won strong backing from City Hall this week for a plan to tax themselves, in an effort to juice tourism spending and give the city a louder marketing megaphone.\nMembers of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Finance Committee praised a proposal Tuesday to create a new Tourism Improvement District that would add a 1.5 percent surcharge to hotel stays at downtown properties. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the committee voted to schedule a Feb. 27 public hearing \u2014 the final procedural step before the panel and the full City Council take a formal vote on creating the district.\nIf approved, the\nsurcharge\nwould stack on top of Chicago\u2019s existing 17.5 percent combined city and state\nhotel tax\n, pushing the total levy on downtown hotel rooms to about 19 percent \u2014 the highest in the nation, according to the outlet. Aldermen framed the move as a rare example of an industry volunteering to shoulder a new tax rather than asking the city to spread the pain elsewhere.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking one for the team here,\u201d said Alderman Brian Hopkins. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is supporting the entire hospitality sector and tourism industry.\u201d\nThe proposal has been championed by Choose Chicago and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, which argue that hotel tax revenue meant to support tourism has increasingly been siphoned off to general city needs. IHLA President and CEO\nMichael Jacobson\ntold aldermen at the meeting that money generated by hotel taxes has \u201ceroded,\u201d as it\u2019s been diverted to infrastructure, general funds and other priorities.\nUnder the plan, the new surcharge would generate an estimated $40 million a year, money that would be controlled by downtown hotel owners and\nChoose Chicago\n. That would more than double the tourism agency\u2019s current annual budget of roughly $33 million, giving it more firepower to compete for conventions, trade shows and leisure travelers in an increasingly crowded national marketplace, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThis is simply allowing Chicago to level the playing field, particularly with our major competitive markets,\u201d Jacobson said, noting that more than 200 markets nationwide already use tourism improvement districts.\nChicago welcomed about 55.3 million visitors in 2024, up 6.5 percent from the year before, but still short of the 61.6 million tourists who came in 2019, according to the publication.\nThe district would initially run for five years before requiring renewal. Several aldermen expressed appreciation \u2014 and some surprise \u2014 that hotel owners are backing the added cost.\n\u201cNot a lot of people come and say, \u2018Please tax us for more,\u2019\u201d said Alderman Andre Vasquez.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Michael N. Lerner and his partners offloaded a newly built Uptown apartment complex for $21.4 million, as a bitter legal battle between the developer and his prominent Chicago real estate family has reached a ceasefire.\nA New York-based investment group acquired the 57-unit\nHarmony Apartments at 4511 North Clark Street\n, according to Essex Realty Group, which brokered the deal. The sale lands roughly $1.1 million below the $22.5 million asking price outlined in the property\u2019s listing materials. Essex\u2019s Jordan Gottlieb and Rick Ofman represented the sellers.\nThe sale has not yet hit public records, and the buyer\u2019s identity is not disclosed.\nWhile Essex touted the deal as a win for the Sheridan Park area of Uptown, the transaction plays out against the backdrop of a messy, years-long feud between Lerner and his parents, including Michael J. Lerner, the head of prolific multifamily firm\nMCZ Development\n.\nThe younger Lerner had been entangled in a\nweb of litigation\nwith his parents, who accused him of mismanaging funds and failing to repay loans tied to various projects. Those disputes, which at one point led to the appointment of a receiver to manage some of the family\u2019s contested assets, have started to wind down, with a handful of lawsuits settled in 2025, online court records show.\nBut it\u2019s unclear from public documents if the disposal of the Clark Street property was mandated by those settlements, or if any proceeds will be funneled back to the parental trust that fueled much of the finger-pointing and litigation. The trust alleged that the son\nspent well above his means\nby putting family companies and entities on the hook for debts he took on without sharing loan proceeds, among other purported breaches of contracts.\nThe younger Lerner co-owned the Uptown property with investors Stan and Eugene Bernshteyn, records show, though it\u2019s unclear how much equity each had in the development. The sellers and their representatives didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney for the parental Lerner trust.\nThe deal follows a string of\ndistress and liquidations\nfor Michael N. Lerner. In November, a separate foreclosure case brought by Fannie Mae against him was resolved through the $9.5 million sale of the Chicago collateral property to an entity tied to William Gold\u2019s locally based real estate firm GPO Development Group.\nIn 2023, a high-profile skirmish between Lerner and his father over a\n$35 million Fulton Market development site deal\nwas also resolved through a legal settlement, following the sale to Miami-based developer Crescent Heights.\nFor the Uptown buyer, the acquisition yields a stabilized building in a supply-constrained pocket of the North Side. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthe buyer owns another multifamily property purchased somewhat recently in Chicago.\nCompleted in 2024, the Harmony building includes 56 apartments and ground-floor commercial space occupied by the Black Ensemble Theater.\nMarketing materials for the property projected a 2025 net operating income of about $1.47 million. The retail space, though, had the nonprofit theater organization on a rent abatement that ran through July, according to marketing materials.\nStill, the Black Ensemble Theater is bringing far more value just a block away: Chicago\u2019s Plan Commission last year approved the nonprofit\u2019s Performing Arts Education and Media Technology Center for the property at 4450 North Clark Street, a $76 million complex that will include educational and performance spaces, media and commercial spaces, 53 affordable apartments and parking.\n",

The property is located at 7th Street and Castro Street between Interstate 880 and 960 and is owned by real estate investors Frank and Daphne Yang. A list price has not been disclosed.\nThe 7th and Castro site is zoned for commercial and residential uses with a maximum of 278 units and eight stories. A developer could buy the location and take advantage of the state\u2019s\naffordable housing density bonus\nto increase the unit and height limitations significantly depending on how many affordable units are built.\nIn 2021, developer Wise Investments Enterprise\nsubmitted a pre-application\nto build a 24-story residential tower with 400 to 500 units at the site, San Francisco YIMBY reported at the time. In order to qualify for the state density bonus, the project designated 15 percent of the apartments units as affordable housing, which also allowed the height maximum to increase 190 feet higher than what zoning rules would normally allow. Previous renderings from\nWalnut Creek\n-based LCA Architects showed a four-story parking garage in the building, but the proposal appears to be inactive, according to the Business Times.\nThe 600 Castro site is subject to an S-14 housing overlay zone because it is listed in the city\u2019s housing element, thus guaranteeing the parcel will be used for housing. It also ensures ministerial design review for the project. The site is in a federal opportunity zone, which offers investors tax benefits to promote investment in certain communities as a way of increasing economic growth and job creation.\nThe area around 600 Castro has seen various proposals for housing arise in recent years. At the\n55-acre Howard Terminal site\n, the Oakland Athletics\npreviously floated\nbuilding a new baseball stadium as well as housing and commercial space before the team left town in 2024. An empty lot at 500 Kirkham Street in West Oakland was once entitled for 1,032 housing units, but was seized by its lender in 2023 and put\non the market\nat a $5 million bargain-basement price last fall, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Denver-based DoubleBay Partners and Chicago-based Midloch Investment Partners sold the property. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Mark Thiel and Cory Gross brokered the transaction.\nDoubleBay and Midloch purchased the building in May 2025 for $3.9 million.

The acquisition was made using Midloch\u2019s Midloch Value Fund II, which closed in 2023 after\nraising $60 million\nfrom investors, the Milwaukee Business Journal reported at the time.\nThe Fox Creek Marketplace building was formerly occupied by a\nSafeway\nsupermarket and was \u201cin distress\u201d when it last sold \u201cat a discount,\u201d Andy Sinclair, CEO of Midloch Investment Partners, said in a statement, according to the Business Journal. That distress at the time presumably led to the bargain-basement price of $3.9 million.\nThe former Safeway space has since been transformed into a Vasa Fitness gym with the help of Denver-based construction company, which led the entitlement, permitting and conversion of the anchor tenant space.

        "content": "Homebuilders across North Texas spent much of 2025 pulling back on new construction as demand softened and inventory piled up in what\u2019s increasingly a buyer\u2019s market.\nThat\u2019s according to new data issued in a report from Residential Strategies, a residential market research company. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat builders in the Dallas-Fort Worth area started construction on 8,386 homes in the fourth quarter, down 17.7 percent from 10,190 in the same period of the prior year. For the full year, starts totaled 41,222 for-sale homes, a 12.3 percent drop from 46,991 in 2024, according to RSI data.\n\u201cIt is very clear that builder profits will be much lower in 2026 compared to 2025, as DFW remains a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Ted Wilson, a principal at Residential Strategies, wrote in the analysis.\nThe resale market hasn\u2019t offered much relief. Existing home sales in North Texas inched up 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending November, even as listings jumped more than 12 percent to 32,300, according to the Texas A&amp;M Real Estate Center.\nThe slowdown reflects a broader cooling in the region\u2019s economic tailwinds. Job growth in DFW weakened sharply last year, with the metro adding just 18,000 net new jobs in 2025, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. That\u2019s a far cry from the roughly 95,000 jobs that were added each year in the metroplex between 2010 and 2023.\nBuilders\nare also staring at a\nglut of land\n. North Texas ended 2025 with about 110,000 vacant developed lots and another 68,000\nlots in the development pipeline\n, Residential Strategies said.\nThe firm noted early signs of increased traffic heading into 2026, which may not translate cleanly into profits, and fourth quarter prospective buyer traffic leveled off at the end of 2025.\n\u201cBuilders have been able to sell to a backlog of pent-up demand in DFW, but affordability challenges have required price discounting, rate buy-downs, and other incentives,\u201d Wilson said in the report, cutting into margins.\nAt year-end, DFW had 12,317 finished vacant homes, slightly up from the prior quarter, reinforcing\nbuilders\u2019 decisions\nto slow starts while trimming prices on standing inventory. Closings followed the same trajectory. Builders closed on 10,473 homes in the fourth quarter, down 5.5 percent, year-over-year. For all of 2025, closings fell to about 45,000, compared with nearly 48,000 in 2024, according to the data.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Despite the show\u2019s name, the property is in the ritzy neighborhood of Brentwood.\nIt\u2019s the first time in 48 years the mansion has been up for sale. The two-story home was built in 1937 and features six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. The home spans approximately 10,000 square feet and the corner lot itself is 38,510 square feet. The home\u2019s actual footprint is smaller than the fictional Banks family abode on the show, which was said to have 10 bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.\nWhoever buys the house would move into a neighborhood popular among stars.

        "content": "The fiefdoms of Dallas already survived a Compass campaign. One reigning firm is fortifying its ramparts as Compass\ngrows even larger\n.\nKeith Conlon, the CEO of homegrown Dallas luxury brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, recently acquired an ownership stake in the firm in an\nequity investment deal\nwith its parent company, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based HomeServices of America. The deal aims to keep the company\u2019s center of authority local as\nCompass\ngathers more teams under its banner after its merger with Anywhere Real Estate was finalized earlier this month.\nThe deal also aims to preserve the variety of Dallas\u2019 luxury market, as other Texas markets fuse under\nCompass and its affiliated companies\n.\nBrands founded in Dallas dominate the market. It\u2019s the only city of the state\u2019s three top luxury markets in which the\nbiggest sale of the year\nwas represented by agents outside of Compass or the brands under its umbrella. Two Allie Beth Allman agents negotiated the sale of\n6601 Hunters Glen Road\nin Dallas for $30.5 million, the state\u2019s most expensive residential sale of 2025. Meanwhile, Compass had both sides of the sale for\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\nin Houston, asking $18.9 million, and Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey represented both parties in the sale of\n13330 Shore Vista Drive in Austin\n.\nIt\u2019s not just the biggest sale of the year. Of the top 10 deals in the Metroplex last year, a minority involved a Compass agent, and most involved an agent with one of several Dallas-based brands: Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday Realtors, Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate or Synergy Real Estate. Alongside Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday and Dave Perry-Miller, which are also owned by HomeServices of America, had agents on more than one deal. Dallas firms Brexen and Rogers Healy crop up more in lower-range listings.\nThat\u2019s not the case in Austin or Houston.\nAustin is as varied a market as Dallas, but not with locally-founded brands. Coldwell Banker, Engel &amp; Volkers, Christie\u2019s International and eXp Realty all landed on the Travis County leaderboard last year alongside Compass, Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and Moreland Properties, Compass\u2019 most significant local competitor in the Austin market. Moreland is the only local brokerage with an agent on more than one of the top 10 deals.\n\u201cAll of our key competitors are typically Compass, Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s. You know, these bigger brands that are all franchises and basically\nnow all owned by Compass\n,\u201d said Sarah Railey, president and broker of Moreland Properties.\nMeanwhile, Compass rules Houston. Just one of the top 10 residential deals inked in Houston last year did not involve a Compass agent: the sale of a home at\n3996 Inverness Drive\n, represented on both sides of the deal by Nancy Almodovar, founder of Nan &amp; Co.\nAt the top echelon of Houston\u2019s residential market, Nan &amp; Co has no other consistent competition apart from Compass, Almodovar claimed.\n\u201cWhen we go pitch to a luxury listing, it\u2019s typically just Compass and us,\u201d Almodovar said.\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, Nan &amp; Co and Moreland Properties all weathered a Compass recruitment blitz in 2018 and 2019 that significantly dented other groups.\nNan &amp; Co lost no agents to Compass in 2018, but plenty of other brokerages did. Some \u201cshut down,\u201d according to Almodovar.\nIn Austin, Moreland Properties \u201cchose not to entertain a meeting\u201d with Compass about joining the company, Railey said.\n\u201cCompass would come in and buy companies, not necessarily shutter them,\u201d Railey said.\nAllie Beth Allman, which fields about 400 agents,\nreportedly\nlost 35 agents to Compass then, a third of what Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s lost.\n\u201cThey did a great job of getting some of the top people in the city,\u201d Conlon said.\nHe\u2019s optimistic the equity investment deal will help preserve local control in the increasing homogeneous luxury brokerage world.\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is hamstring our organization because things aren\u2019t going well in Northern California or New York, wherever it may be,\u201d Conlon said.\n",

        "content": "GL Homes\nis doubling down on Westlake, snapping up a major chunk of one of Palm Beach County\u2019s fastest-growing master-planned communities.\nThe Sunrise-based homebuilder bought 220 acres in\nWestlake\nfor $40 million this week, public records show. That\u2019s $182,000 per acre. The builder plans to acquire another tract for $40 million next year, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMinto Communities USA, Westlake\u2019s master developer, was the seller.\nThe acquisition gives GL Homes control of one of the largest undeveloped tracts in the county, as residential and commercial development continues to push westward. Housing, retail and civic amenities have taken shape in Westlake, said Misha Ezratti, GL\u2019s president.\nGL Homes plans to combine the newly acquired land with a 120-acre site it already owns in the city, creating a development footprint large enough for more than 1,000 homes. The builder bought the 120-acre parcel for $29.4 million in 2024 and later completed a land swap with Minto to make the site contiguous, Ezratti said.\nDesign work for the community is still underway, and GL Homes has not yet disclosed the mix of homes or pricing.\nWestlake spans about 3,800 acres and is entitled for 4,500 homes and 2 million square feet of commercial space. Multiple builders are active in the city. The community includes a water park, skate park and sports courts.\nThe deal further cements GL Homes\u2019 growing presence in northwest Palm Beach County. The builder previously developed homes at Arden, south of Westlake, and controls the nearby 5,000-acre Indian Trails site, which is entitled for just under 4,000 homes.\nLarge\u2011scale master\u2011planned projects dominate development activity in the area. They include Minto\u2019s 4,800\u2011acre\nAvenir\ncommunity in Palm\u202fBeach Gardens, which includes nearly 4,000 homes, a hotel, medical offices, retail space and a 2,400\u2011acre nature preserve.\nDevelopers such as Minto and Lennar are investing heavily in the area, but face infrastructure limits and increasing scrutiny from municipalities concerned about preserving\nhome\u2011rule authority over zoning\n.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It\u2019s clear who the losers are in Houston\u2019s\nwave of multifamily distress\n, but it hasn\u2019t yet been obvious how to cash in on the cycle.\nRREAF Holdings\u2019 latest buy provides a template. The Dallas-based investor picked up 2828 at Royal Oaks, a 510-unit garden-style apartment complex at 2828 Hayes Road in Westchase, according to a press release. Deed records show RREAF bought the property after its previous owner lost it to foreclosure.\nMinneapolis-based AB CarVal Investors took control of the property in August in a $20 million credit bid after Wilbraham, Massachusetts-based Colony Hills Capital allegedly defaulted on the $65.2 million loan tied to the property, deed records show. RREAF partnered with Axonic Capital to buy it from AB CarVal Investors for an undisclosed price.\nColony Hills Capital bought the property in 2021 as multifamily investors swept through Texas, picking up aging apartment buildings, with plans to fix them up, raise rents and sell them at a profit. Interest rates blew up their business plans, and many of these investors started losing properties to foreclosure in 2024.\nAs another layer in this distressed multifamily sale, the former owner partnered with Maverick County Housing Finance Corporation (HFC) to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Colony Hills Capital sold the property to Maverick County HFC, an affordable housing organization 330 miles from Houston, and leased the ground.\nIn the 2025 legislative session,\nGov. Greg Abbott signed a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors. Some municipalities took the passage of HB 21 as justification to revoke property tax credits for these deals, although the law provides operators time to come into compliance.\nThe loss of these tax credits has\nexacerbated the wave of distress\nhitting Texas multifamily properties. Houston has been hit particularly hard; for the last year,\nHouston multifamily\nprojects have made up the majority of loans tied to commercial real estate that hit the foreclosure auction block in Texas. In January, troubled\nHouston multifamily loans made up $198 million\nof the $826 million tied to properties across the Texas Triangle headed to auction, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nRREAF is picking up where Colony Hills Capital left off.\nThe new owner plans to rebrand the property built in 1995 as Aura Westchase, with 37 percent of units scheduled for renovation this year. The revamp will also include new signage and upgraded amenities.\nThe purchase adds to RREAF\u2019s 2,000-unit Houston multifamily portfolio. It was RREAF\u2019s third distressed multifamily purchase of 2025 and its first purchase with Axonic Capital, according to the release.\n",

The arbitrator ordered Maidman to pay $22 million in damages.\nResles\u2019 attorney, David Feuerstein, characterized the conduct as \u201ctantamount to theft\u201d and has now filed a lawsuit in New York County Supreme Court to enforce the award.\nAn attorney for Maidman declined to comment to Crain\u2019s.\nCourt records indicate that Maidman transferred seven penthouses to an entity that included his family but excluded Resles, took out loans secured by those units and kept the proceeds. He also arranged for the jointly owned company to issue more than $20 million in interest\u2011free loans to Maidman\u2011controlled entities, while simultaneously collecting an 8.7 percent preferred return for managing the property.\nResles\u2019 firm, Oxford Capital, said the maneuvers drained so much cash from the project that it never made a single dollar in distributions.\nThe ruling marks a significant setback for Maidman, whose family has been active in New York real estate since 1933 and owns about 1,000\nrental units\nthrough its Townhouse Management Company, where Mitchel Maidman serves as CEO. Holdings include a Chelsea hotel and Upper East Side townhouses.\nThe family previously controlled a long\u2011vacant West 42nd Street site before the Durst Organization ultimately took over and developed the Bank of America Tower.\nMurray Hill, on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, has become a hotbed for residential development, including a\n157-unit project\nfrom Brause Realty and a 137-unit luxury\ncondo development\nfrom Continuum Company.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

The eight-bedroom, 10-bathroom and three half-bathroom house was completed last year. It sits on a 1.2-acre lot.\nMas, who Forbes estimates is worth about $3.5 billion, has been buying and selling homes under the radar for years. A quit-claim deed transfer of ownership for the Casuarina Concourse sale was recorded in late December without a price, but a source told\nThe Real Deal\nMas paid $75 million for the property.\nThat price marks a record for Coral Gables. Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion at 340 Leucadendra Drive\nfor $55 million,\nwhich set a new record at the time,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nAttorney Roland Sanchez-Medina signed the deed on behalf of the seller, records show. Mas\u2019 ownership is hidden via a land trust.\nIn December, a\ntrust owned by Mas\nand his wife sold the 13,500-square-foot home at 6312 Riviera Drive to a land trust managed by attorney Richard Barbara.\nAround the same time, he sold the\n7.3-acre residential lot\noff of Douglas Road in the Grove to a hidden buyer, sources previously told\nTRD\n. That off-market trade was not recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown. Sources said Mas purchased the waterfront lot this year and flipped it. His purchase was not recorded, and it suggests that he acquired the LLC that owned the lot.\nIn addition to his role at MasTec, Mas is also managing owner of\nInter Miami CF\n, the Major League Soccer team part-owned by David Beckham. Inter Miami is building its mixed-use soccer complex near Miami International Airport.\nBillionaire buyers have been increasingly active since early December, residential brokers say.\nSome prospective buyers are driven by the proposed wealth tax in California. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, recently paid about\n$173 million\nfor two homes in Coconut Grove, including the 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way, and the 10,400-square-foot mansion at 3085 Munroe Drive.\n",

The structure occupies a full block, bound north and south by California and Pine streets, with Davis and Front streets to east and west.\nHines recently put $75 million into a ground-floor renovation\nthat upgraded the outdoor plaza and added a cafe and lounge. That project, drawn up before the pandemic, was completed in 2023.\nThe property still carries a $755 million loan that comes due in 2029. As of September 2025, the building was 82 percent occupied, according to Morningstar Credit.\nAccording to the source, the deal has not yet closed. It is unclear how much of the property DivcoWest has purchased. GIC owns the majority stake, and Texas\u2013based developer Hines \u2014 who developed the property in 1982, and still manages the asset \u2014 owns a less than 10 percent stake.\nDivcoWest manages more than 24 million square feet of real estate assets, worth about $18 billion, across the U.S. Its properties include 540 Madison Ave, a 39-story office tower in Manhattan, and 300 and 301 Howard St in San Francisco, a pair of buildings that contain more than 730,000 square feet of office space in the SOMA neighborhood. The company also holds property in cities such as Austin, Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston.\nThe 101 California tower\nhit the market late last year\nat $900 per square foot, giving the skyscraper a roughly $1.1 billion valuation, a price that was widely viewed as the best test to date of the appetite for prime property in San Francisco. The city struggled to rebound after the pandemic but has appeared to hit a vein of gold once again as the center of gravity for the artificial intelligence industry. San Francisco still carries a nearly 33 percent office vacancy rate, but\ndemand has surged and 2025 marked the best office leasing year\nfor the city since 2019, with 10.2 million square feet of leases signed, according to CBRE.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely off the bottom\u201d of the market, Colin Yasukochi, head of CBRE\u2019s tech arm, told\nThe Real Deal.\nHe called 101 California \u201cone of the most prominent buildings\u201d and that \u201cany renewed investment or commitment to staking space in that building does make a mark.\u201d\nStill, even the $900 per square foot price proposed by the sellers of 101 California, falls below its 2018 valuation of more than $1.4 billion \u2014 nearly $1,200 per square foot.\nDespite the rush for high-quality office space \u2014 almost 90% of San Francisco office leases in the fourth quarter of 2025 were in Class A buildings \u2014 major trades in the city\u2019s trophy market have been minimal in San Francisco since the pandemic. One private equity executive told\nThe Real Deal\nthat, despite the AI boom, borrowing money remains tough for office investments.\n\u201cThe opportunities in San Francisco are probably to get a piece of trophy space, like 101 California, or go buy a class B building and spend a ton of money to make it an attractive and competitive office space,\u201d the executive said.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Larry Page is doubling down on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley \u2014 even as he tries to move one of his startups\u2019 headquarters to Texas.\nDynatomics, a three-year-old AI venture backed by the Google co-founder, filed paperwork to shift the company\u2019s headquarters \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 out of California. On Dec. 30, Page submitted documents to the California Secretary of State converting Dynatomics LLC to an address in Keller, Texas, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAt the same time,\nPage\nleased 73,400 square feet at a newly redeveloped research and development project in Palo Alto, according to CBRE. The company focuses on AI-powered manufacturing and design tools for advanced aircraft. According to the outlet, Dynatomics is expected to occupy space at The Cannery, a conversion of a former Fry\u2019s Electronics store at 340 Portage Avenue.\nWhether that signals a meaningful operational move is unclear. The Palo Alto lease suggests Dynatomics\u2019 core research and development work will remain planted in Silicon Valley. The new facility is expected to house engineers and technical staff, making a wholesale relocation from California unlikely.\nThe Texas filing instead fits a broader pattern for Page, whose recent maneuvers appear driven more by tax strategy. Ahead of a potential wealth tax headed for California\u2019s ballot in November, Page shifted multiple limited liability companies to lower-tax states, including Florida, according to the New York Times, and also snapped up high-end residential property in Miami.\nThe proposed\nCalifornia Billionaire Tax Act\nwould impose a one-time levy on billionaire wealth to fund health care, education and food assistance programs. Page, ranked No. 75 on Fortune\u2019s list of the most powerful business figures, joins a growing list of tech elites quietly adjusting their corporate domiciles in response, according to the outlet.\nThe Dynatomics deal also lands as demand for research and development space on the San Francisco Peninsula shows early signs of recovery. With new construction largely stalled, more companies moved into research and development space than exited last year for the first time since 2021, CBRE said, though vacancy still hovers near 25 percent. The Cannery has been repositioned for engineering testing and prototype manufacturing and sits near an established EV and advanced manufacturing cluster anchored by Tesla and Rivian.\nThe split strategy mirrors broader AI real estate trends. Elsewhere in Texas, a data center startup co-founded by former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt\nis betting on cheap power and wide- open land in the\nPermian Basin\n. Bolt Data &amp; Energy raised $150 million and struck a partnership with Texas Pacific Land Corporation to develop large-scale AI infrastructure, Bloomberg reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A storied townhouse\u2019s \u201ctortured\u201d sales process may have an end in sight.\nThe palatial Upper East Side home at 15 East 63rd Street, which once served as famed designer Oleg Cassini\u2019s studio, has found a potential buyer, according to a recent court filing.\nThe attempt to sell the home has been followed closely, not just because of Cassini\u2019s reputation for romancing stars like Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly and styling celebrities like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but because of the drama-filled bankruptcy proceedings surrounding the home.\nBut the nearly three-year legal fight over the home appears to be coming to a close after two potential buyers came forward in the last few months of 2025. Chapter 11 trustee Albert Togut filed a motion asking the court to approve a sales procedure that would designate the highest bid, a $34.5 million offer from a buyer shielded by a limited liability corporation, as a stalking horse bid prior to holding an auction on Jan. 28.\nThe filing also seeks to designate a $34.1 million dollar offer from tech entrepreneur Yingkai Xu as back-up bidder, and to exempt the sale from transfer taxes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine there is a reason the court wouldn\u2019t approve this,\u201d Togut told\nThe Real Deal\n, pointing to the difficulties that arose during the sales process.\nThe home was originally scheduled to be sold out of foreclosure before Peggy Nestor, Cassini\u2019s sister-in-law, filed for bankruptcy one day before the sale in April 2023 and agreed to either secure new financing or sell the home.\nNestor and her sister, Marianne Nestor Cassini, who married Oleg Cassini in 1971, had accrued an array of liens on the property prior to Nestor declaring bankruptcy.\nThe largest claim on the home resulted from a 2017 loan provided by Lynx Asset Services that the sisters defaulted on less than a year later. Lynx, which filed the original foreclosure and has provided debtor-in-possession financing during the bankruptcy proceedings, has consented to the sale.\nLynx had called the sales process \u201ctortured\u201d after it took nearly nine months for Nestor to sign an agreement with a broker to market the apartment and another three months before the home was listed for\n$65 million\nby Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe sisters had thwarted sales efforts by barring the Sotheby\u2019s team from staging, photographing or marketing the home, according to a filing from Togut on April 10, 2024. Later that month, with help from the U.S. Marshals Service, the sisters were removed from the home which was discovered to be in \u201cdisarray,\u201d Togut wrote in another filing.\n\u201cUntil today, Sotheby\u2019s was completely frustrated and prevented from doing its work,\u201d Togut wrote.\nBut Togut said the Sotheby\u2019s team failed to bring \u201ceven one\u201d credible buyer, and last January handed the listing over to\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi\n, who re-listed the 18,000-square-foot townhouse for $39.5 million.\nHassoumi has shown the home at least 60 times since then, according to an affidavit he filed as part of Togut\u2019s motion.\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied that by working the property the way we did, we got the highest offer we could get, or anyone could get,\u201d Togut said.\nFeaturing seven bedrooms and more than eight bathrooms, the 25-foot-wide home would be part of a run of ornate Gilded Age homes that have found buyers after years of sitting on the market. Last year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011.\n",

Developed in the early 1990s by Michael Shaoul and Michael Rosen, the building once featured an 18-foot statue of Vladimir Lenin perched atop the roof \u2014 a nod, Rosen once told The New York Times, to the neighborhood\u2019s leftist political leanings.\nThat statue came down in 2016, just before Dermot and Rockwood acquired the property for about $105 million. The new owners refaced the building\u2019s red brick facade in white and invested roughly $20 million in capital improvements, according to marketing materials from JLL, where a team led by Rob Hinckley and Jeff Julien brokered the sale.\nThe acquisition marks another step in Atlas\u2019 New York City expansion. The investment and development firm, founded in 2006 by Jeffrey Goldberger and Andrew Cohen, recently made preferred equity investments in the purchase and pre-development of 175 Third Street and 205 Montague Street in Brooklyn and is co-developing the high-profile\n80 Clarkson Street\nalong with a senior affordable housing complex at 570 Washington Street in Manhattan.\nThe Houston Street building is packed with perks aimed at the neighborhood\u2019s young professionals, from a rooftop and landscaped courtyards to an athletic club and tenant lounge. Roughly three-quarters of the apartments feature private balconies. The building is fully leased, according to StreetEasy.\nAtlas declined to comment.

        "content": "Bally\u2019s Chicago may not hit its long-promised opening date for its permanent casino after all.\nWith the company\u2019s already-extended temporary license to operate at Medinah Temple set to expire in September, state lawmakers are moving to buy Bally\u2019s more time. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat state Representative Kam Buckner introduced legislation Thursday that would allow up to another 12 months of temporary operations while construction continues on Bally\u2019s $1.7 billion casino, hotel and entertainment complex in River West.\nThe bill would effectively push Bally\u2019s deadline to open its permanent facility to as late as September 2027, extending a timeline that has already slipped multiple times.\nBally\u2019s was selected by the city in 2022 to develop the long-awaited casino on the 30-acre former\nTribune Freedom Center\nprinting plant site. The project is slated to include a 500-room hotel, a 3,000-seat theater, an exhibition hall, 10 restaurants and roughly 4,000 gaming positions, making it the largest casino in Illinois.\nBut construction has been anything but smooth. The city halted demolition work at the Freedom Center site in December 2024 after debris spilled into the Chicago River. In May 2025, the Illinois Gaming Board ordered another work stoppage after contractors used an unauthorized waste hauler with alleged\norganized crime ties\n. Last year, Bally\u2019s also had to redesign the site plan and relocate the 34-story hotel tower to avoid damaging water management infrastructure along the river.\nThose setbacks have steadily eroded the project\u2019s schedule.\nBally\u2019s\nhad long targeted a September 2026 opening, aligned with the expiration of its temporary license. That date was later pushed to the fourth quarter of 2026. Even that timeline, the Illinois Gaming Board has said, would require legislative action to keep the Medinah Temple casino open in the interim.\nBuckner\u2019s bill would extend the temporary license by six months, with the option for two additional three-month extensions while construction wraps up. Buckner\u2019s 26th District includes Medinah Temple, where\nBally\u2019s\nhas been operating since September 2023, according to the publication.\nThe stakes are high for both Bally\u2019s and City Hall. The permanent casino is expected to generate far more revenue than the temporary setup, which has underperformed projections.\nBally\u2019s Chicago\nranked fifth statewide last year, posting about $125 million in adjusted gross receipts and 1.3 million visitors, according to Gaming Board data.\nThat muted performance comes as Illinois casino revenue overall is surging. The state\u2019s 17 casinos generated more than $1.9 billion in adjusted gross receipts in 2025, up 15 percent, year-over-year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In Santa Clara County, 76 rooms were under construction last year, representing an 86.4 percent drop from 557 hotel rooms in 2024. Alameda County had 234 rooms under construction in 2025, down 48.1 percent year over year; and an estimated 115 rooms were under construction in Contra Costa County in 2025, a 52.3 percent decline from 2024. San Mateo County stayed even with 92 hotel rooms in the pipeline.\nNapa County, on the other hand, saw an uptick in the number of hotel rooms being built from 2024 to 2025. Last year, 626 rooms were under construction \u2014 a 138.6 percent increase from the 262 rooms in Napa County in 2024. The region remains a popular tourism destination for its world-famous vineyards.\nSales of hotel properties\n, rather than construction of new buildings, have become increasingly popular, especially as a wave of\nloan defaults\nand\nforeclosures\nacross the Bay Area send hotel values plummeting. \u201cHotel developers are really being impacted by the number of existing hotels that are available for sale at prices that are well below their replacement costs,\u201d Reay said. \u201cPrices are so low for hotels that the economics don\u2019t work for new construction.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sales are moving briskly at The Modern Austin Residences, and the developer of the newly completed downtown tower has locked in fresh financing.\nAustin-based Urbanspace Development has now sold more than half the market-rate condos at the 56-story mixed-use tower at 610 Davis Street in the\nRainey Street Historic District\n, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns told the outlet that the strong pace helped the firm secure a recapitalization of its construction loan now that the building is complete, giving Urbanspace more breathing room as it finishes selling out the project.\nBurns said sales momentum has accelerated since Thanksgiving, a notable bright spot in an otherwise sluggish\ncondo market\nacross Austin. Urbanspace already closed on more than half the tower\u2019s market-rate units, which range from roughly 600 square feet to 6,000 square feet, with one to five bedrooms. The 319-unit building also includes 20 affordable workforce housing condos. The market-rate units range in price from the $400,000s to upwards of $5 million, and the penthouses begin at $9.2 million according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe refinancing was structured through a joint venture between Peregren Capital Group and Koch Real Estate Investments, with senior financing provided by Axos Bank, according to a release. A JLL Capital Markets team led by Senior Managing Director Doug Opalka represented Urbanspace in the deal.\nOpalka said that the refinancing shows strength and confidence in Austin\u2019s luxury residential market, pointing to the project\u2019s location and design as key drivers.\nThe Modern\u2019s performance stands out amid a\nbroader slowdown\nin condo development and sales citywide. Burns said the tower may be the last new downtown Austin condo project completed this decade, as rising costs, tighter financing and softer demand push many proposed projects to the sidelines or keep them stuck in early planning stages.\nThat caution is already showing up elsewhere in Urbanspace\u2019s orbit. Construction on Northland Living\u2019s Luminary condo tower\ndowntown\n, for which Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales, was originally slated to begin in late 2026 but has been paused until market conditions improve, according to the publication. Endeavor Real Estate Group is also taking a wait-and-see approach with a planned condo project at West Sixth Street and North Lamar Boulevard.\nMarket data underscores the chill. Austin-based Team Price Real Estate reported that December condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units, while sale prices have been trending downward.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties was confirmed as the buyer of 5,151 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group in a Friday hearing. Pinnacle, run by Joel Wiener, placed the apartments in bankruptcy. Summit will pay $451.3 million for the portfolio.\nThe hearing marks the end of a weekslong battle, with Pinnacle and Summit on one side and the Mamdani administration and tenants on the other. The latter group tried unsuccessfully to stop, pause and delay the sale, hoping for a tenant-aligned bidder or concessions from Summit.\nBankruptcy judge David Jones considered their argument that Summit had not adequately made assurances that it could perform as the buyer and fix up the portfolio. But ultimately he decided to confirm the purchase, after Flagstar Bank agreed hours into the hearing to extend a $3 million revolving line of credit to Summit.\nThe result highlights the challenges ahead for the Mamdani administration as it tries to throw its weight between private transactions. But it also shows that landlords are living in a new New York: one where the mayor can make their portfolios into political problems, and potentially win even minor concessions.\n\u201cSummit\u2019s statements make clear its commitment to do what is needed,\u201d Judge Jones said. \u201cThe city\u2019s approach to this case gives me confidence that the city will monitor and police Sumit\u2019s performance.\u201d\nSummit purchased the mostly rent-stabilized portfolio for $451.3 million, or roughly $88,000 per unit. Flagstar Bank, the largest creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings, agreed to finance about 75 percent of the acquisition and lower the interest rate.\nThe city first raised concerns about the auction during the Adams administration, when the housing department asked for time for a \u201cpreservation-focused\u201d buyer to put together a bid.\nBut Mamdani raised the profile of the sale and made the auction a political rallying point. His administration originally asked to delay the auction, but\nthe judge rejected that effort\n. At the hearing, the city and tenants\u2019 lawyers raised questions about Summit\u2019s financial wherewithal to cure violations, history as a property owner, and limited experience running real estate in New York.\nBut Judge Jones sided with Summit, saying the company had fielded a \u201cserious and reasonable sounding plan\u201d to improve property conditions.\nSummit chair Zohar Levy said the company plans to spend $10 million in the first year fixing violations and addressing maintenance needs, with $3 million specifically on existing violations. It plans on addressing half the violations in the first two months of the sale and the other half within six months of the sale. Within five years, the company plans to spend $30 million in capital expenditures, or about $5,824 per unit.\nAlthough the city raised concerns that Summit\u2019s current New York properties have thousands of violations, Levy said at the hearing that the company is just a limited partner in those properties and would have greater oversight of the new portfolio. REM Management has been engaged to manage part of the portfolio.\nJudge Jones said Flagstar\u2019s promise of a revolving $3 million line of credit was a \u201cvaluable and helpful\u201d commitment.\nIt\u2019s a mixed result for the Mamdani camp\u2019s first big tussle with private landlords. The administration was unsuccessful in its original goal of stopping the sale and bringing on a nonprofit or tenant-focused buyer. But it was also able to slightly alter the terms of the transaction in a large multifamily portfolio purchase.\nIn a statement, Levy said he understood that the process had been difficult for tenants and that they are concerned about their homes.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a new chapter, and we look forward to working with the City, our elected officials, stakeholders and residents to improve the buildings and move forward,\u201d Levy said in the statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are assembling a strong team and have the capacity, commitment and resources to succeed for everyone\u2019s benefit.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Pinnacle Group noted that the judge\u2019s decision is the end result of an eight-month public process. \u201cThe company, its independent chief restructuring officers and advisors appreciate the court\u2019s recognition that this outcome, achieved in challenging circumstances, is the best available for all constituencies, and hopes the City does too,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe Union of Pinnacle Tenants, which represents a portion of tenants in the buildings, decried the result as a decision in favor of slumlords. But the group said that they would continue to organize for repairs from Summit and for an end to harassment. The group in part credited the Mamdani administration for its speedy intervention in the case.\n\u201cWe will fight this next fight knowing that the City and Mayor Mamdani have our backs \u2014 not just in this auction, but in the long-term,\u201d the UPT said in a statement. \u201cBecause we organized, tenants across the city heard us.\u201d\nThe city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\n",

The comedian bought the estate from Hollywood producer Brian Grazer, who paid $7.6 million for the parcel in 2012 and completed construction of the main residence three years later.

        "content": "Landlord Josh Gotlib\nsays a \u201csecret recording\u201d made by his partner\u2019s widow debunks her\naccusation\nthat she was tricked into signing over her late husband\u2019s interests in their real estate business.\nNatalia Legg \u2014 the widow of Black Spruce co-founder Oliver Legg \u2014\u00a0 sued Gotlib and his company Black Spruce Management in 2023 claiming that Gotlib tricked her into signing transfer agreements handing over her husband\u2019s shares.\nOliver Legg died of cancer in May 2015 at the age of 43. Following his death, Natalia was planning to return to Switzerland with her daughter to live there. At that point, she claimed, Gotlib took over control of Black Spruce and the family trust where Oliver had placed his membership interests for the benefit of his wife and daughter.\nNatalia said Gotlib told her that the assets in the trust were losing money, and that as a fiduciary he wanted to move them out of the trust. But she claimed that he actually wanted to move them to benefit himself.\nShe said he invited her to dinner to sign transfer agreements to ratify the move.\n\u201cShortly before Natalia left New York, Gotlib invited Natalia to dinner at his home. Casually, Gotlib produced the transfer agreements and told Natalia that she needed to sign them before she left New York with her daughter only shortly thereafter,\u201d her attorneys wrote in her complaint. \u201cSeizing on Natalia\u2019s vulnerability, Gotlib employed deception and false reassurance to trick Natalia into quickly signing the transfer agreements.\u201d\nNatalia said she had no knowledge of the transfer agreements before the dinner. But now Gotlib says that Natalia was fully aware of what she was signing, and he says that he has proof.\nIn a new filing, Gotlib\u2019s attorneys say that in discovery they obtained a \u201csecret recording\u201d Natalia made at the office of her lawyers at Kramer Levin in May 2015. The recording shows, he claims, that Natalia\u2019s attorneys explained to her that Oliver had agreed that Gotlib would take over management of the money-losing assets.\n\u201cFor this particular assignment [Gotlib] is going to have me, my firm, draw up the necessary agreements to commemorate what he and Oliver had agreed to because then we\u2019re reducing it to writing, because he needs that to administer the trust properly,\u201d the recording said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why that\u2019s happening.\u201d\nGotlib said that the recording shows that Legg\u2019s central argument \u2014 that Gotlib lied and tricked her at a dinner \u2014 is wrong. He also says that since she was aware of the agreements in 2015, the time to file a lawsuit under the statute of limitations has expired.\nGotlib filed a motion to have the case thrown out.\nOne of Natalia\u2019s attorneys, Nate Goralnik from Quinn Emanuel, disputed Gotlib\u2019s interpretation of the recording. He said that the case belongs in arbitration, and that Gotlib\u2019s motion was a ploy to try and divert the case back into court and into the public eye.\n\u201cThe whole motion reeks of an attempt to make this about what the lawyers did or what they should have done, instead of what the case is about,\u201d he said.\nBut Gotlib attorney Todd Soloway of Pryor Cashman said that Natlia put the issue in the court when she filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cThe case would\u2019ve never seen the light of day but for the misstatements made to the court about Natalia Legg\u2019s awareness of the transactions that were being effectuated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe secret recording proves that.\u201d\nBlack Spruce is one of the largest multifamily landlords in Manhattan. The company seemingly came out of nowhere in 2021 when it made headlines for buying the American Copper Buildings for $850 million.\nGotlib followed that up with a deal to buy a portfolio of apartment buildings from the family of the late Sheldon Solow for $1.75 billion in partnership with Meyer Orbach.\nGotlib and Orbach just recently sold a stake in some of the properties to Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR in a deal valuing the buildings at\n$435 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Steve Ross\nis getting in on the private\nmembership club trend\nwith plans for a development in downtown West Palm Beach.\nRelated Ross is partnering with Leisure Resorts LLC, a subsidiary of Hartford, Connecticut-based Chase Enterprises, to build a four-story club on a city-owned parking lot next to the Palm Harbor Marina, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n.\nLeisure Resorts holds a long-term lease on the 1-acre site along the Intracoastal Waterway and operates the marina. The name of the planned club hasn\u2019t been revealed.\nThe project would rise just south of the Waterview Towers condominium at North Flagler Drive and Second Street, across from the Ben hotel, which Related Ross is under contract to buy. It also sits near city-owned waterfront property leased to Elisabetta\u2019s Ristorante and a University of Miami Health System clinic.\nThe lower two floors of the building would include retail space, with two ground-floor restaurants open to the public. The upper floors and rooftop would house a\nmembers-only club\nfeaturing amenities such as a rooftop pool, spa, fitness center and business center. There will be no hotel rooms, said Kenneth Himmel, president of Related Ross.\nPlans cap the building at 75 feet, a height limit established in a 2023 settlement that ended a decade-long lawsuit between Leisure Resorts and Waterview Towers over marina and parking lot control.\nHimmel said the club is designed to meet pent-up demand from Palm Beach and West Palm Beach residents shut out of long-established island clubs by long waitlists and steep initiation fees that can run into the hundreds of thousands \u2014 or more than $1 million at\nMar-a-Lago\n.\nRelated Ross\u2019 club is expected to have more than 500 members and aims to attract people of different ages and interests, including artists, musicians, athletes and families. Himmel described membership pricing as \u201caffordable,\u201d without providing details.The project adds to a growing private-club scene in West Palm Beach, fueled by an influx of wealthy transplants and a surge in business and residential development since the pandemic. Two other private clubs \u2014 Biba Social and the Bellini Rooftop Lounge \u2014 are also in the works downtown, adding to the options for the city\u2019s increasingly affluent population.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

The property is expected to trade for $9.2 million, according to listing agent David Yadegaran of Carolwood. That pencils out to roughly $1,379 per square foot.\nThe Emmy nominee, who is best known for playing Jill Taylor on ABC\u2019s \u201cHome Improvement,\u201d owned the property for almost three decades. She raised her three children there, but with the kids grown, made the decision to downsize to a Los Angeles-area condo and hang up the for-sale sign on the\nBrentwood\nestate, according to Yadegaran.\nRichardson picked up four Emmy nominations during the eight-season run of \u201cHome Improvement,\u201d playing opposite Tim Allen. She also served as an executive producer on the show later in the series, after playing an integral role in shaping episodes from the start, she told the\nLos Angeles Times\nin 2024.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Yadegaran and Shaun Alan-Lee of The Advisory team held the listing. David Berg and F. Ron Smith, founders of Smith &amp; Berg Property Group at Compass, brought the buyer, which was a local family, according to Yadegaran.\nSmith and Berg declined to comment on the buyer through a brokerage spokesperson.\nYadegaran said the property attracted two groups of prospective buyers. One was families looking to build a compound, which encompasses a 1-acre lot that\u2019s shielded from prying eyes with 20-foot hedges and double gates. The other group was developers eyeing the potential upside in such a sizable property.\nThe Cape Code-inspired home has vaulted ceilings in the family room, a primary suite with pool access and a two-bed, two-bath guesthouse. Outdoors there\u2019s room to roam and entertain with gardens, trails, a pool and spa, grotto bar and creek.\nLooking ahead\nIt\u2019s early into 2026, but Yadegaran sees L.A. poised for a ramp in investment and rental\ndealmaking\n.\n\u201cL.A.\u2019s heading in the right direction,\u201d Yadegaran said. \u201cWe have the [FIFA] World Cup coming into town this summer. We have the Olympics in a couple years.\u00a0 The rental market for sure will see a big lift from those events, but a lot of high-end residential is structured in a way more like commercial properties because people look at it as either the equity gain they\u2019re going to have over the course of a number of years, or the income it could generate.\u201d\nVoters are also poised to vote in a new California Insurance Commissioner this November, which Yadegaran also sees as a potential boon for homeowners and real estate broadly.\n\u201cInsurance has been a tightening factor for L.A. over the last few years on top of [Measure]\nULA\n.\u201d Yadegaran said.\n",

        "content": "The beleaguered site of San Francisco\u2019s\nOceanwide Center\ndevelopment has a new owner following a public auction to acquire the paused development plot.\nOn Thursday,\nChinese\nfinancial services firm Haitong\nplaced the winning bid\nfor the location at First and Mission Streets in the Financial District, committing $100 million to foreclose on the nearly 1.3-acre site, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Haitong originated the debt for Oceanwide Center\u2019s developer, Oceanwide Holdings, in 2020, giving the Shanghai-based lender the ability to place a credit bid on the property at auction, meaning the company doesn\u2019t actually have to pay the $100 million to take control of the site.\nWith Haitong having\nseized the Oceanwide parcel\n, the firm is now in position to sell it to the San Francisco Recovery Fund, which\nput down a nonrefundable deposit last month\nto buy the hole in the ground for an estimated $100 million. Haitong placed the only bid for the Oceanwide Center location at the auction on Thursday, though other firms are stakeholders in the property. Those include the project\u2019s general contractor \u2014 a joint venture between firms Swinerton and Webcor \u2014 as well as their subcontractors, which have liens on the property and allege they weren\u2019t paid for work done on Oceanwide Center before construction of the two-tower mixed-use development was halted in 2020 after breaking ground in 2016.\nIt\u2019s likely that Haitong reached some sort of deal with the lien claimants, who previously argued in court that their claim to the Oceanwide site supersedes Haitong\u2019s, a source told the Business Times. If Haitong moves forward with the foreclosure without the claimants\u2019 cooperation, the lien claimants could put a stop to the process entirely, the source said.\nWhether the San Francisco Recovery Fund goes with the approved two-tower project or submits new plans for the site remains to be seen. The Recovery Fund is planning to cement its acquisition of the Oceanwide Center property from Haitong early this year, another source told the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm will pay $150,000 per building. That amount goes up if the landlord fails to make the payment or harasses any tenants.\n\u201cFor years, A&amp;E has operated with callous disregard for those residing in its properties,\u201d Mamdani told reporters. \u201cThis is not just a failure to serve those to whom it holds an obligation. It is overt cruelty to tens of thousands of New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe settlement stems from complaints filed by the Adams administration last year. According to court documents, the agreement between A&amp;E and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development was signed on Dec. 31, on the final day of the previous administration. A state Housing Court judge signed off on the agreement this week.\nA spokesperson for A&amp;E indicated that the firm inherited violations at its properties and has made it its \u201cmission to collaborate with the City to improve this building and others that were in deep disrepair when we took ownership.\u201d\n\u201cIn every building we\u2019ve purchased, we\u2019ve invested in replacing boilers, rehabbing elevators and fixing tens of thousands of longstanding violations,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased to have settled all legal issues with the city and have agreed upon a repair plan with the housing department that we are already delivering on.\u201d\nThe landlord has between 14 and 90 days to correct outstanding violations, depending on their severity.\nThe announcement of the settlement came around the time that a court\nconfirmed\nSummit Properties as the buyer of more than 5,000 rent-stabilized units from Pinnacle Group on Friday, after the Mamdani administration unsuccessfully tried to stop the sale.\nThe mayor said that the settlement is the largest in the history of HPD\u2019s Anti-Harassment Unit, formed in 2019. The unit, however, has won larger\njudgments\nagainst landlords.\nMeanwhile, elected officials and tenant advocates plan to rally at another A&amp;E property over a cooking gas shutdown at the property. The mayor indicated on Friday that he is \u201caware of issues across the entirety of A&amp;E\u2019s portfolio,\u201d adding that the administration will continue to monitor their conduct.\n",

        "content": "A developer is suing the city of Miami Beach, alleging city officials are illegally blocking a joint venture\u2019s plan to redevelop an Art Deco hotel into a Live Local Act mixed-use project with 249 apartments and 38 hotel rooms.\nIn a complaint filed last month in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, the entity that owns the vacant Bancroft Hotel at 1501 Collins Avenue, and Ocean Steps, an adjacent retail complex, accused the city of Miami Beach of violating the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which allows developers to circumvent local zoning laws to build high-density projects with workforce housing units, set aside for tenants earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThe law also allows developers to bypass public approvals and go through an administrative entitlement process.\nThe developer entity is managed by Todd Rosenberg, who leads Boca Raton-based\nPebb Capital\n.\nThe firm partnered with Coconut Grove-based Maxwelle Real Estate Group, led by Richard Weisfisch, and\nRussell Galbut\n, a principal of Crescent Heights and GFO Investments, two Miami-based firms developing several projects in Miami Beach.\nRosenberg\u2019s entity purchased the Bancroft Hotel and Ocean Steps from a Galbut-affiliated entity for\n$47 million\nin 2021, records show.\nA Miami Beach spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cLike\nmany municipalities\n, the city of Miami Beach doesn\u2019t like to be preempted,\u201d said Thomas Robertson, an attorney representing Rosenberg\u2019s entity. \u201cThey are doing everything they can to stall it, stop it and prevent it.\u201d\nThe city has approved only one out of 12\nLive Local\nproject applications since the law was enacted in 2023, Galbut said. In contrast, the city of Miami, Miami Beach\u2019s neighbor, has approved 61 Live Local projects, Galbut said.\n\u201cEverything in the city of Miami Beach languishes somewhat,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cI think Live Local allows us to deal with the serious issue of affordability. Miami Beach has lost residents because we have no housing and no affordability.\u201d\nRosenberg\u2019s entity is seeking a court order forcing the city to approve its plan and bar Miami Beach officials from imposing development rules aimed at Live Local projects.\nThe joint venture plans to redevelop the locally designated historic site on 1.2 acres into a mixed\u2011use tower with 40 percent of the 249 apartments set aside for workforce housing as required by the\nLive Local Act.\nPreviously, Pebb and its partners contemplated renovating the Bancroft and Ocean Steps into a luxury office project.\nThe city\u2019s planning staff allegedly refused to accept the joint venture\u2019s Live Local application, arguing that the Bancroft and Ocean Steps parcels function as a unified development site, requiring the developer to obtain consent from adjacent condo owners at 1500 Collins Avenue, the lawsuit states. The development entity asserts that it is not required to seek approval from the neighboring condo owners.\nLive Local requires cities to administratively approve qualifying multifamily or mixed\u2011use projects on commercial, industrial or mixed\u2011use land, and it preempts local limits on height, density, floor-to-area ratio and reviews by public zoning boards.\nThe developer-friendly law has riled up some municipalities and a number of residents across South Florida, with some critics\nciting concerns\nover the effects of these larger projects on infrastructure. In Surfside, residents and the town\u2019s mayor are opposing a proposed 11-story, 33-unit residential and hotel project submitted under Live Local. Mayor Charles Burkett called the project a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\u201cI think the Florida politicians that decided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns by this developer-driven initiative is outrageous,\u201d Burkett said earlier this month.\n",

        "content": "A New York-based real estate investment trust dropped nearly $140 million on a shopping complex in San Bernardino County.\nBrixmor Property Group\npurchased\nChino Spectrum Towne Center from MetLife Investment Management for $138 million, the Los Angeles Times reported. CBRE\u2019s Jimmy Slusher, Preston Fetrow, James Tyrrell, Mark Damiani and Shaya Northrup represented the seller of the 461,269-square-foot retail center; the buyer\u2019s representation was not disclosed.\nThe outdoor mall at 3801-4097 Grand Avenue in Chino is currently 95 percent leased and comprises 20 separately owned parcels. Tenants include newly opened grocery anchor\nH Mart\nand other anchors including Walmart Supercenter and Sam\u2019s Club, as well as other big-box stores like Kohl\u2019s, Five Below, Best Buy and Nordstrom Rack. The mix of \u201cspecialty and value-oriented\u201d tenants was \u201cattractive to investors, as evidenced by the competitive bidding\u201d process for the shopping center, Slusher said in a statement, per the Times.\nOther bidders included institutional investors, public and private REITs, private 1031-exchange participants and high-net-worth family offices.\n\u201cThis demand was driven by evolving consumer trends, the prevalence of all-cash investments and the increasing densification of markets such as Chino,\u201d Slusher said.\nChino Spectrum Towne Center brings in more than 14 million visitors per year, according to the Times. The property\u2019s split-lot nature allows flexibility and diversity of ownership if Brixmor opts to sell portions to other investors.\nBrixmor\u2019s purchase of Chino Spectrum Towne Center isn\u2019t its first grocery-anchored retail buy in Southern California. In 2022, the firm\nacquired the 182,000-square-foot Brea Gateway Center\nin Brea for $85.7 million.\nThe Chino Spectrum Towne Center sale is MetLife Investment Management\u2019s latest disposition involving its retail portfolio. Last September, the MetLife investment arm listed The Overlook at Oak Brook, a 54,000-square-foot property in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, a year after\npurchasing it for $41 million\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jim Letchinger\nis inching closer to redeveloping one of Chicago\u2019s most infamous stalled megasites.\nCity planning officials on Thursday unanimously approved Foundry Park, the JDL Development-led proposal to build thousands of apartments and mixed-use buildings on the former Lincoln Yards property along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The vote by the Chicago Plan Commission gives Chicago-based JDL \u2014 Letchinger\u2019s firm \u2014 and Boca Raton-based Kayne Anderson Real Estate their first major city approval for the roughly $3 billion, 6 million-square-foot-plus project, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The\nplan\nwould remake 34 acres between Lincoln Park and Bucktown with more than 3,200 apartments, high-rises topping 450 feet, new retail, offices, hotels and a web of parks and riverwalk.\nFoundry Park still needs approval from the City Council\u2019s zoning committee and the full City Council, and unresolved questions about infrastructure \u2014 and who pays for it \u2014 hover over the project. According to the outlet, that issue helped sink Sterling Bay\u2019s much larger\nLincoln Yards\nvision, which collapsed under the weight of financing challenges tied to roads, bridges and other public works.\nUnder the 2019 redevelopment agreement for Lincoln Yards, Sterling Bay was supposed to front hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure, later reimbursed through tax-increment financing. That structure proved unworkable, and Sterling Bay ultimately lost most of the land to its lender. JDL and Kayne Anderson bought the bulk of the site last fall from Bank OZK after the lender seized it.\nCity planning commissioner Ciere Boatright said during the meeting that the city and the developers are in \u201cearly-ish\u201d talks about incentives to help address infrastructure needs, but emphasized those discussions fall outside the Plan Commission\u2019s scope. Any new redevelopment agreement would go before the city\u2019s Community Development Commission, which is scheduled to meet next month.\nSome elected officials aren\u2019t satisfied. Alderman Brian Hopkins warned that infrastructure promises made during the Lincoln Yards debate \u2014 including redesigned intersections and new river bridges \u2014 can\u2019t simply disappear.\nSupporters argued that Foundry Park\u2019s lower density reduces the burden.\nPlans\ninclude new stretches of Dominick Street and Southport Avenue, roughly 3,000 feet of riverwalk and a future bridge connection to the 606 trail. The first phase alone would cost about $800 million and include roughly 750 homes, retail and a hotel, anchored by a 39-story tower.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "More than three years later than originally envisioned, HS Development Group\u2019s long-anticipated mixed-use project aimed at giving a small Galveston Bay town an urban core is officially underway.\nConstruction kicked off this month on\nSeabrook Town Centre\n, a 19.5-acre development along\nGalveston Bay\nbetween the intersections of Repsdorph Road, Highway 146 and Lakeside Drive in Seabrook that will bring 320 apartments and roughly 28,500 square feet of retail, restaurant and office space to the small\nwaterfront city\n,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The Houston-based development firm is building the $85 million project.\nHS first announced plans for the site in mid-2022, shortly after buying the property from Santa Barbara-based Pacific Ridge. Then the capital markets turned hostile. Rapidly rising interest rates sidelined construction lending and equity, freezing progress on the project for more than two years.\nThat logjam finally broke in the second half of last year, HS COO Steve Helm told the outlet, as banks cautiously returned to the market. Dallas-based NHK Real Estate Investments joined the deal as an equity partner, while Houston-based First Horizon Bank provided construction financing.\nHS spent the delay pre-leasing commercial space and lining up tenants. Signed so far are Pomodoro\u2019s Cucina Italiana, Neighborhood Tap and Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9, with negotiations underway for additional food, fitness and service concepts, according to the publication.\nThe\nretail component\nwill be anchored by two buildings totaling about 20,000 square feet, set on either side of a landscaped courtyard with a stage and water feature. Those buildings are about 55 percent pre-leased. The broader plan also includes a 7,500-square-foot building off Highway 146, a 5,000-square-foot building along Lakeside Drive and four pad sites fronting the highway.\nThe\nresidential piece\n, dubbed The Edge at Seabrook Town Centre, will be a four-story apartment complex with two courtyards, pools, pickleball, gyms and community space. One- to three-bedroom units will range from about 700 square feet to 1,440 square feet, with monthly rents projected between $1,500 and $3,100.\nApartments are expected to go vertical in eight to nine months, with retail following later this year. HS, acting as its own general contractor, expects initial apartments and the first commercial spaces to be completed in less than two years. Full buildout is targeted for the second quarter of 2028.\nMultifamily development is rare in Seabrook and neighboring communities, a barrier that HS believes strengthens the project\u2019s positioning. City approval hinged on pairing apartments with commercial uses, creating what Helm described as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the local market.\nThe project also benefits from the recent completion of Highway 146 improvements, which have spurred new investment along the corridor after years of construction-related disruption.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rick Caruso is out.\nThe billionaire developer of Rosewood Miramar Beach, Palisades Village, The Grove and Americana at Brand\nconfirmed\nlate Friday he will not be running for elected office this year. The Instagram post let the air out of speculation about whether Caruso would make another bid for Los Angeles mayor or try the larger stage of California\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\nCaruso\nsaid he weighed where he can be most impactful and considered what public office might mean for his family in making his decision.\n\u201cAfter much reflection and heartfelt conversations with my family, I have decided not to pursue elected office at this time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a difficult decision, and I am deeply disappointed to step back from an election I believe is so critical to California\u2019s future.\u201d\nCaruso\u2019s name\nemerged\nin political conversations in January after the Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena. The developer was vocal in his critiques of city bureaucracy, while also establishing the nonprofit Steadfast LA aimed at public-private partnerships to expedite rebuilding post-fires.\nOne of the biggest victories of that work for real estate is the pending possibility of a\nMeasure United to House LA carveout\nfor Palisades residential homeowners impacted by the fire. That exemption to the so-called mansion tax was proposed by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass to the City Council in October, a request that stemmed from a meeting with Caruso, who was credited with bringing the idea to the table.\nSteadfast also worked with the city on the rebuilding of the Palisades Recreation Center. Meanwhile,\nCaruso\n\u2019s company intends to reopen the Palisades Village shopping center this year once renovations are completed. The reopening is seen as a boon to helping woo back more residents to the neighborhood.\nBased on Caruso\u2019s announcement Friday, he appears committed to continuing the Steadfast LA work.\n\u201cPublic service does not require a title. It is, and will always be, my calling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI remain devoted to serving our communities in every way I can, just from a different seat.\u201d\nCurrent landscape\nChatter had mounted about another go at a political office, in what would have been a second bid after Caruso lost to Bass in the 2022 mayoral election.\nFriday\u2019s announcement may not be surprising to some, given this year\u2019s political calendar. Indeed, the developer last year said he was weighing his options and would make a decision about a political run at the end of the summer. The primaries for L.A. mayor is set for June 2, with the general election Nov. 3 and a crowded sea of candidates that total 23, including Bass.\nFormer \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nwas the most recent to announce his bid for mayor during a rally earlier this month on the one-year anniversary of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nOutside of Pratt, Democratic Socialist of America member\nRae Chen Huang\nis considered to be another longshot in the mayoral race. Meanwhile, there\u2019s also Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent Austin Beutner in the field, along with a host of lesser-known candidates.",

Business First reported. The five-story, 82,000-square-foot building, which sold alongside its adjacent parking garage, is 84 percent leased.

        "content": "With Indiana openly courting the Chicago Bears and Illinois lawmakers debating a key stadium request, the mayor of Arlington Heights is escalating the rhetoric.\nMayor Jim Tinaglia issued an open letter Friday urging state legislators to immediately pass a \u201ccommon-sense\u201d megaproject bill that would clear the way for a now $5 billion, stadium-anchored redevelopment at the former Arlington International Racecourse, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Without it, Tinaglia warned, Illinois risks watching the Bears bolt for northwest\nIndiana\n.\nThe legislation would allow large developments to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies, giving the Bears predictability through a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, or PILOT, structure. Tinaglia framed the\nrequest\nas reasonable for what would be the largest privately-funded development in state history \u2014 and as a necessary response to Indiana\u2019s increasingly public push to lure the NFL franchise.\nThe letter landed as Illinois officials continue to debate who should shoulder the lingering debt from Soldier Field\u2019s last renovation. Gov. JB Pritzker said Friday that the $534 million still owed on bonds tied to the publicly owned stadium is not the core obstacle to a Bears move, softening a stance he\nemphasized last fall\n.\n\u201cThat is not the core issue,\u201d Pritzker said at a South Side press conference, noting that the borrowing decision was made decades ago. The Bears\u2019 lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, and even an early exit would leave substantial debt outstanding.\nLast year, Pritzker and other lawmakers insisted any new stadium deal must address that obligation. State Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes Soldier Field, has remained firm that Chicago taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be left holding the bag, according to the publication.\nWhile Illinois debates, Indiana is\nmoving\n. A Cincinnati-based law firm, Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister, recently registered to lobby in Indianapolis on behalf of an affiliate of the Bears, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal. The filing coincided with Indiana lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 27, which would establish a Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority empowered to acquire land, finance capital improvements and lease facilities to private entities, including an NFL team.\nAuthored by state Sens. Ryan Mishler and Chris Garten, the amended bill represents Indiana\u2019s first formal legislative overture to the Bears. The team called it \u201ca significant milestone,\u201d praising Gov. Mike Braun and state lawmakers for advancing a framework to keep talks moving.\nThe Indianapolis publication also reported Friday that the city of Gary stepped into the fray, and is offering three different sites as possible locations for a new stadium and mixed-use development, ranging from 145 to 760 acres.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A newly built apartment complex in West Oakland has been seized by its lender after a nearly $60 million loan default.\nAn affiliate of\nParkview Financial\nreal estate investment trust\nbought\nthe 102-unit residential property at 1919 Market Street for $37.5 million, the Mercury News reported, citing a Jan. 7 trustee\u2019s deed. At the time of the formal foreclosure, the unpaid debt on the site was up to $58.5 million.\nAs part of the foreclosure process, an affiliate of the project\u2019s developer, oWow, lost ownership of the multifamily property. Last June, Boston-based lender UC Funds\nacquired\nthe 1919 Market Street building via a deed in lieu of foreclosure, which transferred ownership of the asset to the lender instead of beginning the formal foreclosure process, the San Francisco Business Times reported last summer.\nParkview Financial provided $32 million in construction financing for the project in 2019. The loan was modified the following year. Parkview issued a notice of default last August, followed by another notice last month of the proposed foreclosure sale. The building\u2019s value in July 2024 was $40 million, according to Alameda County Tax Assessor data cited by the Business Times.\nThe apartment complex is an adaptive reuse of a former Greyhound bus terminal, per Parkview Financial. Another former Greyhound station in San Jose similarly faced foreclosure and seizure last year, with a\nlender group moving to foreclose\non the property in October for $22.2 million. Last month, the new owners\nreceived $23 million in financing\nto revive the site, which was already approved for a residential high-rise.\nOver the past year, the Bay Area multifamily market has seen several loan defaults, foreclosures and sales at steep discounts.\nLast month, an affiliate of lender Madison Realty Capital, began the final stages of the foreclosure process for the 363-unit\nFay high-rise\nin San Jose. Veritas Investments is also facing foreclosure on 66 residential buildings in San Francisco after defaulting on $652 million of debt. The more than five dozen properties total 1,566 units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Alexander brothers made their final appearances in federal court before their sex trafficking trial is officially underway.\nJudge Valerie Caproni waded through the arguments and requests by disgraced brokers Oren and Tal, along with brother Alon, in court last week, including arraigning Oren and Alon on a new charge. The brothers will be back in the courtroom on Tuesday, Jan. 20 for jury selection, with the opening statements of their trial scheduled to begin on Jan. 26.\nOn Monday morning, U.S. marshals led the Alexanders, clad in khaki uniforms, into a Downtown Manhattan courtroom for what was supposed to be a public hearing discussing which alleged victims would testify at the upcoming trial and under which names. However, shortly after Caproni took the bench, prosecutors requested that she seal the courtroom to protect the identities of victims. Members of the press, including\nThe Real Deal,\nNew York Times and ABC, were asked to leave.\nBefore kicking reporters and members of the public out, Caproni mentioned for the first time that prosecutors had issued a fifth superseding indictment, which brought the\ntotal number of charges\nagainst one or more of the brothers to 12. Prosecutors allege the brothers participated in a sex trafficking conspiracy between 2008 and 2021.\nThe latest addition charges Oren and Alon with sexual abuse by physical incapacitation related to an alleged attack on a cruise ship bearing a Bahamian flag in 2012. The new count is related to the same incident and victim already described in a count in the indictment accusing the twins of aggravated sexual abuse by force, threat or intoxication.\nThe Alexanders returned to the courtroom on Tuesday for their last pre-trial conference, during which one of Oren\u2019s attorneys, Zach Intrater, pushed back on the added charge, arguing that prosecutors attaching two charges to the same incident \u201cleads us to believe that the government doesn\u2019t know what actually happened.\u201d\nThe defense included their position in a motion to dismiss the count, which also argued prosecutors failed to use the exact language of the criminal statute in the indictment. Caproni denied the motion on Thursday.\nAll three brothers have repeatedly denied the allegations and have pleaded not guilty.\nAt a hearing in November, Alon\u2019s attorney, Howard Srebnick, argued that Alon\u2019s 2019 engagement to his now wife, Shani Zigron Alexander, marked his official withdrawal from the alleged conspiracy, or as Srebnick described it, the end of the \u201csingle life\u201d he\u2019d been living with his brothers.\nSrebnick further claimed that because the conspiracy charge has a five-year statute of limitations, Alon\u2019s withdrawal from it in 2019 would mean that he was charged outside of that window and should therefore be acquitted from the conspiracy count.\nHowever, in a decision filed Monday, Caproni rejected Alon\u2019s bid, arguing instead that Alon\u2019s engagement only signaled to his brothers his decision to get married, not that he would no longer participate in or help his brothers participate in the \u201csex trafficking scheme\u201d alleged by prosecutors.\n\u201cEven if it could be said that Defendant\u2019s proffered statements indicate his intent that \u2018he himself [would] be monogamous,\u2019 it is an extraordinary (and unsupported) leap to infer from his pre-marital statements that \u2018he also intended to stop assisting his brothers [with] their activities with women,\u201d Caproni wrote in the decision.\nThe brothers are also facing several civil lawsuits over drugging and sexual assault allegations, some of which have been dismissed. Kate Whiteman, one of the first two women to accuse Oren and Alon of rape, was\nfound dead\nnear Sydney, Australia late last year, the New York Times reported earlier this week. Whiteman alleged in a lawsuit that the twins raped her during a party in the Hamptons in 2012.\nHer death was reported to the New South Wales coroner\u2019s office in Australia on Oct. 31, 2025.\nA spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, said the brothers learned of Whiteman\u2019s death from media reports and added that \u201cthe decision to release this information publicly on the eve of the trial invites obvious questions.\u201d\nAfter the Times published the story on Whiteman\u2019s death, members of the Alexanders\u2019 defense team reached out to the New South Wales police. A spokesperson for the region\u2019s coroner\u2019s office later confirmed the police had finished investigating Whiteman\u2019s death and found the circumstances surrounding it to be \u201cnon-suspicious.\u201d The cause of death remains unclear.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was a penthouse at 25 Columbus Circle, which was previously owned by billionaire developer Stephen Ross. The apartment, No. PH80, sold for\n$50.7 million\nin an off-market deal between a seller and a buyer whose identities were shielded by LLCs.\nThe full-floor unit traded for $11 million more than its last sale price in 2023, when Ross offloaded it. The 8,200-square-foot home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park.\nElizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers of Sotheby\u2019s International had the listing.",

The latter group tried unsuccessfully to stop, pause and delay the sale, hoping for a tenant-aligned bidder or concessions from Summit.\nThe result came another stop-and-start conflict elsewhere in New York court.\nThree of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players started the week by gearing up for the foreclosure auction for the\ncontrolling entity of Worldwide Plaza\nslated for January 15.\nSL Green and RXR threw a wrench into the process on Tuesday, when the firms sued to block the sale. The companies claimed the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development, amounting to a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown office complex without a fair, competitive process.\nOn Wednesday, a Manhattan judge hit pause on the UCC sale. The decision postpones the auction until Jan. 29 and keeps the current ownership structure in place for now.\nNew York might have been under a winter chill this week, but real estate news came in fast and hot.

        "content": "While the industry continues to hold its breath for what new Mayor Zohran Mamdani will mean for development, it will face a familiar foe on one of City Council\u2019s housing-related subcommittees.\nCity Council Speaker Julie Menin this week appointed Chris Marte to chair the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, Resiliency and Dispositions.\nMarte has the infamous claim to being the only Manhattan City Council member\nto vote against City of Yes\n, which has helped to spur development around the city through rezoning certain neighborhoods, easing air rights transfers and expanding residential conversion opportunities.\nWhile Marte\u2019s role as a City Council member limited his influence on major housing changes like City of Yes, his role on the subcommittee will likely give him a more direct space to exert his worldview, which, put bluntly, has been\nanti-developer\nso far.\n\u201cCity of Yes is a plan by the real estate industry, for the real estate industry,\u201d he once said of the changes that some officials estimate will add\n80,000 new housing units\nto the city in the next 15 years.\nAs committee chair, Marte will be responsible for reviewing landmark designations, as well as uses of city-owned land primed for development, like\n100 Gold Street\n, where the city is partnering with GFP Real Estate to build 3,700 apartments.\nMarte already\nagreed\nto support other planned rezonings, one of which was likely 100 Gold, in exchange for the city keeping the controversial Elizabeth Street Garden intact.\nMarte\u2019s role in reviewing historic district designations will be put to the test early as well.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported YIMBY-aligned\nOpen New York was pushing back on two historic district designations\ngranted by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The group argued those designations, which still have to be reviewed by City Planning and approved by City Council, unfairly exempted those areas from City of Yes.\nFor their part, Open New York executive director Annemarie Gray said in a statement that she is hopeful Marte \u201cwill rise to the moment\u201d and ensure that \u201ccity-owned land can be used for affordable and mixed-income housing, that historic districts build housing like any other district, and that the historic designation process is not abused to block much-needed housing.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Marte did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The world of residential real estate has been shaken up by the merger between the country\u2019s two largest brokerages, Compass and Anywhere Real Estate. New York City has always felt a degree or two removed from the world of national brokerage, but I\u2019m curious what it\u2019s like on the ground for agents in the city working at the affected firms (or the remaining ones)? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A recent\naudit\nby New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli looked at a sample of three Mitchell-Lama developments overseen by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The results were\u2026not great. All three buildings operated at a loss and neglected building repairs while giving out non-mandated bonuses.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The Mamdani-Hochul lovefest has stopped short of the subways, Gothamist\nreported\n. During her \u201cState of the State\u201d speech, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she wants to expand the state-run program that sends nurses and police officers into the subway to force homeless people into hospital care. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has said in the past that he wants to reduce police presence in the subways and wants to end homeless encampment sweeps.\n\u2014 The New York City Housing Authority is inching towards electrification, the New York Times\nreported\n. NYCHA will install induction stoves in 100 units as part of a pilot program. If successful, the agency only has 10,000 units to go. The agency said it expected the first 100 units stoves to be in place by early next year.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deals recorded Friday were\n1010 East Eighth Street\nin Ocean Parkway and\n1289 Lexington Avenue, 19B\nin Carnegie Hill, both for $8 million. The Ocean Parkway single-family home is 2,600 square feet. The Carnegie Hill condo is 3,500 square feet of new construction.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nJill Bernard has the listing for the condo.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$38.1 million\nfor 26 Bleecker Street. The Manhattan Health Center in NoHo is seven stories and 43,365 square feet. Planned Parenthood sold the building to Izaki Group Investments, per\nproperty records\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 15 Renwick Street, Unit TH3. The Hudson Square condo triplex is 3,500 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 104,970-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use development at 54 Sullivan Place in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The bankruptcy auction of Pinnacle\u2019s 5,141-unit, Brooklyn-Manhattan portfolio so perfectly encapsulates the madness of rent stabilization in New York \u2014 and the politics of Mayor Zohran Mamdani \u2014 that I could write a book about it.\nBut in the interest of urgency, below are some quick thoughts on Summit USA\u2019s winning bid of $451.3 million.\nLet\u2019s start with this statement by the mayor\u2019s deputy mayor for housing,\nLeila Bozorg\n: \u201cThanks to our intervention and dedicated organizing by tenants, the new owner of these buildings has committed to invest $30 million and to cure all violations within six months.\u201d\nIs that spin? Of course it\u2019s spin. Here\u2019s why:\nSummit\u2019s Zohar Levy said he\u2019d spend $30 million over five years for repairs and maintenance. That\u2019s $97 per unit, per month.\nOne owner\nof rent-stabilized buildings recently\nsaid\nhe budgets $75 per month for maintenance. Levy pledged just $22 more to fix these supposedly decrepit properties. In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman,\nwhoop-de-damn-doo\n.\nLevy says it will only cost $10 million to clear all the violations within six months and the capex backlog within one year. His maintenance budget for years two through five is $81 per unit, per month. That\u2019s a typical maintenance budget \u2014 and the \u201ccommitment\u201d that Mamdani took credit for is not even legally enforceable.\nOnly 420 units \u2014 8 percent of the portfolio \u2014 account for all of the violations. These may be the units with tenants who like to call 311, or who have been recruited by Mamdani\u2019s head of tenant protection, Cea Weaver.\nThe Mamdani administration had claimed the buildings were in horrendous shape. But 92 percent of the units have no violations.\nGiven that Weaver has spent years recruiting tenants in Pinnacle\u2019s buildings to fight the landlord, it\u2019s surprising that only 1 in 12 units has a violation. Perhaps she told Mamdani the buildings were in worse shape than they actually were.\nLevy says the only thing he needs from the Mamdani administration is help persuading tenants to let repair crews enter their units. If Mamdani agreed to this, I missed it. Perhaps the mayor doesn\u2019t want to say in public that tenants can and do refuse access.\nIf cash flow proves insufficient, Levy says, he will get bridge loans and/or equity infusions to make up the shortfall. Flagstar says it will provide a $3 million line of credit. Not really worthy of a Mamdani victory lap.\nNow, on to the bigger picture. What does the saga say about the rent stabilization system?\nSummit\u2019s $451.3 million bid works out to $87,614 per unit, which Mamdani argued was too much. He admitted that these buildings have little value, contradicting his narrative that their landlords are rolling in dough.\nThe median sale price of Brooklyn apartments last quarter was\n$840,000\n. If units discounted by 90 percent are not cheap enough for tenants, as the mayor said, the solution is probably not a larger discount. It\u2019s creating a functional housing market, where homes are not either extremely expensive or nearly worthless.\nFlagstar, the lender that took a bath on the Pinnacle portfolio\u2019s\n$564 million mortgage\n, is also the lender on Summit\u2019s purchase. Flagstar\u2019s $338.5 million loan covers 75 percent of the purchase price. The lender, formerly New York Community Bank, is ripping off the Band-Aid on its bad loans to rent-stabilized buildings.\nIn politics, after losing a battle like this, the best thing to do is declare victory and move on \u2014 and if you can, turn people\u2019s attention to something else. Which is what Mamdani did.\nOn Friday, he announced a $2.1 million (aka not very big) settlement reached by the Adams administration with the giant landlord A &amp; E. Was the timing a coincidence? There are no coincidences in politics.\n",

        "content": "A pair of Chicago wholesale heirs are holding all the cards in a dispute over a troubled Loop co-working spot.\nThe Nubani brothers, along with their partner, Torrence and Sibley, LLC, filed a lawsuit last week to foreclose on the 43,000-square-foot building at 73 West Monroe Street, alleging that flex-office provider Expansive and its founder, Bill Bennett, defaulted on a loan that has ballooned to over $6.1 million.\nBut the plaintiffs aren\u2019t your typical vulture fund. The entities are controlled by Sameer \u201cSam\u201d and Nader Nubani, scions of the Nubani Distributors Chicago wholesaling empire. Known in the sports memorabilia collectibles world as the \u201cCandy Brothers,\u201d the duo built a reputation not just on their father\u2019s snacks business, but on amassing legendary sports card troves, including rare autographed Michael Jordan items that trade for small fortunes.\nAccording to the complaint filed Jan. 7 in Cook County Circuit Court, the Nubanis acquired the property\u2019s underlying mortgage debt from\nOld National Bank\nin April. The original $7.3 million note, secured by the vintage office building, matured in October 2022 allegedly without repayment. Bennett and Expansive struck a series of forbearance agreements with the lender to withhold regular loan payments, but the last one expired at the end of 2024 and the balance was still almost fully unpaid, according to court filings.\nTorrence and Sibley is registered to an investor named Soufian Abdelkader, who has frequently partnered on Chicago real estate deals with the Nubanis, records show. Neither brother nor an attorney representing Torrence and the brothers returned requests for comment.\nAbdelkader\u2019s entity appears to invest two-thirds of the equity in the trio\u2019s transactions, while the Nubani brothers invest one-third, records show. They\u2019ve made a handful of deals over the past few years for Cook County property, using the same LLCs that are now pursuing the foreclosure in the Loop, public records show. The deals include taking out several mortgages last year for about $5 million apiece, for industrial real estate in towns such as Orland Park and Alsip.\nPerhaps most notably, records show the brothers, along with Torrence and Sibley, acquired the five-story, 29,000-square-foot office and retail property at 200 East Ohio Street for $2.9 million in July 2024, and resold it for $4.8 million in December 2024, records show.\nTheir foreclosure suit hits Bennett where it hurts most: the cradle of his co-working empire. The five-story building at 73 West Monroe is the birthplace of Expansive, whose website shows it still has dozens of locations in the U.S.\nYet this is far from Expansive\u2019s first bout with financial distress. In 2024, it surrendered the four-story, 31,000-square-foot building at\n420 West Huron Street\nin River North to lender Amos Financial via deed in lieu of foreclosure. Expansive has also faced foreclosures in\nHouston\n, Denver and elsewhere.\nBennett bought the Monroe Street building in 2012 to launch what was then Level Office, turning it into the first outpost of a chain that would eventually span the country.\nWeeks before the Loop loan\u2019s October 2022 maturity, the property was\nlisted for sale\nwith brokerage Greenstone Partners. The asking price was $7.6 million \u2014 roughly $142 per square foot \u2014 a figure that would have barely cleared the debt. But the market didn\u2019t bite, drawing no purchasers.\nNow, the \u201cCandy Brothers\u201d are playing for keeps. In a move signaling they are ready to take title, the plaintiffs shelled out nearly $907,000 to pay off delinquent property taxes for 2022 through 2024 to preserve their collateral, their lawsuit says.\nBennett is personally named as a defendant and guarantor, meaning the Nubanis could come after him for the full deficiency. It\u2019s a harsh blow for the CEO, whose firm was once a darling of the co-working craze before the office market soured.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the Nubanis paid to snap up the distressed note. Also unknown is their endgame for the property. Are they planning a pivot to another commercial use, perhaps a showroom for their collectibles? Or planning on trying to revive it as an office building?\nTime will tell as the foreclosure lawsuit plays out in court, with online legal records showing the case will be heard next at 10:30 a.m. July 6 in courtroom 2803 in the Richard J. Daley Center.\n",

        "content": "City Market of Los Angeles in the Fashion District downtown is suing a tenant that owes rent \u2014 to the tune of about $340,000.\nCity Market L.A. is a partially developed mixed-use vision that\u2019s bounded by 9th, San Julian, San Pedro and 11th Street. It\u2019s the brainchild of\u00a0 Peter Fleming, whose family co-founded what was once a produce market on the site.\nCity Market South, which takes up a chunk of the larger development site at the corner of 11th and San Julian Street, is owned and operated by City Market of Los Angeles and is a spot for dining and entertainment. It is the first phase of a 10-acre, mixed-use master-redevelopment plan for the century-old produce mart that now falls under Mark Levy, who signed the lease agreement included in the complaint as chief executive and president of City Market of Los Angeles. Levy was president of City Market South when Fleming made the proposal and led the plan years ago.\nThe agreement in the complaint names Chris Herron as lessee, but the limited liability company named as defendant is connected to film producer Todd Makurath. It could be Makurath rented the space to Herron, but the specifics are unclear. Herron co-founded craft brewery Creature Comforts \u2014 which had a residency at City Market South \u2014 but stepped down before the complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The attorney for the plaintiff and Makurath could not be reached for comment.\nJamison\u2019s debt\nThe latest clock to to start ticking in Jamison\u2019s portfolio is a\nloan\non City Center on 6th, a K-town mall, which went to special servicing after the loan matured and Jamison didn\u2019t pay it off. The debt has a current balance of about $51 million.\nA Jamison spokesperson said the company \u201cengaged CBRE and signed a term sheet with a CMBS provider to refinance the matured loan, which is expected to close in 45 days,\u201d and that \u201ctransferring the loan to the special servicer was a strategic decision in an effort to obtain an extension to work out a refinance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the only case of distress that has the developer playing for time. Dr. David Lee, who founded Jamison, the company his daughter Jamie Lee now runs, is the named sponsor on four loans connected to real estate in Koreatown and downtown that landed in special servicing: 811 Wilshire, Equitable Plaza, Central Plaza and City Center on 6th. The collective current balance of the special-serviced debt is about $230 million, according to Morningstar data.\nJamison entered forbearance agreements on the loans connected to Equitable Plaza and Central Plaza but faces foreclosure on 811 Wilshire after a deal to sell fell apart, per servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nToo early to call\nJamison isn\u2019t the only investor, by any means, to see its debt go to special servicing. According to Morningstar, the commercial mortgage-backed securities loan on a mall in Lakewood, once owned by Macerich, moved to special servicing. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 analysts suggest the transfer was more proactive than anything because the loan doesn\u2019t mature until the summer, the mall traded hands pretty recently, and its new owners want to redevelop it.\nWhen Macerich sold the Lakewood Center for $332 million, the price included the assumption by the joint-venture buyer of a $317 million loan on the real estate, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated mid-August. That loan, it said, comes due June this year. Representatives for new owners Pacific Retail Capital Partners, Lyon Living and Silverpeak did not respond to a request for comment.\nDeal downtown\nDowntown did not appear once in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nranking\nof the priciest multifamily deals in Los Angeles County last year \u2014 but it looks as though things are already different as 2026 rolls out, thanks to a pricey per-unit apartment tower\ntrade\nin South Park.\nMetLife sold 717 West Olympic Boulevard to APW Avenue Group for about $69 million, which comes out to roughly $453,000 per apartment. On a per-unit basis, it\u2019s more than the priciest multifamily deal all last year: Waterton\u2019s purchase of a Woodland Hills apartment complex for about $180 million, or $345,000 per apartment. On another straight-up comparison of price per unit, the MetLife trade still trails Carmel Partners\u2019 $141 million Marina del Rey buy, which came out to about $578,000 per apartment, and was the priciest per unit deal all 2025.\n",

The Iranian government responded with an internet blackout that provided cover to security forces killing protesters; days later, the death toll is in the thousands.\n\u201cThe streets are literally awash in the blood of young people,\u201d said Iranian-born developer Shahab Karmely, who operates in New York and South Florida.\nKarmely\u2019s father, who was in the rug business and owned real estate in Iran, was put on a death list but managed to escape with the family in 1978. Karmely, after being deported from the U.S., was taken in as a refugee in the U.K.\nMoayedi and Karmely are two of the millions of Iranians whose families fled the country around the time of the revolution and haven\u2019t been able to return. They settled in California,\nNew York\nand Texas, and some, like Moayedi and Karmely, became successful in real estate. They may not agree on a path to peace, but they\u2019re united in seeing this moment as an opening for democratic change in Iran.\nWhile Austin-based developer Ari Rastegar has never visited his father\u2019s homeland, \u201cMy entire life has been these conversations and the trauma that ensued from it,\u201d he said. Born in Austin in 1982, Rastegar, who founded Rastegar Property Company, grew up listening to stories from his grandfather, who was the shah\u2019s doctor.\nLike Moayedi, he would like to see Iran\u2019s leader be someone chosen by the people of Iran.\nMoayedi and Rastegar, men from different generations who were born in different countries, agree the conflict shouldn\u2019t be used to fuel Islamophobia.\n\u201cIslam doesn\u2019t teach that kind of stuff,\u201d Moayedi said. \u201cThese are just goons and gangsters killing people left and right.\u201d\nIslam is a \u201cvery peaceful, beautiful religion,\u201d echoed Rastegar. \u201cThis is a dictator fuckhead thing. This is not a Muslim thing.\u201d\nAllie Beth\u2019s bid for local control\nDallas\u2019 reigning luxury brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates is making a bid to\npreserve local control\nas Compass consolidates power throughout Texas. CEO Keith Conlon recently\nacquired an ownership stake\nin the firm in an equity investment deal with its parent company, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based HomeServices of America.\nThe deal aims to keep the company\u2019s center of authority local as Compass gathers more teams under its banner after its\nmerger with Anywhere Real Estate\nwas finalized earlier this month. Dallas is the rare Texas market that\u2019s dominated by homegrown brands. It\u2019s the only city of the state\u2019s three top luxury markets in which the biggest sale of the year was represented by agents outside of Compass or the brands under its umbrella. Two Allie Beth Allman agents negotiated the sale of 6601 Hunters Glen Road in Dallas for $30.5 million, the state\u2019s most expensive residential sale of 2025.\nUBS deepens Y\u2019all Street bench\nY\u2019all Street logged another high-profile win when UBS announced it\u2019s establishing an\noffice hub in Uptown\n. The wealth management firm will take 26,000 square feet at 23Springs, the 26-story office building at 2323 Cedar Springs Road, whose tenant roster already includes Bank OZK, Deloitte and law firm Sidley Austin. A state filing estimates UBS will spend $5.6 million on the buildout, with construction slated to start this week and wrap up by June.\nLurin Capital\u2019s legal issues spread to Alabama\nThe city of Huntsville, Alabama is the latest municipality to sue\nJon Venetos\u2019 troubled Dallas-based firm\nover conditions at one of its properties. In a Madison County Circuit Court lawsuit filed Jan. 2, the city claims\nLurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone\n, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road. The lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the property Huntsville claims has been vacant for two years, with no utility service, missing windows and doors, a boarded-up exterior, overgrown weeds, siding hanging off of the buildings, a dilapidated metal playset and a pool full of dirty water.\n",

        "content": "November seems far off, but some agents are looking to the fourth quarter and what the election for\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner\ncould yield.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 David Yadegaran is one.\nThe Real Deal\ncaught up with him on Friday as his co-listing in Brentwood on actor\nPatricia Richardson\u2019s home\nwas set to close. He said he\u2019s hopeful about the year. Big sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games are part of the optimism. The other is the November election when a new insurance commissioner will be voted in.\n\u201c\nInsurance\nhas been one of the biggest challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tightening factor for L.A. over the last few years on top of [\nMeasure] ULA\n.\u201d\nWith current Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara termed out, four fresh faces \u2013 three Democrats and one Republican \u2013 are looking to tackle one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches.\nLandscape of hopefuls\nSo far, that candidate crop includes:\nBen Allen (D), an attorney and state senator from Santa Monica. Allen is looking to make the Department of Insurance more transparent, wean more people off the state\u2019s FAIR Plan and regulate how carriers respond following a fire or other disaster.\nSteven Bradford (D), a former state senator and 2009 mayor of Gardena. He\u2019s pushing for transparent pricing, discounts for properties that address earthquake or fire prevention and a public-private insurance partnership in high-risk communities.\nPatrick Wolff (D), originally from New York, Wolff founded an auto and home insurance business and holds a property and casualty license from the state. Wolff aims to up the accountability of insurance companies with mandates such as discounts for homeowners with reduced fire risks around their properties and the disclosure of underinsurance.\nStacy Korsgaden (R), A San Luis Obispo County licensed insurance professional since 1988 who said in a\nCalMatters guest column\nthe state\u2019s problems are the result of \u201cdecades of accumulating regulations, rigid price controls, insufficient wildfire prevention and mitigation\u201d among other \u201cunmanaged factors.\u201d\nColdwell Banker\u2019s latest play\nAs market consolidation goes, Coldwell Banker Real Estate\u2019s gotten 2026 off to a fine start.\nThe brokerage\u2019s latest franchising deal is with\nCal American Homes\nowners Jessie Rodriguez and Aaron Juarez, who have since renamed their business Coldwell Banker Icon.\nRodriguez started Cal American in Rancho Cucamonga around the time of the Great Financial Crisis, after obtaining his license at the age of 19 while in college. After working for other people, he struck off on his own.\n\u201cThen the market turned and it crashed,\u201d Rodriguez recalled.\nHe said he viewed that period of time, in which the Inland Empire was commonly cast as the poster child for the foreclosure crisis, as an opportunity to start at the bottom and grow a business from there.\n\u201cIt kind of felt like the wild, wild west,\u201d he said of the subprime mortgage meltdown that devastated commercial and residential real estate. \u201cEverything was so devastated and prices were down\u2026. It was a great time to learn.\u201d\nThen the market rebounded.\nRodriguez and Juarez brought about 25 agents and a Claremont office to Coldwell Banker, with plans to open a South Orange County outpost this month, followed by the acquisition of an existing brokerage business that will expand the company\u2019s footprint back to Rancho Cucamonga and tack on another 60 agents. Details to come on both those moves.\nWhat\u2019s next for Alon Abady?\nAlon Abady is a name those dealing in L.A.\u2019s high end know well.\nAlthough, the real estate investor\u2019s most recent play this past week was a donation in the form of gifting\n9911 West Pico Boulevard\nto West Coast Chabad. Abady bought the 16-story office with a 1,200-vehicle parking garage from Blackstone in 2023 for $35 million, or $140 per square foot. The property will now be turned into a synagogue and facilities for education, mental and social services and events.\nWhile the Waterfall Bridge Capital managing partner\u2019s biggest deal was the $96 million buy of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, he\u2019s been a big spender when it comes to luxury homes.\nThat includes the 2020 purchase of Simon Cowell\u2019s home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills for $25 million. Abady made a tidy profit on that when he sold the home three years later for $34 million. He also sold a $16.6 million residence in La Quinta\u2019s exclusive Madison Club community to Hailey and Justin Bieber in 2023 and, in 2024, paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way from conservationists Dan and Susan Gottllieb.\nResi watchers should be on the lookout for Abady\u2019s next play.\nHe told\nTRD\nafter a \u201clull\u201d the past couple years in residential, he\u2019s got a pipeline of listings, including an $85 million estate he\u2019ll list through the Beverly Hills Estates. Most of the other homes headed to market, he said, will likely be priced in the $30 million to $50 million range.\n",

        "content": "A skyscraper, an eye-sore of an abandoned tower foundation, and a waterfront lot of what-could-have-been for Oakland\u2019s professional baseball team shook alive this week, each signaling in their own way momentum for a region still figuring out its post-pandemic identity.\nLet\u2019s start with the tallest news.\nDespite surging demand and the city\u2019s strongest office leasing year since 2019, San Francisco has not seen many of its actual office buildings trade hands, even as the value of middle-of-the-pack buildings has fallen off a cliff. One private equity executive told me earlier this week that despite the leasing activity brought on by the artificial intelligence industry and return-to-office policies, no one appears ready to put a major bet on office towers. The opportunity, according to the executive, lies in securing a stake in one of the city\u2019s premiere towers, or nabbing a mediocre building off the floor and renovating it into a competitor.\nDivcoWest, the San Francisco-based developer and asset manager, appears to have chosen Door 1. According to a source close to the deal,\nDivcoWest has agreed to purchase a significant stake in 101 California,\none of the more recognizable pieces of San Francisco\u2019s skyline. The seller, according to Green Street News, is the Hong Kong Monetary Fund, which has owned part of the tower since 2012, when it teamed up with the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, GIC Private Limited, to buy a 92 percent stake in the building.\nWrapped in glass and steel, the 600-foot-tall cylinder in the heart of the Financial District contains more than 1.2 million square feet of office space, and hosts tenants such as Chime, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Hines, the Texas developer who led on the building\u2019s construction in 1982 and retains a stake, recently put $75 million into a ground-floor renovation that upgraded the outdoor plaza and added a cafe and lounge. That project, drawn up before the pandemic, was completed in 2023.\nThe deal has not yet closed, but if it does, it will mark the largest tower trade in years. Still,\nthe roughly $900 per square\nfoot (just over $1.1 billion) asking price remains well below the nearly $1.5 billion valuation the structure received in 2015.\nThe 101 California tower is San Francisco\u2019s 10th-tallest structure. It would have been tied for 11th or if the Oceanwide Center development had ever materialized into its proposed 910- and 600-foot tall mixed-used skyscrapers. Instead the Financial District site has sat as an eyesore for years, as the developer, Oceanwide Holdings, abandoned the project after breaking ground on the property\u2019s foundation.\nYet, the property may soon enjoy new life. On Thursday, the project\u2019s lender \u2014 Chinese financial services firm Haitong \u2014\nseized control of the 1.3-acre site\nin an auction for $100 million. Now, the firm is expected to turn around and sell the property for the same price to the\nSan Francisco Recovery Fund\n, a joint venture of SKS Partners\u2019 Dan Kingsley and private equity pro Jay Yang. The fund already put down a non-refundable deposit on the building toward the end of 2025.\nKingsley and Yang have not disclosed their plans for the property, and declined to say whether they still expect new towers on the site.\nWhile plans for the Oceanwide site remain concealed, Oaklanders finally have a sense of what will happen to Howard Terminal. The waterfront property represents a still-open wound for the city, as it was the proposed location for the new Oakland Athletics ballpark before the sports franchise relocated to Las Vegas after political disputes over the stadium\u2019s plans.\nAccording to reports, sports remain in the property\u2019s future. The Port of Oakland, which oversees land use at Howard Terminal,\nhas approved a proposal for a new soccer stadium on the site to host the city\u2019s Roots and Soul franchises.\nAlthough the plans were accepted, the sides are still hammering out a formal contract agreement. Los Angeles-based developer, Industrial Realty Group, is also expected to play a role in the site\u2019s redevelopment. According to the San Francisco Business Times, the firm wants to maintain the property as a working dock, and will support traditional, commodity-based maritime operations.\n",

He plans to build a bayfront supertall office tower in the Brickell Financial District, which will house the headquarters for both firms.

        "content": "Jim Letchinger\u2019s\nJDL Development\nis shifting its plan for the most expensive condos at the top of its One Chicago skyscraper: The firm is working to build out full-floor residences after initially advertising them as raw space.\nOn Tuesday, the 69th-floor penthouse at the River North tower went under contract with an undisclosed buyer at a nearly $8 million asking price, according to listing information. The next day, the developer put the 70th floor up for sale at nearly $8.3 million.\nThe units are unfinished but will be built out by JDL,\nLetchinger\u2019s\ndevelopment firm that constructed the two-tower complex at 14 West Superior Street. Letchinger told\nThe Real Deal\nthe firm first planned to sell the floors as raw space, assuming ultra-wealthy buyers would want to bring in their own contractors for custom designs. But as the units sat on the market, it became clear that downtown buyers were looking for move-in ready homes.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to deal with the contractor, they don\u2019t want to deal with building it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all dry-walled now, and delivery is much shorter. That\u2019s the other thing, people don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d\nThe pending sale of the 69th-floor unit after more than a year on the market suggests that strategy is working. At its $8 million asking price, it would be the most expensive sale at the Gold Coast tower since early 2025, when the 72nd-floor residence sold for $8.9 million, according to property records.\nThe 76-story building was completed in 2022 and features 77 residences starting on the 44th floor, sitting atop a 735-unit apartment portion and a retail base that includes a Whole Foods and Life Time fitness center. Its construction debt was refinanced with a new loan of $415 million in 2024, with developer equity getting kicked in to cover the positions of its other investors, including\nWanxiang America Real Estate\n.\nThe lower tier of finished condos at the building has seen more success than the highest units. Around 60 units have been sold since sales began in 2022, according to property records, with an average sale price of about $3 million. Most sales ranged between $1 million and $4 million. After the 72nd-floor unit, the two highest sales brought in $6.1 million and $5.6 million in 2022.\nJDL sold that 72nd-floor unit as raw space but ended up building it out for the buyer, Letchinger said. The level of interest from prospective buyers who toured it inspired JDL to finish the rest of the units.\n\u201cNow that we have something to really walk through and show, we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cI would be shocked if we don\u2019t sell them all in the next six months.\u201d\nThe 69th- and 70th-floor buildouts are expected to be completed this summer, the listing information says.\nWhile only the 70th-floor residence is currently listed in the MLS, the 71st-floor unit is also available and being finished, Letchinger said, as well as the two-story penthouse on the 74th and 75th floors. Buyers will have multiple finish packages to choose from that will impact the total cost of the units.\nThe 67th-floor unit is still being sold as raw space because its large terrace might attract a buyer with a different vision or budget, Letchinger said. Meanwhile,\nthe 68th floor\n, which is also being finished by JDL, is being leased to tenants who already live in the building, he said.\nThe finished 73rd-floor residence went under contract with a buyer in early 2023 with a nearly\n$14 million listing price\n, but the listing was removed more than a year later and no sale was recorded in county records.\nNancy Tassone of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represents the developer on the listings. She didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "The former CEO of title insurer First American Financial, whose 26-year career at the firm came to an abrupt end following assault allegations, scored the priciest single-family home sale in Long Beach last year, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data and research by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nKenneth DeGiorgio and wife Nichol DeGiorgio offloaded 5490 East The Toledo in Naples for $10.5 million in June, a couple of months after he was\nterminated\nfrom the Santa Ana-based title insurer, which is publicly traded with a market capitalization of around $6 billion.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods.\nThe DeGiorgios sold the three-story, 5,714-square foot home for about $1,838 per square foot. That is less on a per-square-foot basis than the second-priciest sale in Long Beach in 2025, which went for $8 million, or $1,983 per square foot. To see the top 10 single-family sales in Long Beach last year, click\nhere\n.\nKenneth DeGiorgio was arrested in April 2025 following an assault charge stemming from an altercation on a cruise ship. The disgraced executive, whose\nLinkedIn profile\nsays he\u2019s self-employed in Miami, was on a Virgin Voyages Caribbean cruise ship with his wife when he allegedly choked another passenger on board. The case was\nterminated by June 9\n.\nThe couple put the property on the market on May 7 for $10.7 million, according to the Press-Telegram.\nThe DeGiorgios acquired the 1984-built home, which was remodeled in 2004, in 2017 for $6.9 million, property records indicate. The waterfront house has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, panoramic views from all levels, climate controlled wine room with a 1,000-bottle capacity, two laundry rooms and a ground spa pool. The primary suite has a private view deck with an outdoor fireplace. The house\u00a0 has a 360-degree panoramic rooftop view deck spanning the entire rooftop and comes with a three-car garage.\nVista Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Keith Muirhead listed the property, and Desert Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Tamara Baron represented the buyer.\n",

        "content": "Office markets in\nHouston\nand\nDallas\nhave made strides recovering from the pandemic, but Austin tells a different story.\nAustin boomed during the pandemic, as developers built enormous built-to-suit trophy towers for tech companies fleeing California. But, the bubble burst almost immediately, with interest rates cooling the market abruptly.\nOffice space absorption in Austin matches that narrative. Absorption was positive in Austin for 2021 and 2022 and abruptly turned negative in 2023, when the city reported a 1.5 million-square-foot occupancy loss. Absorption turned positive again in 2024, but was again negative in 2025, losing 3,600 square feet, according to a fourth-quarter office market report from JLL.\nAbsorption trends in Dallas and Houston show markets steadily recovering from the blow dealt by the pandemic. In 2021, annual absorption was negative 1.5 million square feet in Dallas and over negative 4 million square feet in Houston. Recovery hasn\u2019t necessarily been linear, and the cities are stabilizing at different rates, with Dallas reporting 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption in 2025 \u2014 its first positive annual rate since 2019 \u2014 and Houston posting a negative absorption rate of 311,000 square feet last year, JLL\u2019s report shows.\nThe markets of the Texas Triangles are on very different trajectories, but they\u2019re all sporting\u00a0 elevated vacancy rates since the pandemic. Vacancies notched up slightly in Austin in 2025, ending the year at 26 percent, compared to 25.2 percent at the end of 2024. Houston\u2019s vacancy rate similarly finished 2025 at 26.3 percent, after peaking at 27 percent in 2024. Vacancies are highest in Dallas, hitting 27.2 percent at year-end 2025, a slight uptick from the year before when the vacancy rate was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nAI in Austin\nThe abrupt contraction of big tech\u2019s Austin office space started leveling out in 2025.\nFor example, after leaving the 35-story, 804,000-square-foot Sail Tower mostly empty for two years, despite holding a full-building lease, Google is finally\nmoving into the downtown office building\nat 601 West Second Street.\nWhile Austin logged negative absorption for the year, net absorption was positive for the fourth quarter, at 23,700 square feet. Tech companies accounted for the three largest leases of the quarter. VMware renewed its lease for nearly 135,000 square feet at River Place; an unnamed e-commerce company subleased 108,000 square feet at Domain Gateway; and Nvidia renewed its 79,000-square-foot lease at The Crossing at Lakeline.\nTech companies make up nearly a third of tenants for pre-leased projects in the pipeline, according to JLL.\nAustin has been burned by tech in the last five years, but it stands to benefit from the rise of AI in 2026, JLL said in its report.\nTrophy development\nAustin has the largest development pipeline of the three cities.\nNearly 1.7 million square feet of office space is planned or under construction in Austin, edging out Dallas\u2019 1.56 million-square-foot pipeline, and far surpassing the 760,000 square feet of office space in development in Houston, according to JLL.\nPlus, Austin landlords stand to make the most money from that upcoming space.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, asking rent for Class A properties was $60.89 per square foot in Austin, far surpassing Dallas\u2019 rate of $42.35 per square foot, and Houston\u2019s rate of $37.36, JLL\u2019s report shows.\n",

At stake are 173 retail stores that may be shuttered, according to analysis by TRD Data.\nSaks Global, which on its website claims to own or control some 13 million square feet of leasable area, also owns Neiman Marcus, which it acquired for\n$2.7 billion in 2024\n, and outlet offshoots like Last Call. Saks Off 5th, one of these discount retailers, occupies about half of Saks Global\u2019s stores, 77 out of 173.

        "content": "Former real estate teammates\nMitch Goltz\nand\nShai Wolkowicki\nhave been hit with another lawsuit while they work through their own internal court fights to wind down their old company GW Properties.\nAndrew Goodman and Ari Golson\u2019s Chicago-based firm Wolcott Partners filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court this month alleging GW Properties failed to pay off a $1 million loan. The note is backed by a Wolcott-funded mortgage taken out on a vacant retail property in west suburban La Grange, owned by the former GW duo.\nGoltz and Wolkowicki have also racked up over $700,000 in mechanic\u2019s liens against the property at 14 South La Grange Road for allegedly failing to pay various contractors as promised for their work.\nWolcott issued the debt to GW in July 2024, and when it matured a year later, the investors failed to pay it off. Now, Wolcott is asking a judge to approve a foreclosure of the property because the mortgage is in default.\nIt\u2019s far from the only debt that GW ventures took on from Wolcott. GW borrowed a $12 million mezzanine loan from Wolcott in early 2024, using seven GW-owned properties in Chicago and its suburbs as collateral, including the La Grange property, public records show.\nMost of the properties have since been sold over the last year and released from the Wolcott deal, including the\nChurch Street Plaza in Evanston that fetched over $31 million\nfrom buyer Continuum Capital, records show.\nReached by phone, Goltz said he and Wolkowicki are in the process of refinancing the La Grange property.\nWolcott\u2019s lawsuit comes as the GW pair is in the process of winding down their old firm and going separate ways. Wolkowicki is staying in the multifamily business while Goltz continues to focus on retail and mixed-use developments with his new firm, GTZ Properties.\nYet recent legal battles have ensnared the business partners as they make career transitions.\nInvestors and lenders\nare currently pursuing\nWolkowicki and Chickoo Patel\n, his business partner in the multifamily sector, for nearly $20 million total in various court cases, including $63,000 in credit card debt Patel allegedly owes to American Express.\nAs those lawsuits piled up, Wolkowicki hit back, alleging Patel was\nrunning a \u201cponzi-like scheme\u201d\nthat has bilked his ex-partners out of more than $10.8 million through fraud, theft and mismanagement.\nOver the years, Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, have invested in more than 50 real estate projects with Patel. In addition to that trio\u2019s Chicago holdings, they also jointly owned rental properties throughout Illinois, including in Rockford, and Springfield, where Patel and Wolkowicki are facing a $16 million foreclosure lawsuit from Old National Bank for an apartment complex at 1833 Seven Pines Road.\nWhile those disputes don\u2019t involve Goltz, he\u2019s facing his own legal drama with Wolkowicki in addition to Wolcott\u2019s $1 million suit.\nWolkowicki is suing Goltz,\nalleging Goltz siphoned funds and pledged company assets\nto outside groups without consent, specifically diverting over $2 million from the sale of Church Street Plaza in Evanston. The lawsuit is pending in Cook County Circuit Court, as Goltz is trying to dismiss the complaint and force his former partner to work it out in arbitration or mediation, while Wolkowicki wants to keep the case in court.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all bad news for the pair. The duo last week sold a 128,000-square-foot industrial property at 3800 North Milwaukee Avenue for $16.4 million, moving on from the site a block away from the Portage Park People\u2019s Gas site\nGW walked away from redeveloping\nafter hitting\nmultiple snags with a $110 million proposal\n.\nThe building at 3800 North Milwaukee was also used as collateral for GW\u2019s mezzanine loan from Wolcott, public records show. Before the sale, the Milwaukee Avenue property also had another large mechanic\u2019s lien recorded against the GW ownership last month. It alleged DCS Midwest \u2014 the same contractor that\u2019s allegedly gone unpaid in La Grange \u2014\u00a0is owed $3.4 million for work it performed without yet being compensated. It\u2019s unclear if GW\u2019s subsequent sale of the property will clear up the dispute.\nMeanwhile, GTZ Properties secured necessary entitlements to rezone an Aurora property for mixed-use development. Goltz said the Aurora project is one of many properties that GTZ is making progress on redeveloping.\nLast year, his new firm also bought a four-building, 327,000-square-foot\nOak Brook office complex\nout of distress for $9 million. GTZ hasn\u2019t yet finalized plans for that property.\nSam Lounsberry contributed reporting.\n",

She started shopping the five-bedroom abode two years later, though it underwent\nmultiple price chops\nbefore landing a pending deal.\nThe full-floor home has seven bathrooms and four fireplaces. It also features a Juliet balcony and library with views of Central Park.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Mary Fitzgibbons and Martha Kramer had the listing.\nThe building has been home to a number of pricey deals, including last year, when Sarah Solomon, the widow of pharmaceutical executive Martin Solomon, sold her apartment for\n$37 million\n. Similar to Roepers\u2019 co-op, Unit No. 7, which initially asked $55 million, had multiple price chops after hitting the market in 2022.\nThe co-op was the priciest of 21 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals between Jan. 12 and Jan. 18, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, when 20 luxury properties in the borough found buyers.\nCo-ops nabbed the No. 1 and No. 2 spots topping Manhattan\u2019s luxury market last week, which has only happened three times since June 2021, including in May. The two pricey signed contracts come as deals for\nco-ops have been outpacing\ncondo sales in the borough, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s fourth quarter report.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a co-op at\nthe Dakota\n, with an asking price of $24 million. Apartment No. 33, which hasn\u2019t traded in more than 40 years, overlooks Central Park and has three bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a staff room, corner living room, library and four wood-burning fireplaces.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nBuilt in 1884, the landmarked building at 1 West 72nd Street is among the most well-known buildings in New York City. It has a long list of storied residents, including Judy Garland, Paul Simon and Yoko Ono, who continued living at the Dakota after her husband, John Lennon, was shot and killed outside the building\u00a0 in 1980.\nOf the 21 properties to find buyers, nine were condos, seven were co-ops, one was a condop and five were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $201 million, which works out to an average of $9.1 million and a median of $6.1 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 6 percent.\n",

        "content": "Developer Charles Cohen wants a New York court to give him additional time to resolve a $187 million personal debt owed to Fortress Investment Group, arguing that he has made progress toward repayment and is actively pursuing further asset sales.\nCohen said he has worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d over the past 18 months to reduce the obligation, including selling two New York\nbuildings\nto Vornado Realty Trust and using $52 million of the proceeds to pay Fortress, according to a Jan. 13 affidavit\nreported by Crain\u2019s New York\n. He contends that despite what he characterizes as excessive litigation from Fortress\u2019 attorneys, his team has delivered \u201cexceptional\u201d results under difficult conditions.\n\u201cWhat I need is more time to continue doing the right thing,\u201d he said in the affidavit.\nFortress, however, says its patience has run out. The private equity firm, which manages roughly $50 billion in assets, is asking the court to appoint a receiver to sell portions of Cohen\u2019s 12 million\u2011square\u2011foot portfolio to satisfy the debt. Fortress has also accused Cohen of improperly transferring his Connecticut estate and 220\u2011foot yacht to his wife to shield them from creditors \u2014 allegations Cohen denies.\nIn its Jan. 14 response, Fortress argued that Cohen \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to oversee the sales process.\nCohen, who has spent nearly five decades at the family\u2011run Cohen Brothers, controls major Midtown properties including 805 Third Avenue, 3 Park Avenue and\n750 Lexington Avenue\n. He recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue and 3 East 54th Street to Vornado at distressed pricing and says Vornado chairman Steven Roth is exploring additional acquisitions or joint ventures.\nCohen claimed in the affidavit that he was in talks to sell a White Plains\noffice building\nand plans to market 622 Third Avenue, a 1 million\u2011square\u2011foot tower near Grand Central.\nOne asset Cohen insists must remain untouched is the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, a 1.6 million\u2011square\u2011foot complex he calls essential to the stability of his entire portfolio. Selling it, he argues, would \u201cjeopardize\u201d operations and lead to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of his business.\nAppointing a receiver would trigger loan defaults across his holdings, Cohen claimed, forcing banks to demand repayment ahead of Fortress and potentially leaving the firm \u201cwiped out.\u201d\nFortress disputes this, saying receivership would not trigger default at the Pacific Design Center and that the property\u2019s high value could allow Fortress to be repaid more efficiently than through New York asset sales.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A landmark in Santa Rosa is at the center of a housing debate as a Bay Area developer seeks to build residences on the site.\nSan Jose-based Swenson is once again\npursuing\nplans for a new swath of townhouses on a nearly 14-acre property that includes the remains of the historic Carrillo Adobe, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Swenson purchased the property approximately two decades ago and at the time looked to build new housing, but left land around the adobe to be deeded to the city so people could see it from the street.\nThe newly proposed project, dubbed Creekside Village Townhomes, would consist of 162 three-story\ntownhouses\n. Swenson\u2019s preliminary plan calls for preserving the adobe on a 4-acre park and constructing buildings around it. The company presented its designs to the city at a public meeting last month and has yet to submit a formal proposal. Doing so would begin the evaluation process, which includes studies of the land\u2019s historical resources and other environmental and traffic considerations.\nCutting down the size of the park area \u201cslightly\u201d compared to the blueprint nearly 20 years ago would help Swenson financially, Mark Pilarczyk, president of development at Swanson, said at the meeting, per the Chronicle.\nThe idea is already facing pushback, including from those with historical ties to the Carrillo Adobe. Larry Carrillo, a descendant of Maria Carrillo, the matriarch who first lived in the adobe in the 1840s, said Swenson \u201creally poked the bear.\u201d\nNative American community leaders and historians are also speaking out against the project.\n\u201cBuilding houses on top of this land would be a continued erasure of our history and presence here,\u201d Greg Sarris, chairman of the Graton Rancheria federation of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, told the Chronicle, saying the city should protect all 14 acres surrounding the Adobe. The property has \u201clayers of history\u201d that \u201dmakes it a compelling place, and you wouldn\u2019t want to disrupt it or obliterate it or hide it for all time,\u201d Eric Stanley, associate director and curator of history at the Museum of Sonoma County, added.\nRoughly 20 years ago, the Diocese of Santa Rosa sold the property and the adobe to Swenson for $5.1 million. When Swenson first floated building on the site, it called for 140 market-rate\ncondominiums\nand 25\nlow-income units\nand it was required to create a park for the adobe and grant it to the city. The 2008 financial crisis halted the plans, and 82-year-old Larry Carrillo has been personally removing weeds from the\nSonoma County\nsite ever since as there\u2019s currently no government funding or entity to preserve it.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Jamison\u2019s plan to turn the building into apartments\nfirst surfaced in 2023\n.\nJamison\u2019s goal is to turn the 33-story, approximately 620,000-square-foot office tower into 686 units, making it one of the larger conversion projects in the city. Construction on the project started earlier this month.\nThe developer has undertaken a number of conversion projects in Koreatown, with three under construction now and 10 in the works, including 1055 West Seventh Street.

Last week, Jamison\u2019s $55 million loan tied to the City Center on 6th mall in Koreatown moved to special servicing,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. The loan on the property at 3500 West Sixth Street originated in November 2019 and currently has a balance of $51 million.\nFour other Jamison properties, including\n811 Wilshire Boulevard\ndowntown and\nEquitable Plaza\nin Koreatown, are also in special servicing.

        "content": "Cary is putting real money behind JM Developers\u2019 long-awaited redevelopment of the former Maplewood School site, approving up to $12.4 million in tax increment financing to help clear the way for a dense residential project.\nThe Cary village board unanimously signed off on a development agreement last week with Chicago-based JM to remake the long-shuttered school property at 422 Krenz Avenue into a mix of apartments, townhomes and single-family houses, according to village documents and public meeting records. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the deal clears a key hurdle for a project estimated to cost more than $94 million and construct more than 200 rental units alongside for-sale homes.\nUnder the agreement, the developers \u2014 an umbrella group of companies consisting of\nCordogan Clark\n, JTE Real Estate Services, Eriksson Engineering Associates,\nand\nD2\nCapital Advisors \u2014 would tap the Central Cary TIF District, established in 2023, to help cover eligible costs including demolition of the old school building and storm sewer upgrades along School Street. Community Development Director Brian Simmons described the pact as effectively a binding contract, with demolition expected to begin this summer.\nThe village agreed to sell the property to the developers for $1. In return, JM Developers must secure zoning approvals within 180 days. The publication reported that representatives for the firm said the TIF assistance is needed to complete the project in a \u201ctimely manner.\u201d\nVillage officials are betting the\nsubsidy\nwill pay off. Over the estimated 23-year life of the TIF, the project is projected to generate more than $36.5 million in incremental property taxes, more than tripling the public investment, according to municipal estimates.\nThe plan has been in the works for about a year and has evolved amid neighborhood resistance, particularly to\nmultifamily housing\n. After open houses and resident feedback, the developers revised the proposal to add owner-occupied homes and expand a public park. Even so, concerns over density and building height persisted at the village meeting.\nThe current plan calls for 13 two-story single-family homes, 15 two-story townhouses, four duplex buildings totaling 16 units, 22 three-story townhomes and three apartment buildings \u2014 two rising five stories and one four stories \u2014 for a total of 236 apartment units. Units would range from studios to three-bedroom apartments, with amenities including a pool, fitness center, coworking spaces, dog park and public green space.\nResidents again raised objections at last week\u2019s meeting, warning that high-density rentals could alter the character of the surrounding single-family neighborhood. Developers countered that traffic, market and pricing studies back up the proposal.\nBeyond the site itself, the redevelopment is tied to broader infrastructure plans, including a long-discussed extension of Maplewood Road aimed at improving access to downtown Cary.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The company now occupies more than 455,000 square feet across the two newest Cityline office towers. Average\nfloor plate size\nin the building is about 47,500 square feet, per CBRE.\nLast summer, the venture capital-funded firm\nleased the entire seven-story building\nnext door at 200 West Washington Avenue, securing 305,000 square feet there. It was the company\u2019s first outpost in Sunnyvale and its third in the Bay Area.\nDatabricks\n\u2019 Cityline office expansion is the latest instance of an\nAI firm doubling down on in-person work\nas the booming AI sector takes up more office space across the Bay Area and workers move into the region in droves. AI companies currently occupy at least 6 million square feet of offices across Silicon Valley alone, according to the Business Times. Databricks\u2019 expansion at Cityline was among the largest leases of the fourth quarter.\nLast quarter, Silicon Valley recorded 2.9 million square feet of positive net absorption, meaning more space was leased than vacated, per\nCBRE data\ncited by the Business Times. Office vacancy dropped for a fifth consecutive quarter to 16.1 percent. Technology and AI were the biggest drivers of major office leasing, comprising approximately 85 percent of leases.\nOpenAI and Anthropic have been pursuing a similar strategy of office expansion in a concentrated cluster near their San Francisco headquarters. OpenAI is\nreportedly in talks to lease\nbetween 200,000 to 250,000 square feet in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay, which would bring its local office footprint to more than 1 million square feet.

        "content": "After years of false starts and fizzled plans, Southstar now takes the reins for potential development of San Antonio\u2019s long vacated and crumbling Lone Star Brewery site, as the developer acquired the 32-acre property near Southtown.\nThe New Braunfels-based firm confirmed the acquisition Friday, purchasing the property at 600 Lone Star Boulevard from San Antonio-based GrayStreet Partners and Houston-based Midway, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe sellers\nbought the site\nin 2020 for about $14.5 million and later pitched a sweeping $709 million mixed-use proposal dubbed the Lone Star District. That plan stalled amid rising interest rates, construction costs and cooling rent growth. Terms of Southstar\u2019s purchase were not disclosed, though the property was last assessed at $18.6 million by the Bexar Central Appraisal District.\nSouthstar CEO Thad Rutherford framed the acquisition as both a redevelopment move and a preservation effort, pointing to the site\u2019s iconic smokestack and its deep roots in San Antonio\u2019s working class history. Company leaders stressed that progress will depend on extensive public engagement and coordination with public agencies.\nThe Lone Star site sits near several major public investments already in the pipeline, including VIA Metropolitan Transit\u2019s transit-oriented development plans, the San Antonio River Authority\u2019s long-term river improvements, and ongoing development downtown and\nsouth of downtown\n. Southstar said it intends to align its plans with those initiatives, a signal that any redevelopment will likely be large, mixed-use and phased over several years.\nIn 2021, the city granted $24 million in public incentives to help fund the project, though when news came that GrayStreet was shopping the property, officials asserted that the $24 million incentive package wouldn\u2019t apply if a new developer took over, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nSouthstar\nis also seeking to buy nearby parcels owned by the Newell family that operated as a recycling facility and CPS Energy, including a defunct power plant across the river on Mission Road, the Express-News\nreported\n. If those deals close, Southstar could control more than 70 acres on both sides of a quiet stretch of the river.\nGrayStreet managing partner Kevin Covey said last month that his firm and\nMidway\nwould remain financial partners in the project and that Southstar would likely build off existing plans. A Southstar spokesperson confirmed to the Express-News that GrayStreet provided seller financing, effectively acting as the lender on the deal.\nThe brewery closed in 1996 and has since cycled through at least five failed redevelopment attempts, derailed by environmental issues, capital constraints and bankruptcies. According to the city\u2019s website, the facility opened in 1940 as commercial brewing operations outgrew the historic Lone Star Brewery site at 200 West Jones Avenue. That building was constructed between 1895 and 1904 and now houses the San Antonio Museum of Art.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

County\nincreased\nin both 2024 and 2025 since hitting a post-pandemic low in 2023, Commercial Observer reported, citing a fourth-quarter\nreport\nfrom Kidder Mathews. Almost 30,000 units across L.A. County traded hands in 2025, up from fewer than 20,000 units sold in 2020, which was even lower than the peak pandemic figures of 2020.\nMeasure ULA\n, the controversial transfer tax that levies between 4 and 5.5 percent on property sales higher than $5 million, was enacted in April 2023. The legislation appeared to scare away investors, as a study by the University of California, Los Angeles, last year found that multifamily sales volume fell by as much as 50 percent after Measure ULA was enacted, per CO. Kidder Mathews\u2019 new report seemingly upholds those findings, noting a large drop in unit sales between 2022 and 2023 before the rebound of the past two years. Total revenue from Measure ULA since its enactment\nsurpassed $1 billion\nearlier this month.\nThe latest sales volume numbers in L.A. County indicate that investor demand is improving despite the increased tax liability and property prices. Average multifamily unit price fell 3 percent year-over-year to $278,000, according to Kidder Mathews\u2019 report, while average rent prices were flat compared to 2024. Vacancy hit 5.6 percent and has been trending upward every year since 2021, per CO.\nMultiple nine-figure deals closed in the fourth quarter. Last month, Madison International Realty made the priciest multifamily purchase last quarter with the\n$161.2 million acquisition\nof the El Centro Apartments &amp; Bungalows in Hollywood. The second-priciest sale of the quarter was Carmel Partners\u2019 $141 million pickup of the\nStella apartments in Marina del Rey\n, followed by Kennedy Wilson spending $135 million for The Chadwick in Koreatown, and Eagle Partners dropping $107 million for the Hills at Hacienda Heights residential community.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An industrial site in Fremont has traded hands in one of the city\u2019s larger recent infill sales in the sector.\nThe 26-acre industrial property at 41777 Boyce Road in Fremont\nsold to a Chicago-based buyer\nfor $70.1 million, the San Francisco Business Times and\nMercury News\nreported. The seller was 41777 Boyce Road LLC, an entity tied to concrete contractor Walters &amp; Wolf, according to the state\u2019s business\ndatabase\n. The buyer was CDECRE LLC, a group\naffiliated\nwith Chicago Deferred Exchange Company.\nOther details surrounding the deal, including price, were not disclosed. Newmark\u2019s Steven Golubchik, Edmund Najera, Darren Hollak and Brendan Raney represented both the buyer and the seller in the transaction.\nThe Fremont property includes three buildings totaling more than 110,000 square feet. They were built in 1969 and remodeled in 1975. The parcel is zoned for general industrial use, allowing for manufacturing, wholesale operations and other industrial uses, and is surrounded by other industrial properties.\nHow the site will be used by its new owner remains to be seen. The sale \u201cpositions the site to support next-generation advanced manufacturing, powered by exceptional infrastructure and utility access,\u201d Donovan Lazaro, Fremont\u2019s economic development director, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to connect Fremont\u2019s industrial past with its technological future.\u201d\nFremont overall is an attractive industrial market for investors, with a lower vacancy rate for such properties and a higher number of industrial sites clustered together compared to other cities, according to the Business Times. Earlier this month,\nTishman Speyer bought\nan industrial building at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street in Fremont for $92.9 million.\nLast June, Prologis grew its Bay Area holdings with the purchase of a 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. In October 2024, Prologis\npurchased a four-building office and research park\nat 46859, 46871, 46889 and 46897 Bayside Parkway for $71.3 million. In August 2023, the San Francisco-based firm bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial property at\n48350 Fremont Boulevard\nfor $86.6 million. The same month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
